PROJECT
HAMMER
Covert
Finance, the Parallel Economy & Elite Actions
By David Guyatt
Project Hammer is all about money.
Stupendous great gobs of money.
So much money, in fact, that it will challenge whatever reality
you thought you had about the over-world of banking, finance and
economics.
It is also about the nether world of international
banking and finance, a world that is said not to exist in reality.
But exist it does. More often than not this never-never-land of international
banking is concealed from public view by the judicious use of two sets
of books. It is also
eclipsed from interested investigators by a never-ending series of
real frauds that result in arrest and imprisonment of numerous scam
artists. This creates the clever illusion that the only thing going on
are artful scams designed to fleece the unwary.
Such swindles fall under the general category of High
Yield Investment Programmes, Front End Fee frauds and
"Prime Bank Note" schemes.
Numerous law enforcement cases such as these, when twinned with
dire beware warnings published on FBI, US Treasury and other
websites, easily lead one to conclude that there are no such things as
real trading programmes. And
the powers that be dont at all object to this conclusion being
reached. It is the old
case of hiding trees in a forest.
A key point to keep to the fore in what follows is
that trading programmes operate off-ledger.
That is to say the banks and central banks that operate them
run two sets of books one set for public scrutiny and another set
for private viewing only. Another
fact to bear in mind is that authorised programmes generate quite
spectacular profits for very little, in fact, miniscule risk, and
those that are invited to participate as funders, accumulate capital
at a shockingly rapid rate. One
reason, perhaps, why the wealthy get altogether wealthier as the poor
sink ever lower into the mire of poverty.
The financial, banking and economic shadow-world in
which Project Hammer lived, breathed and manufactured money out of
thin air is the dirty little secret of the western
economy. It is a form of money creation that is effectively unchallenged by any form of oversight or
accountability as we understand it.
Hammer and numerous other transactions like it are based
on what are known as Collateral Trading Programmes although
many other descriptive names and terms are also used.
The reason for such programmes is to create vast
pools of ready money that are earmarked for use in sanctioned
(authorised) operations and projects.
On the plus side, many beneficial projects throughout the world
get funded as a result of programme trading.
On the negative side, there are more shadowy projects.
Included in the latter category are certain black operations.
The amalgamated pool of funds created and now held in
dormant and orphaned bank accounts run to trillions of dollars,
according to insiders. At the low end of estimates there is
believed to be enough to pay off the US national debt plus some
change. At the higher end, estimates range up to hundreds of
trillions of dollars. I have been repeatedly told, almost
matter-of-factly, that the higher estimates are closer to the
truth. I simply don't know how big the sums amount to but I can
document $12 trillion. This sum is revealed in the late Baron
Krupp papers that form part of the exhibits of companion volume to
this dossier, THE SECRET GOLD TREATY (http://www.deepblacklies.co.uk).
Many different sources say that programmes are also
used to launder money by spinning it through a programme cycle until
it is pristine clean. Drugs,
guns and the usual array of dirty money transactions are said to
feature.
Since US dollars are the corner-stone of all
programme activity, Uncle Sam naturally gets a bite of the action.
A percentage of the proceeds are collected via private tax
treaties negotiated with off-shore entities.
These treaties also help to shield the reality of these
programmes from public awareness. There are unsubstantiated rumours that some of the tax take
occasionally gets diverted for altogether private purposes.
It is an allegation that is impossible to stand up, however.
London and Zurich are key centres for programme
activity although transactions are usually booked through off-shore
entities. London &
Zurich are also gold centres and more than one credible source
confirms that black gold form an important part of programme trading
activity. There are also
good reasons to suppose that part of Uncle Sams share of trading
profits are credited to the Exchange Stabilisation Fund.
Here it is pooled with other funds and used to shore-up the
American economy by amongst other manoeuvres - manipulating the
gold price to keep it below a pre-determined price.
Trading programmes are the preserve of many
governments, their treasury departments and the top international
banks which by very nature have the necessary mechanisms in place to
enable trading to take place efficiently and secretly.
Banks from G7 nations dominate.
It follows therefore, that a number of problems occur as a
consequence of the multi-jurisdictional nature of supervision, and
although safeguards are in place to ensure that clean money is
fed into the system, this doesnt always happen.
Funds of suspect origin do enter the system and are made
pristine clean by this form of paper alchemy.
Large sums of black gold, cash or other forms
of convertible assets are used as collateral to initiate trading
programmes. There are
also certain classes of government issued Treasury Notes and Bonds
that are privately lodged into major western banks.
These treasuries are never meant to see the light of day
but are, in turn, used by major banks to back the issuance of their
own bank debentures off-ledger in substantially leveraged
amounts that can run into tens of trillions of dollars - or their
foreign currency equivalents. In
turn, this bank paper is traded in pre-arranged buy/sell
transactions at steep discounts (cents on the dollar) of the face
value of the issued bank debentures.
The trading of the paper between banks using proxies - is
arranged and coordinated so that the traded obligations effectively
wash out or are otherwise cancelled, although other scenarios
exist where issued paper is purchased at a fair market value and held
to maturity. In the past
trading was paper based but today everything is electronic screen-based
and consequently, the credits traded have a life of milliseconds.
The difference between the buy and sell price -
usually known as the spread (in the case of Hammer this was said
to be many percentage points) generates a fallout - a term that
implies profit. In other
transactions, most notably Jacobe, the spread was represented to
be at least 10% on a planned face value issuance of US$27.5 trillion
according to documents I have seen.
This would have created a fallout of US$2.75 trillion.
However, for reasons yet unknown to this writer it seems that
the Jacobe programme, privately hailed as the largest programme ever
put together was, for reasons that are still inexplicable, only two
thirds completed.
Less grand but just as interesting in other respects
was the fallout from Project Hammer that is said to have totalled over
US$220 billion. In fact,
the precise sum is US$ 223,104,000,008.03.
One of the central characters associated with
Project Hammer was Brigadier General Erle Cocke.
Back in 1966 along with his sleeping partner General Eugene
Phillips, Erle Cocke established the Washington based consultancy firm
Cocke & Phillips International.
This was at the height of the Vietnam war and just a few months
after cold warrior Paul H Nitze, issued the directive authorising the
establishment of the US Navys clandestine intelligence collection
programme more commonly known as Task Force 157.
TF 157 would later feature in the Nugan Hand Bank
affair exposed by Wall Street Journal investigative reporter
Jonathan Kwitny, in his book THE CRIMES OF PATRIOTS.
Task Force157 came to an end on the instruction of Admiral
Bobby Ray Inman once he discovered the full involvement of rogue
CIA agent Edwin Wilson in the Task Force.
Wilson was responsible for so much intrigue and illegality that
one could shake a stick at it. He
was eventually arrested, tried and imprisoned where he remains to this
day fighting for release. Many
now believe that he was working on orders from above but in a deniable
role and was cynically sacrificed to save other more prominent
players.
During his investigation, Jonathan Kwitny learned
that General Erle Cocke ran Nugan Hand Banks Washington office.
Cockes partner, General Philipps denied this saying they had
merely rented office space to Nugan Hand Inc's., Hawaii President,
General Edward Black a former OSS, CIA and senior military
officer. This proved to
be untrue however. Kwitny
learned that papers filed with the U S Treasury listed General Cocke
as the person in charge of Nugan Hands Washington office.
Cocke claimed that someone else must have filed these papers
without his knowledge or consent.
In April 2000, Cocke gave a deposition running to 67
pages concerning his knowledge and involvement in Project Hammer.
Ten days later he died from Pancreatic cancer.
His explosive deposition reveals him as a very significant and
highly connected player in a world few of us are familiar with
Cocke fought in three wars: WWII, Korea and Vietnam.
During WWII he was an artillery officer and a division staff
officer and was a POW under the Germans.
He worked for General MacArthur during the Korean war and for
General Westmoreland in the Vietnam war.
Highly decorated for his service he was awarded a Silver Star,
a Bronze Star and cluster, a Purple Heart with three clusters, a Croix
de Guerre plus a Chevalier Legion of Honour (France) and a Medal of
Honour from the Philippines. He
was the youngest National Commander of the American Legion and prior
to his death also became the oldest National Commander.
In addition he was distinguished by the Red Cross with the
medal Cruz Roja and was made an Honourable Comrade of the Nationalist
Chinese Air Force.
He was a Shriner Mason of many years standing (where
he held a semi-official voluntary position for that organisation) and
was a Grand Commander of the Knights of Malta the secretive
Vatican Order that boasts numerous members who serve or are
closely affiliated with western intelligence and military
services. Intriguingly,
he claimed to have been the first Protestant in 1200 years to be so
honoured.
In 1959 and again in 1960 he was a member of the U.
S. delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations holding
the rank (and pay grade) of Ambassador.
After that he was the first full time U. S. alternate Executive
Director of the World Bank, a position he held for four years from
1961-4. Pressed about this in more detail Cocke responded saying:
At
that time I owned 28 percent of the stock and, of course, I had all
kinds of people in the Treasury tell me what to do.
Dont get me wrong, I made all the decisions.
But I was the executor, I was the delivery.
He also confirmed that he had worked for every US
President:
from
Truman to date. At some
stage of the game I worked for all of them.
I have to admit that some of them were very minor chores and
others were important.
In addition to his many abilities and accomplishments
listed above Erle Cocke was above all other things a banker, a
profession that ran in the family.
His great grandfather put a bank together in 1867 which
was then the only bank in Georgia.
His grandfather founded a bank in about 1890 and his father was
President of Fulton National Bank (which became Bank of America) and
was, at one time, the President of the American Bankers Association
and Chairman of the FDIC.
Asked about his own knowledge of banking Cocke said
he had taken all the normal banking courses and added:
I
understand banking. I can
teach banking you understand what I am saying at the college
level.
This banking expertise was at the core of his firm,
Cocke & Phillips International which began life as a:
normal
American firm, lobbying firm here in Washington, and we grew into
banking particularly. The
UN contacts, and the World Bank contacts, sometimes they help those
people for 10 years.
In a similar vein he undertook all sorts of chores
for some of the government intelligence agencies. He explained this as follows:
One
thing is if they trusted you, they practically came in and said what
do I do? I mean, you didnt argue with them. You sort of proceeded with the program and gave them a few
choices, of course. But
[they] practically always followed what we did.
I was administrator, arbitrator.
I was [the] moderator, bringing people together.
Asked if that experience would be true in the
financial and banking world in particular? Cocke replied:
Oh, yes. I have been able to close things that other people cant
close.
As we shall see, Cockes ability to close
things other people could not close did not extend to Project Hammer,
a financial operation that, according to Cocke, deeply involved
Citibank and its Chairman, John Reed.
Cocke said he could get to see any President without any
trouble, but complained that he could not get to meet John Reed.
Having briefly examined General Cockes background
and Vitae, lets now return to that stupendous sum of black
money mentioned earlier. For
purposes of clarity this amount was referenced in Erle Cockes
deposition. If, as we have said, this amount was stealthily magicked
into being as a result of an exotic form of financial smoke and
mirrors the question is where did it go?
According to Cocke this sum was lodged in:
30
some odd accounts together.
Asked where these accounts were located, Cocke
responded saying:
In
almost one solid block at Citibank.
General Cockes questioner, a Washington attorney
then asked: Would they have been in control of Mr. Reed
meaning former Citibank CEO and Chairman John Reed.
Cocke responded as follows:
A
Probably not all because there were so many different
participants involved, and in different locations, countries, that I
would say no, he did not have complete control, but everybody
recognized it wouldnt be settled until it got to him.
Q
And these were, you say, accounts for various people around the
world?
A
Yes.
Q
Produced as a result of what?
A
Well, most of them figured that greed in particular was mighty
high. And, if they put up
this amount of money, then I am going to get this kind of money coming
back. Thats the way
practically all of it was. I
hate to use the word sole, but present might be a better word.
Q
Were these accounts for the benefit of people who had engaged
in some kind of trading program?
A
They were all to get in the trading program.
I havent found anybody that didnt go in wanting to
increase their income and their greed in the highest bracket if they
could possibly put up money.
Q
What I am understanding from you is that whatever these
individuals, corporate entities, or even government, they believed
apparently by putting these funds with Citibank as part of this
effort, they would then receive later down the road a pay off?
A
That is correct.
Q
As a result of Citibanks management of these funds, is that
fair to say?
A
Yes, basically the whole trading bloc in a nutshell.
During the course of his deposition, General Cocke
was asked if he knew who created Hammer to begin with
?
He admitted that he didnt know and was even reluctant to
make a guess but added that whoever set it in motion had to have
been somebody at a pretty high level.
He then made the interesting observation that whoever it was
who had authorised the original structure that it had obviously
got way out of proportion as time went by.
The implication was that some of the money the fallout
got diverted from its original intention.
More than a few of those involved in Project Hammer,
at various levels, have told me that they believe some of the pool of
money created by the Hammer project was diverted and used to
rescue many of the worlds major banks who by the very end of the 1980s
faced insolvency following reckless lending policies throughout the
late Seventies and early-middle Eighties.
it is certainly true that at that time many major banks like
Citibank, HSBC, Chase, BoNY and others stood teetering on the very brink of
disaster.
Another view is one that has been expressed by Daniel
Hughes, of Hughes Oil Company, a Florida based Corporation.
Hughes had been heavily involved in finding collateral to place
in a number of trading programs over several years.
This has cost him tens of thousands of dollars since most of
these were illegitimate rather than genuine.
It is a fate that waits for untold thousands of unsuspecting
investors who step into this shadowy realm unprepared.
Even so it seems that Hughes did play a part in
attempting to place collateral in Project Hammer. He believes that the funds diverted from Project Hammer ended
up in a CIA controlled Swiss bank account in the name of late Howard
Hughes. Based on years of
investigation, Hughes believes that Project Hammer involved the
trading of US$13.6 trillion in debentures resulting in a fallout
of about US$1.1 trillion which was stashed in the Howard Hughes
account in Credit Suisse. Whilst
there is no hard corroboration in support of this claim it remains an
intriguing possibility. More
so for in his deposition, General Cocke indicated that black money
generated by trading programmes might be hidden in dormant accounts,
and a Howard Hughes account set up thirty years ago would clearly fall
into that category.
According to Erle Cocke plus others I have spoken
with, Project Hammer began life as an authorised but secretive trading
programme aimed at repatriating dollar assets that dated back several
decades. Cocke confirms
this when asked:
Q
-- what the overall objectives of Project Hammer were?
A
Well, it was mainly to bring monies back to the United States
from all types of activities, both legitimately and illegitimately.
Not that they were in the smuggling business per se, but they were all
in the arms business, they were all retracing dollars of one
description or another that had accumulated all through the forties
and fifties really. And
that probably is as broad a definition as I can give you.
And all kinds of nationalities were involved, all kinds of
people were involved
Cocke was then asked who would have been behind the
Hammer project. Would it,
the questioner asked, have involved:
Q
various agencies of the U. S. Government?
A
Yes. Obviously,
the CIA, the FBI, the National Security Agencies of all types,
Pentagon in the broadest sense of it and as such, and the Treasury,
Federal Reserve. Nobody
got out of the act, everybody wanted to get in the act.
But there were numerous other entities involved in
Project Hammer. None more
so than the worlds big bank as is made clear by the following
exchange:
Q
What other banks and financial institutions were involved in
it?
A
Well, if they were, they were still as a correspondent to
Citibank
A
"Correspondent" in the sense General Cocke's uses this term
means one banks account maintained at another bank. This is used
to handle money transfers between both banks and very often denotes a
"special relationship" between the the banks
concerned. The questioner then asks:
Q
Do you know which of those would be involved, was Chase
Manhattan one?
A
I am sure that every big bank in every major country at some
stage of the game had some of this pass by them.
They had a chance to refuse, or they had a chance to take it
up.
CITIBANK ARE THE CHEESE
Cocke was then asked who the dominant participant
was in terms of running this project, this vast project?
The general is in no doubt about his reply when he says that,
based on his own investigation, it was: Citibank of New York, in
both their Athens, Greece office and in their New York City office.
He also acknowledged that Hammer was part of an ongoing long
term kind of project.
Cocke went on to reveal that Citibank were
going to be the trustees. They
were going to be running the program.
They were going to be the disbursing agency.
They were the cheese.
Asked to identify which principal officer in Citibank
handled Project Hammer, Cocke responded that from all records,
communications and contacts, John Reed was Vice President, but he was
the lone coordinator, for a better word.
Reed, who was Citibanks President and Chairman
during this period has formally denied his involvement in Project
Hammer. In a deposition
sworn in December 2000, Reed states that he has no recognition or
knowledge of anything purportedly known as project Hammer.
Nor did he have any recognition or knowledge of any
person named Erle Cocke. His
deposition goes on to list a number of other items, people and
allegations that he also had no recognition or knowledge about.
For their part, Citibank in a letter dated December
12th 2000 state that they never issued commercial
instruments on the basis of its possession of quantities of gold made
available to it by agencies of the U.S. Government and the Federal
Reserve in order to ensure the solvency of Citibank in the 80s and
other bullion banks.
This denial, although emphatic, is interesting.
Research shows that gold recovered by the forerunner to the
CIA, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was deposited in Citibank
(and many other banks, too) not in the name of the OSS or CIA but in
the name of one of their operatives, Severino Garcia Santa Romana.
On his death in 1974, some but not all - of
Romanas assets appear to have been illegally acquired by
former Philippines President, Ferdinand Marcos, who was at one time
Santa Romanas attorney. According
to Santa Romanas widow, her husband gave Marcos a limited Power of
Attorney for use solely in the Philippines, since he travelled abroad
regularly. Marcos, somehow, seems to have made use of this to gain
control over Santa Romanas gold and other assets.
It also appears likely, based on documents in this
writers possession that considerable quantities of gold once held
by Santa Romana were later placed under the control of former CIA
covert operator, Major General Edward Lansdale.
These assets were, however, lodged with the Union Bank of
Switzerland. Again it is
worthy of note that they were placed in Ed Lansdales name not in
the name of a U S Government Agency.
These assets are very clearly off the books.
Large quantities of gold held by Citibank remained in
the account names of Severino Garcia Sta. Romana and Jose Antonio Diaz
De La Paz (the latter being a well -known a.k.a for Santa Romana)
under reference codes Fanerst King Fisher and Burgst Harbour
King respectively. These have
been the subject of a legal wrangle between Santa Romanas heirs and
Citibanks John Reed.
The fact that the gold held by Citibank and others
may not have been in the name of the Central Intelligence Agency or
the Federal Reserve but rather was in Santa Romanas name may have
been all Citibank needed to wriggle out of a poorly crafted question.
THE ILLUMINATI
ANGLE
The gold connection remains unclear.
However, there is reason to suppose that the dollar assets
that date back to the 1940s and 1950s as earlier discussed by
General Erle Cocke may relate in part, to vast quantities of gold
looted during WWII by the Japanese plunder teams known as the Golden
Lily and also by the Nazis in Europe.
That substantial amounts of gold bullion were
ransacked and then hidden throughout the Philippines prior to wars end
is now undeniable. This,
however, was black gold, meaning it did not appear on official
statistics or in treasury department lists.
Santa Romana was an OSS officer operating in the Philippines
during the war and learned where the Japanese had buried plundered
gold and other valuables.
But there are other aspects to the Santa Romana gold
story that are only now coming to the surface.
They reveal a shocking secret that, if true, could shake the
foundations of our belief and change the way in which we view the
world we live in.
According to Santa Romanas widow, Luz, her husband
told her that he was a member of the Illuminati a very secretive
elite group that dates back to 1776 when it was founded by Adam
Weishaupt at the University of Ingolstadt, Germany.
According to those who have researched it, the purpose of the
Illuminati was to set in motion, in secret, a New World Order of world
revolution.
This, however, does not fully tally with what Santa
Romana told his wife about them.
According to Luz the purpose of the Illuminati was based on the
knowledge that the royal families of Europe were aware that they were
losing political and effective control of their nations. But it was the possible loss of control over the wealth of
their kingdoms that bothered them most.
Consequently they founded the Illuminati and set in
motion long-term plans aimed at secretly taking control of world
finances, especially gold and other precious metals.
In time the royal families who sat at the centre of
the Illuminati movement were forced to expand and take into membership
political and business leaders. At
some point in the early twentieth century two fifty year plans were
set in motion aimed at cornering the worlds precious metal reserves.
The foregoing is the account given to Luz by her
husband Santa Romana. How
true it is remains to be seen and it is not hard to view it as
disinformation told by Santa Romana to his wife to conceal his real
motives whatever they may have been.
More intriguing still is Luzs account that her
late husband was the one time head of the Trilateral Commission
an elite group that is known to have tentacles deeply embedded in
the Marcos gold story of later years.
Again, there is no corroborating evidence and the fact that the
Trilateral Commission was founded only in 1973 whereas Santa
Romana died in 1974 suggests this is unlikely.
However, it is more than a little curious that whilst
the great bulk of gold that eventually (and undoubtedly) came to be
controlled by Santa Romana resulted from plunder during WWII, he did
have substantial gold deposits dating back further than that.
Papers relating to the estate of Santa Romana
purport to show a gold account at the Union Bank of Switzerland,
Zurich, containing 8,000 metric tonnes that was valued at US$10
billion. The account
dates back to 1920. Such
a quantity of gold dating from that period represents a massive
holding far surpassing that held today by the worlds leading central
banks.
It is also at least interesting that, again according
to the account of his wife, Santa Romana was, as a young boy, adopted
by his great uncle in Hawaii who was married to the last Hawaiian
princess. The couple had
remained childless throughout their marriage leading to the decision
to adopt the young Santa Romana.
According to Luz, it was this royal connection that gave
Santa Romana entrée into the Illuminati said to have once been
dominated by royal families.
Interestingly, during the course of my on-going
investigation into Project Hammer, a number of others involved in this
program I have spoken with have told me, quite independently of the
Santa Romana story, that the Hammer program and numerous other
collateral trading programs associated with it have enormously
powerful gold trusts of royal origin sitting behind them.
Perhaps the Hammer program was to generate enough
money to buy substantial quantities of black gold stashed in the
Philippines to ensure it is kept out of circulation thus
protecting the gold price to some degree?
Perhaps it had more to do with the secret acquisition of vast
amounts of this black gold in line with what Santa Romana told his
wife? Perhaps the assets
in question were not just gold but included pre-war US Treasury
obligations (Bonds and Notes) that are now coming to light in the
Philippines but which are said by US authorities to be fraudulent.
What ever is the case, it is certain that substantial
quantities of black gold are used to underpin (collateralise)
certain trading programs and the funds thus generated are earmarked
for use in other secretive operations?
This whole subject remains an ongoing investigation.
The deeper I dig the murkier it becomes.
Stories of warehouses full of banknotes waiting to be laundered
by a trading programme so that they can re-enter the financial system
as clean as a whistle are commonplace.
Foreign exchange transactions involving billions of dollars in
equivalent currency and which trade at huge discounts - unknown in the
official marketplace - are also not uncommon.
It is also a fact that many of those involved in
trading programmes are members of government intelligence and security
organisations.
EXECUTIVE
OUTCOMES, SANDLINE, AND THE STASI
Another individual who has played a
considerable role in Project Hammer is South African, Rolf van Rooyen,
who operated a number of business entities including one called Oceantech
and another called Eastech International Bank.
At one time van Rooyen worked for South African intelligence and
is also believed to have been CIA at the time Project Hammer was in
process.
Of significance is the fact that
General Cocke and van Rooyen knew each other, although Cocke says he
only spoke to him on the phone but never shook hands with him.
During a police interview in Germany in 1995, van Rooyen when
questioned about Project Hammer responded:
If you are
referring to Operation Hamer (sic) it is an extremely large, very
delicate operation in co-operation with the authorities of various
countries in which Oceantech is involved.
Van Rooyen then proceeds to
identify: America, England, Germany, France, Italy
as being
involved. He also told
German police that from the very first day he began investigating
Project Hammer that
We realised
that it was a direct state matter and that the U.S.A., the CIA and
several other groups in the secret service were involved, as well as
very, very high-coupled people in the American Government.
The latter are rumoured to include
George H. W. Bush, James Baker III. Former Treasury Secretary Lloyd
Bentsen and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
During his deposition Erle Cocke was
asked if he considered van Rooyens foregoing statement to be
accurate. Cocke replied
saying He is not too far off. I
am sure he flavoured it up a little bit, yes.
Working alongside van Rooyen was
South African intelligence operative Riaan Stander.
Both Stander and van Rooyen were board members of the Eastcorp
Syndicate which boasted almost two dozen other companies in its
stable. Included were
Intercol Pty, Ltd., Cavo Shipping which conducted intelligence
gathering missions for governments and Bridge S. A.
The latter was registered in Monrovia, Liberia.
According to Peter Goslar, once a
close friend of Riaan Stander, other board members of Bridge S. A., were
Colonel Tim Spicer and Mick Ranger of Sandline fame.
In a letter written to a Washington law firm involved in a
lawsuit involving Project Hammer, Goslar fingers Bridge S A and
hence van Rooyen and Riaan Stander as part of the Executive
Outcomes operation.
But there is more.
During several daylong meetings I had with Peter Goslar in late
June 2001, he handed me hundreds of pages of documents he had retrieved
from Riaan Standers private papers.
These included documents showing a Mexican entity called Ro-Mar
Pharmaceuticals that van Rooyan told German police was the money
power behind Eastech International Bank.
The money Ro-Mar Pharmaceutical claimed to control was
represented by over US$100 billion in gold. Other
papers clearly show van Rooyen and Stander engaged in Collateral Trading
Programmes involving Latin American Governments, most notably Argentina
once the preferred bold-hole of notorious Nazis like Martin
Bormann.
Another document from the batch I
received from Peter Goslar was a list of companies listed under the
heading United Kingdom Network and identified this network
as being part of The Palace Group.
An interesting description, I think.
In any event, listed under this group were twenty-four
business entities including Sandline International, Diamond Works,
Branch Mining Ltd and Bridge International.
The list also included Defence Systems Ltd as a part of The
Palace Group and identified it as a division of Vickers - Britains
oldest and most distinguished armaments manufacturer and which resides
at the very centre of the United Kingdoms Establishment.
During one of our meetings, Peter
Goslar told me he was a personal acquaintance (perhaps even a friend) of
former East German spy-master, Marcus Wolf, who headed the East German
security apparatus known as the Stasi.
Peter also claimed to know several former Stasi operatives.
He also spoke German fluently in addition to Afrikaans and his
native English tongue.
I later was told that a Peter Goslar
was briefly mentioned in the autobiography written by Marcus Wolf
entitled MAN WITHOUT A FACE. Discussing
the fall from grace of West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in 1977,
following the discovery that his personal secretary, Dagmar
Kahlig-Scheffler was a spy working for the Stasi.
Wolf explains that Chancellor Schmidts spy-cum-secretary was
caught when her Stasi control officer, Peter Goslar came under suspicion
by West German counterintelligence.
I asked Peter if he was the same
Peter Goslar identified by his friend Marcus Wolf.
He denied that it was him. Non-the-less,
he told me that Rolf van Rooyen was still living in Germany and was
under the protection of two former Stasi agents.
And we do know that the Stasi worked closely and in the shadows
with South African intelligence on a variety of projects, mostly weapon
related. Curious.
The Palace group meanwhile,
contains all the guile and charm of a privatised off-the-books appendage
of Britains Secret Intelligence Service (SIS).
On the other side of the Atlantic, General Cocke and his firm
Cocke & Phillips International has many similarities as its
foregoing British cousin and probably was (and is the firm remains
active) one of the CIAs private off-the-books companies.
This conclusion is not only drawn from Cockes affiliation with
the known CIA entity, Nugan Hand Bank, but another CIA front company
called Associated Traders Corporation.
ATC, as it is known, came into brief
prominence some years ago following a series of articles written by
syndicated columnist, Jack Anderson naming Associated Traders as an a
gun running, money laundering off-the-books CIA front.
Then in 1988 a US$4 million lawsuit was filed that involved
Associated Traders. By
1990, Director of the CIA, William Webster, issued an Affidavit calling
for a sweeping gag order by asserting that it was a matter of national
security. Of interest is
the fact that more than one source has told me that Associated Traders
Corporation was General Cocke.
The foregoing connections could
easily be typified as part of the Anglo-American-African covert
intelligence relationship that continues to conceal many sins.
There is reason to suppose that part of funds derived from the
Project Hammer financial trading programme went to fund certain military
and intelligence operations in South African.
These are thought to have included financing of the so called Hammer
Units that are alleged to have engaged in brutal beatings and
assassinations throughout South Africa prior to the collapse of the
Apartheid regime. It is
also believed that Hammer funds were used to finance the purchase of
arms given to the Inkatha Freedom Party that was engaged in widespread
acts of bloody violence during 1992 and 1993 as discussed in the 1994
Report of the Goldstone Commission of Inquiry that named Eastech, VAN
Rooyen and Stander.
Another aspect of Project Hammer may
have involved the desire to plunder South Africa of much of its
available mineral wealth prior to the country coming under control of
the ANC in 1994. In the hard-hitting and suppressed book GLITTER & GREED
written by Australian investigative reporter, Janine Roberts, the
Oppenheimer family and De Beers arranged that a:
fabulous
multi-billion Rand stockpile of the finest gems was shipped out prior to
the 1994 elections and that the mines producing the best gems were put
into overdrive in both South Africa and Namibia so that as many as
possible of the better gems were extracted as fast as possible.
I have also been told that large
quantities of South African gold were also surreptitiously shipped out
of South Africa at around this time presumably for similar reasons.
It is also of interest to note that mounting evidence points to
the conclusion that since 1995 the price of gold has been kept purposely
low as a result of a conspiracy engineered by the US Treasury department
in collaboration with leading international banks. The result has been that the cost of extracting gold for many
South African gold mines is no longer cost effective.
Could some of this alleged missing
South African gold be related to a transaction that van Rooyen and
Stander entered into in 1991? This
involved Eastech International Bank agreeing to purchase 5,000 metric
tonnes of gold at a 4% discount from the prevailing Second London fix
at a cost of about US$50 billion.
This gold was held in the free zone area beneath Zurichs
Kloten airport. The
contract, which was to be governed by the canton-laws of Zurich
runs to six pages and each page bears the official stamp of the Swiss
police authorising and validating the transaction.
It remains unclear if van Rooyen and
Stander were acting on their own behalf or were fronting for someone
else in this transaction. Van
Rooyen, at least, has been fingered as a CIA asset in addition to his
South African intelligence affiliations.
Might they have been operating as a deniable cut out for the
US Treasury Department who wished to get delivery of this gold?
Perhaps the Chinese Government was
party to the transaction instead. Eastech
International Bank was, after all, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Sino-Eastech, an entity which van Rooyen told German police
investigators was established in China and which operates from
Xin Xong and was originally established by the General Staff of the 7th
military power in China. In
operating their bank, Van Rooyen and Stander liased with a Chinese Army
General who van Rooyen declined to name saying he wasnt sure what
his name is. His German
police interrogator, displaying a well honed sense of official
disinterest in such diplomatic incongruities, rapidly moved on to other
issues.
By 1995 Eastech International Bank
had begun to hit the radar screen of regulatory authorities around the
world that viewed it with suspicion.
But by then it seems probable that much of Project Hammers
South African objectives had been fulfilled.
Fearing the worse, Rolf van Rooyen left South Africa and
travelled to Germany. And according to his one time friend, Peter Goslar, that is
where he still lives albeit protected by former members of East Germanys
Stasi spy-network.
It remains to be seen whether the
sanctions busting objective of the South African end of Project Hammer
was a simple case of certain Elites making sure they got all the mineral
wealth they needed from South Africa before turning the country over to
the ANC and Nelson Mandela in 1994.
What is known is that the price of gold entered a new round of
price manipulation beginning in 1995 which continues to this day.
Over the last two years, the Gold
Anti Trust Action Group (GATA) have demonstrated that the manipulation
of gold price has been orchestrated by the US Federal Reserve working in
collusion with leading Wall Street and international banks.
Many of those banks quoted by GATA as being party to the price
manipulation conspiracy for that is what it amounts to are also
major players in Trading Programmes.
In any event, the depressed price of
gold has made many South African mines uneconomic to operate and one
cannot help but ask if this was by design?
Southern hemisphere nations may sit on much of mineral wealth of
the planet but the northern hemisphere industrialised nations appear
intent to continue to control and exploit it.
THE
FRENCH CONNECTION - AGAIN
Project
Hammer and Jacobe have the appearance of being "umbrella"
operations geared, in the
narrow sense at least, to generating funds for particular authorised
projects. Once the proper authorisation has been issued programmes
such as these seem to broaden in scope and greater effort goes towards
creating deniable slush
funds for use in any number of ways as the occasion demands. When you think about it, this makes considerable sense for
those who engage in the game of black operations and political
manipulation.
In
addition to its authorisation to repatriate dollars dating back to the
1940's and 1950's, as explained by General Cocke, could Project Hammer
have had other purposes? Could it, for example, have been used to
finance another project, one that had specific East German connotations
and which might explain the Stasi connection more fully?
It
is certainly interesting that on the 6th February 1989, the French
Central Bank, the Banque de France, issued an International Certificate
of Deposit for 620,000 kilograms of 99.99% pure gold. At that
time, 620 metric tonnes of gold had a market value of about US$7
billion. A king's ransom.
The
certificate is almost identical to dozens I have on file and which I
have written about and also reproduced in my book, THE SECRET GOLD
TREATY. As I explain there, certificates of this nature invariably
contain spelling mistakes or other obvious typographical flaws which can
be used to deny the validity of the certificate in the event it ever
reaches public attention.
This
was a technique developed by Britain's secretive Special Operations
Executive (SOE) in WWII. SOE agents parachuted into France and
elsewhere in occupied Europe, were taught to insert pre-arranged
spelling errors on messages they sent by radio in the event they were
captured by the Nazi's. This would immediately alert SOE that the
agent was in custody and that German Counter-intelligence wished to use
the agent to feed false information back to HQ.
In
any event, the Banque de France certificate mentioned above was in the
name of Erich Honecker, the then East German Head of State (see
exhibits). Six months later, in a trumpet of media coverage,
Honecker was ousted from power. A month after that, the Berlin
Wall - the very symbol of Communism throughout the world - was
opened. The reopening was abruptly followed by its complete
demolition at the hands of a euphoric public. Germany, which had
been divided for over thirty years was, at least, reunified.
By
many accounts, Project Hammer began trading in November 1989, but was
being set up a lot earlier than that. Few of those involved in the
transaction on the peripherary know for certain what assets were used to
collateralize the transaction, although "black" gold has been
mentioned in numerous telephone conversations and correspondence.
All parties are certain, however, that an element of the backing
collateral was cash.
What
we do know if that Citibank had accounts in the name of Jose Diaz and
Severino Santa Romana. These were bullion accounts dating back to
the years that Santa Romana, General Edward Lansdale and others were
engaged in recovering gold stashed on the Philippines by the Japanese
plunder teams known as the Golden Lily.
Some
of Santa Romana's gold was, at some point in history, converted to
cash. This along with gold and other plunder was deposited in well
over a hundred bank accounts located in over forty countries throughout
the world. These were the deniable assets that made up a
particular CIA slush fund known to insiders in the black gold market as
the "Black Eagle Fund" - a name that was based on the symbol
of the Nazi Eagle.
Part
of these assets were placed under the control of the late Baron von
Krupp. Baron Krupp's personal attorney, Carl Hermann Letemeyer, of
the private Zurich based law firm of Senn, Christians & Letemeyer
handled the Baron's estate following his death.
Documents
I published in THE SECRET GOLD TREATY reveal that out of a fortune of
just over $12 TRILLION that the late Baron controlled, slightly
over $110 billion was earmarked for one Clemente Santiago, a relative of
Candelaria Santiago who was the most "trusted lady" of the
late President Marcos of the Philippines.
Baron Krupp's incredible fortune was
undoubtedly largely composed of Santa Romana's plunder later acquired by
deception by President Marcos, who had earlier been Santa Romana's
lawyer in the Philippines, prior to his rise to political office.
Stories about "Marcos gold" in reality speak of Santa Romana's
gold, and the OSS/CIA's gold - although Marcos did recover vast
quantities for himself via a Philippine Army battalion dedicated to
locating and recovering WWII plunder.
A memorandum under the letterhead of
Senn, Christians & Letemeyer and signed by Carl Herman Letemeyer
(see exhibits) lists four banks accounts which collectively have
balances of US$71 billion. The bulk of this was listed as being
held in account number 4 77 22 P at Standard Chartered International
Truste Limited, London. US$9 billion is shown under account number
LVI 820975 TI at Citicorp, New York. US$12 billion is listed for
Bank of China, Hong Kong, under account number 5555 201HE and US$3
billion in the Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong, account number 78 9520 37
0. The memorandum is dated 3rd October 1989 right in line with the
Hammer and Jacobe trading programmes.
This is more than interesting.
Other information provided to me shows that Standard & Chartered
Bank was deeply involved in the Jacobe programme. According to a
detailed memorandum in my possession, the Trustee of the Jacobe
programme had "arranged that the monies be funneled through a Trust
account..." of this bank.
Citibank, according to General Cocke
and many others who were involved, was "the cheese" behind the
Project Hammer programme. And then there is the Chinese connection
to van Rooyen's Eastech International Bank and van Rooyen's and
Stander's involvement with both Hammer and Jacobe.
The foregoing has merely
scraped the surface of what is an exceptionally complex and extensive
story. A great deal of further investigative work is required to
plumb the depths in order to present a more comprehensive account.
Presently there are more questions than answers.
Project Hammer and Jacobe, meanwhile, are only two of many other trading
programmes presently under investigation by this writer.
Others with names like Redhead, Grandmother and Graystone also
need investigating.
These
programmes eclipse more secrets than you
can wag a dog's tail at. They represent the very pinnacle of
covert
funding for deniable government operations. Slush funds that
have been generated by this process are regularly said to be in the many
trillions of dollars. This is confirmed in the deposition of
General Cocke who argues that the Hammer programme "expanded"
by Dan Hughes in 1989, would have "enhanced" over the decade
and now is worth over one thousand billion dollars. It is also
confirmed by the documents issued by the late Baron von Krupp's Swiss
lawyer which reveal "profits" in excess of US$12
trillion.
Amounts
of this magnitude could punch a massive hole through the shortfalls in
social welfare programmes around the world. Famine could be
virtually eradicated from the face of the earth and death from easily
cured diseases in the southern hemisphere, in particular - which spiral
for lack of money - could easily become a thing of the past. All
this could be achieved if these huge gobs of money were brought in from
the cold and placed on-ledger.
But
there appears no will to do this. Too many difficult questions and
harder to justify explanations block the way. How would G7
governments explain to a cynical public that decades of drug money and
illegal weapon sales proceeds had been laundered with their blessing
(albeit in secret) in order to win the cold war and also to artificially
prop up a political system that we call Capitalism, that would otherwise
collapse under its own inherent flaws?
It took the CIA over six months to respond to a
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking information on Project
Hammer and Jacobe. The
request was denied under exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3) of the FOI Act. Section (b)(1) of the Act applies to material that is properly
classified pursuant to an Executive order in the interest of national
defence or foreign policy, and exemption (b)(3) applies to the CIA
Directors statutory obligation to protect from disclosure
intelligence sources and methods, as well as organization, functions,
names, official titles, salaries or numbers of personnel employed by the
Agency
Appeals are in progress.
