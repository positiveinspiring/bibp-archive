I have always been a bit skeptical about some of the more salacious claims
made in John Perkins'
Confessions of An Economic Hit Man, the story of one
man's life working for the secretive National Security Agency or
NSA.
When
he was a young man, NSA interrogators interviewed Perkins and explored his,
"frustration about the lack of women, sex, and money."
Perkins' fit the NSA's psychological profile, and after being accepted into the
organization's shadowy ranks, he landed a corporate job working as an
economist with a major consulting firm.
It was all a cover, however, for
Perkins' real purpose: as a self-described "economic hit man," the youth was
dispatched to poor Latin American countries such as Panama and Ecuador where
he was tasked with cheating governments out of money and funneling cash from
the coffers of
the World Bank into the hands of major corporations and
wealthy elites.
No doubt, U.S. intelligence agencies partake in such activities all the
time, yet some of Perkins' stories strained my credibility.
For example, the
author discusses a mysterious woman "consultant" at his firm named Claudine
who came to be the young man's teacher.
"My assignment is to mold you into
an economic hit man," she tells Perkins. "No one can know about your
involvement - not even your wife."
Later, Perkins remarks of Claudine,
"Beautiful and intelligent, she was
highly effective; she understood my weaknesses and used them to her greatest
advantage."
"Her approach," Perkins wrote, was a "combination of physical
seduction and verbal manipulation."
The author adds,
"My time with Claudine
already represented the realization of one of my fantasies; it seemed too
good to be true."
From Claudine to Stratfor's Modest Analyst
I might have dismissed such stories as mere spicy embellishment, but after
reading internal e-mails emanating from within the
Stratfor intelligence
firm, I'm not sure.
The e-mails, which were apparently stolen by hacking
group Anonymous, were later
disclosed by whistle-blowing outfit WikiLeaks.
The cache, which reportedly numbers a whopping 5 million e-mails, reveals
the inner workings of a company which provides confidential intelligence
services to large corporations but also key U.S. agencies such as,
Some of the e-mails are strikingly candid and provide insight into
Stratfor's slippery and underhanded psychological methods which are not so
far removed from what Perkins describes in his book.
Today, Washington is
not so focused on Ecuador as in Perkins' day but Venezuela, a pesky populist
ringleader of the left in Latin America.
Stratfor president
George Friedman,
who is interested in long-range geopolitical trends, requested that one of
his analysts, Rheba Bhalla, find out more about Hugo Chávez's state of
health and the larger political ramifications for Venezuela if the country's
firebrand president should falter.
Some of the Stratfor e-mails could have been lifted right out of a
sensationalistic scene from Confessions of an Economic Hit Man.
In one
e-mail exchange, Bhalla explains that the Venezuelan military had been "most
cooperative with us lately."
"These guys have been living the good life.
They love women... lots of women. They love booze. They love bora bora. They
are easy to bribe. They don't care about Chávez. They care about maintaining
their current lifestyles. We've seen a lot of these military elite reach out
to us lately, trying to insulate themselves in a post-Chávez scenario."
On
the other hand, Bhalla concedes that her contact, a "well-connected VZ
source working with Israel," isn't too reliable.
In terms of trust, her
source only rated a modest "B-," though,
"I've gotten better at reading him
over the years to tell when he's feeding me shit and when he's giving useful
info."
In something out of John Le Carré gobbledygook, Bhalla adds that her
"alpha" source required "special handling."
From Modest Analyst to John Le Carré
Friedman, who had just returned from Caracas, then expresses skepticism
about Bhalla's source. In a further riff on spook terminology, Friedman says
the source "could be valuable humint or pure rumint," but "we can't evaluate
accuracy."
Always the Godfather, Friedman adds,
"One of the reasons I want
you to execute missions is to learn how to evaluate sources. This is a very
difficult art but one you must learn. The gut is to be trusted only after
its well trained."
Defensive and eager to please, Bhalla writes back,
"Yes, I have much to learn
and I may be just an analyst, but I'm not 100% incapable of evaluating a
source I've known for a while."
Seeking to prove her meddle in the bizarre
psycho babble of Stratfor, Bhalla adds,
"I've listened to what you've told me
about reading a source (the Turk with the twitch.) I figured out what this
source's twitch is in reading his eyes. I've gotten much better in
evaluating what info to take more seriously and what info to disregard."
Perhaps, Bhalla had grown weary of being a mere analyst and, like Perkins,
yearned for more power. If that was the case, then it seems she finally got
her wish.
In a follow up exchange, Friedman explains over his blackberry
that it was time to,
"start our conversation on your next phase."
In the
event that a given source was deemed to have value, Friedman writes,
"You
have to take control of him. Control means financial, sexual or
psychological control to the point where he would reveal his sourcing and be
tasked."
Further indulging his penchant for spook speech, Friedman then declares that,
"The decision on approach would not come from you but from your handler.
This is because you're position is too close to the source and your judgment
by definition suspect.
Each meeting would be planned between you and your
handler and each meeting would have a specific goal not built around
discussing the topic of interest which would ideally be hidden but in
analyzing him personally and moving toward control."
Georgetown Alma Mater
Perhaps, Bhalla was gunning for more psychological "control" at her job all
along.
According to her online bio, she is a graduate of
Georgetown
University's Security Studies program of the School of Foreign Service, a
haven for spooks and intelligence folk. One associate professor, Elizabeth
Stanley, worked as a U.S. Army captain in military intelligence.
According
to the Georgetown web site, Stanley has experience in something called
"mindfulness techniques" and created,
"mindfulness-based Mind Fitness
Training (MMFT) to build warrior resilience and optimize individual and team
performance."
As the founder of the "Mind Fitness Training Institute,"
Stanley instructed soldiers as well as "organizations operating in
high-stress operational environments" in psychological methods.
On its web site, Georgetown proudly hocks its spook books which stress
unsavory methods such as "guile and theft" no less.
According to the blurb
for one book, Analyzing Intelligence,
"Decision makers matching wits with an
adversary want intelligence-good, relevant information to help them win.
Intelligence can gain these advantages through directed research and
analysis, agile collection, and the timely use of guile and theft.
Counterintelligence is the art and practice of defeating these endeavors.
Its purpose is the same as that of positive intelligence - to gain
advantage - but it does so by exploiting, disrupting, denying, or manipulating
the intelligence activities of others. The tools of counterintelligence
include security systems, deception, and disguise: vaults, mirrors, and
masks.
In one indispensable volume, top practitioners and scholars in the
field explain the importance of counterintelligence today and explore the
causes of-and practical solutions for-U.S. counterintelligence weaknesses."
The Georgetown program helps its students acquire employment at various
entities specializing in destabilization and intelligence work in Latin
America, including the CIA and FBI.
In addition, students may gain
employment at private corporations which have played a role in Venezuela
such
as SAIC or alternatively work for the public/private
International
Republican Institute linked to Senator John McCain [for more on both of
these outfits see my first book].
In opting for Stratfor, however, Friedman
analyst Bhalla seems to have done quite well for herself.
In a few short
years, the young woman became a sought after commentator on Latin America
and Venezuela, being featured in and cited by diverse media outlets
including CNN, National Public Radio, FOX News, The O'Reilly Factor and The
New York Times no less.
From Cable Gate to Global Intelligence Gate
Though surely bizarre, Friedman's talk about psychological control over
sources shouldn't come as any great surprise.
Whether it is individuals
acting from within the U.S. government or outside, such techniques have been
widely embraced. Indeed, if anything the Stratfor cables echo many of the
revelations stemming from earlier WikiLeaks disclosures.
To be sure, U.S.
diplomats are not instructed to sleep with their sources, but many of them
display the very same curious interest in domination and control.
Within the State Department, for example, staff personnel from the very top
down express interest in psychological profiles.
As I wrote in this piece
dating from 2010, U.S. officials went on a tear trying to get as much dirt
as possible about Argentina's power couple, Néstor and Cristina Fernández de
Kirchner.
Prior to Néstor's recent death, Secretary of State
Clinton
personally wrote to the American Embassy in Buenos Aires, remarking that the
U.S. was drawing up,
"a written product examining the interpersonal dynamics
between the governing tandem."
Clinton added that State had a pretty "solid understanding" of Néstor's
style and personality, but Cristina remained a mystery.
Specifically,
Clinton wanted to know how Cristina, an Hugo Chávez ally in the wider
region, managed "her nerves and anxiety." Somewhat bizarrely, Clinton then
asked her subordinates whether Cristina was taking any medications.
Again
and again, the Secretary of State pressed for details about Cristina's
psychological and emotional profile.
Other revelations stemming from the so-called "Cable Gate" scandal further
underscore the State Department's peculiar penchant for psychological
manipulation in Latin America.
Take for example U.S. ambassador in
Tegucigalpa Charles Ford, who held Honduran president and Hugo Chávez
protégé Manuel Zelaya in low regard.
In one cable disclosed by WikiLeaks,
Ford remarks almost casually,
"Always suspicious of American intentions, he
[Zelaya] inexplicably submitted to a psychological profile at my Residence
- twice."
There's got to be more to this story.
Are we to believe that Zelaya would simply show up at Ford's house and take a psychological test?
Why would this have occurred to Zelaya in the first place? What kind of test
was it? Interestingly enough, just like Clinton, Ford was very interested in
personal medical matters.
At one point, he wrote,
"Zelaya almost assuredly
takes strong medication for a severe back problem and perhaps other drugs as
well."
Though Stratfor's methods are extreme,
the WikiLeaks cables reveal that
psychological control is very much on the minds of official U.S.
policymakers as well.
Will further
WikiLeaks disclosures embarrass and shame Stratfor employees, prompting them to come clean and abandon their unsavory
work? The track record is hardly encouraging. In the wake of the earlier
Cable Gate scandal, not a single U.S. diplomat operating in Latin America
came clean to the public and the media about their role throughout the wider
region.
Perhaps, such officials were afraid of losing their jobs, or
alternatively saw nothing wrong in what they were doing.
Whatever the case,
it suggests that brave figures such as John Perkins are in the minority...
