The Freemasons have often been called satanic, which is something that they
are very capable of fending off.
While its rank and file members are ignorant of
the purpose of the organization, some know. Freemasons deflect accusations
of being a satanic society largely by employing the cover of being a
philanthropic organization. But what is at the core of the Freemasons'
beliefs? It is the belief in a single architect of the universe.
Freemasonry is based upon the legend of the building of Solomon's Temple,
which is said to have employed thousands of masons and stonecutters almost
3,000 years ago.
For many reasons, we cannot verify Masonic history too easily. Some
Attas
have investigated Freemasonry, both from within by infiltration and from
without by investigation. Thomas Paine is one of the Attas who undertook the
task from without, while other Attas like Benjamin Franklin and
Mark Twain infiltrated the organization.
Franklin disclosed many of the secrets of
Freemasonry to Thomas Paine and also provided him with copies of various
records from some lodges.
For this, Franklin was singled out for express
criticism by
Illuminati founder and high-ranking
Freemason and contemporary
Adam Weisshaupt, who is legendary for
his devious and twisted behavior and character. It was Weisshaupt who
supposedly founded the New World Order. However, he was more of a shill for
the ruling elite and did as he was directed.
After thoroughly investigating the organization, Paine argued well that
Freemason historians either will not produce the facts, or they do not know
them. To show the enormous corruption by Freemason historians, Paine noted
that according to Masonic history, Pythagoras of 580 B.C. was
supposed to be an early initiate of a frontrunner sodality of the
Freemasons.
However, according to their history, the society
was fully established during the time of the building of King Solomon's
Temple, which was completed more than 300 years before Pythagoras was born.
Pythagoras is one of the Attas. Freemasons falsely claim that he was a
member of their society.
Also, according to Freemason history, the famous Greek mathematician,
Euclid, communicated his knowledge to Hiram Abiff, the Master Mason. Abiff
was the main decorator of the temple, which was built in the tenth century
B.C. Euclid was born more than 500 years after the completion of the temple,
making this an impossibility. Whether the history was intentionally muddled
is irrelevant, as Freemasons continue to present the misinformation today,
long after horrendous errors have been exposed.
Since its own history is corrupted beyond recognition and its historians
refuse to correct it, this discussion will attempt to explain some pertinent
Masonic legends and further explain the actual history. The reader should
ever consider why the Freemasons would lie about their history while
contemplating things Masonic.
According to their legend, two of the main characters are King Solomon and
Hiram, King of Tyre. These kings got together and decided to build a
fabulous temple. They then employed Hiram Abiff, a master craftsman of wide
renown, to adorn the temple and beautify it.
Abiff, according to what is presented to candidates for the third degree of
Masonry, was treated as an equal by the two kings. But that is questionable,
as is the indication that all the masons and stonecutters who were building
the temple were considered to be worthy and noble tradesmen.
According to Masonic legend, just before the completion of the temple, three
ruffians conspired to extract the secrets of a Master Mason from Abiff. They
were unable to extract the secrets by force, but ended up killing Abiff.
The ruffians hid the body in the temple, then carted it away and buried it.
When King Solomon was informed that Abiff was missing, he was furious and
took a role call of the craft, and found three were missing. These were the
three ruffians. The king blocked the harbors and roads and sent out search
parties. Finally, the three ruffians were found and brought before King
Solomon, to whom they confessed. Solomon ordered each of them to be executed
in vile, horrific ways, with terrible torture and severing of body parts.
Thereafter, King Solomon and King Hiram dug up his grave to look all over
him for a clue to the syllable. When none was found, they raised Abiff from
his grave and buried him near the temple, as close to the Holy of Holies as
tradition would allow.
However, in interpreting the Masonic history, some previously hidden aspects
of the legend need to be presented. King Solomon and King Hiram had each
acquired one syllable of a secret code "word". Abiff had the third syllable.
The two kings and Abiff were going to use the secret "word" to perform a
ritual in the Holy of Holies after the completion of the temple. (This
information is only available to a very small group of the very highest
level of the Freemasons' hierarchy.)
This is a very dark story - Solomon, who was a tyrant, wanted SOLE
possession of the "word". He hired three ruffians to extract the secret
syllable from Abiff, who was in the temple when the ruffians approached him.
One of the ruffians demanded the secret syllable from Abiff, who knew
something was very wrong because only Solomon and Hiram knew he possessed a
secret syllable.
Abiff was able to trick them into revealing
Solomon had sent them before he bolted and fled. The ruffians gave chase,
captured him, and then killed him. They then dragged the body off and buried
it far away from the temple. The ruffians then reported the incident to
Solomon, who immediately had them executed and dismembered.
The immediate killings of the ruffians were done
as punishment to them and also because it was necessary to silence them.
Since the ruffians killed Abiff before extracting the secret from him, the
syllable was lost. At the funeral, the two kings were truly upset because
they had lost the opportunity to use the power of the secret code. They
vowed to one day discover the lost word. Meanwhile, they substituted a word
that sounds like "mor-bon-zi" for the lost word.
Today, this substituted word is the Grand
Masonic "word" according to Masonic history. It is believed that Solomon and
Hiram passed on their two parts of the secret word to very trusted members
only, and that these knowing members likewise passed it on to other trusted
members. Today, the very few with this knowledge are very actively searching
for the lost syllable so they can utter the real three-part secret word, or
the actual lost "word".
Since mor-bon-zi is only a substitute secret word, all Masons are given it
and recognize it to this day. However, mor-bon-zi is very rarely spoken
except during initiations or on very special occasions, and then only in a
low breath. The password the Masons use in everyday matters is "tu-bal-cain."
Many extra degrees have been added to Freemasonry throughout the years. Adam
Weisshaupt contrived some "French" degrees then traveled to Scotland and
presented them as genuine French degrees of Masonry to Scottish Freemasons.
He then invented "Scottish" degrees and traveled to France and presented
the bogus Scottish degrees to French Freemasons as genuine Scottish
Freemason degrees.
It should be noted that present-day Freemasons claim in a higher degree that
they have found the lost "word" of God. This word is given to candidates for
the Holy Royal Arch.
That word is "jah-bul-on", which is believed to be:
-
"jah"
for the Hebrew god
Yahweh
-
"bul" for the ancient Canaanite fertility god
Baal and Devil
-
"on" for the Egyptian god of the
underworld called Osiris
This "word of god" presented as "jah-bul-on" is another Freemason Weisshaupt-like
deception to trick some candidates into thinking the search for the word is
concluded.
But, "jah-bul-on" is only another substituted word. The search
for the lost "word" secretly continues.
Who were these three people really? Why did they have the secret parts to
the secret "word"? Does the "word" really have power?
King Solomon, King Hiram and Abiff were secretly occultists. They tried to
hide this information, and to severely limit and discourage those who would
pursue occult matters. One such indication of this appears in the extant
Bible in a book attributed to Solomon.
He did not write the entire book, but
he did plagiarize this verse:
Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:
That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which
flattereth with her words.
Proverbs 7:4-5.
The church tries to give other interpretations, but what this really means
is that wisdom and understanding should be treasured, but occult knowledge
must be shunned, as it is dangerous. Many of the Proverbs make sense when
interpreting the "strange woman" to be the occult mysteries, which otherwise
seem to be non-sequiturs.
The Bible is replete with warnings to avoid stargazers, mediums, magicians,
wizards, witches, sorcerers, seers, fortune tellers and the like. This was
especially true during the reign of King Josiah of Israel. However, the
Bible also shows that the religious leaders understood the esoteric (occult)
power of sounds, letters, words, names, symbols, astrology, numbers etc.
One example of comprehension of the power of
sounds and names is when Abram's name was changed to Abraham by the Hebrew
God according to Genesis 17:5.
In fact, many religious leaders knowingly use occult powers whilst they keep
the flock ignorant and fearful of the secret knowledge. Solomon is legendary
for his supposed wisdom, however his work with the occult is more hidden.
King Solomon and King Hiram, along with Abiff, were practicing occultists,
but in the area of Dark arts. They were directed to build a huge temple that
was to be dedicated to the higher forces of the Dark side.
To gain maximum empowerment for the temple, much
suffering was necessary in the construction of it. This was accomplished by
blood sacrifice and enslavement of the stonecutters and masons who were
forced to build the temple and by imposing oppressive taxation. These and
other measures culminated in a revolt.
When completed, the temple was to contain a Holy of Holies, where the three
of them were to meet from time to time to conjure up the full power of
Darkness associated with
the Anunnaki Elite who were no longer on Earth.
This was to be done by ritually calling down the Dark power via the "word".
Once the temple (or any other object), specifically the Holy of Holies
within the temple, was charged, it would take on a life of its own. It has a
power of its own. However, the Holy of Holies was never charged in the way
it was anticipated because Abiff was murdered before the temple was
completed.
The three sounds given to Solomon, Hiram and Abiff respectively, form the
actual secret lost "word" that Freemasons are seeking. When these are uttered
in proper pitch, duration, order, timing and intensity the composite sound
can call upon power from the subtle level.
This particular formula has the ability to
summon the full power of Darkness.
This is no small power; it cannot be overstated how powerful it is. Anyone
who possesses the key to this power can virtually control the entire world
and hold any nation ransom. This is not a joking matter and one not to be
taken lightly. Imagine what would have happened if Solomon had possessed the
complete "word". This "word" is what Hitler was secretly searching for. In the
wrong hands, this "word" could be absolutely disastrous.
The Freemasons are all raised to the third degree with the story of Abiff
and the substitute word. This is because very few Masons know about the
actual two separate syllables, but those who know are actively searching for
the lost sound. They hope that some candidate will reveal it. They also hope
that some Master Mason will discover it. However, none of the vast majority
of Masons has any idea of this secret agenda. And, after nearly 3,000 years
of searching, the secret "word" of Abiff's is still unknown to them.
Adam Weisshaupt was an agent for some people who had learned King Solomon's
and King Hiram's syllables, and they directed him to start the
New World
Order in the hopes that it would assist in locating the lost syllable. Weisshaupt's controllers believed that if there were a single dictator of
the world, then all information about everyone and everything would be at
the disposal of the regime.
Sounds are very powerful vibrations/energies when used in a certain way with
knowledge.
For example, the death of Diana Spencer appears to have been
caused by physical agents. However, it was actually brought about by forces
embedded in the spoken word directed from the unseen level, which brought
about the physical manifestation of her death. People who are involved with
Dark forces can get themselves into very serious situations. This is why the
fabled "pure" heart comes out repeatedly in legends, telling of one who can
properly use occult powers.
I know Solomon's and Hiram's sounds or syllables. I also know Abiff's sound.
I know the entire lost "word". How I know this is irrelevant. Equally, whether
anyone believes my assertion or not, is irrelevant.
Even when I first mentally reviewed this sound I
could feel the tremendous Dark power of the "word". I also have the
counter-sound which I used to neutralize the Dark "word". Now, the complete,
dreadful Dark secret "word" that Freemasons seek to assemble has been
contained and neutralized.
Bear in mind that some Freemasons may know the first two sounds or syllables
of the "word". And now, others will know them. But, I will never disclose the
lost sound from the Anunnaki Elite to anyone because of the highly dangerous
nature of the Dark energy embedded in the "word" that could be "resurrected"
if it fell into the wrong hands - that is, ANYONE without a "pure" heart.
THIS SYLLABLE HAS NOT BEEN RECORDED, WRITTEN,
TRANSCRIBED OR IMPARTED TO ANYONE.
No search will discover it. In any event, I
already neutralized the entire "word" with the counter-sound. I released this
counter-sound of the Light in 2002 on a CD entitled Loving You because the
counter-sound can also be used to counter-act other energies that are
directed by Darkness.
I now disclose the two sounds.
Abiff's syllable has eluded those of Darkness
for 3,000 years, and they will not acquire it before this virtual reality
collapses.
As a cautionary warning, any attempt by anyone sending thoughts with any
EVIL INTENT to either attack this information or to abuse the disclosed
sounds will automatically be deflected and returned to the sender. The
sender with such evil intent will reap instant or delayed consequences of
his or her own actions.
Returning to the Masonic legend, it should be stated that the horrible
deaths the three ruffians suffered are now part of the obligation of Masons
in the first three degrees of Masonry. When a person is awarded a degree, he
must utter the obligation under penalty of suffering a like death if ever he
were to reveal the secrets of a Master Mason.
The candidates are told that the oaths and
penalties are only symbolic and would have no bearing in reality, which is
true if the Master Mason were to give away the secrets known to the general
members of the secret society. However, the information about the original
secret "word" is the secret information that those oaths are designed to
protect against any disclosure.
They are real oaths with real penalties.
The term "Freemasons" is very revealing. Solomon had slaves building the
temple. But some of the tradesmen were not slaves; they were free-masons.
Likewise, the term "Master Masons" has the same significance. Those of that
rank were the slave masters or the teachers.
Solomon was a king who was reputed to have had many wives and concubines. He
did not let women worship with men, nor join secret societies. Divine rite
of kingship, slavery, male dominance and polygamy are characteristic traits
of
the Anunnaki, and Solomon was a descendant of the Anunnaki Remnants from
Atlantis. That is how he acquired his position.
Reference to Solomon being a
descendant of Anunnaki should not be confused with having blood ties to
them. This refers to his consciousness, which incarnates over and over in
different biological bodies, regardless of biological connections.
Similarly, the King of Tyre and Abiff both had Anunnaki roots. The three of
them were familiar with occult knowledge and because of their dedication to
the occult arts, it was revealed to them that certain sounds have very
powerful properties. Each of them had been given a sound capable of bringing
down special powers of the highest and darkest realm.
This was done only after a lot of blood
sacrifices which proved their loyalty to Darkness. Through this process,
each of them had acquired one part of the three-part word. They were
impressed to build the temple, where there was to be a Holy of Holies, where
they were to perform the ritual of summoning the power of the "word". It was
important to have slaves build the temple, as the suffering of the slaves
added greatly to the potential of the secret sound. Moreover, as described
above, the executions demonstrate yet another Anunnaki trait.
Likewise, Freemasons also thrive on bloodlust as
seen by their sanctifying of the brutal, horrible, demonic killings of the
three ruffians.
Many, including Thomas Paine, have compared the practice of Freemasonry with
Christianity. Paine concluded that both worship the physical sun, although
it is disguised in Christianity to appear to be the worship of Jesus, whom
they call the Son of God. Darkness imitated the Divine Mother and the
"Twelve Sisters" by creating the Sun and the twelve signs of the Zodiac.
Christianity was not founded by Jesus. The work of the early christians and
the propaganda of Paul and those who hid themselves behind the name of Jesus
all contributed to the invention of a marvelous story which resulted in Jesus being known to this day as the founder of a religion that was never
his.
Similarly, Jesus is being falsely
associated with the Ascended Masters in the Theosophical teaching.Christianity only became orthodox when Emperor
Constantine and the church councils created creeds and canons at the Council
of Nicea in 325 A.D. With this human-made church law, the followers of
Christianity no longer abide by the teachings of Jesus, but instead
follow the dictates of the church.
In current Christianity, it appears that christians relish in the murder of
Jesus and are so taken in by it that they re-enact his brutal
crucifixion. Christians call the murdering day "Good Friday" which term they excuse away
with Easter Sunday and the supposed physical resurrection of Jesus. On a
regular basis, christians symbolically eat the body of Jesus in what
is euphemistically called the "Eucharist" where they also symbolically drink
the blood of Christ.
These gruesome symbolic acts are signs of
cannibalism and vampirism. These horrible acts are falsely presented at
least four times in the extant Bible to give the church and its followers
apparent authority and authenticity to practice the repulsive rites.
Nearly all christian churches display crosses to remind followers of the
horrible murder of Jesus. Many of the crosses bear a male figure nailed onto
them to represent Jesus, who is graphically displayed in a gory and
agonizing depiction of his murder on a cross.
This depiction is grotesquely
objectionable to any thinking, feeling beings.
-
Can you see the similarity between Christianity and Freemasonry?
-
What kind
of a "god" would thirst for blood?
-
What kind of a "god" would want gruesome
murders re-lived over and over in the human psyche?
With regard to christians - it is far worse than
for the Masons.
According to many Freemasons, Abiff supposedly represents
Jesus - who incidentally had not yet been born when Solomon was in power.
But, Christianity symbolically does those dreadful things to the one they
claim to believe is the son of the God of light.
So there you have it - Yes, it appears quite clearly that Freemasons,
however unwittingly, are devil worshippers. Similarly, christians, however
unwittingly, are also worshipping Satan.
Darkness has always coveted that of the Light; it also corrupts that of the
Light whenever possible, as can be seen in christianity.
The one that is known as Saint Germaine, a significant character in
Masonic history, was accredited with the concept of the Violet/Amethyst
Flame. He was also known as Master Rakoczi, who was involved in
ritual and ceremony and who was incorrectly attributed to being the
re-incarnations of Merlin of Camelot and Lao Tse, the great Chinese mystic.
Merlin and Lao Tse are Attas of the Light.
Germaine was a descendent of
Anunnaki Remnants.
Germaine was also supposedly Roger Bacon (13th century) and Francis Bacon
(16th - 17th century), who was a Freemason.
Germaine's last incarnation was supposed to be
Francis Bacon, who was a
statesman, English philosopher, editor of the King James Version of the
extant Bible, and an occultist. Bacon was thoroughly discredited as a
scoundrel for abusing power and taking bribes. Francis Bacon is also known
as an Ascended Master of the
Great White Brotherhood in Theosophical/New Age
circles.
He was supposedly the high priest of the
Violet-Flame Temple which is associated with the seventh ray in "the
Theosophical Universe".
In fact, the concept of the Violet Flame was stolen from the "Twelve
Sisters" of the Divine Mother. As I have mentioned elsewhere, the "Twelve
Sisters" label does not necessarily reveal their respective genders.
The violet color is one of the distinct colors
of the Divine Mother and she extended it to the "Twelve Sisters" with the
power of true transmutation. Evil coveted this power of transmutation, and
attempted to simulate it as Evil often does, stealing
designs/concepts/ideas/patterns etc. from the Light, then corrupting them
and claiming them as Its own.
With regard to transmutation, it needs to be mentioned that the energy in
the physical realm is trapped within Matter. This energy is very different
from the energy of the True Divine Creation.
An analogy can be drawn by considering the micro level in this realm, where
electrons could be compared to being drivers of energy, not the masters of
energy as some have speculated. Protons and neutrons act as trapping agents
- they trap electrons and force them to work for the protons and neutrons.
The Demiurge usurped this sector of the True Divine Creation and later
created a world of virtual reality. This realm is an illusion, a virtual
reality. However, in this illusion a great deal of abuse is done to
True-Light beings.
The Demiurge created Matter and then gravity, which is the first cause in
setting Matter into motion. Next, It created heat and cold, both of which
can cause pseudo transmutation of Matter, and whose properties can also trap
electrons. The electrons are akin to trapped Light beings in this dimension.
Gravity sustains physical motion. Many have theorized that because gravity
is a weaker force than some other forces, that it is not the primary force.
This is erroneous. Gravity is the first cause and the critical force that
holds this illusory universe together. Only later did the Demiurge create
the strong and weak nuclear forces to better tighten and bond matter
together, and later still, It created the electromagnetic force to seal off
sections of the Evil Creation and to erase memories of beings in the virtual
reality.
The physical universe is continually spinning
but going nowhere. For example, there is the perceived rotation of the ages
- the signs of the Zodiac. They repeat the cycle over and over without real
progress.
That is the plan of the Demiurge.
Gravity is the first force of attraction. Motion is keeping the illusion
going by the sustaining properties of gravity. When gravity is dismantled,
the balls will stop moving, and the entire illusion will crumble. There are
particular energies which build virtual realities within virtual realities
in this dimension.
The continuous motion works much like a sleight-of-hand trick. All the
beings in the realm are moving so much within the illusion that they cannot
focus on reality. As an example, imagine that you are riding on a
merry-go-round. The horse can feel like it is standing still and everything
around you is spinning. As a result, you cannot maintain focus on the
outside world, however it is relatively easy to focus on the horses on the
merry-go-round.
This is because you are within the illusion of
the merry-go-round and it becomes the reality of the moment. Try as you
might, you can only catch glimpses of the outside world which you perceive
to be spinning.
However, you know that you are spinning on the
merry-go-round, not the world outside, whose movement is an illusion created
by the merry-go-round.
Thus, because of all the motion in the universe, and motion within motion,
everything here is like a merry-go-round ride, and those on the ride can
only get an occasional glimpse here and there of what is beyond. And, even
then, those glimpses are often just of motions within motions, or other
merry-go-rounds. Merry-go-rounds can be fun for a short ride, but if you
stay on too long, they make you sick.
From a spiritual standpoint that sickness has so
disoriented True-Light beings that they have forgotten their True Divine
origin and think that they are part of the illusion. If the merry-go-round
stops, the illusion stops and all viable True-Light beings will be outside
the virtual reality.
The shattering of this illusion - this virtual reality - has commenced. Due
to the complexities of illusions within illusions it has taken a long time
to dismantle it. Gravity, because of motion and inertia, is the primary
cause holding things together for the time being. Once the virtual realities
within the virtual reality are all shattered, all the True beings of the
Light who are trapped here will be freed. This day will come. Everyone
should try to break the mindset that the physical is all there is because
that mindset is the biggest trap of all.
There is a True Reality out there, once these
dreadful rides stop.
One strong indication of the breaking of the illusion of the virtual reality
occurred recently. A dog enclosure was locked and the lock had frozen shut.
I needed to enter, but couldn't because of the frozen lock. I then pulled on
the lock several times, but was unable to unfreeze it. Then, I pulled again
and amazingly was able to pass the frozen-shut metal lock and my hand
through a two-layered galvanized steel latch! I actually passed both my hand
and the metal lock right through the steel hasp!
To do this defies the laws of physics in this
realm, yet it occurred. It was the equivalent of walking through a wall
while carrying a metal object with me.
While electrons are trapped by protons and neutrons on the atomic level,
planets are trapped by stars or suns on the macro level. The sun of our
solar system is the trap. It gives off False-Light, which the planets need
to survive in this material realm. In exchange for this light, the sun
forces the planets to revolve around it and to do all the work keeping the
solar system bound together in the illusion which is driven by their orbits
around the sun.
If the perpetual motion of the planets - the
merry-go-round - stops, the illusion crumbles, and all the viable True-Light
beings in the entire solar system are liberated from the entrapments of
Darkness.
Of course, the solar system is but a ride within a ride, as it is part of a
galaxy, which is part of the universe. All of these rides are about to stop
turning.
The sun is the main source of the illusion. Those who are part of the
illusion will dissipate when the illusion collapses. Those who are not part
of the illusion will continue to exist after the virtual reality is over.
While the sun is the biggest trap in the solar system, it has the appearance
of being of the greatest assistance and being the most important part of the
system. The sun is not the driver of the solar system, the planets are.
While the sun provides heat and light by which biological "life" is made
possible, biological life is but another virtual reality which traps the
True-Light beings.
Through being trapped in biological bodies,
True-Light beings are forced to drive the world.
In this realm, Light looks dark, and Darkness appears as light.
Much has been said of late about
the sun cruisers that have been
photographed near the sun. A great deal of speculation has occurred as to
what they are doing. They are crafts of the True Divine Creation which are
here to extinguish the sun. They have done this to many stars in the virtual
reality and freed many beings of Light from the grasp of Darkness by
shattering the illusion of solar systems and unlocking the prison doors.
Sun cruisers were responsible for the
extinguishment of the Anunnaki's home star
ZA-OS, which in turn freed many
beings of Light from the grasp of Darkness.
The Anunnaki were a very advanced race of beings and they had accomplished
space travel before their star was extinguished. Being advanced
technologically allowed the Anunnaki to spread their tentacles throughout
the physical world as the main agents of the Demiurge. They are, in effect,
angels of Darkness. They have been programmed to be as evil as the Demiurge,
as ruthless, as brutal, as chauvinistic, and as hopelessly putrid as their
"father".
The Anunnaki were given certain powers to assist the Demiurge in keeping the
illusion going for as long as possible.
The Demiurge knows that its days are
numbered, but it has extended those days by employing the dreadful Anunnaki,
who are sent to various systems with the ability to restart "time" in the
systems, that is to travel into the past so the virtual reality can be
re-lived over and over again.
These Anunnaki came to Earth and set up control here. They are literally
from the past, as they have re-started the system before. They hope to
re-start it again so they can enslave all the beings of Light for another
ride on the merry-go-round, and force them to drive the pointless
counterfeit creation here. The Anunnaki know that they must re-start
everything before
2012 A.D. because that is the date which they have set for
restarting the clock.
While things were going along for the Anunnaki and they were doing their
"father's" bidding on Earth, the Attas of Light became very active, which
was most troubling to the Anunnaki.
All major religions in this world are sponsored by the Anunnaki.
Religion is
an extremely effective tool for keeping control of the people. A fundamental
aspect of all these religions is that the central figure of worship is the
sun, whether they called their sun god Ra, Apollo, Helios etc. This was true
in ancient Greek, Egyptian, Sumerian, Babylonian, Roman, English, Mayan, and
Incan cultures, etc.
Sun worship is the basis for major religions today, even if it has been
corrupted or its foundation has been obscured or lost. For instance, Jews
have their ancient temples constructed to honor the sun and the Zodiac.
Most notable of these temples dedicated to sun worship would be Solomon's
Temple, which was standing during the entire reign of
Josiah. Josiah is
remembered by Bible students for knocking down idols dedicated to worship of
the sun and other gods formerly of the Jewish pantheon. Josiah claimed to be
following the Laws of Moses.
Yet Solomon's Temple, which was built long after
the death of Moses and violated many of those laws, was left untouched.
Either the laws of Moses were tampered with after the Temple was built to
allow it to stand, or Solomon's Temple was an abomination to the Jewish
faith. For whatever reasons, Josiah allowed the temple in Jerusalem to
remain despite its obvious construction and dedication to sun worship.
One characteristic of sun worship is that everything hinges on the
resurrection of the rising sun. The sun gives warmth and life according to
their beliefs. That is why there are so many legends of dying/rising gods.
Candidates for the third degree of Freemasonry play the part of Hiram Abiff
in a drama. The candidate, like Abiff, is raised from the grave, symbolizing
the dying/rising god legends.
Christians honor Jesus, the son of God, who takes the place of the
physical sun. Even the name EAST-er SUN-day for Christianity gives away its
basis. Thomas Paine noted that:
[T]he christian religion is a parody on the worship of the Sun, in which
they put a man whom they call Christ, in the place of the Sun, and pay him
the same adoration which was originally paid to the Sun.
It should be stressed here that the Magi of Persia were also sun worshipers,
which demonstrates that the invention of the story about the visit of the
three Magi at the birth of Jesus was added to the account contained in the
New Testament. This addition happened sometime after
Constantine made
christianity orthodox and included sun worship in the christian religion.
In Celtic tradition, the direction east is also very significant. Druids
worshipped the sun; Native Americans place great significance on sun dances;
Eastern religions highly respect the sun. Often, emperors were compared to
the rising sun in ancient days of the Eastern world.
Freemasons construct their lodges east and west and the Worshipful Master of
the lodge stands in the east because, according to Masonic teachings, as the
sun rises in the east, so should the Master stand in the east. Freemasons
make advancement in degrees by seeking more light in Masonry. This is not to
be confused with divine light.
Masonic teachings state that there are two
lights. These lights are referred to as the greater and the lesser lights.
The sun is the greater light, while the moon is the lesser.
In Grand Master George Smith's
The Use and Abuse of Free-Masonry is found:
The emblematical meaning of the Sun is well
known to the enlightened and inquisitive Free-Mason; and as the real Sun
is situated in the centre of the universe, so the emblematical Sun is
the centre of real Masonry.
We all know that the Sun is the fountain of
light, the source of the seasons, the cause of the vicissitudes of day
and night, the parent of vegetation, the friend of man; hence the
scientific Free-Mason only knows the reason why the Sun is placed in the
centre of this beautiful hall.
The Anunnaki have planted sun worship throughout
the world.
They have forced construction of structures to
pay homage to the sun, such as Stonehenge, where the altar stone faces the
rising sun. Even though Stonehenge was also used as an observatory and had
other purposes, sun worship was its main purpose. The Anunnaki know that the
sun must keep burning or the illusion of the solar system will shatter.
That is the main objective of Anunnaki
occupation of worlds - to keep the stars burning.
The Anunnaki Elite were given a particular sound by the Demiurge which
allowed them to control and re-start "time" within solar systems. It is like
the key to a huge time machine. It allows the Anunnaki to turn back the
clock, so to speak, and gain a temporary reprieve from the Celestial
Correction by the Light.
The Demiurge's sound was removed from the Earth by the Anunnaki Elite when
they fled after destroying
Atlantis. They took the "word" with them. The Attas
of the Light have since blocked the Anunnaki Elite from returning to Earth.
However, some of the Anunnaki Elite slipped
through the net temporarily and approached near enough to the Earth during
the time of Solomon to transmit the sound to three chosen Anunnaki Remnants
who were on Earth - King Solomon, King Hiram and Abiff, the Master Mason.
The Anunnaki Elite did this desperate thing in the hope that the Anunnaki
Remnants would be able to help them return and re-take control of the Earth.
This "word" is the powerhouse of the Demiurge. The "word" has the power to keep
this realm in motion and keep the illusion afloat. Except for the
intervention by the Amoebas/Attas of the Light, the "word" would continue to
have this power. The following is worthy of reflection regarding the "word"
and the "god" being written about in the verse.
In the beginning was the "word", and the
"word" was with God, and the "word" was God.
The first two syllables of the "word" given to King Solomon and King Hiram
respectively are like the building blocks. They cannot do anything in and of
themselves without the third and final syllable. Thus, the first two
syllables are like drones without the "spirit" of the third syllable. The
final syllable acts like the life force which drives the "word" of the
Demiurge.
The third syllable was given to Abiff because
the Anunnaki Elite saw him as the most pious (devoted and loyal to the
Anunnaki Elite), hence he was seen as the most trustworthy of the
instruments. That is why the two kings were unable to bring the FULL power
of the Demiurge to the Earth. So, they commenced a frantic search, quizzing
all workmen and slaves who were a part of building the temple, hoping that
Abiff may have given the syllable to one of them.
This search proved fruitless.
Since then, the search continues for the lost "word". This search continues in
many forms, with most of the searchers totally oblivious to what they are
really searching for or why. Even today, many still seek the Ark of the
Covenant and the Holy Grail. Many stories were created to hide the true
purpose of the ventures. There is always an attachment of some sort of
spiritual quest in the scouring of the land for the "word". The Crusades were
part of this quest.
The Ark of the Covenant possessed famed
properties. It was in reality a "radio" transceiver that was used by the
priests to send and receive information directly to and from their "gods"
(the Anunnaki Elite) in the spacecrafts.
These searches are all instigated and sponsored by the Anunnaki Remnants,
who have first inspection rights to all finds. This is a mandatory condition
of all Anunnaki Remnant funded projects designed to search for the lost
"word", which searches are carried out under many disguises. These searches
attract many who are sincerely searching for Truth, Love, Light and Purity.
However, many of those with admirable intentions
are being fooled by the Anunnaki Remnants. The sincere seekers have no
suspicion whatsoever as to the origin or agendas of the plot.
Different groups of Anunnaki Remnants are still searching for the "word",
performing their search in different ways and whilst the majority of the
people do not suspect this agenda, most would scoff at it. Some people can
now see or sense the Anunnaki faces behind their human disguises (whether
the faces are
Reptilian,
Vulturite,
Masa-karas, and even
Olcars who are the
highest Reptilians etc).
As the virtual reality collapses more and more, so
too will more and more people become aware of the Anunnaki around them.
A recent example of this desperate search by one group of the Anunnaki
Remnants for the lost "word" occurred when Iraq was invaded in 2003. The cover
story for this invasion was to rid the world of that country's storehouse of
weapons of mass destruction. The most informed leaders of the invading
forces knew there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
The apparent reason for the invasion was for
control of the oil fields in the country, which is what the ruling elite
want those who see through the façade of the main cover story to think -
that is that it was done for greed, oil and money.
However, the real reason for the invasion of Iraq was to perform an intense
search of the country for clues to the lost "word". This shows how wide,
intense and desperate the search is for the "word". This is because the
"word"
has the power to change the destiny for the Anunnaki Elite. It could open
the gates to bring them back on Earth for yet another reign of terror.
During World War II, Hitler, the Führer and active occultist was sponsored
by a particular group of Anunnaki Remnants to actively search for the lost
"word". Many thought he was after the Ark of the Covenant, but that was not
the case. He was after the "word". This is one of the reasons why when Hitler
turned his attention to the Middle East, the Western powers vastly increased
their efforts to halt his war machine.
The New World Order employs agents to spread disinformation and
misinformation to the masses. It also tries to frighten the masses into
compliance. One of its most effective tools of recent has been to implement
artificial catastrophes so that draconian laws can be enacted to fight
the
artificial war on terrorism. This is a contrived war that got out of hand
and now there are some real terrorists causing "unplanned" damages.
Likewise, the New World Order also creates false prophets who predict things
that will never transpire. These false prophets are hired to predict these
non-events in order to discredit true prophets so that when the real Message
is given, most people will not take it seriously.
A recent example of this was a very elaborate conspiracy by the ruling elite
to frighten the people living in the western part of the United States by
falsely broadcasting misinformation that a large object was approaching
Earth and its approach would devastate that area. This misinformation had
reached the stage of being broadcast on the alternative media, which was to
be a springboard for sending the false story to the conventional media.
It was intended that this story would cause mass
panic and hysteria so that martial law could be enforced. However, this
devious plan was thwarted by the Attas of Light, and the plan has fizzled.
Yet, this is such an important plot for the New World Order that many are
still desperately attempting to resurrect it.
Some of the New World Order agents play roles to
appear to be scorning the false prophet, but in reality, they are conspiring
and working together to try to keep this devious plot alive. It will not
work. On the energy level, this failed attempt of the ruling elite is a
crushing defeat for Darkness.
The Freemasons are agents of the Reptilian Anunnaki Remnants, and form a
group that is "openly" secret and is very actively searching for the
"word".
Every Master Mason knows the story of Hiram Abiff and the three ruffians,
and they all know the substitute word that was given at Abiff's funeral.
Almost all of them are looking for this "word", but very few have any idea of
the reason behind it.
Freemasonry was originated by Darkness. Christianity was hijacked by
Darkness. Since Darkness thoroughly corrupted christianity, it is virtually
impossible to discern the difference between Freemasonry and Christianity.
There are many members of the royal families throughout the world who are
involved in the Freemason society, or branches thereof. These organizations
are widespread but theoretically nobody outside knows what goes on inside
the lodges.
Many of the ruling elite belong to these groups.
It should be stressed again, that many members of the organization have no
idea of the nefarious agendas of the highest echelon of the organization.
Many of them are innocent people caught in a spider's web, just like many
christians.
Many Light beings are attracted to various religions and esoteric groups
even though the organizations are sponsored by the Dark side. This is
because Darkness has deviously mixed Light teachings with untruth to lure
and fool the unaware True-Light beings who are attracted to the Truth that
is buried in the maze of untruth. Some of these mixtures are so complex and
well disguised that even highly advanced beings have difficulty sorting the
gems from the garbage.
Things are not always what they appear to be in this world of virtual
reality. Neither are the Freemasons what they appear to be, even to the
majority of their members.
Native American Hopis have a legend about "The Sign From the West" being the
forerunner of the end of Evil.
The Sign From the West is now in the physical
realm.
The Sign From the West bears the esoteric message to look to the West
instead of the East. As the rising sun symbolizes the heart of Evil, the
setting sun represents the end of Evil. It is time to abandon worship of the
sun - time to abandon Evil.
The Lakota Native Americans have a legend about the births of white buffalo
calves. When seven are born, the Teacher known as the White Buffalo Woman
will appear, which will signal the end of Evil and the return to Purity. The
seventh white buffalo was born, but not in a bison's body.
The White Buffalo Woman has returned to Earth,
not as the Teacher, but as the Liberator of True-Light beings trapped in
Darkness, whether they are in mineral, vegetable, animal, human or other
bodies and whether they are devas of rivers or seas, plains or mountains
etc. including even the "soul" of the Earth.
The Divine Mother and the White Buffalo Woman are all aspects of A-itu,
the Eternal Flame, the Divine Being of Purity. These aspects of A-itu are
now united on this plane in a physical "body" as a "walk-in".
The true God does not want to be worshipped. In fact, the desire to be
worshipped is yet another Anunnaki trait. The Anunnaki also build huge,
elaborate monuments and temples, but these are not for the true God. These
are human-made idols to satisfy human ego.
The Light has attempted repeatedly to correct Darkness and bring It back to
the Light, but Darkness stubbornly rejects any correction. Darkness has
tenaciously held onto every True-Light being that is trapped in the virtual
reality, and holds those beings ransom.
Now, the time has come for the Light
to liberate Its Own from Darkness.
The process has commenced.
