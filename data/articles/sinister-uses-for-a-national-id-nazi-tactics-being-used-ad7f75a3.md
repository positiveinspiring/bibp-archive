Sinister use for a National ID Card
Nazi
Tactics being used to track Illegal aliens
It appears that the idea may have
originally had limited purposes, but that it opens the door for expansion
into the creation of an ID card for other entities also, so that eventually
all entities may be required to have ID cards. This Awareness indicates of
course, this becomes similar to that which occurred in Nazi Germany, wherein
everyone needed to be identified or to have identification papers with them,
which then makes it impossible for entities to have any sense of true freedom.
This Awareness indicates that it
helps the law enforcement society to be able to know exactly who an entity
is, and the argument can be set forth that if you have nothing to hide, what
does it matter if they know who you are or not? This Awareness indicates that
the only thing that might matter in such a case is if they decide that they
want to rid the country of all Jews, or all Christians, or all Anglo-Saxons,
or all people earning a minimum wage, or all people over a certain age, they
have the ability to do so by checking the ID cards of individuals and learning
all they want to know about such entities.
From ID card to a chip in the hand
It also conditions the entities to
move from an ID card to a chip in the hand
without thinking of it as such a great difference. This Awareness indicates
that the more control you give to the government over you as a citizen, the
less control you as a citizen have. This Awareness indicates that instead
of entities being willing to give up more and more control to the government,
it should be the other way around. It should be that the citizen, the people,
put more and more controls on the government, for the people are the real
government, and those who work for the government in this country are supposed
to be working for the people.
This Awareness indicates that this
is the idea situation, and when the New World Order embraces this kind of
concept for all governments of the world, it will be an ideal concept to have
a New World Order in which the bureaucracy works in behalf of, and for the
people of the world.
The Role
of "Civil Servants" needs redefining
This Awareness indicates that the
term of civil servant as that which has been around for many decades, but
the concept is that which hardly exists in reality. The civil servant generally
thinks of himself as a bureaucratic demi-god. He has his little power seat,
and the people come in to see him regarding something, and he immediately
lets them know he is boss, and they are to take a number and wait until he
is ready.
This Awareness indicates that this
concept of the civil servant needs to be re-defined according to its original
meaning, and need to be re-applied to the bureaucratic demi-gods so that it
covers their demi-god status and they are reminded that they are the civil
servants and they are there to help, and they are paid by the people who are
their bosses, who are their employers, and when this begins to happen and
entities begin to realize they are indeed civil servants of others, to realize
they are to serve the masses, then the government will take on a new appearance
and the people will begin to recognize their own empowerment and the value
of the Constitution and the law of the land as having been something quite
special, that needs to be preserved.
This Awareness indicates that as
entities begin to think of these government officials as civil servants rather
than cringe when they come close to one, they will begin to give a different
air or aura upon meeting with a civil servant so that they are no longer frightened
of them. Why be frightened of a civil servant?
This Awareness indicates however,
the idea has been switched around so that entities being called in to see
an official are always terrified or nervous or frightened in some way that
the so-called civil servant will extract money from them or put them in a
position inferior to where they are now, or will deny them something they
need and are entitled to.
This Awareness wishes entities to
stop thinking so much of the bureaucrats as official authorities and think
of them more as civil servants, and remind them, if necessary, who pays their
salaries. Remind them that you can petition your fellow citizens to have them
removed from office if they cannot fulfill their civil duties. This Awareness
indicates that it is important of course to be respectful and fair in your
dealings with civil servants, particularly those who who recognize their job
is to serve you and your fellow citizens.
(Remember, You're the Boss. They Work for
You)
