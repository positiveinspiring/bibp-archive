After half-a-year of delays and roadblocks, the
U.S. Secret Service today released the first 104 pages of agency documents
about the late coder and activist
Aaron Swartz, including a brief report on
Swartzs suicide less than three months before his scheduled trial.
On 1/11/13, Aaron Swartz was found dead in his
apartment in Brooklyn, as a result of an apparent suicide, reads a January
17, 2013 Secret Service memo.
A suppression hearing in this had been
scheduled for 1/25/13 with a trial date of 4/1/13, in U.S. District Court of
the District of Massachusetts.
In January 2011, Swartz was caught using MITs
public network to bulk-download 4 million academic articles from the JSTOR
archive.
MIT had a subscription to the archive that made it free to use from
MITs campus. The Secret Service was brought into the case early on, and
federal prosecutors ultimately charged Swartz with wire fraud and computer
hacking.
The heavily redacted documents released today
confirm earlier reports that
the Secret Service was interested in a Guerilla Open Access Manifesto
that Swartz and others had penned in 2008.
In May 2011, a Secret Service
agent and a detective from the Cambridge police department interviewed a
friend of Swartz and inquired specifically about the political statement.
The friend noted that Swartz and his coauthors,
believe that the open access
movement is a human rights issue.
The Secret Service documents also describe the
February 11, 2011 search on Swartzs home in Cambridge that came over a
month after Swartz was first arrested and released by local police.
Swartz
was home at the time the search was executed, reads one report. While the
search was conducted, Swartz made statements to the effect of, what took you
so long, and why didnt you do this earlier?
The documents were released through my ongoing
Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Department of Homeland
Security, the Secret Services parent agency.
I am the plaintiff in the lawsuit
In February, the Secret Service
denied in full my request for any files it held on Swartz.
When the
agency failed to respond to my administrative appeal, I recruited DC-based
attorney David Sobel, and we filed suit.
Last month U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ordered the government to begin releasing the Swartz files on
a rolling basis, but then stayed that order to hear arguments from MIT and
JSTOR, who are
seeking advance review of any documents released (my lawyer is now
talking to their lawyers.)
Last week Kollar-Kotelly directed the
government to promptly release the
104 pages that have already been reviewed, and which do not reference
MIT or JSTOR employees.
The government says its
identified 14,500 pages of documents for release on a rolling basis. It
estimates it will take six months to process them.

I knew Swartz and worked with him on a
project.

Aaron Swartzs Political Manifesto
...Against Him

The prosecution of Aaron Swartz was motivated,
in part, by the 2008 Guerilla Open Access Manifesto the internet activist
had penned advocating for civil disobedience against copyright law, Swartzs
attorney confirmed Friday.
The revelation underscores that the
hacking charges against the former director of
Demand Progress were bolstered by
the 26-year-olds philosophy of a world unhindered by copyright law, a world
in which he said it was a moral imperative to unshackle the privatization
of knowledge.
The Huffington Post
first revealed the matter Friday, citing anonymous sources familiar with
a closed-door briefing between the Justice Department and members and staff
of the House Oversight Committee.
Swartz,
who had also written about his own depression, was found dead at his
Brooklyn apartment last month after committing suicide.
He was
under indictment (.pdf) in Massachusetts for more than a dozen counts of
computer hacking and wire fraud in connection to the downloading of millions
of academic articles from a subscription database at MIT. An internet
sensation who helped develop the Creative Commons and was part of a small
team that sold Reddit to Wired parent company Condé Nast, Swartz had
apparently planned to release to the public the millions of JSTOR academic
papers he downloaded.
His attorney, Elliot Peters, said prosecutors
were very focused on the manifesto Swartz penned from Italy.
They were very focused on it, and appeared to
be planning to use it as evidence of Aarons intent to take the JSTOR
material and somehow post it online to make it available for all, Peters
told Wired on Friday.
They had spent a lot of energy investigating that
document - who wrote it, whether it conveyed Aarons point of view, etc.
The government, Peters said,
had also
subpoenaed various versions of the document from the Internet Archive,
Peters said.
Here is Swartzs manifesto:
Guerilla Open Access Manifesto

Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to
keep it for themselves.
The worlds entire scientific and cultural
heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is
increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private
corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results
of the sciences? Youll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like
Reed Elsevier.
There are those struggling to change this.
The
Open Access Movement has fought
valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away
but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms
that allow anyone to access it.
But even under the best scenarios, their
work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up
until now will have been lost.
That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read
the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only
allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles
to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children
in the Global South?
Its outrageous and unacceptable.
I agree, many say, but what can we
do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of
money by charging for access, and its perfectly legal - theres
nothing we can do to stop them.
But there is something we can, something
thats already being done: we can fight back.
Those with access to these resources - students, librarians, scientists
- you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of
knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out.
But you need not -
indeed, morally, you cannot - keep this privilege for yourselves. You
have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords
with colleagues, filling download requests for friends.
Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You
have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating
the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your
friends.
But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. Its
called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the
moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew.
But
sharing isnt immoral - its a moral imperative. Only those blinded by
greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.
Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under
which they operate require it - their shareholders would revolt at
anything less. And the politicians they have bought off back them,
passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make
copies.
There is no justice in following unjust laws. Its time to come into the
light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our
opposition to this private theft of public culture.
We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and
share them with the world. We need to take stuff thats out of copyright
and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them
on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to
file sharing networks.
We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.
With enough of us, around the world, well not just send a strong
message opposing the privatization of knowledge - well make it a thing
of the past.
Will you join us?
Aaron Swartz
July 2008, Eremo, Italy
U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, who has come
under fire for the Swartz prosecution on accusations she abused computer
hacking laws, offered Swartz a six-month plea deal in the weeks before
Swartzs death. Swartz refused the offer.
Prosecutors did not immediately respond for
comment.
The prosecution, in part, tested the reach of
the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which was
passed in 1984 to enhance the governments ability to prosecute hackers who
accessed computers to steal information or to disrupt or destroy computer
functionality.
The government, however, has interpreted the
anti-hacking provisions to include activities such as violating a websites
terms of service or a companys computer usage policy.
The indictment accused Swartz of repeatedly
spoofing the MAC address - an identifier that is usually static - of his
computer after MIT blocked his computer based on that number. The grand jury
indictment also notes that Swartz didnt provide a real e-mail address when
registering on the network. Swartz also allegedly sneaked an Acer laptop
bought just for the downloading into a closet at MIT in order to get a
persistent connection to the network.
Swartz hid his face from surveillance cameras by
holding his bike helmet up to his face and looking through the ventilation
holes when going in to swap out an external drive used to store the
documents, according to the indictment.
Swartz is no stranger to the feds being
interested in his skills at prodigious downloads.
In 2008, the federal court system decided to try
out allowing free public access to its court record
search system PACER at
17 libraries across the country. Swartz went to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals library in Chicago and installed a small PERL script he had
written.
The code cycled sequentially through case numbers, requesting a new
document from PACER every three seconds. In this manner, Swartz got nearly
20 million pages of court documents, which his script uploaded to Amazons
EC2 cloud computing service.
While the documents are in the public record and
free to share, PACER normally charges 10 cents per page.
Swartz was not
prosecuted for the PACER activities.
