The "CITY" of London
The "City", also known as the "square mile" an area of 677
hectares in London is just like the Vatican City in Rome their
own state.
The City-State, pays no tax, has its own courts, its
own laws, their own flag, their own private police at about
2,000 men, and a night population that underestimates 9000
inhabitants.
Here are the Bank of England, a privately owned institution
which is not subject to regulation by the British Parliament,
and in fact is a sovereign world power.
Moreover, Lloyds of
London (insurance), London Stock Exchange (stock exchange) Fleet
Streets newspapers and publishing, offices in all British banks,
offices in 385 foreign banks, and 70 U.S. banks.
Internationally they use the "Crown Princess" as a symbol of
power but the real power belongs to the bankers and not
the
royal house.
It is very difficult to gain an insight into the
persons who effectively control the Bank of England. A name that
leaked is
Rothschild.
The "City of London" is an economic entity which is legally
separate from England and in control of all lawyers and banks
across the world - including the
Federal Reserve
in the USA!
The
"City" is also the English seat of the world's
Freemasonry with
the United Grand Lodge of England as the center...
Washington, District of Columbia
The flag of the
Washington District of Columbia has three red
stars. One for each city state in the empire.
This empire rule
the world economically through London's "City", militarily by
the District of Columbia, and spiritually by the Vatican.
The
Constitution for the District of Columbia operates under a
tyrannical Roman law known as the
lex fori and has no
similarities to the U.S. Constitution...
The Vatican in Rome
Vatican's assets include massive investments
by Rothschild in
the UK, France and the U.S., billions of shares in oil and
weapons companies like,
-
Shell
-
General Electric
-
Bethlehem
Steel
The Vatican is the world's largest owner of private
property and its gold reserves are stored by the Bank of England
and the U.S.
Federal Reserve Bank...
