Empire examines the symbiotic relationship between the movie industry and
the military-industrial complex.
War is hell, but for Hollywood it has been a Godsend, providing the perfect
dramatic setting against which courageous heroes win the hearts and minds of
the movie going public.
The Pentagon recognizes the power of these celluloid dreams and encourages
Hollywood to create heroic myths; to rewrite history to suit its own
strategy and as a recruiting tool to provide a steady flow of willing young
patriots for its wars.
What does Hollywood get out of this deal with the devil?
Access to
billions of dollars worth of military kit, from helicopters to aircraft
carriers, enabling filmmakers to make bigger and more spectacular battle
scenes, which in turn generate more box office revenue. Providing they
accept the Pentagons advice, even toe the party line and show the US
military in a positive light.
So is it a case of art imitating life, or a sinister force using art to
influence life and death - and the public perception of both?
Empire will
examine Hollywood, the Pentagon, and war.
