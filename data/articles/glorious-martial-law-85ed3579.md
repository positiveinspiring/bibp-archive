-
Are we allowed to talk about martial
law, the militarization of police, and the complete shutdown of
cities on command?
-
Or will that get the glorious law
enforcers to storm and kick in our own doors now?
-
Just what are the rules in effect
today?
-
Just what sort of precedent is being set
here right before our eyes?
It was your commoner citizens who located the
Boston bombing suspect after finding him hiding in a boat. This was after
the martial law decree had arbitrarily been lifted, and it was now ordered
permissible to go out in ones backyard again.
Is martial law the answer to sticky incidents
with fleeing suspects? Can this now apply to any suspects or any manhunt in
the United States, anywhere, for any reason?
One might argue that clearing the streets under
military decree is very useful for a particular purpose when pursuing a
suspect:
allowing a "free fire zone" of automatic
.40 caliber hollow point gunfire, the known preference of the new
"Homeland Security" apparatus.
So what precedents are we setting now, in terms
of rewriting the entire law enforcement paradigm, arguably a much more
serious concern than a single 19 year old bleeding suspect.
Yeah. What the hell actually happened last week
in Boston?
"Governor Deval Patrick took an
unprecedented security step, 'asking' people in Boston, Watertown, and
several other nearby communities - totaling a million people - to "shelter in place"
- stay at home behind locked doors and open up only to police officers
with proper identification."
Boston
Globe
"Asking?"... Martial law is just a friendly request, and the
Globe dutifully disseminates.
CBS News counts,
"thousands of heavily armed law enforcement officers and
scores of military-style tactical vehicles," but is quick to have an expert
standing by to justify it as "perfect sense."
Just perfect. All that for one bleeding, injured
19 year old.
One wonders how many tank divisions and predator
squadrons might have been called in if this was one of the much-fabled
"cells" we hear so much about on TV. Im not disputing the need to capture
the suspect, an obviously dangerous person, given what he is accused of
doing.
I am disputing the federal intervention, the
military suspension of the Constitution and the militarization of local
policing - all greatly warned about numerous times as we descend into
outright authoritarianism, clamoring for the federal troops and toys to come
and save us.
Not only were the public politely "asked" to
stay within their homes, authorities also pushed the,
"media back further and further from the
action unfolding (CBS)."
This bodes well for a free and open society.
In the midst of all this bombing hysteria the
House of Representatives (sic) passed
CISPA, with more government/private
sector spying. Less accountability for the mishandling of your private data,
and more total information awareness totalitarianism is ensured. That is the
direction that every single one of these bills travels, bar none.
Nearly every act of Congress concerning security
of any sort increases government and corporate surveillance powers,
diminishes accountability, oversight and the publics right to challenge
their own surveillance by authorities both public and private.
We are living more and more
in The Matrix, with
4th Amendment protections now considered "quaint" and of a bygone
era that no longer has any relevance today.
Praise for surveillance cameras has been noted
since Boston with calls for more public surveillance, more facial
recognition, more integration of things like traffic cameras and license
plate readers.
"I think CCTV cameras are much more needed
in urban areas."
-Rep. Peter King (R), New York,
House Committee on Homeland Security
Of course he does. He thought that before this
latest photo op.
The answer is always more security, more
surveillance, more intrusion, and less individual protection from government
and from the private corporate sector.
A tremendous catharsis overwhelmed Boston with
the announced capture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, as if that explained and ended
everything. When you enact martial law with thousands of machinegun wielding
storm-troopers and armored personnel carriers in the streets, and then make
them go away, the people will be grateful. No doubt.
But this is where the story should be entering a
new phase of discovery, intense investigation and disclosure. Sorry Boston;
this is far from the end.
It was the FBI, apparently, who had monitored
the two Chechen brothers for years, according to
their own mother.
Zubeidat K. Tsarnaeva claims the
FBI had
contacted her and her sons repeatedly over the past 5 years.
She even claims that the two were "controlled"
by the Feds and "set up" in some kind of sting operation. If that sounds
baseless, well we have already had an admission by FBI that they "interviewed" the older brother Tamerlan back in 2011.
Further, the
Wall Street Journal reports that this FBI interview was in response to a
"request by the Russian government."
Scratch the vinyl. Say what?
Russian intelligence/counter-terrorism is
already reported to have asked FBI to check out the older brother, now
deceased, whom the FBI says blew up bombs at the 2013 Boston Marathon. The
FBI admits to talking to this suspect. They then claim, absurdly to have
"closed the file" because they allegedly found nothing "suspicious."
Do these terrorist suspect files even get closed
at all? Were straining credulity here.
Magnitudes more disturbing than any of that is
the actual on the record activity by the FBI
in at least 17 "terrorism" cases with so-called "foiled plots" since
the
9/11 attacks:
What
FBI does routinely - and this is not in
dispute - is to orchestrate terror bombings with targeted individuals.
These
bombings are suggested and assisted by an undercover FBI provocateur. Often fake explosives and arms are provided. The
targeted individuals are strictly monitored, and then set up and arrested
with spectacular headlines and a grateful public that was saved from yet
another act of senseless terror.
The plots are provoked by the government itself
in a controversial practice that many call "entrapment."
Little is known about the operational planning,
other than a vague claim by the boys mother alleging "control" and "set
up."
However, some highly suspicious evidence has
emerged from the bombing incident itself. Two main things remain
unexplained, and corporate media has not, to my knowledge, investigated the
most disturbing evidence the public has seen so far.
This corporate media blackout is indicative of
unreported, behind the scenes answers likely given by authorities when nosy
reporters inquire about these matters.
-
First
We have the cross country coach from the
University of Mobile, AL
saying that authorities announced "training exercises" by the
bomb squad at the start of the race.
Bomb sniffing dogs were present and
used, according to Alastair ("Ali") Stevenson, who ran the race.
Repeated public address announcements told the runners and
spectators to "
not worry, this is just a training exercise."
A lengthy list of justifiable questions
springs to mind, which any reporter worth his lunch would
immediately want to ask. Yet, none of these questions, and none of
the responses to them were published last week. But how could that
be?
Lets start with the absurdity of
running a "training exercise" with the bomb squad in the middle of a
sprawling, 26 mile long city-wide event that draws 500,000
spectators and more than 22,000 runners. Its not really a time for
an "exercise," but a time to actually protect the public, no? Am I
out of line here? Im sure someone will inform me if I am.
Is this phrase "training exercise" a
public relations lie to calm the sheeple, when in fact it is not an
"exercise" at all, but a live security detail searching for possible
explosives?
Other obvious questions concern,
-
Who participated in this
exercise?
-
Which agencies and which private
entities?
-
What were the specifics of the
exercise?
-
Did this alleged exercise open
up security holes by giving away critical information about
security procedures to numerous parties beyond the control
of law enforcement?
-
Were explosives, real or fake,
involved?
-
Why is information regarding
this exercise covered up?
The little matter of who was involved
brings up big main question number two.
-
Second
Photographic images from the finish line/bombing of the Boston
Marathon show a collection of suspicious characters acting in some
semi-official capacity.
What little can be discerned from the
photos suggests they may be military mercenary contractors, possibly
from a company called Craft International.
These men wore large black backpacks,
very similar to the exploded backpack seen in photos immediately
after the bombing. They also stand in positions very near the
location of one of the bombs. They communicate with one another.
One seems to hold a device in hand,
perhaps a radiation detector.
Others, who are dressed identically, rush over to an FBI bomb
squad truck, which arrives minutes after the detonations. They talk
with FBI personnel.
This all suggests that these men were
coordinating with the FBI bomb squad all along. Is this the
"exercise?"
It also suggests that the FBIs bomb squad (a federal
entity) was already present before the bombings even happened. Why
is a federal bomb squad unit at a marathon race even before bombings
occur?
Ill unload just one more question,
concerning these mysterious, unnamed operatives.
How can private military mercenaries be
involved in any way, shape or form with domestic security on US
streets, and notably at an event that turned out to be highly
insecure, in the extreme?
Perhaps our society has reached that tipping
point into utter insanity and breakdown.
The two brothers Tsarnaev have been established
by the FBI as the only perpetrators, the only suspects, the only reason for
the Boston bombings to have occurred.
An FBI press conference went so far as to
caution the entire media and public against looking elsewhere:
"For clarity these images should be the only
ones, I emphasize the only ones, that the public should view to assist
us.
Other photos should not be deemed credible
and they unnecessarily divert the publics attention in the wrong
direction and create undo work for vital law enforcement resources."
-Special Agent Rick DesLauriers,
the head of the FBIs Boston office
I find it hard to interpret this diktat as
anything other than a direct order to narrow ones thinking and evidentiary
standards. The entire nation has been cautioned that all
other evidence is to be deemed by the civilized world as not "credible."
As
George W. Bush said a decade prior, at the United Nations:
"Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy
theories
"
One might expect such direct state orders inside
Soviet Russia, but in our allegedly free society with its proudly proclaimed
"free press" this is disturbing.
The FBI has just discredited the entire concept
of investigative journalism and assumed the role of sole authority on all
information related to this case. The media is cautioned not to entertain
any additional facts, no matter how they may appear to bear on the case.
Nothing that doesnt come directly from the
Federal Bureau of Investigation is to be considered "credible" by anyone.
Period...
So,
-
Is this the end of the so-called "free
society?"
-
Land of the free, home of the brave?
-
Or is our new paradigm the land of the
surveilled and controlled, home of the cowering, with martial law
and propaganda for all?
And with so many thousands upon thousands of law
enforcers available at the touch of a button,
-
How about sending, say, one of them to
investigate at least 14 counts of manslaughter and massive criminal
negligence at that Texas fertilizer plant explosion?
-
Or is that not in the script?
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev lies in critical
condition since Friday evening, but as of Sunday morning:
"Boston Mayor: Bombing Suspects Acted Alone"
Reliable Stenography by
Time Magazine & Associated Press
How the hell would he know?
Several hours later:
"Bombing suspect throat injury
prevents questioning Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for now - Boston Marathon bombing
suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is in a hospital, sedated and unable to be
interrogated because of a throat injury. Authorities want to know if
anyone else was involved."
