Sociopaths or psychopaths are individuals who
lack empathy and engage in predatory behavior without remorse or guilt.
In
general, this lack of conscience may stem from a conditioned lack of
emotional identification with the victim, a narcissistic love of self that
overrides any concern for others, or the mechanical inability to feel any
emotion other than ones which are chemical or hormonal in origin.
There are different categories
of psychopaths
depending on the underlying cause for their condition and how well they
blend into society.
Criminal and
Successful Psychopaths
Criminal psychopaths are those who are crude enough in their manipulations
to be identified and apprehended by legal and medical institutions.
They are
known as serial killers, con-artists, burglars, mobsters, mad tyrants,
rapists, and delinquents. These comprise a small percentage of psychopaths,
and only about 1% of the population.
The rest are successful psychopaths who evade detection by optimally
conforming to social ideals without compromising their manipulative nature.
They are skilled at faking emotions and passing themselves off as charming,
caring, and sociable people.
Some use their conformity to appear ordinary,
others are more ambitious and become symbols of success by using their charm
and intellect to rapidly climb the corporate, political, academic,
religious, military, or social ladder.
Between 20% and 50% of the population
is included in this category.
In general, criminal psychopaths consistently violate laws and social norms
while successful psychopaths make use of them.
The orthodox medical
establishment ,
presently recognizes only the first category under the term
"Antisocial Personality Disorder."
There is no diagnostic term categorizing
successful psychopaths, who continue to remain medically unidentified.
This is no surprise considering a significant
portion of the medical establishment consists of these individuals.
When
mainstream media and medical literature use the term
"psychopath" or "sociopath," they are referring to the small minority of criminal
psychopaths.
In this article, the term encompasses multiple
subcategories and applies to all individuals who lack empathy, whether they
are criminals or not.
Expanded Model of
Human Behavior
To understand psychopathy, one must first understand human behavior.
The
enigma of human behavior is commonly reduced to a question of nature versus
nurture, genetics versus environment.
Typical of materialistic determinism, this model
is dangerously simplistic because it focuses only upon the physical and
causal basis of human behavior, leaving out the metaphysical factors which
are equally as important.
An expanded model for human behavior would
include the following factors:
-
environment - physical influences,
social conditioning, mind programming, and education
-
genetics - instinctual bias, physical
limitations, and neurochemical makeup
-
soul nature - metaphysical composition
based upon level of metaphysical evolution, acquired and shaped by
the experiences of prior incarnations
-
fate - predestined and synchronistically
arranged experiences that improve soul nature and thus change
behavior, also the unwitting modification of one's behavior to
accommodate another's fate
-
freewill - personal action taken out of
choice, entirely non-deterministic
-
nonphysical influences - divine
inspiration, telepathic persuasion, etheric thought-forms, and
various hyperdimensional technologies
Souled and Nonsouled
Psychopaths
The term "soul" may be defined as a nonphysical unit of consciousness whose
core individuality survives death and rebirth.
By this definition,
some
people have individualized souls, some do not.
The latter incarnate with
definite soul energy, but nothing sufficiently individualized to avoid
dissolution after death.
-
The individualized consciousness of souled
humans affords them the ability to choose what to do with the genetic,
environmental, and
karmic conditions they acquire upon incarnating.
-
Nonsouled humans lack this choice and are entirely the product of their
environment and genetics.
-
Psychopaths exist within both categories.
Souled psychopaths are either environmentally programmed to act against
their own conscience, or else have made the consistent choice to behave in a
narcissistic and predatory manner.
Those who are programmed have chance for
recovery, while the attempt to change those who choose psychopathy only
reinforces their behavior. Souled psychopaths feel love and hate, but only
love for self and hate for others.
This condition is well illustrated by certain Nazis or Zionists who love
their own race but feel no guilt about murdering those of another.
Souled
psychopaths also have empathy and conscience, but these are perverted and
reserved for special cases.
For example, some mobsters seem to act upon a
strong moral code and thus appear as upright heroes to those they protect,
but are nevertheless criminal psychopaths.
The greatest tyrants in history were souled
psychopaths who passionately pursued their twisted goals.
Since love, empathy, and freewill are qualities associated with having a
soul, nonsouled humans are psychopaths by definition. This doesn't mean all
act in obviously predatory ways, just that the severity of their
manipulative behavior depends mostly upon environmental and genetic factors,
which vary greatly from person to person.
Those who face adversity during childhood often
mature into criminal psychopaths, while those who have more secure
upbringings are less maladjusted and become successful psychopaths.
No
amount of education, medication, or programming can instill genuine empathy
and love within them, for they lack the soul nature necessary to exude these
qualities.
Both souled and nonsouled psychopaths display disregard for the suffering of
others.
While the souled psychopath loves himself beyond
everyone else and thus feels justified in exploiting them, the nonsouled
psychopath freely exploits others because he lacks the ability to love or
empathize with anything.
Genetics
Genetic characteristics determine the physical biases, limitations, and
capabilities of an individual.
A nonsouled person will be at the mercy of
these characteristics while a souled person can choose how to utilize them.
Souls often select the bodies into which they incarnate, seeking ones which
provide the optimal "toolbox" for their metaphysical needs and best serves
their learning agenda or mission.
Thus, genetics and soul nature tend to
correspond.
A nonsouled person with a "sharp" set of tools
may, in accordance with environmental programming, use his or her
intellectual abilities to deceive and manipulate with perfection.
For
example, the CEO who manipulated his way up the corporate ladder may simply
be an nonsouled psychopath who used his genetic gifts to embody the societal
norm of material success.
Genetic flaws can also result in brain abnormalities that hinder the
balanced expression of emotion, a common condition in criminal psychopaths.
Chemical and electromagnetic factors can
exacerbate these tendencies.
The Metaphysical
Significance of Bloodlines
Because soul nature and genetics are coupled, the metaphysical significance
of bloodlines becomes clear.
Bloodlines are characterized by concentrations
of specific genetic traits passed down through generations.
Correspondingly, souled members of that bloodline share common metaphysical characteristics,
suggesting that bloodlines provide the physical vehicle for the
implementation of metaphysical goals requiring multiple generations to
accomplish.
Thus there exist a variety of bloodlines, each with unique metaphysical
predispositions.
While some are altruistic and noble in nature, others exist
to engage in parasitical elitism and are genetically biased toward
successful psychopathy.
In that case, nonsouled members would have a
high probability of being actively psychopathic.
Among its souled members,
most incarnate to optimally continue their malevolent agendas, while a few
deviate and use their acquired abilities for the better.
By genealogically
tracing bloodlines and correlating them with historical data, one can
determine the fundamental destiny of its descendents.
For example, it is well known that US
presidential candidates with the strongest royal lineage become elected.
Diffusion of
Psychopathic Bloodlines
Due to crossbreeding, many bloodlines transcend racial boundaries and are
not geographically isolated.
An exception would be
royal lineages where
active measures are taken to keep the bloodline pure and geographically
concentrated.
Nevertheless, the important point is that branches of
bloodlines biased toward psychopathy inevitably diffuse into the general
population and exist in all races.
This implies several things.
-
First, it shows that not only is racist prejudice morally repugnant, but it
is also logically flawed because its obtuse criteria falsely condemns the
innocent among the hated race and excuses the virulent bloodlines within the
favored race.
For example, the Nazis condemned the entire Jewish people as
subhuman psychopaths when only a few non-semitic bloodlines passing
themselves off as Jews justified this claim; there were equal concentrations
of psychopathic bloodlines within the caucasian race itself, obviously
overlooked by the Nazis due to the blind favoritism of their ideology.
-
Second, unless a bloodline is geographically isolated or physiologically
unique, it is impossible to identify psychopaths by these traits alone.
The
purpose of identification is not to persecute them, but to identify such
behavior when it occurs and understand why it happens.
The success of psychopaths depends heavily upon others excusing their action
with rationalizations built on false assumptions.
For instance, a nonsouled
psychopath may abuse his wife and after she leaves him, he may promise
change and use sweet words to appear remorseful.
The false assumption is
that this person is capable and willing to change for the better. In truth,
he is incapable of feeling empathy or remorse and fakes these qualities to
perpetuate his manipulations.
Understanding the physical and metaphysical
basis of human behavior allows one to avoid making such false assumptions
and see through false guises that would otherwise appear as genuine.
Psychopathy and
Negative Control Systems
Psychopaths who are most intelligent and powerful tend to use lesser ones to
do their bidding.
This forms a web of control, a negative hierarchy of
manipulation that spans from
elite globalist cabals down to the neighborhood
delinquent or psychopathic spouse.
This is not to suggest that the global
elite are directly commanding local psychopaths, but rather that there
exists a hidden element unifying this hierarchy.
This hidden element originates beyond our realm and consists of advanced
non-human psychopaths of an alien or demonic nature who use
hyperdimensional
technology or telepathic influence to direct all lesser psychopaths, most
easily nonsouled ones who lack freewill and are thus freely controlled.
This hyperdimensional control system may
be appropriately termed the "Matrix," and the lesser psychopaths may be called
"Matrix Agents" due to the similarity between their functions and the themes
depicted in the movie.
Empathy is antithetical to control, which is why control systems demand
psychopathy as the standard mode of function. Society is best manipulated
through an abundant distribution of psychopaths among the lower and upper
ranks of society.
Toward this end, certain bloodlines have been created or
tweaked by negative alien forces to assist the incarnation of malevolently souled individuals, and thus some instances of psychopathy can be said to
have alien origins.
Those not genetically biased toward psychopathic
behavior are nevertheless easily programmed into supporting or idolizing
such behavior, especially if they lack the freewill and discernment
associated with having a well developed soul.
The Human Condition
The problem of psychopathy rests upon the fact that only the minority of souled psychopaths who have been programmed against their conscience are
capable of changing for the better.
The other two categories, nonsouled
psychopaths and those who choose the path of predation, are in the majority,
diffused among the population, and beyond rehabilitation.
Their emulation of social ideals and lack of
guilt allows them to rise high in society and exploit the masses at large.
Our culture's idolization of psychopathic qualities such as ego-centrism,
ruthless ambition, and superficiality provides warm waters for these sharks.
Thus, lack of knowledge among people concerning the prevalence, subtlety,
and guile of psychopaths only perpetuates their behavior.
Because of ignorance of metaphysical factors, it is commonly assumed that
all psychopaths are treatable.
In truth, souled psychopaths who choose their
path and nonsouled psychopaths are beyond hope:
any energy invested toward "changing them" will be wasted, or worse, serve to reinforce their predatory
behavior.
In short, they abuse your respect, exploit your empathy, and feed
upon what energy you put into them.
They are best avoided.
