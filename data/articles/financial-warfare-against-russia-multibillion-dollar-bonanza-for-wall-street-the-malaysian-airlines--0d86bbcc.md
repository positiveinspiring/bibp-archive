While the mainstream media
casually accuses Moscow without evidence of having
orchestrated the shoot down of Malaysian Airlines MH17
in liaison with the Donesk rebels, the backlash of the
crisis on international financial markets and on
Russia's financial system has passed virtually
unnoticed.
Moreover, the political
threats and insinuations directed against the Russian
Federation in the wake of the July 17 disaster, have
been coupled with a renewed wave of economic sanctions
directed against major Russian corporations and
financial institutions.
Inside Information and
Foreknowledge
The conduct
of speculative operations both prior and in the wake of the July 17
crash, is also a major consideration: In the functioning of World
financial markets, terror events, natural disasters as well as major
tragedies such as MH17 will invariably have an impact on the short term
behavior of financial markets including major stock markets, the foreign
exchange market as well the energy and commodities markets.
It should be noted that foreknowledge of
a terror event such as the MH17 crash of July 17 over Eastern
Ukraine's warzone, offers an opportunity to the perpetrators as well as
those who have advanced knowledge of the terror event to conduct profitable
speculative transactions on various financial markets.
Cui bono? Wall Street or Moscow's Financial
Establishment?
In other words,
those who planned the attack on MH17 (including their political and
economic sponsors) had in their possession valuable and confidential
information which could be used in large scale speculative undertakings,
including options trade on the DJIA, the Moscow Stock exchange (MICEX),
foreign exchange markets, not to mention speculative trade (e.g. put
options) on airline stocks.
What is described above is routine in the
frequent conduct of "risk free" speculative trade by major financial
institutions.
Major financial actors who had foreknowledge of
the MH17 event of July 17 would have made billions of windfall gains in
speculative transactions.
With foreknowledge of the crash, institutional
speculators would be in a position to accurately "predict" the short term
decline of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other major stock markets,
commodity and forex indexes and act accordingly, placing speculative bets
through the use of different financial instruments.
Moreover, there is also an overlap between Wall
Street and the corporate financial media:
Timely news releases by Bloomberg, the Wall
Street Journal, the Financial Times, etc. in the wake of a major
international event often exert a decisive influence on the actual
movement of major financial indicators.
At the same time, these powerful financial media
- which influence investors' perceptions regarding future market trends -
overlap symbiotically with partner interests on Wall Street which are
directly involved in undertaking major transactions.
In fact, the corporate
financial media are invariably major actors on Wall Street or the City of
London.
Who are the major shareholders of the WSJ, the
Financial Times or the Economist? Is there a conflict of interest?
The New York Stock Exchange
In the wake of the July 17 crash of MH17, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declined from its 17150 peak and
subsequently bounced back (see chart below).
Foreknowledge of the MH17 would have allowed the
reaping of financial gains on the short term movement of the Dow from one
day to the next.

The London Stock Market on July 17
While the NYSE was open on the 17th after the
disaster over Ukraine, the London Market Stock opened up on Friday the 18th
and experienced a short term slump in market values, rebounding at the end
of trade on the 18th.

The Moscow Stock Exchange
The tragic event of July 17, coupled with
immediate accusations directed against Russia, contributed to precipitating
the tumble of the Moscow stock exchange (see chart below).
While European stock markets were also affected,
the most dramatic decline was recorded on the Moscow Stock Exchange, with
Moscow's MICEX index falling by 2.3 per cent in one day and its
dollar-traded related index, the RTS index, dropping by 3.8 per cent. (Reuters,
July 18, 2014 - see chart below)
Those who had advanced knowledge of the MH17
crash and the likely accusations directed against Russia by president Obama
would no doubt have placed their bets on a decline of both the MICEX and the
Russian ruble.

The Sanctions Regime
The economic sanctions regime initiated by the
Obama administration had targeted the Russia's arms industry, its major
energy giants including state owned Gazprom and Rosneft as well as the
privately owned gas conglomerate Novatek.
Major Russian financial institutions were also
the object of sanctions.
In a bitter irony, late Wednesday July 16th
(ET), one day before the MH17 tragedy, the Obama administration announced a
new set of sweeping sanctions directed against the Russian Federation:
[L]ate Wednesday [July 16, 2014] , President
Barack Obama had announced fresh sanctions targeting Russia's large-cap
companies that included bellwether energy and banking companies
"We have to see concrete actions, and
not just words that Russia in fact is committed to trying to end
this conflict along the Russia-Ukraine border," Obama stated at the
White House after announcing fresh sanctions on Russia's large-caps.

Crash, Fresh US Sanctions: Beware of Funds with Russia Exposure,
Zaks, July 18, 2014
It is worth noting that Rosneft has a gas deal
with Exxon Mobil.
The endgame of the sanctions regime is economic
conquest, namely to weaken Russia's energy giants with a view to ultimately
modifying their ownership structure:
That the United States went for such a big
company [i.e. sanctions] shows that it means business.
Rosneft has outstanding debts of about $70
billion, close to its market capitalization, forcing it to seek
persistent refinancing - and, leaving aside some Russian and Chinese
financing, only the international dollar markets can provide sufficient
financing.
Rosneft will have to reduce its capital
expenditures because of the U.S. sanctions."

Following Obama's timely announcement on the
16th of July, confirming a new wave of sanctions, the decline of stock
values on Moscow's Stock Exchange started at the opening of trade on July
17th prior to the crash of MH17.
Currency Markets:
Decline of the Ruble
Currency markets were also affected.
While the
event did not precipitate a significant decline of the Malaysian ringgit,
the Russian ruble fell by 1.8 per cent against the US dollar, its biggest
one-day decline since June 2013. (Reuters, July 18, 2014).
In the wake of the July 17 crash in Ukraine, the
Russian ruble has continued to decline (see chart below).
Ongoing threats pertaining to Russia's
alleged role in the downing of MH17 not to mention the implementation of new
sanctions against Russia announced on the 16 of July, have resulted in a
significant decline of the Russian ruble.
It should be understood that the Russian
central bank must have acted to prevent a further decline of the ruble, most
probably using its forex reserves to counteract the speculative attack
against the ruble,
leading
to a significant capital outflow of Russia's dollar reserves.

Decline in Airline
Stocks
There was a significant decline in airline stock
values quoted on NASDAQ on July 17th following the crash of MH17 (see chart
below) characterized by a dip on the 17th and a recovery on the 18th.
Those who had foreknowledge of the MH17 crash
could have placed safe speculative bets reaping substantial profits.
As outlined at our introduction the issue of
foreknowledge is of crucial significance. By definition the criminal
perpetrators of the MH17 crash had foreknowledge which could have been used
by partner financial entities involved in speculative trade.
This particular dimension of MH17
foreknowledge - reminiscent of the short selling of airline stock in the
days preceding 9/11 - requires further analysis and investigation.
It should be a component of the criminal
investigation into the July 17 crash itself.

The Fate of Malaysian
Airlines
With the mysterious disappearance of MH370 in
March, the number of MH passengers had dropped by 60 per cent. Malaysian
Airline System's (MAS) financial situation had become increasingly fragile.
Following the MH17 crash, Malaysian Airlines
System is up for complete privatization.
"MAS is almost 70 per cent owned by the
government investment vehicle Kazanah Nasional, which earlier this year
expressed interest in offloading part of its holding."
(ABC
New Australia, July 21, 2014)
The annual decline in MAS stock is of the order
of 25.8 (see chart below)
