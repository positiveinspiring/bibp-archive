Defense Electronic Security Command
Keep soldiers safe but murder foreigners. This agency "which
coordinates intelligence surveillance and countermeasures against threats
to the integrity of military electron equipment and electronic battlefield
operations" is used in situations of aggression against foreign people in
the name of national security.
But, whose national security? Not yours and not mine. Demonstration after
demonstration and petition after petition has pleaded with Washington to
end the bombings against the people of Iraq because it is killing innocent
people and causing babies to be born deformed. Madelyn Albright stated that
"this is all worth it." Is it?
The leader of Iraq is still in power but the people are dying. These people
used to have a productive economy but no one considers it productive now.
Do we need this agency? No.
