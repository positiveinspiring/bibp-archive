# New Documents Shed Light on NSA's Dragnet Surveillance

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_nsa35.htm

With the
Obama
administration in full damage control mode
over revelations of blanket surveillance of global
electronic communications, new documents published by
The Guardian, including,
...show that,
"a federal judge sitting on
the secret surveillance panel called the Fisa court
would approve a bulk collection order for internet
metadata 'every 90 days'."
An unnamed,
"senior administration
official" confirmed the existence of a Bush-era
surveillance program which gobbled-up "vast amounts of
records detailing the email and internet usage of
Americans," but claimed, without evidence, that "it
ended in 2001," according to The Guardian.
Early last month, the British
newspaper began publishing documents provided by former NSA
contractor Edward Snowden, including a Top Secret
FISA court order to Verizon Business Services, which
requires the firm "on an ongoing, daily basis" to hand over
information on all telephone calls within its system.
The Wall Street Journal reported that the NSA's,
"monitoring of Americans
includes customer records from the three major phone
networks as well as emails and Web searches, and the
agency also has cataloged credit-card transactions."
The secret state's spying
initiative,
"also encompasses phone-call
data from AT&T Inc. and Sprint Nextel Corp., records
from Internet-service providers and purchase
information."
Days later,
The Washington Post revealed that the Bush
administration's "warrantless wiretapping" program known as
STELLAR WIND, had been succeeded by four "collection
programs" two of which, MAINWAY and MARINA,
"process trillions of
'metadata' records for storage and analysis."
Additional programs, the Post
reported, operating,
"on a much smaller scale,
are aimed at content," one of which "intercepts
telephone calls and routes the spoken words to a system
called NUCLEON."
Although the news outlets
principally responsible for bringing these stories to light,
principally,
-
The Guardian
-
Washington Post
-
South China Morning Post
-
now
Der Spiegel,
...have not (as yet) published complete
sets of NSA documents, and their reporting has barely
scratched the surface of content-siphoning deep packet
inspection (DPI) programs for internet and telephone
surveillance (indeed, PRISM may be a subset of larger and
more pernicious programs that collect, analyze and store
everything), what we have learned so far is deeply
troubling and pose grave threats to civil liberties.
New
PRISM Slides, More Questions
Filling in some of the blanks, on June 29
The Washington Post published
four additional PRISM
slides from the 41-slide deck provided to The Guardian
and Post by Edward Snowden.
Confirming what civil libertarians, journalists and
political analysts have long maintained, NSA can and
probably does "acquire" anything an individual analyst might
request as Snowden averred.
This includes, according to new
information provided by the Post:
-
chats
-
email
-
file
transfers
-
internet telephone
-
login/ID
-
metadata
-
photos
-
social networking
-
stored data in the cloud
-
video
-
video conferencing
If that isn't a surveillance dragnet, then words
fail.
Recall, that previous reporting disclosed that major US
internet and high tech firms,
...gave NSA
"direct access" to their systems.
"The program," according to
The Guardian, "facilitates extensive, in-depth
surveillance on live communications and stored
information. The law allows for the targeting of any
customers of participating firms who live outside the
US, or those Americans whose communications include
people outside the US."
"It also opens the
possibility of communications made entirely within the
US being collected without warrants," a near probability
in this writer's opinion.
In a report that appeared the
same day,
The Washington Post disclosed that NSA and the FBI,
"are tapping directly into
the central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet
companies, extracting audio and video chats,
photographs, e-mails, documents, and connection logs
that enable analysts to track foreign targets," and that
the agency "s accustomed to corporate partnerships that
help it divert data traffic or sidestep barriers."
Although the firms all denied
that they hand over customer data to the government, their
self-serving claims are undercut by evidence that NSA-cleared
company personnel, including "collection managers," send,
"content tasking
instructions directly to equipment installed at
company-controlled locations," rather than directly to
company servers.
"Under Prism," the
Associated Press reported, "the delivery process
varied by company."
"Google, for instance, says it makes secure file
transfers. Others use contractors or have set up
stand-alone systems. Some have set up user interfaces
making it easier for the government, according to a
security expert familiar with the process."
"With Prism," AP reported, "the government gets a user's
entire email inbox. Every email, including contacts with
American citizens, becomes government property."
"Once the NSA has an inbox, it can search its huge
archives for information about everyone with whom the
target communicated. All those people can be
investigated, too."
The slides published June 29
shed some light on how the process works.
We learn for example that when
an analyst "tasks" PRISM for information on a new "target,"
it is automatically passed on to a supervisor who,
"who reviews the 'selectors'
or search terms. The supervisor must endorse the
analyst's 'reasonable belief,' defined as 51 percent
confidence, that the specified target is a foreign
national who is overseas at the time of collection."
Tasking orders can be sent to
multiple sources,
"for example, to a private
company and to an NSA access point that taps into the
Internet's main gateway switches."
(for background see: Mark
Klein,
Wiring Up the Big Brother Machine, Klein's
affidavit
in EFF's lawsuit,
Hepting v.
AT&T and his groundbreaking 2006 piece for
Wired Magazine).
The FBI,
"uses government equipment
on private company property to retrieve matching
information from a participating company, such as
Microsoft or Yahoo and pass it without further review to
the NSA."
(see Verizon whistleblower Babak Pasdar's
affidavit on how FBI "tasking" is accomplished via
its Quantico circuit).
"For stored communications, but not for live
surveillance" we're informed that the Bureau's
Electronic Communications Surveillance Unit (ECSU)
"consults its own databases to make sure the selectors
do not match known Americans."
If this is what the Bureau is
now claiming, it is disingenuous at best.
In fact, as
Antifascist Calling reported back in 2009, the FBI's
Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW), a virtual Library of
Babel, is a content management and data mining system with
the ability to access and analyze aggregated data from some
fifty hitherto separate datasets.
That the Bureau would feel
compelled to "minimize" domestic information it provides to
a "sister" agency beggars belief.
In fact, one of the new PRISM slides reveal that from,
"the FBI's interception unit
on the premises of private companies, the information is
passed to one or more 'customers' at the NSA, CIA or
FBI."
"Depending on the company," Barton Gellman and Todd
Lindeman report, "a tasking may return e-mails,
attachments, address books, calendars, files stored in
the cloud, text or audio or video chats and 'metadata'
that identify the locations, devices used and other
information about a target."
Elapsed times from "tasking to
response" from the above-named firms or other "partners"
such as banks, credit card companies, etc. range from
"minutes to hours."
An unnamed "senior intelligence
official" told the Post,
"Much as we might wish
otherwise, the latency is not zero."
"After communications information is acquired," the data
is "processed and analyzed by specialized systems that
handle voice, text, video and 'digital network
information' that includes the locations and unique
device signatures of targets."
We also learn how some of these
code named systems function.
For example, PRINTURA is described as a tool,
"which automates the traffic
flow."
The Post reports that,
"the same FBI-run equipment
sends the search results to the NSA."
Once it is received, in bulk,
-
"PRINTURA sorts and
dispatches the data stream through a complex
sequence of systems that extract and process voice,
text, video and metadata.
-
Once dispatched from
PRINTURA, described as a "librarian and traffic
cop,"
While the Post claims
that,
"systems identified as
FALLOUT and CONVEYANCE appear to be the final filtering
to reduce the intake of information about Americans,"
information provided by NSA whistleblower William Binney
dispute such assertions.
In fact, Binney told
investigative journalist James Bamford for his
Wired Magazine piece on NSA's giant Utah Data
Center, that the agency,
"could have installed its
tapping gear at the nation's cable landing stations -
the more than two dozen sites on the periphery of the US
where fiber-optic cables come ashore. If it had taken
that route, the NSA would have been able to limit its
eavesdropping to just international communications,
which at the time was all that was allowed under US
law."
"Instead," the former cofounder of the agency's Signals
Intelligence Automation Research Center (SARC) told
Bamford that NSA "chose to put the wiretapping rooms at
key junction points throughout the country - large,
windowless buildings known as switches--thus gaining
access to not just international communications but also
to most of the domestic traffic flowing through the US."
"The network of intercept stations goes far beyond the
single room in an AT&T building in San Francisco exposed
by a whistle-blower in 2006.
'I think there's 10 to
20 of them,' Binney says. 'That's not just San
Francisco; they have them in the middle of the
country and also on the East Coast'."
In other words, NSA's network of
"secret rooms" were installed at key junctures that would
facilitate, not "minimize" wholesale domestic surveillance.
Expanding on just how intrusive NSA "collection" programs
are, Binney told
The New Yorker in a Jane Mayer piece on the
Obama regime's prosecution of NSA whistleblower Thomas
Drake, that a surveillance program he helped design as
SARC director, ThinThread, was "bastardized" after 9/11 and
"stripped of privacy controls" that would filter out
Americans' communications.
"'It was my brainchild,'
Binney told Mayer.
"'But they removed the
protections, the anonymization process. When you
remove that, you can target anyone.'
He said that although he was
not 'read in' to the new secret surveillance program,
'my people were brought
in, and they told me, 'Can you believe they're doing
this? They're getting billing records on US
citizens! They're putting pen registers' - logs of
dialed phone numbers - 'on everyone in the
country!'"
And they continue to do so today
without one iota of oversight from a thoroughly compromised
Congress.
New
Programs Exposed
The programs described above all evolved from the Bush
administration's so-called President's Surveillance
Program, PSP, which has continued under Obama.
As
Antifascist Calling reported in 2009, citing a
declassified 38-page
report by inspectors general of the CIA, NSA, the
Departments of Defense, Justice and the Office of the
Director of National Intelligence, the report failed to
disclose what these programs actually do, claiming they are
"too sensitive" for an "unclassified setting."
Shrouded beneath impenetrable layers of secrecy and deceit,
these undisclosed programs lie at the dark heart of the
state's war against the American people.
For example, the DOJ's Office of the Inspector General
described FBI participation in the PSP as that of a,
"passive recipient of
intelligence collected under the program."
Recent revelations by Edward
Snowden expose such statements as bald-faced lies.
And when the OIG claimed that
Bureau efforts "to improve cooperation with the NSA to
enhance the usefulness of PSP-derived information to FBI
agents," that too, is a craven misrepresentation given what
we now know about the key role the FBI plays in
NSA's PRISM program.
However, the unclassified version of NSA's Inspector
General's report on the PSP published by
The Guardian paints a far-different picture.
A close reading of the document reveals that a federal judge
sitting on the FISA would approve a bulk collection order
for metadata,
"every 90 days," as long as
it "involved" the "communications with at least one
communicant outside the United States or for which no
communicant was known to be a citizen of the United
States".
"Eventually," Glenn Greenwald and Spencer Ackerman
reported, the agency "gained authority to 'analyze
communications metadata associated with United States
persons and persons believed to be in the United
States'."
Although the administration now
claims that specific program ended in 2011, online
collection of data on Americans continues today.
Last week
The Guardian reported that NSA's Special Source
Operations (SSO) directorate running PRISM is collecting
and analyzing,
"significant amounts of data
from US communications systems in the course of
monitoring foreign targets."
"The NSA," Greenwald and Ackerman disclosed, "called it
the 'One-End Foreign (1EF) solution'."
That program, code named EVIL
OLIVE, was intended to broaden "the scope" of what it is
able to surveil and relied,
"legally, on 'FAA
Authority', a reference to the 2008 Fisa Amendments Act
that relaxed surveillance restrictions."
"This new system, SSO stated in December, enables vastly
increased collection by the NSA of internet traffic.
'The 1EF solution is allowing more than 75% of the
traffic to pass through the filter,' the SSO December
document reads.
'This milestone not only
opened the aperture of the access but allowed the
possibility for more traffic to be identified,
selected and forwarded to NSA repositories'."
After EVIL OLIVE's "deployment,
traffic has literally doubled."
Referencing another NSA collection program, this one code
named SHELL TRUMPET, an SSO official wrote that the program
had just,
"processed its One
Trillionth metadata record."
"Explaining that the five-year old program 'began as a
near-real-time metadata analyzer... for a classic
collection system', the SSO official noted: 'In its five
year history, numerous other systems from across the
Agency have come to use ShellTrumpet's processing
capabilities for performance monitoring' and other
tasks, such as 'direct email tip alerting'," The
Guardian reported.
These, and hitherto as yet
unknown programs, are advancing by leaps and bounds due to
technological breakthroughs, the result of tens of billions
of taxpayer dollars showered on the agency in wake of the
9/11 provocation.
As Greenwald and Ackerman
reported,
"almost half of those
trillion pieces of internet metadata were processed in
2012, the document detailed: 'though it took five years
to get to the one trillion mark, almost half of this
volume was processed in this calendar year'."
"Another SSO entry," this one dated February 6, 2013,
"described ongoing plans to expand metadata collection.
A joint surveillance collection operation with an
unnamed partner agency yielded a new program 'to query
metadata' that was 'turned on in the Fall 2012'."
Two additional programs, code
named MOON LIGHT PATH AND SPINNERET,
"are planned to be added by
September 2013."
Curiously enough, this is when
NSA's Utah Data Center is slated to "go live."
In fact, these programs and their siblings are useful not
simply for harvesting metadata, but for "collecting" and
storing all electronic communications, including their
content; hence the rather circumspect reference to "direct
email tip alerting."
Fully a transatlantic affair, Greenwald and Ackerman noted
that another SSO entry dated September 21, 2012 revealed
that a program called TRANSIENT THURIBLE is,
"'a new Government
Communications Head Quarters (GCHQ) managed XKeyScore (XKS)
Deep Dive was declared operational.' The entry states
that GCHQ 'modified' an existing program so the NSA
could 'benefit' from what GCHQ harvested."
There is much we do not yet know
about these programs, how "collected" data is exploited by
government agencies, nor the present and future implications
for civil liberties and privacy in the United States and
globally.
What we do know however, is that
the Obama administration, including their national security
spokespeople and their media and political apologists are
lying.
