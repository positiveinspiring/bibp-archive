The First Global Revolution
As tyranny continues its march out into the
open, it is increasingly becoming cloaked in green.
Under the guise of saving humanity, a chorus of
recent announcements within elite circles, think-tanks, educational
institutions, and the halls of science are calling for drastic measures to
stop the planet's inevitable implosion from an overshot carrying capacity.
A
United Nations policy paper recently outlined the building blocks
for a world government that would
enforce a "heavy-handed" approach toward humanity's impact on the
environment, as this new epoch of
The Anthropocene Age has begun to
negatively alter the planet in irrevocable ways.
A rather infamous book, from a rather infamous group called
The Club of Rome, is making a reappearance
as humanity hurtles toward demise if its stewardship is not turned over to
technocrats.
Limits to Growth (1972) is nothing short of a blueprint for
population reduction and neo-feudalism; or, as Yale economist Henry
Wallich stated at the time of its release, its implementation means
"consigning billions to poverty."
It appears that this plan has been green-lighted by the elite, as recent MIT
research validates the conclusions drawn by Limits to Growth at this crucial
time when we see the world economy imploding, and a jack-booted green police
ready to hit the streets. According to MIT, we are headed toward a
guaranteed planet-wide economic collapse and "precipitous population
decline" if we do not heed the words of The Club of Rome.
Austerity riots and suicides are filling the streets throughout Europe, as
draconian measures are being taken to curb runaway debt.
This debt has provably been created by
the
Ponzi scheme of international bangksters who have employed a
loan-shark framework that is only paying dividends to those in position to
buy up deliberately collapsed assets for pennies on the dollar.
The global elite continue to ignore that the problems which have been
generated across the globe have very little to do with true resource
shortages, unsustainable economies, or overpopulation; but rather the
centralized control, mismanagement, and outright theft by corporate entities
using globalization as a means of reducing sovereignty and
self-determination.
Resource-rich countries in places like Africa and those in the Middle East
have long been targeted for plunder by colonialists and have never been
rightly permitted to exist free of outside manipulation.
This stratagem has now entered the West, where
we are seeing Europe looted in similar fashion, and the resulting strife is
used to divide and rule. It is the coordinated agenda of a network of
think-tanks, NGOs, and international financiers well-versed in the methods
of divide and conquer that form the real government of the world.
When one begins to piece together the scope of this deliberate looting, and
the inevitable call for solutions from the very same players who should be
held responsible, one might conclude that any of their calls for
intervention based on humanitarian ideals
should be judged a complete scam.
At or near the center of a web which has been woven using academia, top
economists, mainstream media propaganda, climatologists, anthropologists,
NGO's, think-tanks and human rights groups - well meaning, and not-so well
meaning - is The Club of Rome.
First, it is important to understand the genesis of The Club of Rome and its
philosophy, as it might demonstrate an inherent misanthropy that should make
us skeptical of their calls for sustainability, true equality, or the
betterment for individuals who comprise the human race.
Problem-Reaction
The Club of Rome think-tank is likely to have been conceived in 1965 at
David Rockefeller's estate in Bellagio, Italy at an international conference
called "The Conditions of World Order."
Twenty-one "scholars, writers, and scientists"
met to discuss the role of "intellectuals" in the formation of a new world.
It was their larger follow-up meeting of 75 people in Rome, 1968 when the
group formally took the name, The Club of Rome, which has come to
comprise
the very top echelon within all fields relating to human development and
politics.
Despite its trappings of being devoted to a better world for all mankind, it
is overwhelmingly staffed by those born and bred from mega wealth, and those
who have a stated worldview that is not compatible with many of the Club's
purported goals.
This worldview was encapsulated in a follow-up book to
Limits to Growth,
called
The First Global Revolution, which 21 years later laments and
chastises the failure of wider humanity to aggressively implement the Club's
previous suggestions, while openly touting manipulation as a way toward
global unity.
There are many key passages in this book that give a clear indication of the
mindset leading us through the present into the future, but a particularly
striking section comes when they discuss the "limits of democracy:"
Democracy is not a panacea. It cannot
organize everything, and is unaware of its own limits.
(...)
In its present form democracy is not well suited for the tasks ahead.
(...)
We overlook (psychologically speaking, we deny) our ignorance and say we
lack the political will. The crucial need is to revitalize democracy and
give it a breadth of perspective that will enable it to cope with the
evolving global situation. In other words, is this new world we find
ourselves in governable? The answer is probably not with the existing
structures and attitudes.
(page 71-72, online edition)
This is an interesting statement in light of the
one made by University of Oregon Professor, Kari Norgaard, who
recently suggested that those who believe that man-made climate change is a
hoax should be treated as mentally defective racists.
In a letter to Obama, she stated:
'Policymakers should not wait for public
opinion to take necessary action,' she writes, adding, 'Public opinion
does matter in a democracy, but this is a time when following it would
be a serious mistake.'
(Source)
And of course, "policymakers" are very often not
even the democratically elected governments themselves, but international
institutions and councils - like the Club of Rome.
In order to justify such rapid movement taking place outside the framework
of democracy, a threat so vast and so all-encompassing that mobilization
against it must be swift and aggressive is to be sought.
The Club of Rome sought it... and they found it,
by their own admission:
The common enemy of humanity is man. In
searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that
pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the
like would fit the bill. In their totality and their interactions these
phenomena do constitute a common threat which must be confronted
together.
But in designating these dangers as the
enemy, we fall into the trap, which we already have warned readers
about, namely mistaking symptoms for causes. All these dangers are
caused by human intervention in natural processes, and it is only
through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome.
The real enemy is humanity itself.
(page 75, online edition)
Solution
How is it that if these elite intellectuals truly care for the human race,
we see the suppression of true alternative energy, the manipulation of
climate science to achieve anti-human ends, and a centralization of power
that has only lead to a runaway train of elite-induced death?
We are told of how vaccines will make us healthier when they kill and maim.
Without our knowledge or oversight, GMOs have
been introduced to combat food shortages, when they are leading to mass
starvation, suicide, and horrible consequences for human health and the
environment; all while self-sufficiency based on organic principles has
shown to be the consistent solution that could actually feed the planet and
establish sustainable economies. And, of course, we are told that fiat,
debt-based currency will lead to global enrichment, when it only has led us
to our current age of austerity.
The all-encompassing problem faced by humanity on a global scale is indeed
real.
However, the proven track records of those like
the Club of Rome claiming the right to uplift humanity is dismal. In the
foundational areas of human peace and prosperity - economy, health,
environment, science, law, politics, and philosophy - these so-called elites
have failed dramatically.
Due to the length of time their misdirection has
been in effect, it would be unwise to dismiss this as an extended series of
miscalculations that approaches statistical impossibility. Rather, it must
be concluded that it is by design.
Once we draw that inevitable conclusion, their
advice takes on new, much darker meaning; one that inspires us to say with
confidence: the collective problem faced by humanity is collectivism itself,
under the umbrella of a global administration with an agenda to deliberately
collapse the economy and reduce the population.
As hard as it is to admit, the stated agenda by green global government for
uplifting humanity cannot be the real goal - for how can the destiny of
humankind be uplifted through reduced living conditions and extermination?
We are at the crossroads now, as humanity faces the apocalypse brought about
by nihilists and misanthropes.
As the Club of Rome itself has stated:
The acceleration of critical trends and
cross-impacts among them indicates that the window of opportunity for
pulling out of the present global crisis and breaking through to a more
peaceful and sustainable world is likely to be no more than four to five
years from the end of 2008.
This is close in time to the Mayan 2012
prophecy for the end of the current world. The period around the end of
2012 is likely to be a turbulent one for this and other reasons.
Predictions coming from the physical sciences foresee disturbances in
the geomagnetic, electromagnetic and related fields that embed the
planet causing significant damage to telecommunications and impacting
many aspects of human activity and health.
For the esoteric traditions the end of 2012
will be the end of the known world, although the more optimistic
interpretations speak of a new world taking the place of the old.

The time from 2012 until the threshold of 2030
is the time when humanity will face two divergent paths leading to this "new
world:"
The first possibility is massive
decentralization away from harmful bureaucratic and autocratic rule that has
caused economic booms and busts, industrial and corporate cronyism and
abuse, and neo-feudal serfdom; the second is a path down which we are
dragged kicking and screaming through the collapse point prophesied for
2030, ushered in by the technocracy self-fulfilling a world that it wants to
be fully born in 2052.
That world redefines what dystopia means for the
average human subjected to
its ultimately transhuman agenda.
Again, The Club of Rome describes the world of 2052 under its philosophy and
esteemed leadership:
-
Redefining the values which effectively
guide the development of society
-
Developing a new economy, both in theory
and practice, so that,
-
natural and social capital are
correctly valued
-
new financial markets deliver the
goods and services mankind needs in and for a sustainable world
-
sufficient jobs are created to allow
a decent income for all
-
Creating appropriate governance
institutions on a global, national and local level
Its six goals to "shape" this future are:
-
Societal values, which are essential for
a sustainable and equitable society, are fully reflected in all
economic decisions.
-
The economies of the world reflect the
value of natural and social capital, markets operate in a fair and
transparent manner and deliver the goods and services required for a
sustainable society.
-
A more equitable distribution of income
both within and between countries.
-
Access to meaningful work, which
provides enough income to lead a decent life, is guaranteed and
recognized as an essential human right. Job generation has become a
top priority for all investments, costs for unemployment are
considered in decision-making.
-
Ecology is seen as a binding constraint
for all forms of human activity and is therefore managed in a manner
which reflects its biophysical and economic value. Never should the
world be in overshoot.
-
Appropriate governance systems at a
local, national and global level, which can manage the transition
into an equitable and sustainable global world, are established.
Even if some of these guidelines seem attractive
on the surface, we must always return to who is directing the
implementation.
The systematic looting of individual wealth and
production has been collectivized by the power elite with the intention of
giving it back to humanity at a fraction of its initial worth - this is
their track record with such initiatives as
Agenda 21, and the world we currently see
as we look around. It is the playbook of every tyranny that has ever
disgraced the planet.
When we admit to ourselves that what elites state as the world they wish to
see, versus the world they are bound to create based on their actions, then
we have to admit that the conclusions drawn by MIT in support of the Club of
Rome are not those they plan to avoid, but something they desire to use to
assert further control. And it will take place a lot faster with them and
their like in charge of all decisions.
We really are about to witness The First Global Revolution, and it is rooted
in information and ideas.
Despite the challenges we face to alter our
course from the one that has been chosen for us, there is one concept that
we should take from their mission, for it represents the secret to all they
have done so far:
"Change the Story - Change the System".
(Club of Rome)
Let's start telling a story that future
generations will be pleased to hear, instead of the one we are currently
forced to recount.
