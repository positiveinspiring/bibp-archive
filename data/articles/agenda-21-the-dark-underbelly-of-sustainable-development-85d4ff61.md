Sustainable development has been the catchphrase of the environmental
movement for over 20 years and rarely are underlying motives questioned.
After all, a majority of people want a healthy
future, free of pollutants and global warming where the earth is protected
for ourselves and subsequent generations. There is a catch, however.
The underpinnings of sustainable development are
rooted
in Agenda 21, a body of regulations
inspired by
the United Nations (UN) "Earth
Summit" conference in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.
At first glance, the agenda looks beneficial and
harmless - except for the fact that it sets forth a policy which strips
individuals of freedom and controls private land unconstitutionally.
The birth of
sustainable development
The United Nations conference on environment and development, often referred
to as the "Earth Summit," was held in 1992 to advance sustainable
development throughout the world.
Agenda 21 was born out of the summit as an
international standard of policy. On the surface, the agenda appears
favorable - helping to save humans, wildlife and the environment from
destruction through building guidelines and proper management of natural
resources.
But dig a bit deeper and it will soon become
apparent Agenda 21 is yet another vehicle of control.
Code officials
knocking
Imagine officials representing the International Code Council (ICC)
having access to the keys for your home and could enter the property at any
time to check for code 'violations.'
According to
Red State, the Cedar Falls City Council in
Iowa approved an ordinance that will require:
"Mandatory lock boxes [outside of] all
commercial property including apartment buildings and Triplexes. Inside
the box you have to provide keys to all entrances to the property
including keys to individual apartments."
It may seem like cities such as Cedar Falls are
acting locally in the best interest of their community's safety, but in
reality the lock box legislation is based on international code and
regulation which has ties to Agenda 21.
If an ICC official deems a space to be in
violation of Agenda 21 rules, property can be searched (easily with the
provided key), heavily fined or seized at their discretion without due
process.
If Agenda 21 comes to fruition, private land
will be a luxury of the past and citizens will be told how they will live
and where as dictated by UN guidelines.
Global rule and public
lands
The UN publication, "Earth Summit
- Agenda 21," outlines every area of
regulation including industry, science and technology, farming, the role of
children, youth and women in sustainability, water, poverty along with
demographic dynamics and human settlement development.
Concerned citizens believe this framework has
nothing to do with environmentalism and everything to do with control of a
nation's resources. Massive swathes of 'public land' will be under the
command of the government who are then controlled by the policy of the UN.
Many are troubled that the agenda is created by
a global organization yet spoon-fed to the American public under the auspice
of "local" government. If this doesn't sound alarming enough, have a look at
the "Biodiversity Map" of the United States:
The legend indicates the small areas where
citizens would be allowed to live under the rules of the agenda.
Seeing that Americans have a long history of pioneering spirit and
independence, it might be worthwhile to consider the ramifications of Agenda
21.
Does the American public truly desire regulation
by a behemoth world organization or would citizens rather find solutions
within the freedom of authentic, local innovation and small government?
