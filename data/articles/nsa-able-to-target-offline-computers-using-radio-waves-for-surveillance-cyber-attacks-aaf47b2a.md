The National Security Agency (NSA)
has implanted software in about 100,000 computers around the world, allowing
the United States to surveil those machines while creating a trail that can
be used to launch cyber-attacks.
Though most of the software is installed by gaining access to computer
networks, the NSA can also employ technology that enters computers and
alters data without needing internet access.
The secret technology uses covert radio waves transmitted from small circuit
boards and USB cards clandestinely inserted into targeted computers,
The New York Times reported.
The waves can then be sent to a briefcase-sized
relay station intelligence agencies can set up just miles away, according to
NSA documents, computer experts and US officials.
The radio frequency technology - which often needs to be physically inserted
by a spy, manufacturer or unwitting user - has helped US spies access
computers that global adversaries have gone to great lengths to protect from
surveillance or cyber-attack.
The NSA calls use of the infiltration software and radio technology - all
part of a program
known as Quantum - "active defense" against
cyber-attacks, though it has condemned use of similar software by Chinese
attackers against American companies or government agencies.
"What's new here is the scale and the
sophistication of the intelligence agency's ability to get into
computers and networks to which no one has ever had access before,"
James Andrew Lewis, cyber security expert at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington, told The Times.
"Some of these capabilities have been around
for a while, but the combination of learning how to penetrate systems to
insert software and learning how to do that using radio frequencies has
given the U.S. a window it's never had before."
Quantum targets
The Chinese Army has been the most frequent target of Quantum.
The US has accused the Chinese Army of
infiltrating American industrial and military targets to often pilfer
secrets or intellectual property.
Other Quantum targets include Russian military networks, systems used by
Mexican police and drug cartels, trade institutions within the European
Union and even allies like Saudi Arabia, according to American officials and
NSA materials that show sites that the agency calls "computer network
exploitation."
There is no evidence that Quantum's capabilities were used in the US.
While not commenting on the scope of the
program, the NSA said Quantum is not comparable to actions by the Chinese.
"NSA's activities are focused and
specifically deployed against - and only against - valid foreign
intelligence targets in response to intelligence requirements," Vanee
Vines, an agency spokeswoman, said in a statement.
"We do not use foreign intelligence
capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf
of - or give intelligence we collect to - U.S. companies to enhance
their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line."
Parts of Quantum were revealed by documents
leaked by former
NSA contractor Edward
Snowden. A Dutch newspaper published a map indicating where
the US had inserted spy software, usually in secret.
Der Spiegel recently published the NSA's
collection of hardware products used for transmitting and receiving digital
signals from computers,
known as ANT.

An NSA advisory panel, ordered and staffed by President
Barack
Obama to review NSA practices following the Snowden leaks,
recommended the spy agency cease exploiting flaws in common software in the
name of US surveillance.
The panel also suggested the NSA stop
undermining vital encryption protections.
"Holes in encryption software would be more
of a risk to us than a benefit," said Richard A. Clarke, a former
intelligence official and member of the review group.
"If we can find the vulnerability, so can
others. It's more important that we protect our power grid than that we
get into China's."
President Obama is scheduled to announce Friday
what portions of the panel's recommendations he is accepting.
Reuters reported Tuesday that one policy
suggestion from the panel received criticism from an unlikely place
recently.
In a letter sent to Obama on behalf of the federal judicial system as a
whole, former federal judge John Bates, the director of the
Administrative Office of the US courts, warned against a possible "Public
Interest Advocate," which would represent privacy and civil liberty concerns
before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)
court.
The secretive FISA court approves US government
spying requests.
100,000 implants
worldwide
A 2008 map, revealed in the Snowden leaks, offers 20 programs to gain access
to major fiber optic cables in the US and places like Hong Kong and the
Middle East.
The map indicates that the US has already
conducted,
"more than 50,000 worldwide implants."
Though a more recent budget document said that
by the end of 2013, the figure would be at around 85,000. A senior officials
told The Times the figure was more like 100,000.
Officials told The Times most of the implants, by far, were for surveillance
and to serve as early warning for a cyber-attack aimed at the US. One
official likened them to buoys used to track submarines.
The US has targeted a Chinese Army unit thought to be responsible for most
of the bigger cyber-attacks wielded against the US. Documents from Snowden's
trove show the US has two data centers in China from which it can insert
malware into computers.
The US maintains Quantum is not used for economic purposes, as it has
complained that Chinese attacks have done.
"The argument is not working," said Peter W.
Singer, co-author of a new book called 'Cybersecurity and Cyberwar.'
"To the Chinese, gaining economic advantage
is part of national security. And the Snowden revelations have taken a
lot of the pressure off" the Chinese.
The radio-transmission technology employs many
gadgets revealed by Der Spiegel in December.
Among them is
Cottonmouth I, a normal-looking USB plug
with a small transceiver that transmits information from a computer,
"through a covert channel" that allows "data
infiltration and exfiltration."
Most of the revealed products are at least five
years old, The Times reports, but have been updated to make the US less
dependent on hardware installation in its surveillance operations.
The NSA would not discuss the devices despite publication of the documents
describing them by the European news outlets.
"Continuous and selective publication of
specific techniques and tools used by NSA. to pursue legitimate foreign
intelligence targets is detrimental to the security of the United States
and our allies," said Vines.
Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of US House
lawmakers introduced legislation on Tuesday that would require President
Obama to unveil budget figures for all 16 spy agencies.
The secretive "black
budget" for US intelligence agencies was reported to be $53
billion for fiscal year 2013, based on documents from Snowden
reported by The Washington Post.
