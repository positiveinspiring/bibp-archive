The Release of Atomic EnergyAugust 9, 1945
I would like at this time to touch upon the greatest spiritual event which has taken
place since the fourth kingdom of nature, the human kingdom, appeared. I refer to the
release of atomic energy, as related in the newspapers this week, August 6, 1945, in
connection with the bombing of Japan.
Some years ago I told you that the new era would be ushered in by the scientists of the
world and that the inauguration of the kingdom of God on Earth would be heralded by means
of successful scientific investigation. By this first step in the releasing of the energy
of the atom this has been accomplished, and my prophecy has been justified during this
momentous year of our Lord 1945. Let me make one or two statements anent this discovery,
leaving you to make your own application and deductions. Little as to the true nature of
this happening is as yet known, and still less is understood. Certain ideas and suggested
thoughts may be of real value here and enable you to see this stupendous event in better
perspective.
1. It was the imminence of this "release" of energy which was one of the
major subjective factors in the precipitation of this last phase of the war. This world
war started in 1914, but its last and most important phase began in 1939. [492] Up till
then it was a world war. After that date, and because the forces of evil took advantage of
the state of war and belligerency existing on the planet, the real war began, involving
the entire three worlds of human evolution and a consequent activity of the Hierarchy.
Man's attention is normally focused on the externalities of living. Nevertheless, all
great discoveries, such as those made in connection with astronomy or in relation to the
laws of nature or involving such a revelation as that of radioactivity or the
epoch-making event announced this week concerning the first steps taken in the harnessing
of cosmic energy, are ever the result of inner pressure emanating from Forces and Lives
found in high Places. Such inner pressures themselves function under the laws of the
Spirit and not just under what you call natural laws; they are the result of the impelling
work of certain great Lives, working in connection with the third aspect of divinity, that
of active intelligence, and are concerned with the substance or matter aspect of
manifestation. Such activities are motivated from Shamballa. This activity is set in
motion by these Lives, working on Their high plane, and it gradually causes a reaction in
the various departments of the Hierarchy, particularly those working under third, fifth
and seventh ray Masters. Eventually, disciples upon the physical levels of activity become
aware of the inner ferment, and this happens either consciously or unconsciously. They
become "impressed," and the scientific work is then started and carried through
into the stages of experimentation and final success.
