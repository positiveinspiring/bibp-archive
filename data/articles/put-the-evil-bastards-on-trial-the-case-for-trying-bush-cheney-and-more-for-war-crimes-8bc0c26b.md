# Put the Evil Bastards on Trial - The Case for Trying Bush, Cheney and 
More for War Crimes

As for the legal obligations
involved,
"The torture convention
requires that acts of torture be referred to the
competent authority for the purpose of prosecution,"
Roth said. "The United States has an obligation to
prosecute torture."
Ben Emmerson, the U.N.
special rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights,
agreed.
"The individuals responsible
for the criminal conspiracy revealed in today's report
must be brought to justice, and must face criminal
penalties commensurate with the gravity of their
crimes," he said.
Woven through such calls for the
pursuit of justice, there's a similar subtext: that the
welter of information presented needs to be carefully and
critically sifted through in the light of our highest
values, as well as the principles of international law,
which America has done so much to help create based on those
same values.
"What would it mean to be a
nation committed to the rule of law, if we don't hold
people responsible for crimes of this magnitude?" ACLU
deputy legal director Jameel Jaffer asked on MSNBC.
The need for such action is only
made more urgent by the fact a
new Pew poll shows 56 percent of Americans believe the
lie that torture provided intelligence that helped prevent
terrorist attacks, and related that 51 percent think that,
"the CIA's interrogation
methods
were justified."
As the Intercept's
Dan Froomkin
tweeted,
"If 56 percent of Americans
think 'CIA interrogation' was effective, all that tells
us is that they've been misled,"
adding, "Just like 70 percent of
Americans once though Saddam was behind 9/11, now 56
percent think torture worked. This is a massive
indictment of the U.S. media."
But it's not just the media.
America's entire elite
infrastructure is indicted in this state of affairs, which
is why America so desperately needs to have broad-based,
high-profile torture trials on the model of the Nuremberg
Trials following World War II - trials that will both hold
those responsible accountable for what they've done, and
force the whole nation to engage in a profound moral
reorientation, on the order of what Martin Luther King Jr.
once called for.
This is not an easy path, to be
sure, but it's far easier than decade after decade of
endless war in which America's moral purpose becomes
increasingly lost in the shadows of our own unconfronted
fears.
Al-Qaida's whole aim with
the
9/11 attacks was to draw the U.S. into a self-destructive
conflict in the Middle East, and to expose and exploit our
contradictions. And thanks primarily to the Bush/Cheney
delusional response (and Obama's limited willingness to
alter direction), that's exactly what has happened.
We did not narrowly focus on
bringing those who attacked us to justice.
We swiftly
attacked Afghanistan, short-circuiting any chance of
negotiating to swiftly put bin Laden and his associates on
trial, we then let bin Laden escape, while becoming enmeshed
in Afghan internal conflicts, after which Bush said he was
"truly
not that concerned" about bin Laden.
We then invaded Iraq - which had
nothing to do with 9/11, and was profoundly hostile to
al-Qaida - and set off a series of internal conflicts which
eventuated in the creation of ISIL, which is far more
dangerous and has far more international support than
al-Qaida ever dreamed of.
In short, everything
the U.S. has done since 9/11 has been seriously misguided at
best, and Obama's policy changes have merely trimmed around
the edges of what Bush and Cheney started, because he has
been obsessed with trying to quickly unify the country,
papering over profound differences, rather than facing up to
the genuine deep difficulties of overcoming them.
We saw this, for example, when
he
released a set of torture memos in response to a lawsuit
in April 2009, and said:
This is a time for
reflection, not retribution. I respect the strong views
and emotions that these issues evoke.
We have been through a dark
and painful chapter in our history. But at a time of
great challenges and disturbing disunity, nothing will
be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame
for the past. Our national greatness is embedded in
America's ability to right its course in concert with
our core values, and to move forward with confidence.
That is why we must resist
the forces that divide us, and instead come together on
behalf of our common future.
Just how we were supposed to
"move forward with confidence" without reexamining how we
had gone wrong,
Obama
never bothered to explain.
It would be hard enough were
mere mistakes involved, but we're talking about grave crimes
that undermine the very idea of America - just as al-Qaida
intended when it attacked us on 9/11.
Those mistakes cried out for
correction, but instead
Obama invoked the shameful, discredited Nazi
Nuremberg Defense ("I was only following orders"), when
he said:
In releasing these memos, it
is our intention to assure those who carried out their
duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the
Department of Justice that they will not be subject to
prosecution.
Not only is this an insult to
the real heroes, who spoke out against the barbarism they
were tasked with, the Nuremberg Principles, which came out
of the Nuremberg Trials, explicitly rejected this defense:
Principle IV
The fact that a person acted
pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior
does not relieve him from responsibility under
international law, provided a moral choice was in fact
possible to him.
They also rejected the notion
that those who give the orders are exempt:
Principle III
The fact that a person who
committed an act which constitutes a crime under
international law acted as Head of State or responsible
government official does not relieve him from
responsibility under international law.
These two principles aren't that
hard to grasp, for anyone familiar with TV crime dramas.
Both the hit man and the man who orders the hit are guilty
of murder. Street crimes, suite crimes, international war
crimes - the same logic applies equally to all of them.
As already noted, earlier
reports have already made it clear that crimes were
committed.
The Senate report's greatest value lies in the
light it sheds on competing "theories of the crime" -
explanatory accounts of what happened and why, which are
also familiar from TV crime dramas, particularly ones like
"Law and Order," which got so much mileage out of shifting
and competing theories of the crime, from the initial crime
scene and eyewitness accounts to the final verdict and last
comments made on it.
A theory of the crime creates a context
for understanding how all the different pieces fit together.
It has to make sense in a how-things-work kind of way, what
I've
referred to before as the explanatory mode of "logos,"
but it also serves to make sense by giving them meaning, the
explanatory mode of "mythos."
When 56 percent of Americans say
they believe that torture provided intelligence that helped
prevent terrorist attacks, they're making a claim that
torture worked - which says something both about the
real-world, logos-type effects that were produced,
as well as about the mythos-type nature of what
those engaged in torture were doing.
The need to believe in
the mythos involved routinely trumps the logos side of the
equation.
And yet, on five key points where arguments have
been prominently pushed , evidence in the torture report and
elsewhere clearly contradicts theories of the crime that
would let torturers off the hook - along with those who gave
the orders.
Evidence also suggests several neglected
theories of the crime that provide a profoundly different
view of what our recent history has been - and what our
future could be, by way of contrast.
It
Wasn't About Getting Information
For example, the day before the
Senate torture report was released, national security
blogger/journalist/author
Marcy Wheeler
pointed out it's a mistake to assume that getting
information was the primary aim of torture, by which it
should be judged.
This wasn't just her opinion - it was
actually a matter of record:
As the Senate
Armed Services Committee Report on torture (released
over five years ago, in far less redacted form than
tomorrow's summary will be) makes clear, the Bush regime
embraced torture not for "intelligence" but for
"exploitation."
In December 2001, when DOD first started
searching for what would become torture, it was
explicitly looking for "exploitation."
The term "exploitation" includes
intelligence-gathering, but it also includes spy recruitment
and propaganda - politically useful, often false
information, such as,
"the case of Ibn Sheikh al-Libi, whose torture-induced
claim al Qaeda had ties to Iraq's WMD programs helped
drag us into Iraq," and "Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri [who]
claimed his torturers told him he had to claim Osama bin
Laden had nukes," among others.
When you consider all these
cases, she writes:
Then it raises the really
horrible possibility that Cheney pushed torture because
it would produce the stories he wanted told.
It would be
difficult to distinguish whether Cheney believed this
stuff and therefore that's what the torture produced or
whether Cheney wanted these stories told and that's what
the torture produced.
Difficult, indeed. But either
way, it reminded me of what George Lakoff
told me about the concept of "reflexivity":
It has to do with the fact
that thought is part of the world.
That when you're
thinking, it's not separate from reality, it's part of
reality. And if your understanding of the world is
reflected in what you do, then that thought comes into
the world through your actions.
And then through your
actions, if many people have the same ideas, those ideas
are going to spread, and they're going to come back and
reinforce themselves, because they will change the
world.
This adds another layer to
the theory of the crime that Wheeler draws our attention
to.
Given that conservatives are
much more sensitive to perceived threats in the world,
it's not surprising that reflexivity on their part
creates a more dangerous world, even as they pound their
chests and proclaim their superiority in dealing with
the very dangers they create.
We see the same process at
work with the killers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown
and Eric Garner - the mere presence of a black male
sends them into a panic, even though they're the ones
who are actually armed and dangerous.
This sort of
irrational fear places their behavior outside the
standard of reasonableness on which a justifiable
homicide theory of the crime depends, and the same can
be said about the entire Bush/Cheney response to 9/11,
of which the torture program was just one part.
The lack of discipline,
oversight, reliability and candor that permeated the torture
program, as revealed in the Senate torture report, has been
seen by some as proof that Bush, in particular, was not in
charge, ergo not responsible.
But all that flowed directly
from Bush and Cheney's unhinged response to 9/11 - they were
in control by being out of control, because they couldn't be
otherwise. And - like the killer cops referred to above -
they actively resisted normal processes that would have
curbed their dangerous, deadly excesses.
In a similar abnormal fashion,
Bush even tried to get Congress to authorize going to war
against Iraq without bothering to have the CIA do a national
intelligence estimate, the traditional formal document used
to integrate all the available intelligence data into a
single comprehensive analysis.
"An intelligence official
says that's because the White House doesn't want to detail
the uncertainties that persist about Iraq's arsenal and
Saddam's intentions,"
USA Today reported on Sept. 10, 2002.
In that same forgotten
blockbuster of a story, USA Today reported that the decision
to invade Iraq had been made within weeks of 9/11, but
without any formal decision process:
The decision to target
Saddam "kind of evolved, but it's not clear and neat," a
senior administration official says, calling it
"policymaking by osmosis."
"There wasn't a flash
moment. There's no decision meeting," national security
adviser Condoleezza Rice says.
"But Iraq had been on the
radar screen - that it was a danger and that it was
something you were going to have to deal with eventually
before Sept. 11, because we knew that this was a
problem."
This same mind-set of
panic-driven deliberate carelessness characterized the Bush
administration approach to every major aspect of the war on
terror, making it exceeding difficult to pin down
responsibility for anything - which is precisely the point.
And yet, their responsibility is clear:
Through reflexivity,
Bush and Cheney's unhinged panic drove the entire process
off the rails.
Yet, even today they and their defenders
continue to pretend that they were the tough guys, the
realists, the ones who protected us.
They need to stand
trial in part simply so that this lie can be publicly put to
rest. But the same goes for five points mentioned above, the
five false theories of the crime, which need to be publicly
replaced with their opposites.
The purpose of the sorts of
trials we need is twofold:
-
First, on the logos side, is to
sort through competing theories of the crime, to which hold
up and which do not, and to judge individuals accordingly
-
Second, on the mythos side, is to alter our collective
understanding of the past, so that we can move forward
having learned our lessons deeply, in ways that reshape us
for the better forever
With that in mind, let's consider
each of the different theories of the crime in turn.
First
Theory of the Crime: There was a crime. We tortured people
The first theory of the crime in
any case concerns whether one even occurred.
-
Was something
stolen, or lost?
-
Was a person murdered, or did they commit
suicide?
-
Or die accidentally?
-
In this case, were people
tortured in violation of U.S. and international law?
Many
torture apologists say there was no crime, but there's
already an abundance of evidence to the contrary, even
before the Senate torture report.
The most significant evidence it
provides on this score includes:
-
New details about just
how gruesome the treatment was.
This is captured in
a single summary paragraph from the committee's
finding No. 3 "The interrogations of CIA detainees
were brutal and far worse than the CIA represented
to policymakers and others":
At least five CIA
detainees were subjected to "rectal rehydration" or
rectal feeding without documented medical necessity.
The CIA placed detainees in ice water "baths."
The
CIA led several detainees to believe they would
never be allowed to leave CIA custody alive,
suggesting to one detainee that he would only leave
in a coffin-shaped box.
One interrogator told
another detainee that he would never go to court,
because "we can never let the world know what I have
done to you."
CIA officers also threatened at least
three detainees with harm to their families - to
include threats to harm the children of a detainee,
threats to sexually abuse the mother of a detainee,
and a threat to "cut [a detainee's] mother's
throat."
-
Evidence that CIA
management and lawyers were aware that U.S. law said
one thing, and they were doing another. This began
before they decided to break the law, but had
recurring ripple effects afterward.
In the early
days after 9/11, CIA leadership clearly recognized
the existence of legal limits, which would later be
intentionally set aside [Ex Sum, p 12]:
On September 27, 2001,
CIA Headquarters informed CIA Stations that any
future CIA detention facility would have to meet
"U.S. POW Standards."
In early November
2001, CIA Headquarters further determined that any
future CIA detention facility would have to meet
U.S. prison standards and that CIA detention and
interrogation operations should be tailored to "meet
the requirements of U.S. law and the federal rules
of criminal procedure," adding that "[s]pecific
methods of interrogation w[ould] be permissible so
long as they generally comport with commonly
accepted practices deemed lawful by U.S. courts.
There are others examples of the
second sort, including one cited by Business Insider
here.
But these two passages are sufficient, from a
logos-based point of view, to establish probable cause that
a crime was indeed committed - and not just a single crime,
but a widespread deliberate pattern of them.
Of course there
will still be strong mythos-based resistance, but that's to
be expected - and it's precisely what a Nuremberg-style
trial is for.
Second
Theory of the Crime: Torture Was Not Effective
Despite widespread beliefs to
the contrary revealed in Pew's poll, this is the most
thoroughly proven point of the Senate report.
In her
press release, Sen. Dianne Feinstein wrote that,
"The
study's 20 findings and conclusions can be grouped into four
central themes, each of which is supported extensively in
the Executive Summary," the very first of which was "The
CIA's 'enhanced interrogation techniques' were not
effective."
What's more, the second finding was that we have
been lied to about the effectiveness:
"The CIA provided
extensive inaccurate information about the operation of the
program and its effectiveness to policymakers and the
public."
If the program really were effective, there would
be no need to lie about it, so all the evidence of
misleading the public and policymakers is further evidence
of ineffectiveness as well.
Most significantly, Feinstein
points out,
"The committee reviewed 20 of the most frequent
and prominent examples of purported counterterrorism
'successes' that the CIA has attributed to the use of its
enhanced interrogation techniques. Each of those examples
was found to be wrong in fundamental respects."
This is particularly true of one
of the most widely known claims, that torture was vital in
developing key intelligence about Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti,
Osama bin Laden's courier, the key figure in eventually
locating Osama bin Laden.
This is debunked in a section,
"Information on the Facilitator that Led to the UBL
Operation," from page 378 to 400 in the report (Committee Study of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation
Program).
Feinstein makes several other
key points demolishing the effectiveness claim:
-
There was never a
ticking-time-bomb threat that was thwarted by the
use of torture.
-
Torture "regularly
resulted in fabricated information," which misled
the CIA.
-
CIA officers regularly
questioned the effectiveness of torture.
-
The CIA never adequately
reviewed the effectiveness of torture, "despite a
recommendation by the CIA inspector general to do so
and similar requests by National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice and the leadership of the Senate
Intelligence Committee."
Remember, the pre-trial standard
is probable cause, and with these points the report
establishes probable cause for prosecuting crimes, and
specifically refutes the theory of the crime that the
effectiveness of the methods used justified them, regardless
of how horrific they were.
Those accused may still want to
argue otherwise - but they should do so at trial, not to
avoid it.
Third
Theory of the Crime: Torture Was Not Necessary
From a logos-based point of
view, torture couldn't be necessary if it were ineffective -
unless, of course, the purpose of torture was something else
entirely - as, indeed, we now know it was.
But the naive,
stand-alone claim that torture was necessary, regardless of
whether it was effective in gaining accurate intelligence,
cannot be sustained logically. So there's really no logical
need to discuss evidence related to this claim.
But because it's a prominent
part of the public debate, more is required. We need to
consider the claim as a matter of pure mythos - in terms of
what it may mean to people.
First, we should note that the
claim can have significant psychological appeal,
particularly to those who,
-
feel deeply threatened
-
feel
helpless
-
are psychologically incapable of admitting
their fearfulness and helplessness
Torture may "work"
psychologically for them, and the broader claim that it
worked to stop terrorist attacks is simply an affirmation
that, thanks to torture, they now feel back in control.
Confronting and replacing this element of mythos in our
national psyche is one of the key purposes that
Nuremberg-style trials would serve.
Second, we should note that even
if it were the case that "torture worked" in some cases
(which hasn't been shown) alternatives clearly were
available, which means that it still was not necessary.
As
he has
testified to Congress, then-FBI Agent
Ali Soufan was
getting valuable information using traditional interrogation
techniques when Abu Zubaydah - the first high-value al-Qaida
target - was first captured, before ineffective torture
techniques were begun by the CIA.
Thus, in this very first
case, even if torture had been effective, it still would not
have been proven necessary.
As already noted, there has
never been a ticking-time-bomb threat that was thwarted by
the use of torture - except of course, on Fox's "24,"
where
it happens all the time. This is clearly an extremely
satisfying fantasy for some, and it's not hard to understand
why.
But it is a fantasy - an example of mythos with no
grounding in logos, and one of the main reasons for holding
Nuremberg-style trials is precisely to force us to
relinquish such enticing, but dangerously mistaken
fantasies.
Fourth
Theory of the Crime: Torture Was Carefully Calibrated
The claim of careful calibration
is also, ultimately, logically dependent on the claim of
effectiveness.
Carefully calibrated futility is
still futile, and the fact that it's futile renders the
careful calibration utterly meaningless, if not Monte
Python-style absurd. Still, one could at least argue for
starting out with prudential guidelines of some sort,
regardless of whether they could ultimately be grounded in
any measure of effectiveness.
Perhaps one could be right for
the wrong reason
right?
The moral significance of this
argument is that a calibrated approach to torture would be
evidence of a morally serious purpose, as opposed to
anything from boredom and incompetence to sadism. Add to
that a sincere - though misguided - belief in torture's
effectiveness, and you just might wriggle out of a criminal
charge, claiming a lack of criminal intent.
All that is why it matters that
the CIA's torture program was not carefully
calibrated - and that the CIA lied about it as well.
Indeed, the third of Feinstein's
four main groupings of findings was that "The CIA's
management of the program was inadequate and deeply flawed"
and one of the points under this heading specifically dealt
with severe personnel inadequacies:
The CIA did not employ
adequately trained and vetted personnel. The CIA
deployed individuals without relevant training or
experience.
CIA also deployed officers
who had documented personal and professional problems of
a serious nature - including histories of violence and
abusive treatment of others - that should have called
into question their employment, let alone their
suitability to participate in the sensitive CIA program.
What's more, under Feinstein's
fourth main finding, that "The CIA program was far more
brutal than the CIA represented to policymakers and the
American public," the report directly refutes the
calibration frame:
Records do not support CIA
representations that the CIA initially used an "an open,
non-threatening approach," or that interrogations began
with the "least coercive technique possible" and
escalated to more coercive techniques only as necessary.
Instead, in many cases the
most aggressive techniques were used immediately, in
combination and nonstop. Sleep deprivation involved
keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours, usually
standing or in painful stress positions, at times with
their hands shackled above their heads.
The CIA led several
detainees to believe they would never be allowed to
leave CIA custody alive, suggesting to one detainee that
he would only leave in a coffin-shaped box.
Of course, the accused should be
free to dispute these findings. That's what a trial is for.
But the Senate's findings
clearly contradict the "carefully calibrated" theory of the
crime, and constitute probable cause that criminal conduct
was involved.
Fifth
Theory of the Crime: Torture Was Carried Out in Good Faith
The good faith argument is not
usually made by torture apologists, but it has been made by
President
Obama, as noted above. Beyond running afoul of the
Nuremberg Principles, there's plenty of evidence in the
Senate torture report (Committee Study of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation
Program) that people were not acting in good
faith.
As pointed out above, the CIA
itself was aware from the beginning that there were
standards for it to uphold - standards it would then go on
to violate.
There was also evidence of careless mistreatment
of prisoners, gross mismanagement, lying to Congress,
misleading the White House - the list goes on and on - all
of which is simply incompatible with the notion of people
"acting in good faith."
Again, there may be individuals who
were acting in good faith - although this still
doesn't change the Nuremberg Principles. But the proper
place to sort that out is at trial.
This is yet another case in
which the power of mythos is much stronger than logos. In
particular, mythos often expresses a hunger for heroes,
which is clearly at play here.
In the message cited above,
Obama said:
The men and women of our
intelligence community serve courageously on the front
lines of a dangerous world. Their accomplishments are
unsung and their names unknown, but because of their
sacrifices, every single American is safer.
We must
protect their identities as vigilantly as they protect
our security, and we must provide them with the
confidence that they can do their jobs.
This may be so. Or it may be the
case that our intelligence community is largely responsible
for making it a much more dangerous world than it otherwise
would be.
They certainly made Iran and its environs more
dangerous by helping to
depose the lawfully elected Mosaddegh government back in
1953, and replacing him with the shah, for example.
Still, there are surely many individuals who deserve the
praise Obama offers, whatever our quibbles with the wording. The problem is, by protecting
those who've betrayed our values, Obama is praising
precisely the wrong "heroes."
At the Nation, historian Jon
Weiner wrote a piece
highlighting some of the real heroes of this era, who
are mentioned in the Senate report. One I've already
mentioned - Ali Soufan.
Here's a bit of what Weiner said
about some of the others:
Another hero: Alberto Mora.
As general counsel of the Navy in 2004, Jane Mayer
reported, he
tried to stop the torture program. He told his superiors
at the Pentagon that the Bush torture policy violated
the Geneva Conventions' prohibition of torture and
"outrages upon personal dignity, in particular
humiliating and degrading treatment."
He described the
Bush program as "unlawful" and "dangerous"
Some of the heroes were
ordinary soldiers, like Sgt. Joe Darby, who first
revealed the Abu Ghraib abuses. As a result," Luban points
out, he "had to live under armed protection for six
months."
Others were high officials, like Philip Zelikow,
an adviser to Condoleezza Rice, who, Luban reports,
wrote an "anti-torture memo" that the White House
"attempted to destroy"
Finally we have the case of
Guantánamo prosecutor Lt. Col. Darrel Vandeveld, who
refused to prosecute a teenager who had been abused in
US detention in Afghanistan and Guantánamo.
For that
decision, Jameel Jaffer and Larry Siems
report,
Vandeveld was "barred from the prosecutors' office,
confined to his residence and threatened with dismissal
from the Army."
While there's no doubt that
Nuremberg-style trials would be difficult for us as a
nation, those trials would not be all doom and gloom.
Heroes such as these would also
play a part in the proceedings.
Their voices would be heard,
their stories would be told, their shining examples of
fidelity to America's highest values under the most
difficult of conditions would provide us with exactly the
sort of heroes that we need to write the next chapter of
America's ongoing quest for perfection.
They are the ones who will help
us craft a mythos that's in harmony with the logos of the
underlying facts, not twisted and distorted in direct
contradiction of them.
They are one more powerful
reason that we as a nation need to hold Nuremberg-style
trials - not just to exorcise the demons we have allowed to
grow in our midst, but also to affirm and empower those who
fight against them - and to ensure that their numbers will
grow in the days that lie ahead.
