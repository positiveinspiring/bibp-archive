Synopsis
Superpower: Far from a conspiracy film about the dangers of government
secrets and regime change, this well-balanced film straddles the
philosophical divide and allows viewers to understand the U.S. quest for
global dominance through economic and military strategy that is exposed
through review of historical events, personal interviews, and analysis of U.S.
foreign policy.
The heart of Superpower lies in the analysis produced from a re-examination
of history through a series of interviews with historians, documentarians,
and academians such as,
-
Bill Blum
-
Chalmers Johnson
-
Michel Chossudovsky
-
Noam Chomsky,
...and others with expertise in this subject such as:
-
the
Executive Producer of The Unit, Command Sergeant (Ret.) Eric Haney
-
former
Chief Economist for the US Department of Labor, Morgan Reynolds
-
three-time
Nobel Peace Prize nominee, Kathy Kelly
-
Lt. Col. (Ret) Karen
Kwiatkowski
Examining key moments in America's history elicits a more
consistent and plausible set of motives for US foreign policy actions guided
by global expansion and military dominance, rather than the hyperbolic calls
for democracy and totalitarian regime change that we have become so
accustomed to hearing.
-
Should citizens trust that their government will keep them safe, a
government that keeps secrets, and lies, in the name of national security?
-
Does the simple act of withholding information lead to a world of
eroding
civil liberties and corruption?
Superpower presents a view of US foreign
policy, which lies in stark contrast to that depicted by corporate media,
popular pundits, and US heads of state.
With the fall of the Soviet Union,
the US has emerged as the preeminent superpower of the world. Superpower
illustrates how the United States has chosen to leverage that position to
pursue a grand strategy which will ensure itself unilateral world domination
through absolute economic and military superiority. It shows a consistent
pattern of government deception.
The United States emerged from World War II with its industrial base still
intact and the only nation with the atomic bomb. It was without question the
most powerful country on earth.
What was done with this unprecedented power,
the effects it's had on our Republic and the rest of the world is the story
of "Superpower."
