Last June, Glenn Greenwald at
The Guardian
revealed that Edward Snowden was the NSA insider behind,
"one of the most significant leaks in US
political history."
Snowden explained his motivations through
Greenwald by saying,
"There are more important things than
money
harming people isnt my goal. Transparency is."
Such altruistic motivations were welcome news at
the time but have come into question recently given that only a tiny
fraction of the documents have been released nearly a year after Snowden
started working with Greenwald.
Perhaps more importantly, billionaire Pierre
Omidyar is funding Greenwalds slow release of those documents. It is
worth noting that Omidyars Paypal Corporation has links to the NSA.
It was originally reported that the number of
documents Snowden had stolen
was in the thousands. Today, however, that number is
said to be nearly two million.
This calls into question Snowdens early
statement, as reported by Greenwald, that he,
"carefully evaluated every single document
to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest."
The huge, new number also reveals that less than
one tenth of one percent of the documents (only about 900) have actually
been released to the public.
How could Snowden have "carefully evaluated
every single" one of what is now being said to be nearly two million
documents? He only worked for
Booz Allen Hamilton for a few months.
According to NSA Director Keith Alexander,
Snowden also worked directly for NSA for twelve months prior to that, which
is interesting. But still, that would require carefully evaluating thousands
of documents a day during that entire time.
Didnt he have a job apart from that?
Journalist Margie Burns
asked some
good questions back in June that have not yet been answered. She wondered
about the 29-year old Snowden who had been a U.S. Army Special Forces
recruit, a covert CIA operative, and an NSA employee in various capacities,
all in just a few, short years.
Burns asked,
"How, exactly, did Snowden get his series of
NSA jobs?
Did he apply through regular channels? Was
it through someone he knew? Who recommended him? Who were his references
for a string of six-figure, high-level security jobs?
Are there any safeguards in place so that
red flags go up when a subcontractor jumps from job to job, especially
in high-level clearance positions?"
Five months later, journalists
Mark Ames and Yasha Levine
investigated some of the businesses in which
Greenwalds benefactor Omidyar had invested.
They found that the actual practices of those
businesses were considerably less humanitarian than the outward appearance
of Omidyars ventures often portray. The result was that Omidyar took down
references to at least one of those businesses from his website.
In December, whistleblower Sibel Edmonds
broke the news that Omidyars
Paypal Corporation was implicated in the as-yet-unreleased NSA documents
from Snowden.
Moreover, Edmonds had allegedly been contacted
by an NSA official who alleged that,
"a deal was made in early June, 2013 between
the journalists involved in this recent NSA scandal and U.S. government
officials, which was then sealed by secrecy and nondisclosure agreements
by all parties involved."
It would appear that Snowdens whistleblowing
has been co-opted by private corporate interests.
Are those involved with privatization of the
stolen documents also colluding with government agencies to frame and direct
national discussions on domestic spying and other serious matters?
The possibilities are endless, it seems.
Presenting documents at a measured rate could be a way to acclimate citizens
to painful realities without stirring the public into a panic or a unified
response that might actually threaten the status quo.
And considering that the number of documents has
somehow grown from only thousands to nearly two million, it seems possible
that those in control could release practically anything, thereby
controlling national dialogue on many topics.
We live in an age of information war. It does
not serve the public interest well to ignore that fact at any time based on
pre-conceived notions of what corporations, governments or journalists are
capable of.
Lets hope that Greenwald, who has done some
good work revealing government misconduct, will immediately release all of
the stolen documents, speak to the claims of an alleged deal made with
government officials, and admit the risks with regard to Omidyar and his
Paypal colleagues.
