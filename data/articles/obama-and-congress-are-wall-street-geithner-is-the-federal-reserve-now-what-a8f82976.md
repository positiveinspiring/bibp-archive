Real change won't come
by giving more power
or money to this group - Dees Illustration
Barack Obama and his 2008 presidential
challenger John McCain both received more money from Wall Street donors than
their combined lifetime government salaries.
It was a billion-dollar-plus campaign.
In fact,
all of Congress makes more from Wall Street and corporate campaign
contributions than their public salaries. It is the nature of the modern
political system. And Timothy Geithner, despite cheating on his own
taxes, was plucked from the New York
Federal Reserve to serve as U.S.
Treasury Secretary.
So who can the People turn to for solutions?
-
Some very well-meaning people have
suggested apparent solutions to alleviate some of these challenges.
-
Some have called for a separation of
money and politics.
-
Some have called for ending the Federal
Reserve System.
-
Some have suggested a complete write-off
of all fraudulent debt.
-
Some want higher taxes imposed on the
well-to-do.
-
Some demand more free government
services like healthcare and higher education.
-
Some say ending the wars at home and
abroad will be the cure-all.
Each of these proposed solutions seem to have
some attraction, but they also have flaws that need to be addressed.
Remove Money from
Politics
In theory the separation of money from politics
makes sense.
Some have put forward the idea of publicly
financed campaigns, which would certainly level the playing field for
everyday citizens to compete in elections against generations of elite
public servants. However, this theory is much like
the failed
'war on drugs'
-
if there is a demand for something, there will always be a supply no matter
how many walls are built.
If there is a demand for corporate influence on
policy, their money will always find a way over those walls.
They may buy direct advertising to advocate for
a certain policy, or simply buy unaccountable government regulators to do
their dirty work - both of which already occur.
End the Fed
Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who is widely
respected as one of the only champions of the people and the Constitution
left in government, suggests absorbing the Federal Reserve Bank into the
U.S. Treasury to print and spend interest-free money into the economy.
Although this may be one of the best short-term
solutions, Geithner and the executive branch will then control the issuance
of currency. Although they are more accountable to the People, they still
represent the status quo where the same cabal will likely benefit.
Similarly, presidential candidate Ron Paul wants
to end The Fed, but first by legalizing competing currencies so that no
single entity wields power over the issuance of money.
Presently, either of these actions would be a
huge step forward in resolving our current bondage to debt-based monopoly
money, but they are still merely just the beginning of reform.
Complete Debt
Forgiveness
I have been one of the advocates for a complete
write-off of all fraudulent debt, essentially hitting the economic reset
button.
This act would zap all of the power that the
banking cartel has over governments and individuals. Although I truly
believe this to be the only way out of this mess, it may require an entirely
new free and fair financial structure in place when the button is pushed, or
the same group of thugs will likely maintain their control over the system.
A new,
-
monetary policy
-
banking system
-
credit
rules
-
stock exchange,
...would have to emerge for such a reset to be
effective.
Perhaps an Economic Constitution is needed to lay the framework
first.
Tax the Rich
Those calling for higher taxes on the wealthy
may have their heart in the right place, but this is perhaps the worst of
the proposed solutions.
This will change nothing fundamental about the
system that enslaves the peasants. Secondly, at this point, who could trust
the legislation to only target the elite who hide their assets offshore
anyway? And, pragmatically, increasing taxes on the rich won't even make a
dent in the astronomical national debt, future obligations, or even current
expenditures.
Taxing the rich will not create long-term jobs
or solve the problem of how the money is created or spent.
More short-term
tax revenue may only encourage,
Notably, taxing short-term speculative Wall
Street trades (some version of the Tobin tax) seems to have some validity.
But in the end, this just gives more money to a
disgustingly corrupt government which will still be heavily influenced by
big corporations.
Free Education and
Healthcare
Understandably, it only seems fair that if
society can produce untold trillions for war and bailouts of fraudulent
industries, there should be enough money to educate and maintain the health
of its citizens.
Still, free healthcare and education has become
synonymous with socialism in our modern society because money must be taken
by force from someone else to pay for these "free" services. Sure, in a
perfect society one should have the equal freedom to pursue any level of
education based on desire and ability without concern for cost.
And certainly, no one should die or go bankrupt
because they lack adequate healthcare.
However, this ultimately becomes a
question about the role of government, and the Constitution currently does
not give the authority to provide for such services. Then again, it also
doesn't allow for undeclared wars and corporate bailouts either.
No matter what it will be called, or how it will
be paid for, until society determines that the health and education of its
populace is of utmost importance, it will remain an ill society.
An entirely new system may need to be dreamed up
for this to work for everyone.
End the Wars
Yes, yes, and yes. End the foreign wars. End the
phony "war on terror". And end the war on drugs.
They only benefit those funding the wars (with
interest) and the pirates who the government gives the spoils to. Because no
average citizen ever wants war, it leads some to believe that all wars have
been baited by these beneficiaries - and they wouldn't be wrong.
Unfortunately, for too long we have taken the bait and they have gotten
their spoils. It is time to stop this insanity.
Significantly, this is one of the only practical
solutions that will have minimal blowback. It will save trillions in public
spending and immediately bring more harmony to the planet. However, America
will face the very real challenge of creating new employment for returning
soldiers, contractors, and laid-off weapons manufacturers, as well as DEA
agents, prison guards and others who participate in perpetuating the war on
drugs.
So, even though ending all wars is the only sane
policy, by itself it is not a silver bullet for economic woes.
Indeed, these are exciting and transformative times, and the People will
eventually get what they ask for. However, they must be careful in what they
ask for because the same power structures that they're currently protesting
may ultimately end up with more power.
Unless, of course, part of the solution is to
remove the corporate state's power to coerce people in the first place.
Therefore, a good place to start may be to demand more personal freedom
while curbing the rights of multinational corporations and the government
itself.
Regardless, the enormity of the problems require that many groundbreaking
proposals are put forward and examined.
