Q: Tell me more about the
shape shifting part, please. I have heard
about this elsewhere, and this not just occurring during rituals,
some people claim to have seen politicians shapeshift, for instance.
When you say 'demonic' are you talking about a specific 'demon' or
type of demon? Is it possible that these demons are really nothing
more than some type of ETs influencing the Illuminati, in turn
deceiving them?
A: Since you asked about shape shifting, I will share a little more,
but it also relates directly to my own belief system. Can't help it,
so I will warn you here that I will be discussing fundamental
Christianity and the demonic.
After being raised in a group that glorifies the demonic, I became a
Christian years ago. I honestly believe that without faith in Jesus
Christ, I could NEVER have gotten out of the Illuminati, and one
reason I don't fear for my life when I share what I remember is that
I believe that God is able to protect me.
His love is the antithesis of the cruelty and evil that I saw in
this group. His compassion and infinite caring and purity the
opposite of the sexual abuse and darkness that surrounded the
rituals. I believe that God has forgiven my past, I have sincerely
asked His forgiveness, or I could not live with the memories of what
I did to others (such as getting young girls addicted to drugs, so
they would prostitute for the cult, as only one example).
I have renounced that lifestyle, given it up, and only Christianity
has shown me the love and forgiveness and healing that I have needed
for a soul weary beyond belief after seeing the underbelly of life
and the cruelty that human beings are capable of showing to others.
In the occult world, I do believe that there are demons, that they
are real, and that they have a spiritual hierarchy that the cult
hierarchy attempts to emulate on a physical plane.
There are principalities, and lower demons, and they control the
portals into other spiritual dimensions that humans have NO BUSINESS
entering. This stuff is destructive in the extreme to people.
The shape shifting was usually in the context of an occult ceremony,
by those given completely over to the demonic. Humans took on the
form of animals for a period of time, or of hideous looking beings,
and they were NOT aliens. This was demonic activity that caused a
human to see the demonic revealed, and distorted what they saw.
I have seen people go temporarily "blind" because of the demonic
influence. I have seen animals psychically killed, by others coming
into a circle and directing their "energy" at the animal. These were
not aliens, some of them were people I grew up with, and my own
mother (she was strange, but not an alien).
I participated in this as well at times, and I'm no alien, just a
wounded human being. I believe that the demonic does have sexual
relations with humans, because it is recorded in the Bible
(Genesis); God also forbids it as being completely wrong.
In fact, the Biblical covenants are the antithesis of the dark
covenants practiced by the Illuminati, and I have found a lot of
healing by going to Scripture and seeing how God views our world,
and how He deals with the Spiritual realm. He is going to win, and
is in the process of winning the battle.
I will share with you a dream I had 2 years ago. I was standing in a
large room, circular shaped, with tiers of rows. A large emblem of
the world with a wreath above it was on the wall, and robed figures
surrounded me. I was before the Supreme World Council (who will rule
when the
NWO comes in), and they were pointing at me and saying I
was a traitor and would have to die.
The sense of darkness and oppression in the room was intolerable, I
was choking from it. One of the leaders came forward, and said that
I would die a traitor's death, as an example to them all, unless I
came back into the fold of "family".
I fought the dark impulse to give in to save my life, then in my
mind, cried out "Jesus, save me". Instantly, the love and peace of
God filled my heart, I was no longer afraid, and I told him, "No,
because you are defeated, you just don't realize it. You can kill my
body, but I serve a God who has defeated you and everyone in this
room."
I woke up at this point, filled with joy. Now you know why I don't
mind answering questions about my past. I believe in a God who is
greater than the plans of evil men. They can plot all they want, but
in the end, their plans will be defeated.
So ask away, any time, and I will share with you all that I
remember. I don't mind exposing them, although I do have a lot of
cynicism, as I have noted, as to whether people will do anything
about it.
While I respect your desire to investigate, and your openness to any
possibilities, I can tell you that as a former lifetime member of
the group, I saw demons acting, not reptiles or aliens. I would
really wonder about aliens who were as vicious and against Biblical
Christianity in particular as the demons I saw.
