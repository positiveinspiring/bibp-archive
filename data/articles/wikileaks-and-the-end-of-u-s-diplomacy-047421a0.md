WikiLeaks is again publishing a trove of documents, in this case
classified U.S. State Department diplomatic cables.
The whistle-blower website will gradually be
releasing more than 250,000 of these documents in the coming months so that
they can be analyzed and gain the attention they deserve. The cables are
internal, written communications among U.S. embassies around the world and
also to the U.S. State Department.
WikiLeaks described the leak as,
the largest set of confidential documents
ever to be released into the public domain [giving] an unprecedented
insight into U.S. government foreign activities.
Critics argue, as they did with earlier leaks of
secret documents regarding Iraq and Afghanistan, that lives will be lost as
a result.
Rather, lives might actually be saved, since the
way that the U.S. conducts diplomacy is now getting more exposure than ever
- as is the apparent ease with which the U.S. government lives up (or down)
to the adage used by pioneering journalist I.F. Stone:
Governments lie.
Take the case of Khaled El-Masri.
El-Masri was snatched in Macedonia as part of
the CIAs secret extraordinary rendition program, in which people are taken
by the U.S. government and sent to other countries, where they can be
subjected to torture. He was held and tortured in a secret prison in
Afghanistan for months before being dropped by
the CIA
on an isolated road in Albania, even though the CIA had long established
that it had grabbed the wrong man.
El-Masri, a German citizen, sought justice
through German courts, and it looked like 13 CIA agents might be charged.
Then the U.S. Embassy in Berlin stepped in,
threatening, according to one cable, that,
issuance of international arrest warrants
would have a negative impact on our bilateral relationship.
No charges were ever filed in Germany,
suggesting the diplomatic threat worked.
The 13 agents are, however, still facing charges
in Spain, where prosecutors enjoy some freedom from political pressures. Or
so we thought...
In fact, Spain figures prominently in the leaked
documents as well. Among the cables is one from May 14, 2007, authored by
Eduardo Aguirre, a conservative Cuban-American banker appointed U.S.
ambassador to Spain by
George W. Bush.
Aguirre wrote:
For our side, it will be important to
continue to raise the Couso case, in which three U.S. servicemen face
charges related to the 2003 death of Spanish cameraman Jose Couso during
the battle for Baghdad.
Couso was a young cameraman with the Spanish TV
network Telecinco.
He was filming from the balcony of the Palestine
Hotel in Baghdad on April 8, 2003, when a U.S. Army tank fired on the hotel
packed with journalists, killing Couso and a Reuters cameraman. Ambassador
Aguirre was trying to quash the lawsuit brought by the Couso family in
Spain.
The U.S. ambassador was also pressuring the Spanish government to drop a
precedent-setting case against former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
and other Bush administration officials.
In that same memo, Aguirre writes,
The Deputy Justice Minister also said the
GOS [government of Spain] strongly opposes a case brought against former
Secretary Rumsfeld and will work to get it dismissed. The judge involved
in that case has told us he has already started the process of
dismissing the case.
These revelations are rocking the Spanish
government, as the cables clearly show U.S. attempts to disrupt the Spanish
justice system.
Ambassador Aguirre told Spains El Pais newspaper several years ago,
I am George Bushs plumber, I will solve
all the problems George gives me.
In another series of cables, the U.S. State
Department instructs its staff around the world and at the U.N. to spy on
people, and, remarkably, to collect biometric information on diplomats.
The cable reads,
Data should include e-mail addresses,
telephone and fax numbers, fingerprints, facial images, DNA and iris
scans.
WikiLeaks is continuing its partnership with a
global group of media outlets:
David Leigh, investigations editor of The
Guardian, told me,
We havent seen anything yet, with
literally almost a quarter-million cables still not publicly revealed.
A renowned political analyst and linguist, MIT
professor
Noam Chomsky helped Daniel Ellsberg,
Americas premier whistle-blower, release the Pentagon Papers 40 years ago.
I
asked Chomsky about the latest cables released by WikiLeaks.
What this reveals, he reflected, is the
profound hatred for democracy on the part of our political leadership.
