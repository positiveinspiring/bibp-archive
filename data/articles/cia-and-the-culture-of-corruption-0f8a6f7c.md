Last month, the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA)
released a blistering report that documented a secret drug interdiction
program in Peru that was responsible for the death of an American missionary
and her infant daughter in 2001.
The report provided a detailed study of the
efforts of senior CIA leaders, including Deputy Director John McLaughlin
and Deputy Executive Director John Brennan, to cover up Agency
malfeasance, stonewalling the White House, the Congress and the Department
of Justice (DOJ) on the flaws of the interdiction program.
Brennan, who was President Obama's original
choice to be CIA director until the report complicated the confirmation
process, is currently the deputy director of the National Security
Council (NSC).
McLaughlin was the "villain" in the politicization of intelligence on Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction, according to the chief of the Iraq Survey
Group, David Kay.
Few people remember that it was McLaughlin who
actually delivered the "slam-dunk" briefing to the president in January
2003. Nevertheless, the Obama administration named McLaughlin to lead the
internal investigation of the CIA's intelligence failures in the attempted
bombing of a commercial airliner and the shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, in
2009.
The detailed report on Peru documents a culture of corruption and deceit at
the highest levels of the CIA as well as the interventions of CIA lawyers to
stop the DOJ from pursuing prosecutions in the case.
The CIA office of general counsel's aggressive
campaign to prevent a criminal prosecution of the agency officers culminated
with Deputy Director McLaughlin's letter to the assistant attorney general
that promised,
"significant disciplinary action" if CIA
officers "lied or made knowingly misleading statements" to the Congress,
DOJ, the NSC or office of inspector general (OIG)
investigators.
The report carefully documents the lies and the
stonewalling, but no "significant disciplinary action" has ever been taken.
The CIA tried to present the 2001 shootdown as an anomaly in an otherwise
successful program. In fact, the inspector general (IG) report documents
procedural failures in all 15 shootdowns that the CIA was involved in
between 1995 and 2001. There were no examples of full compliance with
intercept procedures in any of the shootdowns.
CIA officers knew of and condoned the
violations, which formed an,
"environment of negligence and disregard for
procedures," according to the report.
Violations of procedures required to intercept
and shootdown drug trafficking aircraft occurred in all 15 shootdowns in
which the CIA participated.
CIA personnel in Peru provided inaccurate
statements reporting that all required procedures had been conducted,
high-level agency officials endorsed these reports and they were passed to
Congress and the NSC.
In many cases, suspect aircraft were shot down
within minutes of being sighted by Peruvian fighter aircraft, without being
properly identified, without being given required warnings and without being
given time to respond to warnings. Visual signals were not even conducted in
the 11 shootdowns that occurred in daylight.
Agency officers and lawyers forwarded inaccurate information to senior
agency managers as well as to Congress and the NSC.
The office of general counsel specifically
advised the Peru Task Force not to report findings dealing with malfeasance.
Agency lawyers violated their legal obligations as US attorneys by making
sure that reports of violations did not appear in any formal report and,
therefore, could not be provided to the Senate intelligence committee, the
NSC and the DOJ.
Even CIA Director George Tenet provided incomplete and misleading
briefings to the Congress in testimony that was reviewed by John Moseman,
the director's chief of staff and John Rizzo, the deputy general
counsel.
The failure of the CIA to keep Congress and the
NSC fully informed of the program violated the agency's legal obligations.
The family of the 2001 victims received $8
million from the US government on the basis of the false assertion that the
missionary shootdown was an aberration in a,
"program that otherwise had complied with
presidentially-mandated procedures."
The Peru report in 2008 as well as IG reports on
renditions and detentions in 2004 and the 9/11 study in 2006 created great
animosity toward the OIG within the CIA.
Senior members of the National Clandestine
Service and the Office of General Counsel were infuriated by the independent
and hard-hitting IG investigations. They convinced CIA director General
Michael Hayden to weaken the role of the OIG. Hayden directed his
special counsel to conduct oversight of the IG's work.
This action violated the law that created the
statutory IG in 1989 and ignored procedures that were in place to examine
the work of the IG.
The unwillingness to pursue failures and to hold senior officials
accountable have been part of a larger pattern of corruption over the past
three decades. There were a series of phony intelligence assessments
prepared by the CIA in the 1980s, including a tailored report linking the
Soviet Union to the attempted assassination of the pope in 1981, for which
there was no accountability. (The leader of this campaign to politicize
intelligence on the Soviet Union currently serves as President Obama's
secretary of defense.)
There were specious documents prepared in 2002
and 2003 to pave the way for the use of force in Iraq, including a National
Intelligence Estimate and an unclassified white paper, once again without
accountability. In fact, the authors of these reports had their careers
advanced, while occasional critics were marginalized.
Sadly, President
Obama has totally abandoned his
campaign commitment to accountability.
He has refused to take any action on
accountability for torture and abuse, and his administration has refused to
pursue legal action against the CIA for the destruction of the tapes that
documented the sadistic behavior of CIA employees and contractors.
The CIA officer most responsible for the
destruction of the tapes, Jose Rodriquez Jr., said that it would be
less damaging to destroy the tapes than to allow them to be seen. Rodriquez,
who successfully fought a subpoena to testify before the House intelligence
committee, could not have been more right.
Clearly, President Obama is following in the footsteps of many of his
predecessors, who simply hoped to control controversy at the CIA by failing
to address problems directly. His early admonition that he would look
forward and not backward has certainly been applied to the CIA.
This approach has not worked well in the past
and will fail in the end.
As a constitutional lawyer, President Obama must
realize that the stature of international law is diminished when a nation
violates it with impunity and that the stature of a nation is diminished
when it commits crimes against humanity.
