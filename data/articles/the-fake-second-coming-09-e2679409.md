Australian Alien Bases
THE AMERICAN BASE IN
ANTARCTICA
The secret American Antarctic Base is an integral part of America's network
and linked via satellite to Pine Gap and other bases in Australia,
Christchurch in New Zealand, Punta Arenas in Southern Chile and the long
standing C.I.A./NSA base in Cape Town, South Africa according the the
Fortress Australia writer.
Large trenches were mined in which buildings were placed in neat rows, then covered with now deep ice and snow, due to the natural ice build up. Due to the large airspaces in the trenches, now tunnels, the ambient temperature of the air was raised to above freezing level without effecting the surrounding ice. This combined with the individual heated buildings make it a comfortable place to live.
The main purpose of the base appears to be top secret experimentation in the area of electromagnetism and the earth's magnetic field. An Australian scientist with the Southern Lights research team at the main Australian Antarctic Base, situated at Mawson told the author about American activities there. He said that when they conducted their regular experiments, big changes occurred in the Aurora and communications were effected.
He believed they were driving electromagnetic energy into the
earth's magnetic field which was causing the disruption in the Aurora and
probably related to the HAARP experiments in Alaska as the effects on the
Northern Lights were similar.
HAS HUBBLE SEEN AN ALIEN INVASION OF HUGE MAGNITUDE?
According to the Fortress Australia article the Tidbinbilla tracking
station, jointly established between UK, USA and Australia close to Canberra
is the most important in Australia. It is a vital control center for the
Hubble orbital telescope. The first images received by Tidbinbilla found
that virtually every star has a solar system. The truth angered the American
control-room staff that the Australians and British now knew.
Hubble now operates satisfactorily and photographs are airbrushed before release. The Parks Radio telescopes according to a government source first detected intelligent signals from outer space more than twenty five years ago. It has been involved with the SETI program. Parks hit rate was alarmingly high so the plug had to be pulled in 1995 before too much leaked out. Intelligent radio and television signals were identified in several parts of the galaxy and emanating from areas up to three thousand light years away from the earth.
It's classified above top secret that technical civilizations equal or superior to our own were very active more than three thousand years ago. They captured enhanced television pictures showing the daily life of a number of alien civilizations of ages past and still do. NSA has close co-operation with Parks and has liaison staff posted there on a full time basis, as an outpost of the NSA's vital intelligence gathering network. Nothing is sure, only that obvious and massive preparations are being made to protect and secure the Australian continent from a cataclysmic event. No doubt time will tell.
The Fortress Australia author would like to mention that as far as possible the information contained in this report was checked and where possible attempts were made to verify it. However it has to be borne in mind that some information may contain some inaccuracies due to the impossibility of verifying source material. Never-the-less the author considers the majority of the information well founded and truthful.
It
should also be pointed out that many of the providers of this information
required their identities to be covered in such a way that they could not be
identified. This involved some minor alterations to the narrative to produce
such cover and has not compromised the information described in any way. Rumors have persisted in Australia that all the initial SDI experiments and
developments were successful and a large part of the system is fully
operated and controlled by America's secret Australian and Antarctic bases.
TRACKING DEEP SPACE ACTIVITIES?
It has been said that the real secret is in Canberra, not Alice Springs at
the Tidbinbilla tracking station, outside Canberra. Which, besides
controlling and tracking military satellites is also involved in deep space
vehicle control. CDSCC is responsible for the tracking of spacecraft that
partake in interplanetary missions.
The Complex is a NASA facility operated under a USA-Australian Government agreement which involves JPL, CSIRO Australia and British Aerospace Australia. Reports coming in from Tidbinbilla, by someone who worked there, were on weather control, UFOs, killer satellites and much more. There is a huge high-tech James Bond type operation hub in Canberra.
There is a rumored system called the
Deakin
Exchange which is the grown up big brother of
Echelon, and not under the NRO.
PINE GAP FOR THE ELITE AFTER THE STOCK MARKET CRASH.
Dr. Gille writes that several times, locals have seen white disks about 30'
in diameter being unloaded from large US cargo planes at the airports
serving Pine Gap with the USAF emblem on them. It seems likely that disks
are assembled and based at Pine Gap because many disks seen at night would
confirm this. Much furniture has been delivered by plane from the United
States.
The locals also say that an enormous amount of food is stocked in warehouses of what could well be a true multi-leveled underground city. Dr. Gille writes that shares put on the market at the same time will cause a stock market crash of such magnitude that all the national economies of the West will collapse at the same time. Cash will worthless and the risks of a global confrontation (planned!) will be high.
The purpose of Pine Gap and other underground bases purpose will become obvious. If a global confrontation is going to break out, those bases will serve as a place of safety for the politicians and their staff, as well as the international financiers, their family and friends. Plastic cards will be necessary, there will be abolishment of all ownership rights and and the setting up of a World Government that will 'ensure peace'. The underground bases will make possible the disappearance of those who do not conform.
There are already many concentration camps. Our new "Masters' will end up saying they have the aliens support, and that we are on the eve of a golden age and it will be the worst dictatorship ever known to mankind according to Dr. Gille. William Cooper says all the CIA Directors and Secretaries of State were all members of the Council on Foreign Relations and also the MJ-12, which includes Kissinger.
They rule US. George Bush, former CIA director was called upon by
the committee to smuggle the drugs in through his off-shore oil platforms
in
1955 as there are no customs on these. The secret government kill America's
children for the alien projects with their agreements with alien nations to
rule the world jointly. They can make US currency worthless at any time and
bring everyone under control with their global credit card.
WHAT ELSE IS AT PINE GAP ?
Stan Deyo also asks if Pine Gap could be a man-made city of multiple levels,
used to shelter key U.S. personnel in the event of some disaster. Among some
of the major contractors and suppliers for Pine Gap have been Collins Radio,
McMahon Construction, L.T.V. aero-space company, a conglomerate of
electronics and aircraft manufacturing subsidiaries and I.B.M.
Stan says it is rumored that there are super IBM computer systems on a floating platform, 'down the well' underneath the facility. IBM has mammoth computers which can recognize both voice and visual patterns. Their main memory sizes are said to be in excess of 2,000,000,000 bytes. The first 2 antennas for controlling and communicating with satellites were constructed in 1966-67. Pine Gap became operational in 1970. In 1974 unauthorized photos and other information from inside the faculty are reported to have been sold to Russia.
In 1991 Pine Gap is instrumental in tracking Iraqi SCUD missiles, with satellite imagery tracking the Iraqi troops. By 1996 witnesses saw a triangular craft crash or land rapidly at an area west of Pine Gap. Diane Harrison of the Australasian Ufologist magazine wrote a good description of Pine Gap and says there are now about 18 satellite control antennas, making it one of the largest satellite control stations in the world for satellites parked in fixed orbits above the equator.
The most recent satellites are 300 feet diameter. They intercept signals in the VHF, UHF and millimeter wave frequency bands. Within that frequency there are 4 categories of signals. The first category monitors signals transmitted in the course of advanced weapons development, particularly ballistic missiles.
The first satellites
were designed for this and monitored Russian missile development programs
and now monitors other countries. The newer satellites are now primarily for
the Soviet Union. This intelligence is shared.
THE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF PINE GAP
The second category monitors signals from large radars, including ones
associated with anti-ballistic missile fields. air defense radars, radars on
ships. Analysis of this tells lot about the capabilities of those
anti-missile and anti-aircraft systems in the various air defense fields
around the globe. Thirdly intercepting the communications of other satellite
systems, i.e. communications which are going up from ground to communication
satellites which are also based in fixed orbits.
Listening satellites parked close to the communications satellites. Finally they monitor a wide range of other microwave emissions on the earth's surface including: long distance phone calls transmitted via terrestrial microwave circuits enabling them to monitor military, political and government agencies or private individuals.
Diane says that a satellite can be parked over the interior of a country and intercept the microwave emissions coming from it. The satellites are under the control of the CIA, who in turn answer to the NRO (National Reconnaissance Office).
There are 8 large radomes, that cover the the antenna arrays which keeps sand etc. away and conceal the antenna's position from enemy spy satellites. There are a wide range of communication devices: HF radio, underground cable, telstra telephone and telex, 2 satellites communication terminals to occupy the on average 1,200 staff. The staff have to wear color coded ID to match the color ribbons running along the walls.
US Military Airlift Command carry thousands of tapes home for further study
and send parts and supplies twice weekly. There are direct links from Pine
Gap to the US bases in the Philippines, Guam, Krugerdorp South Africa and
the
Amundsen-Scott base at the South Pole
THE PINE GAP COMPUTER ROOM
The computer room is almost 5,600 meters and the operators use headsets to
communicate. Within the central operations building at Pine Gap people are
keeping the satellite and its antenna focused on the signals they are
intercepting. Then other staff process the enormous volume of interpreted
signals. Then the signals are analyzed for intelligence data.
Up to 1980 Australians were not allowed access to the voice intercepts, coming into the signal analysis section. But now they have full access to all areas except the cryptographic room, officially anyway. Univac computers encrypt transmissions, including voices and these go to Redondo Beach in California. About 25 to 30 messages are sent from Pine Gap each day to US and about half go to the CIA headquarters in Langley Virginia.
Though occasionally data is sent directly to the NRO Headquarters in the Pentagon, or to the NSA headquarters at Fort Meade Maryland. Diane writes that there is a group called the Joint Reconnaissance Schedule committee, who meet each morning to decide who is going to be listened to for the next 24 hours to focus the antennas on the satellites. e.g. who is doing a missile test, or if a political crisis occurs somewhere.
Australians are involved in this. In the
90's there has been a need to collect political intelligence on allies and
to also download economic intelligence from these countries. In a reprint
from Conspiracy Nation Alan Howard wrote that Pine Gap has many, many levels
below the basement, like the Pentagon and the White House.
THE TOP BRASS AT PINE GAP
The computer room at Pine Gap when it was new was one of the biggest
computer rooms in the world, it has now tripled in size. There are said to
be over 1,000 staff. A similar station to Pine Gap is located in South
Africa with 1,200 staff. It like Pine Gap is also linked to another VLF
station at the South Pole.
Dr. Gille writes that Pine Gap has enormous computers connected to US, Krugersdorp South Africa, Guam, Canberra, Antarctica US base counterparts, which collect information from these countries, about finance, technology, and everything about the average citizen.
The Amundsen-Scott base at the South Pole is located on a sensitive magnetic spot of our planet, in that it holds exactly the same assets as Pine Gap, and that all the information about most of the average citizens of Western Europe is stored there in memory banks tens of meters under the icepack. Canberra computers were connected to all banks, every post office, all telephones, all police stations and customs houses, every arrival and departure desk for air or sea travelers and to the other data centers collecting data on private citizens in the United States and Europe.
Peter Sawyer, a former high-ranking Australian civil servant found out that all data about every citizen of the Western World ends up being stored. All financial, economic, political and military information. The president of the Rockefeller Foundation supervised in person the construction of 20 luxury residences in Canberra, which is meant to accommodate the world government-to-be and the 20 luxury residences will be allocated to the different foreign members of that government.
The Australian premier, Bob Hawk, was a Rhodes scholar, and as such he worked toward the setting up of a One World Government.
