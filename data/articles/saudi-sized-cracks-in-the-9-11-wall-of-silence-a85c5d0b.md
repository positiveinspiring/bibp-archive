President Obama is apparently thinking about his
presidential library. So now might be a good time to ponder whether anyone
will want to visit it.
If he cared about revivifying his brief
reputation as a good-guy outsider ready to shine light on the hidden
recesses of our governing apparatus (remember his election-night victory
speech that brought tears and rare hope to America?), Obama could certainly
start at this late date by taking a stand for transparency.
Here's how:
Two Congressmen, a Democrat and a
Republican, are asking Obama to declassify the congressional report on
9/11, which the Bush administration heavily redacted.
The two members of the House of
Representatives have read the blacked-out portions, including 28 totally
blank pages that deal largely with Saudi government ties to the alleged
9/11 hijackers.
This is apparently major connect-the-dots
stuff - much more significant than what one may remember from Michael
Moore's film Fahrenheit 911, about Saudi royals and other Saudis
studying and living in the US, who were allowed to go home without being
interviewed in the aftermath of the attacks.
This is about actual financial and
logistical support of terrorism against the United States - by its ally,
the Saudi government.
As a Hoover Institution media scholar wrote in
the
New York Post (normally no bastion
of deep investigative inquiry):
The Saudis deny any role in 9/11, but the CIA in
one memo reportedly found "incontrovertible evidence" that Saudi government
officials - not just wealthy Saudi hardliners, but high-level diplomats and
intelligence officers employed by the kingdom - helped the hijackers both
financially and logistically.
The intelligence files cited in the report
directly implicate the Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los
Angeles in the attacks, making 9/11 not just an act of terrorism, but an act
of war.
Congressmen "absolutely
shocked"
The two outspoken Representatives, Walter
Jones (R-NC) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass) would be violating
federal law if they offered any specifics about what they know, or even
named any countries mentioned - but did say they were "absolutely shocked"
by revelations of foreign state involvement in the attacks.
Now, they
want a resolution requesting Obama
declassify the entire document.
If the media were to do its job and create the
kind of wall-to-wall coverage it bestows upon, say, inter-spousal murder
trials, Obama might feel he had to release the full 9/11 report. He'd have
to concede there is a public right to know, or at least explain in detail
why he doesn't think so.
Either way, there would be major fireworks.
But
we're not betting on either the president or the media doing the right
thing.
Mainstream Media - out to
lunch, so far
How much publicity is this enormously
significant story getting?
Very, very little...
A search of the Nexis-Lexis
database turned up just 13 articles or transcripts.
-
One was a very short,
cautious piece from the Boston Globe.
-
One was a transcript of TV
commentator Lou Dobbs on Fox News.
-
All of the others were specialty or
ideological publications or blogs - Investor's Business Daily, the Blaze,
Prairie Pundit, Right Wing News, etc. (CNN's Piers Morgan did interview Rep.
Lynch).
-
Nothing showed up from,
-
the New York Times
-
Washington Post
-
Politico
-
MSNBC,
or the broadcast networks...
That's a remarkable oversight, given that the
media
did cover similar concerns expressed by former senators Bob Kerrey and
Bob Graham almost two years ago.
In an affidavit for a lawsuit by the
families of 9/11 victims, Graham, head of the joint 2002 congressional 9/11
inquiry, said,
"I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least
some of the terrorists who carried out the September 11th attacks and the
government of Saudi
Arabia."
Kerrey, who served on the non-congressional 9/11 Commission,
said in his own affidavit,
"Evidence relating to the plausible involvement
of possible Saudi government agents in the September 11th
attacks has never been fully pursued."
But two House members, one a Democrat, one a
Republican, explicitly calling for the President to make the full report
available?
That's certainly news...
What Will Obama Do?
If President
Obama does declassify the records,
that would be surprising, if not outright shocking.
Although he has belatedly (and under heavy
pressure from his base) begun to shift more toward at least the rhetoric of
openness, Obama
failed to stand up for release of still-classified documents related to
the John F. Kennedy assassination (a half century after that
tragedy), and he has presided over myriad actions that
take
us further than ever from transparency.
Meanwhile,
the media has all but
abdicated its responsibility to hold the administration's feet to the fire
on these and related matters.
At WhoWhatWhy, we understand how hard it
is to get this kind of material into the hands of the American people.
Our
groundbreaking reporting on ties between prominent and powerful Saudis
and the men said to have been on the planes attacking on September 11 (via a
house in Sarasota, Florida) was almost entirely ignored by the establishment
media, including many so-called "alternative" and "progressive" outlets,
though it has nonetheless spread widely thanks to the Internet and social
media.
Even the above-mentioned New York Post only now has
acknowledged our reporting on the Saudi-Sarasota connection, without
mentioning our name or linking to us.
No matter. The significance is that others have
come forward to ask tough questions about the daunting reach and
self-protective reflexes of our government's ever-expanding "secret sector."
With a related meta-issue -
NSA surveillance - odd bedfellows like
"leftie" Glenn Greenwald and "rightie" Larry Klayman (with a Bush appointed judge
ruling in his favor) are going at the surveillance state simultaneously,
mightily aided by former intelligence analyst
Edward Snowden.
Whatever one thinks of
the 9/11 story - and one
needn't buy the more extreme theories to be open to examining new,
documented facts - there's clearly more to that trauma than we have been
allowed to know; and we suspect there are many more establishment figures
with a hunger for the truth.
And once more "respectable" Washington insiders
like House (and Senate) members start saying shocking things - well, that's
a man-bites-dog story few news organizations can turn down.
As for the executive branch, representatives of
the State Department, Department of Justice and FBI have repeatedly denied
knowing anything about the Saudi angle.
If those documents are ever
declassified, the denials themselves - and those issuing those denials -
should also be news.
Inside The Saudi 9/11 Cover-up

After
the 9/11 attacks, the public was told al
Qaeda acted alone, with no state sponsors.
But the White House never let it see an entire section of Congress'
investigative report on 9/11 dealing with "specific sources of foreign
support" for the 19 hijackers, 15 of whom were Saudi nationals.
It was kept secret and remains so today.
President
Bush inexplicably censored 28 full pages of the 800-page
report. Text isn't just blacked-out here and there in this
critical-yet-missing middle section. The pages are completely blank, except
for dotted lines where an estimated 7,200 words once stood (this story by
comparison is about 1,000 words).
A pair of lawmakers who recently read the redacted portion say they are
"absolutely shocked" at the level of foreign state involvement in the
attacks.
Reps. Walter Jones (R-NC) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) can't
reveal the nation identified by it without violating federal law.
So they've proposed Congress pass a resolution
asking President
Obama to declassify the entire
2002 report,
"Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community
Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11,
2001."
Some information already has leaked from the
classified section, which is based on both CIA and FBI documents, and it
points back to Saudi Arabia, a presumed ally.
The Saudis deny any role in 9/11, but the CIA in one memo reportedly found
"incontrovertible evidence" that Saudi government officials - not just
wealthy Saudi hardliners, but high-level diplomats and intelligence officers
employed by the kingdom - helped the hijackers both financially and
logistically.
The intelligence files cited in the report
directly implicate the Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los
Angeles in the attacks, making 9/11 not just an act of terrorism, but an act
of war.
Modal Trigger
The findings, if confirmed, would back up open-source reporting showing the
hijackers had, at a minimum, ties to several Saudi officials and agents
while they were preparing for their attacks inside the United States.
In fact, they got help from Saudi VIPs from
coast to coast:
-
LOS ANGELES:
Saudi consulate official Fahad al-Thumairy allegedly arranged for an advance team to receive
two of the Saudi hijackers - Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi -
as they arrived at LAX in 2000.
One of the advance men, Omar al-Bayoumi,
a suspected Saudi intelligence agent, left the LA consulate and met
the hijackers at a local restaurant. (Bayoumi left the United States
two months before the attacks, while Thumairy was deported back to
Saudi Arabia after 9/11.)
-
SAN DIEGO:
Bayoumi and another suspected
Saudi agent, Osama Bassnan, set up essentially a forward operating
base in San Diego for the hijackers after leaving LA.
They were provided rooms, rent and
phones, as well as private meetings with an American al Qaeda cleric
who would later become notorious, Anwar al-Awlaki, at a Saudi-funded
mosque he ran in a nearby suburb. They were also feted at a
welcoming party. (Bassnan also fled the United States just before
the attacks.)
-
WASHINGTON:
Then-Saudi Ambassador Prince
Bandar and his wife sent checks totaling some $130,000 to Bassnan
while he was handling the hijackers.
Though the Bandars claim the checks were
"welfare" for Bassnan's supposedly ill wife, the money nonetheless
made its way into the hijackers' hands.
Other al Qaeda funding was traced back to Bandar and his embassy -
so much so that by 2004 Riggs Bank of Washington had dropped the
Saudis as a client.
The next year, as a number of embassy employees popped up in terror
probes, Riyadh recalled Bandar.
"Our investigations contributed to
the ambassador's departure," an investigator who worked with the
Joint Terrorism Task Force in Washington told me, though Bandar
says he left for "personal reasons."
-
FALLS CHURCH, VA.:
In 2001, Awlaki and
the San Diego hijackers turned up together again - this time at the
Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center, a Pentagon-area mosque built with
funds from the Saudi Embassy.
Awlaki was recruited 3,000 miles away to
head the mosque. As its imam, Awlaki helped the hijackers, who
showed up at his doorstep as if on cue. He tasked a handler to help
them acquire apartments and IDs before they attacked the Pentagon.
Awlaki worked closely with the Saudi Embassy. He lectured at a Saudi
Islamic think tank in Merrifield, Va., chaired by Bandar. Saudi
travel itinerary documents I've obtained show he also served as the
official imam on Saudi Embassy-sponsored trips to Mecca and tours
of Saudi holy sites.
Most suspiciously, though, Awlaki fled the United States on a Saudi
jet about a year after 9/11.
As I first reported in my book, "Infiltration," quoting from
classified US documents, the Saudi-sponsored cleric was briefly
detained at JFK before being released into the custody of a "Saudi
representative."
A federal warrant for Awlaki's arrest
had mysteriously been withdrawn the previous day. A US drone killed
Awlaki in Yemen in 2011.
-
HERNDON, VA.:
On the eve of the attacks,
top Saudi government official Saleh Hussayen checked into the same
Marriott Residence Inn near Dulles Airport as three of the Saudi
hijackers who targeted the Pentagon.
Hussayen had left a nearby hotel to move
into the hijackers' hotel. Did he meet with them? The FBI never
found out. They let him go after he "feigned a seizure," one agent
recalled. (Hussayen's name doesn't appear in the separate 9/11
Commission Report, which clears the Saudis.)
-
SARASOTA, FLA.:
9/11 ringleader Mohamed
Atta and other hijackers visited a home owned by Esam Ghazzawi, a
Saudi adviser to the nephew of King Fahd.
FBI agents investigating the connection
in 2002 found that visitor logs for the gated community and photos
of license tags matched vehicles driven by the hijackers. Just two
weeks before the 9/11 attacks, the Saudi luxury home was abandoned.
Three cars, including a new Chrysler PT
Cruiser, were left in the driveway. Inside, opulent furniture was
untouched.
Democrat Bob Graham, the former Florida
senator who chaired the Joint Inquiry, has asked the FBI for the Sarasota
case files, but can't get a single, even heavily redacted, page released.
He says it's a "cover-up."
Is the federal government protecting the Saudis? Case agents tell me they
were repeatedly called off pursuing 9/11 leads back to the Saudi Embassy,
which had curious sway over White House and FBI responses to the attacks.
Just days after Bush met with the Saudi ambassador in the White House, the
FBI evacuated from the United States dozens of Saudi officials, as well as
Osama bin Laden family members. Bandar made the request for escorts directly
to FBI headquarters on Sept. 13, 2001 - just hours after he met with the
president.
The two old family friends shared cigars on the Truman Balcony
while discussing the attacks.
Bill Doyle, who lost his son in the World Trade Center attacks and heads the
Coalition of 9/11 Families, calls the suppression of Saudi evidence a
"coverup beyond belief."
Last week, he sent out an e-mail to relatives
urging them to phone their representatives in Congress to support the
resolution and read for themselves the censored 28 pages.
Astonishing as that sounds, few lawmakers in fact have bothered to read the
classified section of arguably the most important investigation in US
history.
Granted, it's not easy to do. It took a month-long letter-writing campaign
by Jones and Lynch to convince the House intelligence panel to give them
access to the material.
But it's critical they take the time to read it and pressure the White House
to let all Americans read it. This isn't water under the bridge. The
information is still relevant... today.
Pursuing leads further, getting to the
bottom of the foreign support, could help head off another 9/11.
As the frustrated Joint Inquiry authors warned, in an overlooked addendum to
their heavily redacted 2002 report,
"State-sponsored terrorism substantially
increases the likelihood of successful and more lethal attacks within
the United States."
Their findings must be released, even if they
forever change US-Saudi relations.
If an oil-rich foreign power was capable of
orchestrating simultaneous bulls-eye hits on our centers of commerce and
defense a dozen years ago, it may be able to pull off similarly devastating
attacks today.
Members of Congress reluctant to read the full report ought to remember that
the 9/11 assault missed its fourth target: them.
