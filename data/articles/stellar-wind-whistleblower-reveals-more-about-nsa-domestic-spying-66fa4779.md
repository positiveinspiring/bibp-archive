Former top NSA mathematician and code breaker,
William Binney, has gone on record to publicly reveal the scope of a
top-secret surveillance program called Stellar
Wind which led to his resignation in 2001.
It is a program that has directly targeted
everyday Americans following 9/11.
Binney has endured harassment by his own
government, as many
other whistleblowers have when trying to reveal illegal activities
and corruption.
Binney has stated that the scope of the data collection
conducted by the NSA forms a map that can "show your entire life over
time."
In a new video interview with
Russia Today posted below, Binney goes on to provide more details in
light of the Petraeus/Allen scandal, and discusses Narus devices which
can be accessed by agencies like the FBI that can in Binney's words,
"collect on the order over one hundred
billion one thousand character e-mails a day. One device."
The problem, to this point, has been how to
centralize and sift through the massive amount of information collected.
The U.S. government, however, has already
stated its desire to seek new ways to manage this "big data", ensuring
that widespread data collection can continue.
The NSA is set to complete
its $2 billion
fortress of domestic surveillance by September 2013 that indicates
one step toward big data management. It can store 100 years worth of
electronic information.
But this data collection initiative is not
only within the walls of the NSA; it is taking place across the board in
our largest federal agencies and departments such as,
-
the National
Institutes of Health
-
Department of Defense
-
National Science
Foundation
-
the Department of Energy
-
the U.S. Geological survey
-
DARPA
The Obama administration
through the Office
of Science and Technology Policy has announced a $200 million investment
in taking this information "from data to decisions."
This scientific and national defense
endeavor is all-encompassing, as it seeks data input and sharing between
government and private companies, such as Amazon, as well as public
universities.
When Binney spoke to Wired in an article by James Bamford, he explained that
the NSA could have focused only on international communications:
Instead it chose to put the wiretapping
rooms at key junction points throughout the country - large, windowless
buildings known as switches - thus gaining access to not just
international communications but also to most of the domestic traffic
flowing through the US.
The network of intercept stations goes far
beyond the single room in an AT&T building in San Francisco exposed by a
whistle-blower in 2006.
'I think theres 10 to 20 of them,'
Binney says. 'Thats not just San Francisco; they have them in the
middle of the country and also on the East Coast.'

The new NSA facility at Bluffdale, Utah, will
have the capability to spy,
"on every single form of communication,
ranging from the entirety of private emails, cell phone calls, Google
searches and other Internet activity, to data on travel, parking
receipts, purchases at bookstores, and anything and everything they can
get their hands on."

However, rather than feel paranoid or try to
hide from the runaway train of surveillance and the increasing number of
lists we're all on, Binney offers a piece of sage advice that we all would
do well to adopt:
RT: Were
you on the target list?
WB: Oh,
sure! I believe Ive been on it for quite a few years. So I keep telling
them everything I think of them in my e-mail. So that when they want to
read it theyll understand what I think of them.
