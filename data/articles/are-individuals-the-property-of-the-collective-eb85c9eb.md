Mankind has faced a bewildering multitude of self-made catastrophes and
self-made terrors over the past few millennium, most of which stem from a
single solitary conflict between two opposing social qualities:
individualism vs. collectivism.
These two forces of organizational mechanics
have gone through evolution after evolution over the years, and I believe
the long battle is nearing an apex moment; a moment in which one ideology or
the other will become dominant around the world for well beyond the
foreseeable future.
The assumption often made amongst academia is that the philosophy that
appeals most to our natural survival imperative and caters to our desire
for innovation will eventually win the day. That there is no right or
wrong side; only the effective, and the less effective. The advanced and
the outmoded. The transcendent, and the archaic.
It should come as no surprise then that most academics and prominent
mainstream talking heads often sing the praises of collectivism as the
inevitable champion in the war between cultural engines.
Collectivism always presents itself with
the flair and sexiness of the new, or the progressive, while individualism
tends to wear the unpleasant battle scars of hard earned principles and
heritage.
Collectivism is the hot looking but mentally
unstable bombshell blonde making promises of excitement and long term
comfort she has no intention of keeping. She is so seductive not because she
has any profound inner qualities, but because she has a knack for letting
you believe she is exactly what you fantasize her to be.
Only when its too late do you realize shes a
psychopathic pill popping man-eater
Collectivism is, in fact, a bastardization of a more useful human condition;
namely community. Inherent in all people is the need for meaningful
connection with others, and thus, the world around them, without being
forced to sacrifice their own identities and their own souls in the process.
The best representation of this model is the
idea of voluntary community, where individuals seek out each other and
facilitate their own connections. However, if they cant find meaningful
connection, many people will settle for whatever they can get.
Collectivist structures thrive by shutting down free cultural avenues,
manipulating public media, encouraging fear, repression, and bias, and
destroying our ability to relate to others in a natural and voluntary way.
Collectivisms first goal is to distract and
ISOLATE individuals from one another, so that honest community is difficult
to build. Its second goal is to then offer a false community; a cardboard
cutout or proxy that entices the public with fabricated and superficial
connections that barely satiate our inner hunger for relationship with our
fellow man (Facebook,
anyone?).
It uses our thirst for understanding against us,
and lures us into a system of psychological enslavement where no
understanding will ever be found.
Karl Marx is famous for stating that religion
is the opium of the people, a belief that communists like Mao
Zedong adopted. But, Mao was not opposed to opiates for the masses per
se, only citizen organizations that could not be control. Mao simply
replaced the various deities of the Chinese people with the religion of the
collectivist state.
Like any opiate, collectivism instills addiction.
The feeling of belonging to something bigger
than oneself (even if it ends up being false) creates ecstatic euphoria, a
euphoria that weakens as time passes unless the addict commits himself even
deeper into the hive mind. Soon, every original aspect of the persons
character is forgotten and replaced entirely by his hyper-obsession with the
collective.
The whole of his identity becomes a shallow
product of the state and he may even defend that state, no matter how
corrupt, to the death. He now treats any criticism of the system as a
personal attack on himself, because everything he is has been given to him
by the collective.
If the collective is a sham, then so is he.
Collectivism as a philosophy is a perfect tool for oligarchy. The men who
dominate such systems rarely if ever actually believe in the tenets they
espouse. They sell the idea of single-minded society as a nurturing light
that will create group supremacy, prosperity, and perfect safety.
But the truth is, they couldnt care less about
accomplishing any of these things for the masses. They are only interested
in exploiting the promise to galvanize the population into a fraudulent
community, a dystopia in which the citizens police each other in the name of
the state, giving the elites total dominance.
The most vital aspect of the collectivist process is convincing the public
that the individual citizen is not sovereign, but is actually the property
of the group.
Many readers have already witnessed this argument first hand
in the statements of MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry, who believes
your children are not yours to raise, but products of the collective to be
molded:
But this is only a taste of collectivist zealotry at work.
Here are just a few of the most prominent
disinformation tactics and methodologies used by centralization cultists to
twist the fabric of nations and enslave individuals
1) The Blank Slate
Blank slate theory stems from the Freudian model of psychology and has
been adopted and refined by modern mainstream clinical psychiatry.
The theory contends that all psychological
processes and character traits of an individual are merely products of
repetition and memory derived through environmental experience.
Psychiatry extends the theory into biology in the belief that all human
behavior is nothing more than a series of reactionary chemical processes
in the brain that determine pre-coded genetic responses built up from
the conditioning of ones environment.
The foundational assertion of blank slate
theory is that human beings are born empty. That we are bio-computers;
soft machinery, just waiting to be programmed.
The blank slate argument is essential to the philosophy of collectivism.
If every person is born without inherent characteristics or spirit, and
all people are manufactured by environmental conditions alone, then,
collectivists contend, there is no such thing as true individualism.
Programmed people cannot act, they can only
react according to their conditioning. Therefore, they have no inherent
ability to choose, or to determine their own destinies.
If a society can be convinced that this theory is fact, then the inner
self (the source of individualism), no longer bears any meaning. The
environment is then seen as the only determinant that people should care
about. Environment becomes the sole master of their lives, and whoever
controls the environment, controls them.
The problem is, blank slate theory has been proven time and time again
to be absolutely false.
From the work of MIT professor Steven
Pinker, to the psychological studies of Carl Jung, to the
linguistic studies of Noam Chomsky, as well as numerous studies
in mathematics, quantum physics, and anthropology; every field of
science has produced more than ample evidence that human beings are
not born as blank slates.
Rather, they are born with the very building
blocks of thought, language, mathematics, and even predispositions
towards certain personality traits.
The most important of all of these discoveries though is attributed to
Carl Jung, who found that moral conceptions are in fact inborn. The
existence of psychological dualities at birth (including an
unconscious sense of good and evil) means that all people come into the
world with the ability to CHOOSE.
Environment only determines our lives if we
allow it to.
This is why the worst of men sometimes come
from the most sheltered and safe environments, while the best of men
often come from broken and terrible homes.
Collectivists have struggled desperately for ages to deny or destroy the
concept of inherent individualism. They want us to believe that
everything that we have was given to us by them.
As long as we know they have given us
nothing, they can never truly win
2) Individualism Is The Same As Selfishness
Collectivists repeat this lie Ad nauseam.
The suggestion is simple - even the smallest
individual actions affect everyone, thus, everyone is culpable for the
problems of the whole. And, if everyone is responsible for the problems
of the whole, then everyone must take responsibility for everyone else.
The job of society then, at least in the
opinion of collectivists, is to keep every individual member of that
society in line. One unruly cog could bring the entire machine to a
halt. Anyone who refuses to submit to the directives of the group is
bound to hurt the group, and is, therefore, selfish, or even criminal.
The insanity of this way of thinking should be obvious.
First of all, it assumes that the directives
of the group are always logically and morally sound. It assumes that
because the majority of people have come to a particular conclusion,
that conclusion must, by default, be correct. The fact is, history has
shown that at any given moment the majority is wrong about something, if
not most things, and these mass trespasses against reason and conscience
always end up being stopped by a minority of individualists.
The greatest social achievements of mankind
are the result of the ingenuity and courage of individuals
who in turn inspired others.
Perhaps the best possible thing is for the machine to be sabotaged at
times by selfish individuals. Perhaps individuals are actually more
necessary to the survival of the group than the group is to the survival
of individuals
3) The Family Unit Cannot Be Trusted To
Raise The Next Generation
In the quest for a collectivist system, all competing interests must be
debased.
The individual must have nowhere to turn for
guidance or comfort but the system itself. Children become a highly
sought after target, because their inborn personalities are easier to
oppress, and because they are always dependent on someone for their
survival already.
The collective (usually in the form of
government) desires to be that someone the child depends on, and so,
the role of the parents has to be diminished.
Collectivists in the U.S. use the It Takes A Village approach in order
to marginalize the family unit and paint parents as secondary figures in
the development of their own offspring.
Under this philosophy, each subsequent
generation is seen as a kind of commodity, a resource that belongs to
the group and that must be protected from the damaging ideologies of
the parents.
One has only to examine the extreme
politicization of American public schools today to see this process in
action.
The goal is to push the idea of family into
obscurity, while forcing children into indoctrination factories that
instill specific behaviors through fear, shame, and propaganda.
No one, and no entity, however, has the capacity to care for any child
more than that childs own parents. Some parents do fail in their
responsibilities, but what kind of role model does government really
make in their place? Governments lie, cheat, steal, rape, murder, and
mass murder in order to get what they want.
Government has nothing worthwhile to teach
anyone, including our children.
4) Global Problems Will Be Solved By
Collectivism
I find in my examinations that the opposite is true.
Most global problems are CAUSED by
collectivism, not solved by it. The greater good is always subjective.
The group will always be an abstract illusion held together by nothing
more than the whims of the individual. And, in the grand scheme of
things, only individuals make any difference in the course of human
cultural development.
The collectivist strategy requires the
suppression of individualism, otherwise, they cannot obtain power. That
means, the very bedrock of their philosophy is a threat to the security
of the future.
In their obscene quest to control tomorrow,
they ensure that tomorrow dies.
-
They promise community, and they
give you isolation.
-
They promise prosperity, and they
give you servitude.
-
They promise safety, and they give
you a land of perpetual terror.
-
They promise purpose, and give you
insignificance.
-
They promise peace, and they foment
war after war after war, reaping turmoil all around us, as well
as within us.
Our only hope is to maintain the integrity of
our heart, and our will.
The proclamation that the individual is subject
to the necessities of the collective is a con. There is no such prerogative.
In the end, there is no power over us but that which we give away.
The state doesnt matter. The group doesnt
matter. The greater good doesnt matter. All that matters is the life of
the individual. Each individual.
For when all men rediscover their individualism,
only then will we be able to move forward as a whole.
