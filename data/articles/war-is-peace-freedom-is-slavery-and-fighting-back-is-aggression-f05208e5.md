The US Department of Defense recently
promulgated a new defense guidance document: Sustaining
U.S. Global Leadership - Priorities for 21st Century Defense.
I use scare quotes because it just doesnt seem
quite right to use defense to describe a document that - like its
predecessors - envisions something like an American Thousand-Year Reich.
The greatest shift in emphasis is in the section Project power despite
Anti-Access/Area Denial Challenges:
The threat to be countered is that China and
Iran,
will continue to pursue asymmetric means to
counter our power projection capabilities.
That refers to a long-standing phenomenon:
What Pentagon analysts call Assassins
Mace weapons - cheap, agile weapons that render expensive, high-tech,
weapons systems ineffective at a cost several orders of magnitude
cheaper than the Pentagons gold-plated turds.
In the context of area denial, they
include cheap anti-ship mines, surface-to-air missiles, and anti-ship
missiles like the Sunburn (which some believe could destroy or severely
damage aircraft carriers).
Thus the Pentagon defines as a threat a
countrys ability to defend itself effectively against attack or
to prevent an enemy from putting offensive forces into place to attack it.
Yes, you read that right:
To the American national security
establishment, its considered threatening when you prepare to defend
yourself against attack by the United States.
Its the perspective of a Family Circus
character:
Mommy, he hit me back!
That kind of double standard is pretty common in
the National Security States assessment of the world.
What can one say of a situation in which America runs a military budget
equal to the rest of the industrialized world put together, maintains
military bases in half the countries around the globe, routinely intervenes
to overthrow governments, rings China with military bases - then solemnly
announces that Chinas military establishment is,
far larger than called for by its
legitimate defensive needs?
Considering that the U.S. considers its
legitimate defensive needs to encompass outspending the other top ten
military powers in the world combined and maintaining the ability to
preemptively attack any other country in the world, its hard to guess what
the Pentagons criterion is for determining Chinas legitimate defensive
needs.
But its safe to say legitimate defensive
forces dont extend to the ability for China to defend its territory against
attack from the main actual threat facing it: A global superpower trying to
turn Chinas neighborhood into a battlefield.
And how about attacking Saddam for making war on his own neighbors - when
the U.S. actively supported his invasion of Iran in the 1980s?
Not to mention the U.S. Marines waltzing in and
out of most of Americas Caribbean neighbors throughout the middle of the
20th century. Did they have incubator babies in Nicaragua and
Costa Rica back in the 1930s?
To Washington, any country capable of resisting American attack, or of
defying American commands (whether under a UN Security Council fig-leaf or
not) is by definition a threat.
And any country inflicting significant losses on
U.S. military forces, in the process of defending itself against American
military attack, is guilty of aggression (against U.S. attempts to defend
our freedom, one presumes).
American perceptions of self-defense and aggression are as distorted
as those of Nazi Germany.
When the only way you can defend yourself
against another countrys threat is to go to the other side of the world
to fight it, because it lacks the logistical capability to project military
force more than a few hundred miles outside its own borders - and the main
threat is its ability to fight back when you attack it - you know
somethings pretty messed up.
