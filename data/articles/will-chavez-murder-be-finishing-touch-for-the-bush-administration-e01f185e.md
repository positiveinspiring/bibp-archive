President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez has
repeatedly told that during the last weeks of George W. Bush's
presidency in the United States the Bolivarian republic and he, Chavez,
personally would be in danger.
The way he called on his allies to be on
alert was described in the pro-American mass media and by the opposition
members as persecution mania and paranoid fear of death.
They said nobody had ever made an assassination
attempt on him and would hardly do it in future.
Washington's high-ranking officials have
long decided on how to get rid of me - Hugo Chavez said citing reliable
source in the ally countries in Western hemisphere, in Europe and in the
US. He even hinted that he had the sources of information even in the
U.S. Embassy in Caracas.
There are enough stories how the United States
eliminated the unwanted Latin American politicians.
Remember,
-
a Colombian 'populist' Jorge Eliecer
Gaitan (killed in April of 1948)
-
an Ecuador President Jaime Roldos (died
in air crash in May, 1981)
-
the leader of Panama Omar Torrijos (also
died in a strange air crash in August, 1981)
As a rule, Chavez mentions Salvador
Allende, who was President of Chile until his death during the coup
d'etat in 1973. Then the CIA and the U.S. military intelligence
organized the coup to let Augusto Pinochet succeed Allende.
All those politicians did not find support in
the U.S. and thus were doomed.
If we trace the chain of accusations Mr. Chavez has been facing over the
past few years from members of the Bush administration, we'll see that there
is only one more political leader who arises such hatred among the U.S.
establishment - Fidel Castro.
However, after Fidel officially stepped down,
they view Chavez as their major rival in Latin America.
He is opposed to the U.S. in all spheres:
-
he carries out independent oil policy
-
tries to diversify energy supplies
(treating China as the most preferable partner)
-
takes steps to modernize the army of
Venezuela with the help of Russia and China
-
welcomes a multipolar world model
-
supports populist regimes in Latin
America
Hugo Chavez initiated the creation of the
South American military block to promote integration processes on the
continent - a move which Washington could have hardly been happy about. All
American military chiefs, who headed the U.S. Southern Commandment, warned
Chavez against such steps.
The situation resulted in U.S. preventive
measures aimed at establishment of additional bases in the region, the
'revival' of the Fourth Fleet in the South Atlantic, a boost to the space
surveillance system in Venezuela and all its allies, especially Brazil.
The strategic flights of the Russian Tu-160 bombers over the Caribbean and
the Atlantic waters, their stay at the Libertador base in Maracay and the
forthcoming visit of the squadron of the Russian North Fleet led by the
Piotr the Great nuclear-powered cruiser provoke even greater annoyance of
the White House hawks.
The conspirators failed to kill Chavez during the coup in early April of
2002.
He was detained, but while he was transported
from one place to another, there were always some loyal officers behind him
to prevent the tragedy. They told the guards they would provide an adequate
response if Chavez is assassinated.
After the coup failed, the U.S. special services intensified the work aimed
against the Venezuelan President.
The journalistic dossier I compiled during the
years in Venezuela consists of a few heavy volumes. If we add some video
reports from the ultra-conservative Venezuelan and North American TV
channels, containing straightforward statements against Hugo Chavez, and
hundreds volumes of the so-called anti-Chavez literature, which is traded
freely in Venezuela, - we'll be able to imagine how intense are the impulses
coming from numerous fanatic terrorists and the opposition members.
The CIA knows it perfectly well that sustainable work in the right
direction will give necessary results- someone who is ready to sacrifice his
life for the sake of democratic ideals.
Sooner or later he will blow himself up near the
presidential car. One does not have to be an expert to name the mass media
in Venezuela which deal with this brainwashing:
Their major everyday task is to stir up
hatred to the president. Hugo Chavez calls them means of information
terrorism.
Another large-scale campaign against Chavez was implemented in May of 2004.
It was prepared in Columbia, where apart from U.S. military bases, there is
located a CIA regional residence.
With the help of its agents in the Colombian
police (Departamento administrativo de seguridad), they formed a
100-member expedition group and sent it to Venezuela. The group comprised
the paramilitares, rebels from the so-called department of self-defense,
used in Colombia to fight the Marxist guerrilla groups.
Pretending to be season workers, the rebels arrived in the Caracas suburbs
to settle at Roberto Alonso's house. Alonso was one of the organizers
of the 2002 conspiracy, a reliable CIA agent. The task was to seize
the presidential palace Miraflores, to kill the president and, if the
circumstances are favorable enough, to stage a coup against Chavez
dictatorship. The organizers gave the rebels the uniform of the Venezuelan
armed forces and were about to supply the weapons, when the country's
counterintelligence interfered and arrested the rebels, who later face
trial.
In late September of 2008 Venezuela's special services uncovered the
conspiracy of the acting and retired officers and the opposition extremist
groups. During many hours of telephone eavesdropping, the special services
managed to learn that following the CIA instructions, those engaged in
conspiracy kept watching Chavez and tried to get information on his working
plans.
The final aim was to kill the Venezuelan
President in September-early November, ahead of the national election of
governors and alcaldes. According to recent opinion polls, the
opposition has very few chances to win in all 22 states of Latin America.
The scenario of Chavez's assassination and the dissolution of the
National Election Council was suggested as a means to undermine
stability in the region and cause chaos and bloodshed.
As the conspirators believed, such circumstances
would have helped them to seize power, confuse Hugo Chavez supporters and
ask the US help in restoring "true democracy".
Military pilots on F-16 jets were also involved in the conspiracy- their
mission was to attack the Miraflores palace from air.
For the same purposes, the conspirators received
AT4 grenade guns and Carl Gustav rifles with muzzle velocity of 150 to 700
meters per second. The country was rummaged for any kind of weapons,
including M16 rifles and hand bombs. Some of the conspirators managed to
escape to the Caribbean islands of Bonaire and Curacao, where CIA
network used to be especially active. Others fled to Colombia...
It would be naive to think that ahead of the presidential elections in the
United States, the CIA agents will stop their hunt for Hugo Chavez.
The task has no deadlines, it must be fulfilled despite all scandals, huge
expenditures and combat losses. The CIA always has alternative ways to
follow.
The problem is how to choose the right one to be
able to say later,
We have nothing to do with it...
