Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Group of 77
For a New World Order for Living Well Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Plurinational State of Bolivia
14 and 15 June 2014
Declaration
Part I Overall context 1. We, the Heads of State and Government of the member States of the Group of 77 and China, have gathered in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Plurinational State of Bolivia, for the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the Group. 2. We commemorate the formation of the Group of 77 on 15 June 1964 and recall the ideals and principles contained in the historic Joint Declaration of the Seventy-Seven Developing Countries, signed at the end of the first session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), held in Geneva. 3. We recall that the first ever statement of the Group of 77 pledged to promote equality in the international economic and social order and promote the interests of the developing world, declared their unity under a common interest and defined the Group as "an instrument for enlarging the area of cooperative endeavor in the international field and for securing mutually beneficent relationships with the rest of the world". 4. We also recall the first Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77, held in Algiers from 10 to 25 October 1964, at which the Group adopted the Charter of Algiers, which established the principles of unity, complementarity, cooperation and solidarity of the developing countries and their determination to strive for economic and social development, individually or collectively. 5. We highlight that the Group of 77 has provided the means for the countries of the South to articulate and promote their collective social and economic interests and enhanced their joint negotiating capacity within the United Nations system, and note with satisfaction that the Group has established a permanent secretariat at United Nations Headquarters in New York and chapters in Geneva, Nairobi, Paris, Rome, Vienna and the Group of 24 in Washington, D.C., and that its membership now stands at 133 member States. 6. We also recall the successful holding of the first South Summit of the Group of 77 and China in Havana in April 2000 and the second South Summit in Doha in June 2005, at which the status of the Group of 77 and China was elevated to the level of Heads of State and Government and at which important declarations and plans of action were adopted that have guided our Group and constitute the fundamental basis for the construction of a new world order and an agenda owned by the countries of the South for the establishment of a more just, democratic and equal system that benefits our peoples. 7. We pledge to continue the tradition of our countries on building national development and uniting at the international level, towards the establishment of a just international order in the world economy that supports developing countries achieve our objectives of sustained economic growth, full employment, social equity, provision of basic goods and services to our people, protection of the environment and living in harmony with nature. 8. We are proud of the legacy and great achievements of the Group of 77 and China in defending and promoting the interest of the developing countries over the past 50 years, which have contributed gradually to greater strength and influence on economic, social and environmental issues. We pledge to build on this foundation and continue making progress towards a world order that is just, equitable, stable and peaceful. Major landmarks in this regard have been the adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order in 1974, the Declaration on the Right to Development in 1986 and several other historic declarations that recognize and address the needs and interests of developing countries and constitute an utmost priority. 9. We believe in the peaceful settlement of conflicts through dialogue. 10. We also note that, despite five decades of achievements, there are still serious shortfalls in fulfilling our Group's objectives, and that our countries individually and collectively now face ongoing and emerging challenges, including the slowdown of the global economy and its effects on our countries and the lack of adequate systemic action and accountability to address the causes and effects of the global financial and economic crises, thus creating the risk of continuing with the pattern of crisis cycles. 11. We also note the gaps in many of our countries in meeting the needs of employment, food, water, health care, education, housing, physical infrastructure and energy of our people, as well as the looming environmental crisis, including the negative impacts of climate change in developing countries, the increasing shortage of drinking water and the loss of biodiversity. 12. We stress that imbalances in the global economy and the inequitable structures and outcomes in the trading, financial, monetary and technological systems led to the establishment of our Group. Nevertheless, these imbalances still prevail today in some ways with even more adverse effects on developing countries. Therefore, we pledge to continue and intensify our efforts to strive for a fair, just and equitable international order oriented towards the fulfillment of the development needs of developing countries. 13. We emphasize that the rationale for the establishment of our Group 50 years ago remains actual and valid, and indeed more valid, than at that time. We therefore rededicate ourselves and our countries to strengthening and expanding the unwavering efforts of the Group of 77 and China in all fields towards greater achievement and for the betterment of the lives of our people. 14. We affirm that the twenty-first century is the time for the countries and the peoples from the South to develop their economies and societies in order to fulfill human needs sustainably, in harmony with nature and respect for Mother Earth and its ecosystems. We agree to build on our traditional values and practices of solidarity and collaboration for mutual benefit and on the strength of our people, to achieve progress in our countries and in South-South cooperation. 15. We emphasize that our major priorities are promoting sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, and promoting the integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems that supports, inter alia, economic, social and human development while facilitating ecosystem conservation, regeneration and restoration and resilience in the face of new and emerging challenges. 16. We reaffirm that the main strength of the Group of 77 has been and will be its unity and solidarity, its vision of fair, just and equitable multilateral relations, the commitment of its member States to the well-being and prosperity of the peoples of the South as well as our commitment to mutually beneficial cooperation. 17. We emphasize that each country has the sovereign right to decide its own development priorities and strategies and consider that there is no "one size fits all" approach. We stress the need for international rules to allow policy space and policy flexibility for developing countries, as they are directly related to the development strategies of national Governments. We further emphasize the need for policy space to enable our countries to formulate development strategies expressing national interests and differing needs which are not always taken into account by international economic policymaking in the process of integration with the global economy. 18. We are concerned about the current state of the global economy and the state of global economic governance and the need for strong recovery. We believe that the world is confronted with the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression, and we are alarmed by the adverse effects this crisis is having especially on developing countries. We believe the crisis has highlighted long-standing systemic fragilities and imbalances in the global economy, and further exposed the inadequacy and undemocratic nature of global economic governance. New attempts must now be made to establish proper global economic governance, with the full voice, representation and participation of developing countries in discussions and decision-making. 19. We recognize the high importance of sustaining social protection and fostering job creation even in times of economic crisis, and take note with satisfaction of the encouraging examples of policies that allow countries to reduce poverty, increase social inclusion and create new and better jobs in recent years. 20. We view with concern the increased concentration and the asymmetric distribution of wealth and income in the world, which have created wide inequality between developed and developing countries. This level of inequality is unjustifiable and cannot be tolerated in a world where poverty is still prevalent, resources are being depleted and environmental degradation is increasing. We call for global actions to reduce inequalities at all levels. We also pledge to address inequality in our own countries. 21. We note with concern the influence of large corporations, mainly from developed countries, on the global economy, and its negative effects on the social, economic and environmental development of some developing countries, particularly regarding the barriers this may pose for the entry of new enterprises in the global market. In this regard, we call for concrete measures from the international community to address these negative effects and to promote international competition and increased market access for developing countries, including policies that foster the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, the removal of trade barriers that inhibit value addition in origin countries, such as tariff peaks and tariff escalation, as well as capacity-building on competition law, tax policy regulations and social corporate responsibility. 22. We emphasize that transnational corporations have a responsibility to respect all human rights and should refrain from causing environmental disasters and affecting the well-being of peoples. 23. We recognize the progress achieved in sustainable development at the regional, national, subnational and local levels and we reaffirm the importance of supporting developing countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty by empowering the poor and people in vulnerable situations, promoting developing sustainable agriculture as well as full and productive employment and decent work for all, complemented by effective social policies, including social protection floors. 24. We fully respect the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, particularly as they relate to equality among States, respect for the independence of States, national sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of States, and stress that those principles and purposes inspire our full commitment to multilateralism and the search for a more just and equitable international economic system that offers opportunities to raise the standard of living of our peoples. 25. We are deeply aware that decades after political independence, some developing countries are still in the grip of economic dependence on the structures and vagaries of the global economy and on the developed countries and their economic entities. Such dependence, especially by poor and vulnerable countries, limits the extent of our real political independence as well. Therefore, we pledge to unite our efforts to continue striving for economic independence and to gather under the umbrella of the Group of 77 and China as well as other organizations of the South to make progress on this. 26. We recall the decisions taken at the second South Summit in Doha (2005) to work to ensure that programs and policies designed in the context of globalization fully respect the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, particularly as they relate to equality among States, respect for the independence of States, national sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of States, and to stress that those principles and purposes inspire our full commitment to multilateralism and the search for a more just and equitable international economic system that offers opportunities to raise the standard of living of our peoples. 27. We also recall the decision taken at the Group of 77 and China Summit in Doha (2005) to work towards the realization of the right to self-determination of peoples living under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation, which adversely affects their social and economic development, and to call on the international community to take all necessary measures to bring an end to the continuation of foreign occupation, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. 28. We reaffirm that indigenous peoples have the right to maintain and strengthen their distinct political, legal, economic, social and cultural institutions, while retaining their right to participate fully, if they so choose, in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the State. In this regard, we emphasize the need to respect and safeguard indigenous cultural identities, knowledge and traditions in our countries. Part II Development in the national context Approaches for sustainable development 29. We stress the need to further mainstream sustainable development at all levels, integrating economic, social and environmental aspects and recognizing their interlinkages, so as to achieve sustainable development in all its dimensions. 30. We reaffirm that there are different approaches, visions, models and tools available to each country, in accordance with its national circumstances and priorities to achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions, which is our overarching goal (United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development). In some countries there is an approach of "living well" as holistic development aimed at achieving the material, cultural and spiritual needs of societies in a context of harmony with nature. 31. We acknowledge that the Earth and its ecosystems are our home and we are convinced that, in order to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environmental needs of present and future generations, it is necessary to promote harmony with nature and the Earth. We also recognize that "Mother Earth" is a common expression for planet Earth in a number of countries and regions, which reflects the interdependence that exists among human beings, other living species and the planet we all inhabit. 32. We welcome the celebration held in 2011 of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development, which is a major landmark document that establishes the right of developing countries to act to achieve development and the right of people to participate in and benefit from development. 33. In this context, we reaffirm that development is a comprehensive economic, social, cultural and political process that aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom as recognized in the Declaration on the Right to Development. 34. We further reaffirm the proclamation in the Declaration on the Right to Development that the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized as recognized in the Declaration. Improving the practice of democracy 35. We consider that democracy is a universal value based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives. We reaffirm that while all democracies share common features, there is no single model of democracy and that democracy does not belong to any country or region, and further reaffirm the necessity of due respect for sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity and the right to self-determination, and the rejection of any attempt to break down constitutional and democratic order legitimately established by the peoples. 36. We call for an end to the use of media in any way that might disseminate distorted information against States members of the Group of 77 in complete disregard of the principle of international law. 37. We express our deep indignation and rejection with regard to the facts related to the surprise withdrawal of overflight and landing permits for the presidential aircraft on which President Evo Morales Ayma of the Plurinational State of Bolivia and his party were travelling on 2 July 2013. These facts constitute unfriendly and unjustifiable acts that have also put at serious risk the safety of President Morales. We make public our greater solidarity and demand clarification of facts. National sovereignty and benefits over natural resources 38. We affirm that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. 39. We also reaffirm that the right of peoples and nations to permanent sovereignty over the natural wealth and resources must be exercised in the interest of their national development and of the well-being of the people of the State concerned. 40. While emphasizing the sovereignty of our countries and peoples over their natural wealth, we are also aware of our duty to conserve and sustainably manage and use these resources and ensure the conditions for nature and ecosystems to have the capacity to regenerate, for the benefit of present and future generations. We also recognize that the sustainable use of natural resources is an effective way to achieve economic growth while reducing poverty and environmental degradation. 41. We take note of and respect the decisions of some countries that decided to nationalize or to reclaim control of their natural resources in order to obtain greater benefits for their people, especially the poor, and to invest in the economic diversification, industrialization and social programs. 42. We urge that technical and capacity-building assistance be provided to developing countries at the international, regional and national levels to support them in obtaining the maximum benefits from the extraction and use of those resources in line with sustainable development, taking into account the full exercise of the sovereign right of our countries over their natural resources. Eradication of poverty 43. We recognize that poverty is an affront to human dignity and stress that poverty eradication is the greatest global challenge facing the world today, and we attach the highest priority to poverty eradication in the United Nations post-2015 development agenda to be supported by effective and adequate means of implementation and strengthened global partnership for development, and which entails, among other objectives, the promotion of employment and decent work for all, the improvement of access to social services, the eradication of illiteracy and diseases as well as integrated, coordinated and coherent national and regional strategies. 44. We express our deep concern for the constraints on the fight against poverty arising from the crises, in particular the world financial and economic crisis, the continuing food insecurity, the volatility of capital flows and the extreme volatility of commodity prices, energy accessibility and the challenges posed by climate change to developing countries. 45. We further stress that, in order to enable Governments of developing countries to effectively eradicate poverty, developing countries must ensure national ownership of their own development agenda, which entails preserving their own policy space backed by a strong political commitment to reduce poverty in line with their national priorities and circumstances. As such, Governments of developing countries must formulate their own development strategies to assist the poor through policies and actions, including on, but not limited to, strong, sustained and inclusive economic growth, the generation of employment as a priority, in particular for the young population, the improvement of the provision of universal and affordable access to basic services, the provision of a well-designed social protection system, the empowerment of individuals to seize economic opportunities, and measures to ensure the protection of the environment. 46. We recall the United Nations Convention against Corruption, which is the most comprehensive and universal instrument on corruption, and we recognize the need to continue promoting ratification of or accession to the Convention and its full implementation. We also recognize that fighting corruption at all levels is a priority and that corruption is a serious barrier to effective resource mobilization and allocation and diverts resources away from activities that are vital for poverty eradication and sustainable development. 47. We take note with appreciation of the ancestral and traditional values of some of our peoples such as the Andean principles of Ama Suwa ("do not be a thief"), Ama Llulla ("do not be a liar") and Ama Qhilla ("do not be lazy"), which in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms contribute to efforts to prevent and tackle corruption. Reducing inequality 48. We emphasize that the problem of inequality is even more acute today than ever because of the prevalence of extreme wealth while poverty and hunger continue to exist and this is aggravated, inter alia, by unsustainable patterns of consumption and production mainly in developed countries. We affirm that any benefit from economic growth has to be equitably shared and must benefit the people in vulnerable situations in our communities, and we therefore call once again for concerted actions to reduce inequalities at all levels. 49. We are gravely concerned at the inadequacy of measures to narrow the widening gap between the developed and the developing countries, and within countries, which has contributed to, inter alia, deepening poverty and has adversely affected the full enjoyment of all human rights, in particular in developing countries. 50. We also note with concern that high levels of inequality within and among countries continue to have a negative impact on all aspects of human development and are especially harmful to people in vulnerable situations who are affected by intersecting inequalities. We therefore urge countries, including through the support of international cooperation, to scale up efforts to provide equal access to opportunities and outcomes to all levels of society in accordance with national policies. 51. We understand that sustainable development involves a change in the order of priorities from the generation of material wealth to the satisfaction of human needs in harmony with nature. The excessive orientation towards profit neither respects Mother Earth nor takes into account human needs. The continuation of this unequal system will lead to further inequality. Sustained and inclusive economic growth 52. We affirm that sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth is necessary to eradicate poverty, provide jobs and raise the living standards of our people and generate public revenues to finance social policies. We note that historical evidence has shown that no country has ever achieved constant improvements in living standards and human development without sustaining a steady pace of economic growth. We therefore urge the international community and the United Nations to assist developing countries in attaining high and adequate economic growth over a sustained period. 53. We also realize that high economic growth, although necessary, is not sufficient in itself. We realize that economic growth must be sustained and inclusive by generating jobs and lifting the incomes of peoples in vulnerable situations, especially the poor and the most in need. Economic growth should also be environmentally and socially sound and, to achieve this, developing countries require, among other sources, financial and technological support from developed countries according to national plans. Creation of employment 54. We express the view that the capacity to generate full employment and decent work is fundamentally linked to reviving and enhancing productive development strategies, through adequate finance, investment and trade policies. In this regard, we reaffirm the need for significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources and the effective use of financing, in order to give strong support to developing countries in their efforts to promote sustainable development. We also stress the need to maintain coherence between macroeconomic and job creation policies in order to ensure inclusive and resilient global economic growth. 55. We are deeply concerned about the continuing high levels of unemployment and underemployment, particularly among young people, and affirm our commitment to reducing unemployment through employment-intensive macroeconomic and development policies. We affirm the need to launch an intergovernmental process, within the United Nations, to include the issue of youth employment and youth concerns in the current process of the post-2015 development agenda. We also affirm the importance of ensuring decent livelihoods for farmers in our countries. 56. We affirm the need to launch an intergovernmental process within the United Nations to develop a global strategy on improving employment skills and generating youth employment. Providing basic services for our people 57. We are concerned that there remains a substantial and increasing gap between the world's rich and poor, which is due not only to an unequal distribution of income, but also to unequal access to basic resources and services, which hinders the creation of economic opportunities for all. 58. We recognize that the State has an essential role to play to ensure that basic services are accessible to all and to address the unequal and discriminatory distribution of and access to them. 59. We also reaffirm our resolve to act to implement the right of our people to access basic services. 60. We reaffirm our commitments regarding the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, to be progressively implemented and realized for our populations with full respect for national sovereignty. 61. We call upon donor countries and international organizations to advance in the provision of financial resources, capacity-building and technology transfer, through international assistance to and cooperation with developing countries, in order to scale up efforts to provide safe, clean, accessible and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all. Access to public health and medicines 62. We recognize that universal health coverage means that everyone has access, without discrimination, to a set of basic medical services of promotion, prevention, cure and rehabilitation that meet the needs and are determined nationally, as well as to essential quality, safe, affordable and effective medicines while ensuring that the use of these services does not entail serious economic difficulties for users, especially people in vulnerable situations. 63. We also recognize that many developing countries do not have the financial or human resources or the infrastructure to implement the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Therefore, we call upon developed countries and relevant international organizations to provide the adequate financial resources and technology to developing countries that will complement their efforts to have policies and measures that provide universal health coverage and basic health services for all. 64. We note with great concern that non-communicable diseases have become an epidemic of significant proportions, undermining the sustainable development of member States. In that sense, we acknowledge the effectiveness of tobacco control measures for the improvement of health. We reaffirm the right of member States to protect public health and, in particular, to ensure universal access to medicines and medical diagnostic technologies, if necessary, including through the full use of the flexibilities in the Doha Declaration on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) and Public Health. 65. We recall paragraph 142 of the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, in which Heads of State and Government reaffirmed the right to use, to the fullest extent, the provisions contained in the TRIPS Agreement, the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, the decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization (WTO) of 30 August 2003 on the implementation of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration and, when formal acceptance procedures are completed, the amendment to article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement, which provide flexibilities for the protection of public health, and in particular to promote access to medicines for all and encourage the provision of assistance to developing countries in this regard. We affirm the importance of taking advantage of the use of TRIPS flexibilities in order to promote the people's health and access to medicines. We call upon developed countries to fully respect the right of developing countries to make full use of TRIPS flexibilities and to refrain from taking actions, including trade measures, to prevent or dissuade developing countries from exercising this right. 66. We are concerned about the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance to existing drugs, including those against tuberculosis and malaria. As a result, increasing numbers of patients, especially in developing countries, face the prospect of dying from preventable and/or treatable diseases. We urge the international health authorities and organizations, especially the World Health Organization (WHO), to take urgent action and to work together upon request with developing countries that do not have adequate resources to address this problem. Agricultural development and food security 67. We recall that food security and nutrition are essential elements for achieving sustainable development and express concern that developing countries are vulnerable to, among others, the adverse impacts of climate change, further threatening food security. 68. We reaffirm that hunger is a violation of human dignity and call for urgent measures to be taken at the national, regional and international levels to eliminate it. We also reaffirm the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food in accordance with their right to adequate food and the fundamental right to be free from hunger, in order to develop and maintain their full physical and mental capacities. We also acknowledge that food security and nutrition are essential to sustainable development and have become a pressing global challenge and, in this regard, we further reaffirm our commitment to enhancing food security and access to adequate, safe and nutritious food for present and future generations in line with the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, including for children under the age of 2, and through, as appropriate, national, regional and global food security and nutrition strategies. 69. We denounce that subsidies and other market distortions driven by developed countries have seriously affected the agricultural sector of developing countries, limiting the ability of this key sector to significantly contribute to the eradication of poverty and to sustained, inclusive economic growth and equitable, sustainable development, food security and rural development. We call for the immediate elimination of all forms of agricultural subsidies and other market-distorting measures taken by developed countries that are not in compliance with WTO rules. We urge developed countries to show flexibility and political will to adequately address these fundamental concerns of developing countries in the Doha Round of trade negotiations. 70. We reiterate our commitment to conclude multilateral disciplines on fisheries subsidies which give effect to the WTO Doha Development Agenda and the Hong Kong ministerial mandates to strengthen disciplines on subsidies in the fisheries sector, including through the prohibition of certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the WTO fisheries subsidies negotiation, taking into account the importance of the sector to development priorities, poverty reduction, and livelihood and food security concerns. 71. We emphasize the need to strengthen the capacity of our countries, especially through international cooperation, to safeguard and enhance our people's nutrition through the promotion of their productive cultural and environmental practices. 72. We also emphasize the urgent need to increase efforts at the national, regional and international levels to address food security and agriculture development as an integral part of the international development agenda. We demand sustained funding and increased targeted investment to enhance world food production and call for new and additional financial resources from all sources to achieve sustainable agriculture development and food security. 73. We further emphasize the need to strengthen the agricultural sector as part of the post-2015 agenda with its means of implementation, to achieve food security, stressing the importance of including the knowledge, practices and technologies of indigenous peoples, rural communities and small- and medium-scale farmers in national, regional and international strategies aimed at achieving food security. 74. We welcome the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 68/177 on the right to food and resolution 68/233 on agricultural development, food security and nutrition. We also welcome the Second International Conference on Nutrition, organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WHO, to be held at FAO headquarters in Rome from 19 to 21 November 2014, which aims to approve the nutrition policy framework for the coming decades and to determine priorities for international cooperation in the field of nutrition in the short and medium term. 75. We welcome the decision of the Director General of FAO to appoint for the second year Evo Morales Ayma, President of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and Nadine Heredia Alarcón, First Lady of Peru, as Special Ambassadors of Quinoa, recognizing their leadership and commitment in the fight against hunger and malnutrition and that the Bolivian and Peruvian Governments showed the world the benefits and quality of that Andean food source. 76. We reaffirm that quinoa's biodiversity and nutritional value make it central to providing food security and nutrition and to eradicating poverty, as well as to promoting the traditional knowledge of the Andean indigenous peoples, contributing to the achievement of food security, nutrition and poverty eradication and raising awareness of their contribution to social, economic and environmental development, and sharing good practices on implementation. 77. We call for the creation of conditions for the development of economic opportunities for the benefit of small-scale and family farmers, peasant and indigenous peoples and communities, and the creation of options for connecting them with consumers, as part of the national strategies for the realization of the right to food. 78. We recognize the positive role of small-scale and family farmers, including women, cooperatives, indigenous peoples and local communities in developing countries, and their knowledge and practices, in the conservation and sustainable use of seeds, agrobiodiversity and biodiversity associated with food production of present and future generations. 79. We stress the need to address the root causes of excessive food price volatility, including its structural causes, at all levels, and the need to manage the risks linked to excessively volatile prices in agricultural commodities and their consequences for global food security and nutrition, as well as for small-scale farmers and poor urban dwellers. 80. We call for the prioritization of development in the WTO Doha Round of negotiations in accordance with the Doha Development Agenda, including food security. We call for the promotion of the livelihoods of small-scale farmers and rural development in developing countries. In this context, we urge WTO members to adopt a permanent solution to the issue of public stock holding and food security for developing countries, as agreed by the WTO Ministerial Decision adopted in Bali, Indonesia, in 2013, as soon as possible. Sustainable family farming 81. We declare that family farms and small farms are an important basis for sustainable food production aimed at achieving food security (General Assembly resolution 66/222). In this framework, support should be given to the economic activities of sustainable family farming, taking into account the traditional knowledge of such farmers, in order to improve their situation and development, in particular promoting their access to financial services, productive resources and agricultural inputs such as land, seeds, appropriate technology, transport and information. 82. We will promote comprehensive and complementary national and regional actions for production, access and consumption based on integral, multisectoral and participatory planning, reassessing and strengthening sustainable family farming, small-scale farmers, indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants. Industrialization and infrastructure 83. We affirm that industrial development and value addition, together with science, technology and innovation, are, among others, essential elements for developing countries to attain higher development levels in a sustained way, as the industrialization process can generate higher productivity, more jobs and skills and positive spillover effects on the economy. Therefore, we urge developed countries to assist developing countries in boosting industrialization in their development strategies and policies and in promoting inclusive sustainable industrial development, in accordance with their national interests. 84. We note that many developing countries are still overly dependent on commodities and that they should explore industrial diversification strategies by, inter alia, enhancing value-adding productive capacities. 85. We call on relevant international organizations and request international cooperation mechanisms to provide adequate assistance to developing countries, including through technology transfer, to develop their capacities to design and implement industrialization strategies and policies, in accordance with their national priorities. 86. We call for the international trading system to respect and reinforce the policy space of developing countries for the promotion and growth of our industrial development and for the design and implementation of our industrial strategies. In this regard, we call for the revision of all rules within the world trading system that affect the policy space of developing countries. 87. We affirm that the development of reliable and affordable infrastructure, regional connectivity, and its appropriate interlinkage through science, technology and innovation, including transport, roads, energy and telecommunications, as well as the promotion of market access for exports coming from developing countries, are essential elements in improving the quality of life of our people and in the sustainable development of our countries. 88. In this regard, we urge developed countries and international organizations, in accordance with internationally agreed commitments, to provide adequate financial assistance to support the transfer of reliable and affordable technologies and to promote capacity-building, taking into account national priorities. 89. We urge developed countries to provide technical assistance, technology transfer and financial resources to enable our countries to industrialize and develop our infrastructure in ways that are environmentally sustainable. 90. We emphasize in this regard the importance of technical assistance for industrial development in member States with the aim of adopting cleaner, resource-based and energy-efficient sustainable consumption and production patterns, including cleaner fossil fuel technologies. 91. We welcome the initiative of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, as Chair of the Group of 77 and China, to organize the Meeting of Ministers of Industrialization and counterparts on the issue of governance of natural resources and industrialization, in coordination with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Economic Commission for Africa, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, to take place in Tarija in August 2014. 92. We welcome the Lima Declaration: Towards Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development, which was adopted at the fifteenth session of the General Conference of UNIDO, held in Lima in December 2013, as an important step in our common endeavours to achieve sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. Inclusion of women in development 93. We recall the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, reaffirm the vital role of women and the need for full and equal opportunities for their participation and leadership in all areas of sustainable development, and decide to accelerate the implementation of our respective commitments in this regard as contained in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, as well as in Agenda 21, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the Program of Action of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development. 94. We also recognize that the potential of women to engage in, contribute to and benefit from sustainable development as leaders, participants and agents of change has not been fully realized. We support prioritizing measures to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in all spheres of our societies. We resolve to unlock the potential of women as drivers of sustainable development through many measures and commit to creating an enabling environment for improving the situation of women and girls everywhere, particularly in rural areas and local communities and among indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities. 95. We are committed to ensure equal rights and opportunities for women in political and economic decision-making and resource allocation, to give women equal rights with men to economic resources, and to ensure access to education, finance, information and communications technologies, markets, legal assistance and other basic services, including health-care services, including safe, effective, affordable and acceptable modern methods of family planning. 96. We recall our respective commitments under General Assembly resolution 61/143 and other relevant resolutions on this matter, recognize that violence against women seriously violates all human rights of women, and therefore agree to take action to eliminate all forms of violence, including feminicide and discrimination against women and girls, by means of a more systematic, comprehensive, multisectoral and sustained approach, adequately supported and facilitated by strong institutional mechanisms and financing, through national action plans, including those supported by international cooperation and, where appropriate, national development plans, including poverty eradication strategies and program-based and sector-wide approaches. 97. We reaffirm the commitment to work together towards a post-2015 development agenda with a gender perspective. 98. We urge the need to tackle critical remaining challenges for women and girls through a transformative and comprehensive approach and call for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls to be reflected as a stand-alone sustainable development goal and to be integrated through targets with inclusive policies to overcome poverty and foster social and economic development in our countries. Indigenous peoples 99. We urge efforts towards the implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands, natural resources, identity and culture, in accordance with national legislation. We reaffirm our respective commitments to implement our legal obligations, including, as appropriate, Convention No. 169 of the International Labour Organization, as well as to promote the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 100. We reaffirm the value and the diversity of the cultures and the forms of social organization of indigenous peoples and their holistic traditional scientific knowledge, innovations and practices, which play a significant role in strengthening the livelihoods of the local populations, ensuring food security and addressing climate change. 101. We stress the importance of indigenous peoples in the achievement of sustainable development in developing countries and their critical role in the social, economic and political processes of our countries, while strengthening the local views and values referred to as the holistic views of Mother Earth. 102. We reaffirm the importance of the role of collective action and the efforts of indigenous and local communities in conserving biodiversity, considering their critical role in the stewardship and sustainable management of natural renewable resources. 103. We consider that mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are contingent upon different sociocultural contexts, taking particular account of indigenous peoples and local communities and their traditional knowledge systems and practices, including their holistic view of community and environment, as a major means of adapting to climate change. 104. We call for strengthening the interscientific dialogue between traditional and indigenous knowledge systems with modern sciences in the context of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and of the conceptual framework of "Living well in balance and harmony with Mother Earth", approved by the Platform. 105. We welcome the convening of the high-level plenary meeting of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, to be known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, to be held in New York on 22 and 23 September 2014, with the purpose of sharing insights and best practices on the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The action-oriented outcome document of this Conference should contribute to the realization of the rights of indigenous peoples and the pursuit of the objectives of the Declaration, and promote the achievement of all internationally agreed development goals. 106. We take note of the Special Declaration on the Coca Leaf of the Heads of State and Government of the Latin American and Caribbean States within the framework of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, held in Havana on 29 January 2014, which acknowledges the importance of preserving the cultural and traditional practices of indigenous peoples in the context of respecting all their human and fundamental rights, in conformity with the relevant international instruments. In this context, the Heads of State and Government recognize coca leaf chewing (akuliku, or chacchado) as an ancestral cultural manifestation of the people of the Andean region that must be respected by the international community and express interest in knowing the results of scientific research conducted by renowned institutes and universities of the international community on the properties of the coca leaf. Part III South-South cooperation 107. We reaffirm the Nairobi outcome document of the High-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation, therefore recognize the importance and different history and particularities of South-South cooperation, and reaffirm our view of South-South cooperation as a manifestation of solidarity among peoples and countries of the South that contributes to their national well-being, their national and collective self-reliance and the attainment of internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. South-South cooperation and its agenda have to be set by countries of the South and should continue to be guided by the principles of respect for national sovereignty, national ownership and independence, equality, non-conditionality, non-interference in domestic affairs and mutual benefit. 108. We reaffirm the importance of strengthening South-South cooperation, especially in the current international economic environment, and reiterate our support for South-South cooperation as a strategy to sustain the development efforts of developing countries and as a means of enhancing their participation in the global economy. We reiterate the position of the Group that South-South cooperation is a complement to, rather than a substitute for, North-South cooperation and reaffirm that South-South cooperation is a collective endeavor of developing countries based on the principle of solidarity and premises, conditions and objectives that are specific to the historic and political context of developing countries and to their needs and expectations, and that as such, South-South cooperation deserves its own separate and independent promotion, as reaffirmed in the Nairobi outcome document. In this context, we stress that South-South cooperation and its agenda must be driven by the countries of the South. As such, South-South cooperation, which is critical for developing countries, requires long-term vision and a global institutional arrangement, as envisioned by the Second South Summit. 109. We welcome the convening of the High-level Panel of Eminent Personalities of the South in Natadola, Fiji, from 7 to 9 May 2013, in accordance with the relevant mandate of the second South Summit. We also welcome the Panel's conclusions and recommendations on the future landscape of South-South cooperation as an important contribution to the further development of the Development Platform for the South. We reiterate the framework and principles of South-South cooperation first endorsed by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 at their 32nd annual meeting, held in New York on 26 September 2008, which the Panel also used as a basis for their discussions. 110. We welcome the conclusion of the third round of the Global System of Trade Preferences, which is a tool to promote and strengthen South-South trade integration, and call upon more developing countries to participate in the Global System. 111. We also note and welcome the increase in regional cooperation initiatives that concretely manifest South-South cooperation and integration in various areas, such as finance, banking, trade, health care and food production. We hope that these initiatives will benefit not only the participants of the regional programs but also other developing countries. We call for further initiatives in the future, as well as concrete ways in which developing countries can share experiences and good practices so as to spread these South-South initiatives. 112. We encourage our countries to exchange experiences and best practices with regard to the equal access by all to basic services. 113. We stress that the High-level Committee on South-South Cooperation of the General Assembly is the central multilateral policymaking body in the United Nations system to review and assess global and system-wide progress and support for South-South development cooperation, including triangular cooperation, and to provide overall guidance on future directions. 114. We also stress that South-South cooperation, as an important element of international cooperation for development, is not a substitute for, but is rather a complement to, North-South cooperation and its agenda has to be set by countries of the South. We support the integration of South-South and triangular cooperation in the policies and strategic framework of funds and programs of the United Nations system, as well as its strengthening through the system-wide provision of additional resources, including through financial and human resources to the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, and recognize that the Office, currently hosted by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), constitutes a separate entity with a distinct legal nature, entrusted with the coordination on a global and United Nations system-wide basis for promoting and facilitating initiatives related to South-South cooperation for development. 115. In this regard, we request the establishment of a more formalized and strengthened inter-agency mechanism for the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, with a view to encouraging joint support for South-South and triangular initiatives, as well as sharing information on development activities and results achieved by various funds, agencies and organizations in support ofSouth-South and triangular cooperation. 116. We also call upon the United Nations development system to promote transfer of technologies from developed countries for the benefit of developing countries to address issues of poverty eradication and sustainable development, and in this context encourage, when possible, technology cooperation among the countries of the South. 117. We acknowledge the role played by the South Centre in supporting the Group of 77. We call upon the members of the Group to further support the Centre and call upon the Centre to expand its activities for the benefit of developing countries. We encourage organizations of developing countries, including the South Centre, to come up with ideas and suggest action plans to further operationalize South-South cooperation. Part IV Global challenges Global partnership for development 118. We stress the need for a new and stronger commitment by developed countries to international cooperation aimed at supporting the fulfillment of the development aspirations of developing countries. As part of the Millennium Development Goals, a commitment was made to a global partnership for development, which was the international cooperation dimension of the Millennium Development Goals framework. However, we note with concern the significant shortfall in the partnership under the Goals, which contributed to the lack of achievement of many goals and targets. We therefore call for the urgent implementation of all commitments under the global partnership for development so as to overcome the gaps identified in the reports of the Millennium Development Goals Gap Task Force. 119. We also call upon leaders of the developed countries to agree and commit to a new phase of international cooperation through a strengthened and scaled-up global partnership for development, which should be the centerpiece and anchor for both the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda. Such an enhanced global partnership should include the issues of providing financial resources to developing countries, official development assistance, debt relief and debt restructuring, trade, technology transfer and greater participation of developing countries in global economic governance. Official development assistance 120. We reaffirm that official development assistance remains the main source of international financing for many developing countries and that it is essential as a catalyst for development, facilitating the achievement of national development objectives, including the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals, the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda, in accordance with paragraph 246 of the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development ("The future we want"). 121. We stress that developed countries must meet and scale up their existing official development assistance commitments and targets made, inter alia, in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus, the 2005 World Summit outcome, the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development and in relevant forums. An enhanced predictable and sustainable flow of official development assistance is essential to meet the regular development challenges as well as the new and emerging challenges in developing countries, in particular in least developed countries. We recall the unfulfilled commitment made by developed countries at the meeting held in Gleneagles, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 122. We urge the developed countries to fulfill their commitment to provide 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance for developing countries as well as to achieve the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance to the least developed countries and to increase the target to 1 per cent of gross national income by 2030. We express our deep concern that official development assistance commitments remain unfulfilled. 123. The global financial and economic crisis cannot be an excuse to avoid fulfilling existing aid commitments by developed countries and to make further commitments. An effective response to the economic crisis requires timely implementation of existing aid commitments and an urgent and unavoidable need for donors to fulfill them. We therefore call upon developed countries collectively to fulfill their official development assistance commitments and to raise overall levels further, keeping in mind that the developing countries will require new, additional and sustainable financial resources to a significant extent and amount in order to implement a wide range of development activities. 124. We stress the need for ensuring new and additional financial support to developing countries as a key means of implementation for achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the forthcoming sustainable development goals. Financial assistance should be made available without conditionalities, since development strategies should be country-led and take into account the specific conditions, needs and priorities of developing countries. It should be based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, with North-South cooperation at its core and South-South and triangular cooperation as a useful complement. 125. We stress that official development assistance is a key source for financing the development of developing countries that should be used in accordance with their national developmental priorities without conditionalities, and express our deep concern about the attempt made by donor countries, outside United Nations forums, to redefine official development assistance by including other sources of financing that are not linked or related to the development of developing countries, with the objective of disguising the drop in official development assistance flows not based on their agreed commitments, which are still pending fulfillment. External debt 126. We are concerned that, with the global economic crisis, the economies of increasing numbers of developing countries are being affected and that some countries are becoming more vulnerable to new external debt problems or even crises. Addressing the external debt problems of developing countries is thus an important part of international cooperation and the enhanced global partnership for development. 127. We are of the view that debt crises tend to be costly and disruptive and are usually followed by large cuts in public spending and a decline in economic growth and employment. These crises affect developing countries more deeply and those that are heavily indebted are unable to return to the path of growth without international assistance. We recognize the importance of debt relief, including debt cancellation, debt restructuring, debt moratorium and debt audit procedures. Debt restructuring processes should have as their core element a determination of real payment capacity so that they may not adversely affect economic growth and the fulfillment of the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals, the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda. In this regard, we reiterate the urgent need for the international community to examine options for an effective, equitable, durable, independent and development-oriented international debt resolution mechanism, and call upon all countries to promote and contribute to the discussions within the United Nations and other appropriate forums with that objective. 128. We also recall that sovereign debt management has been a crucial issue for developing countries in past decades and recent years. Recently, a new concern has emerged relating to the activities of vulture funds. Recent examples of the actions of vulture funds in international courts have revealed their highly speculative nature. Such funds pose a risk to all future debt-restructuring processes, both for developing and developed countries. We therefore stress the importance of not allowing vulture funds to paralyze the debt-restructuring efforts of developing countries, and that these funds should not supersede a State's right to protect its people under international law. 129. We express serious concern about the substantial increase in the financial stability risks of many developed economies and, in particular, their high structural fragilities in financing sovereign debt created as a result of transferring private risk to the public sector. In this regard, we call for urgent and coherent solutions to reduce sovereign risk in developed economies in order to prevent contagion and to mitigate its impact on the international financial system and on developing countries. 130. We stress the need to ensure that the economic and monetary policies implemented by developed countries do not affect global aggregate demand and liquidity, owing to the objective of finding surplus in their balance of payments, with negative results in the reduction of global revenues in developing countries. Reforming the global financial architecture 131. We affirm the need for reform of the international financial architecture so that we have a financial and monetary system that reflects the realities of the twenty-first century, including a properly regulated international financial sector that reduces and discourages speculative investment, in order for capital markets to be mobilized to achieve sustainable development and play a constructive role in the global development agenda. 132. We also note the continuation of fundamental problems in the global financial and monetary system, including lack of regulation to ensure financial stability, the problems of the reserve currencies, the volatility in currency exchange rates, the speculative and large cross-border flows of capital and the insufficiency or unavailability of liquidity for developing countries in need of financial resources that face foreign exchange shortfalls or require resources to generate sustainable growth and development. We call for a program of reforms, with full voice, representation and participation of developing countries, to address these problems. 133. We note with concern that financial deregulation and financial liberalization have given rise to the massive expansion of speculative financial flows and derivatives trading. The financial and economic crisis of 2008 has illustrated that international finance has created an economy of its own, which has become increasingly disconnected from the real economy of production, direct investment, job creation and wage growth. The adverse effects of financialization include volatile capital flows, excessive commodity and food price fluctuations, rapid shifts in exchange rates and boom-bust cycles of financial crisis and economic recession. 134. We urge that the reform process of the governance structure of the Bretton Woods institutions be finalized as soon as possible and be much more ambitious, and that an accelerated plan be established for further reforms in representation, participation and parity of voting power for developing countries in the decision-making process within the Bretton Woods institutions and in all discussions on international monetary reform and in the operation of the new arrangements for special drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on the basis of criteria that truly reflect its mandate in the field of development and with the participation of all stakeholders in an equitable, transparent, consultative and inclusive process. In this regard, we call on the General Assembly to launch a process to reform the international financial and monetary system. 135. We support exploration of the establishment of a United Nations intergovernmental mechanism under the General Assembly, as an entity responsible for monitoring the performance of the global economic and financial system in a comprehensive and sustainable manner. It is important that this mechanism monitor the impact of certain international financial flows and policies that are systemically important to prevent the spread of economic and financial crisis among countries. Reforming the credit rating system 136. We stress that international efforts to reregulate the financial sector should include the credit rating agencies. Governments should limit their regulatory reliance on credit rating agencies and reform legal regimes to hold them liable for negligent behavior in order to suppress conflicts of interest and ensure integrity, accountability and transparency. 137. We also stress the need for a more transparent international credit rating system that takes fully into account the needs, concerns and peculiarities of developing countries, especially heavily indebted developing countries. In this regard, we express concern about the extent of soundness of the methodology used by the major credit rating agencies. We emphasize that greater transparency and competition among rating agencies is necessary to avoid oligopolistic tendencies and their negative effects. We reiterate that an inadequate assessment of the solvency of debtors has the potential to cause or exacerbate crises, rendering the financial system more vulnerable. It is necessary to continue the discussions at the United Nations and other venues on the role of credit rating agencies, with a view to proposing concrete policies aimed at reducing dependency on them by enhancing their supervision and increasing transparency and competition through the establishment of independent assessment mechanisms. Global economic governance 138. We affirm that the current world financial and economic crisis and its consequences for development have exposed the gaps and failures in global economic governance, including within the international financial institutions, and the urgent need for a global, universal and integrated response by the international community. We note with deep concern that seven years after the outbreak of the global crisis, there has been little progress made to strengthen the systemic, regulatory and structural aspects of the global financial system. Moreover, the lack of participation by developing countries in general in global economic issues and governance persists; this is a matter of grave concern because the workings of the global system affect all countries, and this democratic deficit has even more serious consequences for developing countries when the global economy is slowing down or in recession. 139. We strongly call on the international community to redress the democratic deficit in global economic governance and provide developing countries their rightful place and participation in the governance and decision-making of all the institutions and forums where discussions and decisions are taken on global economic and financial issues. 140. We affirm that efforts to reform the international financial architecture should therefore be seriously strengthened, should be internationally coordinated and should lead to the full participation of developing countries in international financial and economic decision-making and norm-setting. We call for comprehensive reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, including enhancement of the voting powers of developing countries in a time-bound manner, in order to enable greater equity between developed and developing countries and to eliminate all types of conditionalities tied to aid. 141. We call for the urgent completion of the 2010 IMF quota formula reform in order to ensure that the quotas and governance of IMF better reflect the relative weight of emerging and developing countries in the global economy. However, the redistribution of voting rights to reflect reality alone will not resolve the structural problems of financial instability and the lack of liquidity for developing countries in need to generate the necessary sustainable growth and development. Also the reform should encompass liquidity creation, including improvement in the special drawing rights for developing countries. IMF must provide more comprehensive and flexible financial responses to the needs of developing countries, without imposing procyclical conditionalities and respecting their need for adequate policy space. Furthermore, leading personnel of the Bretton Woods institutions must be designated on the basis of their individual merits, through an open and fair process of selection. As long as IMF does not reflect the new realities in the global economy and its Director General keeps being designated through a process that lacks any transparency, its legitimacy will remain questionable. 142. We stress the need to hold a follow-up international conference on financing for development in 2015 to review the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration with a view to contributing to the post-2015 development agenda process. 143. While respecting the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the intergovernmental nature of the Organization, we recognize the important role of the United Nations in providing an intergovernmental forum, including through international conferences and summits for universal dialogue and consensus on global challenges with the due participation of relevant stakeholders. 144. We reaffirm the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations, as well as the role of the Assembly in global matters of concern to the international community, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations. Strengthening and reorienting the United Nations 145. We reaffirm our commitment to increase the participation of developing countries in the decision-making bodies of multilateral institutions in order to render them more consistent with the current geopolitical reality. 146. We stress the importance of the central role of the United Nations in global economic governance, which aims at enhancing the global partnership for development with a view to creating a supportive and enabling global environment for the attainment of sustainable development and to ensuring financial and economic stability. In this context, the General Assembly and a strengthened Economic and Social Council could both act to mitigate the impact of the international financial and economic crisis and to ensure the right of developing countries to policy space for sustainable development. 147. We stress that strengthening of the United Nations and its role in international cooperation for development is essential to respond to current and future challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization. We recognize that the United Nations needs to improve its capabilities and capacities to fully implement its mandates and to ensure the effective delivery of its programs in the social and economic development fields. In this regard, we urge the Secretary-General to further strengthen the development pillar of the whole Organization, including its Development Account. 148. We urge developed countries to show real political will, so that in the process of reform of the United Nations, including the strengthening and revitalization of the General Assembly as an emblem of global sovereignty, it can improve its capabilities and capacities to fully implement its mandates and ensure the effective delivery of its program in the social, environmental and economic development fields. 149. We stress that strengthening of the United Nations and its role in international cooperation for development is essential to respond to current and future challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization. Within this context, we express our concern over the growing imbalance between assessed and voluntary contributions in the proposed program budgets of the Organization. We also stress that the level of resources to be approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations must be commensurate with all mandated programs and activities in order to ensure their full and effective implementation. 150. We reaffirm that any United Nations Secretariat and management reform efforts, including on the budget process, must not seek to change the intergovernmental, multilateral and international nature of the Organization, but must strengthen the ability of Member States to perform their oversight and monitoring role, and that prior consideration and approval by Member States is essential in all cases where the measures to be implemented fall under the prerogatives of the General Assembly, and in this regard we recall resolution 66/257. We also reiterate the need to increase the representation of developing countries and the representation of women from developing countries, in particular at the senior levels, and to improve geographic distribution in the Secretariat and transparency in the recruitment process. 151. We call for continued efforts to reform the United Nations, including the revitalization of the General Assembly and a comprehensive reform of the Security Council, which correspond to the collective interests of developing countries. 152. We express concern over budget cuts that have a negative impact on the implementation of mandates approved by the intergovernmental bodies of the United Nations, particularly in the development pillar, and the growing imbalance between assessed and voluntary contributions. 153. We call for greater transparency, accountability and oversight by Member States with respect to voluntary and extrabudgetary resources. It is important that resources from voluntary and extrabudgetary contributions be used to support all priorities agreed to by Member States and that they be used strictly in accordance with the intergovernmentally agreed financial regulations and rules of the Organization. 154. We underscore the central role of the United Nations in global economic governance, as a truly universal and inclusive multilateral forum with unquestioned legitimacy, convening power and normative frameworks. We emphasize the important role that the General Assembly should play in the appointment of the Secretary-General of the United Nations upon the recommendation of the Security Council in accordance with Article 97 of the Charter. In this regard, we stress that the process of selection of the Secretary-General should be inclusive of all Member States, as well as more transparent. Furthermore, we believe that regional rotation, as well as respect for equitable geographical representation, should be taken into account during selection and appointment processes. 155. We also recognize the importance of increasing the number of nationals from developing countries at the senior level in the Secretariat, in particular in the Senior Management Group. Technology transfer, science and innovation for development 156. We believe that science, knowledge and technology integration and innovation should be instruments for promoting peace and people's sustainable development, well-being and happiness and that they should thus be oriented towards the promotion of the empowerment of the poor, the eradication of poverty and hunger, and the promotion of solidarity and complementarity among and within peoples so that they may live well in harmony with Mother Earth. 157. We express our concern that science, technology and innovation can be abused as instruments to limit and undermine countries' sovereignty, sustainable development and poverty eradication. 158. We call for an end to the use of information and communication technologies, including social networks, in contravention of international law and in detriment to any State, in particular members of the Group of 77 or their citizens. 159. We reaffirm that technology plays a key role in addressing development challenges across a wide scope of issues, including in food and agriculture, water and sanitation, climate change, energy, industry, chemicals and waste management. Technology transfer, technology integration and the development and promotion of endogenous technologies are important for developing countries to engender economic growth in an environmentally sustainable manner. We call on developed countries to implement their commitments to transfer technology to developing countries and provide access to technology on favorable terms, including concessional and preferential terms, to enable the developing countries to shift to a more sustainable development path. 160. It is imperative that developed countries recommit themselves to the objective of technology transfer as one of the major components, along with finance, capacity-building and trade, of provision of the means of implementation towards sustainable development for developing countries, and to take actions to bridge the technological gap. We call for the early establishment by the United Nations system of a technology facilitation mechanism that promotes the development, transfer and dissemination of clean and environmentally sound technologies, including cleaner fossil fuel technologies. 161. We call for regulations and policies on intellectual property to be placed within a development framework, whereby intellectual property rights are oriented towards the promotion of balanced social, economic and environmental development. In this regard, we support the measures taken by developing countries to promote the implementation of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Development Agenda recommendations of 2007. We reiterate our call, made in paragraph 8 (vii) of the 2005 Doha Plan of Action adopted at the second South Summit of the Group of 77, for WIPO to continue to include in its future plans and activities, including legal advice, a development dimension that includes promoting development and access to knowledge for all, pro-development norm-setting, harmonization with the Convention on Biological Diversity rules, establishing development-friendly principles, and the transfer and dissemination of technology. 162. We also reiterate that the TRIPS Agreement of WTO contains flexibilities, and that it is the right of developing States members of WTO to make use of such flexibilities, as confirmed in the 2001 Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health of WTO, and we support the use of these flexibilities in our countries, with the aim of promoting health, education and economic and social development. We note with great interest and appreciation that some developing countries have successfully made use of some TRIPS flexibilities to promote the use of generic medicines, which are lower in cost and thus greatly increase access to medicines at affordable prices. We reject attempts by any developed country or business interest to pressure developing countries not to exercise their right to make use of TRIPS Agreement flexibilities for social and development purposes and express our solidarity with those developing countries that have come under such pressure. 163. We stress the need to protect the knowledge of developing countries, indigenous peoples and local communities with regard to genetic resources, biodiversity and traditional knowledge, and especially from continuing attempts by persons or companies to patent such resources and knowledge without the approval of the countries, indigenous peoples and communities concerned. 164. We call for intensified efforts by our negotiators and policymakers to establish legal mechanisms, internationally or nationally, to prevent biopiracy by requiring disclosure of the country of origin and proof of benefit-sharing arrangements by applicants for such patents. We also call for strong provisions and effective mechanisms for technology transfer, including appropriate treatment of intellectual property, in the international climate change regime in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Trade 165. We believe that trade in the context of appropriate policies and rules can be an important tool for economic development. Because of the continuing global financial and economic crisis, there has been a decline in trade growth, which has had a severe impact on many developing countries as the result of the fall in export revenues, trade barriers and trade-distorting subsidies in developed countries, and restricted access to trade finance and reduced investment in production diversification and in the promotion of exports and remains a matter of concern. It is essential to establish and uphold a universal, fair, rules-based, open, pro-development, non‑discriminatory, inclusive and equitable multilateral trading system that contributes to growth, sustainable development and employment, particularly for developing countries. 166. We call for a timely and successful conclusion to the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which must fully respect its development mandate and place the needs and priorities of developing countries at its centre. Following the WTO Ministerial Conference in Bali in 2013, we call for an inclusive and transparent negotiating process and the prioritizing of the interests and issues of developing countries in the post-Bali program. We view with concern that some developed countries members of WTO are more interested in gaining market access to developing countries, while they are themselves not willing to take adequate measures to eliminate or reduce protectionism in their agriculture sector or to provide more market access to developing countries. 167. We reiterate that developed countries should provide effective, sustainably financed trade-related technical assistance and capacity-building tailored to the specific needs and constraints of developing countries, including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework of WTO, in order to address the supply-side and trade-related infrastructure and productive capacity constraints of least developed countries. Likewise, it is crucial for developing countries to have access to financial and technical assistance for capacity-building in order to implement effectively the new WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. In this context, special focus must be given, among other elements, to those projects and programs oriented towards developing and strengthening corridors for reducing costs in international transit. 168. We emphasize the importance of facilitating accession to WTO. The accession process should be accelerated without political impediment and in an expeditious and transparent manner for developing countries, in full compliance with WTO rules. This would contribute to the rapid and full integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system. 169. We believe that trade rules, in WTO or in bilateral and regional trade agreements, should enable developing countries to have sufficient policy space so that they can make use of policy instruments and measures that are required for their economic and social development. We reiterate our call for the effective strengthening of the special and differential treatment and less than full reciprocity principles and provisions in WTO so as to broaden the policy space of developing countries and enable them to benefit more from the multilateral trading system. We also call for bilateral trade and investment agreements involving developed and developing countries to have sufficient special and differential treatment for developing countries to enable them to retain adequate policy space for social and economic development. Migration 170. We consider that the nexus between migration and development must be addressed comprehensively, mindful of the economic, social and environmental dimensions and include a cultural and human perspective. We recognize the need to address this issue through international, regional or bilateral cooperation and dialogue and through a comprehensive, balanced, coordinated and coherent approach, recognizing the role and responsibilities of countries of origin, transit and destination in promoting and protecting effectively the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants and their families, especially those of women and children, regardless of their migration status. 171. We note that despite progress in discussion and dialogue and cooperation at the international level, migration remains inadequately reflected in development frameworks, development agendas and sectoral policies at both the national and global levels. Therefore, we are exploring the possibility of a legally binding convention on migration and development to improve the governance of international migration and to protect and promote the human rights of migrants and their contribution to development, regardless of their migratory status. 172. We acknowledge the important role that migrants play as partners in the development of origin, transit and destination countries, and the need to enhance the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrant workers and their families. We also stress the need to continue to consider the recognition of the qualifications and competencies of migrants and their access to low-cost financial services for remittances. Climate change 173. We affirm that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change. In this regard, we stress that the international response to climate change must fully respect the principles, provisions and ultimate objective of the Convention, in particular the principles of equity and of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. 174. We reiterate that fulfilling the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will require strengthening the multilateral, rules-based regime under the Convention and therefore further reaffirm the importance of continuing the negotiations on climate change under the Convention in accordance with its principles and provisions and of adopting, in 2015, a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all parties. 175. We recall that climate change is one of the most serious global challenges of our times. We underscore the fact that developing countries continue to suffer the most from the adverse impacts of climate change, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and the impact of response measures, even though they are the least responsible for climate change. Accordingly, we call for developed countries to take the lead in responding to climate change. Climate change threatens not only the development prospects of developing countries and their achievement of sustainable development but also the very existence and survival of countries and societies. 176. We recognize that low-lying and other small island countries, developing countries with low-lying coastal, arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods, drought and desertification, and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. 177. We reaffirm the importance of implementing the Warsaw international mechanism for loss and damage associated with climate change impacts adopted at the nineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Warsaw from 11 to 23 November 2013 (decision 2/CP.19). We also recognize the urgency of taking concrete steps during this year, ahead of the twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties, to be held in Lima, for the immediate operationalization of the mechanism. 178. We stress that the developed countries, given their historical responsibility, need to take the lead in addressing this challenge in accordance with the principles and provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, particularly the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and equity, and provide financial and technological support to developing countries in a transparent, adequate and predictable manner under a modality of monitoring, reporting and verification. 179. We reiterate that the extent to which developing countries will effectively implement their commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will depend on the effective implementation by developed countries of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of developing countries. 180. We stress the need to urgently close the ambition gap, and express concern about the lack of fulfillment of commitments by developed countries. In addressing this gap, the focus must not be limited to mitigation only but also address gaps relating to finance, technology and support for capacity-building, balanced with a focus on adaptation to climate change. We emphasize that developed countries must take robust and ambitious mitigation commitments, with ambitious quantitative targets for limiting and reducing emissions, as required by science and mandated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 181. We reiterate the urgency of expediting the process of operationalizing the Green Climate Fund and for its early capitalization, and call upon developed countries to meet the goal of mobilizing $100 billion each year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. 182. We affirm our support for the success of the meeting to be held in Venezuela ahead of the twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties, to be held in Lima, and reaffirm the need to achieve progress in negotiations towards an ambitious, balanced, fair and effective agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in accordance with its principles and provisions, to be agreed in 2015 and to enter into force in 2020 and that actually contributes to the stabilization of the climate system. Biological diversity 183. We reaffirm the recognition contained in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development about the severity of global biodiversity loss and degradation of ecosystems, and emphasize that these undermine global development, affecting food security and nutrition, the provision of and access to water, and the health of the rural poor and of people worldwide, including present and future generations. This highlights the importance of the conservation of biodiversity, enhancing habitat connectivity and building ecosystem resilience. 184. We recognize the importance of the role of the collective actions of the indigenous people and local communities for the protection, use and conservation of biodiversity. We also reaffirm that the traditional knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous peoples and local communities make an important contribution to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and that their wider application can support social well-being and sustainable livelihoods. We further recognize that indigenous peoples and local communities are often most directly dependent on biodiversity and ecosystems and thus are often most immediately affected by their loss and degradation. 185. We welcome the important outcomes of the eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, held in Hyderabad, India, in October 2012, especially the commitment to doubling biodiversity-related international financial flows to developing countries by 2015 and at least maintaining this level until 2020 to contribute to the achievement of the Convention's three objectives. We also call upon the parties to the Convention to review progress made in this context at the twelfth meeting of the Conference of the Parties towards adopting a final target for resource mobilization. 186. We welcome the realization of the joint briefing held on 30 October 2013 by the United Nations Environment Program, WIPO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNDP, UNCTAD, the secretariat of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and the secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity on the implementation of the objectives of the Convention, including actions taken to promote access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization and associated traditional knowledge. We note that similar interactions should be encouraged, recognizing the respective mandates of the organizations involved, and call upon all Member States, in particular developed countries, to speed up the process for the ratification of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from Their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity. 187. We note with deep concern the unprecedented increase in poaching and illegal trade in wildlife and their products in all regions, in particular of elephant tusks and rhinoceros horns. We stress that this trend is detrimental to ecological balance, promotes crime within and across borders and must be halted with a sense of urgency to avoid reversing decades of conservation gains. We therefore strongly condemn poaching and crimes related to illicit trafficking in wildlife, and agree to enhance international cooperation in accordance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and other relevant agreements to curb such practices, address the demand and supply of wildlife and its products and increase the capacity of communities affected by such trafficking to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities. Forests 188. We highlight the social, economic and environmental benefits of forests to people and the contributions of sustainable forest management to the objective of sustainable development. We support cross-sectoral and cross-institutional policies promoting sustainable forest management (United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development), and recognize the importance of the holistic, integral and alternative approaches for the sustainable management of forests developed under the climate change negotiations. 189. We note the outcome of the tenth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests, held in Istanbul, Turkey, from 8 to 19 April 2013, and underscore the importance of the four global objectives on forests for the international community as a whole and in particular for developing countries. The fourth global objective is especially relevant for developing countries since it identifies the need to reverse the reduction in official development assistance and to mobilize new and additional financial resources for the implementation of sustainable forest management. In fulfilling the fourth global objective, it is essential to respect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities between developed and developing countries. In this regard, we urge developed countries to exercise strong political will and flexibility to contribute to the achievement of sustainable forest management. 190. We call for the establishment of a new global forest fund in line with the principles of sustainable development. We consider that this is necessary in order to channel the funds needed by developing countries to sustainably manage their forests. Desertification, land degradation and drought 191. We reaffirm that desertification, land degradation and drought represent serious concerns for developing countries. International action is, therefore, urgently required to address these challenges. We emphasize the great importance of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, particularly in Africa, stressing that desertification, land degradation and drought undermine the three dimensions of sustainable development. We reiterate that addressing desertification, land degradation and drought enables countries to deal with several global policy challenges, such as food security, adaptation to climate change and forced migration. In this context, we note the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, held from 16 to 27 September 2013 in Windhoek. 192. We reiterate the need for cooperation through the sharing of climate and weather information and forecasting and early warning systems related to desertification, land degradation and drought, as well as to dust storms and sandstorms, at the global, regional and subregional levels. In this regard, we invite States and relevant organizations to cooperate in the sharing of related information and forecasting and early warning systems. Oceans and seas 193. We stress the importance of the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and seas and of their resources for sustainable development, including through their contributions to poverty eradication, sustained economic growth, food security and the creation of sustainable livelihoods and decent work, while at the same time protecting biodiversity and the marine environment and addressing the impacts of climate change. We therefore commit to protect and restore the health, productivity and resilience of oceans and marine ecosystems, to maintain their biodiversity, enabling their conservation and sustainable use for present and future generations, and to deliver on all three dimensions of sustainable development. Internet governance, including the right to privacy 194. We view with dismay that some countries have recently been undertaking extensive, arbitrary and unlawful surveillance and/or interception of communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of communications as well as the collection of personal data, including on a mass scale, on people and institutions in other countries, including on political leaders, senior officials and various government departments and agencies, as well as citizens. We call for the ending of such activities, which violate the human right to privacy of individuals and have a negative impact on the relations between countries. In this regard, we all call for intergovernmental entities to discuss and review the use of information and communications technologies to ensure that they fully comply with international law, including human rights law, in accordance with the purpose and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. 195. We welcome the NETmundial Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance held in São Paulo, Brazil, on 23 and 24 April 2014, and take note of its outcome document. 196. We emphasize the important opportunities provided by information and communications technologies, including social media and related infrastructure, as a vehicle to promote better understanding among nations and the achievement of internationally agreed upon development objectives. 197. We recognize at the same time that the illegal use of information and communications technologies has a negative impact on nations and their citizens. In this regard, we express our strong rejection of the use of information and communications technologies in violation of international law, including the right to privacy, and of any action of this nature directed against any Member State, in particular a State member of the Group of 77. 198. We further underscore the importance of ensuring that the use of such technologies should be fully compatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, in particular the principles of sovereignty, the non-interference in internal matters and the internationally recognized rules of civil coexistence among States. 199. In this regard, we take note with concern of the information published in international media about the objectives of the so-called "ZunZuneo" network, which would constitute an illicit use of new information and communications technologies. 200. We therefore reiterate our commitment to intensifying international efforts directed at safeguarding cyberspace and promoting its exclusive use for the achievement of peaceful purposes and as a vehicle to contribute to both economic and social development, and highlight that international cooperation, in full respect of human rights, is the only viable option for fostering the positive effects of information and communications technologies, preventing their potential negative effects, promoting their peaceful and legitimate use and guaranteeing that both scientific and technological progress is directed at preserving peace and promoting the welfare and development of our societies. Millennium Development Goals 201. We express our commitment to strengthening efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and to taking a leading role in shaping the international development agenda during the post-2015 period. We call upon the international community to redouble all efforts for the accelerated achievement of the Goals by 2015 through concrete measures. 202. We note the progress achieved so far in reaching the Millennium Development Goals but are concerned about the unevenness and gaps in achievement and about the vast socioeconomic and environmental challenges that remain in developing countries. We reiterate that the Goals remain critical for meeting the basic needs of people in developing countries, many of which are not on track to achieving them by 2015. 203. We underscore the central role of the global partnership for development and the importance of Millennium Development Goal No. 8 in achieving all the Goals and that without substantial international support and systemic changes, several of the Goals will not be achieved in many developing countries by 2015. We call upon the international community to intensify its efforts to provide enhanced means of implementation to developing countries through a renewed global partnership based on the collective quest to eradicate poverty and deprivation. Sustainable development and sustainable development goals 204. We recall and reaffirm the statement made by world leaders in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, "The future we want", that poverty eradication is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. 205. We reiterate that eradicating poverty, changing unsustainable patterns of consumption and production, promoting sustainable patterns of consumption and production, and protecting and managing the natural resource base for economic and social development are the overarching objectives of and essential requirements for sustainable development. We also reaffirm the need to achieve sustainable development by promoting sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, and promoting integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems that supports, inter alia, economic, social and human development while facilitating ecosystem conservation, regeneration and restoration and resilience in the face of new and emerging challenges. 206. We stress that sustainable development goals should address and be focused on the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social and environmental) and be guided by the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, respecting all the Rio Principles and taking into account different national circumstances, capacities and priorities. 207. We reaffirm that the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development is the basis for the work of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals. We underscore the importance for the sustainable development goals to build upon and complement the Millennium Development Goals in making progress towards the overarching objective of achieving poverty eradication. 208. We stress that progress in realizing the Millennium Development Goals, the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda will depend on progress in creating a pro-development, international, enabling environment and delivering the relevant means of implementation, particularly in the areas of finance, trade, technology and capacity-building, to developing countries. 209. We reaffirm that the guiding principles of the sustainable development goals must be based on all principles set out at the major United Nations summits and conferences in the social, environmental and economic fields, bearing in mind those set out in, among others, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Agenda 21 and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, and those arising from the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (2012), the International Conference on Financing for Development (2002) and the World Summit for Social Development (1995), and be consistent with international law. The process and outcome of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals should fully respect all the Rio Principles, in particular the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The sustainable development goals should contribute to the full implementation of the outcomes of all the major summits in the economic, social and environmental fields. 210. We reaffirm the recognition that planet Earth and its ecosystems are our home and that "Mother Earth" is a common expression in a number of countries and regions, and note that some countries recognize the rights of nature in the context of the promotion of sustainable development. We are convinced that in order to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environment needs of present and future generations, it is necessary to promote harmony with nature. We call for a holistic, integrated approach to sustainable development, which may include, among others, the recognition by some countries of the principles mentioned above, to guide humanity to live in harmony with nature and lead to efforts to restore the health and integrity of the Earth's ecosystems. 211. We welcome the interactive dialogue of the General Assembly on Harmony with Nature, held on 22 April 2013, to commemorate International Mother Earth Day. At the event, different economic approaches were discussed in the context of sustainable development, to promote a more ethical basis for the relationship between humanity and Earth, as was the need to promote the sustainable use of natural resources, bearing in mind the importance of exploring the adoption and implementation of policies to build national developmental strategies that promote a better distribution of benefits, going beyond the mere production of raw commodities, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 67/214. 212. We stress that the report of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals must be the result of an inclusive intergovernmental process. Thus, we reaffirm our commitment to actively engaging in such negotiations. 213. We underscore the need to define adequate means of implementation for each and every sustainable development goal, as well as the need for a dedicated sustainable development goal on the strengthened global partnership for sustainable development containing broader commitments on the means of implementation and international cooperation for sustainable development. Post-2015 development agenda 214. We reaffirm the centrality of a just, transparent and inclusive intergovernmental negotiation process in the establishment of the post-2015 development agenda, as decided at the special event towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, held in 2013. We stress that this intergovernmental negotiation process will need to focus on its modalities and substantive aspects to arrive at a negotiated and agreed outcome document, taking fully into account the outcomes of the various follow-up processes mandated at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, as well as of the major summits and conferences related to the social, economic and environmental fields. 215. Recalling the statement made at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development that poverty eradication is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, we emphasize that poverty eradication must remain the central and overarching objective of the post-2015 development agenda. We strongly support the view that the post-2015 development agenda should reinforce the commitment of the international community to eradicate poverty by 2030. 216. We underline the need for a coherent approach to the post-2015 development agenda, which should reinforce the commitment of the international community to poverty eradication and the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development in a balanced manner with the contributions of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals, the financing for development process, the Intergovernmental Committee on Experts for Sustainable Development Financing, the process to develop options for a United Nations technology facilitation mechanism and other relevant processes. 217. We reaffirm that the post-2015 development agenda must fully adhere to the Rio Principles, in particular the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. 218. We underscore the importance of strengthening the global partnership for development, to be based on quantified and time-bound targets, consistent with Millennium Development Goal No. 8 and in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in the post-2015 development agenda. North-South cooperation remains the core of this partnership and South-South and triangular cooperation are a useful complement to North-South cooperation. Strengthened commitment from developed countries is therefore required to enhance international cooperation and scale up support for developing countries. We emphasize the need for developed countries to urgently fulfill the official development assistance commitments they have made, individually and collectively, including the target of allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance by 2015 and the target of allocating between 0.15 and 0.20 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance for least developed countries. 219. We emphasize that the post-2015 development agenda must meaningfully address issues of reform of the institutions of global economic governance in order to strengthen the voice and participation of developing countries in decision-making in these institutions. We also note that the global economic, financial and trading systems remain imbalanced, to the disadvantage of developing countries, and in this regard we stress the importance of identifying, in the post-2015 development agenda, the weaknesses and imbalances of these global systems and of proposing actions for improvements with the aim of supporting the development agenda and the programs of developing countries. 220. We affirm the need for a sound implementation mechanism for the post-2015 agenda to ensure development resources for the attainment of goals. In this regard, we call for the intensification of development financing, for the establishment and improvement of mechanisms of technology transfer and for the enhancement of efforts to build the capacities of developing countries. 221. We call for a responsible accountability approach to be adopted on the question of partnerships involving the United Nations, particularly as regards participation of the private sector, civil society and philanthropic entities. In this regard, we reaffirm the need to enhance transparency, coherence and sustainability, as well as accountability to Member States, in United Nations partnerships, and stress the need to ensure that procedures exist for the consideration and approval of any such initiatives by Member States in the General Assembly, in order to preserve the intergovernmental nature of the United Nations. 222. We emphasize that the post-2015 development agenda should be an agenda for development, and in this context it is important to advance economic, social and environmental development in a comprehensive, balanced and coordinated manner. This agenda should be broader than that of the Millennium Development Goals and aim to include areas, issues and groups of populations that are key to achieving sustainable development. 223. We also stress the importance for the post-2015 development agenda, if it is to be global in nature and universally applicable to all, to fully respect the development policy space of developing countries to make use of policy tools and measures that are required to implement their policies for poverty eradication and other developmental plans and programs. We also stress that the post-2015 development agenda should promote rapid, sustained and inclusive economic growth in developing countries as a key requirement for eradicating poverty and hunger and reducing inequalities within and among countries. Part V Particular needs of developing countries in special situations 224. We recall the special needs of Africa, the only continent currently not on track to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. We recognize that, while economic growth is returning, there is a need to sustain the recovery, which is fragile and uneven, to face the ongoing adverse impacts of multiple crises on development and the serious challenges these impacts pose to the fight against poverty and hunger, which could further undermine the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Goals in Africa. 225. We express profound concern about the fact that the commitment to doubling aid to Africa by 2010, as articulated at the summit of the Group of Eight held in Gleneagles, United Kingdom, was not entirely reached, and in this regard we stress the need to make rapid progress in order to fulfill that and other donors' commitments to increase aid through a variety of means, including the provision of new additional resources, the transfer of technology and the building of capacity of African countries, and to support their sustainable development. We call for continued support for Africa's development initiatives, including Agenda 2063 (a continental strategic vision and priority framework for socioeconomic development), the New Partnership for Africa's Development and the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa. On the other hand, we welcome the support that some developing countries have extended to Africa through South-South and triangular cooperation programs. 226. We express concern for the situation in the least developed countries, which continues to deteriorate as a consequence of ongoing multiple and mutually exacerbating global crises. The global financial and economic crisis currently under way is clearly undermining development in the least developed countries. The modest development gains that these countries have made over the years are being reversed, pushing a larger number of their people into extreme poverty. Many least developed countries continue to lag in meeting most of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. We emphasize the need for the full and effective implementation of the commitments made in the Program of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020. We further underline the critical need to realize expeditiously a renewed and strengthened global partnership for the least developed countries in order to overcome their structural challenges, eradicate poverty, achieve internationally agreed development goals and enable half the number of least developed countries to meet the criteria for graduation from the category by 2020. 227. We recall that the unique and particular vulnerabilities of small island developing States have been acknowledged by the international community at various United Nations meetings, including those held in Rio de Janeiro (1992), Barbados (1994), Johannesburg (2002) and Mauritius (2005), and note with concern that insufficient steps have been taken at the international level to address the vulnerabilities and effectively support the sustainable development efforts of such States. We recall that climate change and sea level rise pose the greatest threat to the survival and viability of small island developing States and to their efforts to achieve sustainable development goals, and call on the international community to commit itself to urgently increasing international cooperation to support those efforts, particularly through increased financial resources, capacity-building, transfer of technology and know-how, and increased participation of small island developing States in international economic decision-making. We welcome the decision to convene the third International Conference for Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, to be held in 2014, in Apia, and call for enhanced efforts to assist small island developing States in implementing the Program of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Program of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. We commit to work towards a strong outcome for the Apia conference that supports small island developing States in their sustainable development needs and aspirations. 228. We recognize the special needs of and challenges faced by landlocked developing countries caused by these States' lack of territorial access to the sea, which is aggravated by their remoteness from world markets, and also express concern about the fact that the economic growth and social well-being of landlocked developing countries remain very vulnerable to external shocks and to the multiple challenges the international community faces, including the financial and economic crisis and climate change. We stress the need for the international community to enhance development assistance to landlocked developing countries to help them overcome their vulnerabilities, build resilience and set themselves on a path of sustainable social and economic development. We reaffirm the need to urgently address the special development needs of and challenges faced by landlocked and transit developing countries through their genuine partnership with sufficient support and cooperation from the international community for the effective implementation of priorities of the Almaty Program of Action and its successor program. We welcome the decision of the General Assembly to hold a comprehensive ten-year review conference of the Almaty Program of Action in 2014, and call upon the international community to critically consider the special needs of and the challenges faced by landlocked developing countries, and to help develop priorities for a new, more comprehensive, common action-oriented framework of landlocked developing countries for the next decade. 229. We recognize that middle-income countries still face significant development challenges, and underline that, despite the recent progress achieved and the efforts made by middle-income countries, 75 per cent of the world's poor population lives in those countries. The achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the achievement of full employment and the creation of jobs for youth, the diversification of their economies, and the development of technologies continue to be huge challenges for middle-income countries. We underline the increasing solidarity and role played by middle-income countries in the area of South-South cooperation in support of the development efforts of other developing countries. We also note the outcomes of the High-Level Conference of Middle-Income Countries organized by Costa Rica and UNIDO in June 2013. 230. We stress the need for the United Nations development system to ensure that it addresses the diverse and specific development needs of middle-income countries in a coordinated manner through, inter alia, an accurate assessment of the national priorities and needs of these countries, taking into account the use of variables that go beyond per capita income criteria and recognizing the multidimensional nature of development and poverty, and through adequate, systemic and better-focused support in accordance with national plans. 231. We reiterate our call for the immediate and full withdrawal of Israel, the occupying Power, from the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the occupied Syrian Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 and from the remaining Lebanese occupied land. We reaffirm our support for a Middle East peace process aimed at achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions, including Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 425 (1978) and 1850 (2008), and the principle of land for peace. In this context, we also reaffirm our support for the Arab Peace Initiative adopted by the Council of the League of Arab States in March 2002. 232. We stress the need for the early realization by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination and to the independence of their State of Palestine to allow for their stability, prosperity and development towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, to which all peoples are entitled. We express support for the efforts of the Palestinian people to achieve independence and welcome in this regard the submission by the State of Palestine of its application, on 23 September 2011, for full membership in the United Nations, and notes the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 67/19 of 29 November 2012, by which it accorded to Palestine non-member observer State status in the United Nations. We continue to support the admission process of the State of Palestine to become a full member of the United Nations as soon as possible. We recall that 2014 was declared the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian people. 233. We condemn the ongoing Israeli military occupation of the Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the illegal actions by the occupying Power that continue to cause civilian casualties, socioeconomic and humanitarian hardship and destruction to Palestinian properties, infrastructure and agricultural lands, and to undermine the contiguity, unity and integrity of the Territory. 234. We express deep concern about the further decline of the social and economic conditions of the Palestinian people, particularly in the besieged Gaza Strip, as a result of the illegal Israeli practices, including construction of settlements and the Wall and the imposition of a blockade and hundreds of checkpoints. We call upon Israel, the occupying Power, to cease immediately all illegal measures impairing the Palestinian economy and development, including, in particular, the inhumane and illegal blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip and restrictions on the movement of persons and goods, including commercial trade throughout, into and out of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and to make reparation for all damages caused to Palestinian properties, institutions and infrastructure. We reiterate our call upon the international community to continue providing much needed developmental and humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people during this critical period, particularly for reconstruction and economic recovery in the Gaza Strip. 235. We reaffirm the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and of the population of the occupied Syrian Golan over their natural resources, including land, water and energy resources, and demand that Israel, the occupying Power, cease the exploitation, damage, cause of loss or depletion and endangerment of the natural resources in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan. 236. We reaffirm the need for the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to resume negotiations in accordance with the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, in order to find, as soon as possible, a peaceful solution to the sovereignty dispute relating to the question of the Malvinas Islands, which seriously damages the economic capacities of Argentina, and the need for both parties to refrain from taking decisions that would imply introducing unilateral modifications in the situation while the islands are going through the process recommended by the General Assembly. 237. We reaffirm the need to find a peaceful solution to the sovereignty issues facing developing countries, including the dispute over the Chagos archipelago, including Diego Garcia, which was unlawfully excised by the United Kingdom from the territory of Mauritius, prior to independence, in violation of international law and General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 2066 (XX) of 16 December 1965. Failure to resolve these decolonization and sovereignty issues would seriously damage and undermine the development and economic capacities and prospects of developing countries. In this regard, we note with great concern that despite the strong opposition of Mauritius, the United Kingdom purported to establish a "marine protected area" around the Chagos archipelago, which contravenes international law and further impedes the exercise by Mauritius of its sovereign rights over the archipelago and the right of return of Mauritius citizens who were forcibly removed from the archipelago by the United Kingdom. 238. We take note of the Havana Declaration adopted at the Second Summit of the Community of the Latin American and Caribbean States, held on 28 and 29 January 2014. 239. We reaffirm our firm rejection of the imposition of laws and regulations with extraterritorial impact and all other forms of coercive economic measures, including unilateral sanctions, against developing countries, and reiterate the urgent need to eliminate them immediately. We emphasize that such actions not only undermine the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and international law, but also severely threaten the freedom of trade and investment. We therefore call on the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries. 240. We express our rejection of unilateral lists and certifications by some developed countries affecting developing countries, in particular those referring to terrorism, drug trafficking, trafficking in persons and others of a similar nature. 241. We reiterate our call, made at the second South Summit, organized by the Group of 77 and China and held in Doha in 2005, for the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba, which, in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law, as well as to the principle of neighborliness, causes huge material losses and economic damage to the people of Cuba. We urge strict compliance to the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly on this matter. We also take note that in the Havana Declaration, the Heads of State and Government of the Community of the Latin American and Caribbean States reaffirmed their strongest rejection of the implementation of unilateral coercive measures and once again reiterated their solidarity with Cuba, while reaffirming their call upon the Government of the United States to put an end to the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on that sisterly nation for more than five decades. They rejected the inclusion of Cuba in the list of States sponsors of terrorism published by the State Department of the United States, and requested that an end be put to that unilateral practice. 242. We reaffirm our rejection to the unilateral economic sanctions imposed on the Sudan, which have a negative impact on the development and prosperity of the people of the Sudan, and in this regard call for an immediate lifting of those sanctions.
Part I
Overall context 1. We, the Heads of State and Government of the member States of the Group of 77 and China, have gathered in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Plurinational State of Bolivia, for the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the Group. 2. We commemorate the formation of the Group of 77 on 15 June 1964 and recall the ideals and principles contained in the historic Joint Declaration of the Seventy-Seven Developing Countries, signed at the end of the first session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), held in Geneva. 3. We recall that the first ever statement of the Group of 77 pledged to promote equality in the international economic and social order and promote the interests of the developing world, declared their unity under a common interest and defined the Group as "an instrument for enlarging the area of cooperative endeavor in the international field and for securing mutually beneficent relationships with the rest of the world". 4. We also recall the first Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77, held in Algiers from 10 to 25 October 1964, at which the Group adopted the Charter of Algiers, which established the principles of unity, complementarity, cooperation and solidarity of the developing countries and their determination to strive for economic and social development, individually or collectively. 5. We highlight that the Group of 77 has provided the means for the countries of the South to articulate and promote their collective social and economic interests and enhanced their joint negotiating capacity within the United Nations system, and note with satisfaction that the Group has established a permanent secretariat at United Nations Headquarters in New York and chapters in Geneva, Nairobi, Paris, Rome, Vienna and the Group of 24 in Washington, D.C., and that its membership now stands at 133 member States. 6. We also recall the successful holding of the first South Summit of the Group of 77 and China in Havana in April 2000 and the second South Summit in Doha in June 2005, at which the status of the Group of 77 and China was elevated to the level of Heads of State and Government and at which important declarations and plans of action were adopted that have guided our Group and constitute the fundamental basis for the construction of a new world order and an agenda owned by the countries of the South for the establishment of a more just, democratic and equal system that benefits our peoples. 7. We pledge to continue the tradition of our countries on building national development and uniting at the international level, towards the establishment of a just international order in the world economy that supports developing countries achieve our objectives of sustained economic growth, full employment, social equity, provision of basic goods and services to our people, protection of the environment and living in harmony with nature. 8. We are proud of the legacy and great achievements of the Group of 77 and China in defending and promoting the interest of the developing countries over the past 50 years, which have contributed gradually to greater strength and influence on economic, social and environmental issues. We pledge to build on this foundation and continue making progress towards a world order that is just, equitable, stable and peaceful. Major landmarks in this regard have been the adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order in 1974, the Declaration on the Right to Development in 1986 and several other historic declarations that recognize and address the needs and interests of developing countries and constitute an utmost priority. 9. We believe in the peaceful settlement of conflicts through dialogue. 10. We also note that, despite five decades of achievements, there are still serious shortfalls in fulfilling our Group's objectives, and that our countries individually and collectively now face ongoing and emerging challenges, including the slowdown of the global economy and its effects on our countries and the lack of adequate systemic action and accountability to address the causes and effects of the global financial and economic crises, thus creating the risk of continuing with the pattern of crisis cycles. 11. We also note the gaps in many of our countries in meeting the needs of employment, food, water, health care, education, housing, physical infrastructure and energy of our people, as well as the looming environmental crisis, including the negative impacts of climate change in developing countries, the increasing shortage of drinking water and the loss of biodiversity. 12. We stress that imbalances in the global economy and the inequitable structures and outcomes in the trading, financial, monetary and technological systems led to the establishment of our Group. Nevertheless, these imbalances still prevail today in some ways with even more adverse effects on developing countries. Therefore, we pledge to continue and intensify our efforts to strive for a fair, just and equitable international order oriented towards the fulfillment of the development needs of developing countries. 13. We emphasize that the rationale for the establishment of our Group 50 years ago remains actual and valid, and indeed more valid, than at that time. We therefore rededicate ourselves and our countries to strengthening and expanding the unwavering efforts of the Group of 77 and China in all fields towards greater achievement and for the betterment of the lives of our people. 14. We affirm that the twenty-first century is the time for the countries and the peoples from the South to develop their economies and societies in order to fulfill human needs sustainably, in harmony with nature and respect for Mother Earth and its ecosystems. We agree to build on our traditional values and practices of solidarity and collaboration for mutual benefit and on the strength of our people, to achieve progress in our countries and in South-South cooperation. 15. We emphasize that our major priorities are promoting sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, and promoting the integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems that supports, inter alia, economic, social and human development while facilitating ecosystem conservation, regeneration and restoration and resilience in the face of new and emerging challenges. 16. We reaffirm that the main strength of the Group of 77 has been and will be its unity and solidarity, its vision of fair, just and equitable multilateral relations, the commitment of its member States to the well-being and prosperity of the peoples of the South as well as our commitment to mutually beneficial cooperation. 17. We emphasize that each country has the sovereign right to decide its own development priorities and strategies and consider that there is no "one size fits all" approach. We stress the need for international rules to allow policy space and policy flexibility for developing countries, as they are directly related to the development strategies of national Governments. We further emphasize the need for policy space to enable our countries to formulate development strategies expressing national interests and differing needs which are not always taken into account by international economic policymaking in the process of integration with the global economy. 18. We are concerned about the current state of the global economy and the state of global economic governance and the need for strong recovery. We believe that the world is confronted with the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression, and we are alarmed by the adverse effects this crisis is having especially on developing countries. We believe the crisis has highlighted long-standing systemic fragilities and imbalances in the global economy, and further exposed the inadequacy and undemocratic nature of global economic governance. New attempts must now be made to establish proper global economic governance, with the full voice, representation and participation of developing countries in discussions and decision-making. 19. We recognize the high importance of sustaining social protection and fostering job creation even in times of economic crisis, and take note with satisfaction of the encouraging examples of policies that allow countries to reduce poverty, increase social inclusion and create new and better jobs in recent years. 20. We view with concern the increased concentration and the asymmetric distribution of wealth and income in the world, which have created wide inequality between developed and developing countries. This level of inequality is unjustifiable and cannot be tolerated in a world where poverty is still prevalent, resources are being depleted and environmental degradation is increasing. We call for global actions to reduce inequalities at all levels. We also pledge to address inequality in our own countries. 21. We note with concern the influence of large corporations, mainly from developed countries, on the global economy, and its negative effects on the social, economic and environmental development of some developing countries, particularly regarding the barriers this may pose for the entry of new enterprises in the global market. In this regard, we call for concrete measures from the international community to address these negative effects and to promote international competition and increased market access for developing countries, including policies that foster the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, the removal of trade barriers that inhibit value addition in origin countries, such as tariff peaks and tariff escalation, as well as capacity-building on competition law, tax policy regulations and social corporate responsibility. 22. We emphasize that transnational corporations have a responsibility to respect all human rights and should refrain from causing environmental disasters and affecting the well-being of peoples. 23. We recognize the progress achieved in sustainable development at the regional, national, subnational and local levels and we reaffirm the importance of supporting developing countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty by empowering the poor and people in vulnerable situations, promoting developing sustainable agriculture as well as full and productive employment and decent work for all, complemented by effective social policies, including social protection floors. 24. We fully respect the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, particularly as they relate to equality among States, respect for the independence of States, national sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of States, and stress that those principles and purposes inspire our full commitment to multilateralism and the search for a more just and equitable international economic system that offers opportunities to raise the standard of living of our peoples. 25. We are deeply aware that decades after political independence, some developing countries are still in the grip of economic dependence on the structures and vagaries of the global economy and on the developed countries and their economic entities. Such dependence, especially by poor and vulnerable countries, limits the extent of our real political independence as well. Therefore, we pledge to unite our efforts to continue striving for economic independence and to gather under the umbrella of the Group of 77 and China as well as other organizations of the South to make progress on this. 26. We recall the decisions taken at the second South Summit in Doha (2005) to work to ensure that programs and policies designed in the context of globalization fully respect the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, particularly as they relate to equality among States, respect for the independence of States, national sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of States, and to stress that those principles and purposes inspire our full commitment to multilateralism and the search for a more just and equitable international economic system that offers opportunities to raise the standard of living of our peoples. 27. We also recall the decision taken at the Group of 77 and China Summit in Doha (2005) to work towards the realization of the right to self-determination of peoples living under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation, which adversely affects their social and economic development, and to call on the international community to take all necessary measures to bring an end to the continuation of foreign occupation, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. 28. We reaffirm that indigenous peoples have the right to maintain and strengthen their distinct political, legal, economic, social and cultural institutions, while retaining their right to participate fully, if they so choose, in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the State. In this regard, we emphasize the need to respect and safeguard indigenous cultural identities, knowledge and traditions in our countries.
Part II
Development in the national context
Approaches for sustainable development 29. We stress the need to further mainstream sustainable development at all levels, integrating economic, social and environmental aspects and recognizing their interlinkages, so as to achieve sustainable development in all its dimensions. 30. We reaffirm that there are different approaches, visions, models and tools available to each country, in accordance with its national circumstances and priorities to achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions, which is our overarching goal (United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development). In some countries there is an approach of "living well" as holistic development aimed at achieving the material, cultural and spiritual needs of societies in a context of harmony with nature. 31. We acknowledge that the Earth and its ecosystems are our home and we are convinced that, in order to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environmental needs of present and future generations, it is necessary to promote harmony with nature and the Earth. We also recognize that "Mother Earth" is a common expression for planet Earth in a number of countries and regions, which reflects the interdependence that exists among human beings, other living species and the planet we all inhabit. 32. We welcome the celebration held in 2011 of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development, which is a major landmark document that establishes the right of developing countries to act to achieve development and the right of people to participate in and benefit from development. 33. In this context, we reaffirm that development is a comprehensive economic, social, cultural and political process that aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom as recognized in the Declaration on the Right to Development. 34. We further reaffirm the proclamation in the Declaration on the Right to Development that the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized as recognized in the Declaration. Improving the practice of democracy 35. We consider that democracy is a universal value based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives. We reaffirm that while all democracies share common features, there is no single model of democracy and that democracy does not belong to any country or region, and further reaffirm the necessity of due respect for sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity and the right to self-determination, and the rejection of any attempt to break down constitutional and democratic order legitimately established by the peoples. 36. We call for an end to the use of media in any way that might disseminate distorted information against States members of the Group of 77 in complete disregard of the principle of international law. 37. We express our deep indignation and rejection with regard to the facts related to the surprise withdrawal of overflight and landing permits for the presidential aircraft on which President Evo Morales Ayma of the Plurinational State of Bolivia and his party were travelling on 2 July 2013. These facts constitute unfriendly and unjustifiable acts that have also put at serious risk the safety of President Morales. We make public our greater solidarity and demand clarification of facts. National sovereignty and benefits over natural resources 38. We affirm that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. 39. We also reaffirm that the right of peoples and nations to permanent sovereignty over the natural wealth and resources must be exercised in the interest of their national development and of the well-being of the people of the State concerned. 40. While emphasizing the sovereignty of our countries and peoples over their natural wealth, we are also aware of our duty to conserve and sustainably manage and use these resources and ensure the conditions for nature and ecosystems to have the capacity to regenerate, for the benefit of present and future generations. We also recognize that the sustainable use of natural resources is an effective way to achieve economic growth while reducing poverty and environmental degradation. 41. We take note of and respect the decisions of some countries that decided to nationalize or to reclaim control of their natural resources in order to obtain greater benefits for their people, especially the poor, and to invest in the economic diversification, industrialization and social programs. 42. We urge that technical and capacity-building assistance be provided to developing countries at the international, regional and national levels to support them in obtaining the maximum benefits from the extraction and use of those resources in line with sustainable development, taking into account the full exercise of the sovereign right of our countries over their natural resources. Eradication of poverty 43. We recognize that poverty is an affront to human dignity and stress that poverty eradication is the greatest global challenge facing the world today, and we attach the highest priority to poverty eradication in the United Nations post-2015 development agenda to be supported by effective and adequate means of implementation and strengthened global partnership for development, and which entails, among other objectives, the promotion of employment and decent work for all, the improvement of access to social services, the eradication of illiteracy and diseases as well as integrated, coordinated and coherent national and regional strategies. 44. We express our deep concern for the constraints on the fight against poverty arising from the crises, in particular the world financial and economic crisis, the continuing food insecurity, the volatility of capital flows and the extreme volatility of commodity prices, energy accessibility and the challenges posed by climate change to developing countries. 45. We further stress that, in order to enable Governments of developing countries to effectively eradicate poverty, developing countries must ensure national ownership of their own development agenda, which entails preserving their own policy space backed by a strong political commitment to reduce poverty in line with their national priorities and circumstances. As such, Governments of developing countries must formulate their own development strategies to assist the poor through policies and actions, including on, but not limited to, strong, sustained and inclusive economic growth, the generation of employment as a priority, in particular for the young population, the improvement of the provision of universal and affordable access to basic services, the provision of a well-designed social protection system, the empowerment of individuals to seize economic opportunities, and measures to ensure the protection of the environment. 46. We recall the United Nations Convention against Corruption, which is the most comprehensive and universal instrument on corruption, and we recognize the need to continue promoting ratification of or accession to the Convention and its full implementation. We also recognize that fighting corruption at all levels is a priority and that corruption is a serious barrier to effective resource mobilization and allocation and diverts resources away from activities that are vital for poverty eradication and sustainable development. 47. We take note with appreciation of the ancestral and traditional values of some of our peoples such as the Andean principles of Ama Suwa ("do not be a thief"), Ama Llulla ("do not be a liar") and Ama Qhilla ("do not be lazy"), which in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms contribute to efforts to prevent and tackle corruption. Reducing inequality 48. We emphasize that the problem of inequality is even more acute today than ever because of the prevalence of extreme wealth while poverty and hunger continue to exist and this is aggravated, inter alia, by unsustainable patterns of consumption and production mainly in developed countries. We affirm that any benefit from economic growth has to be equitably shared and must benefit the people in vulnerable situations in our communities, and we therefore call once again for concerted actions to reduce inequalities at all levels. 49. We are gravely concerned at the inadequacy of measures to narrow the widening gap between the developed and the developing countries, and within countries, which has contributed to, inter alia, deepening poverty and has adversely affected the full enjoyment of all human rights, in particular in developing countries. 50. We also note with concern that high levels of inequality within and among countries continue to have a negative impact on all aspects of human development and are especially harmful to people in vulnerable situations who are affected by intersecting inequalities. We therefore urge countries, including through the support of international cooperation, to scale up efforts to provide equal access to opportunities and outcomes to all levels of society in accordance with national policies. 51. We understand that sustainable development involves a change in the order of priorities from the generation of material wealth to the satisfaction of human needs in harmony with nature. The excessive orientation towards profit neither respects Mother Earth nor takes into account human needs. The continuation of this unequal system will lead to further inequality. Sustained and inclusive economic growth 52. We affirm that sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth is necessary to eradicate poverty, provide jobs and raise the living standards of our people and generate public revenues to finance social policies. We note that historical evidence has shown that no country has ever achieved constant improvements in living standards and human development without sustaining a steady pace of economic growth. We therefore urge the international community and the United Nations to assist developing countries in attaining high and adequate economic growth over a sustained period. 53. We also realize that high economic growth, although necessary, is not sufficient in itself. We realize that economic growth must be sustained and inclusive by generating jobs and lifting the incomes of peoples in vulnerable situations, especially the poor and the most in need. Economic growth should also be environmentally and socially sound and, to achieve this, developing countries require, among other sources, financial and technological support from developed countries according to national plans. Creation of employment 54. We express the view that the capacity to generate full employment and decent work is fundamentally linked to reviving and enhancing productive development strategies, through adequate finance, investment and trade policies. In this regard, we reaffirm the need for significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources and the effective use of financing, in order to give strong support to developing countries in their efforts to promote sustainable development. We also stress the need to maintain coherence between macroeconomic and job creation policies in order to ensure inclusive and resilient global economic growth. 55. We are deeply concerned about the continuing high levels of unemployment and underemployment, particularly among young people, and affirm our commitment to reducing unemployment through employment-intensive macroeconomic and development policies. We affirm the need to launch an intergovernmental process, within the United Nations, to include the issue of youth employment and youth concerns in the current process of the post-2015 development agenda. We also affirm the importance of ensuring decent livelihoods for farmers in our countries. 56. We affirm the need to launch an intergovernmental process within the United Nations to develop a global strategy on improving employment skills and generating youth employment. Providing basic services for our people 57. We are concerned that there remains a substantial and increasing gap between the world's rich and poor, which is due not only to an unequal distribution of income, but also to unequal access to basic resources and services, which hinders the creation of economic opportunities for all. 58. We recognize that the State has an essential role to play to ensure that basic services are accessible to all and to address the unequal and discriminatory distribution of and access to them. 59. We also reaffirm our resolve to act to implement the right of our people to access basic services. 60. We reaffirm our commitments regarding the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, to be progressively implemented and realized for our populations with full respect for national sovereignty. 61. We call upon donor countries and international organizations to advance in the provision of financial resources, capacity-building and technology transfer, through international assistance to and cooperation with developing countries, in order to scale up efforts to provide safe, clean, accessible and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all. Access to public health and medicines 62. We recognize that universal health coverage means that everyone has access, without discrimination, to a set of basic medical services of promotion, prevention, cure and rehabilitation that meet the needs and are determined nationally, as well as to essential quality, safe, affordable and effective medicines while ensuring that the use of these services does not entail serious economic difficulties for users, especially people in vulnerable situations. 63. We also recognize that many developing countries do not have the financial or human resources or the infrastructure to implement the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Therefore, we call upon developed countries and relevant international organizations to provide the adequate financial resources and technology to developing countries that will complement their efforts to have policies and measures that provide universal health coverage and basic health services for all. 64. We note with great concern that non-communicable diseases have become an epidemic of significant proportions, undermining the sustainable development of member States. In that sense, we acknowledge the effectiveness of tobacco control measures for the improvement of health. We reaffirm the right of member States to protect public health and, in particular, to ensure universal access to medicines and medical diagnostic technologies, if necessary, including through the full use of the flexibilities in the Doha Declaration on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) and Public Health. 65. We recall paragraph 142 of the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, in which Heads of State and Government reaffirmed the right to use, to the fullest extent, the provisions contained in the TRIPS Agreement, the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, the decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization (WTO) of 30 August 2003 on the implementation of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration and, when formal acceptance procedures are completed, the amendment to article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement, which provide flexibilities for the protection of public health, and in particular to promote access to medicines for all and encourage the provision of assistance to developing countries in this regard. We affirm the importance of taking advantage of the use of TRIPS flexibilities in order to promote the people's health and access to medicines. We call upon developed countries to fully respect the right of developing countries to make full use of TRIPS flexibilities and to refrain from taking actions, including trade measures, to prevent or dissuade developing countries from exercising this right. 66. We are concerned about the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance to existing drugs, including those against tuberculosis and malaria. As a result, increasing numbers of patients, especially in developing countries, face the prospect of dying from preventable and/or treatable diseases. We urge the international health authorities and organizations, especially the World Health Organization (WHO), to take urgent action and to work together upon request with developing countries that do not have adequate resources to address this problem. Agricultural development and food security 67. We recall that food security and nutrition are essential elements for achieving sustainable development and express concern that developing countries are vulnerable to, among others, the adverse impacts of climate change, further threatening food security. 68. We reaffirm that hunger is a violation of human dignity and call for urgent measures to be taken at the national, regional and international levels to eliminate it. We also reaffirm the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food in accordance with their right to adequate food and the fundamental right to be free from hunger, in order to develop and maintain their full physical and mental capacities. We also acknowledge that food security and nutrition are essential to sustainable development and have become a pressing global challenge and, in this regard, we further reaffirm our commitment to enhancing food security and access to adequate, safe and nutritious food for present and future generations in line with the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, including for children under the age of 2, and through, as appropriate, national, regional and global food security and nutrition strategies. 69. We denounce that subsidies and other market distortions driven by developed countries have seriously affected the agricultural sector of developing countries, limiting the ability of this key sector to significantly contribute to the eradication of poverty and to sustained, inclusive economic growth and equitable, sustainable development, food security and rural development. We call for the immediate elimination of all forms of agricultural subsidies and other market-distorting measures taken by developed countries that are not in compliance with WTO rules. We urge developed countries to show flexibility and political will to adequately address these fundamental concerns of developing countries in the Doha Round of trade negotiations. 70. We reiterate our commitment to conclude multilateral disciplines on fisheries subsidies which give effect to the WTO Doha Development Agenda and the Hong Kong ministerial mandates to strengthen disciplines on subsidies in the fisheries sector, including through the prohibition of certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the WTO fisheries subsidies negotiation, taking into account the importance of the sector to development priorities, poverty reduction, and livelihood and food security concerns. 71. We emphasize the need to strengthen the capacity of our countries, especially through international cooperation, to safeguard and enhance our people's nutrition through the promotion of their productive cultural and environmental practices. 72. We also emphasize the urgent need to increase efforts at the national, regional and international levels to address food security and agriculture development as an integral part of the international development agenda. We demand sustained funding and increased targeted investment to enhance world food production and call for new and additional financial resources from all sources to achieve sustainable agriculture development and food security. 73. We further emphasize the need to strengthen the agricultural sector as part of the post-2015 agenda with its means of implementation, to achieve food security, stressing the importance of including the knowledge, practices and technologies of indigenous peoples, rural communities and small- and medium-scale farmers in national, regional and international strategies aimed at achieving food security. 74. We welcome the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 68/177 on the right to food and resolution 68/233 on agricultural development, food security and nutrition. We also welcome the Second International Conference on Nutrition, organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WHO, to be held at FAO headquarters in Rome from 19 to 21 November 2014, which aims to approve the nutrition policy framework for the coming decades and to determine priorities for international cooperation in the field of nutrition in the short and medium term. 75. We welcome the decision of the Director General of FAO to appoint for the second year Evo Morales Ayma, President of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and Nadine Heredia Alarcón, First Lady of Peru, as Special Ambassadors of Quinoa, recognizing their leadership and commitment in the fight against hunger and malnutrition and that the Bolivian and Peruvian Governments showed the world the benefits and quality of that Andean food source. 76. We reaffirm that quinoa's biodiversity and nutritional value make it central to providing food security and nutrition and to eradicating poverty, as well as to promoting the traditional knowledge of the Andean indigenous peoples, contributing to the achievement of food security, nutrition and poverty eradication and raising awareness of their contribution to social, economic and environmental development, and sharing good practices on implementation. 77. We call for the creation of conditions for the development of economic opportunities for the benefit of small-scale and family farmers, peasant and indigenous peoples and communities, and the creation of options for connecting them with consumers, as part of the national strategies for the realization of the right to food. 78. We recognize the positive role of small-scale and family farmers, including women, cooperatives, indigenous peoples and local communities in developing countries, and their knowledge and practices, in the conservation and sustainable use of seeds, agrobiodiversity and biodiversity associated with food production of present and future generations. 79. We stress the need to address the root causes of excessive food price volatility, including its structural causes, at all levels, and the need to manage the risks linked to excessively volatile prices in agricultural commodities and their consequences for global food security and nutrition, as well as for small-scale farmers and poor urban dwellers. 80. We call for the prioritization of development in the WTO Doha Round of negotiations in accordance with the Doha Development Agenda, including food security. We call for the promotion of the livelihoods of small-scale farmers and rural development in developing countries. In this context, we urge WTO members to adopt a permanent solution to the issue of public stock holding and food security for developing countries, as agreed by the WTO Ministerial Decision adopted in Bali, Indonesia, in 2013, as soon as possible. Sustainable family farming 81. We declare that family farms and small farms are an important basis for sustainable food production aimed at achieving food security (General Assembly resolution 66/222). In this framework, support should be given to the economic activities of sustainable family farming, taking into account the traditional knowledge of such farmers, in order to improve their situation and development, in particular promoting their access to financial services, productive resources and agricultural inputs such as land, seeds, appropriate technology, transport and information. 82. We will promote comprehensive and complementary national and regional actions for production, access and consumption based on integral, multisectoral and participatory planning, reassessing and strengthening sustainable family farming, small-scale farmers, indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants. Industrialization and infrastructure 83. We affirm that industrial development and value addition, together with science, technology and innovation, are, among others, essential elements for developing countries to attain higher development levels in a sustained way, as the industrialization process can generate higher productivity, more jobs and skills and positive spillover effects on the economy. Therefore, we urge developed countries to assist developing countries in boosting industrialization in their development strategies and policies and in promoting inclusive sustainable industrial development, in accordance with their national interests. 84. We note that many developing countries are still overly dependent on commodities and that they should explore industrial diversification strategies by, inter alia, enhancing value-adding productive capacities. 85. We call on relevant international organizations and request international cooperation mechanisms to provide adequate assistance to developing countries, including through technology transfer, to develop their capacities to design and implement industrialization strategies and policies, in accordance with their national priorities. 86. We call for the international trading system to respect and reinforce the policy space of developing countries for the promotion and growth of our industrial development and for the design and implementation of our industrial strategies. In this regard, we call for the revision of all rules within the world trading system that affect the policy space of developing countries. 87. We affirm that the development of reliable and affordable infrastructure, regional connectivity, and its appropriate interlinkage through science, technology and innovation, including transport, roads, energy and telecommunications, as well as the promotion of market access for exports coming from developing countries, are essential elements in improving the quality of life of our people and in the sustainable development of our countries. 88. In this regard, we urge developed countries and international organizations, in accordance with internationally agreed commitments, to provide adequate financial assistance to support the transfer of reliable and affordable technologies and to promote capacity-building, taking into account national priorities. 89. We urge developed countries to provide technical assistance, technology transfer and financial resources to enable our countries to industrialize and develop our infrastructure in ways that are environmentally sustainable. 90. We emphasize in this regard the importance of technical assistance for industrial development in member States with the aim of adopting cleaner, resource-based and energy-efficient sustainable consumption and production patterns, including cleaner fossil fuel technologies. 91. We welcome the initiative of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, as Chair of the Group of 77 and China, to organize the Meeting of Ministers of Industrialization and counterparts on the issue of governance of natural resources and industrialization, in coordination with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Economic Commission for Africa, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, to take place in Tarija in August 2014. 92. We welcome the Lima Declaration: Towards Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development, which was adopted at the fifteenth session of the General Conference of UNIDO, held in Lima in December 2013, as an important step in our common endeavours to achieve sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. Inclusion of women in development 93. We recall the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, reaffirm the vital role of women and the need for full and equal opportunities for their participation and leadership in all areas of sustainable development, and decide to accelerate the implementation of our respective commitments in this regard as contained in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, as well as in Agenda 21, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the Program of Action of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development. 94. We also recognize that the potential of women to engage in, contribute to and benefit from sustainable development as leaders, participants and agents of change has not been fully realized. We support prioritizing measures to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in all spheres of our societies. We resolve to unlock the potential of women as drivers of sustainable development through many measures and commit to creating an enabling environment for improving the situation of women and girls everywhere, particularly in rural areas and local communities and among indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities. 95. We are committed to ensure equal rights and opportunities for women in political and economic decision-making and resource allocation, to give women equal rights with men to economic resources, and to ensure access to education, finance, information and communications technologies, markets, legal assistance and other basic services, including health-care services, including safe, effective, affordable and acceptable modern methods of family planning. 96. We recall our respective commitments under General Assembly resolution 61/143 and other relevant resolutions on this matter, recognize that violence against women seriously violates all human rights of women, and therefore agree to take action to eliminate all forms of violence, including feminicide and discrimination against women and girls, by means of a more systematic, comprehensive, multisectoral and sustained approach, adequately supported and facilitated by strong institutional mechanisms and financing, through national action plans, including those supported by international cooperation and, where appropriate, national development plans, including poverty eradication strategies and program-based and sector-wide approaches. 97. We reaffirm the commitment to work together towards a post-2015 development agenda with a gender perspective. 98. We urge the need to tackle critical remaining challenges for women and girls through a transformative and comprehensive approach and call for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls to be reflected as a stand-alone sustainable development goal and to be integrated through targets with inclusive policies to overcome poverty and foster social and economic development in our countries. Indigenous peoples 99. We urge efforts towards the implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands, natural resources, identity and culture, in accordance with national legislation. We reaffirm our respective commitments to implement our legal obligations, including, as appropriate, Convention No. 169 of the International Labour Organization, as well as to promote the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 100. We reaffirm the value and the diversity of the cultures and the forms of social organization of indigenous peoples and their holistic traditional scientific knowledge, innovations and practices, which play a significant role in strengthening the livelihoods of the local populations, ensuring food security and addressing climate change. 101. We stress the importance of indigenous peoples in the achievement of sustainable development in developing countries and their critical role in the social, economic and political processes of our countries, while strengthening the local views and values referred to as the holistic views of Mother Earth. 102. We reaffirm the importance of the role of collective action and the efforts of indigenous and local communities in conserving biodiversity, considering their critical role in the stewardship and sustainable management of natural renewable resources. 103. We consider that mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are contingent upon different sociocultural contexts, taking particular account of indigenous peoples and local communities and their traditional knowledge systems and practices, including their holistic view of community and environment, as a major means of adapting to climate change. 104. We call for strengthening the interscientific dialogue between traditional and indigenous knowledge systems with modern sciences in the context of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and of the conceptual framework of "Living well in balance and harmony with Mother Earth", approved by the Platform. 105. We welcome the convening of the high-level plenary meeting of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, to be known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, to be held in New York on 22 and 23 September 2014, with the purpose of sharing insights and best practices on the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The action-oriented outcome document of this Conference should contribute to the realization of the rights of indigenous peoples and the pursuit of the objectives of the Declaration, and promote the achievement of all internationally agreed development goals. 106. We take note of the Special Declaration on the Coca Leaf of the Heads of State and Government of the Latin American and Caribbean States within the framework of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, held in Havana on 29 January 2014, which acknowledges the importance of preserving the cultural and traditional practices of indigenous peoples in the context of respecting all their human and fundamental rights, in conformity with the relevant international instruments. In this context, the Heads of State and Government recognize coca leaf chewing (akuliku, or chacchado) as an ancestral cultural manifestation of the people of the Andean region that must be respected by the international community and express interest in knowing the results of scientific research conducted by renowned institutes and universities of the international community on the properties of the coca leaf.
Part III
South-South cooperation 107. We reaffirm the Nairobi outcome document of the High-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation, therefore recognize the importance and different history and particularities of South-South cooperation, and reaffirm our view of South-South cooperation as a manifestation of solidarity among peoples and countries of the South that contributes to their national well-being, their national and collective self-reliance and the attainment of internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. South-South cooperation and its agenda have to be set by countries of the South and should continue to be guided by the principles of respect for national sovereignty, national ownership and independence, equality, non-conditionality, non-interference in domestic affairs and mutual benefit. 108. We reaffirm the importance of strengthening South-South cooperation, especially in the current international economic environment, and reiterate our support for South-South cooperation as a strategy to sustain the development efforts of developing countries and as a means of enhancing their participation in the global economy. We reiterate the position of the Group that South-South cooperation is a complement to, rather than a substitute for, North-South cooperation and reaffirm that South-South cooperation is a collective endeavor of developing countries based on the principle of solidarity and premises, conditions and objectives that are specific to the historic and political context of developing countries and to their needs and expectations, and that as such, South-South cooperation deserves its own separate and independent promotion, as reaffirmed in the Nairobi outcome document. In this context, we stress that South-South cooperation and its agenda must be driven by the countries of the South. As such, South-South cooperation, which is critical for developing countries, requires long-term vision and a global institutional arrangement, as envisioned by the Second South Summit. 109. We welcome the convening of the High-level Panel of Eminent Personalities of the South in Natadola, Fiji, from 7 to 9 May 2013, in accordance with the relevant mandate of the second South Summit. We also welcome the Panel's conclusions and recommendations on the future landscape of South-South cooperation as an important contribution to the further development of the Development Platform for the South. We reiterate the framework and principles of South-South cooperation first endorsed by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 at their 32nd annual meeting, held in New York on 26 September 2008, which the Panel also used as a basis for their discussions. 110. We welcome the conclusion of the third round of the Global System of Trade Preferences, which is a tool to promote and strengthen South-South trade integration, and call upon more developing countries to participate in the Global System. 111. We also note and welcome the increase in regional cooperation initiatives that concretely manifest South-South cooperation and integration in various areas, such as finance, banking, trade, health care and food production. We hope that these initiatives will benefit not only the participants of the regional programs but also other developing countries. We call for further initiatives in the future, as well as concrete ways in which developing countries can share experiences and good practices so as to spread these South-South initiatives. 112. We encourage our countries to exchange experiences and best practices with regard to the equal access by all to basic services. 113. We stress that the High-level Committee on South-South Cooperation of the General Assembly is the central multilateral policymaking body in the United Nations system to review and assess global and system-wide progress and support for South-South development cooperation, including triangular cooperation, and to provide overall guidance on future directions. 114. We also stress that South-South cooperation, as an important element of international cooperation for development, is not a substitute for, but is rather a complement to, North-South cooperation and its agenda has to be set by countries of the South. We support the integration of South-South and triangular cooperation in the policies and strategic framework of funds and programs of the United Nations system, as well as its strengthening through the system-wide provision of additional resources, including through financial and human resources to the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, and recognize that the Office, currently hosted by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), constitutes a separate entity with a distinct legal nature, entrusted with the coordination on a global and United Nations system-wide basis for promoting and facilitating initiatives related to South-South cooperation for development. 115. In this regard, we request the establishment of a more formalized and strengthened inter-agency mechanism for the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, with a view to encouraging joint support for South-South and triangular initiatives, as well as sharing information on development activities and results achieved by various funds, agencies and organizations in support ofSouth-South and triangular cooperation. 116. We also call upon the United Nations development system to promote transfer of technologies from developed countries for the benefit of developing countries to address issues of poverty eradication and sustainable development, and in this context encourage, when possible, technology cooperation among the countries of the South. 117. We acknowledge the role played by the South Centre in supporting the Group of 77. We call upon the members of the Group to further support the Centre and call upon the Centre to expand its activities for the benefit of developing countries. We encourage organizations of developing countries, including the South Centre, to come up with ideas and suggest action plans to further operationalize South-South cooperation.
Part IV
Global challenges Global partnership for development 118. We stress the need for a new and stronger commitment by developed countries to international cooperation aimed at supporting the fulfillment of the development aspirations of developing countries. As part of the Millennium Development Goals, a commitment was made to a global partnership for development, which was the international cooperation dimension of the Millennium Development Goals framework. However, we note with concern the significant shortfall in the partnership under the Goals, which contributed to the lack of achievement of many goals and targets. We therefore call for the urgent implementation of all commitments under the global partnership for development so as to overcome the gaps identified in the reports of the Millennium Development Goals Gap Task Force. 119. We also call upon leaders of the developed countries to agree and commit to a new phase of international cooperation through a strengthened and scaled-up global partnership for development, which should be the centerpiece and anchor for both the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda. Such an enhanced global partnership should include the issues of providing financial resources to developing countries, official development assistance, debt relief and debt restructuring, trade, technology transfer and greater participation of developing countries in global economic governance. Official development assistance 120. We reaffirm that official development assistance remains the main source of international financing for many developing countries and that it is essential as a catalyst for development, facilitating the achievement of national development objectives, including the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals, the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda, in accordance with paragraph 246 of the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development ("The future we want"). 121. We stress that developed countries must meet and scale up their existing official development assistance commitments and targets made, inter alia, in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus, the 2005 World Summit outcome, the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development and in relevant forums. An enhanced predictable and sustainable flow of official development assistance is essential to meet the regular development challenges as well as the new and emerging challenges in developing countries, in particular in least developed countries. We recall the unfulfilled commitment made by developed countries at the meeting held in Gleneagles, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 122. We urge the developed countries to fulfill their commitment to provide 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance for developing countries as well as to achieve the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance to the least developed countries and to increase the target to 1 per cent of gross national income by 2030. We express our deep concern that official development assistance commitments remain unfulfilled. 123. The global financial and economic crisis cannot be an excuse to avoid fulfilling existing aid commitments by developed countries and to make further commitments. An effective response to the economic crisis requires timely implementation of existing aid commitments and an urgent and unavoidable need for donors to fulfill them. We therefore call upon developed countries collectively to fulfill their official development assistance commitments and to raise overall levels further, keeping in mind that the developing countries will require new, additional and sustainable financial resources to a significant extent and amount in order to implement a wide range of development activities. 124. We stress the need for ensuring new and additional financial support to developing countries as a key means of implementation for achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the forthcoming sustainable development goals. Financial assistance should be made available without conditionalities, since development strategies should be country-led and take into account the specific conditions, needs and priorities of developing countries. It should be based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, with North-South cooperation at its core and South-South and triangular cooperation as a useful complement. 125. We stress that official development assistance is a key source for financing the development of developing countries that should be used in accordance with their national developmental priorities without conditionalities, and express our deep concern about the attempt made by donor countries, outside United Nations forums, to redefine official development assistance by including other sources of financing that are not linked or related to the development of developing countries, with the objective of disguising the drop in official development assistance flows not based on their agreed commitments, which are still pending fulfillment. External debt 126. We are concerned that, with the global economic crisis, the economies of increasing numbers of developing countries are being affected and that some countries are becoming more vulnerable to new external debt problems or even crises. Addressing the external debt problems of developing countries is thus an important part of international cooperation and the enhanced global partnership for development. 127. We are of the view that debt crises tend to be costly and disruptive and are usually followed by large cuts in public spending and a decline in economic growth and employment. These crises affect developing countries more deeply and those that are heavily indebted are unable to return to the path of growth without international assistance. We recognize the importance of debt relief, including debt cancellation, debt restructuring, debt moratorium and debt audit procedures. Debt restructuring processes should have as their core element a determination of real payment capacity so that they may not adversely affect economic growth and the fulfillment of the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals, the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda. In this regard, we reiterate the urgent need for the international community to examine options for an effective, equitable, durable, independent and development-oriented international debt resolution mechanism, and call upon all countries to promote and contribute to the discussions within the United Nations and other appropriate forums with that objective. 128. We also recall that sovereign debt management has been a crucial issue for developing countries in past decades and recent years. Recently, a new concern has emerged relating to the activities of vulture funds. Recent examples of the actions of vulture funds in international courts have revealed their highly speculative nature. Such funds pose a risk to all future debt-restructuring processes, both for developing and developed countries. We therefore stress the importance of not allowing vulture funds to paralyze the debt-restructuring efforts of developing countries, and that these funds should not supersede a State's right to protect its people under international law. 129. We express serious concern about the substantial increase in the financial stability risks of many developed economies and, in particular, their high structural fragilities in financing sovereign debt created as a result of transferring private risk to the public sector. In this regard, we call for urgent and coherent solutions to reduce sovereign risk in developed economies in order to prevent contagion and to mitigate its impact on the international financial system and on developing countries. 130. We stress the need to ensure that the economic and monetary policies implemented by developed countries do not affect global aggregate demand and liquidity, owing to the objective of finding surplus in their balance of payments, with negative results in the reduction of global revenues in developing countries. Reforming the global financial architecture 131. We affirm the need for reform of the international financial architecture so that we have a financial and monetary system that reflects the realities of the twenty-first century, including a properly regulated international financial sector that reduces and discourages speculative investment, in order for capital markets to be mobilized to achieve sustainable development and play a constructive role in the global development agenda. 132. We also note the continuation of fundamental problems in the global financial and monetary system, including lack of regulation to ensure financial stability, the problems of the reserve currencies, the volatility in currency exchange rates, the speculative and large cross-border flows of capital and the insufficiency or unavailability of liquidity for developing countries in need of financial resources that face foreign exchange shortfalls or require resources to generate sustainable growth and development. We call for a program of reforms, with full voice, representation and participation of developing countries, to address these problems. 133. We note with concern that financial deregulation and financial liberalization have given rise to the massive expansion of speculative financial flows and derivatives trading. The financial and economic crisis of 2008 has illustrated that international finance has created an economy of its own, which has become increasingly disconnected from the real economy of production, direct investment, job creation and wage growth. The adverse effects of financialization include volatile capital flows, excessive commodity and food price fluctuations, rapid shifts in exchange rates and boom-bust cycles of financial crisis and economic recession. 134. We urge that the reform process of the governance structure of the Bretton Woods institutions be finalized as soon as possible and be much more ambitious, and that an accelerated plan be established for further reforms in representation, participation and parity of voting power for developing countries in the decision-making process within the Bretton Woods institutions and in all discussions on international monetary reform and in the operation of the new arrangements for special drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on the basis of criteria that truly reflect its mandate in the field of development and with the participation of all stakeholders in an equitable, transparent, consultative and inclusive process. In this regard, we call on the General Assembly to launch a process to reform the international financial and monetary system. 135. We support exploration of the establishment of a United Nations intergovernmental mechanism under the General Assembly, as an entity responsible for monitoring the performance of the global economic and financial system in a comprehensive and sustainable manner. It is important that this mechanism monitor the impact of certain international financial flows and policies that are systemically important to prevent the spread of economic and financial crisis among countries. Reforming the credit rating system 136. We stress that international efforts to reregulate the financial sector should include the credit rating agencies. Governments should limit their regulatory reliance on credit rating agencies and reform legal regimes to hold them liable for negligent behavior in order to suppress conflicts of interest and ensure integrity, accountability and transparency. 137. We also stress the need for a more transparent international credit rating system that takes fully into account the needs, concerns and peculiarities of developing countries, especially heavily indebted developing countries. In this regard, we express concern about the extent of soundness of the methodology used by the major credit rating agencies. We emphasize that greater transparency and competition among rating agencies is necessary to avoid oligopolistic tendencies and their negative effects. We reiterate that an inadequate assessment of the solvency of debtors has the potential to cause or exacerbate crises, rendering the financial system more vulnerable. It is necessary to continue the discussions at the United Nations and other venues on the role of credit rating agencies, with a view to proposing concrete policies aimed at reducing dependency on them by enhancing their supervision and increasing transparency and competition through the establishment of independent assessment mechanisms. Global economic governance 138. We affirm that the current world financial and economic crisis and its consequences for development have exposed the gaps and failures in global economic governance, including within the international financial institutions, and the urgent need for a global, universal and integrated response by the international community. We note with deep concern that seven years after the outbreak of the global crisis, there has been little progress made to strengthen the systemic, regulatory and structural aspects of the global financial system. Moreover, the lack of participation by developing countries in general in global economic issues and governance persists; this is a matter of grave concern because the workings of the global system affect all countries, and this democratic deficit has even more serious consequences for developing countries when the global economy is slowing down or in recession. 139. We strongly call on the international community to redress the democratic deficit in global economic governance and provide developing countries their rightful place and participation in the governance and decision-making of all the institutions and forums where discussions and decisions are taken on global economic and financial issues. 140. We affirm that efforts to reform the international financial architecture should therefore be seriously strengthened, should be internationally coordinated and should lead to the full participation of developing countries in international financial and economic decision-making and norm-setting. We call for comprehensive reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, including enhancement of the voting powers of developing countries in a time-bound manner, in order to enable greater equity between developed and developing countries and to eliminate all types of conditionalities tied to aid. 141. We call for the urgent completion of the 2010 IMF quota formula reform in order to ensure that the quotas and governance of IMF better reflect the relative weight of emerging and developing countries in the global economy. However, the redistribution of voting rights to reflect reality alone will not resolve the structural problems of financial instability and the lack of liquidity for developing countries in need to generate the necessary sustainable growth and development. Also the reform should encompass liquidity creation, including improvement in the special drawing rights for developing countries. IMF must provide more comprehensive and flexible financial responses to the needs of developing countries, without imposing procyclical conditionalities and respecting their need for adequate policy space. Furthermore, leading personnel of the Bretton Woods institutions must be designated on the basis of their individual merits, through an open and fair process of selection. As long as IMF does not reflect the new realities in the global economy and its Director General keeps being designated through a process that lacks any transparency, its legitimacy will remain questionable. 142. We stress the need to hold a follow-up international conference on financing for development in 2015 to review the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration with a view to contributing to the post-2015 development agenda process. 143. While respecting the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the intergovernmental nature of the Organization, we recognize the important role of the United Nations in providing an intergovernmental forum, including through international conferences and summits for universal dialogue and consensus on global challenges with the due participation of relevant stakeholders. 144. We reaffirm the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations, as well as the role of the Assembly in global matters of concern to the international community, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations. Strengthening and reorienting the United Nations 145. We reaffirm our commitment to increase the participation of developing countries in the decision-making bodies of multilateral institutions in order to render them more consistent with the current geopolitical reality. 146. We stress the importance of the central role of the United Nations in global economic governance, which aims at enhancing the global partnership for development with a view to creating a supportive and enabling global environment for the attainment of sustainable development and to ensuring financial and economic stability. In this context, the General Assembly and a strengthened Economic and Social Council could both act to mitigate the impact of the international financial and economic crisis and to ensure the right of developing countries to policy space for sustainable development. 147. We stress that strengthening of the United Nations and its role in international cooperation for development is essential to respond to current and future challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization. We recognize that the United Nations needs to improve its capabilities and capacities to fully implement its mandates and to ensure the effective delivery of its programs in the social and economic development fields. In this regard, we urge the Secretary-General to further strengthen the development pillar of the whole Organization, including its Development Account. 148. We urge developed countries to show real political will, so that in the process of reform of the United Nations, including the strengthening and revitalization of the General Assembly as an emblem of global sovereignty, it can improve its capabilities and capacities to fully implement its mandates and ensure the effective delivery of its program in the social, environmental and economic development fields. 149. We stress that strengthening of the United Nations and its role in international cooperation for development is essential to respond to current and future challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization. Within this context, we express our concern over the growing imbalance between assessed and voluntary contributions in the proposed program budgets of the Organization. We also stress that the level of resources to be approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations must be commensurate with all mandated programs and activities in order to ensure their full and effective implementation. 150. We reaffirm that any United Nations Secretariat and management reform efforts, including on the budget process, must not seek to change the intergovernmental, multilateral and international nature of the Organization, but must strengthen the ability of Member States to perform their oversight and monitoring role, and that prior consideration and approval by Member States is essential in all cases where the measures to be implemented fall under the prerogatives of the General Assembly, and in this regard we recall resolution 66/257. We also reiterate the need to increase the representation of developing countries and the representation of women from developing countries, in particular at the senior levels, and to improve geographic distribution in the Secretariat and transparency in the recruitment process. 151. We call for continued efforts to reform the United Nations, including the revitalization of the General Assembly and a comprehensive reform of the Security Council, which correspond to the collective interests of developing countries. 152. We express concern over budget cuts that have a negative impact on the implementation of mandates approved by the intergovernmental bodies of the United Nations, particularly in the development pillar, and the growing imbalance between assessed and voluntary contributions. 153. We call for greater transparency, accountability and oversight by Member States with respect to voluntary and extrabudgetary resources. It is important that resources from voluntary and extrabudgetary contributions be used to support all priorities agreed to by Member States and that they be used strictly in accordance with the intergovernmentally agreed financial regulations and rules of the Organization. 154. We underscore the central role of the United Nations in global economic governance, as a truly universal and inclusive multilateral forum with unquestioned legitimacy, convening power and normative frameworks. We emphasize the important role that the General Assembly should play in the appointment of the Secretary-General of the United Nations upon the recommendation of the Security Council in accordance with Article 97 of the Charter. In this regard, we stress that the process of selection of the Secretary-General should be inclusive of all Member States, as well as more transparent. Furthermore, we believe that regional rotation, as well as respect for equitable geographical representation, should be taken into account during selection and appointment processes. 155. We also recognize the importance of increasing the number of nationals from developing countries at the senior level in the Secretariat, in particular in the Senior Management Group. Technology transfer, science and innovation for development 156. We believe that science, knowledge and technology integration and innovation should be instruments for promoting peace and people's sustainable development, well-being and happiness and that they should thus be oriented towards the promotion of the empowerment of the poor, the eradication of poverty and hunger, and the promotion of solidarity and complementarity among and within peoples so that they may live well in harmony with Mother Earth. 157. We express our concern that science, technology and innovation can be abused as instruments to limit and undermine countries' sovereignty, sustainable development and poverty eradication. 158. We call for an end to the use of information and communication technologies, including social networks, in contravention of international law and in detriment to any State, in particular members of the Group of 77 or their citizens. 159. We reaffirm that technology plays a key role in addressing development challenges across a wide scope of issues, including in food and agriculture, water and sanitation, climate change, energy, industry, chemicals and waste management. Technology transfer, technology integration and the development and promotion of endogenous technologies are important for developing countries to engender economic growth in an environmentally sustainable manner. We call on developed countries to implement their commitments to transfer technology to developing countries and provide access to technology on favorable terms, including concessional and preferential terms, to enable the developing countries to shift to a more sustainable development path. 160. It is imperative that developed countries recommit themselves to the objective of technology transfer as one of the major components, along with finance, capacity-building and trade, of provision of the means of implementation towards sustainable development for developing countries, and to take actions to bridge the technological gap. We call for the early establishment by the United Nations system of a technology facilitation mechanism that promotes the development, transfer and dissemination of clean and environmentally sound technologies, including cleaner fossil fuel technologies. 161. We call for regulations and policies on intellectual property to be placed within a development framework, whereby intellectual property rights are oriented towards the promotion of balanced social, economic and environmental development. In this regard, we support the measures taken by developing countries to promote the implementation of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Development Agenda recommendations of 2007. We reiterate our call, made in paragraph 8 (vii) of the 2005 Doha Plan of Action adopted at the second South Summit of the Group of 77, for WIPO to continue to include in its future plans and activities, including legal advice, a development dimension that includes promoting development and access to knowledge for all, pro-development norm-setting, harmonization with the Convention on Biological Diversity rules, establishing development-friendly principles, and the transfer and dissemination of technology. 162. We also reiterate that the TRIPS Agreement of WTO contains flexibilities, and that it is the right of developing States members of WTO to make use of such flexibilities, as confirmed in the 2001 Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health of WTO, and we support the use of these flexibilities in our countries, with the aim of promoting health, education and economic and social development. We note with great interest and appreciation that some developing countries have successfully made use of some TRIPS flexibilities to promote the use of generic medicines, which are lower in cost and thus greatly increase access to medicines at affordable prices. We reject attempts by any developed country or business interest to pressure developing countries not to exercise their right to make use of TRIPS Agreement flexibilities for social and development purposes and express our solidarity with those developing countries that have come under such pressure. 163. We stress the need to protect the knowledge of developing countries, indigenous peoples and local communities with regard to genetic resources, biodiversity and traditional knowledge, and especially from continuing attempts by persons or companies to patent such resources and knowledge without the approval of the countries, indigenous peoples and communities concerned. 164. We call for intensified efforts by our negotiators and policymakers to establish legal mechanisms, internationally or nationally, to prevent biopiracy by requiring disclosure of the country of origin and proof of benefit-sharing arrangements by applicants for such patents. We also call for strong provisions and effective mechanisms for technology transfer, including appropriate treatment of intellectual property, in the international climate change regime in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Trade 165. We believe that trade in the context of appropriate policies and rules can be an important tool for economic development. Because of the continuing global financial and economic crisis, there has been a decline in trade growth, which has had a severe impact on many developing countries as the result of the fall in export revenues, trade barriers and trade-distorting subsidies in developed countries, and restricted access to trade finance and reduced investment in production diversification and in the promotion of exports and remains a matter of concern. It is essential to establish and uphold a universal, fair, rules-based, open, pro-development, non‑discriminatory, inclusive and equitable multilateral trading system that contributes to growth, sustainable development and employment, particularly for developing countries. 166. We call for a timely and successful conclusion to the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which must fully respect its development mandate and place the needs and priorities of developing countries at its centre. Following the WTO Ministerial Conference in Bali in 2013, we call for an inclusive and transparent negotiating process and the prioritizing of the interests and issues of developing countries in the post-Bali program. We view with concern that some developed countries members of WTO are more interested in gaining market access to developing countries, while they are themselves not willing to take adequate measures to eliminate or reduce protectionism in their agriculture sector or to provide more market access to developing countries. 167. We reiterate that developed countries should provide effective, sustainably financed trade-related technical assistance and capacity-building tailored to the specific needs and constraints of developing countries, including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework of WTO, in order to address the supply-side and trade-related infrastructure and productive capacity constraints of least developed countries. Likewise, it is crucial for developing countries to have access to financial and technical assistance for capacity-building in order to implement effectively the new WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. In this context, special focus must be given, among other elements, to those projects and programs oriented towards developing and strengthening corridors for reducing costs in international transit. 168. We emphasize the importance of facilitating accession to WTO. The accession process should be accelerated without political impediment and in an expeditious and transparent manner for developing countries, in full compliance with WTO rules. This would contribute to the rapid and full integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system. 169. We believe that trade rules, in WTO or in bilateral and regional trade agreements, should enable developing countries to have sufficient policy space so that they can make use of policy instruments and measures that are required for their economic and social development. We reiterate our call for the effective strengthening of the special and differential treatment and less than full reciprocity principles and provisions in WTO so as to broaden the policy space of developing countries and enable them to benefit more from the multilateral trading system. We also call for bilateral trade and investment agreements involving developed and developing countries to have sufficient special and differential treatment for developing countries to enable them to retain adequate policy space for social and economic development. Migration 170. We consider that the nexus between migration and development must be addressed comprehensively, mindful of the economic, social and environmental dimensions and include a cultural and human perspective. We recognize the need to address this issue through international, regional or bilateral cooperation and dialogue and through a comprehensive, balanced, coordinated and coherent approach, recognizing the role and responsibilities of countries of origin, transit and destination in promoting and protecting effectively the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants and their families, especially those of women and children, regardless of their migration status. 171. We note that despite progress in discussion and dialogue and cooperation at the international level, migration remains inadequately reflected in development frameworks, development agendas and sectoral policies at both the national and global levels. Therefore, we are exploring the possibility of a legally binding convention on migration and development to improve the governance of international migration and to protect and promote the human rights of migrants and their contribution to development, regardless of their migratory status. 172. We acknowledge the important role that migrants play as partners in the development of origin, transit and destination countries, and the need to enhance the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrant workers and their families. We also stress the need to continue to consider the recognition of the qualifications and competencies of migrants and their access to low-cost financial services for remittances. Climate change 173. We affirm that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change. In this regard, we stress that the international response to climate change must fully respect the principles, provisions and ultimate objective of the Convention, in particular the principles of equity and of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. 174. We reiterate that fulfilling the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will require strengthening the multilateral, rules-based regime under the Convention and therefore further reaffirm the importance of continuing the negotiations on climate change under the Convention in accordance with its principles and provisions and of adopting, in 2015, a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all parties. 175. We recall that climate change is one of the most serious global challenges of our times. We underscore the fact that developing countries continue to suffer the most from the adverse impacts of climate change, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and the impact of response measures, even though they are the least responsible for climate change. Accordingly, we call for developed countries to take the lead in responding to climate change. Climate change threatens not only the development prospects of developing countries and their achievement of sustainable development but also the very existence and survival of countries and societies. 176. We recognize that low-lying and other small island countries, developing countries with low-lying coastal, arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods, drought and desertification, and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. 177. We reaffirm the importance of implementing the Warsaw international mechanism for loss and damage associated with climate change impacts adopted at the nineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Warsaw from 11 to 23 November 2013 (decision 2/CP.19). We also recognize the urgency of taking concrete steps during this year, ahead of the twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties, to be held in Lima, for the immediate operationalization of the mechanism. 178. We stress that the developed countries, given their historical responsibility, need to take the lead in addressing this challenge in accordance with the principles and provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, particularly the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and equity, and provide financial and technological support to developing countries in a transparent, adequate and predictable manner under a modality of monitoring, reporting and verification. 179. We reiterate that the extent to which developing countries will effectively implement their commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will depend on the effective implementation by developed countries of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of developing countries. 180. We stress the need to urgently close the ambition gap, and express concern about the lack of fulfillment of commitments by developed countries. In addressing this gap, the focus must not be limited to mitigation only but also address gaps relating to finance, technology and support for capacity-building, balanced with a focus on adaptation to climate change. We emphasize that developed countries must take robust and ambitious mitigation commitments, with ambitious quantitative targets for limiting and reducing emissions, as required by science and mandated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 181. We reiterate the urgency of expediting the process of operationalizing the Green Climate Fund and for its early capitalization, and call upon developed countries to meet the goal of mobilizing $100 billion each year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. 182. We affirm our support for the success of the meeting to be held in Venezuela ahead of the twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties, to be held in Lima, and reaffirm the need to achieve progress in negotiations towards an ambitious, balanced, fair and effective agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in accordance with its principles and provisions, to be agreed in 2015 and to enter into force in 2020 and that actually contributes to the stabilization of the climate system. Biological diversity 183. We reaffirm the recognition contained in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development about the severity of global biodiversity loss and degradation of ecosystems, and emphasize that these undermine global development, affecting food security and nutrition, the provision of and access to water, and the health of the rural poor and of people worldwide, including present and future generations. This highlights the importance of the conservation of biodiversity, enhancing habitat connectivity and building ecosystem resilience. 184. We recognize the importance of the role of the collective actions of the indigenous people and local communities for the protection, use and conservation of biodiversity. We also reaffirm that the traditional knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous peoples and local communities make an important contribution to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and that their wider application can support social well-being and sustainable livelihoods. We further recognize that indigenous peoples and local communities are often most directly dependent on biodiversity and ecosystems and thus are often most immediately affected by their loss and degradation. 185. We welcome the important outcomes of the eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, held in Hyderabad, India, in October 2012, especially the commitment to doubling biodiversity-related international financial flows to developing countries by 2015 and at least maintaining this level until 2020 to contribute to the achievement of the Convention's three objectives. We also call upon the parties to the Convention to review progress made in this context at the twelfth meeting of the Conference of the Parties towards adopting a final target for resource mobilization. 186. We welcome the realization of the joint briefing held on 30 October 2013 by the United Nations Environment Program, WIPO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNDP, UNCTAD, the secretariat of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and the secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity on the implementation of the objectives of the Convention, including actions taken to promote access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization and associated traditional knowledge. We note that similar interactions should be encouraged, recognizing the respective mandates of the organizations involved, and call upon all Member States, in particular developed countries, to speed up the process for the ratification of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from Their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity. 187. We note with deep concern the unprecedented increase in poaching and illegal trade in wildlife and their products in all regions, in particular of elephant tusks and rhinoceros horns. We stress that this trend is detrimental to ecological balance, promotes crime within and across borders and must be halted with a sense of urgency to avoid reversing decades of conservation gains. We therefore strongly condemn poaching and crimes related to illicit trafficking in wildlife, and agree to enhance international cooperation in accordance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and other relevant agreements to curb such practices, address the demand and supply of wildlife and its products and increase the capacity of communities affected by such trafficking to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities. Forests 188. We highlight the social, economic and environmental benefits of forests to people and the contributions of sustainable forest management to the objective of sustainable development. We support cross-sectoral and cross-institutional policies promoting sustainable forest management (United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development), and recognize the importance of the holistic, integral and alternative approaches for the sustainable management of forests developed under the climate change negotiations. 189. We note the outcome of the tenth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests, held in Istanbul, Turkey, from 8 to 19 April 2013, and underscore the importance of the four global objectives on forests for the international community as a whole and in particular for developing countries. The fourth global objective is especially relevant for developing countries since it identifies the need to reverse the reduction in official development assistance and to mobilize new and additional financial resources for the implementation of sustainable forest management. In fulfilling the fourth global objective, it is essential to respect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities between developed and developing countries. In this regard, we urge developed countries to exercise strong political will and flexibility to contribute to the achievement of sustainable forest management. 190. We call for the establishment of a new global forest fund in line with the principles of sustainable development. We consider that this is necessary in order to channel the funds needed by developing countries to sustainably manage their forests. Desertification, land degradation and drought 191. We reaffirm that desertification, land degradation and drought represent serious concerns for developing countries. International action is, therefore, urgently required to address these challenges. We emphasize the great importance of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, particularly in Africa, stressing that desertification, land degradation and drought undermine the three dimensions of sustainable development. We reiterate that addressing desertification, land degradation and drought enables countries to deal with several global policy challenges, such as food security, adaptation to climate change and forced migration. In this context, we note the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, held from 16 to 27 September 2013 in Windhoek. 192. We reiterate the need for cooperation through the sharing of climate and weather information and forecasting and early warning systems related to desertification, land degradation and drought, as well as to dust storms and sandstorms, at the global, regional and subregional levels. In this regard, we invite States and relevant organizations to cooperate in the sharing of related information and forecasting and early warning systems. Oceans and seas 193. We stress the importance of the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and seas and of their resources for sustainable development, including through their contributions to poverty eradication, sustained economic growth, food security and the creation of sustainable livelihoods and decent work, while at the same time protecting biodiversity and the marine environment and addressing the impacts of climate change. We therefore commit to protect and restore the health, productivity and resilience of oceans and marine ecosystems, to maintain their biodiversity, enabling their conservation and sustainable use for present and future generations, and to deliver on all three dimensions of sustainable development. Internet governance, including the right to privacy 194. We view with dismay that some countries have recently been undertaking extensive, arbitrary and unlawful surveillance and/or interception of communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of communications as well as the collection of personal data, including on a mass scale, on people and institutions in other countries, including on political leaders, senior officials and various government departments and agencies, as well as citizens. We call for the ending of such activities, which violate the human right to privacy of individuals and have a negative impact on the relations between countries. In this regard, we all call for intergovernmental entities to discuss and review the use of information and communications technologies to ensure that they fully comply with international law, including human rights law, in accordance with the purpose and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. 195. We welcome the NETmundial Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance held in São Paulo, Brazil, on 23 and 24 April 2014, and take note of its outcome document. 196. We emphasize the important opportunities provided by information and communications technologies, including social media and related infrastructure, as a vehicle to promote better understanding among nations and the achievement of internationally agreed upon development objectives. 197. We recognize at the same time that the illegal use of information and communications technologies has a negative impact on nations and their citizens. In this regard, we express our strong rejection of the use of information and communications technologies in violation of international law, including the right to privacy, and of any action of this nature directed against any Member State, in particular a State member of the Group of 77. 198. We further underscore the importance of ensuring that the use of such technologies should be fully compatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, in particular the principles of sovereignty, the non-interference in internal matters and the internationally recognized rules of civil coexistence among States. 199. In this regard, we take note with concern of the information published in international media about the objectives of the so-called "ZunZuneo" network, which would constitute an illicit use of new information and communications technologies. 200. We therefore reiterate our commitment to intensifying international efforts directed at safeguarding cyberspace and promoting its exclusive use for the achievement of peaceful purposes and as a vehicle to contribute to both economic and social development, and highlight that international cooperation, in full respect of human rights, is the only viable option for fostering the positive effects of information and communications technologies, preventing their potential negative effects, promoting their peaceful and legitimate use and guaranteeing that both scientific and technological progress is directed at preserving peace and promoting the welfare and development of our societies. Millennium Development Goals 201. We express our commitment to strengthening efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and to taking a leading role in shaping the international development agenda during the post-2015 period. We call upon the international community to redouble all efforts for the accelerated achievement of the Goals by 2015 through concrete measures. 202. We note the progress achieved so far in reaching the Millennium Development Goals but are concerned about the unevenness and gaps in achievement and about the vast socioeconomic and environmental challenges that remain in developing countries. We reiterate that the Goals remain critical for meeting the basic needs of people in developing countries, many of which are not on track to achieving them by 2015. 203. We underscore the central role of the global partnership for development and the importance of Millennium Development Goal No. 8 in achieving all the Goals and that without substantial international support and systemic changes, several of the Goals will not be achieved in many developing countries by 2015. We call upon the international community to intensify its efforts to provide enhanced means of implementation to developing countries through a renewed global partnership based on the collective quest to eradicate poverty and deprivation. Sustainable development and sustainable development goals 204. We recall and reaffirm the statement made by world leaders in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, "The future we want", that poverty eradication is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. 205. We reiterate that eradicating poverty, changing unsustainable patterns of consumption and production, promoting sustainable patterns of consumption and production, and protecting and managing the natural resource base for economic and social development are the overarching objectives of and essential requirements for sustainable development. We also reaffirm the need to achieve sustainable development by promoting sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, and promoting integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems that supports, inter alia, economic, social and human development while facilitating ecosystem conservation, regeneration and restoration and resilience in the face of new and emerging challenges. 206. We stress that sustainable development goals should address and be focused on the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social and environmental) and be guided by the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, respecting all the Rio Principles and taking into account different national circumstances, capacities and priorities. 207. We reaffirm that the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development is the basis for the work of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals. We underscore the importance for the sustainable development goals to build upon and complement the Millennium Development Goals in making progress towards the overarching objective of achieving poverty eradication. 208. We stress that progress in realizing the Millennium Development Goals, the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda will depend on progress in creating a pro-development, international, enabling environment and delivering the relevant means of implementation, particularly in the areas of finance, trade, technology and capacity-building, to developing countries. 209. We reaffirm that the guiding principles of the sustainable development goals must be based on all principles set out at the major United Nations summits and conferences in the social, environmental and economic fields, bearing in mind those set out in, among others, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Agenda 21 and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, and those arising from the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (2012), the International Conference on Financing for Development (2002) and the World Summit for Social Development (1995), and be consistent with international law. The process and outcome of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals should fully respect all the Rio Principles, in particular the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The sustainable development goals should contribute to the full implementation of the outcomes of all the major summits in the economic, social and environmental fields. 210. We reaffirm the recognition that planet Earth and its ecosystems are our home and that "Mother Earth" is a common expression in a number of countries and regions, and note that some countries recognize the rights of nature in the context of the promotion of sustainable development. We are convinced that in order to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environment needs of present and future generations, it is necessary to promote harmony with nature. We call for a holistic, integrated approach to sustainable development, which may include, among others, the recognition by some countries of the principles mentioned above, to guide humanity to live in harmony with nature and lead to efforts to restore the health and integrity of the Earth's ecosystems. 211. We welcome the interactive dialogue of the General Assembly on Harmony with Nature, held on 22 April 2013, to commemorate International Mother Earth Day. At the event, different economic approaches were discussed in the context of sustainable development, to promote a more ethical basis for the relationship between humanity and Earth, as was the need to promote the sustainable use of natural resources, bearing in mind the importance of exploring the adoption and implementation of policies to build national developmental strategies that promote a better distribution of benefits, going beyond the mere production of raw commodities, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 67/214. 212. We stress that the report of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals must be the result of an inclusive intergovernmental process. Thus, we reaffirm our commitment to actively engaging in such negotiations. 213. We underscore the need to define adequate means of implementation for each and every sustainable development goal, as well as the need for a dedicated sustainable development goal on the strengthened global partnership for sustainable development containing broader commitments on the means of implementation and international cooperation for sustainable development. Post-2015 development agenda 214. We reaffirm the centrality of a just, transparent and inclusive intergovernmental negotiation process in the establishment of the post-2015 development agenda, as decided at the special event towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, held in 2013. We stress that this intergovernmental negotiation process will need to focus on its modalities and substantive aspects to arrive at a negotiated and agreed outcome document, taking fully into account the outcomes of the various follow-up processes mandated at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, as well as of the major summits and conferences related to the social, economic and environmental fields. 215. Recalling the statement made at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development that poverty eradication is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, we emphasize that poverty eradication must remain the central and overarching objective of the post-2015 development agenda. We strongly support the view that the post-2015 development agenda should reinforce the commitment of the international community to eradicate poverty by 2030. 216. We underline the need for a coherent approach to the post-2015 development agenda, which should reinforce the commitment of the international community to poverty eradication and the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development in a balanced manner with the contributions of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals, the financing for development process, the Intergovernmental Committee on Experts for Sustainable Development Financing, the process to develop options for a United Nations technology facilitation mechanism and other relevant processes. 217. We reaffirm that the post-2015 development agenda must fully adhere to the Rio Principles, in particular the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. 218. We underscore the importance of strengthening the global partnership for development, to be based on quantified and time-bound targets, consistent with Millennium Development Goal No. 8 and in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in the post-2015 development agenda. North-South cooperation remains the core of this partnership and South-South and triangular cooperation are a useful complement to North-South cooperation. Strengthened commitment from developed countries is therefore required to enhance international cooperation and scale up support for developing countries. We emphasize the need for developed countries to urgently fulfill the official development assistance commitments they have made, individually and collectively, including the target of allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance by 2015 and the target of allocating between 0.15 and 0.20 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance for least developed countries. 219. We emphasize that the post-2015 development agenda must meaningfully address issues of reform of the institutions of global economic governance in order to strengthen the voice and participation of developing countries in decision-making in these institutions. We also note that the global economic, financial and trading systems remain imbalanced, to the disadvantage of developing countries, and in this regard we stress the importance of identifying, in the post-2015 development agenda, the weaknesses and imbalances of these global systems and of proposing actions for improvements with the aim of supporting the development agenda and the programs of developing countries. 220. We affirm the need for a sound implementation mechanism for the post-2015 agenda to ensure development resources for the attainment of goals. In this regard, we call for the intensification of development financing, for the establishment and improvement of mechanisms of technology transfer and for the enhancement of efforts to build the capacities of developing countries. 221. We call for a responsible accountability approach to be adopted on the question of partnerships involving the United Nations, particularly as regards participation of the private sector, civil society and philanthropic entities. In this regard, we reaffirm the need to enhance transparency, coherence and sustainability, as well as accountability to Member States, in United Nations partnerships, and stress the need to ensure that procedures exist for the consideration and approval of any such initiatives by Member States in the General Assembly, in order to preserve the intergovernmental nature of the United Nations. 222. We emphasize that the post-2015 development agenda should be an agenda for development, and in this context it is important to advance economic, social and environmental development in a comprehensive, balanced and coordinated manner. This agenda should be broader than that of the Millennium Development Goals and aim to include areas, issues and groups of populations that are key to achieving sustainable development. 223. We also stress the importance for the post-2015 development agenda, if it is to be global in nature and universally applicable to all, to fully respect the development policy space of developing countries to make use of policy tools and measures that are required to implement their policies for poverty eradication and other developmental plans and programs. We also stress that the post-2015 development agenda should promote rapid, sustained and inclusive economic growth in developing countries as a key requirement for eradicating poverty and hunger and reducing inequalities within and among countries.
Part V
Particular needs of developing countries in special situations 224. We recall the special needs of Africa, the only continent currently not on track to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. We recognize that, while economic growth is returning, there is a need to sustain the recovery, which is fragile and uneven, to face the ongoing adverse impacts of multiple crises on development and the serious challenges these impacts pose to the fight against poverty and hunger, which could further undermine the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Goals in Africa. 225. We express profound concern about the fact that the commitment to doubling aid to Africa by 2010, as articulated at the summit of the Group of Eight held in Gleneagles, United Kingdom, was not entirely reached, and in this regard we stress the need to make rapid progress in order to fulfill that and other donors' commitments to increase aid through a variety of means, including the provision of new additional resources, the transfer of technology and the building of capacity of African countries, and to support their sustainable development. We call for continued support for Africa's development initiatives, including Agenda 2063 (a continental strategic vision and priority framework for socioeconomic development), the New Partnership for Africa's Development and the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa. On the other hand, we welcome the support that some developing countries have extended to Africa through South-South and triangular cooperation programs. 226. We express concern for the situation in the least developed countries, which continues to deteriorate as a consequence of ongoing multiple and mutually exacerbating global crises. The global financial and economic crisis currently under way is clearly undermining development in the least developed countries. The modest development gains that these countries have made over the years are being reversed, pushing a larger number of their people into extreme poverty. Many least developed countries continue to lag in meeting most of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. We emphasize the need for the full and effective implementation of the commitments made in the Program of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020. We further underline the critical need to realize expeditiously a renewed and strengthened global partnership for the least developed countries in order to overcome their structural challenges, eradicate poverty, achieve internationally agreed development goals and enable half the number of least developed countries to meet the criteria for graduation from the category by 2020. 227. We recall that the unique and particular vulnerabilities of small island developing States have been acknowledged by the international community at various United Nations meetings, including those held in Rio de Janeiro (1992), Barbados (1994), Johannesburg (2002) and Mauritius (2005), and note with concern that insufficient steps have been taken at the international level to address the vulnerabilities and effectively support the sustainable development efforts of such States. We recall that climate change and sea level rise pose the greatest threat to the survival and viability of small island developing States and to their efforts to achieve sustainable development goals, and call on the international community to commit itself to urgently increasing international cooperation to support those efforts, particularly through increased financial resources, capacity-building, transfer of technology and know-how, and increased participation of small island developing States in international economic decision-making. We welcome the decision to convene the third International Conference for Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, to be held in 2014, in Apia, and call for enhanced efforts to assist small island developing States in implementing the Program of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Program of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. We commit to work towards a strong outcome for the Apia conference that supports small island developing States in their sustainable development needs and aspirations. 228. We recognize the special needs of and challenges faced by landlocked developing countries caused by these States' lack of territorial access to the sea, which is aggravated by their remoteness from world markets, and also express concern about the fact that the economic growth and social well-being of landlocked developing countries remain very vulnerable to external shocks and to the multiple challenges the international community faces, including the financial and economic crisis and climate change. We stress the need for the international community to enhance development assistance to landlocked developing countries to help them overcome their vulnerabilities, build resilience and set themselves on a path of sustainable social and economic development. We reaffirm the need to urgently address the special development needs of and challenges faced by landlocked and transit developing countries through their genuine partnership with sufficient support and cooperation from the international community for the effective implementation of priorities of the Almaty Program of Action and its successor program. We welcome the decision of the General Assembly to hold a comprehensive ten-year review conference of the Almaty Program of Action in 2014, and call upon the international community to critically consider the special needs of and the challenges faced by landlocked developing countries, and to help develop priorities for a new, more comprehensive, common action-oriented framework of landlocked developing countries for the next decade. 229. We recognize that middle-income countries still face significant development challenges, and underline that, despite the recent progress achieved and the efforts made by middle-income countries, 75 per cent of the world's poor population lives in those countries. The achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the achievement of full employment and the creation of jobs for youth, the diversification of their economies, and the development of technologies continue to be huge challenges for middle-income countries. We underline the increasing solidarity and role played by middle-income countries in the area of South-South cooperation in support of the development efforts of other developing countries. We also note the outcomes of the High-Level Conference of Middle-Income Countries organized by Costa Rica and UNIDO in June 2013. 230. We stress the need for the United Nations development system to ensure that it addresses the diverse and specific development needs of middle-income countries in a coordinated manner through, inter alia, an accurate assessment of the national priorities and needs of these countries, taking into account the use of variables that go beyond per capita income criteria and recognizing the multidimensional nature of development and poverty, and through adequate, systemic and better-focused support in accordance with national plans. 231. We reiterate our call for the immediate and full withdrawal of Israel, the occupying Power, from the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the occupied Syrian Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 and from the remaining Lebanese occupied land. We reaffirm our support for a Middle East peace process aimed at achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions, including Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 425 (1978) and 1850 (2008), and the principle of land for peace. In this context, we also reaffirm our support for the Arab Peace Initiative adopted by the Council of the League of Arab States in March 2002. 232. We stress the need for the early realization by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination and to the independence of their State of Palestine to allow for their stability, prosperity and development towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, to which all peoples are entitled. We express support for the efforts of the Palestinian people to achieve independence and welcome in this regard the submission by the State of Palestine of its application, on 23 September 2011, for full membership in the United Nations, and notes the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 67/19 of 29 November 2012, by which it accorded to Palestine non-member observer State status in the United Nations. We continue to support the admission process of the State of Palestine to become a full member of the United Nations as soon as possible. We recall that 2014 was declared the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian people. 233. We condemn the ongoing Israeli military occupation of the Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the illegal actions by the occupying Power that continue to cause civilian casualties, socioeconomic and humanitarian hardship and destruction to Palestinian properties, infrastructure and agricultural lands, and to undermine the contiguity, unity and integrity of the Territory. 234. We express deep concern about the further decline of the social and economic conditions of the Palestinian people, particularly in the besieged Gaza Strip, as a result of the illegal Israeli practices, including construction of settlements and the Wall and the imposition of a blockade and hundreds of checkpoints. We call upon Israel, the occupying Power, to cease immediately all illegal measures impairing the Palestinian economy and development, including, in particular, the inhumane and illegal blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip and restrictions on the movement of persons and goods, including commercial trade throughout, into and out of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and to make reparation for all damages caused to Palestinian properties, institutions and infrastructure. We reiterate our call upon the international community to continue providing much needed developmental and humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people during this critical period, particularly for reconstruction and economic recovery in the Gaza Strip. 235. We reaffirm the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and of the population of the occupied Syrian Golan over their natural resources, including land, water and energy resources, and demand that Israel, the occupying Power, cease the exploitation, damage, cause of loss or depletion and endangerment of the natural resources in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan. 236. We reaffirm the need for the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to resume negotiations in accordance with the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, in order to find, as soon as possible, a peaceful solution to the sovereignty dispute relating to the question of the Malvinas Islands, which seriously damages the economic capacities of Argentina, and the need for both parties to refrain from taking decisions that would imply introducing unilateral modifications in the situation while the islands are going through the process recommended by the General Assembly. 237. We reaffirm the need to find a peaceful solution to the sovereignty issues facing developing countries, including the dispute over the Chagos archipelago, including Diego Garcia, which was unlawfully excised by the United Kingdom from the territory of Mauritius, prior to independence, in violation of international law and General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 2066 (XX) of 16 December 1965. Failure to resolve these decolonization and sovereignty issues would seriously damage and undermine the development and economic capacities and prospects of developing countries. In this regard, we note with great concern that despite the strong opposition of Mauritius, the United Kingdom purported to establish a "marine protected area" around the Chagos archipelago, which contravenes international law and further impedes the exercise by Mauritius of its sovereign rights over the archipelago and the right of return of Mauritius citizens who were forcibly removed from the archipelago by the United Kingdom. 238. We take note of the Havana Declaration adopted at the Second Summit of the Community of the Latin American and Caribbean States, held on 28 and 29 January 2014. 239. We reaffirm our firm rejection of the imposition of laws and regulations with extraterritorial impact and all other forms of coercive economic measures, including unilateral sanctions, against developing countries, and reiterate the urgent need to eliminate them immediately. We emphasize that such actions not only undermine the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and international law, but also severely threaten the freedom of trade and investment. We therefore call on the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries. 240. We express our rejection of unilateral lists and certifications by some developed countries affecting developing countries, in particular those referring to terrorism, drug trafficking, trafficking in persons and others of a similar nature. 241. We reiterate our call, made at the second South Summit, organized by the Group of 77 and China and held in Doha in 2005, for the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba, which, in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law, as well as to the principle of neighborliness, causes huge material losses and economic damage to the people of Cuba. We urge strict compliance to the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly on this matter. We also take note that in the Havana Declaration, the Heads of State and Government of the Community of the Latin American and Caribbean States reaffirmed their strongest rejection of the implementation of unilateral coercive measures and once again reiterated their solidarity with Cuba, while reaffirming their call upon the Government of the United States to put an end to the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on that sisterly nation for more than five decades. They rejected the inclusion of Cuba in the list of States sponsors of terrorism published by the State Department of the United States, and requested that an end be put to that unilateral practice. 242. We reaffirm our rejection to the unilateral economic sanctions imposed on the Sudan, which have a negative impact on the development and prosperity of the people of the Sudan, and in this regard call for an immediate lifting of those sanctions.
Por un Nuevo Orden Mundial para Vivir Bien Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia
14 y 15 de junio de 2014
Declaración de Santa Cruz
Parte I Contexto general 1. Nosotros, Jefas y Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno de los Estados miembros del Grupo de los 77 y China, nos hemos reunido en la ciudad de Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, para conmemorar el cincuentenario de la creación del Grupo. 2. Conmemoramos la formación del Grupo de los 77 el 15 de junio de 1964 y recordamos los ideales y principios contenidos en la histórica Declaración Conjunta de los Setenta y Siete Países en Desarrollo, firmada al final del primer período de sesiones de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre Comercio y Desarrollo (UNCTAD), celebrada en Ginebra. 3. Recordamos que, en su primera declaración, el Grupo de los 77 se comprometió a promover la igualdad en el orden económico y social internacional y a promover los intereses del mundo en desarrollo, declaró su unidad en el marco de un interés común y definió al Grupo como instrumento para ampliar el ámbito de la cooperación en la esfera internacional y para asegurar relaciones mutuamente benéficas con el resto del mundo. 4. Recordamos también la primera Reunión Ministerial del Grupo de los 77 celebrada en Argel del 10 al 25 de octubre de 1964, en la que el Grupo aprobó la Carta de Argel, que estableció los principios de unidad, complementariedad, cooperación y solidaridad de los países en desarrollo y su determinación de esforzarse por lograr el desarrollo económico y social, individual o colectivamente. 5. Ponemos de relieve que el Grupo de los 77 ha proporcionado los medios para que los países del Sur articulen y promuevan sus intereses económicos y sociales, ha mejorado su capacidad de negociación en el sistema de las Naciones Unidas, y observamos con satisfacción que el Grupo ha establecido una secretaría permanente en la Sede de las Naciones Unidas en Nueva York y capítulos en Ginebra, Nairobi, París, Roma, Viena y el Grupo de los 24 en Washington D.C., y que lo integran actualmente 133 Estados miembros. 6. Recordamos también el éxito de la primera Cumbre del Sur del Grupo de los 77 y China, celebrada en La Habana en abril de 2000, y de la segunda Cumbre del Sur, celebrada en Doha en junio de 2005, que elevaron la condición del Grupo de los 77 y China a nivel de Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno, y en las que se adoptaron importantes declaraciones y planes de acción que han guiado nuestro Grupo y constituyen la base fundamental para la construcción de un nuevo orden mundial y una agenda propia de los países del Sur para la creación de un sistema más justo, democrático y equitativo que beneficie a nuestros pueblos. 7. Nos comprometemos a continuar la tradición de nuestros países de consolidar el desarrollo nacional y unirnos en el plano internacional, en aras del establecimiento de un orden internacional justo en la economía mundial que ayude a los países en desarrollo a alcanzar nuestros objetivos de crecimiento económico sostenido, pleno empleo, equidad social, suministro de bienes y servicios básicos a nuestro pueblo, protección del medio ambiente y vida en armonía con la naturaleza. 8. Nos enorgullecen el legado y los grandes logros del Grupo de los 77 y China en la defensa y la promoción de los intereses de los países en desarrollo en los últimos 50 años, que han contribuido poco a poco a incrementar su peso e influencia en las cuestiones económicas, sociales y ambientales. Nos comprometemos a consolidar esa base y seguir construyendo un orden mundial que sea justo, equitativo, estable y pacífico. Entre otros hitos importantes en ese sentido cabe mencionar la aprobación por la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas de la Declaración sobre el Establecimiento del Nuevo Orden Económico Internacional de 1974, la Declaración sobre el Derecho al Desarrollo en 1986, y varias otras declaraciones históricas que reconocen las necesidades y los intereses de los países en desarrollo y responden a ellos, y constituyen una de sus prioridades máximas. 9. Creemos en el arreglo pacífico de las controversias mediante el diálogo. 10. También observamos que, a pesar de cinco decenios de logros, aún existen graves deficiencias en el cumplimiento de los objetivos de nuestro grupo, y que nuestros países, individual y colectivamente, se enfrentan a desafíos emergentes y que continúan, como la desaceleración de la economía mundial y sus efectos en nuestros países, y la falta de medidas sistémicas y mecanismos de rendición de cuentas adecuados para abordar las causas y los efectos de las crisis financiera y económica mundial, que plantea el consiguiente riesgo de que se mantenga el patrón de los ciclos de crisis. 11. También tomamos nota de las limitaciones existentes en muchos de nuestros países a la hora de satisfacer las necesidades de empleo, alimentos, agua, atención de la salud, educación, vivienda, infraestructura física y energía de nuestro pueblo, así como la inminente crisis del medio ambiente, que acarrea los efectos negativos del cambio climático en los países en desarrollo, la escasez cada vez mayor de agua potable y la pérdida de diversidad biológica. 12. Destacamos que los desequilibrios de la economía mundial y la desigualdad de las estructuras y los resultados de los sistemas comercial, financiero, monetario y tecnológico dieron lugar a la creación de nuestro Grupo. No obstante, esos desequilibrios persisten hoy en algunos aspectos incluso con más efectos adversos en los países en desarrollo. Por lo tanto, nos comprometemos a continuar e intensificar nuestros esfuerzos para tratar de establecer un orden internacional imparcial, justo y equitativo, orientado a satisfacer las necesidades de desarrollo de los países en desarrollo. 13. Ponemos de relieve que las razones para el establecimiento de nuestro Grupo hace 50 años siguen siendo reales y válidas, incluso más válidas que en ese momento. Por lo tanto, volvemos a comprometernos y a comprometer a nuestros países a fortalecer y ampliar los esfuerzos incansables del Grupo de los 77 y China en todos los ámbitos en pro de un mayor progreso y del mejoramiento de las condiciones de vida de nuestro pueblo. 14. Afirmamos que el siglo XXI es el momento para que los Países y los Pueblos del Sur desarrollen sus economías y sociedades a fin de cumplir las necesidades humanas de manera sostenible, en armonía con la naturaleza y respetando a la Madre Tierra y sus ecosistemas. Convenimos en consolidar nuestros valores tradicionales y las prácticas de solidaridad y colaboración en beneficio mutuo y la fortaleza de nuestro pueblo, a fin de lograr progresos en nuestros países y en la cooperación Sur-Sur. 15. Hacemos hincapié en que nuestras principales prioridades son promover un crecimiento económico sostenido, inclusivo y equitativo, crear mayores oportunidades para todos, reducir las desigualdades, mejorar los niveles de vida básicos; fomentar el desarrollo social equitativo y la inclusión; y promover una ordenación integrada y sostenible de los recursos naturales y los ecosistemas que preste apoyo, entre otras cosas, al desarrollo económico, social y humano, facilitando al mismo tiempo la conservación, la regeneración, el restablecimiento y la resiliencia del ecosistema frente a los desafíos nuevos y emergentes. 16. Reafirmamos que los puntos más fuertes del Grupo de los 77 han sido su unidad y solidaridad, su visión de las relaciones multilaterales justas y equitativas, el compromiso de sus Estados miembros con el bienestar de los pueblos del Sur y su empeño en promover una cooperación mutuamente beneficiosa. 17. Hacemos hincapié en que cada país tiene el derecho soberano de decidir sus propias prioridades y estrategias de desarrollo, teniendo presente que no hay una fórmula que sirva para todos. Ponemos de relieve la necesidad de que las normas internacionales permitan que los países en desarrollo dispongan de espacio y flexibilidad en cuanto a las políticas, ya que dichas normas están directamente relacionadas con las estrategias de desarrollo de los gobiernos nacionales. Ponemos de relieve también la necesidad de que haya espacio político para que nuestros países puedan formular estrategias de desarrollo que expresen intereses nacionales y distintas necesidades que no siempre se tienen presentes al formular políticas económicas internacionales en el proceso de integración con la economía mundial. 18. Nos preocupa la situación actual de la economía mundial y el estado de la gobernanza económica mundial y la necesidad de una enérgica recuperación. Creemos que el mundo se enfrenta a la peor crisis financiera y económica desde la Gran Depresión, y nos alarman los efectos adversos que está teniendo esta crisis sobre todo en los países en desarrollo. Creemos que la crisis ha puesto de relieve puntos débiles y desequilibrios sistémicos de larga data de la economía mundial, y ha puesto más de manifiesto la insuficiencia y el carácter antidemocrático de la gobernanza económica mundial. Deben hacerse ahora nuevos intentos para establecer un sistema adecuado de gobernanza económica mundial, con la plena expresión, representación y participación de los países en desarrollo en los debates y la adopción de decisiones. 19. Reconocemos la gran importancia de mantener la protección social y fomentar la creación de empleo, incluso en tiempos de crisis económica, y tomamos nota con satisfacción de los ejemplos alentadores de políticas que han permitido a los países reducir la pobreza, aumentar la inclusión social y crear nuevos y mejores empleos en los últimos años. 20. Nos preocupa el aumento de la concentración de la riqueza y los ingresos en el mundo y su distribución asimétrica, que han creado grandes desigualdades entre los países desarrollados y los países en desarrollo. Este grado de desigualdad es injustificable y no puede tolerarse en un mundo donde la pobreza sigue prevaleciendo, los recursos se están agotando y la degradación del medio ambiente es cada vez mayor. Pedimos que se adopten medidas a escala mundial para reducir las desigualdades a todos los niveles. También nos comprometemos a hacer frente a la desigualdad en nuestros propios países. 21. Tomamos nota con preocupación de la influencia de las grandes empresas, principalmente de los países desarrollados, en la economía mundial, y sus efectos negativos en el desarrollo social, económico y ambiental de algunos países en desarrollo, en particular en lo que respecta a los obstáculos que esa influencia pueda plantear al ingreso de nuevas empresas en el mercado mundial. En ese sentido, pedimos que la comunidad internacional adopte medidas concretas para hacer frente a esos efectos negativos y promover la competencia internacional y un mayor acceso a los mercados para los países en desarrollo, en particular políticas que promuevan el crecimiento de las pequeñas y medianas empresas en los países en desarrollo, la eliminación de las barreras comerciales que impiden la adición de valor en los países de origen, como las crestas arancelarias y la progresividad arancelaria, así como el fomento de la capacidad en materia de derecho de la competencia, la regulación de la política tributaria y la responsabilidad social de las empresas. 22. Ponemos de relieve que las empresas transnacionales tienen la responsabilidad de respetar todos los derechos humanos y deberían abstenerse de causar desastres medioambientales y afectar al bienestar de los pueblos. 23. Reconocemos los progresos logrados en el desarrollo sostenible a nivel regional, nacional, subnacional y local, y reafirmamos la importancia de apoyar a los países en desarrollo en sus esfuerzos por erradicar la pobreza mediante el empoderamiento de los pobres y las personas en situación vulnerable, promoviendo el desarrollo de la agricultura sostenible, así como el empleo pleno y productivo y el trabajo decente para todos, complementados por políticas sociales eficaces, incluidos niveles mínimos de protección social. 24. Respetamos plenamente los principios y propósitos de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y del derecho internacional, sobre todo en cuanto se refiere a la igualdad entre los Estados, el respeto de la independencia de los Estados, la soberanía nacional, la integridad territorial y la no injerencia en los asuntos internos de los Estados, y destacamos que dichos propósitos y principios inspiran nuestra plena adhesión al multilateralismo y dedicación a la búsqueda de un sistema económico internacional más justo y equitativo, que ofrezca oportunidades para elevar el nivel de vida de nuestros pueblos. 25. Somos profundamente conscientes de que decenios después de haber alcanzado la independencia política, algunos países en desarrollo siguen en las garras de la dependencia económica de las estructuras y los caprichos de la economía mundial y de los países desarrollados y sus entidades económicas. Esa dependencia, especialmente por parte de los países pobres y vulnerables, limita el alcance de nuestra verdadera independencia política también. Por lo tanto, nos comprometemos a aunar los esfuerzos encaminados a seguir tratando de alcanzar la independencia económica, y a reunirnos bajo la égida del Grupo de los 77 y China, así como de otras organizaciones del Sur, a fin de lograr avances a ese respecto. 26. Recordamos las decisiones adoptadas en la segunda Cumbre del Sur, celebrada en Doha en 2005, de cerciorarnos de que en las políticas y los programas concebidos en el contexto de la globalización se respeten plenamente los principios y propósitos de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y del derecho internacional, sobre todo en cuanto se refiere a la igualdad entre los Estados, el respeto de la independencia de los Estados, la soberanía nacional, la integridad territorial y la no injerencia en los asuntos internos de los Estados, y de destacar que dichos propósitos y principios inspiran nuestra plena adhesión al multilateralismo y dedicación a la búsqueda de un sistema económico internacional más justo y equitativo, que ofrezca oportunidades para elevar el nivel de vida de nuestros pueblos. 27. También recordamos la decisión adoptada en la Cumbre del Grupo de los 77 y China celebrada en Doha en 2005 de colaborar para la realización del derecho a la libre determinación de los pueblos que vivían bajo dominación colonial u otras formas de dominación u ocupación extranjera, lo que repercutía negativamente en su desarrollo social y económico, y de exhortar a la comunidad internacional a que adoptara todas las medidas necesarias para poner fin a la continuación de la ocupación extranjera, de acuerdo con los propósitos y principios de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y del derecho internacional. 28. Reafirmamos que los pueblos indígenas tienen derecho a conservar y reforzar sus propias instituciones políticas, jurídicas, económicas, sociales y culturales, manteniendo a la vez su derecho a participar plenamente, si lo desean, en la vida política, económica, social y cultural del Estado. A este respecto, ponemos de relieve la necesidad de respetar y salvaguardar las identidades culturales, los conocimientos y las tradiciones indígenas de nuestros países. Parte II Desarrollo en el contexto nacional Estrategias de desarrollo sostenible 29. Hacemos hincapié en la necesidad de incorporar aún más el desarrollo sostenible en todos los niveles, integrando los aspectos económicos, sociales y ambientales y reconociendo los vínculos que existen entre ellos, a fin de lograr el desarrollo sostenible en todas sus dimensiones. 30. Reafirmamos que cada país dispone de diferentes enfoques, visiones, modelos e instrumentos, en función de sus circunstancias y prioridades nacionales, para lograr el desarrollo sostenible en sus tres dimensiones, que es nuestro objetivo general (Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible). En algunos países existe el enfoque del "Vivir bien" con un desarrollo integral encaminado a alcanzar las necesidades materiales, culturales y espirituales de las sociedades en el contexto de la Armonía con la Naturaleza. 31. Reconocemos que la Tierra y sus ecosistemas son nuestro hogar y estamos convencidos de que, para alcanzar un justo equilibrio entre las necesidades económicas, sociales y ambientales de las generaciones presentes y futuras, es necesario promover la armonía con la naturaleza y la Tierra. También reconocemos que "Madre Tierra" es una expresión común utilizada para referirse al planeta Tierra en diversos países y regiones, lo que demuestra la interdependencia existente entre los seres humanos, las demás especies vivas y el planeta que todos habitamos. 32. Acogemos con beneplácito que en 2011 se celebrara el vigésimo quinto aniversario de la Declaración sobre el Derecho al Desarrollo, que es un importante documento histórico que establece el derecho de los países en desarrollo a actuar con miras a lograr el desarrollo y el derecho de los pueblos a participar en el desarrollo y beneficiarse de él. 33. En este contexto, reafirmamos que el desarrollo es un proceso global económico, social, cultural y político de carácter global que tiende al mejoramiento constante del bienestar de la población en general y de todos los individuos sobre la base de su participación activa, libre y significativa en el desarrollo y en la distribución justa de los beneficios que de él se derivan, como se reconoce en la Declaración sobre el Derecho al Desarrollo. 34. También reafirmamos la proclamación de la Declaración sobre el Derecho al Desarrollo de que el derecho al desarrollo es un derecho humano inalienable en virtud del cual todas las personas y todos los pueblos están facultados para participar en un desarrollo económico, social, cultural y político en el que puedan realizarse plenamente todos los derechos humanos y libertades fundamentales para contribuir a ese desarrollo y para disfrutar del él, como se reconoce en la Declaración. Mejoramiento de las prácticas de la democracia 35. Consideramos que la democracia es un valor universal basado en la voluntad libremente expresada de los pueblos de determinar sus propios sistemas políticos, económicos, sociales y culturales y participar plenamente en todos los aspectos de la vida. Reafirmamos que, si bien todas las democracias tienen características comunes, no existe un modelo único de democracia, y que la democracia no pertenece a ningún país o región, y reafirmamos además la necesidad de respetar debidamente la soberanía, la unidad y la integridad territorial y el derecho a la libre determinación, así como el rechazo de cualquier intento de desestabilizar los sistemas constitucionales y democráticos legítimamente establecidos por los pueblos. 36. Pedimos que los medios de comunicación dejen de utilizarse de modo que puedan difundir información distorsionada contra los Estados miembros del Grupo de los 77 haciendo caso omiso del principio del derecho internacional. 37. Expresamos nuestra profunda indignación y desaprobación por los hechos relacionados con el retiro sorpresivo de permisos de sobrevuelo y aterrizaje del avión presidencial en que viajaban el Presidente del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, Sr. Evo Morales Ayma, y su grupo el 2 de julio de 2013. Estos hechos constituyen actos hostiles e injustificables que además pusieron en grave riesgo la seguridad del Presidente Morales. Hacemos pública nuestra máxima solidaridad y exigimos que se aclaren los hechos. Soberanía nacional sobre los recursos naturales y beneficios de esos recursos 38. Afirmamos que los Estados tienen, de conformidad con la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y los principios del derecho internacional, el derecho soberano de aprovechar sus propios recursos según sus propias políticas ambientales y de desarrollo, y la responsabilidad de velar por que las actividades realizadas dentro de su jurisdicción o bajo su control no causen daños al medio ambiente de otros Estados o de zonas que estén fuera de los límites de la jurisdicción nacional. 39. Reafirmamos también que el derecho de los pueblos y de las naciones a la soberanía permanente sobre sus riquezas y recursos naturales debe ejercerse en interés del desarrollo nacional y del bienestar del pueblo del respectivo Estado. 40. Si bien hacemos hincapié en la soberanía de nuestros países y pueblos sobre sus recursos naturales, somos conscientes de que tenemos el deber de conservar, gestionar y utilizar esos recursos de manera sostenible, y de crear condiciones para que la Naturaleza y los ecosistemas puedan regenerarse, en beneficio de las generaciones presentes y futuras. También reconocemos que el uso sostenible de los recursos naturales es un medio eficaz de lograr el crecimiento económico y reducir la pobreza y la degradación del medio ambiente. 41. Tomamos nota de las decisiones adoptadas por algunos países para nacionalizar o recuperar el control de sus recursos naturales con el fin de obtener mayores beneficios para sus pueblos, en particular para las personas pobres, y para invertir en la diversificación económica, la industrialización y los programas sociales, y respetamos esas decisiones. 42. Instamos a que se proporcione asistencia técnica y para el fomento de la capacidad a los países en desarrollo a nivel internacional, regional y nacional, a fin de ayudarlos a obtener los máximos beneficios de la extracción y utilización de los recursos en consonancia con el desarrollo sostenible, teniendo en cuenta el pleno ejercicio del derecho soberano de nuestros países sobre sus recursos naturales. Erradicación de la pobreza 43. Reconocemos que la pobreza es una afrenta a la dignidad humana y destacamos que la erradicación de la pobreza es el mayor problema que afronta el mundo en la actualidad, y concedemos la máxima prioridad a la erradicación de la pobreza en la agenda de desarrollo de las Naciones Unidas para después de 2015, que debe apoyarse con medios efectivos y adecuados de aplicación y con una alianza mundial para el desarrollo fortalecida, y que entre otros objetivos entraña la promoción del empleo y el trabajo decente para todos, el mejoramiento del acceso a los servicios sociales, la erradicación del analfabetismo y las enfermedades, y la aplicación de estrategias nacionales y regionales integradas, coordinadas y coherentes. 44. Expresamos nuestra profunda preocupación por los problemas que afectan la lucha contra la pobreza como consecuencia de las crisis, en particular la crisis financiera y económica mundial, la continua inseguridad alimentaria, la volatilidad de las corrientes de capital y la extrema volatilidad de los precios de los productos básicos, el acceso a la energía y los problemas que plantea el cambio climático para los países en desarrollo. 45. Subrayamos también que, a fin de que los gobiernos de los países en desarrollo puedan erradicar efectivamente la pobreza, los países en desarrollo deben garantizar la implicación nacional en sus propios programas de desarrollo, lo que conlleva la preservación de sus propios márgenes de acción en materia de políticas respaldados por un firme compromiso político para reducir la pobreza de conformidad con sus prioridades y circunstancias nacionales. En consecuencia, los gobiernos de los países en desarrollo deben formular sus propias estrategias de desarrollo para ayudar a los pobres con políticas y medidas, entre las que cabe mencionar el fomento de un fuerte crecimiento económico sostenido e inclusivo, la concesión de prioridad a la generación de empleo, en particular para la población joven, el suministro de un mejor acceso universal y asequible a los servicios básicos, el establecimiento de un sistema de protección social bien concebido, el empoderamiento de las personas para que puedan aprovechar las oportunidades económicas y la adopción de medidas para garantizar la protección del medio ambiente. 46. Recordamos la Convención de las Naciones Unidas contra la Corrupción, que es el instrumento más completo y universal sobre la corrupción, y reconocemos la necesidad de seguir promoviendo la ratificación o la adhesión a la Convención y su plena aplicación. También reconocemos que la lucha contra la corrupción a todos los niveles es una prioridad, que la corrupción es un serio obstáculo para la movilización y asignación efectivas de recursos y que desvía recursos de actividades que son vitales para la erradicación de la pobreza y el desarrollo sostenible. 47. Tomamos nota con aprecio de los valores tradicionales y ancestrales de algunos de nuestros pueblos, como los principios andinos de ama suwa ("no seas ladrón"), ama llulla ("no seas mentiroso") y ama qhilla ("no seas perezoso") y que, de conformidad con todos los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales, contribuyen a los esfuerzos para prevenir y combatir la corrupción. Reducción de la desigualdad 48. Hacemos hincapié en que el problema de la desigualdad es más grave que nunca debido a la prevalencia de la riqueza extrema mientras se sigue padeciendo hambre y pobreza, y en que esta situación se agrava, entre otras cosas, por unas pautas de consumo y producción insostenibles, principalmente en los países desarrollados. Afirmamos que todo beneficio del crecimiento económico tiene que distribuirse de manera equitativa y debe beneficiar a las personas en situaciones vulnerables en nuestras comunidades, por lo que pedimos una vez más que se tomen medidas concertadas para reducir las desigualdades a todos los niveles. 49. Estamos profundamente preocupados por la insuficiencia de las medidas adoptadas para reducir la disparidad cada vez mayor que existe entre los países desarrollados y los países en desarrollo, así como dentro de los países, que ha contribuido, entre otras cosas, a agravar la pobreza y ha menoscabado el pleno disfrute de todos los derechos humanos, particularmente en los países en desarrollo. 50. También tomamos nota con preocupación de que el alto grado de desigualdad dentro de los países y entre ellos sigue repercutiendo negativamente en todos los aspectos del desarrollo humano y es especialmente perjudicial para las personas en situaciones vulnerables, quienes resultan afectadas por desigualdades interrelacionadas. Por lo tanto, instamos a los países a que, con el apoyo de la cooperación internacional y otros medios, intensifiquen los esfuerzos por ofrecer un acceso equitativo a las oportunidades y los resultados a todos los sectores de la sociedad, de conformidad con las políticas nacionales. 51. Entendemos que el desarrollo sostenible entraña un cambio en el orden de las prioridades de la generación de riqueza material a la satisfacción de las necesidades humanas en Armonía con la Naturaleza. La excesiva orientación hacia el lucro, no respeta la Madre Tierra ni tiene en cuenta las necesidades humanas. La continuación de este sistema desigual aumentará las desigualdades. Crecimiento económico sostenido e inclusivo 52. Afirmamos que el crecimiento económico sostenido, inclusivo y equitativo es necesario para erradicar la pobreza, generar empleo y elevar el nivel de vida de nuestros pueblos y generar ingresos públicos para financiar las políticas sociales. Observamos que los datos históricos han demostrado que ningún país ha logrado mejorar de modo constante las condiciones de vida y el desarrollo humano sin mantener un ritmo de crecimiento económico regular. Por lo tanto, instamos a la comunidad internacional y las Naciones Unidas a que ayuden a los países en desarrollo a lograr un crecimiento económico elevado y adecuado durante un período prolongado. 53. También somos conscientes de que un elevado crecimiento económico, aunque necesario, no basta por sí mismo. Somos conscientes de que el crecimiento económico debe ser sostenido e inclusivo generando puestos de trabajo y aumentando los ingresos de las personas en situaciones vulnerables, especialmente los pobres y los más necesitados. El crecimiento económico también debe ser racional desde el punto de vista ecológico y social, y para lograrlo, los países en desarrollo necesitan, entre otras fuentes, apoyo financiero y tecnológico de los países desarrollados con arreglo a los planes nacionales Creación de empleo 54. Expresamos la opinión de que la capacidad de generar empleo pleno y trabajo decente está fundamentalmente relacionada con la revitalización y el fortalecimiento de estrategias de desarrollo productivo, mediante la aplicación de políticas adecuadas en materia de financiación, inversión y comercio. A este respecto, reafirmamos la necesidad de movilizar una considerable cantidad de recursos procedentes de diversas fuentes y utilizar eficazmente los fondos a fin de apoyar firmemente a los países en desarrollo en sus iniciativas para promover el desarrollo sostenible. También subrayamos la necesidad de mantener la coherencia entre las políticas macroeconómicas y de creación de empleo para asegurar un crecimiento económico mundial inclusivo y resiliente. 55. Expresamos profunda preocupación por la persistencia de los altos niveles de desempleo y subempleo, en particular entre los jóvenes, y afirmamos nuestro compromiso de reducir el desempleo mediante políticas económicas y de desarrollo orientadas a generar un gran número de puestos de trabajo. Afirmamos la necesidad de poner en marcha un proceso intergubernamental, en el marco de las Naciones Unidas, a fin de incluir la cuestión del empleo de los jóvenes y las inquietudes de los jóvenes en el actual proceso de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015. Afirmamos también la importancia de asegurar unos medios de vida dignos para los agricultores de nuestros países. 56. Afirmamos la necesidad de poner en marcha un proceso intergubernamental, en el marco de las Naciones Unidas, para elaborar una estrategia mundial dirigida a mejorar la formación para el empleo y crear empleo para los jóvenes. Prestación de servicios básicos para nuestros pueblos 57. Nos preocupa que sigan existiendo diferencias sustanciales y cada vez mayores entre los ricos y los pobres del mundo, diferencias que no obedecen únicamente al reparto desigual de la riqueza, sino también a las disparidades en materia de acceso a los recursos y servicios básicos, lo que impide que se creen oportunidades económicas para todos. 58. Reconocemos la importante función que corresponde desempeñar al Estado para velar por que todas las personas tengan acceso a los servicios básicos y buscar soluciones a las desigualdades y la discriminación relativas a la distribución de esos servicios y el acceso a ellos. 59. También reafirmamos nuestra determinación de adoptar medidas que hagan efectivo el derecho de nuestros pueblos a acceder a los servicios básicos. 60. Reafirmamos nuestros compromisos respecto del derecho humano al agua potable y el saneamiento, que debe materializarse y hacerse efectivo gradualmente en beneficio de nuestra población, respetando plenamente nuestra soberanía nacional. 61. Exhortamos a los países donantes y las organizaciones internacionales a que registren progresos en el suministro de recursos financieros, la creación de capacidad y la transferencia de tecnología por medio de las actividades internacionales de prestación de asistencia a los países en desarrollo y de cooperación con ellos, a fin de intensificar los esfuerzos para proporcionar a toda la población un acceso económico y en condiciones de seguridad al agua potable y el saneamiento. Acceso a la salud pública y a los medicamentos 62. Reconocemos que la cobertura sanitaria universal implica que todas las personas tengan acceso, sin discriminación, a un conjunto de servicios médicos básicos de promoción, prevención, cura y rehabilitación que se ajuste a las necesidades y se determine a nivel nacional, así como a medicamentos esenciales, seguros, asequibles, eficaces y de calidad, al tiempo que se garantiza que la utilización de esos servicios no suponga graves dificultades económicas para los usuarios, especialmente para quienes se encuentran en situación vulnerable. 63. También reconocemos que en muchos países en desarrollo no existen los recursos financieros ni humanos ni la infraestructura necesaria para hacer efectivo el derecho de todas las personas a disfrutar del más alto nivel posible de salud física y mental. Por tanto, exhortamos a los países desarrollados y a las organizaciones internacionales competentes a que proporcionen a esos países recursos financieros y tecnológicos suficientes como complemento a sus esfuerzos para establecer políticas y medidas que proporcionen cobertura sanitaria universal y servicios básicos de salud para todos. 64. Observamos con gran preocupación que las enfermedades no transmisibles han alcanzado grandes dimensiones epidémicas que debilitan el desarrollo sostenible de los Estados miembros. En ese sentido, reconocemos la eficacia de las medidas de control del tabaco para mejorar la salud. Reafirmamos el derecho de los Estados miembros a proteger la salud pública y, en particular, a garantizar el acceso universal a los medicamentos y las tecnologías de diagnóstico médico, por ejemplo, utilizando de forma plena, si fuera necesario, las flexibilidades previstas en la Declaración de Doha relativa al Acuerdo sobre los Aspectos de los Derechos de Propiedad Intelectual Relacionados con el Comercio (ADPIC) y la Salud Pública. 65. Recordamos el contenido del párrafo 142 del documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible, en el que los Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno "reafirman el derecho a aplicar plenamente las disposiciones del Acuerdo ADPIC, la Declaración de Doha relativa al Acuerdo ADPIC y la Salud Pública, la decisión del Consejo General de la Organización Mundial del Comercio (OMC), de 30 de agosto de 2003, relacionada con la aplicación del párrafo 6 de la Declaración de Doha, y, cuando concluyan los procedimientos formales de aceptación, la enmienda al artículo 31 del Acuerdo ADPIC, que otorgan flexibilidad para la protección de la salud pública y, en particular, para promover el acceso universal a los medicamentos, y alientan a que se preste asistencia a los países en desarrollo a este respecto". Afirmamos la importancia de aprovechar las flexibilidades que ofrece el Acuerdo ADPIC para promover la salud de las personas y el acceso a los medicamentos. Exhortamos a los países desarrollados a que respeten plenamente el derecho de los países en desarrollo a aprovechar al máximo las flexibilidades previstas en el Acuerdo ADPIC y a que se abstengan de adoptar medidas, incluso de índole comercial, que impidan que los países en desarrollo ejerzan este derecho o que los disuadan de hacerlo. 66. Nos preocupa el creciente problema de la resistencia a los medicamentos antimicrobianos, incluidos los fármacos existentes para luchar contra la tuberculosis y la malaria. Como consecuencia de esto, un número cada vez mayor de enfermos, especialmente en los países en desarrollo, puede morir a causa de enfermedades que pueden prevenirse o tratarse. Instamos a las autoridades y organizaciones internacionales de la salud, en especial a la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), a que adopten medidas urgentes y a que, a solicitud de los países en desarrollo que no cuentan con los recursos adecuados, cooperen con ellos para solucionar este problema. Desarrollo agrícola y seguridad alimentaria 67. Recordamos que la seguridad alimentaria y la nutrición son elementos indispensables para alcanzar el desarrollo sostenible y expresamos nuestra preocupación por el hecho de que los países en desarrollo son vulnerables, entre otras cosas, a los efectos adversos del cambio climático, que amenazan todavía más la seguridad alimentaria. 68. Reafirmamos que el hambre es una violación de la dignidad humana e instamos a que se adopten medidas urgentes en los planos nacional, regional e internacional para eliminarla. Reafirmamos también el derecho de toda persona a disponer de alimentos sanos y nutritivos de conformidad con su derecho a una alimentación adecuada y su derecho fundamental a no padecer hambre, a fin de poder desarrollar y mantener su plena capacidad física y mental. Reconocemos también que la seguridad alimentaria y la nutrición son esenciales para el desarrollo sostenible y se han convertido en un desafío mundial apremiante y, a este respecto, reafirmamos también nuestro compromiso de aumentar la seguridad alimentaria y el acceso de las generaciones presentes y futuras a alimentos suficientes, sanos y nutritivos, en consonancia con los Cinco Principios de Roma para la Seguridad Alimentaria Mundial Sostenible, aprobados el 16 de noviembre de 2009, especialmente en favor de los niños menores de 2 años, y mediante estrategias de seguridad alimentaria y nutrición nacionales, regionales y mundiales, según proceda. 69. Denunciamos que las subvenciones y otras distorsiones del mercado impulsadas por los países desarrollados han perjudicado gravemente al sector agrícola de los países en desarrollo, limitando la capacidad de este sector fundamental para contribuir significativamente a la erradicación de la pobreza y a un crecimiento económico sostenido e incluyente, al desarrollo sostenible y equitativo, a la seguridad alimentaria y al desarrollo rural. Pedimos que se anulen de inmediato todas las formas de subvenciones agrícolas y otras medidas adoptadas por los países desarrollados que distorsionan los mercados y que no se ajustan a las normas establecidas por la OMC. Instamos a los países desarrollados a que demuestren la flexibilidad y la voluntad política necesarias para abordar debidamente estas preocupaciones fundamentales de los países en desarrollo en la Ronda de Doha de negociaciones comerciales. 70. Reiteramos nuestro compromiso de concluir disciplinas multilaterales sobre las subvenciones a la pesca que den efecto al Programa de Doha para el Desarrollo, de la OMC, y a los mandatos de la Declaración Ministerial de Hong Kong para hacer más estrictas las disciplinas sobre las subvenciones en el sector pesquero, incluso prohibiendo determinadas modalidades de subvenciones a la pesca que contribuyen a la capacidad de pesca excesiva y la sobrepesca, reconociendo que la negociación en la OMC de las subvenciones a la pesca debe incluir un trato especial y diferenciado, apropiado y efectivo para los países en desarrollo y menos adelantados, teniendo en cuenta la importancia del sector para las prioridades de desarrollo, la reducción de la pobreza y las cuestiones relativas a los medios de subsistencia y la seguridad alimentaria. 71. Ponemos de relieve la necesidad de fortalecer la capacidad de nuestros países, en especial mediante la cooperación internacional, para salvaguardar y mejorar la calidad de la nutrición de nuestros pueblos, promoviendo sus prácticas productivas, culturales y ambientales. 72. Ponemos de relieve también la urgente necesidad de intensificar en los planos nacional, regional e internacional los esfuerzos para alcanzar la seguridad alimentaria y el desarrollo agrícola como parte fundamental de la agenda internacional para el desarrollo. Exigimos una financiación sostenida y más inversiones dirigidas concretamente a aumentar la producción de alimentos en el mundo, y pedimos recursos financieros nuevos y adicionales de todas las fuentes para materializar el desarrollo agrícola sostenible y la seguridad alimentaria. 73. Ponemos de relieve además la necesidad de fortalecer el sector agrícola, en el contexto de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 y sus medios de aplicación, a fin de alcanzar la seguridad alimentaria, destacando la importancia de que en las estrategias nacionales, regionales e internacionales dirigidas a alcanzar esa seguridad se incluyan los conocimientos, las prácticas y las tecnologías propias de los pueblos indígenas, las comunidades rurales y los pequeños y medianos productores agrícolas. 74. Acogemos con beneplácito la adopción de las resoluciones de la Asamblea General 68/177 sobre el derecho a la alimentación y 68/233 sobre desarrollo agrícola, seguridad alimentaria y nutrición. Acogemos con beneplácito también la Segunda Conferencia Internacional sobre Nutrición, convocada por la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Alimentación y la Agricultura (FAO) y la OMS, que tendrá lugar en la sede de la FAO en Roma del 19 al 21 de noviembre de 2014, con objeto de aprobar el marco normativo sobre nutrición para las próximas décadas y definir las prioridades que regirán la cooperación internacional en el ámbito de la nutrición a corto y mediano plazos. 75. Acogemos con beneplácito la decisión del Director General de la FAO de nombrar por segundo año consecutivo al Sr. Juan Evo Morales Ayma, Presidente del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, y a la Sra. Nadine Heredia Alarcón, Primera Dama del Perú, Embajadores Especiales ante la FAO para el Año Internacional de la Quinua, en reconocimiento de su liderazgo y compromiso en la lucha contra el hambre y la malnutrición, y de la labor realizada por los Gobiernos de Bolivia y el Perú para mostrar al mundo los beneficios y la calidad de esa fuente andina de alimento. 76. Reafirmamos que la biodiversidad y el valor nutricional de la quinua la convierten en un elemento clave para la seguridad alimentaria, la nutrición y la erradicación de la pobreza, así como para promover los conocimientos tradicionales de los pueblos indígenas andinos; contribuir al logro de la seguridad alimentaria, la nutrición y la erradicación de la pobreza; crear conciencia sobre su contribución al desarrollo social, económico y ambiental; e intercambiar buenas prácticas sobre la realización de actividades. 77. Llamamos a que se creen unas condiciones propicias para el surgimiento de oportunidades económicas provechosas para los pequeños agricultores y las explotaciones familiares, los campesinos y los pueblos y las comunidades indígenas, y a que se establezcan vías para conectar a estos grupos con los consumidores, en el marco de las estrategias nacionales para hacer efectivo el derecho a la alimentación. 78. Reconocemos la función positiva que desempeñan los pequeños agricultores y las explotaciones familiares, incluidas las mujeres, las cooperativas, los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades locales de los países en desarrollo, así como sus conocimientos y prácticas en la conservación y el uso sostenible de las semillas, la biodiversidad agrícola y la biodiversidad vinculada a la producción de alimentos de las generaciones presentes y futuras. 79. Destacamos la necesidad de hacer frente a las causas profundas de la inestabilidad excesiva de los precios de los alimentos, incluidas sus causas estructurales, en todos los niveles, y de gestionar los riesgos derivados de la inestabilidad excesiva de los precios de los productos básicos agrícolas y sus consecuencias para la seguridad alimentaria y la nutrición a nivel mundial, así como para los pequeños agricultores y los pobres de las zonas urbanas. 80. Llamamos a que en la ronda de negociaciones de Doha de la OMC se conceda prioridad al desarrollo y, en concreto, a la seguridad alimentaria, de conformidad con el Programa de Doha para el Desarrollo. Llamamos a que se promuevan los medios de subsistencia de los pequeños agricultores y el desarrollo rural en los países en desarrollo. En este contexto, instamos a los miembros de la OMC a que adopten, lo antes posible, una solución permanente para la cuestión de las existencias públicas de alimentos y la seguridad alimentaria en relación con los países en desarrollo, como se acordó mediante la Decisión Ministerial de la OMC aprobada en Bali (Indonesia) en 2013. Agricultura familiar sostenible 81. Declaramos que la agricultura familiar y las pequeñas explotaciones agrícolas son una base importante para la producción sostenible de alimentos orientada a lograr la seguridad alimentaria (resolución 66/222 de la Asamblea General). En este contexto, debería prestarse apoyo a la actividad económica de la agricultura familiar sostenible, teniendo en cuenta los conocimientos tradicionales de los pequeños agricultores, a fin de mejorar su situación y promover su desarrollo, en particular facilitando su acceso a los servicios financieros, los recursos productivos y los insumos agrícolas, como las tierras, las semillas, los medios tecnológicos adecuados, el transporte y la información. 82. Fomentaremos la adopción de medidas exhaustivas y complementarias tanto a nivel nacional como regional en materia de producción, acceso y consumo sobre la base de una planificación integral, multisectorial y participativa, volviendo a evaluar y fortaleciendo la agricultura familiar sostenible, las pequeñas explotaciones agrícolas, y las prácticas agrícolas de los pueblos indígenas y los afrodescendientes. Industrialización e infraestructura 83. Afirmamos que el desarrollo industrial y la creación de valor añadido, junto con la ciencia, la tecnología y la innovación, son, entre otros, elementos esenciales para que los países en desarrollo alcancen mayores niveles de desarrollo de manera sostenida, dado que el proceso de industrialización puede generar una mayor productividad, más puestos de trabajo y competencias técnicas y efectos positivos indirectos en la economía. En consecuencia, instamos a los países desarrollados a que ayuden a los países en desarrollo a impulsar la industrialización en sus estrategias y políticas de desarrollo y a promover el desarrollo industrial sostenible con arreglo a sus intereses nacionales. 84. Observamos que muchos países en desarrollo aún dependen excesivamente de los productos básicos y hacemos notar que deberían estudiar estrategias de diversificación industrial mediante, entre otras cosas, el aumento de las capacidades productivas con valor añadido. 85. Exhortamos a las organizaciones internacionales competentes y pedimos a los mecanismos de cooperación internacional que presten una asistencia adecuada a los países en desarrollo, incluso mediante la transferencia de tecnología, para que puedan desarrollar su capacidad para formular y aplicar políticas y estrategias de industrialización, de conformidad con sus prioridades nacionales. 86. Pedimos que en el sistema comercial internacional se respete y consolide el margen normativo de los países en desarrollo para la promoción y el crecimiento de nuestro desarrollo industrial y para la formulación y aplicación de nuestras estrategias industriales. A ese respecto, pedimos que se haga una revisión de todas las normas del sistema comercial mundial que afecten al espacio normativo de los países en desarrollo. 87. Afirmamos que el desarrollo de infraestructuras fiables y económicas, la conectividad regional, y su apropiada interrelación a través de la ciencia, la tecnología y la innovación, incluidos el transporte, las carreteras, la energía y las telecomunicaciones, así como la promoción del acceso a los mercados para las exportaciones procedentes de los países en desarrollo, son elementos esenciales para mejorar la calidad de vida de nuestros pueblos y el desarrollo sostenible de nuestros países. 88. En ese sentido, instamos a los países desarrollados y las organizaciones internacionales a que, en consonancia con los compromisos asumidos en el plano internacional, proporcionen asistencia financiera suficiente para apoyar la transferencia de tecnologías fiables y de costo razonable y promover la creación de capacidad, teniendo en cuenta las prioridades nacionales. 89. Instamos a los países desarrollados a que proporcionen asistencia técnica, transferencia de tecnología y recursos financieros para que nuestros países puedan industrializarse y desarrollar la infraestructura por medios que sean sostenibles en el plano ambiental. 90. Ponemos de relieve a ese respecto la importancia que reviste la asistencia técnica para el desarrollo industrial de los Estados Miembros con el fin de adoptar modalidades de consumo y producción sostenibles menos contaminantes, basadas en los recursos y de alto rendimiento energético, que incluyan tecnologías menos contaminantes para el aprovechamiento de los combustibles fósiles. 91. Acogemos con beneplácito la iniciativa del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, en su calidad de Presidente del Grupo de los 77 y China, de organizar la Reunión de ministros de industrialización o autoridades equivalentes del Grupo de los 77 y China sobre la cuestión de la gobernanza de los recursos naturales y la industrialización, en coordinación con la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo Industrial (ONUDI), la Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe, la Comisión Económica para África, la Comisión Económica y Social para Asia y el Pacífico y la Comisión Económica y Social para Asia Occidental, reunión que se celebrará en Tarija en agosto de 2014. 92. Acogemos con beneplácito la Declaración de Lima: hacia un desarrollo industrial inclusivo y sostenible, aprobada en el 15º período de sesiones de la Conferencia General de la ONUDI que se celebró en Lima en diciembre de 2013, como un paso importante en nuestros esfuerzos por lograr el desarrollo sostenible y la erradicación de la pobreza. Inclusión de la mujer en el desarrollo 93. Recordamos el documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible, reafirmamos el papel fundamental de la mujer y la necesidad de lograr su participación y liderazgo plenos y en pie de igualdad en todos los ámbitos del desarrollo sostenible, y decidimos acelerar el cumplimiento de nuestros respectivos compromisos en este sentido, que figuran en la Convención sobre la Eliminación de Todas las Formas de Discriminación contra la Mujer, así como en el Programa 21, la Declaración y Plataforma de Acción de Beijing, la Declaración del Milenio y el Programa de Acción de la Conferencia Internacional sobre la Población y el Desarrollo de 1994. 94. Reconocemos también que el potencial de las mujeres para colaborar en el desarrollo sostenible, contribuir a este y beneficiarse de él como líderes, participantes y agentes de cambio no se ha hecho plenamente efectivo. Apoyamos que se asigne prioridad a las medidas para promover la igualdad entre los géneros y el empoderamiento de las mujeres y las niñas en todas las esferas de nuestras sociedades. Resolvemos aprovechar el potencial de las mujeres como impulsoras del desarrollo sostenible por numerosos medios y nos comprometemos a crear un entorno propicio para mejorar la situación de las mujeres y las niñas en todas partes, especialmente en las zonas rurales y las comunidades locales, así como entre los pueblos indígenas y las minorías étnicas. 95. Estamos comprometidos a lograr la igualdad de derechos y oportunidades de las mujeres en la adopción de decisiones políticas y económicas y la asignación de recursos, a otorgar a las mujeres iguales derechos que los hombres a los recursos económicos y a asegurar su acceso a la educación, las finanzas, las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones, los mercados, la asistencia letrada y otros servicios básicos, entre ellos los servicios de atención de la salud, incluidos los métodos modernos seguros, eficaces, asequibles y aceptables de planificación familiar. 96. Recordamos los compromisos respectivos que asumimos con arreglo a la resolución 61/143 de la Asamblea General y otras resoluciones sobre la cuestión, reconocemos que la violencia contra la mujer viola gravemente todos sus derechos humanos, y acordamos por tanto adoptar medidas para eliminar todas las formas de violencia contra la mujer, incluidos el feminicidio y la discriminación de las mujeres y las niñas, mediante una respuesta más sistemática, amplia, multisectorial y sostenida, apoyada y facilitada adecuadamente por sólidos mecanismos institucionales y métodos de financiación, así como por planes de acción nacionales, incluidos los que se realizan con el apoyo de la cooperación internacional, y, según proceda, por planes nacionales de desarrollo, incluidas las estrategias de erradicación de la pobreza y los enfoques sectoriales y basados en los programas. 97. Reafirmamos el compromiso de trabajar juntos para formular una agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 con perspectiva de género. 98. Instamos a que se haga frente a los problemas fundamentales que siguen teniendo las mujeres y las niñas mediante un enfoque amplio y con vocación transformadora y hacemos un llamamiento para que la igualdad entre los géneros y el empoderamiento de las mujeres y las niñas se recojan en un objetivo de desarrollo sostenible independiente y se incorporen por medio de metas en las políticas inclusivas para superar la pobreza y fomentar el desarrollo social y económico de nuestros países. Pueblos indígenas 99. Instamos a trabajar en pro de la realización de los derechos de los pueblos indígenas sobre sus tierras, recursos naturales, identidad y cultura, de conformidad con la legislación nacional. Reafirmamos nuestros compromisos respectivos de cumplir nuestras obligaciones jurídicas, en particular, según proceda, el Convenio núm. 169 de la Organización Internacional del Trabajo, así como de promover la aplicación de la Declaración de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Derechos de los Pueblos Indígenas. 100. Reafirmamos el valor y la diversidad de las culturas y las formas de organización social de los pueblos indígenas y sus conocimientos científicos e innovaciones y prácticas tradicionales holísticas, que contribuyen de manera significativa a fortalecer los medios de vida de la población local, garantizar la seguridad alimentaria y hacer frente al cambio climático. 101. Destacamos la importancia de los pueblos indígenas para el logro del desarrollo sostenible en los países en desarrollo y la función crucial que desempeñan en los procesos sociales, económicos y políticos de nuestros países, a la vez que fortalecen los puntos de vista y valores locales conocidos como visiones holísticas de la Madre Tierra. 102. Reafirmamos la importancia de la acción colectiva y los esfuerzos de las comunidades indígenas y locales para conservar la diversidad biológica, teniendo en cuenta que contribuyen decisivamente a la ordenación y gestión sostenible de los recursos naturales renovables. 103. Consideramos que la adaptación al cambio climático y la mitigación de sus efectos dependen de los distintos contextos socioculturales, teniendo especialmente en cuenta a los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades locales y sus sistemas de conocimientos y prácticas tradicionales, incluida su visión holística de la comunidad y el medio ambiente, como un importante medio de adaptación al cambio climático. 104. Pedimos que se fortalezca el diálogo intercientífico entre los sistemas de conocimientos tradicionales e indígenas y las ciencias modernas en el contexto de la Plataforma Intergubernamental Científico-Normativa sobre Diversidad Biológica y Servicios de los Ecosistemas y del marco conceptual "Vivir bien en armonía y equilibrio con la Madre Tierra", aprobado por la Plataforma. 105. Acogemos con beneplácito que se haya convocado la reunión plenaria de alto nivel del sexagésimo noveno período de sesiones de la Asamblea General, que con el nombre de Conferencia Mundial de Pueblos Indígenas se celebrará en Nueva York los días 22 y 23 de septiembre de 2014, con el fin de intercambiar ideas y mejores prácticas sobre la aplicación de la Declaración de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Derechos de los Pueblos Indígenas. El documento final de la Conferencia, que estará orientado a la acción, debe contribuir a la realización de los derechos de los pueblos indígenas y la consecución de los objetivos de la Declaración y promover el logro de todos los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente. 106. Tomamos nota de la Declaración especial sobre la hoja de coca suscrita en La Habana el 29 de enero de 2014 por los Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno de los países de América Latina y el Caribe reunidos en ocasión de la Cumbre de Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno de la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños, en la que se reconoce la importancia de conservar las prácticas culturales y ancestrales de los pueblos originarios, en el marco del respeto de los derechos humanos y los derechos fundamentales de los pueblos indígenas, de conformidad con los instrumentos internacionales pertinentes. En ese contexto, los Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno reconocen el masticado (akulliku o chacchado) de la hoja de coca como una manifestación cultural ancestral de los pueblos de la región andina, que debe ser respetada por la comunidad internacional, y expresan interés en conocer los resultados de investigaciones científicas acerca de las propiedades de la hoja de coca realizadas por institutos y universidades de la comunidad internacional de reconocido prestigio en la materia. Parte III Cooperación Sur-Sur 107. Reafirmamos el documento final de Nairobi de la Conferencia de Alto Nivel de las Naciones Unidas sobre la Cooperación Sur-Sur y, por lo tanto, reconocemos la importancia, las diferencias históricas y las particularidades de la cooperación Sur-Sur, y reafirmamos nuestra opinión de que la cooperación Sur-Sur es una expresión de solidaridad entre los pueblos y países del Sur que contribuye a su bienestar nacional, su autosuficiencia nacional y colectiva y el logro de los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente, incluidos los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio. La cooperación Sur-Sur y su programa deben ser determinados por los países del Sur y seguir orientándose por los principios del respeto de la soberanía, la implicación y la independencia nacionales, la igualdad, la no condicionalidad, la no injerencia en los asuntos internos y el beneficio mutuo. 108. Reafirmamos la importancia de fortalecer la cooperación Sur-Sur, especialmente en el actual entorno económico internacional, y reiteramos nuestro apoyo a la cooperación Sur-Sur como estrategia para respaldar la labor de los países en desarrollo en pro del desarrollo y como medio de fomentar su participación en la economía mundial. Reiteramos la posición del Grupo de que la cooperación Sur-Sur complementa, pero no sustituye, a la cooperación Norte-Sur y reafirmamos que se trata de un empeño colectivo de los países en desarrollo basado en el principio de solidaridad y en premisas, condiciones y objetivos específicos del contexto histórico y político de los países en desarrollo y de sus necesidades y expectativas, por lo que la cooperación Sur-Sur debería fomentarse de modo separado e independiente, tal y como se reafirmó en el documento final de Nairobi. En este contexto, recalcamos que la cooperación Sur-Sur y su programa deben ser impulsados por los países del Sur. La cooperación Sur-Sur, que es fundamental para los países en desarrollo, exige una perspectiva de largo plazo y el mecanismo institucional mundial previsto en la Segunda Cumbre del Sur. 109. Acogemos con beneplácito la reunión del Grupo de Alto Nivel de Personalidades Eminentes del Sur, celebrada en Natadola (Fiji) del 7 al 9 de mayo de 2013, de conformidad con el mandato pertinente de la Segunda Cumbre del Sur. Acogemos con beneplácito también las conclusiones y recomendaciones del Grupo sobre el panorama futuro de la cooperación Sur-Sur como una contribución importante para el desarrollo ulterior de la Plataforma de Desarrollo para el Sur. Reiteramos el marco y los principios de la cooperación Sur-Sur que los Ministros de Relaciones Exteriores del Grupo de los 77 hicieron suyos por primera vez en su 32ª reunión anual, celebrada en Nueva York el 26 de septiembre de 2008, que el Grupo utilizó también como base para sus deliberaciones. 110. Acogemos con beneplácito la conclusión de la tercera ronda de negociaciones del Sistema Global de Preferencias Comerciales, que es un instrumento para promover y fortalecer la integración comercial Sur-Sur y exhortamos a que más países en desarrollo participen en el Sistema Global. 111. También señalamos y acogemos con beneplácito el aumento de las iniciativas de cooperación regional que manifiestan de manera concreta la cooperación y la integración Sur-Sur en esferas diversas como las finanzas, la banca, el comercio, la atención de la salud y la producción de alimentos. Esperamos que estas iniciativas beneficien no solo a los participantes en los programas regionales, sino también a otros países en desarrollo. Hacemos un llamamiento para que se adopten otras iniciativas en el futuro, así como maneras concretas en que los países en desarrollo puedan intercambiar experiencias y buenas prácticas para difundir estas iniciativas Sur-Sur. 112. Alentamos a nuestros países a intercambiar experiencias y mejores prácticas en materia de igualdad de acceso a los servicios básicos para todos. 113. Destacamos que el Comité de Alto Nivel sobre la Cooperación Sur-Sur, de la Asamblea General, es el principal organismo normativo multilateral del sistema de las Naciones Unidas encargado de examinar y evaluar los progresos realizados a nivel mundial y en todo el sistema y el apoyo en materia de cooperación Sur-Sur para el desarrollo, incluida la cooperación triangular, y de impartir orientación general sobre la dirección futura. 114. Destacamos también que la cooperación Sur-Sur, como elemento importante de la cooperación internacional para el desarrollo, no sustituye, sino que complementa la cooperación Norte-Sur y que su programa debe ser establecido por los países del Sur. Apoyamos la integración de la cooperación Sur-Sur y la cooperación triangular en las políticas y el marco estratégico de los fondos y programas del sistema de las Naciones Unidas, así como su fortalecimiento mediante la asignación a nivel de todo el sistema de recursos adicionales, entre ellos recursos financieros y humanos, a la Oficina de las Naciones Unidas para la Cooperación Sur-Sur, y reconocemos que la Oficina, acogida actualmente por el Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD), constituye una entidad separada, con un carácter jurídico particular, encargada de la coordinación, a nivel mundial y en el sistema de las Naciones Unidas, de la promoción y facilitación de iniciativas relacionadas con la cooperación Sur-Sur para el desarrollo. 115. En este sentido, solicitamos que se establezca un mecanismo de coordinación interinstitucional más formal y robusto para la Oficina de las Naciones Unidas para la Cooperación Sur-Sur, a fin de alentar la prestación de un apoyo conjunto a las iniciativas de cooperación Sur-Sur y de cooperación triangular, y de intercambiar información sobre las actividades de desarrollo y los resultados obtenidos por los distintos fondos, organismos y organizaciones en apoyo de la cooperación Sur-Sur y la cooperación triangular. 116. Exhortamos también al Sistema de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo a promover la transferencia de tecnologías desde los países desarrollados en beneficio de los países en desarrollo a fin de resolver las cuestiones relativas a la erradicación de la pobreza y el desarrollo sostenible, y, en este contexto, alentamos, en la medida de lo posible, la cooperación tecnológica entre los países del Sur. 117. Reconocemos el papel desempeñado por el Centro del Sur en el apoyo al Grupo de los 77. Exhortamos a los miembros del Grupo a que sigan apoyando la labor del Centro y al Centro a que amplíe sus actividades en beneficio de los países en desarrollo. Alentamos a las organizaciones de países en desarrollo, incluidos los del Centro del Sur, a aportar ideas y proponer planes de acción para seguir llevando a la práctica la cooperación Sur-Sur. Parte IV Desafíos mundiales Alianza mundial para el desarrollo 118. Desatacamos la necesidad de que los países desarrollados asuman un nuevo y mayor compromiso con la cooperación internacional a fin de prestar apoyo al cumplimiento de las aspiraciones de desarrollo de los países en desarrollo. En el marco de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio, se asumió un compromiso respecto de una alianza mundial para el desarrollo, que representaba la dimensión de cooperación internacional del marco de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio. No obstante, observamos con preocupación el considerable retraso en la alianza en relación con los Objetivos, que contribuyó a que no se lograran muchos de los objetivos y de las metas. Por consiguiente, pedimos que se cumplan urgentemente todos los compromisos asumidos en el marco de la alianza mundial para el desarrollo con el fin de corregir los desfases señalados en los informes del Equipo de Tareas sobre el Desfase en el Logro de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio. 119. También exhortamos a los dirigentes de los países desarrollados a que convengan en una nueva fase de cooperación internacional, y se comprometan con ella, mediante el fortalecimiento y la ampliación de la alianza mundial para el desarrollo, que debería ser el elemento central y el ancla tanto de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible como de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015. Esta alianza mundial fortalecida debería incluir las cuestiones relativas al suministro de recursos financieros a los países en desarrollo, la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo, el alivio de la deuda y la reestructuración de la deuda, el comercio, la transferencia de tecnología y una mayor participación de los países en desarrollo en la gobernanza económica mundial. Asistencia oficial para el desarrollo 120. Reafirmamos que la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo sigue siendo la principal fuente internacional de financiación para muchos países en desarrollo y que es esencial como catalizador del desarrollo, ya que facilita el logro de los objetivos de desarrollo nacionales, incluida la labor inconclusa de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio, los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible y la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015, de conformidad con lo establecido en el párrafo 246 del documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible ("El futuro que queremos"). 121. Destacamos que los países desarrollados deben cumplir y ampliar los compromisos asumidos en materia de asistencia oficial para el desarrollo y los objetivos fijados, por ejemplo, en la Declaración del Milenio de las Naciones Unidas, el Consenso de Monterrey, el Documento Final de la Cumbre Mundial de 2005, la Declaración de Doha sobre la Financiación para el Desarrollo y en otros foros pertinentes. Para hacer frente a los consabidos problemas de desarrollo y a los problemas nuevos e incipientes que están surgiendo en los países en desarrollo, en particular los menos adelantados, es indispensable que las corrientes de la asistencia para el desarrollo aumenten y sean más previsibles y sostenibles. Recordamos el incumplimiento del compromiso contraído por los países desarrollados en la reunión celebrada en Gleneagles (Reino de Gran Bretaña e Irlanda del Norte). 122. Instamos a los países desarrollados a que cumplan su compromiso de asignar el 0,7% del ingreso nacional bruto a la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo para los países en desarrollo, así como de lograr la meta de destinar del 0,15% al 0,20% de su ingreso nacional bruto a la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo para los países menos adelantados y la de aumentarla al 1% del ingreso nacional bruto para el año 2030. Expresamos nuestra profunda preocupación por el hecho de que siguen sin cumplirse los compromisos relativos a la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo. 123. Los países desarrollados no pueden utilizar la crisis financiera y económica mundial como pretexto para eludir el cumplimiento de los compromisos ya contraídos en materia de ayuda o la asunción de nuevos compromisos. Para responder con eficacia a la crisis económica, es necesario cumplir puntualmente los compromisos existentes en materia de ayuda, siendo apremiante e ineludiblemente necesario que los donantes los cumplan. Por lo tanto, exhortamos colectivamente a los países desarrollados a que cumplan los compromisos asumidos en materia de asistencia oficial para el desarrollo y aumenten aún más los niveles de ayuda en general, teniendo en cuenta que los países en desarrollo requerirán nuevos recursos financieros adicionales y sostenibles, en gran medida y cuantía, para poner en práctica una amplia gama de actividades de desarrollo. 124. Destacamos la necesidad de asegurar un apoyo financiero nuevo y adicional a los países en desarrollo como uno de los principales medios de ejecución para alcanzar los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio y los próximos Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible. La asistencia financiera debería proporcionarse sin supeditarla a condiciones, puesto que las estrategias de desarrollo deberían ser dirigidas por los países y deberían tener en cuenta las condiciones, necesidades y prioridades propias de los países en desarrollo. Debería basarse en el principio de la responsabilidad común pero diferenciada y en la cooperación Norte-Sur como elemento fundamental y la Cooperación Sur-Sur y la cooperación triangular como complementos útiles. 125. Destacamos que la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo es una fuente importante para financiar el desarrollo de los países en desarrollo que debería utilizarse de conformidad con las prioridades nacionales en materia de desarrollo de esos países, sin condiciones; y expresamos nuestra profunda preocupación por los intentos realizados por países donantes, fuera de los foros de las Naciones Unidas, de redefinir la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo incluyendo otras fuentes de financiación que no están vinculadas o relacionadas con el desarrollo de los países en desarrollo, con el objetivo de ocultar la disminución de las corrientes de asistencia oficial para el desarrollo que no se ajusta a los compromisos que acordaron y que aún no han cumplido. Deuda externa 126. Nos preocupa el hecho de que, con la crisis económica mundial, las economías de un número cada vez mayor de países en desarrollo se están viendo afectadas y de que algunos países se están volviendo más vulnerables a nuevos problemas relacionados con la deuda externa o incluso a crisis. Por consiguiente, resolver los problemas de la deuda externa de los países en desarrollo constituye una parte importante de la cooperación internacional y de la alianza mundial para el desarrollo fortalecida. 127. Opinamos que las crisis de la deuda suelen ser costosas y perturbadoras, y que por lo general van seguidas de grandes recortes del gasto público y de una disminución del crecimiento económico y el empleo. Esas crisis afectan más profundamente a los países en desarrollo, y los que están muy endeudados no pueden regresar a la senda del crecimiento sin asistencia internacional. Reconocemos la importancia que tiene el alivio de la deuda, incluidos los procesos de cancelación, reestructuración, moratoria y auditoría de la deuda. Los procesos de reestructuración de la deuda deben tener como elemento central la determinación de la capacidad real de pago, de modo que no afecten negativamente el crecimiento económico ni el cumplimiento de la tarea inconclusa de hacer realidad los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio, los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible y la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015. A este respecto, reiteramos la necesidad urgente de que la comunidad internacional examine diferentes opciones para establecer un mecanismo internacional de solución del problema de la deuda, que sea eficaz, equitativo, duradero, independiente y orientado al desarrollo, y exhortamos a todos los países a que promuevan los debates que se celebran en el seno de las Naciones Unidas y en otros foros pertinentes, y a que contribuyan a ellos. 128. También recordamos que en decenios anteriores y en los últimos años la gestión de la deuda soberana ha sido una cuestión crucial para los países en desarrollo. En los últimos tiempos, ha surgido una nueva preocupación relacionada con las actividades de los fondos buitre. Algunos ejemplos recientes de las acciones de los fondos buitre en los tribunales internacionales han puesto de manifiesto su carácter altamente especulativo. Esos fondos plantean un peligro para todos los procesos futuros de reestructuración de la deuda, tanto para los países en desarrollo, como para los países desarrollados. Por consiguiente, reiteramos la importancia de no permitir que los fondos buitre paralicen las actividades de reestructuración de la deuda de los países en desarrollo ni priven a los Estados de su derecho a proteger a su pueblo conforme al derecho internacional. 129. Expresamos nuestra grave preocupación por el aumento considerable de los riesgos en materia de estabilidad financiera que encaran muchas economías desarrolladas y, en particular, por las grandes debilidades estructurales que tienen esas economías para financiar la deuda soberana creada como resultado de la transferencia del riesgo privado al sector público. A este respecto, instamos a buscar soluciones urgentes y coherentes que permitan reducir el riesgo soberano de las economías desarrolladas, a fin de prevenir el contagio y mitigar su efecto en el sistema financiero internacional y los países en desarrollo. 130. Hacemos hincapié en la necesidad de asegurar que las políticas económicas y monetarias aplicadas por los países desarrollados no afecten a la demanda agregada y la liquidez mundiales, debido al objetivo de buscar el superávit en sus balanzas de pagos, lo que tiene resultados negativos que se traducen en la reducción de los ingresos globales de los países en desarrollo. Reforma de la estructura financiera mundial 131. Afirmamos la necesidad de reformar la estructura financiera internacional, de manera que tengamos un sistema financiero y monetario que refleje las realidades del siglo XXI, incluido un sector financiero internacional debidamente reglamentado que reduzca y desestimule las inversiones especulativas, a fin de que se puedan movilizar los mercados de capital para alcanzar el desarrollo sostenible, y de que esos mercados desempeñen un papel constructivo en la agenda mundial para el desarrollo. 132. También observamos que siguen existiendo problemas fundamentales en el sistema financiero y monetario mundial, en particular la falta de regulación para garantizar la estabilidad financiera, los problemas de las monedas de reserva, la inestabilidad de los tipos de cambio, las grandes corrientes transfronterizas de capital especulativo y la insuficiencia o inexistencia de liquidez para los países en desarrollo necesitados de recursos financieros, que encaran un déficit de divisas o que requieren recursos para generar un crecimiento y desarrollo sostenibles. Pedimos un programa de reformas, en el que los países en desarrollo tengan voz, representación y participación plenas para hallar una solución a esos problemas. 133. Observamos con preocupación que la desregulación y la liberalización financieras han dado lugar a una enorme ampliación de las corrientes financieras especulativas y del comercio de derivados. La crisis económica y financiera de 2008 ha demostrado que las finanzas internacionales han creado una economía propia, cada vez más desconectada de la economía real de la producción, las inversiones directas, la creación de empleo y el crecimiento de los salarios. Entre los efectos negativos de la financialización se incluyen la inestabilidad de las corrientes de capital, las fluctuaciones excesivas de los precios de los productos básicos y los alimentos, las rápidas fluctuaciones cambiarias y los ciclos de auge y caída en las crisis financieras y la recesión económica. 134. Instamos a que el proceso de reforma de la estructura de gobernanza de las Instituciones de Bretton Woods se finalice lo antes posible y sea mucho más ambicioso, y a que se establezca un plan acelerado de introducción de nuevas reformas en lo relacionado con la representación, la participación y la paridad del número de votos de los países en desarrollo en el proceso de adopción de decisiones de las Instituciones de Bretton Woods y en todos los debates sobre la reforma monetaria internacional, así como en el funcionamiento de los nuevos acuerdos sobre los derechos especiales de giro del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI), sobre la base de criterios que reflejen verdaderamente su mandato en la esfera del desarrollo y con la participación de todas las partes interesadas en un proceso transparente, consultivo e incluyente. A este respecto, pedimos a la Asamblea General que ponga en marcha un proceso de reforma del sistema financiero y monetario internacional. 135. Apoyamos el examen de la posibilidad de crear un mecanismo intergubernamental de las Naciones Unidas en el marco de la Asamblea General, como entidad responsable de supervisar el funcionamiento del sistema económico y financiero mundial de forma integral y sostenible. Es fundamental que este mecanismo supervise el impacto de determinadas corrientes y políticas financieras internacionales que son sistemáticamente importantes para prevenir la propagación de las crisis económicas y financieras entre los países. Reforma del sistema de calificación crediticia 136. Destacamos que en las medidas internacionales para volver a regular al sector financiero se debería incluir a las agencias de calificación crediticia. Los gobiernos deberían limitar su dependencia normativa de las agencias de calificación crediticia y reformar sus regímenes jurídicos para responsabilizar a esas agencias por el comportamiento negligente a fin de eliminar los conflictos de intereses y asegurar la integridad, la rendición de cuentas y la transparencia. 137. También recalcamos la necesidad de contar con un sistema internacional de calificación crediticia más transparente que tenga plenamente en cuenta las necesidades, preocupaciones y peculiaridades de los países en desarrollo, en particular de los muy endeudados. En este sentido, expresamos nuestra preocupación por la solidez de la metodología utilizada por las principales agencias de calificación crediticia. Ponemos de relieve que es necesario aumentar la transparencia de esas agencias y la competencia entre ellas, a fin de evitar las tendencias oligopolísticas y sus efectos negativos. Reiteramos que la evaluación inadecuada de la solvencia de los deudores puede generar o exacerbar las crisis y, con ello, aumentar la vulnerabilidad del sistema financiero. Es necesario proseguir los debates en las Naciones Unidas y otros foros sobre el papel de las agencias de calificación crediticia, con miras a proponer políticas concretas que permitan reducir la dependencia que se tiene de esas agencias mejorando su supervisión y aumentando la transparencia y la competencia mediante el establecimiento de mecanismos de evaluación independientes. Gobernanza económica mundial 138. Afirmamos que la actual crisis financiera y económica mundial y sus consecuencias para el desarrollo han puesto de relieve las deficiencias y los fracasos de la gobernanza económica mundial, en particular en el seno de las instituciones financieras internacionales, y la necesidad urgente de que la comunidad internacional dé una respuesta global, universal e integrada. Observamos con profunda preocupación que siete años después del inicio de la crisis mundial ha habido pocos progresos para fortalecer los aspectos sistémicos, reglamentarios y estructurales del sistema financiero mundial. Además, persiste la falta de participación de los países en desarrollo en general en las cuestiones económicas mundiales y la gobernanza; esto es motivo de grave preocupación porque el funcionamiento del sistema mundial afecta a todos los países, y este déficit democrático tiene consecuencias aún más graves para los países en desarrollo cuando la economía mundial se está desacelerando o en recesión. 139. Exhortamos firmemente a la comunidad internacional a que corrija el déficit democrático en la gobernanza económica mundial y proporcione a los países en desarrollo el lugar que legítimamente les corresponde y participación en la gobernanza y la adopción de decisiones en todas las instituciones y foros donde se realicen debates y se adopten decisiones sobre cuestiones económicas y financieras mundiales. 140. Afirmamos que la labor para reformar la estructura financiera internacional se debería por tanto reforzar seriamente y coordinar a nivel internacional, y debería conducir a la plena participación de los países en desarrollo en la adopción de decisiones y el establecimiento de normas en los ámbitos financiero y económico internacionales. Pedimos una reforma amplia de las instituciones de Bretton Woods, incluido el fortalecimiento del poder de voto de los países en desarrollo en un plazo estipulado, a fin de lograr mayor equidad entre países desarrollados y países en desarrollo y eliminar todo tipo de condiciones relacionadas con la ayuda. 141. Pedimos que se complete con urgencia la reformar de la fórmula de cálculo de las cuotas que hizo el FMI en 2010 para garantizar que las cuotas y la gobernanza del FMI reflejen mejor el peso relativo de los países emergentes y en desarrollo en la economía mundial. Sin embargo, una redistribución del derecho de voto solo para reflejar la realidad no resolverá los problemas estructurales de inestabilidad financiera y de falta de liquidez que necesitan solucionar los países en desarrollo para generar los niveles necesarios de crecimiento y desarrollo sostenibles. Además, la reforma debería abarcar la creación de liquidez, en particular la mejora de los derechos especiales de giro para los países en desarrollo. El FMI debe responder a las necesidades de los países en desarrollo en el ámbito financiero de manera más equilibrada y flexible, sin imponer condiciones procíclicas y respetando su necesidad de un margen normativo adecuado. Además, el personal de nivel superior de las instituciones de Bretton Woods debería designarse en función de sus méritos individuales mediante un proceso de selección abierto y justo. Mientras el FMI no refleje las nuevas realidades de la economía mundial y se siga designando a su Director General mediante un proceso carente de transparencia, se seguirá poniendo en entredicho su legitimidad. 142. Destacamos la necesidad de celebrar una conferencia internacional de seguimiento de la financiación para el desarrollo en 2015 para examinar la aplicación del Consenso de Monterrey y la Declaración de Doha con el fin de contribuir al proceso de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015. 143. Al tiempo que respetamos los propósitos y principios de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y el carácter intergubernamental de la Organización, reconocemos la importante función de las Naciones Unidas al constituir un foro intergubernamental, incluso por medio de conferencias y cumbres internacionales, para el diálogo universal y el consenso sobre los retos mundiales, con la debida participación de los interesados pertinentes. 144. Reafirmamos la posición central que ocupa la Asamblea General en su calidad de principal órgano de deliberación, adopción de políticas y representación de las Naciones Unidas, así como la función de la Asamblea en los asuntos mundiales de interés para la comunidad internacional, como establece la Carta de las Naciones Unidas. Fortalecimiento y reorientación de las Naciones Unidas 145. Reafirmamos nuestro compromiso de aumentar la participación de los países en desarrollo en los órganos de adopción de decisiones de las instituciones multilaterales a fin de que sean más acordes con la realidad geopolítica actual. 146. Subrayamos la importancia de la función central de las Naciones Unidas en la gobernanza económica mundial, que tiene por objeto mejorar la asociación mundial para el desarrollo, con miras a crear un entorno mundial propicio y favorable para el logro del desarrollo sostenible y asegurar la estabilidad financiera y económica. En este contexto, la Asamblea General y un Consejo Económico y Social fortalecido podrían actuar para mitigar los efectos de la crisis financiera y económica internacional y garantizar el derecho de los países en desarrollo a un margen normativo para el desarrollo sostenible. 147. Destacamos que el fortalecimiento del sistema de las Naciones Unidas y de su función en la cooperación internacional en pro del desarrollo es fundamental para aprovechar las oportunidades y afrontar los problemas resultantes del proceso de globalización, tanto en la actualidad como en el futuro. Reconocemos que es preciso que las Naciones Unidas mejoren sus medios y capacidades para cumplir plenamente sus mandatos y asegurar la ejecución eficaz de sus programas en el ámbito del desarrollo social y económico. A ese respecto, instamos al Secretario General a que siga reforzando el componente de desarrollo en toda la Organización, incluida su Cuenta para el Desarrollo. 148. Instamos a los países desarrollados a que demuestren una voluntad política genuina a fin de que en el proceso de reforma de las Naciones Unidas, incluido el fortalecimiento y la revitalización de la Asamblea General como emblema de la soberanía global, pueda mejorar sus medios y capacidades para desempeñar plenamente sus mandatos y asegurar la ejecución efectiva de su programa en los ámbitos social, ambiental y de desarrollo económico. 149. Destacamos que el fortalecimiento del sistema de las Naciones Unidas y de su función en la cooperación internacional en pro del desarrollo es fundamental para aprovechar las oportunidades y afrontar los problemas resultantes del proceso de globalización, tanto en la actualidad como en el futuro. En este contexto, expresamos nuestra preocupación por el creciente desequilibrio entre las cuotas y las contribuciones voluntarias en los proyectos de presupuesto por programas de la Organización. Destacamos también que el nivel de recursos que apruebe la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas debe ser suficiente para que todos los programas y actividades encomendados puedan ejecutarse íntegra y eficazmente. 150. Reafirmamos que ninguna iniciativa de reforma de la Secretaría y la administración, inclusive de los procesos presupuestarios, debe tener como propósito alterar el carácter intergubernamental, multilateral e internacional de la Organización, sino el de reforzar la capacidad de los Estados Miembros para cumplir su función de supervisión y vigilancia, y que el examen y la aprobación previos por los Estados Miembros son indispensables en todos los casos en que las medidas que hayan de aplicarse guarden relación con las prerrogativas de la Asamblea General, y a este respecto, recordamos la resolución 66/257. Reiteramos también la necesidad de aumentar la representación de los países en desarrollo y la representación de las mujeres de los países en desarrollo, en particular en las categorías superiores, y de mejorar la distribución geográfica en la Secretaría y aumentar la transparencia en el proceso de contratación. 151. Pedimos que continúen los esfuerzos por reformar las Naciones Unidas, incluida la revitalización de la Asamblea General y una reforma amplia del Consejo de Seguridad, que correspondan a los intereses colectivos de los países en desarrollo. 152. Expresamos preocupación por los recortes presupuestarios que afectan negativamente la ejecución de los mandatos aprobados por los órganos intergubernamentales de las Naciones Unidas, en particular en el componente de desarrollo, y el creciente desequilibrio entre las cuotas y las contribuciones voluntarias. 153. Pedimos una mayor transparencia, rendición de cuentas y supervisión por parte de los Estados Miembros respecto de las contribuciones voluntarias y los recursos extrapresupuestarios. Es importante que los recursos provenientes de las contribuciones voluntarias y los recursos extrapresupuestarios se utilicen para apoyar todas las prioridades acordadas por los Estados Miembros y se empleen estrictamente de conformidad con el Reglamento Financiero y Reglamentación Financiera Detallada de la Organización convenidos intergubernamentalmente. 154. Recalcamos la función central de las Naciones Unidas en la gobernanza económica mundial como foro multilateral verdaderamente universal e inclusivo, con una legitimidad incuestionable, poder de convocatoria y marcos normativos. Ponemos de relieve el importante papel que debería desempeñar la Asamblea General en el nombramiento del Secretario General de las Naciones Unidas, previa recomendación del Consejo de Seguridad de conformidad con el Artículo 97 de la Carta. En ese sentido, destacamos que el proceso de selección del Secretario General debería incluir a todos los Estados Miembros y ser más transparente. Además, consideramos que la rotación regional, así como el respeto de la representación geográfica equitativa, deberían tenerse en cuenta durante los procesos de selección y nombramiento. 155. Reconocemos también la importancia de aumentar el número de nacionales de países en desarrollo en los niveles superiores de la Secretaría, en particular en el Grupo Superior de Gestión. Transferencia de tecnología, ciencia e innovación para el desarrollo 156. Creemos que la integración de la ciencia, los conocimientos y la integración de la tecnología y la innovación deben ser instrumentos para promover la paz y el desarrollo sostenible de las personas, su bienestar y felicidad, y que, por tanto, deben estar orientados a promover el empoderamiento de los pobres, la erradicación de la pobreza y el hambre, la promoción de la solidaridad y la complementariedad entre y dentro de los pueblos para que puedan vivir bien en armonía con la Madre Tierra. 157. Expresamos nuestra preocupación por que la ciencia, la tecnología y la innovación puedan ser utilizadas indebidamente como instrumentos para limitar y socavar la soberanía de los países, el desarrollo sostenible y la erradicación de la pobreza. 158. Pedimos que se ponga fin a la utilización de tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones, incluidas las redes sociales, en contravención del derecho internacional y en detrimento de cualquier Estado, en particular los miembros del Grupo de los 77 o sus ciudadanos. 159. Reafirmamos que la tecnología es esencial para hacer frente a los problemas de desarrollo en una amplia variedad de cuestiones, como la alimentación y la agricultura, el agua y el saneamiento, el cambio climático, la energía, la industria y la gestión de productos químicos y de desechos. La transferencia de tecnología, la integración de la tecnología y el desarrollo y la promoción de tecnologías endógenas son importantes para que los países en desarrollo generen crecimiento económico de manera ecológicamente sostenible. Exhortamos a los países desarrollados a cumplir sus compromisos de transferir tecnología a los países en desarrollo y facilitar el acceso a tecnología en condiciones favorables, incluso en condiciones de favor y preferenciales, para que los países en desarrollo puedan optar a una vía de desarrollo más sostenible. 160. Es fundamental que los países desarrollados se vuelvan a comprometer con el objetivo de la transferencia de tecnología como uno de los principales componentes, junto con las finanzas, el desarrollo de la capacidad y el comercio, de la provisión de medios de realización del desarrollo sostenible para los países en desarrollo, y que tomen medidas para zanjar la brecha tecnológica. Pedimos la pronta creación por el sistema de las Naciones Unidas de un mecanismo de facilitación de la tecnología que promueva el desarrollo, la transferencia y la difusión de tecnologías limpias y ambientalmente racionales, incluidas tecnologías de combustibles fósiles menos contaminantes. 161. Pedimos que las reglamentaciones y las políticas sobre la propiedad intelectual se incluyan en un marco de desarrollo, en virtud del cual los derechos de propiedad intelectual se orienten hacia la promoción de un desarrollo social, económico y ambiental equilibrado. En este sentido, apoyamos las medidas adoptadas por los países en desarrollo para promover la aplicación de las recomendaciones adoptadas en el marco de la Agenda de la Organización Mundial de la Propiedad Intelectual (OMPI) para el Desarrollo de 2007. Reiteramos nuestro llamamiento en el párrafo 8 vii) del Plan de Acción de Doha de 2005, aprobado en la Segunda Cumbre del Grupo de los 77, de que la OMPI siga incluyendo en sus planes y actividades futuros, entre otras cosas, asesoramiento jurídico, una dimensión de desarrollo que abarque la promoción del desarrollo y el acceso de todos al conocimiento, el establecimiento de normas que favorezcan el desarrollo, la armonización con las normas del Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica, el establecimiento de principios que favorezcan el desarrollo y la transferencia y difusión de tecnología. 162. También reiteramos que el Acuerdo sobre los Aspectos de los Derechos de Propiedad Intelectual Relacionados con el Comercio (ADPIC) de la OMC contiene medidas de flexibilidad y que los Estados en desarrollo miembros de la OMC tienen derecho a utilizarlas, como se confirmó en la Declaración Ministerial de la OMC de 2001 relativa al Acuerdo sobre los ADPIC y la Salud Pública, y apoyamos el uso de esas disposiciones que prevén flexibilidad en nuestros países con el fin de promover la salud, la educación y el desarrollo económico y social. Observamos con gran interés y aprecio que algunos países en desarrollo han hecho uso con éxito de algunas medidas de flexibilidad de los ADPIC para promover el uso de medicamentos genéricos, que tienen menor costo y, por tanto, aumentan en gran medida el acceso a medicamentos a precios asequibles. Rechazamos los intentos de cualquier país desarrollado o de cualesquiera intereses comerciales de presionar a los países en desarrollo a fin de que no ejerzan su derecho a hacer uso de las medidas de flexibilidad del Acuerdo ADPIC para fines sociales y de desarrollo, y expresamos nuestra solidaridad con los países en desarrollo que han sido objeto de presiones de esa índole. 163. Destacamos la necesidad de proteger los conocimientos de los países en desarrollo, los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades locales respecto a los recursos genéticos, la biodiversidad y los conocimientos tradicionales, en particular de los intentos constantes de personas o empresas de patentar esos recursos y conocimientos sin la aprobación de los países, los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades de que se trate. 164. Pedimos que se intensifiquen las medidas de nuestros negociadores y encargados de formular políticas para establecer mecanismos jurídicos a nivel internacional o nacional a fin de prevenir la biopiratería exigiendo la divulgación del país de origen y de pruebas de acuerdos de participación en los beneficios por los solicitantes de esas patentes. Pedimos también disposiciones firmes y mecanismos eficaces para la transferencia de tecnología, en particular el tratamiento adecuado de la propiedad intelectual, en el régimen internacional relativo al cambio climático en la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático. Comercio 165. Creemos que el comercio en el contexto de políticas y normas apropiadas puede ser un instrumento importante para el desarrollo económico. Debido a la crisis financiera y económica mundial que continúa, se ha producido un declive del comercio que ha tenido graves efectos en muchos países en desarrollo a causa del descenso de los ingresos de las exportaciones, las barreras comerciales y los subsidios que distorsionan el comercio en los países en desarrollo, y el acceso restringido a la financiación del comercio y la disminución de las inversiones en la diversificación de la producción y en la promoción de las exportaciones y sigue siendo motivo de preocupación. Es esencial establecer y mantener un sistema comercial multilateral universal, justo, basado en normas, abierto, favorable al desarrollo, no discriminatorio, inclusivo y equitativo que contribuya al crecimiento, al desarrollo sostenible y al empleo, en particular en los países en desarrollo. 166. Pedimos que concluya oportuna y satisfactoriamente la Ronda de Doha de negociaciones comerciales multilaterales, que debe atenerse plenamente a su mandato en materia de desarrollo y estar centrada en las necesidades y prioridades de los países en desarrollo. Tras la Conferencia Ministerial de la OMC celebrada en Bali en 2013, pedimos un proceso de negociación inclusivo y transparente y que se dé prioridad a los intereses y problemas de los países en desarrollo en el programa posterior a Bali. Vemos con preocupación que algunos países desarrollados miembros de la OMC tienen más interés en obtener acceso a los mercados de los países en desarrollo, pero no están dispuestos a adoptar medidas adecuadas para eliminar o reducir el proteccionismo en su sector de la agricultura ni a facilitar más acceso a los mercados a los países en desarrollo. 167. Reiteramos que los países desarrollados deben proporcionar una asistencia técnica y una creación de capacidad relacionadas con el comercio eficaces, financiadas adecuadamente y adaptadas a las necesidades y las limitaciones específicas de los países en desarrollo, en particular mediante el Marco Integrado Mejorado de la OMC, para abordar las limitaciones de los países menos adelantados respecto de la infraestructura y la capacidad productiva relacionadas con la oferta y el comercio. Asimismo, es fundamental que los países en desarrollo tengan acceso a asistencia financiera y técnica para desarrollar su capacidad a fin de aplicar efectivamente el nuevo Acuerdo sobre Facilitación del Comercio de la OMC. En este contexto, debe prestarse especial atención, entre otros elementos, a los proyectos y programas orientados a desarrollar y fortalecer corredores para reducir los costos del tránsito internacional. 168. Ponemos de relieve la importancia de facilitar la adhesión a la OMC. El proceso de adhesión debe acelerarse sin impedimentos políticos y de manera expedita y transparente para los países en desarrollo, en plena conformidad con las normas de la OMC. Esto contribuiría a la integración rápida y plena de los países en desarrollo en el sistema comercial multilateral. 169. Creemos que las normas comerciales, en la OMC o en los acuerdos de comercio bilaterales y regionales, deberían permitir que los países en desarrollo dispongan de suficiente margen normativo para que puedan hacer uso de instrumentos y medidas de políticas necesarios para su desarrollo económico y social. Reiteramos nuestra petición de que se fortalezca de manera efectiva el trato especial y diferenciado y los principios y las disposiciones de la OMC que no conlleven una reciprocidad plena a fin de ampliar el margen normativo de los países en desarrollo y permitirles beneficiarse más del sistema comercial multilateral. También pedimos que los acuerdos bilaterales de comercio e inversión entre países desarrollados y países en desarrollo tengan un trato especial y diferenciado suficiente para los países en desarrollo para que puedan conservar un margen normativo adecuado para el desarrollo social y económico. Migración 170. Consideramos que el nexo entre la migración y el desarrollo deben abordarse de manera integral, teniendo en cuenta las dimensiones económica, social y ambiental e incluir una perspectiva cultural y humana. Reconocemos la necesidad de abordar esta cuestión mediante la cooperación y el diálogo internacionales, regionales o bilaterales y a través de un enfoque amplio, equilibrado, coordinado y consistente, reconociendo las funciones y responsabilidades de los países de origen, tránsito y destino en la promoción y la protección efectivas de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de todos los migrantes y sus familiares, especialmente los de las mujeres y los niños, independientemente de su situación migratoria. 171. Observamos que a pesar de los progresos logrados en los debates, el diálogo y la cooperación a nivel internacional, la migración aún no se reflejaba adecuadamente en los marcos de desarrollo, los programas de desarrollo y las políticas sectoriales tanto nacionales como mundiales. Por tanto, estamos explorando la posibilidad de una convención jurídicamente vinculante sobre la migración y el desarrollo para mejorar la gobernanza de la migración internacional, proteger y promover los derechos humanos de los migrantes y su contribución al desarrollo, independientemente de su situación migratoria. 172. Reconocemos la importante función que desempeñan los migrantes como asociados en el desarrollo de los países de origen, tránsito y destino y la necesidad de mejorar la protección de todos los derechos humanos y libertades fundamentales de los trabajadores migratorios y sus familiares. También destacamos la necesidad de seguir examinando el reconocimiento de las calificaciones y competencias de los migrantes y su acceso a servicios financieros de bajo costo para las remesas. Cambio climático 173. Afirmamos que la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático es el principal foro internacional intergubernamental para negociar la respuesta mundial al cambio climático. En este sentido, destacamos que la respuesta internacional al cambio climático debe respetar plenamente los principios, disposiciones y objetivo último de la Convención, en particular los principios de equidad y de responsabilidades comunes pero diferenciadas y las capacidades respectivas. 174. Reiteramos que la consecución del objetivo último de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático requerirá reforzar el régimen multilateral basado en normas en virtud de la Convención, y por tanto, reafirmamos además la importancia de continuar las negociaciones sobre el cambio climático en el marco de la Convención de conformidad con sus principios y disposiciones, y aprobar en 2015 un protocolo, otro instrumento jurídico o una conclusión acordada con fuerza legal en el marco de la Convención aplicable a todas las partes. 175. Recordamos que el cambio climático es uno de los problemas mundiales más graves de nuestro tiempo. Recalcamos que los países en desarrollo siguen siendo los que más sufren los efectos adversos del cambio climático, el aumento de la frecuencia e intensidad de los fenómenos meteorológicos extremos y las consecuencias de las medidas de respuesta, a pesar de que son los que menos contribuyen al cambio climático. En consecuencia, pedimos a los países desarrollados que encabecen la respuesta al cambio climático. El cambio climático pone en peligro no solo las perspectivas de desarrollo de los países en desarrollo y su logro del desarrollo sostenible, sino también la propia existencia y supervivencia de los países y las sociedades. 176. Reconocemos que los países de baja altitud y otros pequeños países insulares, los países en desarrollo con zonas costeras bajas, zonas áridas y semiáridas o zonas expuestas a inundaciones, sequía y desertificación, y los países en desarrollo con ecosistemas montañosos frágiles, son particularmente vulnerables a los efectos adversos del cambio climático. 177. Reafirmamos la importancia de la aplicación del mecanismo de Varsovia para las pérdidas y los daños relacionados con las repercusiones del cambio climático, aprobado en el 19º período de sesiones de la Conferencia de las Partes en la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático, celebrada en Varsovia del 11 al 23 de noviembre de 2013 (decisión 2/CP.19). Reconocemos también la necesidad urgente de adoptar medidas concretas en este año, antes de la celebración del 20º período de sesiones de la Conferencia de las Partes, que tendrá lugar en Lima, para la puesta en marcha inmediata del mecanismo. 178. Hacemos hincapié en que los países desarrollados, habida cuenta de su responsabilidad histórica, deben tomar las riendas a la hora de abordar ese reto acogiéndose a los principios y las disposiciones de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático, en particular los principios de responsabilidades comunes pero diferenciadas y las capacidades respectivas y de equidad, y proporcionar apoyo financiero y tecnológico a los países en desarrollo en forma transparente, adecuada y previsible con arreglo a una modalidad de vigilancia, presentación de informes y verificación. 179. Reiteramos que la medida en que los países en desarrollo lleven a la práctica efectivamente sus compromisos en virtud de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático dependerá de la manera en que los países desarrollados lleven a la práctica efectivamente sus compromisos en virtud de la Convención relativos a los recursos financieros y la transferencia de tecnología y tengan plenamente en cuenta que el desarrollo económico y social y la erradicación de la pobreza son las prioridades primeras y absolutas de los países en desarrollo. 180. Destacamos la necesidad de resolver urgentemente la cuestión del establecimiento de objetivos deliberadamente poco ambiciosos, y manifestamos preocupación por la falta de cumplimiento de los compromisos por los países desarrollados. Para hacer frente a esas dificultades, la atención no debe limitarse solamente a la mitigación sino abordar también las lagunas en materia de financiación, tecnología y apoyo para el desarrollo de capacidad, equilibradas con un enfoque centrado en la adaptación al cambio climático. Ponemos de relieve que los países desarrollados deben asumir compromisos de mitigación firmes y ambiciosos, con metas cuantitativas ambiciosas respecto de la reducción y la limitación de emisiones, de acuerdo con los niveles dictados por la ciencia y establecidos en la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático. 181. Reiteramos la urgencia de acelerar el proceso de puesta en marcha del Fondo Verde para el Clima y de su pronta capitalización, y exhortamos a los países desarrollados a alcanzar el objetivo de movilizar 100.000 millones de dólares cada año para 2020 a fin de atender a las necesidades de los países en desarrollo. 182. Afirmamos nuestro apoyo para el éxito de la reunión que se celebrará en la República Bolivariana de Venezuela antes del 20º período de sesiones de la Conferencia de las Partes que se celebrará en Lima, y reafirmamos la necesidad de lograr progresos en las negociaciones para alcanzar un acuerdo ambicioso, equilibrado, justo y eficaz en el marco de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático, de conformidad con sus principios y disposiciones, que se acordará en 2015 y entrará en vigor en 2020 que realmente contribuya a la estabilización del sistema climático. Biodiversidad 183. Reafirmamos el reconocimiento que figura en el documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible acerca de la gravedad de la pérdida mundial de biodiversidad y la degradación de los ecosistemas, y ponemos de relieve que socavan el desarrollo mundial, afectan a la seguridad alimentaria y la nutrición, el abastecimiento de agua y el acceso al agua, la salud de los pobres del medio rural y de los pueblos de todo el mundo, incluidas las generaciones presentes y futuras. Esto resalta la importancia de conservar la biodiversidad, reforzar la conectividad del hábitat y aumentar la resiliencia de los ecosistemas. 184. Reconocemos la importancia del papel de las medidas colectivas de los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades locales para proteger, utilizar y conservar la biodiversidad. Reafirmamos también que los conocimientos, innovaciones y prácticas tradicionales de los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades locales aportan una contribución importante a la conservación y uso sostenible de la biodiversidad y que su aplicación más amplia puede apoyar el bienestar social y los medios de vida sostenibles. Reconocemos además que a menudo los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades locales son los que más directamente dependen de la biodiversidad y los ecosistemas, y por tanto, con frecuencia son los más inmediatamente afectados por su pérdida y degradación. 185. Acogemos con beneplácito los importantes resultados de la 11ª reunión de la Conferencia de las Partes en el Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica, celebrada en Hyderabad (India) en octubre de 2012, en particular el compromiso de duplicar las corrientes financieras internacionales relacionadas con la biodiversidad hacia los países en desarrollo para 2015 y como mínimo mantener ese nivel hasta 2020 a fin de contribuir a alcanzar los tres objetivos del Convenio. Exhortamos también a las Partes en el Convenio a examinar los avances a ese respecto en la 12ª reunión de la Conferencia de las Partes con miras a adoptar una meta definitiva para la movilización de recursos. 186. Acogemos con beneplácito la reunión informativa conjunta celebrada en 2013 por el Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Medio Ambiente, la OMPI, la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura, el PNUD, la UNCTAD, la secretaría del Tratado Internacional sobre los Recursos Fitogenéticos para la Alimentación y la Agricultura y la secretaría del Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica sobre la aplicación de los objetivos del Convenio, incluidas las medidas adoptadas para promover el acceso a los recursos genéticos y la distribución justa y equitativa de los beneficios derivados de su utilización y los conocimientos tradicionales conexos. Señalamos que se deberían alentar interacciones similares, reconociendo los respectivos mandatos de las organizaciones participantes, y exhortamos a todos los Estados Miembros, en particular a los países desarrollados, a que aceleren el proceso de ratificación del Protocolo de Nagoya sobre acceso a los recursos genéticos y participación justa y equitativa en los beneficios que se deriven de su utilización al Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica. 187. Observamos con profunda preocupación el aumento sin precedentes de la caza furtiva y el comercio ilícito de vida silvestre y sus productos en todas las regiones, en particular de colmillos de elefante y cuernos de rinoceronte. Destacamos que esa tendencia es perjudicial para el equilibrio ecológico, promueve la delincuencia dentro y a través de las fronteras y se le debe poner fin con urgencia a fin de evitar invertir decenios de ganancias con la conservación. Por tanto, condenamos enérgicamente la caza furtiva y los delitos relacionados con el tráfico ilícito de fauna y flora silvestres, y acordamos aumentar la cooperación internacional de conformidad con la Convención sobre el Comercio Internacional de Especies Amenazadas de Fauna y Flora Silvestres y otros acuerdos pertinentes para poner freno a esas prácticas, hacer frente a la demanda y la oferta de la flora y la fauna silvestres y sus productos, y aumentar la capacidad de las comunidades afectadas por ese tráfico para promover oportunidades de medios de vida sostenibles. Bosques 188. Resaltamos los beneficios sociales, económicos y ambientales que tienen los bosques para las personas y las contribuciones de la gestión forestal sostenible al objetivo del desarrollo sostenible. Apoyamos las políticas intersectoriales e interinstitucionales que promuevan la gestión forestal sostenible (Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible) y reconocemos también la importancia de los enfoques holísticos, integrales y alternativos para la gestión forestal sostenible elaborados en el marco de las negociaciones sobre el cambio climático. 189. Observamos el resultado del décimo período de sesiones del Foro de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Bosques, celebrado en Estambul (Turquía), del 8 al 19 de abril de 2013, y recalcamos la importancia de los cuatro objetivos mundiales sobre los bosques para la comunidad internacional en su conjunto, en particular para los países en desarrollo. El cuarto objetivo mundial es particularmente pertinente para los países en desarrollo, ya que señala la necesidad de invertir la disminución de la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo y movilizar recursos financieros nuevos y adicionales para aplicar una gestión forestal sostenible. Para cumplir el cuarto objetivo mundial es fundamental respetar el principio de responsabilidades comunes pero diferenciadas entre los países desarrollados y en desarrollo. A este respecto, instamos a los países desarrollados a ejercer una voluntad política firme y la flexibilidad necesaria para contribuir a lograr la gestión forestal sostenible. 190. Pedimos que se establezca un nuevo fondo silvícola mundial que esté en consonancia con los principios del desarrollo sostenible. Consideramos que es necesario a fin de canalizar la financiación necesaria para los países en desarrollo a fin de gestionar de manera sostenible sus bosques. Desertificación, degradación de las tierras y sequía 191. Reafirmamos que la desertificación, la degradación de las tierras y la sequía son motivos de grave preocupación para los países en desarrollo. Por tanto, es urgente que se adopten medidas internacionales encaminadas a hacer frente a esos problemas. Ponemos de relieve la gran importancia de la Convención de las Naciones Unidas de Lucha contra la Desertificación en los Países Afectados por Sequía Grave o Desertificación, en Particular en África, destacando que la desertificación, la degradación de las tierras y la sequía socavan las tres dimensiones del desarrollo sostenible. Reiteramos que hacer frente a la desertificación, la degradación de las tierras y la sequía permite a los países abordar varios retos en materia de política de escala mundial, como la seguridad alimentaria, la adaptación al cambio climático y la migración forzada. En este contexto, observamos la realización del 11º período de sesiones de la Conferencia de las Partes en la Convención de Lucha contra la Desertificación, celebrado en Windhoek del 16 al 27 de septiembre de 2013. 192. Reiteramos la necesidad de cooperar mediante el intercambio de información sobre el clima y meteorológica y los sistemas de pronóstico y alerta temprana relacionados con la desertificación, la degradación de las tierras y la sequía, así como sobre las tormentas de polvo y arena, a nivel mundial, regional y subregional. En este sentido, invitamos a los Estados y a las organizaciones competentes a que cooperen en el intercambio de la información y los sistemas de pronóstico y alerta temprana conexos. Océanos y mares 193. Destacamos la importancia de la conservación y el uso sostenible de los océanos y mares y sus recursos para el desarrollo sostenible, en particular debido a su contribución a la erradicación de la pobreza, el desarrollo económico sostenido, la seguridad alimentaria, la creación de medios de vida sostenibles y trabajo decente, así como de la protección de la biodiversidad y el medio marino y las medidas para hacer frente a los efectos del cambio climático. Por tanto, nos comprometemos a proteger y restablecer la salud, la productividad y la resiliencia de los océanos y ecosistemas marinos, mantener su biodiversidad, promover su conservación y uso sostenible para las generaciones presentes y futuras y lograr las tres dimensiones del desarrollo sostenible. Gobernanza de Internet, incluido el derecho a la intimidad 194. Vemos con consternación que algunos países han realizado recientemente actividades de vigilancia o de interceptación de las comunicaciones extensas, arbitrarias e ilegales, incluidas la vigilancia o la interceptación extraterritoriales de comunicaciones y la recopilación de datos personales, incluso a gran escala, de personas e instituciones de otros países, en particular de dirigentes políticos, altos funcionarios y diversos departamentos gubernamentales y organismos, así como de ciudadanos. Pedimos que se ponga fin a esas actividades, que violan el derecho humano a la intimidad de las personas y tienen efectos negativos en las relaciones entre los países. En este sentido, pedimos que entidades intergubernamentales examinen y revisen el uso de las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones a fin de asegurar que se ajusten plenamente al derecho internacional, incluido el derecho de los derechos humanos, de conformidad con los propósitos y principios de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas. 195. Acogemos con beneplácito la celebración de NETmundial, la Reunión Global de Múltiples Partes Interesadas sobre el Futuro de la Gobernanza de Internet, que tuvo lugar en São Paulo (Brasil), los días 23 y 24 de abril de 2014, y tomamos nota de su documento final. 196. Ponemos de relieve las importantes posibilidades que ofrecen las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones, incluidas las redes sociales y la infraestructura conexa, como medio para promover un mejor entendimiento entre las naciones y el logro de los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente. 197. Reconocemos al mismo tiempo que el uso ilegal de las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones tiene efectos negativos en las naciones y sus ciudadanos. En este sentido, expresamos nuestro firme rechazo a la utilización de las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones en violación del derecho internacional, incluido el derecho a la intimidad, y a toda medida de esta índole dirigida contra cualquier Estado Miembro, en particular un Estado miembro del Grupo de los 77. 198. Subrayamos además la importancia de velar por que la utilización de esas tecnologías sea plenamente compatible con los propósitos y principios de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y del derecho internacional, en particular los principios de soberanía, no injerencia en los asuntos internos y las normas internacionalmente reconocidas de la coexistencia civil entre los Estados. 199. En este sentido, observamos con preocupación la información publicada en medios de comunicación internacionales sobre los objetivos de la denominada red "ZunZuneo", que constituiría un uso ilícito de las nuevas tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones. 200. Por consiguiente, reiteramos nuestro compromiso de intensificar los esfuerzos internacionales dirigidos a salvaguardar el ciberespacio y promover su uso exclusivo para la consecución de fines pacíficos y como vehículo para contribuir al desarrollo económico y social, y resaltamos que la cooperación internacional, respetando plenamente los derechos humanos, es la única opción viable para fomentar los efectos positivos de las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones, evitar sus posibles efectos negativos, promover su uso con fines pacíficos y legítimos y garantizar que los avances científicos y tecnológicos tengan por objeto preservar la paz y promover el bienestar y el desarrollo de nuestras sociedades. Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio 201. Expresamos nuestro compromiso de intensificar los esfuerzos encaminados a alcanzar los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio antes de 2015 y de asumir un papel rector para dar forma a la agenda internacional para el desarrollo después de 2015. Exhortamos a la comunidad internacional a que redoble todos los esfuerzos para acelerar el cumplimiento de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio de aquí a 2015 mediante medidas concretas. 202. Observamos los progresos logrados hasta la fecha para alcanzar los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio, pero nos preocupan la desigualdad y las deficiencias en el logro y los enormes desafíos socioeconómicos y ambientales que persisten en los países en desarrollo. Reiteramos que los Objetivos siguen siendo fundamentales para atender las necesidades básicas de la población de los países en desarrollo, muchos de los cuales no están en condiciones de alcanzarlos para 2015. 203. Recalcamos el papel central que corresponde a la alianza mundial para el desarrollo y la importancia del octavo Objetivo de Desarrollo del Milenio para la consecución de todos los Objetivos, y que sin un apoyo internacional sustancial y cambios sistémicos, muchos países en desarrollo no lograrán alcanzar varios Objetivos para 2015. Exhortamos a la comunidad internacional a intensificar sus esfuerzos para que se proporcionen a los países en desarrollo mejores medios para progresar mediante una alianza mundial renovada basada en la búsqueda colectiva de medidas destinadas a erradicar la pobreza y las privaciones. Desarrollo sostenible y Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible 204. Recordamos y reafirmamos la aseveración que hicieron los dirigentes mundiales en el documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible, titulado "El futuro que queremos", de que la erradicación de la pobreza es el mayor problema que afronta el mundo en la actualidad y una condición indispensable del desarrollo sostenible. 205. Reiteramos que erradicar la pobreza, modificar las modalidades de consumo y producción insostenibles y promover modalidades sostenibles, y disponer la protección y la ordenación de la base de recursos naturales del desarrollo económico y social son objetivos generales y requisitos indispensables para el desarrollo sostenible. Reafirmamos también que es necesario lograr el desarrollo sostenible promoviendo un crecimiento sostenido, inclusivo y equitativo, creando mayores oportunidades para todos, reduciendo las desigualdades, mejorando los niveles de vida básicos, fomentando el desarrollo social equitativo y la inclusión, y promoviendo la ordenación integrada y sostenible de los recursos naturales y los ecosistemas, que contribuye, entre otras cosas, al desarrollo económico, social y humano y facilita al mismo tiempo la conservación, la regeneración, el restablecimiento y la resiliencia de los ecosistemas frente a los problemas nuevos y en ciernes. 206. Destacamos que los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible deberían abordar y centrarse prioritariamente en la integración de las tres dimensiones del desarrollo sostenible (económica, social y ambiental), regirse por el documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible, respetar todos los Principios de Río y tener en cuenta las diferentes circunstancias, capacidades y prioridades nacionales. 207. Reafirmamos que el documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible es la base de la labor del Grupo de Trabajo Abierto de la Asamblea General sobre los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible. Subrayamos que para avanzar en el logro del objetivo general de erradicar la pobreza es importante que los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible se basen en los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio y los complementen. 208. Destacamos que los avances en el cumplimiento de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio, los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible y la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 dependerán de la medida en que se cree un entorno internacional propicio que favorezca el desarrollo y se faciliten los medios de ejecución pertinentes a los países en desarrollo, en particular en las esferas de las finanzas, el comercio, la tecnología y la creación de capacidad. 209. Reafirmamos que los principios rectores del Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible deben basarse en todos los principios establecidos en las grandes cumbres y conferencias de las Naciones Unidas en las esferas económica, ambiental y social, teniendo en cuenta, entre otros, los enunciados en la Declaración de Río sobre el Medio Ambiente y el Desarrollo, el Programa 21 y el Plan de Aplicación de las Decisiones de la Cumbre Mundial sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible, y los derivados de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible (2012), la Conferencia Internacional sobre la Financiación para el Desarrollo (2002) y la Cumbre Mundial sobre Desarrollo Social (1995), y deben ajustarse al derecho internacional. El proceso y los resultados del Grupo de Trabajo Abierto de la Asamblea General sobre los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible deben respetar plenamente todos los Principios de Río, en particular el principio de la responsabilidad común pero diferenciada. Los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible deben contribuir a la plena aplicación de los resultados de todas las grandes cumbres en las esferas económica, social y ambiental. 210. Reafirmamos que reconocemos que el planeta Tierra y sus ecosistemas son nuestro hogar y que "Madre Tierra" es una expresión común en muchos países y regiones, y observamos que algunos países reconocen los derechos de la naturaleza en el contexto de la promoción del desarrollo sostenible. Estamos convencidos de que, para lograr un justo equilibrio entre las necesidades económicas, sociales y ambientales de las generaciones presentes y futuras, es necesario promover la armonía con la naturaleza. Pedimos que se adopte un enfoque holístico e integrado del desarrollo sostenible, que podría incluir, entre otras cosas, el reconocimiento por algunos países de los principios antes mencionados, que lleve a la humanidad a vivir en armonía con la naturaleza y que propicie la adopción de medidas para restablecer la salud y la integridad del ecosistema de la Tierra. 211. Acogemos con satisfacción el diálogo interactivo de la Asamblea General sobre la Armonía con la Naturaleza, celebrado el 22 de abril de 2013 con ocasión del Día Internacional de la Madre Tierra, en el que se examinaron diferentes enfoques económicos en el contexto del desarrollo sostenible a fin de promover una base más ética en la relación entre los seres humanos y la Tierra, así como la necesidad de fomentar el uso sostenible de los recursos naturales, teniendo en cuenta la importancia de estudiar la adopción y la aplicación de políticas que conformen estrategias nacionales de desarrollo que promuevan una mejor distribución de los beneficios y no se circunscriban a la mera producción de materias primas, de conformidad con lo dispuesto en la resolución 67/214 de la Asamblea General. 212. Recalcamos que el informe del Grupo de Trabajo Abierto de la Asamblea General sobre los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible debe ser el resultado de un proceso intergubernamental inclusivo. En consecuencia, reafirmamos nuestro compromiso de participar activamente en tales negociaciones. 213. Subrayamos la necesidad de definir medios de ejecución adecuados para todos y cada uno de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible, así como la necesidad de un objetivo de desarrollo sostenible dedicado expresamente al fortalecimiento de la alianza mundial para el desarrollo sostenible, con compromisos generales con respecto a los medios de ejecución y la cooperación internacional para el desarrollo sostenible. Agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 214. Reafirmamos la importancia fundamental de que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 se establezca en un proceso de negociación intergubernamental justo, transparente e inclusivo, según lo decidido en el acto especial de seguimiento de la labor realizada para lograr los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio celebrado en 2013. Destacamos que ese proceso de negociación intergubernamental deberá centrarse en sus modalidades y aspectos sustantivos de modo que se genere un documento final negociado y convenido que tenga plenamente en cuenta los resultados de los diversos procesos de seguimiento previstos por la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible y de las principales cumbres y conferencias relacionadas con los ámbitos social, económico y ambiental. 215. Recordando la afirmación hecha en la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible de que la erradicación de la pobreza es el mayor problema que afronta el mundo y una condición indispensable del desarrollo sostenible, hacemos hincapié en que la erradicación de la pobreza debe seguir siendo el objetivo central y conductor de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015. Estamos firmemente convencidos de que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 debe reforzar el compromiso de la comunidad internacional de erradicar la pobreza para 2030. 216. Subrayamos la necesidad de adoptar un enfoque coherente en lo que respecta a la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015, que refuerce el compromiso de la comunidad internacional de erradicar la pobreza e integrar las tres dimensiones del desarrollo sostenible de manera equilibrada, con la contribución del Grupo de Trabajo Abierto de la Asamblea General sobre los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible, el proceso de financiación para el desarrollo, el Comité Intergubernamental de Expertos en Financiación del Desarrollo Sostenible, el proceso para formular opciones con respecto a un mecanismo de las Naciones Unidas de facilitación de la tecnología y otros procesos pertinentes. 217. Reafirmamos que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 debe ajustarse plenamente a los Principios de Río, en particular al principio de la responsabilidad común pero diferenciada. 218. Subrayamos la importancia de fortalecer la alianza mundial para el desarrollo, que se ha de basar en objetivos cuantificados con plazos concretos, en consonancia con el octavo Objetivo de Desarrollo del Milenio y de conformidad con el principio de la responsabilidad común pero diferenciada en el marco de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015. La piedra angular de esta alianza sigue siendo la cooperación Norte-Sur, de la que la cooperación Sur-Sur y la cooperación triangular son un complemento útil. En consecuencia, los países desarrollados han de reafirmar su compromiso de intensificar la cooperación internacional y prestar un mayor apoyo a los países en desarrollo. Hacemos hincapié en la necesidad de que los países desarrollados cumplan urgentemente los compromisos de asistencia oficial para el desarrollo que han contraído de manera individual y colectiva, en particular la meta de destinar el 0,7% de su producto nacional bruto a la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo para el año 2015 y la meta de destinar entre el 0,15% y el 0,20% de su producto nacional bruto a la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo de los países menos adelantados. 219. Hacemos hincapié en que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 debe abordar de manera sustantiva cuestiones relativas a la reforma de las instituciones de gobernanza económica mundial a fin de dar mayor voz y participación a los países en desarrollo en la adopción de decisiones en esas instituciones. Observamos también que los sistemas económicos, financieros y comerciales mundiales siguen estando desequilibrados, en detrimento de los países en desarrollo, y a este respecto destacamos la importancia de indicar, en la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015, las deficiencias y los desequilibrios de esos sistemas mundiales y de proponer medidas para mejorarlos con objeto de favorecer la agenda y los programas de desarrollo de los países en desarrollo. 220. Afirmamos la necesidad de un mecanismo sólido de aplicación de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 que asegure la disponibilidad de recursos para el desarrollo para lograr los objetivos fijados. En este sentido, pedimos que se intensifique la financiación para el desarrollo, se establezcan y mejoren mecanismos de transferencia de tecnología y se potencien iniciativas para desarrollar la capacidad de los países en desarrollo. 221. Pedimos que se adopte un enfoque de rendición de cuentas responsable con respecto a las alianzas de las que formen parte las Naciones Unidas, en particular en lo referente a la participación del sector privado, la sociedad civil y entidades filantrópicas. A este respecto, reafirmamos que es preciso aumentar la transparencia, la coherencia y la sostenibilidad, así como la rendición de cuentas a los Estados Miembros en las alianzas de las Naciones Unidas, y destacamos la necesidad de que haya establecidos procedimientos para que los Estados Miembros examinen y aprueben este tipo de iniciativas en la Asamblea General a fin de preservar el carácter intergubernamental de las Naciones Unidas. 222. Hacemos hincapié en que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 debe ser una agenda para el desarrollo y en que, en este contexto, es importante promover el desarrollo económico, social y ambiental de manera integral, equilibrada y coordinada. Esta agenda debe tener un mayor alcance que los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio y abarcar las esferas, las cuestiones y los grupos de población que son fundamentales para lograr el desarrollo sostenible. 223. Destacamos también la importancia de que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015, si se pretende que sea de carácter global y universalmente aplicable a todos, respete plenamente el margen normativo en materia de desarrollo de los países en desarrollo, de forma que puedan recurrir a las medidas y los instrumentos normativos necesarios para poner en práctica sus políticas de erradicación de la pobreza y otros planes y programas de desarrollo. Destacamos también que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 debe promover el crecimiento económico rápido, sostenido e inclusivo en los países en desarrollo como requisito fundamental para erradicar la pobreza y el hambre y reducir las desigualdades dentro de los países y de un país a otro. Parte V Necesidades particulares de los países en desarrollo en situaciones especiales 224. Recordamos las necesidades especiales de África, único continente que no va camino de alcanzar los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente, incluidos los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio. Reconocemos que, si bien se está reanudando el crecimiento económico, es necesario apuntalar la recuperación, que es frágil y desigual, para hacer frente a los actuales efectos adversos de las múltiples crisis en el desarrollo y a las graves dificultades que suponen para la lucha contra la pobreza y el hambre, que podrían comprometer aún más el logro en África de los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente, incluidos los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio. 225. Expresamos profunda preocupación por el hecho de que no se ha cumplido plenamente el compromiso de duplicar la ayuda a África antes de 2010 formulado en la cumbre del Grupo de los Ocho celebrada en Gleneagles (Reino Unido) y, a este respecto, recalcamos la necesidad de avanzar con rapidez en el cumplimiento de esos compromisos y los asumidos por otros donantes de aumentar la ayuda a los países africanos por medios diversos, entre ellos la aportación de nuevos recursos adicionales, la transferencia de tecnología y la creación de capacidad, y de contribuir a su desarrollo sostenible. Pedimos que se siga prestando apoyo a las iniciativas de desarrollo de África, como la Agenda 2063 (plan estratégico y marco de prioridades para el desarrollo socioeconómico a escala continental), la Nueva Alianza para el Desarrollo de África y el Programa de Desarrollo de la Infraestructura en África. Por otro lado, acogemos con satisfacción el apoyo prestado a África por algunos países en desarrollo mediante programas de cooperación Sur-Sur y cooperación triangular. 226. Manifestamos preocupación ante la situación de los países menos adelantados, que sigue deteriorándose como consecuencia de las múltiples crisis mundiales actuales, que se exacerban mutuamente. Es evidente que la actual crisis financiera y económica mundial está socavando el desarrollo en los países menos adelantados. Como consecuencia del retroceso en los modestos avances en materia de desarrollo conseguidos a lo largo de los años por estos países, está aumentando el número de personas abocadas a la pobreza extrema en su territorio. Muchos países menos adelantados siguen estando lejos de alcanzar los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente, incluidos los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio. Hacemos hincapié en la necesidad de llevar a la práctica de forma plena y efectiva los compromisos asumidos en el Programa de Acción en Favor de los Países Menos Adelantados para el Decenio 2011-2020. Subrayamos además la necesidad vital de hacer efectiva rápidamente una alianza mundial renovada y fortalecida para los países menos adelantados a fin de superar sus problemas estructurales, erradicar la pobreza, alcanzar los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente y ayudar a la mitad de los países menos adelantados a cumplir los criterios que les permitan salir de esa categoría para 2020. 227. Recordamos que las vulnerabilidades específicas y particulares de los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo han sido reconocidas por la comunidad internacional en varias reuniones de las Naciones Unidas, como por ejemplo las celebradas en Río de Janeiro (1992), Barbados (1994), Johannesburgo (2002) y Mauricio (2005), y señalamos con preocupación que no se han tomado suficientes medidas a nivel internacional para subsanar esas vulnerabilidades y apoyar con eficacia los esfuerzos de dichos Estados en pro del desarrollo sostenible. Recordamos que el cambio climático y la elevación del nivel del mar constituyen la mayor amenaza para la supervivencia y la viabilidad de los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo y para sus esfuerzos por lograr los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible, y hacemos un llamamiento a la comunidad internacional a que se comprometa a aumentar con carácter urgente la cooperación internacional en apoyo de dichos esfuerzos, en particular mediante el incremento de recursos financieros, el fomento de la capacidad, la transferencia de tecnología y conocimientos especializados, y una mayor participación de los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo en la toma de decisiones económicas a nivel internacional. Acogemos con beneplácito la decisión de convocar la tercera Conferencia Internacional sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible de los Pequeños Estados Insulares en Desarrollo, que se celebrará en 2014 en Apia, y pedimos que se aumenten las medidas de asistencia a los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo en la aplicación del Programa de Acción para el desarrollo sostenible de los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo y la Estrategia de Mauricio para la Ejecución del Programa de Acción para el desarrollo sostenible de los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo. Nos comprometemos a trabajar en pro de un resultado sólido para la Conferencia de Apia que sirva de apoyo a los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo en sus necesidades y aspiraciones en materia de desarrollo sostenible. 228. Reconocemos las necesidades y los desafíos especiales que afrontan los países en desarrollo sin litoral, causados por su falta de acceso territorial al mar, situación agravada por la lejanía de los mercados mundiales, y expresamos también nuestra preocupación por el hecho de que el crecimiento económico y el bienestar social de los países en desarrollo sin litoral siguen siendo muy vulnerables a las perturbaciones externas así como a los múltiples desafíos que enfrenta la comunidad internacional, como la crisis financiera y económica y los cambios climáticos. Hacemos hincapié en la necesidad de que la comunidad internacional aumente la asistencia para el desarrollo a los países en desarrollo sin litoral para ayudarles a subsanar sus vulnerabilidades, aumentar la resiliencia y adoptar una senda de desarrollo social y económico sostenible. Reafirmamos la necesidad de atender sin dilación las necesidades especiales de desarrollo y los desafíos que enfrentan los países en desarrollo sin litoral y de tránsito a través de su asociación genuina con el apoyo y cooperación suficientes de la comunidad internacional para la eficaz aplicación de las prioridades del Programa de Acción de Almaty y su programa sucesor. Acogemos con beneplácito la decisión de la Asamblea General de celebrar una conferencia de examen global decenal del Programa de Acción de Almaty en 2014 y exhortamos a la comunidad internacional a considerar con espíritu crítico las necesidades y los desafíos especiales que afrontan los países en desarrollo sin litoral y ayudar a establecer las prioridades de un marco más integrado y orientado hacia la acción común en favor de los países en desarrollo sin litoral para el próximo decenio. 229. Reconocemos que los países de ingresos medianos siguen afrontando importantes desafíos en materia de desarrollo y subrayamos que, a pesar de los recientes progresos logrados y los esfuerzos realizados por los países de ingresos medianos, el 75% de los pobres del mundo vive en esos países. La consecución de los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente, incluidos los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio, así como el logro del pleno empleo y la creación de puestos de trabajo para los jóvenes, la diversificación de sus economías y el desarrollo de las tecnologías siguen planteando enormes dificultades para los países de ingresos medianos. Hacemos hincapié en la creciente solidaridad y el papel desempeñado por los países de ingresos medianos en el ámbito de la cooperación Sur-Sur en apoyo de las iniciativas de desarrollo de otros países en desarrollo. Observamos también los resultados de la conferencia de alto nivel de los países de ingresos medianos, organizada por Costa Rica y la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo Industrial en junio de 2013. 230. Subrayamos la necesidad de que el sistema de las Naciones Unidas para el desarrollo se asegure de que aborda las distintas necesidades de los países de ingresos medianos en materia de desarrollo de una forma coordinada por medios como una evaluación precisa de las prioridades y necesidades nacionales de esos países, teniendo en cuenta la utilización de variables que vayan más allá de los criterios relativos a los ingresos per capita y reconociendo la naturaleza multidimensional del desarrollo y de la pobreza y a través de un apoyo adecuado, sistemático y mejor enfocado, de conformidad con los planes nacionales. 231. Reiteramos nuestro llamamiento para que Israel, la Potencia ocupante, se retire total e inmediatamente del Territorio Palestino Ocupado, incluida Jerusalén Oriental, y del Golán sirio ocupado hasta la línea existente el 4 de junio de 1967, así como del resto de territorios ocupados del Líbano. Reafirmamos nuestro apoyo a un proceso de paz en el Oriente Medio orientado a lograr una paz amplia, justa y duradera en la región, de conformidad con las resoluciones pertinentes de las Naciones Unidas, entre ellas las resoluciones del Consejo de Seguridad 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 425 (1978) y 1850 (2008) y el principio de territorio por paz. En este contexto, también reafirmamos nuestro apoyo a la Iniciativa de Paz Árabe, aprobada por el Consejo de la Liga de los Estados Árabes en marzo de 2002. 232. Hacemos hincapié en la necesidad de la pronta realización por el pueblo palestino de su derecho a la libre determinación y a la independencia de su Estado de Palestina a fin de hacer posible la estabilidad, la prosperidad y el desarrollo en pro de la consecución de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio (ODM), a los que tienen derecho todos los pueblos. Expresamos nuestro apoyo a los esfuerzos del pueblo palestino por lograr la independencia y, a ese respecto, celebramos el hecho de que el 23 de septiembre de 2011 el Estado de Palestina presentara la solicitud de ingresar en las Naciones Unidas como miembro de pleno derecho, y observamos la aprobación por la Asamblea General de la resolución 67/19, de 29 de noviembre de 2012, en que concedió a Palestina la condición de Estado observador no miembro en las Naciones Unidas. Seguimos prestando apoyo al proceso de admisión del Estado de Palestina como miembro de pleno derecho de las Naciones Unidas lo antes posible. Recordamos que 2014 fue declarado Año Internacional de Solidaridad con el Pueblo Palestino. 233. Condenamos la continuación de la ocupación militar israelí del territorio palestino, incluida Jerusalén Oriental, y las actividades ilegales que lleva a cabo la Potencia ocupante, que siguen provocando víctimas civiles, penurias socioeconómicas y humanitarias y destrucción de bienes, infraestructura y tierras agrícolas palestinos, y socavan la contigüidad, la unidad y la integridad del territorio. 234. Expresamos nuestra profunda preocupación por el empeoramiento de las condiciones sociales y económicas del pueblo palestino, particularmente en la Franja de Gaza asediada, como consecuencia de las prácticas ilegales de Israel, como la construcción de asentamientos y del muro y la imposición de un bloqueo y de cientos de puestos de control. Exhortamos a Israel, la Potencia ocupante, a que cese de inmediato todas las medidas ilegales que obstaculizan la economía y el desarrollo de Palestina, en particular, el bloqueo inhumano e ilegal impuesto a la Franja de Gaza y las restricciones impuestas a la circulación de personas y bienes, incluido el comercio en todo el Territorio Palestino Ocupado, con destino a él y desde él, y a que pague indemnizaciones por todos los daños causados a las propiedades, instituciones e infraestructura palestinas. Reiteramos nuestro llamamiento a la comunidad internacional para que durante este período crítico siga prestando al pueblo palestino la asistencia humanitaria y para el desarrollo que tanto se necesitan, especialmente para las labores de reconstrucción y la recuperación económica en la Franja de Gaza. 235. Reafirmamos los derechos inalienables del pueblo palestino y de la población del Golán sirio ocupado sobre sus recursos naturales, incluidos la tierra, el agua y los recursos energéticos, y exigimos que Israel, la Potencia ocupante, deje de explotar, dañar, destruir, agotar y poner en peligro los recursos naturales del Territorio Palestino Ocupado, incluida Jerusalén Oriental, y el Golán sirio ocupado. 236. Reafirmamos la necesidad de que los Gobiernos de la Argentina y del Reino Unido reanuden sus negociaciones de conformidad con los principios y los objetivos de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y las resoluciones pertinentes de la Asamblea General, a fin de encontrar a la mayor brevedad posible una solución pacífica a la disputa de soberanía relacionada con la cuestión de las Islas Malvinas, que perjudica gravemente la capacidad económica de la Argentina, y la necesidad de que ambas partes se abstengan de tomar decisiones que entrañarían la introducción de modificaciones unilaterales de la situación mientras las islas se encuentran en medio del proceso recomendado por la Asamblea General. 237. Reafirmamos la necesidad de encontrar una solución pacífica a las cuestiones de soberanía que afrontan los países en desarrollo, entre otras la disputa relativa al archipiélago de Chagos, incluida la isla Diego García, que el Reino Unido arrancó ilegalmente del territorio de Mauricio antes de su independencia, en violación del derecho internacional y de las resoluciones 1514 (XV), de 14 de diciembre de 1960, y 2066 (XX), de 16 de diciembre de 1965, de la Asamblea General. De no resolverse estas cuestiones en materia de descolonización y soberanía, el desarrollo y las capacidades y perspectivas económicas de los países en desarrollo se verían gravemente perjudicados y menoscabados. A este respecto, pese a la firme oposición de Mauricio, el Reino Unido pretendió establecer una "zona marina protegida" alrededor del archipiélago de Chagos, lo que vulnera el derecho internacional y dificulta aun más el ejercicio por parte de Mauricio de sus derechos soberanos sobre el archipiélago y el derecho de los ciudadanos mauricios que fueron desplazados a la fuerza por el Reino Unido a volver al archipiélago. 238. Tomamos nota de la Declaración de la Habana, aprobada en la II Cumbre de la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños, celebrada los días 28 y 29 de enero de 2014. 239. Reafirmamos nuestro firme rechazo a la imposición de leyes y reglamentos con un efecto extraterritorial y todas las demás formas de medidas económicas coercitivas, incluidas las sanciones unilaterales contra países en desarrollo, y reiteramos la urgente necesidad de eliminarlos inmediatamente. Recalcamos que esas medidas no solo socavan los principios consagrados en la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y el derecho internacional, sino que además constituyen una grave amenaza para la libertad de comercio e inversión. Por consiguiente, instamos a la comunidad internacional a que adopte medidas urgentes y eficaces para impedir la aplicación de medidas económicas coercitivas unilaterales en contra de los países en desarrollo. 240. Expresamos nuestro rechazo a las listas y certificaciones unilaterales por parte de países desarrollados y que afectan a los países en desarrollo, en particular las referidas a terrorismo, narcotráfico, trata de personas y otras de similar carácter. 241. Reiteramos nuestro llamamiento al Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América, formulado en la segunda Cumbre del Sur, organizada por el Grupo de los 77 y China y celebrada en Doha en 2005, a que ponga fin al embargo económico, comercial y financiero contra Cuba que, además de ser unilateral y contrario a la Carta de las Naciones Unidas, al derecho internacional, así como al principio de vecindad, causa grandes pérdidas materiales y daños económicos al pueblo de Cuba. Instamos al estricto cumplimiento de las resoluciones de la Asamblea General acerca de este asunto. También tomamos nota que en la Declaración de La Habana los Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno de la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños reafirmaron su más profundo rechazo a la aplicación de medidas coercitivas unilaterales y reiteraron una vez más su solidaridad con Cuba, al tiempo que reafirmaron su llamamiento al Gobierno de los Estados Unidos a que pusiera fin al bloqueo económico, comercial y financiero que impone a dicha nación hermana desde hace más de cinco décadas. Rechazaron la inclusión de Cuba en la denominada lista de Estados que promueven el terrorismo publicada por el Departamento de Estado de los Estados Unidos y solicitaron que se pusiera fin a esa práctica unilateral. 242. Reafirmamos nuestro rechazo a las sanciones económicas unilaterales impuestas contra el Sudán, que tienen efectos negativos sobre el desarrollo y la prosperidad del Sudán, y a este respecto pedimos el levantamiento inmediato de dichas sanciones.
Parte I
Contexto general 1. Nosotros, Jefas y Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno de los Estados miembros del Grupo de los 77 y China, nos hemos reunido en la ciudad de Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, para conmemorar el cincuentenario de la creación del Grupo. 2. Conmemoramos la formación del Grupo de los 77 el 15 de junio de 1964 y recordamos los ideales y principios contenidos en la histórica Declaración Conjunta de los Setenta y Siete Países en Desarrollo, firmada al final del primer período de sesiones de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre Comercio y Desarrollo (UNCTAD), celebrada en Ginebra. 3. Recordamos que, en su primera declaración, el Grupo de los 77 se comprometió a promover la igualdad en el orden económico y social internacional y a promover los intereses del mundo en desarrollo, declaró su unidad en el marco de un interés común y definió al Grupo como instrumento para ampliar el ámbito de la cooperación en la esfera internacional y para asegurar relaciones mutuamente benéficas con el resto del mundo. 4. Recordamos también la primera Reunión Ministerial del Grupo de los 77 celebrada en Argel del 10 al 25 de octubre de 1964, en la que el Grupo aprobó la Carta de Argel, que estableció los principios de unidad, complementariedad, cooperación y solidaridad de los países en desarrollo y su determinación de esforzarse por lograr el desarrollo económico y social, individual o colectivamente. 5. Ponemos de relieve que el Grupo de los 77 ha proporcionado los medios para que los países del Sur articulen y promuevan sus intereses económicos y sociales, ha mejorado su capacidad de negociación en el sistema de las Naciones Unidas, y observamos con satisfacción que el Grupo ha establecido una secretaría permanente en la Sede de las Naciones Unidas en Nueva York y capítulos en Ginebra, Nairobi, París, Roma, Viena y el Grupo de los 24 en Washington D.C., y que lo integran actualmente 133 Estados miembros. 6. Recordamos también el éxito de la primera Cumbre del Sur del Grupo de los 77 y China, celebrada en La Habana en abril de 2000, y de la segunda Cumbre del Sur, celebrada en Doha en junio de 2005, que elevaron la condición del Grupo de los 77 y China a nivel de Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno, y en las que se adoptaron importantes declaraciones y planes de acción que han guiado nuestro Grupo y constituyen la base fundamental para la construcción de un nuevo orden mundial y una agenda propia de los países del Sur para la creación de un sistema más justo, democrático y equitativo que beneficie a nuestros pueblos. 7. Nos comprometemos a continuar la tradición de nuestros países de consolidar el desarrollo nacional y unirnos en el plano internacional, en aras del establecimiento de un orden internacional justo en la economía mundial que ayude a los países en desarrollo a alcanzar nuestros objetivos de crecimiento económico sostenido, pleno empleo, equidad social, suministro de bienes y servicios básicos a nuestro pueblo, protección del medio ambiente y vida en armonía con la naturaleza. 8. Nos enorgullecen el legado y los grandes logros del Grupo de los 77 y China en la defensa y la promoción de los intereses de los países en desarrollo en los últimos 50 años, que han contribuido poco a poco a incrementar su peso e influencia en las cuestiones económicas, sociales y ambientales. Nos comprometemos a consolidar esa base y seguir construyendo un orden mundial que sea justo, equitativo, estable y pacífico. Entre otros hitos importantes en ese sentido cabe mencionar la aprobación por la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas de la Declaración sobre el Establecimiento del Nuevo Orden Económico Internacional de 1974, la Declaración sobre el Derecho al Desarrollo en 1986, y varias otras declaraciones históricas que reconocen las necesidades y los intereses de los países en desarrollo y responden a ellos, y constituyen una de sus prioridades máximas. 9. Creemos en el arreglo pacífico de las controversias mediante el diálogo. 10. También observamos que, a pesar de cinco decenios de logros, aún existen graves deficiencias en el cumplimiento de los objetivos de nuestro grupo, y que nuestros países, individual y colectivamente, se enfrentan a desafíos emergentes y que continúan, como la desaceleración de la economía mundial y sus efectos en nuestros países, y la falta de medidas sistémicas y mecanismos de rendición de cuentas adecuados para abordar las causas y los efectos de las crisis financiera y económica mundial, que plantea el consiguiente riesgo de que se mantenga el patrón de los ciclos de crisis. 11. También tomamos nota de las limitaciones existentes en muchos de nuestros países a la hora de satisfacer las necesidades de empleo, alimentos, agua, atención de la salud, educación, vivienda, infraestructura física y energía de nuestro pueblo, así como la inminente crisis del medio ambiente, que acarrea los efectos negativos del cambio climático en los países en desarrollo, la escasez cada vez mayor de agua potable y la pérdida de diversidad biológica. 12. Destacamos que los desequilibrios de la economía mundial y la desigualdad de las estructuras y los resultados de los sistemas comercial, financiero, monetario y tecnológico dieron lugar a la creación de nuestro Grupo. No obstante, esos desequilibrios persisten hoy en algunos aspectos incluso con más efectos adversos en los países en desarrollo. Por lo tanto, nos comprometemos a continuar e intensificar nuestros esfuerzos para tratar de establecer un orden internacional imparcial, justo y equitativo, orientado a satisfacer las necesidades de desarrollo de los países en desarrollo. 13. Ponemos de relieve que las razones para el establecimiento de nuestro Grupo hace 50 años siguen siendo reales y válidas, incluso más válidas que en ese momento. Por lo tanto, volvemos a comprometernos y a comprometer a nuestros países a fortalecer y ampliar los esfuerzos incansables del Grupo de los 77 y China en todos los ámbitos en pro de un mayor progreso y del mejoramiento de las condiciones de vida de nuestro pueblo. 14. Afirmamos que el siglo XXI es el momento para que los Países y los Pueblos del Sur desarrollen sus economías y sociedades a fin de cumplir las necesidades humanas de manera sostenible, en armonía con la naturaleza y respetando a la Madre Tierra y sus ecosistemas. Convenimos en consolidar nuestros valores tradicionales y las prácticas de solidaridad y colaboración en beneficio mutuo y la fortaleza de nuestro pueblo, a fin de lograr progresos en nuestros países y en la cooperación Sur-Sur. 15. Hacemos hincapié en que nuestras principales prioridades son promover un crecimiento económico sostenido, inclusivo y equitativo, crear mayores oportunidades para todos, reducir las desigualdades, mejorar los niveles de vida básicos; fomentar el desarrollo social equitativo y la inclusión; y promover una ordenación integrada y sostenible de los recursos naturales y los ecosistemas que preste apoyo, entre otras cosas, al desarrollo económico, social y humano, facilitando al mismo tiempo la conservación, la regeneración, el restablecimiento y la resiliencia del ecosistema frente a los desafíos nuevos y emergentes. 16. Reafirmamos que los puntos más fuertes del Grupo de los 77 han sido su unidad y solidaridad, su visión de las relaciones multilaterales justas y equitativas, el compromiso de sus Estados miembros con el bienestar de los pueblos del Sur y su empeño en promover una cooperación mutuamente beneficiosa. 17. Hacemos hincapié en que cada país tiene el derecho soberano de decidir sus propias prioridades y estrategias de desarrollo, teniendo presente que no hay una fórmula que sirva para todos. Ponemos de relieve la necesidad de que las normas internacionales permitan que los países en desarrollo dispongan de espacio y flexibilidad en cuanto a las políticas, ya que dichas normas están directamente relacionadas con las estrategias de desarrollo de los gobiernos nacionales. Ponemos de relieve también la necesidad de que haya espacio político para que nuestros países puedan formular estrategias de desarrollo que expresen intereses nacionales y distintas necesidades que no siempre se tienen presentes al formular políticas económicas internacionales en el proceso de integración con la economía mundial. 18. Nos preocupa la situación actual de la economía mundial y el estado de la gobernanza económica mundial y la necesidad de una enérgica recuperación. Creemos que el mundo se enfrenta a la peor crisis financiera y económica desde la Gran Depresión, y nos alarman los efectos adversos que está teniendo esta crisis sobre todo en los países en desarrollo. Creemos que la crisis ha puesto de relieve puntos débiles y desequilibrios sistémicos de larga data de la economía mundial, y ha puesto más de manifiesto la insuficiencia y el carácter antidemocrático de la gobernanza económica mundial. Deben hacerse ahora nuevos intentos para establecer un sistema adecuado de gobernanza económica mundial, con la plena expresión, representación y participación de los países en desarrollo en los debates y la adopción de decisiones. 19. Reconocemos la gran importancia de mantener la protección social y fomentar la creación de empleo, incluso en tiempos de crisis económica, y tomamos nota con satisfacción de los ejemplos alentadores de políticas que han permitido a los países reducir la pobreza, aumentar la inclusión social y crear nuevos y mejores empleos en los últimos años. 20. Nos preocupa el aumento de la concentración de la riqueza y los ingresos en el mundo y su distribución asimétrica, que han creado grandes desigualdades entre los países desarrollados y los países en desarrollo. Este grado de desigualdad es injustificable y no puede tolerarse en un mundo donde la pobreza sigue prevaleciendo, los recursos se están agotando y la degradación del medio ambiente es cada vez mayor. Pedimos que se adopten medidas a escala mundial para reducir las desigualdades a todos los niveles. También nos comprometemos a hacer frente a la desigualdad en nuestros propios países. 21. Tomamos nota con preocupación de la influencia de las grandes empresas, principalmente de los países desarrollados, en la economía mundial, y sus efectos negativos en el desarrollo social, económico y ambiental de algunos países en desarrollo, en particular en lo que respecta a los obstáculos que esa influencia pueda plantear al ingreso de nuevas empresas en el mercado mundial. En ese sentido, pedimos que la comunidad internacional adopte medidas concretas para hacer frente a esos efectos negativos y promover la competencia internacional y un mayor acceso a los mercados para los países en desarrollo, en particular políticas que promuevan el crecimiento de las pequeñas y medianas empresas en los países en desarrollo, la eliminación de las barreras comerciales que impiden la adición de valor en los países de origen, como las crestas arancelarias y la progresividad arancelaria, así como el fomento de la capacidad en materia de derecho de la competencia, la regulación de la política tributaria y la responsabilidad social de las empresas. 22. Ponemos de relieve que las empresas transnacionales tienen la responsabilidad de respetar todos los derechos humanos y deberían abstenerse de causar desastres medioambientales y afectar al bienestar de los pueblos. 23. Reconocemos los progresos logrados en el desarrollo sostenible a nivel regional, nacional, subnacional y local, y reafirmamos la importancia de apoyar a los países en desarrollo en sus esfuerzos por erradicar la pobreza mediante el empoderamiento de los pobres y las personas en situación vulnerable, promoviendo el desarrollo de la agricultura sostenible, así como el empleo pleno y productivo y el trabajo decente para todos, complementados por políticas sociales eficaces, incluidos niveles mínimos de protección social. 24. Respetamos plenamente los principios y propósitos de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y del derecho internacional, sobre todo en cuanto se refiere a la igualdad entre los Estados, el respeto de la independencia de los Estados, la soberanía nacional, la integridad territorial y la no injerencia en los asuntos internos de los Estados, y destacamos que dichos propósitos y principios inspiran nuestra plena adhesión al multilateralismo y dedicación a la búsqueda de un sistema económico internacional más justo y equitativo, que ofrezca oportunidades para elevar el nivel de vida de nuestros pueblos. 25. Somos profundamente conscientes de que decenios después de haber alcanzado la independencia política, algunos países en desarrollo siguen en las garras de la dependencia económica de las estructuras y los caprichos de la economía mundial y de los países desarrollados y sus entidades económicas. Esa dependencia, especialmente por parte de los países pobres y vulnerables, limita el alcance de nuestra verdadera independencia política también. Por lo tanto, nos comprometemos a aunar los esfuerzos encaminados a seguir tratando de alcanzar la independencia económica, y a reunirnos bajo la égida del Grupo de los 77 y China, así como de otras organizaciones del Sur, a fin de lograr avances a ese respecto. 26. Recordamos las decisiones adoptadas en la segunda Cumbre del Sur, celebrada en Doha en 2005, de cerciorarnos de que en las políticas y los programas concebidos en el contexto de la globalización se respeten plenamente los principios y propósitos de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y del derecho internacional, sobre todo en cuanto se refiere a la igualdad entre los Estados, el respeto de la independencia de los Estados, la soberanía nacional, la integridad territorial y la no injerencia en los asuntos internos de los Estados, y de destacar que dichos propósitos y principios inspiran nuestra plena adhesión al multilateralismo y dedicación a la búsqueda de un sistema económico internacional más justo y equitativo, que ofrezca oportunidades para elevar el nivel de vida de nuestros pueblos. 27. También recordamos la decisión adoptada en la Cumbre del Grupo de los 77 y China celebrada en Doha en 2005 de colaborar para la realización del derecho a la libre determinación de los pueblos que vivían bajo dominación colonial u otras formas de dominación u ocupación extranjera, lo que repercutía negativamente en su desarrollo social y económico, y de exhortar a la comunidad internacional a que adoptara todas las medidas necesarias para poner fin a la continuación de la ocupación extranjera, de acuerdo con los propósitos y principios de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y del derecho internacional. 28. Reafirmamos que los pueblos indígenas tienen derecho a conservar y reforzar sus propias instituciones políticas, jurídicas, económicas, sociales y culturales, manteniendo a la vez su derecho a participar plenamente, si lo desean, en la vida política, económica, social y cultural del Estado. A este respecto, ponemos de relieve la necesidad de respetar y salvaguardar las identidades culturales, los conocimientos y las tradiciones indígenas de nuestros países.
Parte II
Desarrollo en el contexto nacional
Estrategias de desarrollo sostenible 29. Hacemos hincapié en la necesidad de incorporar aún más el desarrollo sostenible en todos los niveles, integrando los aspectos económicos, sociales y ambientales y reconociendo los vínculos que existen entre ellos, a fin de lograr el desarrollo sostenible en todas sus dimensiones. 30. Reafirmamos que cada país dispone de diferentes enfoques, visiones, modelos e instrumentos, en función de sus circunstancias y prioridades nacionales, para lograr el desarrollo sostenible en sus tres dimensiones, que es nuestro objetivo general (Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible). En algunos países existe el enfoque del "Vivir bien" con un desarrollo integral encaminado a alcanzar las necesidades materiales, culturales y espirituales de las sociedades en el contexto de la Armonía con la Naturaleza. 31. Reconocemos que la Tierra y sus ecosistemas son nuestro hogar y estamos convencidos de que, para alcanzar un justo equilibrio entre las necesidades económicas, sociales y ambientales de las generaciones presentes y futuras, es necesario promover la armonía con la naturaleza y la Tierra. También reconocemos que "Madre Tierra" es una expresión común utilizada para referirse al planeta Tierra en diversos países y regiones, lo que demuestra la interdependencia existente entre los seres humanos, las demás especies vivas y el planeta que todos habitamos. 32. Acogemos con beneplácito que en 2011 se celebrara el vigésimo quinto aniversario de la Declaración sobre el Derecho al Desarrollo, que es un importante documento histórico que establece el derecho de los países en desarrollo a actuar con miras a lograr el desarrollo y el derecho de los pueblos a participar en el desarrollo y beneficiarse de él. 33. En este contexto, reafirmamos que el desarrollo es un proceso global económico, social, cultural y político de carácter global que tiende al mejoramiento constante del bienestar de la población en general y de todos los individuos sobre la base de su participación activa, libre y significativa en el desarrollo y en la distribución justa de los beneficios que de él se derivan, como se reconoce en la Declaración sobre el Derecho al Desarrollo. 34. También reafirmamos la proclamación de la Declaración sobre el Derecho al Desarrollo de que el derecho al desarrollo es un derecho humano inalienable en virtud del cual todas las personas y todos los pueblos están facultados para participar en un desarrollo económico, social, cultural y político en el que puedan realizarse plenamente todos los derechos humanos y libertades fundamentales para contribuir a ese desarrollo y para disfrutar del él, como se reconoce en la Declaración. Mejoramiento de las prácticas de la democracia 35. Consideramos que la democracia es un valor universal basado en la voluntad libremente expresada de los pueblos de determinar sus propios sistemas políticos, económicos, sociales y culturales y participar plenamente en todos los aspectos de la vida. Reafirmamos que, si bien todas las democracias tienen características comunes, no existe un modelo único de democracia, y que la democracia no pertenece a ningún país o región, y reafirmamos además la necesidad de respetar debidamente la soberanía, la unidad y la integridad territorial y el derecho a la libre determinación, así como el rechazo de cualquier intento de desestabilizar los sistemas constitucionales y democráticos legítimamente establecidos por los pueblos. 36. Pedimos que los medios de comunicación dejen de utilizarse de modo que puedan difundir información distorsionada contra los Estados miembros del Grupo de los 77 haciendo caso omiso del principio del derecho internacional. 37. Expresamos nuestra profunda indignación y desaprobación por los hechos relacionados con el retiro sorpresivo de permisos de sobrevuelo y aterrizaje del avión presidencial en que viajaban el Presidente del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, Sr. Evo Morales Ayma, y su grupo el 2 de julio de 2013. Estos hechos constituyen actos hostiles e injustificables que además pusieron en grave riesgo la seguridad del Presidente Morales. Hacemos pública nuestra máxima solidaridad y exigimos que se aclaren los hechos. Soberanía nacional sobre los recursos naturales y beneficios de esos recursos 38. Afirmamos que los Estados tienen, de conformidad con la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y los principios del derecho internacional, el derecho soberano de aprovechar sus propios recursos según sus propias políticas ambientales y de desarrollo, y la responsabilidad de velar por que las actividades realizadas dentro de su jurisdicción o bajo su control no causen daños al medio ambiente de otros Estados o de zonas que estén fuera de los límites de la jurisdicción nacional. 39. Reafirmamos también que el derecho de los pueblos y de las naciones a la soberanía permanente sobre sus riquezas y recursos naturales debe ejercerse en interés del desarrollo nacional y del bienestar del pueblo del respectivo Estado. 40. Si bien hacemos hincapié en la soberanía de nuestros países y pueblos sobre sus recursos naturales, somos conscientes de que tenemos el deber de conservar, gestionar y utilizar esos recursos de manera sostenible, y de crear condiciones para que la Naturaleza y los ecosistemas puedan regenerarse, en beneficio de las generaciones presentes y futuras. También reconocemos que el uso sostenible de los recursos naturales es un medio eficaz de lograr el crecimiento económico y reducir la pobreza y la degradación del medio ambiente. 41. Tomamos nota de las decisiones adoptadas por algunos países para nacionalizar o recuperar el control de sus recursos naturales con el fin de obtener mayores beneficios para sus pueblos, en particular para las personas pobres, y para invertir en la diversificación económica, la industrialización y los programas sociales, y respetamos esas decisiones. 42. Instamos a que se proporcione asistencia técnica y para el fomento de la capacidad a los países en desarrollo a nivel internacional, regional y nacional, a fin de ayudarlos a obtener los máximos beneficios de la extracción y utilización de los recursos en consonancia con el desarrollo sostenible, teniendo en cuenta el pleno ejercicio del derecho soberano de nuestros países sobre sus recursos naturales. Erradicación de la pobreza 43. Reconocemos que la pobreza es una afrenta a la dignidad humana y destacamos que la erradicación de la pobreza es el mayor problema que afronta el mundo en la actualidad, y concedemos la máxima prioridad a la erradicación de la pobreza en la agenda de desarrollo de las Naciones Unidas para después de 2015, que debe apoyarse con medios efectivos y adecuados de aplicación y con una alianza mundial para el desarrollo fortalecida, y que entre otros objetivos entraña la promoción del empleo y el trabajo decente para todos, el mejoramiento del acceso a los servicios sociales, la erradicación del analfabetismo y las enfermedades, y la aplicación de estrategias nacionales y regionales integradas, coordinadas y coherentes. 44. Expresamos nuestra profunda preocupación por los problemas que afectan la lucha contra la pobreza como consecuencia de las crisis, en particular la crisis financiera y económica mundial, la continua inseguridad alimentaria, la volatilidad de las corrientes de capital y la extrema volatilidad de los precios de los productos básicos, el acceso a la energía y los problemas que plantea el cambio climático para los países en desarrollo. 45. Subrayamos también que, a fin de que los gobiernos de los países en desarrollo puedan erradicar efectivamente la pobreza, los países en desarrollo deben garantizar la implicación nacional en sus propios programas de desarrollo, lo que conlleva la preservación de sus propios márgenes de acción en materia de políticas respaldados por un firme compromiso político para reducir la pobreza de conformidad con sus prioridades y circunstancias nacionales. En consecuencia, los gobiernos de los países en desarrollo deben formular sus propias estrategias de desarrollo para ayudar a los pobres con políticas y medidas, entre las que cabe mencionar el fomento de un fuerte crecimiento económico sostenido e inclusivo, la concesión de prioridad a la generación de empleo, en particular para la población joven, el suministro de un mejor acceso universal y asequible a los servicios básicos, el establecimiento de un sistema de protección social bien concebido, el empoderamiento de las personas para que puedan aprovechar las oportunidades económicas y la adopción de medidas para garantizar la protección del medio ambiente. 46. Recordamos la Convención de las Naciones Unidas contra la Corrupción, que es el instrumento más completo y universal sobre la corrupción, y reconocemos la necesidad de seguir promoviendo la ratificación o la adhesión a la Convención y su plena aplicación. También reconocemos que la lucha contra la corrupción a todos los niveles es una prioridad, que la corrupción es un serio obstáculo para la movilización y asignación efectivas de recursos y que desvía recursos de actividades que son vitales para la erradicación de la pobreza y el desarrollo sostenible. 47. Tomamos nota con aprecio de los valores tradicionales y ancestrales de algunos de nuestros pueblos, como los principios andinos de ama suwa ("no seas ladrón"), ama llulla ("no seas mentiroso") y ama qhilla ("no seas perezoso") y que, de conformidad con todos los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales, contribuyen a los esfuerzos para prevenir y combatir la corrupción. Reducción de la desigualdad 48. Hacemos hincapié en que el problema de la desigualdad es más grave que nunca debido a la prevalencia de la riqueza extrema mientras se sigue padeciendo hambre y pobreza, y en que esta situación se agrava, entre otras cosas, por unas pautas de consumo y producción insostenibles, principalmente en los países desarrollados. Afirmamos que todo beneficio del crecimiento económico tiene que distribuirse de manera equitativa y debe beneficiar a las personas en situaciones vulnerables en nuestras comunidades, por lo que pedimos una vez más que se tomen medidas concertadas para reducir las desigualdades a todos los niveles. 49. Estamos profundamente preocupados por la insuficiencia de las medidas adoptadas para reducir la disparidad cada vez mayor que existe entre los países desarrollados y los países en desarrollo, así como dentro de los países, que ha contribuido, entre otras cosas, a agravar la pobreza y ha menoscabado el pleno disfrute de todos los derechos humanos, particularmente en los países en desarrollo. 50. También tomamos nota con preocupación de que el alto grado de desigualdad dentro de los países y entre ellos sigue repercutiendo negativamente en todos los aspectos del desarrollo humano y es especialmente perjudicial para las personas en situaciones vulnerables, quienes resultan afectadas por desigualdades interrelacionadas. Por lo tanto, instamos a los países a que, con el apoyo de la cooperación internacional y otros medios, intensifiquen los esfuerzos por ofrecer un acceso equitativo a las oportunidades y los resultados a todos los sectores de la sociedad, de conformidad con las políticas nacionales. 51. Entendemos que el desarrollo sostenible entraña un cambio en el orden de las prioridades de la generación de riqueza material a la satisfacción de las necesidades humanas en Armonía con la Naturaleza. La excesiva orientación hacia el lucro, no respeta la Madre Tierra ni tiene en cuenta las necesidades humanas. La continuación de este sistema desigual aumentará las desigualdades. Crecimiento económico sostenido e inclusivo 52. Afirmamos que el crecimiento económico sostenido, inclusivo y equitativo es necesario para erradicar la pobreza, generar empleo y elevar el nivel de vida de nuestros pueblos y generar ingresos públicos para financiar las políticas sociales. Observamos que los datos históricos han demostrado que ningún país ha logrado mejorar de modo constante las condiciones de vida y el desarrollo humano sin mantener un ritmo de crecimiento económico regular. Por lo tanto, instamos a la comunidad internacional y las Naciones Unidas a que ayuden a los países en desarrollo a lograr un crecimiento económico elevado y adecuado durante un período prolongado. 53. También somos conscientes de que un elevado crecimiento económico, aunque necesario, no basta por sí mismo. Somos conscientes de que el crecimiento económico debe ser sostenido e inclusivo generando puestos de trabajo y aumentando los ingresos de las personas en situaciones vulnerables, especialmente los pobres y los más necesitados. El crecimiento económico también debe ser racional desde el punto de vista ecológico y social, y para lograrlo, los países en desarrollo necesitan, entre otras fuentes, apoyo financiero y tecnológico de los países desarrollados con arreglo a los planes nacionales Creación de empleo 54. Expresamos la opinión de que la capacidad de generar empleo pleno y trabajo decente está fundamentalmente relacionada con la revitalización y el fortalecimiento de estrategias de desarrollo productivo, mediante la aplicación de políticas adecuadas en materia de financiación, inversión y comercio. A este respecto, reafirmamos la necesidad de movilizar una considerable cantidad de recursos procedentes de diversas fuentes y utilizar eficazmente los fondos a fin de apoyar firmemente a los países en desarrollo en sus iniciativas para promover el desarrollo sostenible. También subrayamos la necesidad de mantener la coherencia entre las políticas macroeconómicas y de creación de empleo para asegurar un crecimiento económico mundial inclusivo y resiliente. 55. Expresamos profunda preocupación por la persistencia de los altos niveles de desempleo y subempleo, en particular entre los jóvenes, y afirmamos nuestro compromiso de reducir el desempleo mediante políticas económicas y de desarrollo orientadas a generar un gran número de puestos de trabajo. Afirmamos la necesidad de poner en marcha un proceso intergubernamental, en el marco de las Naciones Unidas, a fin de incluir la cuestión del empleo de los jóvenes y las inquietudes de los jóvenes en el actual proceso de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015. Afirmamos también la importancia de asegurar unos medios de vida dignos para los agricultores de nuestros países. 56. Afirmamos la necesidad de poner en marcha un proceso intergubernamental, en el marco de las Naciones Unidas, para elaborar una estrategia mundial dirigida a mejorar la formación para el empleo y crear empleo para los jóvenes. Prestación de servicios básicos para nuestros pueblos 57. Nos preocupa que sigan existiendo diferencias sustanciales y cada vez mayores entre los ricos y los pobres del mundo, diferencias que no obedecen únicamente al reparto desigual de la riqueza, sino también a las disparidades en materia de acceso a los recursos y servicios básicos, lo que impide que se creen oportunidades económicas para todos. 58. Reconocemos la importante función que corresponde desempeñar al Estado para velar por que todas las personas tengan acceso a los servicios básicos y buscar soluciones a las desigualdades y la discriminación relativas a la distribución de esos servicios y el acceso a ellos. 59. También reafirmamos nuestra determinación de adoptar medidas que hagan efectivo el derecho de nuestros pueblos a acceder a los servicios básicos. 60. Reafirmamos nuestros compromisos respecto del derecho humano al agua potable y el saneamiento, que debe materializarse y hacerse efectivo gradualmente en beneficio de nuestra población, respetando plenamente nuestra soberanía nacional. 61. Exhortamos a los países donantes y las organizaciones internacionales a que registren progresos en el suministro de recursos financieros, la creación de capacidad y la transferencia de tecnología por medio de las actividades internacionales de prestación de asistencia a los países en desarrollo y de cooperación con ellos, a fin de intensificar los esfuerzos para proporcionar a toda la población un acceso económico y en condiciones de seguridad al agua potable y el saneamiento. Acceso a la salud pública y a los medicamentos 62. Reconocemos que la cobertura sanitaria universal implica que todas las personas tengan acceso, sin discriminación, a un conjunto de servicios médicos básicos de promoción, prevención, cura y rehabilitación que se ajuste a las necesidades y se determine a nivel nacional, así como a medicamentos esenciales, seguros, asequibles, eficaces y de calidad, al tiempo que se garantiza que la utilización de esos servicios no suponga graves dificultades económicas para los usuarios, especialmente para quienes se encuentran en situación vulnerable. 63. También reconocemos que en muchos países en desarrollo no existen los recursos financieros ni humanos ni la infraestructura necesaria para hacer efectivo el derecho de todas las personas a disfrutar del más alto nivel posible de salud física y mental. Por tanto, exhortamos a los países desarrollados y a las organizaciones internacionales competentes a que proporcionen a esos países recursos financieros y tecnológicos suficientes como complemento a sus esfuerzos para establecer políticas y medidas que proporcionen cobertura sanitaria universal y servicios básicos de salud para todos. 64. Observamos con gran preocupación que las enfermedades no transmisibles han alcanzado grandes dimensiones epidémicas que debilitan el desarrollo sostenible de los Estados miembros. En ese sentido, reconocemos la eficacia de las medidas de control del tabaco para mejorar la salud. Reafirmamos el derecho de los Estados miembros a proteger la salud pública y, en particular, a garantizar el acceso universal a los medicamentos y las tecnologías de diagnóstico médico, por ejemplo, utilizando de forma plena, si fuera necesario, las flexibilidades previstas en la Declaración de Doha relativa al Acuerdo sobre los Aspectos de los Derechos de Propiedad Intelectual Relacionados con el Comercio (ADPIC) y la Salud Pública. 65. Recordamos el contenido del párrafo 142 del documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible, en el que los Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno "reafirman el derecho a aplicar plenamente las disposiciones del Acuerdo ADPIC, la Declaración de Doha relativa al Acuerdo ADPIC y la Salud Pública, la decisión del Consejo General de la Organización Mundial del Comercio (OMC), de 30 de agosto de 2003, relacionada con la aplicación del párrafo 6 de la Declaración de Doha, y, cuando concluyan los procedimientos formales de aceptación, la enmienda al artículo 31 del Acuerdo ADPIC, que otorgan flexibilidad para la protección de la salud pública y, en particular, para promover el acceso universal a los medicamentos, y alientan a que se preste asistencia a los países en desarrollo a este respecto". Afirmamos la importancia de aprovechar las flexibilidades que ofrece el Acuerdo ADPIC para promover la salud de las personas y el acceso a los medicamentos. Exhortamos a los países desarrollados a que respeten plenamente el derecho de los países en desarrollo a aprovechar al máximo las flexibilidades previstas en el Acuerdo ADPIC y a que se abstengan de adoptar medidas, incluso de índole comercial, que impidan que los países en desarrollo ejerzan este derecho o que los disuadan de hacerlo. 66. Nos preocupa el creciente problema de la resistencia a los medicamentos antimicrobianos, incluidos los fármacos existentes para luchar contra la tuberculosis y la malaria. Como consecuencia de esto, un número cada vez mayor de enfermos, especialmente en los países en desarrollo, puede morir a causa de enfermedades que pueden prevenirse o tratarse. Instamos a las autoridades y organizaciones internacionales de la salud, en especial a la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), a que adopten medidas urgentes y a que, a solicitud de los países en desarrollo que no cuentan con los recursos adecuados, cooperen con ellos para solucionar este problema. Desarrollo agrícola y seguridad alimentaria 67. Recordamos que la seguridad alimentaria y la nutrición son elementos indispensables para alcanzar el desarrollo sostenible y expresamos nuestra preocupación por el hecho de que los países en desarrollo son vulnerables, entre otras cosas, a los efectos adversos del cambio climático, que amenazan todavía más la seguridad alimentaria. 68. Reafirmamos que el hambre es una violación de la dignidad humana e instamos a que se adopten medidas urgentes en los planos nacional, regional e internacional para eliminarla. Reafirmamos también el derecho de toda persona a disponer de alimentos sanos y nutritivos de conformidad con su derecho a una alimentación adecuada y su derecho fundamental a no padecer hambre, a fin de poder desarrollar y mantener su plena capacidad física y mental. Reconocemos también que la seguridad alimentaria y la nutrición son esenciales para el desarrollo sostenible y se han convertido en un desafío mundial apremiante y, a este respecto, reafirmamos también nuestro compromiso de aumentar la seguridad alimentaria y el acceso de las generaciones presentes y futuras a alimentos suficientes, sanos y nutritivos, en consonancia con los Cinco Principios de Roma para la Seguridad Alimentaria Mundial Sostenible, aprobados el 16 de noviembre de 2009, especialmente en favor de los niños menores de 2 años, y mediante estrategias de seguridad alimentaria y nutrición nacionales, regionales y mundiales, según proceda. 69. Denunciamos que las subvenciones y otras distorsiones del mercado impulsadas por los países desarrollados han perjudicado gravemente al sector agrícola de los países en desarrollo, limitando la capacidad de este sector fundamental para contribuir significativamente a la erradicación de la pobreza y a un crecimiento económico sostenido e incluyente, al desarrollo sostenible y equitativo, a la seguridad alimentaria y al desarrollo rural. Pedimos que se anulen de inmediato todas las formas de subvenciones agrícolas y otras medidas adoptadas por los países desarrollados que distorsionan los mercados y que no se ajustan a las normas establecidas por la OMC. Instamos a los países desarrollados a que demuestren la flexibilidad y la voluntad política necesarias para abordar debidamente estas preocupaciones fundamentales de los países en desarrollo en la Ronda de Doha de negociaciones comerciales. 70. Reiteramos nuestro compromiso de concluir disciplinas multilaterales sobre las subvenciones a la pesca que den efecto al Programa de Doha para el Desarrollo, de la OMC, y a los mandatos de la Declaración Ministerial de Hong Kong para hacer más estrictas las disciplinas sobre las subvenciones en el sector pesquero, incluso prohibiendo determinadas modalidades de subvenciones a la pesca que contribuyen a la capacidad de pesca excesiva y la sobrepesca, reconociendo que la negociación en la OMC de las subvenciones a la pesca debe incluir un trato especial y diferenciado, apropiado y efectivo para los países en desarrollo y menos adelantados, teniendo en cuenta la importancia del sector para las prioridades de desarrollo, la reducción de la pobreza y las cuestiones relativas a los medios de subsistencia y la seguridad alimentaria. 71. Ponemos de relieve la necesidad de fortalecer la capacidad de nuestros países, en especial mediante la cooperación internacional, para salvaguardar y mejorar la calidad de la nutrición de nuestros pueblos, promoviendo sus prácticas productivas, culturales y ambientales. 72. Ponemos de relieve también la urgente necesidad de intensificar en los planos nacional, regional e internacional los esfuerzos para alcanzar la seguridad alimentaria y el desarrollo agrícola como parte fundamental de la agenda internacional para el desarrollo. Exigimos una financiación sostenida y más inversiones dirigidas concretamente a aumentar la producción de alimentos en el mundo, y pedimos recursos financieros nuevos y adicionales de todas las fuentes para materializar el desarrollo agrícola sostenible y la seguridad alimentaria. 73. Ponemos de relieve además la necesidad de fortalecer el sector agrícola, en el contexto de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 y sus medios de aplicación, a fin de alcanzar la seguridad alimentaria, destacando la importancia de que en las estrategias nacionales, regionales e internacionales dirigidas a alcanzar esa seguridad se incluyan los conocimientos, las prácticas y las tecnologías propias de los pueblos indígenas, las comunidades rurales y los pequeños y medianos productores agrícolas. 74. Acogemos con beneplácito la adopción de las resoluciones de la Asamblea General 68/177 sobre el derecho a la alimentación y 68/233 sobre desarrollo agrícola, seguridad alimentaria y nutrición. Acogemos con beneplácito también la Segunda Conferencia Internacional sobre Nutrición, convocada por la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Alimentación y la Agricultura (FAO) y la OMS, que tendrá lugar en la sede de la FAO en Roma del 19 al 21 de noviembre de 2014, con objeto de aprobar el marco normativo sobre nutrición para las próximas décadas y definir las prioridades que regirán la cooperación internacional en el ámbito de la nutrición a corto y mediano plazos. 75. Acogemos con beneplácito la decisión del Director General de la FAO de nombrar por segundo año consecutivo al Sr. Juan Evo Morales Ayma, Presidente del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, y a la Sra. Nadine Heredia Alarcón, Primera Dama del Perú, Embajadores Especiales ante la FAO para el Año Internacional de la Quinua, en reconocimiento de su liderazgo y compromiso en la lucha contra el hambre y la malnutrición, y de la labor realizada por los Gobiernos de Bolivia y el Perú para mostrar al mundo los beneficios y la calidad de esa fuente andina de alimento. 76. Reafirmamos que la biodiversidad y el valor nutricional de la quinua la convierten en un elemento clave para la seguridad alimentaria, la nutrición y la erradicación de la pobreza, así como para promover los conocimientos tradicionales de los pueblos indígenas andinos; contribuir al logro de la seguridad alimentaria, la nutrición y la erradicación de la pobreza; crear conciencia sobre su contribución al desarrollo social, económico y ambiental; e intercambiar buenas prácticas sobre la realización de actividades. 77. Llamamos a que se creen unas condiciones propicias para el surgimiento de oportunidades económicas provechosas para los pequeños agricultores y las explotaciones familiares, los campesinos y los pueblos y las comunidades indígenas, y a que se establezcan vías para conectar a estos grupos con los consumidores, en el marco de las estrategias nacionales para hacer efectivo el derecho a la alimentación. 78. Reconocemos la función positiva que desempeñan los pequeños agricultores y las explotaciones familiares, incluidas las mujeres, las cooperativas, los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades locales de los países en desarrollo, así como sus conocimientos y prácticas en la conservación y el uso sostenible de las semillas, la biodiversidad agrícola y la biodiversidad vinculada a la producción de alimentos de las generaciones presentes y futuras. 79. Destacamos la necesidad de hacer frente a las causas profundas de la inestabilidad excesiva de los precios de los alimentos, incluidas sus causas estructurales, en todos los niveles, y de gestionar los riesgos derivados de la inestabilidad excesiva de los precios de los productos básicos agrícolas y sus consecuencias para la seguridad alimentaria y la nutrición a nivel mundial, así como para los pequeños agricultores y los pobres de las zonas urbanas. 80. Llamamos a que en la ronda de negociaciones de Doha de la OMC se conceda prioridad al desarrollo y, en concreto, a la seguridad alimentaria, de conformidad con el Programa de Doha para el Desarrollo. Llamamos a que se promuevan los medios de subsistencia de los pequeños agricultores y el desarrollo rural en los países en desarrollo. En este contexto, instamos a los miembros de la OMC a que adopten, lo antes posible, una solución permanente para la cuestión de las existencias públicas de alimentos y la seguridad alimentaria en relación con los países en desarrollo, como se acordó mediante la Decisión Ministerial de la OMC aprobada en Bali (Indonesia) en 2013. Agricultura familiar sostenible 81. Declaramos que la agricultura familiar y las pequeñas explotaciones agrícolas son una base importante para la producción sostenible de alimentos orientada a lograr la seguridad alimentaria (resolución 66/222 de la Asamblea General). En este contexto, debería prestarse apoyo a la actividad económica de la agricultura familiar sostenible, teniendo en cuenta los conocimientos tradicionales de los pequeños agricultores, a fin de mejorar su situación y promover su desarrollo, en particular facilitando su acceso a los servicios financieros, los recursos productivos y los insumos agrícolas, como las tierras, las semillas, los medios tecnológicos adecuados, el transporte y la información. 82. Fomentaremos la adopción de medidas exhaustivas y complementarias tanto a nivel nacional como regional en materia de producción, acceso y consumo sobre la base de una planificación integral, multisectorial y participativa, volviendo a evaluar y fortaleciendo la agricultura familiar sostenible, las pequeñas explotaciones agrícolas, y las prácticas agrícolas de los pueblos indígenas y los afrodescendientes. Industrialización e infraestructura 83. Afirmamos que el desarrollo industrial y la creación de valor añadido, junto con la ciencia, la tecnología y la innovación, son, entre otros, elementos esenciales para que los países en desarrollo alcancen mayores niveles de desarrollo de manera sostenida, dado que el proceso de industrialización puede generar una mayor productividad, más puestos de trabajo y competencias técnicas y efectos positivos indirectos en la economía. En consecuencia, instamos a los países desarrollados a que ayuden a los países en desarrollo a impulsar la industrialización en sus estrategias y políticas de desarrollo y a promover el desarrollo industrial sostenible con arreglo a sus intereses nacionales. 84. Observamos que muchos países en desarrollo aún dependen excesivamente de los productos básicos y hacemos notar que deberían estudiar estrategias de diversificación industrial mediante, entre otras cosas, el aumento de las capacidades productivas con valor añadido. 85. Exhortamos a las organizaciones internacionales competentes y pedimos a los mecanismos de cooperación internacional que presten una asistencia adecuada a los países en desarrollo, incluso mediante la transferencia de tecnología, para que puedan desarrollar su capacidad para formular y aplicar políticas y estrategias de industrialización, de conformidad con sus prioridades nacionales. 86. Pedimos que en el sistema comercial internacional se respete y consolide el margen normativo de los países en desarrollo para la promoción y el crecimiento de nuestro desarrollo industrial y para la formulación y aplicación de nuestras estrategias industriales. A ese respecto, pedimos que se haga una revisión de todas las normas del sistema comercial mundial que afecten al espacio normativo de los países en desarrollo. 87. Afirmamos que el desarrollo de infraestructuras fiables y económicas, la conectividad regional, y su apropiada interrelación a través de la ciencia, la tecnología y la innovación, incluidos el transporte, las carreteras, la energía y las telecomunicaciones, así como la promoción del acceso a los mercados para las exportaciones procedentes de los países en desarrollo, son elementos esenciales para mejorar la calidad de vida de nuestros pueblos y el desarrollo sostenible de nuestros países. 88. En ese sentido, instamos a los países desarrollados y las organizaciones internacionales a que, en consonancia con los compromisos asumidos en el plano internacional, proporcionen asistencia financiera suficiente para apoyar la transferencia de tecnologías fiables y de costo razonable y promover la creación de capacidad, teniendo en cuenta las prioridades nacionales. 89. Instamos a los países desarrollados a que proporcionen asistencia técnica, transferencia de tecnología y recursos financieros para que nuestros países puedan industrializarse y desarrollar la infraestructura por medios que sean sostenibles en el plano ambiental. 90. Ponemos de relieve a ese respecto la importancia que reviste la asistencia técnica para el desarrollo industrial de los Estados Miembros con el fin de adoptar modalidades de consumo y producción sostenibles menos contaminantes, basadas en los recursos y de alto rendimiento energético, que incluyan tecnologías menos contaminantes para el aprovechamiento de los combustibles fósiles. 91. Acogemos con beneplácito la iniciativa del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, en su calidad de Presidente del Grupo de los 77 y China, de organizar la Reunión de ministros de industrialización o autoridades equivalentes del Grupo de los 77 y China sobre la cuestión de la gobernanza de los recursos naturales y la industrialización, en coordinación con la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo Industrial (ONUDI), la Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe, la Comisión Económica para África, la Comisión Económica y Social para Asia y el Pacífico y la Comisión Económica y Social para Asia Occidental, reunión que se celebrará en Tarija en agosto de 2014. 92. Acogemos con beneplácito la Declaración de Lima: hacia un desarrollo industrial inclusivo y sostenible, aprobada en el 15º período de sesiones de la Conferencia General de la ONUDI que se celebró en Lima en diciembre de 2013, como un paso importante en nuestros esfuerzos por lograr el desarrollo sostenible y la erradicación de la pobreza. Inclusión de la mujer en el desarrollo 93. Recordamos el documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible, reafirmamos el papel fundamental de la mujer y la necesidad de lograr su participación y liderazgo plenos y en pie de igualdad en todos los ámbitos del desarrollo sostenible, y decidimos acelerar el cumplimiento de nuestros respectivos compromisos en este sentido, que figuran en la Convención sobre la Eliminación de Todas las Formas de Discriminación contra la Mujer, así como en el Programa 21, la Declaración y Plataforma de Acción de Beijing, la Declaración del Milenio y el Programa de Acción de la Conferencia Internacional sobre la Población y el Desarrollo de 1994. 94. Reconocemos también que el potencial de las mujeres para colaborar en el desarrollo sostenible, contribuir a este y beneficiarse de él como líderes, participantes y agentes de cambio no se ha hecho plenamente efectivo. Apoyamos que se asigne prioridad a las medidas para promover la igualdad entre los géneros y el empoderamiento de las mujeres y las niñas en todas las esferas de nuestras sociedades. Resolvemos aprovechar el potencial de las mujeres como impulsoras del desarrollo sostenible por numerosos medios y nos comprometemos a crear un entorno propicio para mejorar la situación de las mujeres y las niñas en todas partes, especialmente en las zonas rurales y las comunidades locales, así como entre los pueblos indígenas y las minorías étnicas. 95. Estamos comprometidos a lograr la igualdad de derechos y oportunidades de las mujeres en la adopción de decisiones políticas y económicas y la asignación de recursos, a otorgar a las mujeres iguales derechos que los hombres a los recursos económicos y a asegurar su acceso a la educación, las finanzas, las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones, los mercados, la asistencia letrada y otros servicios básicos, entre ellos los servicios de atención de la salud, incluidos los métodos modernos seguros, eficaces, asequibles y aceptables de planificación familiar. 96. Recordamos los compromisos respectivos que asumimos con arreglo a la resolución 61/143 de la Asamblea General y otras resoluciones sobre la cuestión, reconocemos que la violencia contra la mujer viola gravemente todos sus derechos humanos, y acordamos por tanto adoptar medidas para eliminar todas las formas de violencia contra la mujer, incluidos el feminicidio y la discriminación de las mujeres y las niñas, mediante una respuesta más sistemática, amplia, multisectorial y sostenida, apoyada y facilitada adecuadamente por sólidos mecanismos institucionales y métodos de financiación, así como por planes de acción nacionales, incluidos los que se realizan con el apoyo de la cooperación internacional, y, según proceda, por planes nacionales de desarrollo, incluidas las estrategias de erradicación de la pobreza y los enfoques sectoriales y basados en los programas. 97. Reafirmamos el compromiso de trabajar juntos para formular una agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 con perspectiva de género. 98. Instamos a que se haga frente a los problemas fundamentales que siguen teniendo las mujeres y las niñas mediante un enfoque amplio y con vocación transformadora y hacemos un llamamiento para que la igualdad entre los géneros y el empoderamiento de las mujeres y las niñas se recojan en un objetivo de desarrollo sostenible independiente y se incorporen por medio de metas en las políticas inclusivas para superar la pobreza y fomentar el desarrollo social y económico de nuestros países. Pueblos indígenas 99. Instamos a trabajar en pro de la realización de los derechos de los pueblos indígenas sobre sus tierras, recursos naturales, identidad y cultura, de conformidad con la legislación nacional. Reafirmamos nuestros compromisos respectivos de cumplir nuestras obligaciones jurídicas, en particular, según proceda, el Convenio núm. 169 de la Organización Internacional del Trabajo, así como de promover la aplicación de la Declaración de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Derechos de los Pueblos Indígenas. 100. Reafirmamos el valor y la diversidad de las culturas y las formas de organización social de los pueblos indígenas y sus conocimientos científicos e innovaciones y prácticas tradicionales holísticas, que contribuyen de manera significativa a fortalecer los medios de vida de la población local, garantizar la seguridad alimentaria y hacer frente al cambio climático. 101. Destacamos la importancia de los pueblos indígenas para el logro del desarrollo sostenible en los países en desarrollo y la función crucial que desempeñan en los procesos sociales, económicos y políticos de nuestros países, a la vez que fortalecen los puntos de vista y valores locales conocidos como visiones holísticas de la Madre Tierra. 102. Reafirmamos la importancia de la acción colectiva y los esfuerzos de las comunidades indígenas y locales para conservar la diversidad biológica, teniendo en cuenta que contribuyen decisivamente a la ordenación y gestión sostenible de los recursos naturales renovables. 103. Consideramos que la adaptación al cambio climático y la mitigación de sus efectos dependen de los distintos contextos socioculturales, teniendo especialmente en cuenta a los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades locales y sus sistemas de conocimientos y prácticas tradicionales, incluida su visión holística de la comunidad y el medio ambiente, como un importante medio de adaptación al cambio climático. 104. Pedimos que se fortalezca el diálogo intercientífico entre los sistemas de conocimientos tradicionales e indígenas y las ciencias modernas en el contexto de la Plataforma Intergubernamental Científico-Normativa sobre Diversidad Biológica y Servicios de los Ecosistemas y del marco conceptual "Vivir bien en armonía y equilibrio con la Madre Tierra", aprobado por la Plataforma. 105. Acogemos con beneplácito que se haya convocado la reunión plenaria de alto nivel del sexagésimo noveno período de sesiones de la Asamblea General, que con el nombre de Conferencia Mundial de Pueblos Indígenas se celebrará en Nueva York los días 22 y 23 de septiembre de 2014, con el fin de intercambiar ideas y mejores prácticas sobre la aplicación de la Declaración de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Derechos de los Pueblos Indígenas. El documento final de la Conferencia, que estará orientado a la acción, debe contribuir a la realización de los derechos de los pueblos indígenas y la consecución de los objetivos de la Declaración y promover el logro de todos los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente. 106. Tomamos nota de la Declaración especial sobre la hoja de coca suscrita en La Habana el 29 de enero de 2014 por los Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno de los países de América Latina y el Caribe reunidos en ocasión de la Cumbre de Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno de la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños, en la que se reconoce la importancia de conservar las prácticas culturales y ancestrales de los pueblos originarios, en el marco del respeto de los derechos humanos y los derechos fundamentales de los pueblos indígenas, de conformidad con los instrumentos internacionales pertinentes. En ese contexto, los Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno reconocen el masticado (akulliku o chacchado) de la hoja de coca como una manifestación cultural ancestral de los pueblos de la región andina, que debe ser respetada por la comunidad internacional, y expresan interés en conocer los resultados de investigaciones científicas acerca de las propiedades de la hoja de coca realizadas por institutos y universidades de la comunidad internacional de reconocido prestigio en la materia.
Parte III
Cooperación Sur-Sur
107. Reafirmamos el documento final de Nairobi de la Conferencia de Alto Nivel de las Naciones Unidas sobre la Cooperación Sur-Sur y, por lo tanto, reconocemos la importancia, las diferencias históricas y las particularidades de la cooperación Sur-Sur, y reafirmamos nuestra opinión de que la cooperación Sur-Sur es una expresión de solidaridad entre los pueblos y países del Sur que contribuye a su bienestar nacional, su autosuficiencia nacional y colectiva y el logro de los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente, incluidos los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio. La cooperación Sur-Sur y su programa deben ser determinados por los países del Sur y seguir orientándose por los principios del respeto de la soberanía, la implicación y la independencia nacionales, la igualdad, la no condicionalidad, la no injerencia en los asuntos internos y el beneficio mutuo. 108. Reafirmamos la importancia de fortalecer la cooperación Sur-Sur, especialmente en el actual entorno económico internacional, y reiteramos nuestro apoyo a la cooperación Sur-Sur como estrategia para respaldar la labor de los países en desarrollo en pro del desarrollo y como medio de fomentar su participación en la economía mundial. Reiteramos la posición del Grupo de que la cooperación Sur-Sur complementa, pero no sustituye, a la cooperación Norte-Sur y reafirmamos que se trata de un empeño colectivo de los países en desarrollo basado en el principio de solidaridad y en premisas, condiciones y objetivos específicos del contexto histórico y político de los países en desarrollo y de sus necesidades y expectativas, por lo que la cooperación Sur-Sur debería fomentarse de modo separado e independiente, tal y como se reafirmó en el documento final de Nairobi. En este contexto, recalcamos que la cooperación Sur-Sur y su programa deben ser impulsados por los países del Sur. La cooperación Sur-Sur, que es fundamental para los países en desarrollo, exige una perspectiva de largo plazo y el mecanismo institucional mundial previsto en la Segunda Cumbre del Sur. 109. Acogemos con beneplácito la reunión del Grupo de Alto Nivel de Personalidades Eminentes del Sur, celebrada en Natadola (Fiji) del 7 al 9 de mayo de 2013, de conformidad con el mandato pertinente de la Segunda Cumbre del Sur. Acogemos con beneplácito también las conclusiones y recomendaciones del Grupo sobre el panorama futuro de la cooperación Sur-Sur como una contribución importante para el desarrollo ulterior de la Plataforma de Desarrollo para el Sur. Reiteramos el marco y los principios de la cooperación Sur-Sur que los Ministros de Relaciones Exteriores del Grupo de los 77 hicieron suyos por primera vez en su 32ª reunión anual, celebrada en Nueva York el 26 de septiembre de 2008, que el Grupo utilizó también como base para sus deliberaciones. 110. Acogemos con beneplácito la conclusión de la tercera ronda de negociaciones del Sistema Global de Preferencias Comerciales, que es un instrumento para promover y fortalecer la integración comercial Sur-Sur y exhortamos a que más países en desarrollo participen en el Sistema Global. 111. También señalamos y acogemos con beneplácito el aumento de las iniciativas de cooperación regional que manifiestan de manera concreta la cooperación y la integración Sur-Sur en esferas diversas como las finanzas, la banca, el comercio, la atención de la salud y la producción de alimentos. Esperamos que estas iniciativas beneficien no solo a los participantes en los programas regionales, sino también a otros países en desarrollo. Hacemos un llamamiento para que se adopten otras iniciativas en el futuro, así como maneras concretas en que los países en desarrollo puedan intercambiar experiencias y buenas prácticas para difundir estas iniciativas Sur-Sur. 112. Alentamos a nuestros países a intercambiar experiencias y mejores prácticas en materia de igualdad de acceso a los servicios básicos para todos. 113. Destacamos que el Comité de Alto Nivel sobre la Cooperación Sur-Sur, de la Asamblea General, es el principal organismo normativo multilateral del sistema de las Naciones Unidas encargado de examinar y evaluar los progresos realizados a nivel mundial y en todo el sistema y el apoyo en materia de cooperación Sur-Sur para el desarrollo, incluida la cooperación triangular, y de impartir orientación general sobre la dirección futura. 114. Destacamos también que la cooperación Sur-Sur, como elemento importante de la cooperación internacional para el desarrollo, no sustituye, sino que complementa la cooperación Norte-Sur y que su programa debe ser establecido por los países del Sur. Apoyamos la integración de la cooperación Sur-Sur y la cooperación triangular en las políticas y el marco estratégico de los fondos y programas del sistema de las Naciones Unidas, así como su fortalecimiento mediante la asignación a nivel de todo el sistema de recursos adicionales, entre ellos recursos financieros y humanos, a la Oficina de las Naciones Unidas para la Cooperación Sur-Sur, y reconocemos que la Oficina, acogida actualmente por el Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD), constituye una entidad separada, con un carácter jurídico particular, encargada de la coordinación, a nivel mundial y en el sistema de las Naciones Unidas, de la promoción y facilitación de iniciativas relacionadas con la cooperación Sur-Sur para el desarrollo. 115. En este sentido, solicitamos que se establezca un mecanismo de coordinación interinstitucional más formal y robusto para la Oficina de las Naciones Unidas para la Cooperación Sur-Sur, a fin de alentar la prestación de un apoyo conjunto a las iniciativas de cooperación Sur-Sur y de cooperación triangular, y de intercambiar información sobre las actividades de desarrollo y los resultados obtenidos por los distintos fondos, organismos y organizaciones en apoyo de la cooperación Sur-Sur y la cooperación triangular. 116. Exhortamos también al Sistema de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo a promover la transferencia de tecnologías desde los países desarrollados en beneficio de los países en desarrollo a fin de resolver las cuestiones relativas a la erradicación de la pobreza y el desarrollo sostenible, y, en este contexto, alentamos, en la medida de lo posible, la cooperación tecnológica entre los países del Sur. 117. Reconocemos el papel desempeñado por el Centro del Sur en el apoyo al Grupo de los 77. Exhortamos a los miembros del Grupo a que sigan apoyando la labor del Centro y al Centro a que amplíe sus actividades en beneficio de los países en desarrollo. Alentamos a las organizaciones de países en desarrollo, incluidos los del Centro del Sur, a aportar ideas y proponer planes de acción para seguir llevando a la práctica la cooperación Sur-Sur. Parte IV
Desafíos mundiales
Alianza mundial para el desarrollo 118. Desatacamos la necesidad de que los países desarrollados asuman un nuevo y mayor compromiso con la cooperación internacional a fin de prestar apoyo al cumplimiento de las aspiraciones de desarrollo de los países en desarrollo. En el marco de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio, se asumió un compromiso respecto de una alianza mundial para el desarrollo, que representaba la dimensión de cooperación internacional del marco de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio. No obstante, observamos con preocupación el considerable retraso en la alianza en relación con los Objetivos, que contribuyó a que no se lograran muchos de los objetivos y de las metas. Por consiguiente, pedimos que se cumplan urgentemente todos los compromisos asumidos en el marco de la alianza mundial para el desarrollo con el fin de corregir los desfases señalados en los informes del Equipo de Tareas sobre el Desfase en el Logro de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio. 119. También exhortamos a los dirigentes de los países desarrollados a que convengan en una nueva fase de cooperación internacional, y se comprometan con ella, mediante el fortalecimiento y la ampliación de la alianza mundial para el desarrollo, que debería ser el elemento central y el ancla tanto de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible como de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015. Esta alianza mundial fortalecida debería incluir las cuestiones relativas al suministro de recursos financieros a los países en desarrollo, la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo, el alivio de la deuda y la reestructuración de la deuda, el comercio, la transferencia de tecnología y una mayor participación de los países en desarrollo en la gobernanza económica mundial. Asistencia oficial para el desarrollo 120. Reafirmamos que la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo sigue siendo la principal fuente internacional de financiación para muchos países en desarrollo y que es esencial como catalizador del desarrollo, ya que facilita el logro de los objetivos de desarrollo nacionales, incluida la labor inconclusa de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio, los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible y la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015, de conformidad con lo establecido en el párrafo 246 del documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible ("El futuro que queremos"). 121. Destacamos que los países desarrollados deben cumplir y ampliar los compromisos asumidos en materia de asistencia oficial para el desarrollo y los objetivos fijados, por ejemplo, en la Declaración del Milenio de las Naciones Unidas, el Consenso de Monterrey, el Documento Final de la Cumbre Mundial de 2005, la Declaración de Doha sobre la Financiación para el Desarrollo y en otros foros pertinentes. Para hacer frente a los consabidos problemas de desarrollo y a los problemas nuevos e incipientes que están surgiendo en los países en desarrollo, en particular los menos adelantados, es indispensable que las corrientes de la asistencia para el desarrollo aumenten y sean más previsibles y sostenibles. Recordamos el incumplimiento del compromiso contraído por los países desarrollados en la reunión celebrada en Gleneagles (Reino de Gran Bretaña e Irlanda del Norte). 122. Instamos a los países desarrollados a que cumplan su compromiso de asignar el 0,7% del ingreso nacional bruto a la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo para los países en desarrollo, así como de lograr la meta de destinar del 0,15% al 0,20% de su ingreso nacional bruto a la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo para los países menos adelantados y la de aumentarla al 1% del ingreso nacional bruto para el año 2030. Expresamos nuestra profunda preocupación por el hecho de que siguen sin cumplirse los compromisos relativos a la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo. 123. Los países desarrollados no pueden utilizar la crisis financiera y económica mundial como pretexto para eludir el cumplimiento de los compromisos ya contraídos en materia de ayuda o la asunción de nuevos compromisos. Para responder con eficacia a la crisis económica, es necesario cumplir puntualmente los compromisos existentes en materia de ayuda, siendo apremiante e ineludiblemente necesario que los donantes los cumplan. Por lo tanto, exhortamos colectivamente a los países desarrollados a que cumplan los compromisos asumidos en materia de asistencia oficial para el desarrollo y aumenten aún más los niveles de ayuda en general, teniendo en cuenta que los países en desarrollo requerirán nuevos recursos financieros adicionales y sostenibles, en gran medida y cuantía, para poner en práctica una amplia gama de actividades de desarrollo. 124. Destacamos la necesidad de asegurar un apoyo financiero nuevo y adicional a los países en desarrollo como uno de los principales medios de ejecución para alcanzar los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio y los próximos Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible. La asistencia financiera debería proporcionarse sin supeditarla a condiciones, puesto que las estrategias de desarrollo deberían ser dirigidas por los países y deberían tener en cuenta las condiciones, necesidades y prioridades propias de los países en desarrollo. Debería basarse en el principio de la responsabilidad común pero diferenciada y en la cooperación Norte-Sur como elemento fundamental y la Cooperación Sur-Sur y la cooperación triangular como complementos útiles. 125. Destacamos que la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo es una fuente importante para financiar el desarrollo de los países en desarrollo que debería utilizarse de conformidad con las prioridades nacionales en materia de desarrollo de esos países, sin condiciones; y expresamos nuestra profunda preocupación por los intentos realizados por países donantes, fuera de los foros de las Naciones Unidas, de redefinir la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo incluyendo otras fuentes de financiación que no están vinculadas o relacionadas con el desarrollo de los países en desarrollo, con el objetivo de ocultar la disminución de las corrientes de asistencia oficial para el desarrollo que no se ajusta a los compromisos que acordaron y que aún no han cumplido. Deuda externa 126. Nos preocupa el hecho de que, con la crisis económica mundial, las economías de un número cada vez mayor de países en desarrollo se están viendo afectadas y de que algunos países se están volviendo más vulnerables a nuevos problemas relacionados con la deuda externa o incluso a crisis. Por consiguiente, resolver los problemas de la deuda externa de los países en desarrollo constituye una parte importante de la cooperación internacional y de la alianza mundial para el desarrollo fortalecida. 127. Opinamos que las crisis de la deuda suelen ser costosas y perturbadoras, y que por lo general van seguidas de grandes recortes del gasto público y de una disminución del crecimiento económico y el empleo. Esas crisis afectan más profundamente a los países en desarrollo, y los que están muy endeudados no pueden regresar a la senda del crecimiento sin asistencia internacional. Reconocemos la importancia que tiene el alivio de la deuda, incluidos los procesos de cancelación, reestructuración, moratoria y auditoría de la deuda. Los procesos de reestructuración de la deuda deben tener como elemento central la determinación de la capacidad real de pago, de modo que no afecten negativamente el crecimiento económico ni el cumplimiento de la tarea inconclusa de hacer realidad los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio, los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible y la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015. A este respecto, reiteramos la necesidad urgente de que la comunidad internacional examine diferentes opciones para establecer un mecanismo internacional de solución del problema de la deuda, que sea eficaz, equitativo, duradero, independiente y orientado al desarrollo, y exhortamos a todos los países a que promuevan los debates que se celebran en el seno de las Naciones Unidas y en otros foros pertinentes, y a que contribuyan a ellos. 128. También recordamos que en decenios anteriores y en los últimos años la gestión de la deuda soberana ha sido una cuestión crucial para los países en desarrollo. En los últimos tiempos, ha surgido una nueva preocupación relacionada con las actividades de los fondos buitre. Algunos ejemplos recientes de las acciones de los fondos buitre en los tribunales internacionales han puesto de manifiesto su carácter altamente especulativo. Esos fondos plantean un peligro para todos los procesos futuros de reestructuración de la deuda, tanto para los países en desarrollo, como para los países desarrollados. Por consiguiente, reiteramos la importancia de no permitir que los fondos buitre paralicen las actividades de reestructuración de la deuda de los países en desarrollo ni priven a los Estados de su derecho a proteger a su pueblo conforme al derecho internacional. 129. Expresamos nuestra grave preocupación por el aumento considerable de los riesgos en materia de estabilidad financiera que encaran muchas economías desarrolladas y, en particular, por las grandes debilidades estructurales que tienen esas economías para financiar la deuda soberana creada como resultado de la transferencia del riesgo privado al sector público. A este respecto, instamos a buscar soluciones urgentes y coherentes que permitan reducir el riesgo soberano de las economías desarrolladas, a fin de prevenir el contagio y mitigar su efecto en el sistema financiero internacional y los países en desarrollo. 130. Hacemos hincapié en la necesidad de asegurar que las políticas económicas y monetarias aplicadas por los países desarrollados no afecten a la demanda agregada y la liquidez mundiales, debido al objetivo de buscar el superávit en sus balanzas de pagos, lo que tiene resultados negativos que se traducen en la reducción de los ingresos globales de los países en desarrollo. Reforma de la estructura financiera mundial 131. Afirmamos la necesidad de reformar la estructura financiera internacional, de manera que tengamos un sistema financiero y monetario que refleje las realidades del siglo XXI, incluido un sector financiero internacional debidamente reglamentado que reduzca y desestimule las inversiones especulativas, a fin de que se puedan movilizar los mercados de capital para alcanzar el desarrollo sostenible, y de que esos mercados desempeñen un papel constructivo en la agenda mundial para el desarrollo. 132. También observamos que siguen existiendo problemas fundamentales en el sistema financiero y monetario mundial, en particular la falta de regulación para garantizar la estabilidad financiera, los problemas de las monedas de reserva, la inestabilidad de los tipos de cambio, las grandes corrientes transfronterizas de capital especulativo y la insuficiencia o inexistencia de liquidez para los países en desarrollo necesitados de recursos financieros, que encaran un déficit de divisas o que requieren recursos para generar un crecimiento y desarrollo sostenibles. Pedimos un programa de reformas, en el que los países en desarrollo tengan voz, representación y participación plenas para hallar una solución a esos problemas. 133. Observamos con preocupación que la desregulación y la liberalización financieras han dado lugar a una enorme ampliación de las corrientes financieras especulativas y del comercio de derivados. La crisis económica y financiera de 2008 ha demostrado que las finanzas internacionales han creado una economía propia, cada vez más desconectada de la economía real de la producción, las inversiones directas, la creación de empleo y el crecimiento de los salarios. Entre los efectos negativos de la financialización se incluyen la inestabilidad de las corrientes de capital, las fluctuaciones excesivas de los precios de los productos básicos y los alimentos, las rápidas fluctuaciones cambiarias y los ciclos de auge y caída en las crisis financieras y la recesión económica. 134. Instamos a que el proceso de reforma de la estructura de gobernanza de las Instituciones de Bretton Woods se finalice lo antes posible y sea mucho más ambicioso, y a que se establezca un plan acelerado de introducción de nuevas reformas en lo relacionado con la representación, la participación y la paridad del número de votos de los países en desarrollo en el proceso de adopción de decisiones de las Instituciones de Bretton Woods y en todos los debates sobre la reforma monetaria internacional, así como en el funcionamiento de los nuevos acuerdos sobre los derechos especiales de giro del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI), sobre la base de criterios que reflejen verdaderamente su mandato en la esfera del desarrollo y con la participación de todas las partes interesadas en un proceso transparente, consultivo e incluyente. A este respecto, pedimos a la Asamblea General que ponga en marcha un proceso de reforma del sistema financiero y monetario internacional. 135. Apoyamos el examen de la posibilidad de crear un mecanismo intergubernamental de las Naciones Unidas en el marco de la Asamblea General, como entidad responsable de supervisar el funcionamiento del sistema económico y financiero mundial de forma integral y sostenible. Es fundamental que este mecanismo supervise el impacto de determinadas corrientes y políticas financieras internacionales que son sistemáticamente importantes para prevenir la propagación de las crisis económicas y financieras entre los países. Reforma del sistema de calificación crediticia 136. Destacamos que en las medidas internacionales para volver a regular al sector financiero se debería incluir a las agencias de calificación crediticia. Los gobiernos deberían limitar su dependencia normativa de las agencias de calificación crediticia y reformar sus regímenes jurídicos para responsabilizar a esas agencias por el comportamiento negligente a fin de eliminar los conflictos de intereses y asegurar la integridad, la rendición de cuentas y la transparencia. 137. También recalcamos la necesidad de contar con un sistema internacional de calificación crediticia más transparente que tenga plenamente en cuenta las necesidades, preocupaciones y peculiaridades de los países en desarrollo, en particular de los muy endeudados. En este sentido, expresamos nuestra preocupación por la solidez de la metodología utilizada por las principales agencias de calificación crediticia. Ponemos de relieve que es necesario aumentar la transparencia de esas agencias y la competencia entre ellas, a fin de evitar las tendencias oligopolísticas y sus efectos negativos. Reiteramos que la evaluación inadecuada de la solvencia de los deudores puede generar o exacerbar las crisis y, con ello, aumentar la vulnerabilidad del sistema financiero. Es necesario proseguir los debates en las Naciones Unidas y otros foros sobre el papel de las agencias de calificación crediticia, con miras a proponer políticas concretas que permitan reducir la dependencia que se tiene de esas agencias mejorando su supervisión y aumentando la transparencia y la competencia mediante el establecimiento de mecanismos de evaluación independientes. Gobernanza económica mundial 138. Afirmamos que la actual crisis financiera y económica mundial y sus consecuencias para el desarrollo han puesto de relieve las deficiencias y los fracasos de la gobernanza económica mundial, en particular en el seno de las instituciones financieras internacionales, y la necesidad urgente de que la comunidad internacional dé una respuesta global, universal e integrada. Observamos con profunda preocupación que siete años después del inicio de la crisis mundial ha habido pocos progresos para fortalecer los aspectos sistémicos, reglamentarios y estructurales del sistema financiero mundial. Además, persiste la falta de participación de los países en desarrollo en general en las cuestiones económicas mundiales y la gobernanza; esto es motivo de grave preocupación porque el funcionamiento del sistema mundial afecta a todos los países, y este déficit democrático tiene consecuencias aún más graves para los países en desarrollo cuando la economía mundial se está desacelerando o en recesión. 139. Exhortamos firmemente a la comunidad internacional a que corrija el déficit democrático en la gobernanza económica mundial y proporcione a los países en desarrollo el lugar que legítimamente les corresponde y participación en la gobernanza y la adopción de decisiones en todas las instituciones y foros donde se realicen debates y se adopten decisiones sobre cuestiones económicas y financieras mundiales. 140. Afirmamos que la labor para reformar la estructura financiera internacional se debería por tanto reforzar seriamente y coordinar a nivel internacional, y debería conducir a la plena participación de los países en desarrollo en la adopción de decisiones y el establecimiento de normas en los ámbitos financiero y económico internacionales. Pedimos una reforma amplia de las instituciones de Bretton Woods, incluido el fortalecimiento del poder de voto de los países en desarrollo en un plazo estipulado, a fin de lograr mayor equidad entre países desarrollados y países en desarrollo y eliminar todo tipo de condiciones relacionadas con la ayuda. 141. Pedimos que se complete con urgencia la reformar de la fórmula de cálculo de las cuotas que hizo el FMI en 2010 para garantizar que las cuotas y la gobernanza del FMI reflejen mejor el peso relativo de los países emergentes y en desarrollo en la economía mundial. Sin embargo, una redistribución del derecho de voto solo para reflejar la realidad no resolverá los problemas estructurales de inestabilidad financiera y de falta de liquidez que necesitan solucionar los países en desarrollo para generar los niveles necesarios de crecimiento y desarrollo sostenibles. Además, la reforma debería abarcar la creación de liquidez, en particular la mejora de los derechos especiales de giro para los países en desarrollo. El FMI debe responder a las necesidades de los países en desarrollo en el ámbito financiero de manera más equilibrada y flexible, sin imponer condiciones procíclicas y respetando su necesidad de un margen normativo adecuado. Además, el personal de nivel superior de las instituciones de Bretton Woods debería designarse en función de sus méritos individuales mediante un proceso de selección abierto y justo. Mientras el FMI no refleje las nuevas realidades de la economía mundial y se siga designando a su Director General mediante un proceso carente de transparencia, se seguirá poniendo en entredicho su legitimidad. 142. Destacamos la necesidad de celebrar una conferencia internacional de seguimiento de la financiación para el desarrollo en 2015 para examinar la aplicación del Consenso de Monterrey y la Declaración de Doha con el fin de contribuir al proceso de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015. 143. Al tiempo que respetamos los propósitos y principios de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y el carácter intergubernamental de la Organización, reconocemos la importante función de las Naciones Unidas al constituir un foro intergubernamental, incluso por medio de conferencias y cumbres internacionales, para el diálogo universal y el consenso sobre los retos mundiales, con la debida participación de los interesados pertinentes. 144. Reafirmamos la posición central que ocupa la Asamblea General en su calidad de principal órgano de deliberación, adopción de políticas y representación de las Naciones Unidas, así como la función de la Asamblea en los asuntos mundiales de interés para la comunidad internacional, como establece la Carta de las Naciones Unidas. Fortalecimiento y reorientación de las Naciones Unidas 145. Reafirmamos nuestro compromiso de aumentar la participación de los países en desarrollo en los órganos de adopción de decisiones de las instituciones multilaterales a fin de que sean más acordes con la realidad geopolítica actual. 146. Subrayamos la importancia de la función central de las Naciones Unidas en la gobernanza económica mundial, que tiene por objeto mejorar la asociación mundial para el desarrollo, con miras a crear un entorno mundial propicio y favorable para el logro del desarrollo sostenible y asegurar la estabilidad financiera y económica. En este contexto, la Asamblea General y un Consejo Económico y Social fortalecido podrían actuar para mitigar los efectos de la crisis financiera y económica internacional y garantizar el derecho de los países en desarrollo a un margen normativo para el desarrollo sostenible. 147. Destacamos que el fortalecimiento del sistema de las Naciones Unidas y de su función en la cooperación internacional en pro del desarrollo es fundamental para aprovechar las oportunidades y afrontar los problemas resultantes del proceso de globalización, tanto en la actualidad como en el futuro. Reconocemos que es preciso que las Naciones Unidas mejoren sus medios y capacidades para cumplir plenamente sus mandatos y asegurar la ejecución eficaz de sus programas en el ámbito del desarrollo social y económico. A ese respecto, instamos al Secretario General a que siga reforzando el componente de desarrollo en toda la Organización, incluida su Cuenta para el Desarrollo. 148. Instamos a los países desarrollados a que demuestren una voluntad política genuina a fin de que en el proceso de reforma de las Naciones Unidas, incluido el fortalecimiento y la revitalización de la Asamblea General como emblema de la soberanía global, pueda mejorar sus medios y capacidades para desempeñar plenamente sus mandatos y asegurar la ejecución efectiva de su programa en los ámbitos social, ambiental y de desarrollo económico. 149. Destacamos que el fortalecimiento del sistema de las Naciones Unidas y de su función en la cooperación internacional en pro del desarrollo es fundamental para aprovechar las oportunidades y afrontar los problemas resultantes del proceso de globalización, tanto en la actualidad como en el futuro. En este contexto, expresamos nuestra preocupación por el creciente desequilibrio entre las cuotas y las contribuciones voluntarias en los proyectos de presupuesto por programas de la Organización. Destacamos también que el nivel de recursos que apruebe la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas debe ser suficiente para que todos los programas y actividades encomendados puedan ejecutarse íntegra y eficazmente. 150. Reafirmamos que ninguna iniciativa de reforma de la Secretaría y la administración, inclusive de los procesos presupuestarios, debe tener como propósito alterar el carácter intergubernamental, multilateral e internacional de la Organización, sino el de reforzar la capacidad de los Estados Miembros para cumplir su función de supervisión y vigilancia, y que el examen y la aprobación previos por los Estados Miembros son indispensables en todos los casos en que las medidas que hayan de aplicarse guarden relación con las prerrogativas de la Asamblea General, y a este respecto, recordamos la resolución 66/257. Reiteramos también la necesidad de aumentar la representación de los países en desarrollo y la representación de las mujeres de los países en desarrollo, en particular en las categorías superiores, y de mejorar la distribución geográfica en la Secretaría y aumentar la transparencia en el proceso de contratación. 151. Pedimos que continúen los esfuerzos por reformar las Naciones Unidas, incluida la revitalización de la Asamblea General y una reforma amplia del Consejo de Seguridad, que correspondan a los intereses colectivos de los países en desarrollo. 152. Expresamos preocupación por los recortes presupuestarios que afectan negativamente la ejecución de los mandatos aprobados por los órganos intergubernamentales de las Naciones Unidas, en particular en el componente de desarrollo, y el creciente desequilibrio entre las cuotas y las contribuciones voluntarias. 153. Pedimos una mayor transparencia, rendición de cuentas y supervisión por parte de los Estados Miembros respecto de las contribuciones voluntarias y los recursos extrapresupuestarios. Es importante que los recursos provenientes de las contribuciones voluntarias y los recursos extrapresupuestarios se utilicen para apoyar todas las prioridades acordadas por los Estados Miembros y se empleen estrictamente de conformidad con el Reglamento Financiero y Reglamentación Financiera Detallada de la Organización convenidos intergubernamentalmente. 154. Recalcamos la función central de las Naciones Unidas en la gobernanza económica mundial como foro multilateral verdaderamente universal e inclusivo, con una legitimidad incuestionable, poder de convocatoria y marcos normativos. Ponemos de relieve el importante papel que debería desempeñar la Asamblea General en el nombramiento del Secretario General de las Naciones Unidas, previa recomendación del Consejo de Seguridad de conformidad con el Artículo 97 de la Carta. En ese sentido, destacamos que el proceso de selección del Secretario General debería incluir a todos los Estados Miembros y ser más transparente. Además, consideramos que la rotación regional, así como el respeto de la representación geográfica equitativa, deberían tenerse en cuenta durante los procesos de selección y nombramiento. 155. Reconocemos también la importancia de aumentar el número de nacionales de países en desarrollo en los niveles superiores de la Secretaría, en particular en el Grupo Superior de Gestión. Transferencia de tecnología, ciencia e innovación para el desarrollo 156. Creemos que la integración de la ciencia, los conocimientos y la integración de la tecnología y la innovación deben ser instrumentos para promover la paz y el desarrollo sostenible de las personas, su bienestar y felicidad, y que, por tanto, deben estar orientados a promover el empoderamiento de los pobres, la erradicación de la pobreza y el hambre, la promoción de la solidaridad y la complementariedad entre y dentro de los pueblos para que puedan vivir bien en armonía con la Madre Tierra. 157. Expresamos nuestra preocupación por que la ciencia, la tecnología y la innovación puedan ser utilizadas indebidamente como instrumentos para limitar y socavar la soberanía de los países, el desarrollo sostenible y la erradicación de la pobreza. 158. Pedimos que se ponga fin a la utilización de tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones, incluidas las redes sociales, en contravención del derecho internacional y en detrimento de cualquier Estado, en particular los miembros del Grupo de los 77 o sus ciudadanos. 159. Reafirmamos que la tecnología es esencial para hacer frente a los problemas de desarrollo en una amplia variedad de cuestiones, como la alimentación y la agricultura, el agua y el saneamiento, el cambio climático, la energía, la industria y la gestión de productos químicos y de desechos. La transferencia de tecnología, la integración de la tecnología y el desarrollo y la promoción de tecnologías endógenas son importantes para que los países en desarrollo generen crecimiento económico de manera ecológicamente sostenible. Exhortamos a los países desarrollados a cumplir sus compromisos de transferir tecnología a los países en desarrollo y facilitar el acceso a tecnología en condiciones favorables, incluso en condiciones de favor y preferenciales, para que los países en desarrollo puedan optar a una vía de desarrollo más sostenible. 160. Es fundamental que los países desarrollados se vuelvan a comprometer con el objetivo de la transferencia de tecnología como uno de los principales componentes, junto con las finanzas, el desarrollo de la capacidad y el comercio, de la provisión de medios de realización del desarrollo sostenible para los países en desarrollo, y que tomen medidas para zanjar la brecha tecnológica. Pedimos la pronta creación por el sistema de las Naciones Unidas de un mecanismo de facilitación de la tecnología que promueva el desarrollo, la transferencia y la difusión de tecnologías limpias y ambientalmente racionales, incluidas tecnologías de combustibles fósiles menos contaminantes. 161. Pedimos que las reglamentaciones y las políticas sobre la propiedad intelectual se incluyan en un marco de desarrollo, en virtud del cual los derechos de propiedad intelectual se orienten hacia la promoción de un desarrollo social, económico y ambiental equilibrado. En este sentido, apoyamos las medidas adoptadas por los países en desarrollo para promover la aplicación de las recomendaciones adoptadas en el marco de la Agenda de la Organización Mundial de la Propiedad Intelectual (OMPI) para el Desarrollo de 2007. Reiteramos nuestro llamamiento en el párrafo 8 vii) del Plan de Acción de Doha de 2005, aprobado en la Segunda Cumbre del Grupo de los 77, de que la OMPI siga incluyendo en sus planes y actividades futuros, entre otras cosas, asesoramiento jurídico, una dimensión de desarrollo que abarque la promoción del desarrollo y el acceso de todos al conocimiento, el establecimiento de normas que favorezcan el desarrollo, la armonización con las normas del Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica, el establecimiento de principios que favorezcan el desarrollo y la transferencia y difusión de tecnología. 162. También reiteramos que el Acuerdo sobre los Aspectos de los Derechos de Propiedad Intelectual Relacionados con el Comercio (ADPIC) de la OMC contiene medidas de flexibilidad y que los Estados en desarrollo miembros de la OMC tienen derecho a utilizarlas, como se confirmó en la Declaración Ministerial de la OMC de 2001 relativa al Acuerdo sobre los ADPIC y la Salud Pública, y apoyamos el uso de esas disposiciones que prevén flexibilidad en nuestros países con el fin de promover la salud, la educación y el desarrollo económico y social. Observamos con gran interés y aprecio que algunos países en desarrollo han hecho uso con éxito de algunas medidas de flexibilidad de los ADPIC para promover el uso de medicamentos genéricos, que tienen menor costo y, por tanto, aumentan en gran medida el acceso a medicamentos a precios asequibles. Rechazamos los intentos de cualquier país desarrollado o de cualesquiera intereses comerciales de presionar a los países en desarrollo a fin de que no ejerzan su derecho a hacer uso de las medidas de flexibilidad del Acuerdo ADPIC para fines sociales y de desarrollo, y expresamos nuestra solidaridad con los países en desarrollo que han sido objeto de presiones de esa índole. 163. Destacamos la necesidad de proteger los conocimientos de los países en desarrollo, los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades locales respecto a los recursos genéticos, la biodiversidad y los conocimientos tradicionales, en particular de los intentos constantes de personas o empresas de patentar esos recursos y conocimientos sin la aprobación de los países, los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades de que se trate. 164. Pedimos que se intensifiquen las medidas de nuestros negociadores y encargados de formular políticas para establecer mecanismos jurídicos a nivel internacional o nacional a fin de prevenir la biopiratería exigiendo la divulgación del país de origen y de pruebas de acuerdos de participación en los beneficios por los solicitantes de esas patentes. Pedimos también disposiciones firmes y mecanismos eficaces para la transferencia de tecnología, en particular el tratamiento adecuado de la propiedad intelectual, en el régimen internacional relativo al cambio climático en la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático. Comercio 165. Creemos que el comercio en el contexto de políticas y normas apropiadas puede ser un instrumento importante para el desarrollo económico. Debido a la crisis financiera y económica mundial que continúa, se ha producido un declive del comercio que ha tenido graves efectos en muchos países en desarrollo a causa del descenso de los ingresos de las exportaciones, las barreras comerciales y los subsidios que distorsionan el comercio en los países en desarrollo, y el acceso restringido a la financiación del comercio y la disminución de las inversiones en la diversificación de la producción y en la promoción de las exportaciones y sigue siendo motivo de preocupación. Es esencial establecer y mantener un sistema comercial multilateral universal, justo, basado en normas, abierto, favorable al desarrollo, no discriminatorio, inclusivo y equitativo que contribuya al crecimiento, al desarrollo sostenible y al empleo, en particular en los países en desarrollo. 166. Pedimos que concluya oportuna y satisfactoriamente la Ronda de Doha de negociaciones comerciales multilaterales, que debe atenerse plenamente a su mandato en materia de desarrollo y estar centrada en las necesidades y prioridades de los países en desarrollo. Tras la Conferencia Ministerial de la OMC celebrada en Bali en 2013, pedimos un proceso de negociación inclusivo y transparente y que se dé prioridad a los intereses y problemas de los países en desarrollo en el programa posterior a Bali. Vemos con preocupación que algunos países desarrollados miembros de la OMC tienen más interés en obtener acceso a los mercados de los países en desarrollo, pero no están dispuestos a adoptar medidas adecuadas para eliminar o reducir el proteccionismo en su sector de la agricultura ni a facilitar más acceso a los mercados a los países en desarrollo. 167. Reiteramos que los países desarrollados deben proporcionar una asistencia técnica y una creación de capacidad relacionadas con el comercio eficaces, financiadas adecuadamente y adaptadas a las necesidades y las limitaciones específicas de los países en desarrollo, en particular mediante el Marco Integrado Mejorado de la OMC, para abordar las limitaciones de los países menos adelantados respecto de la infraestructura y la capacidad productiva relacionadas con la oferta y el comercio. Asimismo, es fundamental que los países en desarrollo tengan acceso a asistencia financiera y técnica para desarrollar su capacidad a fin de aplicar efectivamente el nuevo Acuerdo sobre Facilitación del Comercio de la OMC. En este contexto, debe prestarse especial atención, entre otros elementos, a los proyectos y programas orientados a desarrollar y fortalecer corredores para reducir los costos del tránsito internacional. 168. Ponemos de relieve la importancia de facilitar la adhesión a la OMC. El proceso de adhesión debe acelerarse sin impedimentos políticos y de manera expedita y transparente para los países en desarrollo, en plena conformidad con las normas de la OMC. Esto contribuiría a la integración rápida y plena de los países en desarrollo en el sistema comercial multilateral. 169. Creemos que las normas comerciales, en la OMC o en los acuerdos de comercio bilaterales y regionales, deberían permitir que los países en desarrollo dispongan de suficiente margen normativo para que puedan hacer uso de instrumentos y medidas de políticas necesarios para su desarrollo económico y social. Reiteramos nuestra petición de que se fortalezca de manera efectiva el trato especial y diferenciado y los principios y las disposiciones de la OMC que no conlleven una reciprocidad plena a fin de ampliar el margen normativo de los países en desarrollo y permitirles beneficiarse más del sistema comercial multilateral. También pedimos que los acuerdos bilaterales de comercio e inversión entre países desarrollados y países en desarrollo tengan un trato especial y diferenciado suficiente para los países en desarrollo para que puedan conservar un margen normativo adecuado para el desarrollo social y económico. Migración 170. Consideramos que el nexo entre la migración y el desarrollo deben abordarse de manera integral, teniendo en cuenta las dimensiones económica, social y ambiental e incluir una perspectiva cultural y humana. Reconocemos la necesidad de abordar esta cuestión mediante la cooperación y el diálogo internacionales, regionales o bilaterales y a través de un enfoque amplio, equilibrado, coordinado y consistente, reconociendo las funciones y responsabilidades de los países de origen, tránsito y destino en la promoción y la protección efectivas de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de todos los migrantes y sus familiares, especialmente los de las mujeres y los niños, independientemente de su situación migratoria. 171. Observamos que a pesar de los progresos logrados en los debates, el diálogo y la cooperación a nivel internacional, la migración aún no se reflejaba adecuadamente en los marcos de desarrollo, los programas de desarrollo y las políticas sectoriales tanto nacionales como mundiales. Por tanto, estamos explorando la posibilidad de una convención jurídicamente vinculante sobre la migración y el desarrollo para mejorar la gobernanza de la migración internacional, proteger y promover los derechos humanos de los migrantes y su contribución al desarrollo, independientemente de su situación migratoria. 172. Reconocemos la importante función que desempeñan los migrantes como asociados en el desarrollo de los países de origen, tránsito y destino y la necesidad de mejorar la protección de todos los derechos humanos y libertades fundamentales de los trabajadores migratorios y sus familiares. También destacamos la necesidad de seguir examinando el reconocimiento de las calificaciones y competencias de los migrantes y su acceso a servicios financieros de bajo costo para las remesas. Cambio climático 173. Afirmamos que la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático es el principal foro internacional intergubernamental para negociar la respuesta mundial al cambio climático. En este sentido, destacamos que la respuesta internacional al cambio climático debe respetar plenamente los principios, disposiciones y objetivo último de la Convención, en particular los principios de equidad y de responsabilidades comunes pero diferenciadas y las capacidades respectivas. 174. Reiteramos que la consecución del objetivo último de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático requerirá reforzar el régimen multilateral basado en normas en virtud de la Convención, y por tanto, reafirmamos además la importancia de continuar las negociaciones sobre el cambio climático en el marco de la Convención de conformidad con sus principios y disposiciones, y aprobar en 2015 un protocolo, otro instrumento jurídico o una conclusión acordada con fuerza legal en el marco de la Convención aplicable a todas las partes. 175. Recordamos que el cambio climático es uno de los problemas mundiales más graves de nuestro tiempo. Recalcamos que los países en desarrollo siguen siendo los que más sufren los efectos adversos del cambio climático, el aumento de la frecuencia e intensidad de los fenómenos meteorológicos extremos y las consecuencias de las medidas de respuesta, a pesar de que son los que menos contribuyen al cambio climático. En consecuencia, pedimos a los países desarrollados que encabecen la respuesta al cambio climático. El cambio climático pone en peligro no solo las perspectivas de desarrollo de los países en desarrollo y su logro del desarrollo sostenible, sino también la propia existencia y supervivencia de los países y las sociedades. 176. Reconocemos que los países de baja altitud y otros pequeños países insulares, los países en desarrollo con zonas costeras bajas, zonas áridas y semiáridas o zonas expuestas a inundaciones, sequía y desertificación, y los países en desarrollo con ecosistemas montañosos frágiles, son particularmente vulnerables a los efectos adversos del cambio climático. 177. Reafirmamos la importancia de la aplicación del mecanismo de Varsovia para las pérdidas y los daños relacionados con las repercusiones del cambio climático, aprobado en el 19º período de sesiones de la Conferencia de las Partes en la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático, celebrada en Varsovia del 11 al 23 de noviembre de 2013 (decisión 2/CP.19). Reconocemos también la necesidad urgente de adoptar medidas concretas en este año, antes de la celebración del 20º período de sesiones de la Conferencia de las Partes, que tendrá lugar en Lima, para la puesta en marcha inmediata del mecanismo. 178. Hacemos hincapié en que los países desarrollados, habida cuenta de su responsabilidad histórica, deben tomar las riendas a la hora de abordar ese reto acogiéndose a los principios y las disposiciones de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático, en particular los principios de responsabilidades comunes pero diferenciadas y las capacidades respectivas y de equidad, y proporcionar apoyo financiero y tecnológico a los países en desarrollo en forma transparente, adecuada y previsible con arreglo a una modalidad de vigilancia, presentación de informes y verificación. 179. Reiteramos que la medida en que los países en desarrollo lleven a la práctica efectivamente sus compromisos en virtud de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático dependerá de la manera en que los países desarrollados lleven a la práctica efectivamente sus compromisos en virtud de la Convención relativos a los recursos financieros y la transferencia de tecnología y tengan plenamente en cuenta que el desarrollo económico y social y la erradicación de la pobreza son las prioridades primeras y absolutas de los países en desarrollo. 180. Destacamos la necesidad de resolver urgentemente la cuestión del establecimiento de objetivos deliberadamente poco ambiciosos, y manifestamos preocupación por la falta de cumplimiento de los compromisos por los países desarrollados. Para hacer frente a esas dificultades, la atención no debe limitarse solamente a la mitigación sino abordar también las lagunas en materia de financiación, tecnología y apoyo para el desarrollo de capacidad, equilibradas con un enfoque centrado en la adaptación al cambio climático. Ponemos de relieve que los países desarrollados deben asumir compromisos de mitigación firmes y ambiciosos, con metas cuantitativas ambiciosas respecto de la reducción y la limitación de emisiones, de acuerdo con los niveles dictados por la ciencia y establecidos en la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático. 181. Reiteramos la urgencia de acelerar el proceso de puesta en marcha del Fondo Verde para el Clima y de su pronta capitalización, y exhortamos a los países desarrollados a alcanzar el objetivo de movilizar 100.000 millones de dólares cada año para 2020 a fin de atender a las necesidades de los países en desarrollo. 182. Afirmamos nuestro apoyo para el éxito de la reunión que se celebrará en la República Bolivariana de Venezuela antes del 20º período de sesiones de la Conferencia de las Partes que se celebrará en Lima, y reafirmamos la necesidad de lograr progresos en las negociaciones para alcanzar un acuerdo ambicioso, equilibrado, justo y eficaz en el marco de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático, de conformidad con sus principios y disposiciones, que se acordará en 2015 y entrará en vigor en 2020 que realmente contribuya a la estabilización del sistema climático. Biodiversidad 183. Reafirmamos el reconocimiento que figura en el documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible acerca de la gravedad de la pérdida mundial de biodiversidad y la degradación de los ecosistemas, y ponemos de relieve que socavan el desarrollo mundial, afectan a la seguridad alimentaria y la nutrición, el abastecimiento de agua y el acceso al agua, la salud de los pobres del medio rural y de los pueblos de todo el mundo, incluidas las generaciones presentes y futuras. Esto resalta la importancia de conservar la biodiversidad, reforzar la conectividad del hábitat y aumentar la resiliencia de los ecosistemas. 184. Reconocemos la importancia del papel de las medidas colectivas de los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades locales para proteger, utilizar y conservar la biodiversidad. Reafirmamos también que los conocimientos, innovaciones y prácticas tradicionales de los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades locales aportan una contribución importante a la conservación y uso sostenible de la biodiversidad y que su aplicación más amplia puede apoyar el bienestar social y los medios de vida sostenibles. Reconocemos además que a menudo los pueblos indígenas y las comunidades locales son los que más directamente dependen de la biodiversidad y los ecosistemas, y por tanto, con frecuencia son los más inmediatamente afectados por su pérdida y degradación. 185. Acogemos con beneplácito los importantes resultados de la 11ª reunión de la Conferencia de las Partes en el Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica, celebrada en Hyderabad (India) en octubre de 2012, en particular el compromiso de duplicar las corrientes financieras internacionales relacionadas con la biodiversidad hacia los países en desarrollo para 2015 y como mínimo mantener ese nivel hasta 2020 a fin de contribuir a alcanzar los tres objetivos del Convenio. Exhortamos también a las Partes en el Convenio a examinar los avances a ese respecto en la 12ª reunión de la Conferencia de las Partes con miras a adoptar una meta definitiva para la movilización de recursos. 186. Acogemos con beneplácito la reunión informativa conjunta celebrada en 2013 por el Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Medio Ambiente, la OMPI, la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura, el PNUD, la UNCTAD, la secretaría del Tratado Internacional sobre los Recursos Fitogenéticos para la Alimentación y la Agricultura y la secretaría del Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica sobre la aplicación de los objetivos del Convenio, incluidas las medidas adoptadas para promover el acceso a los recursos genéticos y la distribución justa y equitativa de los beneficios derivados de su utilización y los conocimientos tradicionales conexos. Señalamos que se deberían alentar interacciones similares, reconociendo los respectivos mandatos de las organizaciones participantes, y exhortamos a todos los Estados Miembros, en particular a los países desarrollados, a que aceleren el proceso de ratificación del Protocolo de Nagoya sobre acceso a los recursos genéticos y participación justa y equitativa en los beneficios que se deriven de su utilización al Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica. 187. Observamos con profunda preocupación el aumento sin precedentes de la caza furtiva y el comercio ilícito de vida silvestre y sus productos en todas las regiones, en particular de colmillos de elefante y cuernos de rinoceronte. Destacamos que esa tendencia es perjudicial para el equilibrio ecológico, promueve la delincuencia dentro y a través de las fronteras y se le debe poner fin con urgencia a fin de evitar invertir decenios de ganancias con la conservación. Por tanto, condenamos enérgicamente la caza furtiva y los delitos relacionados con el tráfico ilícito de fauna y flora silvestres, y acordamos aumentar la cooperación internacional de conformidad con la Convención sobre el Comercio Internacional de Especies Amenazadas de Fauna y Flora Silvestres y otros acuerdos pertinentes para poner freno a esas prácticas, hacer frente a la demanda y la oferta de la flora y la fauna silvestres y sus productos, y aumentar la capacidad de las comunidades afectadas por ese tráfico para promover oportunidades de medios de vida sostenibles. Bosques 188. Resaltamos los beneficios sociales, económicos y ambientales que tienen los bosques para las personas y las contribuciones de la gestión forestal sostenible al objetivo del desarrollo sostenible. Apoyamos las políticas intersectoriales e interinstitucionales que promuevan la gestión forestal sostenible (Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible) y reconocemos también la importancia de los enfoques holísticos, integrales y alternativos para la gestión forestal sostenible elaborados en el marco de las negociaciones sobre el cambio climático. 189. Observamos el resultado del décimo período de sesiones del Foro de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Bosques, celebrado en Estambul (Turquía), del 8 al 19 de abril de 2013, y recalcamos la importancia de los cuatro objetivos mundiales sobre los bosques para la comunidad internacional en su conjunto, en particular para los países en desarrollo. El cuarto objetivo mundial es particularmente pertinente para los países en desarrollo, ya que señala la necesidad de invertir la disminución de la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo y movilizar recursos financieros nuevos y adicionales para aplicar una gestión forestal sostenible. Para cumplir el cuarto objetivo mundial es fundamental respetar el principio de responsabilidades comunes pero diferenciadas entre los países desarrollados y en desarrollo. A este respecto, instamos a los países desarrollados a ejercer una voluntad política firme y la flexibilidad necesaria para contribuir a lograr la gestión forestal sostenible. 190. Pedimos que se establezca un nuevo fondo silvícola mundial que esté en consonancia con los principios del desarrollo sostenible. Consideramos que es necesario a fin de canalizar la financiación necesaria para los países en desarrollo a fin de gestionar de manera sostenible sus bosques. Desertificación, degradación de las tierras y sequía 191. Reafirmamos que la desertificación, la degradación de las tierras y la sequía son motivos de grave preocupación para los países en desarrollo. Por tanto, es urgente que se adopten medidas internacionales encaminadas a hacer frente a esos problemas. Ponemos de relieve la gran importancia de la Convención de las Naciones Unidas de Lucha contra la Desertificación en los Países Afectados por Sequía Grave o Desertificación, en Particular en África, destacando que la desertificación, la degradación de las tierras y la sequía socavan las tres dimensiones del desarrollo sostenible. Reiteramos que hacer frente a la desertificación, la degradación de las tierras y la sequía permite a los países abordar varios retos en materia de política de escala mundial, como la seguridad alimentaria, la adaptación al cambio climático y la migración forzada. En este contexto, observamos la realización del 11º período de sesiones de la Conferencia de las Partes en la Convención de Lucha contra la Desertificación, celebrado en Windhoek del 16 al 27 de septiembre de 2013. 192. Reiteramos la necesidad de cooperar mediante el intercambio de información sobre el clima y meteorológica y los sistemas de pronóstico y alerta temprana relacionados con la desertificación, la degradación de las tierras y la sequía, así como sobre las tormentas de polvo y arena, a nivel mundial, regional y subregional. En este sentido, invitamos a los Estados y a las organizaciones competentes a que cooperen en el intercambio de la información y los sistemas de pronóstico y alerta temprana conexos. Océanos y mares 193. Destacamos la importancia de la conservación y el uso sostenible de los océanos y mares y sus recursos para el desarrollo sostenible, en particular debido a su contribución a la erradicación de la pobreza, el desarrollo económico sostenido, la seguridad alimentaria, la creación de medios de vida sostenibles y trabajo decente, así como de la protección de la biodiversidad y el medio marino y las medidas para hacer frente a los efectos del cambio climático. Por tanto, nos comprometemos a proteger y restablecer la salud, la productividad y la resiliencia de los océanos y ecosistemas marinos, mantener su biodiversidad, promover su conservación y uso sostenible para las generaciones presentes y futuras y lograr las tres dimensiones del desarrollo sostenible. Gobernanza de Internet, incluido el derecho a la intimidad 194. Vemos con consternación que algunos países han realizado recientemente actividades de vigilancia o de interceptación de las comunicaciones extensas, arbitrarias e ilegales, incluidas la vigilancia o la interceptación extraterritoriales de comunicaciones y la recopilación de datos personales, incluso a gran escala, de personas e instituciones de otros países, en particular de dirigentes políticos, altos funcionarios y diversos departamentos gubernamentales y organismos, así como de ciudadanos. Pedimos que se ponga fin a esas actividades, que violan el derecho humano a la intimidad de las personas y tienen efectos negativos en las relaciones entre los países. En este sentido, pedimos que entidades intergubernamentales examinen y revisen el uso de las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones a fin de asegurar que se ajusten plenamente al derecho internacional, incluido el derecho de los derechos humanos, de conformidad con los propósitos y principios de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas. 195. Acogemos con beneplácito la celebración de NETmundial, la Reunión Global de Múltiples Partes Interesadas sobre el Futuro de la Gobernanza de Internet, que tuvo lugar en São Paulo (Brasil), los días 23 y 24 de abril de 2014, y tomamos nota de su documento final. 196. Ponemos de relieve las importantes posibilidades que ofrecen las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones, incluidas las redes sociales y la infraestructura conexa, como medio para promover un mejor entendimiento entre las naciones y el logro de los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente. 197. Reconocemos al mismo tiempo que el uso ilegal de las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones tiene efectos negativos en las naciones y sus ciudadanos. En este sentido, expresamos nuestro firme rechazo a la utilización de las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones en violación del derecho internacional, incluido el derecho a la intimidad, y a toda medida de esta índole dirigida contra cualquier Estado Miembro, en particular un Estado miembro del Grupo de los 77. 198. Subrayamos además la importancia de velar por que la utilización de esas tecnologías sea plenamente compatible con los propósitos y principios de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y del derecho internacional, en particular los principios de soberanía, no injerencia en los asuntos internos y las normas internacionalmente reconocidas de la coexistencia civil entre los Estados. 199. En este sentido, observamos con preocupación la información publicada en medios de comunicación internacionales sobre los objetivos de la denominada red "ZunZuneo", que constituiría un uso ilícito de las nuevas tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones. 200. Por consiguiente, reiteramos nuestro compromiso de intensificar los esfuerzos internacionales dirigidos a salvaguardar el ciberespacio y promover su uso exclusivo para la consecución de fines pacíficos y como vehículo para contribuir al desarrollo económico y social, y resaltamos que la cooperación internacional, respetando plenamente los derechos humanos, es la única opción viable para fomentar los efectos positivos de las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones, evitar sus posibles efectos negativos, promover su uso con fines pacíficos y legítimos y garantizar que los avances científicos y tecnológicos tengan por objeto preservar la paz y promover el bienestar y el desarrollo de nuestras sociedades. Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio 201. Expresamos nuestro compromiso de intensificar los esfuerzos encaminados a alcanzar los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio antes de 2015 y de asumir un papel rector para dar forma a la agenda internacional para el desarrollo después de 2015. Exhortamos a la comunidad internacional a que redoble todos los esfuerzos para acelerar el cumplimiento de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio de aquí a 2015 mediante medidas concretas. 202. Observamos los progresos logrados hasta la fecha para alcanzar los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio, pero nos preocupan la desigualdad y las deficiencias en el logro y los enormes desafíos socioeconómicos y ambientales que persisten en los países en desarrollo. Reiteramos que los Objetivos siguen siendo fundamentales para atender las necesidades básicas de la población de los países en desarrollo, muchos de los cuales no están en condiciones de alcanzarlos para 2015. 203. Recalcamos el papel central que corresponde a la alianza mundial para el desarrollo y la importancia del octavo Objetivo de Desarrollo del Milenio para la consecución de todos los Objetivos, y que sin un apoyo internacional sustancial y cambios sistémicos, muchos países en desarrollo no lograrán alcanzar varios Objetivos para 2015. Exhortamos a la comunidad internacional a intensificar sus esfuerzos para que se proporcionen a los países en desarrollo mejores medios para progresar mediante una alianza mundial renovada basada en la búsqueda colectiva de medidas destinadas a erradicar la pobreza y las privaciones.
Desarrollo sostenible y Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible 204. Recordamos y reafirmamos la aseveración que hicieron los dirigentes mundiales en el documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible, titulado "El futuro que queremos", de que la erradicación de la pobreza es el mayor problema que afronta el mundo en la actualidad y una condición indispensable del desarrollo sostenible. 205. Reiteramos que erradicar la pobreza, modificar las modalidades de consumo y producción insostenibles y promover modalidades sostenibles, y disponer la protección y la ordenación de la base de recursos naturales del desarrollo económico y social son objetivos generales y requisitos indispensables para el desarrollo sostenible. Reafirmamos también que es necesario lograr el desarrollo sostenible promoviendo un crecimiento sostenido, inclusivo y equitativo, creando mayores oportunidades para todos, reduciendo las desigualdades, mejorando los niveles de vida básicos, fomentando el desarrollo social equitativo y la inclusión, y promoviendo la ordenación integrada y sostenible de los recursos naturales y los ecosistemas, que contribuye, entre otras cosas, al desarrollo económico, social y humano y facilita al mismo tiempo la conservación, la regeneración, el restablecimiento y la resiliencia de los ecosistemas frente a los problemas nuevos y en ciernes. 206. Destacamos que los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible deberían abordar y centrarse prioritariamente en la integración de las tres dimensiones del desarrollo sostenible (económica, social y ambiental), regirse por el documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible, respetar todos los Principios de Río y tener en cuenta las diferentes circunstancias, capacidades y prioridades nacionales. 207. Reafirmamos que el documento final de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible es la base de la labor del Grupo de Trabajo Abierto de la Asamblea General sobre los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible. Subrayamos que para avanzar en el logro del objetivo general de erradicar la pobreza es importante que los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible se basen en los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio y los complementen. 208. Destacamos que los avances en el cumplimiento de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio, los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible y la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 dependerán de la medida en que se cree un entorno internacional propicio que favorezca el desarrollo y se faciliten los medios de ejecución pertinentes a los países en desarrollo, en particular en las esferas de las finanzas, el comercio, la tecnología y la creación de capacidad. 209. Reafirmamos que los principios rectores del Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible deben basarse en todos los principios establecidos en las grandes cumbres y conferencias de las Naciones Unidas en las esferas económica, ambiental y social, teniendo en cuenta, entre otros, los enunciados en la Declaración de Río sobre el Medio Ambiente y el Desarrollo, el Programa 21 y el Plan de Aplicación de las Decisiones de la Cumbre Mundial sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible, y los derivados de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible (2012), la Conferencia Internacional sobre la Financiación para el Desarrollo (2002) y la Cumbre Mundial sobre Desarrollo Social (1995), y deben ajustarse al derecho internacional. El proceso y los resultados del Grupo de Trabajo Abierto de la Asamblea General sobre los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible deben respetar plenamente todos los Principios de Río, en particular el principio de la responsabilidad común pero diferenciada. Los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible deben contribuir a la plena aplicación de los resultados de todas las grandes cumbres en las esferas económica, social y ambiental. 210. Reafirmamos que reconocemos que el planeta Tierra y sus ecosistemas son nuestro hogar y que "Madre Tierra" es una expresión común en muchos países y regiones, y observamos que algunos países reconocen los derechos de la naturaleza en el contexto de la promoción del desarrollo sostenible. Estamos convencidos de que, para lograr un justo equilibrio entre las necesidades económicas, sociales y ambientales de las generaciones presentes y futuras, es necesario promover la armonía con la naturaleza. Pedimos que se adopte un enfoque holístico e integrado del desarrollo sostenible, que podría incluir, entre otras cosas, el reconocimiento por algunos países de los principios antes mencionados, que lleve a la humanidad a vivir en armonía con la naturaleza y que propicie la adopción de medidas para restablecer la salud y la integridad del ecosistema de la Tierra. 211. Acogemos con satisfacción el diálogo interactivo de la Asamblea General sobre la Armonía con la Naturaleza, celebrado el 22 de abril de 2013 con ocasión del Día Internacional de la Madre Tierra, en el que se examinaron diferentes enfoques económicos en el contexto del desarrollo sostenible a fin de promover una base más ética en la relación entre los seres humanos y la Tierra, así como la necesidad de fomentar el uso sostenible de los recursos naturales, teniendo en cuenta la importancia de estudiar la adopción y la aplicación de políticas que conformen estrategias nacionales de desarrollo que promuevan una mejor distribución de los beneficios y no se circunscriban a la mera producción de materias primas, de conformidad con lo dispuesto en la resolución 67/214 de la Asamblea General. 212. Recalcamos que el informe del Grupo de Trabajo Abierto de la Asamblea General sobre los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible debe ser el resultado de un proceso intergubernamental inclusivo. En consecuencia, reafirmamos nuestro compromiso de participar activamente en tales negociaciones. 213. Subrayamos la necesidad de definir medios de ejecución adecuados para todos y cada uno de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible, así como la necesidad de un objetivo de desarrollo sostenible dedicado expresamente al fortalecimiento de la alianza mundial para el desarrollo sostenible, con compromisos generales con respecto a los medios de ejecución y la cooperación internacional para el desarrollo sostenible. Agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 214. Reafirmamos la importancia fundamental de que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 se establezca en un proceso de negociación intergubernamental justo, transparente e inclusivo, según lo decidido en el acto especial de seguimiento de la labor realizada para lograr los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio celebrado en 2013. Destacamos que ese proceso de negociación intergubernamental deberá centrarse en sus modalidades y aspectos sustantivos de modo que se genere un documento final negociado y convenido que tenga plenamente en cuenta los resultados de los diversos procesos de seguimiento previstos por la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible y de las principales cumbres y conferencias relacionadas con los ámbitos social, económico y ambiental. 215. Recordando la afirmación hecha en la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible de que la erradicación de la pobreza es el mayor problema que afronta el mundo y una condición indispensable del desarrollo sostenible, hacemos hincapié en que la erradicación de la pobreza debe seguir siendo el objetivo central y conductor de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015. Estamos firmemente convencidos de que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 debe reforzar el compromiso de la comunidad internacional de erradicar la pobreza para 2030. 216. Subrayamos la necesidad de adoptar un enfoque coherente en lo que respecta a la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015, que refuerce el compromiso de la comunidad internacional de erradicar la pobreza e integrar las tres dimensiones del desarrollo sostenible de manera equilibrada, con la contribución del Grupo de Trabajo Abierto de la Asamblea General sobre los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible, el proceso de financiación para el desarrollo, el Comité Intergubernamental de Expertos en Financiación del Desarrollo Sostenible, el proceso para formular opciones con respecto a un mecanismo de las Naciones Unidas de facilitación de la tecnología y otros procesos pertinentes. 217. Reafirmamos que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 debe ajustarse plenamente a los Principios de Río, en particular al principio de la responsabilidad común pero diferenciada. 218. Subrayamos la importancia de fortalecer la alianza mundial para el desarrollo, que se ha de basar en objetivos cuantificados con plazos concretos, en consonancia con el octavo Objetivo de Desarrollo del Milenio y de conformidad con el principio de la responsabilidad común pero diferenciada en el marco de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015. La piedra angular de esta alianza sigue siendo la cooperación Norte-Sur, de la que la cooperación Sur-Sur y la cooperación triangular son un complemento útil. En consecuencia, los países desarrollados han de reafirmar su compromiso de intensificar la cooperación internacional y prestar un mayor apoyo a los países en desarrollo. Hacemos hincapié en la necesidad de que los países desarrollados cumplan urgentemente los compromisos de asistencia oficial para el desarrollo que han contraído de manera individual y colectiva, en particular la meta de destinar el 0,7% de su producto nacional bruto a la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo para el año 2015 y la meta de destinar entre el 0,15% y el 0,20% de su producto nacional bruto a la asistencia oficial para el desarrollo de los países menos adelantados. 219. Hacemos hincapié en que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 debe abordar de manera sustantiva cuestiones relativas a la reforma de las instituciones de gobernanza económica mundial a fin de dar mayor voz y participación a los países en desarrollo en la adopción de decisiones en esas instituciones. Observamos también que los sistemas económicos, financieros y comerciales mundiales siguen estando desequilibrados, en detrimento de los países en desarrollo, y a este respecto destacamos la importancia de indicar, en la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015, las deficiencias y los desequilibrios de esos sistemas mundiales y de proponer medidas para mejorarlos con objeto de favorecer la agenda y los programas de desarrollo de los países en desarrollo. 220. Afirmamos la necesidad de un mecanismo sólido de aplicación de la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 que asegure la disponibilidad de recursos para el desarrollo para lograr los objetivos fijados. En este sentido, pedimos que se intensifique la financiación para el desarrollo, se establezcan y mejoren mecanismos de transferencia de tecnología y se potencien iniciativas para desarrollar la capacidad de los países en desarrollo. 221. Pedimos que se adopte un enfoque de rendición de cuentas responsable con respecto a las alianzas de las que formen parte las Naciones Unidas, en particular en lo referente a la participación del sector privado, la sociedad civil y entidades filantrópicas. A este respecto, reafirmamos que es preciso aumentar la transparencia, la coherencia y la sostenibilidad, así como la rendición de cuentas a los Estados Miembros en las alianzas de las Naciones Unidas, y destacamos la necesidad de que haya establecidos procedimientos para que los Estados Miembros examinen y aprueben este tipo de iniciativas en la Asamblea General a fin de preservar el carácter intergubernamental de las Naciones Unidas. 222. Hacemos hincapié en que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 debe ser una agenda para el desarrollo y en que, en este contexto, es importante promover el desarrollo económico, social y ambiental de manera integral, equilibrada y coordinada. Esta agenda debe tener un mayor alcance que los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio y abarcar las esferas, las cuestiones y los grupos de población que son fundamentales para lograr el desarrollo sostenible. 223. Destacamos también la importancia de que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015, si se pretende que sea de carácter global y universalmente aplicable a todos, respete plenamente el margen normativo en materia de desarrollo de los países en desarrollo, de forma que puedan recurrir a las medidas y los instrumentos normativos necesarios para poner en práctica sus políticas de erradicación de la pobreza y otros planes y programas de desarrollo. Destacamos también que la agenda para el desarrollo después de 2015 debe promover el crecimiento económico rápido, sostenido e inclusivo en los países en desarrollo como requisito fundamental para erradicar la pobreza y el hambre y reducir las desigualdades dentro de los países y de un país a otro.
Parte V
Necesidades particulares de los países en desarrollo en situaciones especiales 224. Recordamos las necesidades especiales de África, único continente que no va camino de alcanzar los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente, incluidos los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio. Reconocemos que, si bien se está reanudando el crecimiento económico, es necesario apuntalar la recuperación, que es frágil y desigual, para hacer frente a los actuales efectos adversos de las múltiples crisis en el desarrollo y a las graves dificultades que suponen para la lucha contra la pobreza y el hambre, que podrían comprometer aún más el logro en África de los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente, incluidos los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio. 225. Expresamos profunda preocupación por el hecho de que no se ha cumplido plenamente el compromiso de duplicar la ayuda a África antes de 2010 formulado en la cumbre del Grupo de los Ocho celebrada en Gleneagles (Reino Unido) y, a este respecto, recalcamos la necesidad de avanzar con rapidez en el cumplimiento de esos compromisos y los asumidos por otros donantes de aumentar la ayuda a los países africanos por medios diversos, entre ellos la aportación de nuevos recursos adicionales, la transferencia de tecnología y la creación de capacidad, y de contribuir a su desarrollo sostenible. Pedimos que se siga prestando apoyo a las iniciativas de desarrollo de África, como la Agenda 2063 (plan estratégico y marco de prioridades para el desarrollo socioeconómico a escala continental), la Nueva Alianza para el Desarrollo de África y el Programa de Desarrollo de la Infraestructura en África. Por otro lado, acogemos con satisfacción el apoyo prestado a África por algunos países en desarrollo mediante programas de cooperación Sur-Sur y cooperación triangular. 226. Manifestamos preocupación ante la situación de los países menos adelantados, que sigue deteriorándose como consecuencia de las múltiples crisis mundiales actuales, que se exacerban mutuamente. Es evidente que la actual crisis financiera y económica mundial está socavando el desarrollo en los países menos adelantados. Como consecuencia del retroceso en los modestos avances en materia de desarrollo conseguidos a lo largo de los años por estos países, está aumentando el número de personas abocadas a la pobreza extrema en su territorio. Muchos países menos adelantados siguen estando lejos de alcanzar los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente, incluidos los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio. Hacemos hincapié en la necesidad de llevar a la práctica de forma plena y efectiva los compromisos asumidos en el Programa de Acción en Favor de los Países Menos Adelantados para el Decenio 2011-2020. Subrayamos además la necesidad vital de hacer efectiva rápidamente una alianza mundial renovada y fortalecida para los países menos adelantados a fin de superar sus problemas estructurales, erradicar la pobreza, alcanzar los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente y ayudar a la mitad de los países menos adelantados a cumplir los criterios que les permitan salir de esa categoría para 2020. 227. Recordamos que las vulnerabilidades específicas y particulares de los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo han sido reconocidas por la comunidad internacional en varias reuniones de las Naciones Unidas, como por ejemplo las celebradas en Río de Janeiro (1992), Barbados (1994), Johannesburgo (2002) y Mauricio (2005), y señalamos con preocupación que no se han tomado suficientes medidas a nivel internacional para subsanar esas vulnerabilidades y apoyar con eficacia los esfuerzos de dichos Estados en pro del desarrollo sostenible. Recordamos que el cambio climático y la elevación del nivel del mar constituyen la mayor amenaza para la supervivencia y la viabilidad de los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo y para sus esfuerzos por lograr los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible, y hacemos un llamamiento a la comunidad internacional a que se comprometa a aumentar con carácter urgente la cooperación internacional en apoyo de dichos esfuerzos, en particular mediante el incremento de recursos financieros, el fomento de la capacidad, la transferencia de tecnología y conocimientos especializados, y una mayor participación de los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo en la toma de decisiones económicas a nivel internacional. Acogemos con beneplácito la decisión de convocar la tercera Conferencia Internacional sobre el Desarrollo Sostenible de los Pequeños Estados Insulares en Desarrollo, que se celebrará en 2014 en Apia, y pedimos que se aumenten las medidas de asistencia a los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo en la aplicación del Programa de Acción para el desarrollo sostenible de los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo y la Estrategia de Mauricio para la Ejecución del Programa de Acción para el desarrollo sostenible de los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo. Nos comprometemos a trabajar en pro de un resultado sólido para la Conferencia de Apia que sirva de apoyo a los pequeños Estados insulares en desarrollo en sus necesidades y aspiraciones en materia de desarrollo sostenible. 228. Reconocemos las necesidades y los desafíos especiales que afrontan los países en desarrollo sin litoral, causados por su falta de acceso territorial al mar, situación agravada por la lejanía de los mercados mundiales, y expresamos también nuestra preocupación por el hecho de que el crecimiento económico y el bienestar social de los países en desarrollo sin litoral siguen siendo muy vulnerables a las perturbaciones externas así como a los múltiples desafíos que enfrenta la comunidad internacional, como la crisis financiera y económica y los cambios climáticos. Hacemos hincapié en la necesidad de que la comunidad internacional aumente la asistencia para el desarrollo a los países en desarrollo sin litoral para ayudarles a subsanar sus vulnerabilidades, aumentar la resiliencia y adoptar una senda de desarrollo social y económico sostenible. Reafirmamos la necesidad de atender sin dilación las necesidades especiales de desarrollo y los desafíos que enfrentan los países en desarrollo sin litoral y de tránsito a través de su asociación genuina con el apoyo y cooperación suficientes de la comunidad internacional para la eficaz aplicación de las prioridades del Programa de Acción de Almaty y su programa sucesor. Acogemos con beneplácito la decisión de la Asamblea General de celebrar una conferencia de examen global decenal del Programa de Acción de Almaty en 2014 y exhortamos a la comunidad internacional a considerar con espíritu crítico las necesidades y los desafíos especiales que afrontan los países en desarrollo sin litoral y ayudar a establecer las prioridades de un marco más integrado y orientado hacia la acción común en favor de los países en desarrollo sin litoral para el próximo decenio. 229. Reconocemos que los países de ingresos medianos siguen afrontando importantes desafíos en materia de desarrollo y subrayamos que, a pesar de los recientes progresos logrados y los esfuerzos realizados por los países de ingresos medianos, el 75% de los pobres del mundo vive en esos países. La consecución de los objetivos de desarrollo convenidos internacionalmente, incluidos los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio, así como el logro del pleno empleo y la creación de puestos de trabajo para los jóvenes, la diversificación de sus economías y el desarrollo de las tecnologías siguen planteando enormes dificultades para los países de ingresos medianos. Hacemos hincapié en la creciente solidaridad y el papel desempeñado por los países de ingresos medianos en el ámbito de la cooperación Sur-Sur en apoyo de las iniciativas de desarrollo de otros países en desarrollo. Observamos también los resultados de la conferencia de alto nivel de los países de ingresos medianos, organizada por Costa Rica y la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo Industrial en junio de 2013. 230. Subrayamos la necesidad de que el sistema de las Naciones Unidas para el desarrollo se asegure de que aborda las distintas necesidades de los países de ingresos medianos en materia de desarrollo de una forma coordinada por medios como una evaluación precisa de las prioridades y necesidades nacionales de esos países, teniendo en cuenta la utilización de variables que vayan más allá de los criterios relativos a los ingresos per capita y reconociendo la naturaleza multidimensional del desarrollo y de la pobreza y a través de un apoyo adecuado, sistemático y mejor enfocado, de conformidad con los planes nacionales. 231. Reiteramos nuestro llamamiento para que Israel, la Potencia ocupante, se retire total e inmediatamente del Territorio Palestino Ocupado, incluida Jerusalén Oriental, y del Golán sirio ocupado hasta la línea existente el 4 de junio de 1967, así como del resto de territorios ocupados del Líbano. Reafirmamos nuestro apoyo a un proceso de paz en el Oriente Medio orientado a lograr una paz amplia, justa y duradera en la región, de conformidad con las resoluciones pertinentes de las Naciones Unidas, entre ellas las resoluciones del Consejo de Seguridad 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 425 (1978) y 1850 (2008) y el principio de territorio por paz. En este contexto, también reafirmamos nuestro apoyo a la Iniciativa de Paz Árabe, aprobada por el Consejo de la Liga de los Estados Árabes en marzo de 2002. 232. Hacemos hincapié en la necesidad de la pronta realización por el pueblo palestino de su derecho a la libre determinación y a la independencia de su Estado de Palestina a fin de hacer posible la estabilidad, la prosperidad y el desarrollo en pro de la consecución de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio (ODM), a los que tienen derecho todos los pueblos. Expresamos nuestro apoyo a los esfuerzos del pueblo palestino por lograr la independencia y, a ese respecto, celebramos el hecho de que el 23 de septiembre de 2011 el Estado de Palestina presentara la solicitud de ingresar en las Naciones Unidas como miembro de pleno derecho, y observamos la aprobación por la Asamblea General de la resolución 67/19, de 29 de noviembre de 2012, en que concedió a Palestina la condición de Estado observador no miembro en las Naciones Unidas. Seguimos prestando apoyo al proceso de admisión del Estado de Palestina como miembro de pleno derecho de las Naciones Unidas lo antes posible. Recordamos que 2014 fue declarado Año Internacional de Solidaridad con el Pueblo Palestino. 233. Condenamos la continuación de la ocupación militar israelí del territorio palestino, incluida Jerusalén Oriental, y las actividades ilegales que lleva a cabo la Potencia ocupante, que siguen provocando víctimas civiles, penurias socioeconómicas y humanitarias y destrucción de bienes, infraestructura y tierras agrícolas palestinos, y socavan la contigüidad, la unidad y la integridad del territorio. 234. Expresamos nuestra profunda preocupación por el empeoramiento de las condiciones sociales y económicas del pueblo palestino, particularmente en la Franja de Gaza asediada, como consecuencia de las prácticas ilegales de Israel, como la construcción de asentamientos y del muro y la imposición de un bloqueo y de cientos de puestos de control. Exhortamos a Israel, la Potencia ocupante, a que cese de inmediato todas las medidas ilegales que obstaculizan la economía y el desarrollo de Palestina, en particular, el bloqueo inhumano e ilegal impuesto a la Franja de Gaza y las restricciones impuestas a la circulación de personas y bienes, incluido el comercio en todo el Territorio Palestino Ocupado, con destino a él y desde él, y a que pague indemnizaciones por todos los daños causados a las propiedades, instituciones e infraestructura palestinas. Reiteramos nuestro llamamiento a la comunidad internacional para que durante este período crítico siga prestando al pueblo palestino la asistencia humanitaria y para el desarrollo que tanto se necesitan, especialmente para las labores de reconstrucción y la recuperación económica en la Franja de Gaza. 235. Reafirmamos los derechos inalienables del pueblo palestino y de la población del Golán sirio ocupado sobre sus recursos naturales, incluidos la tierra, el agua y los recursos energéticos, y exigimos que Israel, la Potencia ocupante, deje de explotar, dañar, destruir, agotar y poner en peligro los recursos naturales del Territorio Palestino Ocupado, incluida Jerusalén Oriental, y el Golán sirio ocupado. 236. Reafirmamos la necesidad de que los Gobiernos de la Argentina y del Reino Unido reanuden sus negociaciones de conformidad con los principios y los objetivos de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y las resoluciones pertinentes de la Asamblea General, a fin de encontrar a la mayor brevedad posible una solución pacífica a la disputa de soberanía relacionada con la cuestión de las Islas Malvinas, que perjudica gravemente la capacidad económica de la Argentina, y la necesidad de que ambas partes se abstengan de tomar decisiones que entrañarían la introducción de modificaciones unilaterales de la situación mientras las islas se encuentran en medio del proceso recomendado por la Asamblea General. 237. Reafirmamos la necesidad de encontrar una solución pacífica a las cuestiones de soberanía que afrontan los países en desarrollo, entre otras la disputa relativa al archipiélago de Chagos, incluida la isla Diego García, que el Reino Unido arrancó ilegalmente del territorio de Mauricio antes de su independencia, en violación del derecho internacional y de las resoluciones 1514 (XV), de 14 de diciembre de 1960, y 2066 (XX), de 16 de diciembre de 1965, de la Asamblea General. De no resolverse estas cuestiones en materia de descolonización y soberanía, el desarrollo y las capacidades y perspectivas económicas de los países en desarrollo se verían gravemente perjudicados y menoscabados. A este respecto, pese a la firme oposición de Mauricio, el Reino Unido pretendió establecer una "zona marina protegida" alrededor del archipiélago de Chagos, lo que vulnera el derecho internacional y dificulta aun más el ejercicio por parte de Mauricio de sus derechos soberanos sobre el archipiélago y el derecho de los ciudadanos mauricios que fueron desplazados a la fuerza por el Reino Unido a volver al archipiélago. 238. Tomamos nota de la Declaración de la Habana, aprobada en la II Cumbre de la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños, celebrada los días 28 y 29 de enero de 2014. 239. Reafirmamos nuestro firme rechazo a la imposición de leyes y reglamentos con un efecto extraterritorial y todas las demás formas de medidas económicas coercitivas, incluidas las sanciones unilaterales contra países en desarrollo, y reiteramos la urgente necesidad de eliminarlos inmediatamente. Recalcamos que esas medidas no solo socavan los principios consagrados en la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y el derecho internacional, sino que además constituyen una grave amenaza para la libertad de comercio e inversión. Por consiguiente, instamos a la comunidad internacional a que adopte medidas urgentes y eficaces para impedir la aplicación de medidas económicas coercitivas unilaterales en contra de los países en desarrollo. 240. Expresamos nuestro rechazo a las listas y certificaciones unilaterales por parte de países desarrollados y que afectan a los países en desarrollo, en particular las referidas a terrorismo, narcotráfico, trata de personas y otras de similar carácter. 241. Reiteramos nuestro llamamiento al Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América, formulado en la segunda Cumbre del Sur, organizada por el Grupo de los 77 y China y celebrada en Doha en 2005, a que ponga fin al embargo económico, comercial y financiero contra Cuba que, además de ser unilateral y contrario a la Carta de las Naciones Unidas, al derecho internacional, así como al principio de vecindad, causa grandes pérdidas materiales y daños económicos al pueblo de Cuba. Instamos al estricto cumplimiento de las resoluciones de la Asamblea General acerca de este asunto. También tomamos nota que en la Declaración de La Habana los Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno de la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños reafirmaron su más profundo rechazo a la aplicación de medidas coercitivas unilaterales y reiteraron una vez más su solidaridad con Cuba, al tiempo que reafirmaron su llamamiento al Gobierno de los Estados Unidos a que pusiera fin al bloqueo económico, comercial y financiero que impone a dicha nación hermana desde hace más de cinco décadas. Rechazaron la inclusión de Cuba en la denominada lista de Estados que promueven el terrorismo publicada por el Departamento de Estado de los Estados Unidos y solicitaron que se pusiera fin a esa práctica unilateral. 242. Reafirmamos nuestro rechazo a las sanciones económicas unilaterales impuestas contra el Sudán, que tienen efectos negativos sobre el desarrollo y la prosperidad del Sudán, y a este respecto pedimos el levantamiento inmediato de dichas sanciones.
