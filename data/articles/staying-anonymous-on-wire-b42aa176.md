Most people want an easy way to find and connect with others on 'WIRE' to start chatting, talking and sharing. When signing up we try to connect them with friends that are already using the app. Some, however, prefer a bit more privacy. They want to protect their identity and only connect to very few trusted people.

'Wire' does not require a phone number to register, and secondly people don't have to share their phone contacts with the WIRE app. Here's how to get set up for maximum privacy:
Create a new email address. Protonmail is great for this. Use this email to register a 'WIRE' account at app.wire.com (on a computer) OR on a tablet where no phone number is required to sign up. Download 'WIRE' on your phone/tablet/Laptop/PC and sign in with the account you just created. Don't give 'WIRE' access to the contacts on your device(s). Choose a display name that won't give away your identity. Choose a random @username - this handle is what you share with others so they can connect with you.

Follow these steps and none of your phone contacts will receive notifications that you're using WIRE. The only way to connect with you is if you share your @username. For more info on how 'WIRE' protects your privacy read our Privacy Policy and we've also published a very detailed privacy whitepaper.
