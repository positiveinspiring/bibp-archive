Indias 1.2 billion citizens are to be issued biometric identification
cards.
The cards will hold the persons name, age, and birth date, as well
as fingerprints or iris scans, though no caste or religious identification.
Within the next five years a giant computer will hold the personal details
of at least 600 million citizens, making this new information technology
system the largest in the world. The project will cost an estimated $3.5
billion.
The 600 million Indians will receive a sixteen-digit identity
number by 2014 in the first phase of the project.
Indias red tape is legendary:
citizens have dozens of types of identity
verification, ranging from electoral rolls to ration cards, yet almost none
can be used universally.
The new system will be a national proof of
identity, effective for everything, from welfare benefits to updating land
records. Forty-two percent of Indias population is below the poverty line
and citizens frequently move in search of jobs.
The government believes the
ID system will help citizens because they will no longer have a problem
identifying themselves. The biometric identity number will be entered every
time someone accesses services from government departments, drivers license
offices, and hospitals, as well as insurance, credit card, telecom, and
banking companies.
By bringing more people into the banking system, Indian
officials also hope to raise the number of people paying income taxes;
currently, less than 5 percent of the population pays income taxes.
The head of
Oxfam India, Nisha Agarwal, says a lack of identity verification
is a major problem, especially for urban migrants.
As a result, they are
excluded from dozens of government programs, which offer cheaper food, jobs,
and other benefits for poor people.
They remain treated as temporary
migrants and, without that piece of paper, some form of identification, they
are not able to access many of these government schemes that exist now, that
have large funds behind them and could actually make a huge difference in
poor peoples lives.
The scheme is the brainchild of Nandan Nilekani, one of Indias best-known
software tycoons and now head of the governments
Unique Identification
Authority.
We are going to have to build something on the scale of Google,
but it will change the country... every person for first time [will] be
able to prove who he or she is... We are not profiling a billion people.
This will provide an ID database which government can access online. There
will be checks and balances to protect identities, said Nilekani, who has
also been in talks to create a personalized carbon account so that all
Indians might buy green technologies using a government subsidy.
The government also plans to use the database to monitor bank transactions,
cell phone purchases, and the movements of individuals and groups suspected
of fomenting terrorism.
In January 2010, the Ministry of Home Affairs began
collecting biometric details of people in coastal villages to boost
security; the gunmen in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which killed 165 people,
sneaked into the country from the sea.
Critics say the project will turn India into an Orwellian police state that
will spy on citizens private lives.
We do not want an intrusive,
surveillance state in India, said Usha Ramanathan, a lawyer who has written
and lobbied against the project.
Information about people will be shared
with intelligence agencies, banks and companies, and we will have no idea
how our information is interpreted and used.
Civil liberty campaigners fear
the ID card will become a tool of repression.
Nandita Haskar, a human rights
lawyer, said,
There is already no accountability in regards to violations
of human and civil rights. In this atmosphere, what are the oversight
mechanisms for this kind of surveillance?
Indias plunge into
biometric identification comes as countries around the
globe are making similar moves.
In 2006, Britain approved a mandatory
national ID system with fingerprints for its citizens before public
opposition prompted the government to scale back plans for a voluntary pilot
program beginning in Manchester.
United States senators have proposed
requiring all citizens and immigrants who want to work in the country to
carry a new high-tech social security card linked to fingerprints as part of
an immigration overhaul.
