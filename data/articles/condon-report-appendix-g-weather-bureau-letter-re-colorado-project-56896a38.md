The University of Colorado, under sponsorship of the U.S. Air Force, is conducting a study of UFO's. Since "ESSA scientists and personnel are among the most skilled and careful observers to be found," the University has asked our cooperation.
All reports submitted for this project are on a voluntary basis and will be held in strict confidence by the University of Colorado.
Weather Bureau observers at stations in the 48 contiguous United States are requested to report any UFO sightings to the University of Colorado by FTS system, telephone 303-447-1000 and request number 443-6762. When the switchboard operator at the University of Colorado answers, advise that the Weather Bureau is calling with a UFO report and the party designated to accept the call will be connected.
Include in the report such information as:
- Time, place and duration of sighting
- Number of objects seen
- Size, distance and motion if known
- Your name and station
The University may arrange an interview with, and at the convenience of, the person making the report if the sighting holds special interest for UFO research.
Your cooperation in this important project is appreciated.
This OML is intended for information only at stations in Alaska and in the Pacific since they are not included in this program.
