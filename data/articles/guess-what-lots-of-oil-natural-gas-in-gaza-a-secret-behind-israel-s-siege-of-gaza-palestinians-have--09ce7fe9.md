"There is an abundance of oil reserves both on the strip and offshore"
http://blogs.state.gov/index.php/entries/q_israeli_palestinian_peace/
"The Palestinians are, in aggregate, energy rich. For the past six years,
the Palestinian Authority has been sitting on a major gas field that
contains at least 1.4 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas."

Lands Past, Future - World Energy Monthly Review
"Palestine was rewarded with an oil reserve 22 miles off of the coast of the
Gaza Strip. The entire country was excited by this natural mineral that
would hopefully provide them with the economic freedom and financial
stability they desired. Unfortunately, the financial success did not come
directly on the heels of their discovery"

To find the real reasons behind conflicts and wars in this world, you need
to follow some or all of four things: Money, blood, power or natural
resources (usually oil or natural gas but it can be cobalt like in the
Congo).
Oil is behind the conflicts in Darfur, Somalia and other similar places.
The war in Afghanistan was never about finding bin Laden. It was about
uniting Afghanistan into a single government so
a pipeline could be
constructed to bring a million barrels a day from areas north of
Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia to markets.
We need to stop listening to what
the "official" media tells us when it
comes to conflicts and wars because the official media is corporate and
government owned and/or controlled by government. Less than one percent of
the "news" in the world today is reported and what is reported is usually
heavily edited and slanted for propaganda purposes.
Governments don't want the world to know that huge genocides are going on
just because of oil, gas or other natural resources. The world might get
angry as a body and might organize to reject the genocides. Big Oil and
Energy doesn't want that to happen because it will interfere with their
profits.
Historically, it has been "efficient" for Big Energy's short-term profit
line to steal resources or get them "lower than wholesale" than to pay the
owners decently for them. This is how they've always done business (force by
boot and gun).
The World has been watching Israel's genocide of the Palestinians for a long
time but incredibly, the media never mentions the Palestinians' natural
resources or the fact that Israel has thwarted Palestine's efforts to
develop them.
The Palestinians are usually portrayed on television as victims of
impossible, cyclical poverty. Ironic the Palestinians wouldn't have to live
in poverty if Israel would let them develop their natural resources.
But developing Palestine's energy resources wouldn't be in Israel's
self-interest. The oil and gas revenues would empower the Palestinians. They
wouldn't have to starve to death or struggle in poverty. Empowered
Palestinians would be able to invest in infrastructure of their legal
government,
Hamas.
Israel wants the Palestinians crushed and disappeared so Israel can expand
its territories for its citizens, have better access to the sea for its navy
and serve as watchdog for US and Israeli hegemony.
Israel wants the Palestinians' oil and gas for its own because Israel needs
it for its country's needs. Middle eastern countries are loathe to sell
their supplies to Israel. The rulers and people of area countries know that
Israel has been slaughtering their Muslim kin for over six decades and it is
against their morals to help Israel with energy supplies, especially fuel
for Israeli tanks, airplanes and military vehicles.
To thwart Palestine from developing its energy supplies, Israel keeps the
region in turmoil plus in 2005,
"Israel delivered a major blow to the
Palestinians' fledgling oil industry by choosing to import natural gas from
Egypt. By doing this, Israel completely bypassed its neighbor in favor of
making a political statement. The Israeli government feared that any money
given to Palestine would be later used to fund acts of terrorism against Israel."

Finding information about Palestine's oil and gas resources is difficult.
Even Wikipedia doesn't mention it nor do most encyclopedias and other
academic resources.
The major corporate media has completely ignored and/or has remained
blissfully ignorant about Palestinian oil and gas because it goes against
the script of how powerful hidden western corporate and government interests
want to portray Palestine.
Western media, Israel and the US would rather have the world see
Palestinians groveling in extreme poverty and/or portrayed as "terrorists"
who want to kill everyone.
Palestinians, empowered from oil and gas revenues, could live decently. Shed
of their impoverished image, the world would see them as the Bright, Shining
Human Beings they are. But Bright, Shining Human Beings are harder to
disappear than those depicted by governments and the media as untermenschen
(nazi German term for "inferior people").
If you want to know more about this important subject, the best places to
look are oil and energy websites and publications.
Palestinian oil and gas is no secret in the energy field. It's just a secret
to everyone else.
