I have noticed a convergence of awareness
between UFO/ET investigators and general conspiracy investigators in
relation to how autocratic power in todays society exerts itself from the
control of an elite few down the chain of command to the many.
Globally and
in America we have two very contradictory political forces that work in
direct opposition to each other one being autocratic and the other
democratic.
In general I believe that autocrats still dominate world governments as they
have throughout human history. In some places they rule overtly but in so
called democratic societies clever autocrats covertly use democracy and
national security as fronts or guises to secretly manipulate and rule.
Autocrats are able to do this because the general population even today is
easily intimidated and lead through a combination of fear and bribes.
People
in democratic societies consciously live an illusion that they are free
while they still unconsciously think and act as loyal subjects of the crown
seeking patronage and power from local and national government.
On occasion when the general population within a country becomes aroused,
democracy can assert itself for short periods of time until the population
loses interest or is otherwise distracted.
In a classic case of the tail
wagging the dog most of the time those autocratic corporate special economic
and political interests that ideally should serve democratic society turn
the tables and manipulate society into serving them.
Historically autocratic power was generally accepted as a divine right by
ruling family dynasties and their subjects so feudal power could be
exercised overtly as in places like North Korea even today. Increasingly as
democratic and republican ideas have spread about the world the elite
autocrats have been forced to move underground becoming ever more
sophisticated, secret and deceptive as to how they project power and control
populations.
Sophisticated mechanisms for the projection of secret autocratic power and
control have evolved over time.
In todays society control revolves around
covert control of finance and the media as well as covert control over the
military through national security guises and deceptions based on extreme
secrecy, fear, bribes, clearance, special access and need to know.
It is my opinion that the real axis of evil in the world to a large degree
revolves around three very powerful autocratic controlled entrenched special
interests; energy, arms and finance.
I believe that these three industries
and
the elite families that control these interests have a very high degree
of responsibility for the general destruction of society and the global
environment.
These very same industries that are doing the damage to society
and the environment promote themselves as the ones best suited to provide
solutions to the very problems they are creating in a constant propaganda
bombardment in the corporate mainstream media.
These global entrenched interests and families that control these industries
comprise a covert sophisticated form of modern day royalty. Not only do
these elite rule society in general through secrecy and stealth but they
also appear to be the major culprits behind the 60 year old UFO/ET cover up
that lies at the very heart of their secret covert power over world
populations.
The elite families and the corporations that they own have the motive, the
intent and the means to suppress extraterrestrial reality out of self
interest just as they do in other societal domains. In a more general way
they also have the motive, the intent and the means to actively, secretly
suppress democracy while publicly showing support.
The one thing that we can
count on is that these very sophisticated autocratic gangsters are doing the
exact opposite of what they say they are doing.
While some conspiracy investigators focus on how money is used to control
society and the media through private central banking networks perhaps not
enough attention is being paid as to how the elite control the world
military and the mainstream press through the auspices of national security.
In my opinion the greatest threat to national security around the globe is
secret elite control over the national security establishment worldwide and
not just in America.
The military just seems to now be waking up to the fact that they are being
used and manipulated by civilian leadership closely tied to this economic
and political axis of evil being discussed.
If we just look at the present
civilian leadership in America we have the energy interests
the Bushes, and
the Rockefellers along with their closest friends and advisers like
Cheney
and Gates involved in the highest levels of civilian leadership.
We have one Rockefeller in
Congress that is on the Senate Intelligence Committee directly, gates who used to be head of the CIA and who is close to the elder Bush who
was also head of the CIA is now Secretary of Defense,
Dick Cheney who
is tied to both oil and arms through his connections to Halliburton is Vice
President, and the younger Bush himself is president.
I am not familiar with
those in Congress and at the White House who are closely connected to
banking and finance but I am sure there are plenty. We can see that oil,
arms and finance are very well represented in the civilian leadership of
America and elsewhere around the globe.
Then there is this revolving door between the military and the civilian
leadership where elite families and servants are well infiltrated into all
aspects of the military and civilian chain of command.
The military through
various task forces and working groups related to extraterrestrial reality
and other areas involving national security seem to slowly be beginning to
realize as we in the public are realizing, that the national security
apparatus has been hijacked by the elite special interest.
I think this
process of awaking has been hastened by the American elites arrogant,
foolish, wasteful wars in the Middle East and has further focused military
and public attention on the global elites covert power and destructive
behavior worldwide.
It is really the arms merchants, energy industry and banking that really
control secrecy, clearance, special access and need to know for everybody
else down the military chain of command to the rank and file. What we really
have is not a national security system but an elite control system that in
itself is the greatest national security threat to civil society in the
world today.
We even have a horrible situation where terrorism and
environmental destruction are both being assisted and manipulated to serve
elite interests.
When Thomas Jefferson said,
I know of no better repository of the truth
than with the people.
He knew what he was talking about. In order to
take our country back and our world back from this axis of evil we have to
know the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Once we get that,
we then have the situational awareness necessary to combat these powerful
entrenched interests that are the instruments of mass societal and
environmental destruction.
We have to dismantle the bodyguard of lies both UFO/ET related and otherwise
because this is what protects the global elite and the industries that they
own. Both the public and the military need to stop blindly acting like loyal
subjects of the King and Queen and act as a free people should.
As the lies compound one on another they become more difficult to manage and
the truth more difficult to suppress.
I believe its just a matter of time
until coalescing groups seeking the truth in the civilian sector combined
with groups in the military create so much heat, spontaneous smoldering
truth, that a spark or several sparks will ignite the mountain of lies and
become unstoppable.
I predict that the truth suppression networks of the entrenched global
special interests will be overwhelmed and a general conflagration, a
catastrophic process of renewal of society and a corresponding end to he
UFO/ET cover up will be upon us.
It wont be pretty and it did not have to happen
this way, but it is renewal nevertheless and better than the alternative of
continued slippage into an Orwellian dark future...
