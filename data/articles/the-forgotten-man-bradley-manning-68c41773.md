The inside story of the security breach that
enraged the American Government, and a profile of the man who made it all
possible.
While
WikiLeaks boss Julian Assange has
been cast as a heroic champion of free speech, his ongoing expose of US
foreign policy would not have been possible without the work of Private
Bradley Manning.
It was Manning who allegedly stole the classified
documents published by WikiLeaks. It is Manning who now languishes in a US
military prison.
Now reporter Quentin McDermott tells the inside story of Bradley Manning and
his daring intelligence heist. David House is one of the few civilians
allowed to visit Bradley Manning in jail. He describes the young soldier's
mental deterioration and his struggle to deal with long hours of
confinement.
He tells the program:
"...the US Government is just trying to put
immense pressure on him in order to get him to crack open."
In Monday's Four Corners we hear the only
recording of Bradley Manning's voice and we listen to the logs of alleged
conversations with the man who ultimately betrayed him.
That man is Adrian Lamo.
In an extraordinary interview he reveals how
he came to know Bradley Manning, claiming the young soldier openly confessed
to him his role in the WikiLeaks scandal.
Four Corners also explores the disputes that have erupted inside WikiLeaks.
A former insider has told the program how he held deep reservations about
Julian Assange's determination to keep releasing material that might
compromise his source.
The program puts these accusations to the WikiLeaks boss.
There is little doubt America wants to punish Julian Assange. But to bring a
case against him vital questions must be answered:
-
How did Private Bradley Manning steal
the classified material?
-
How did he relay it to WikiLeaks?
-
Did he do this of his own accord or did
Julian Assange conspire with him to take the information?
