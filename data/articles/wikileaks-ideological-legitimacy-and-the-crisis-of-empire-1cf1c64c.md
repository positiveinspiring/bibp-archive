WikiLeaks, Ideological
Legitimacy and the Crisis of Empire

While empires try to maintain their hegemony
through economic and military prowess, they must also rely on a form of
ideological legitimacy to guarantee their rule.
Such legitimacy is often
embedded in the geopolitical reputation of the empire among its allies and
reluctant admirers. Once that reputation begins to unravel, the empire
appears illegitimate.
The establishment of the US empire in the aftermath of World War II built
upon its economic and military supremacy. That empire created an
architecture of financial and geopolitical institutions that served not only
its own interests, but also those of global capital and international legal
and democratic structures.
There were, of course, myriad contradictions that
materialized throughout the earliest cold war period, but much of the West
accepted the general framework and ideological legitimacy of the empire.
While a crisis of legitimacy emerged around the Vietnam War and the
undermining of the
Bretton Woods agreement by the Nixon administration, it
was not until the end of the cold war and the development of reckless unipolar geopolitics over the last decade that a real decline in US hegemony
became apparent.
Given the battered economic and military standing of the United States over
the past several years, the hysterical reaction of the American political
class over the recent release of State Department
cables by WikiLeaks is not
surprising.
However, it is instructive to note the response of those in the
West to such "displays (of) imperial arrogance and hypocrisy" as reported by
Steven Erlanger in
The New York Times.
Erlanger cites an important editorial
from the
Berliner Zeitung that underscores the question of ideological
legitimacy:
"The U.S. is betraying one of its founding myths: freedom of
information. And they are doing so now, because for the first time since the
end of the cold war, they are threatened with losing worldwide control of
information."
Commenting in The Guardian on the hypocrisy of the United States, British
columnist John Naughton points to Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton's
January 21, 2010 address about Internet freedom and the remarkable
subsequent about-face in denouncing such freedom as practiced by WikiLeaks.
Naughton does not spare other officials in the West who have been clamoring
for curtailment of such freedom of information on the Internet.
As
alleged
by Naughton:
"What WikiLeaks is really exposing is the extent to which the
western democratic system has been hollowed out
And when, finally, the
veil of secrecy is lifted, their reflex reaction is to kill the messenger."
The abuses heaped on
Julian Assange and the threats against him, especially,
but not exclusively, from politicians in the United States, reflects this
hollowing out of democracy and a fear of the new virtual world of free
speech.
Writing in the December 11, 2010 issue of the Melbourne Age, Assange's Australian attorney,
Peter Gordon,
opines:
The sight of the most prominent politicians in the world inciting either the
prosecution, incarceration or assassination of Assange, or the persecution
of his family, is a form of barbarism that demeans us all.
Moreover, the
phenomenon of companies as big as MasterCard and Visa being gang-pressed into
anti-trust violations of their commercial relations with WikiLeaks is truly
frightening.
Beyond the critical matter of freedom of information, however, is the
erosion of alliances by stalwart supporters of US global hegemony in the
aftermath of the WikiLeaks publication of some of the hundreds of thousands
of diplomatic cables.
When The Guardian released some of the documents
dealing with Poland, even its conservative prime minister, Donald Tusk,
declared that,
"we have a serious problem
not with image, as some
countries do, and not reputation, like the US does. It's a problem of being
stripped of illusions about the nature of relations between countries,
including such close allies as Poland and the US."
The Australian government has been buffeted by a series of revelations that
surfaced when the United States rejected an appeal by that government to see
all of the cables relating to US-Australian relations before WikiLeaks
released them.
Beyond the embarrassment to members of the Labor government,
there is a growing sentiment that the US is both arrogant and incompetent.
Perhaps the drive to shut down WikiLeaks and prosecute Julian Assange is the
last gasp of a dying empire to shore up its fading legitimacy in the world
and among its own citizens.
Hence, the hyperbolic criticism by US Attorney
General Eric Holder that WikiLeaks has put,
"the lives of people who work for
the American people at risk; the American people themselves have been put at
risk."
As the WikiLeaks publications make clear, the diplomatic corps is
just another instrument of the US empire. Indeed, it is the empire itself
that is putting its own citizens at risk through the reckless, illegal and
immoral actions perpetrated around the globe.
In their desperation to retain the empire, the US political class is
undermining the remaining vestiges of the empire's legitimacy over the
WikiLeaks affair. They may also be preparing to expand the definition of
treason to include those who are dedicated, as is Assange and WikiLeaks, to
freedom of information, especially when it reveals the duplicities of
empire.
Beyond WikiLeaks, the crisis of empire, according to
Filipino
scholar-activist Walden Bello,
"bodes well not only for the rest of the
world. It may also benefit the people of the United States. It opens up the
possibility of Americans relating to other people as equals and not as
masters."
Given the panic of the US masters, it might be time for the serfs at home to
revolt under the banner of "Treason to Empire is Loyalty to Humanity." If
that seems a little too provocative, we should remember the first American
struggle for independence from the British Empire.
In defense of his
anti-British Virginia Stamp Act Resolution, Patrick Henry is alleged to have
declaimed:
"If this be treason, make the most of it."
