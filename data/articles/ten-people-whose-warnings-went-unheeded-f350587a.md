In Greek mythology,
Cassandra was the daughter of the King of Troy.
She was so beautiful that
the God Apollo granted her the gift of seeing the
future, prophecy. When Cassandra spurned Apollos love,
he put a curse on her - that no one would believe any of
her predictions.
Cassandra was thus an epic
and tragic figure - granted a powerful ability, yet
powerless to use it.
Throughout history there
have been many Cassandra-type figures, people who
predicted the coming of terrible tragedies and
disasters, but whose warnings were ignored. These people
were not gods and were not using special powers of
prophecy.
They were people who had a
deep understanding of the realities of a situation and
tried to warn others. In each case, others failed to
listen to their warnings, and tragedies that might have
been averted were not.
Here are ten examples of people who tried to
warn others, but whose warnings went unheeded.
10 - Adlai Stevenson
On October 24, 1963, less than a month before
President John F Kennedy was scheduled to go to Dallas as part of a campaign
swing through the critical electoral state of Texas, Kennedys UN Ambassador
Adlai Stevenson went to Dallas to speak at Dallas Memorial Auditorium to
mark U.N. Day.
Many people in Dallas openly and violently hated
the United Nations, Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, and the
Kennedys. Their hatred was so intense that they persuaded Governor John Connally to declare the day before Stevensons visit US Day out of
protest.
When Stevenson arrived at the auditorium there
were thousands of picketers outside, and many inside, to protest him and the
UN (and the Kennedy Administration).
As Stevenson tried to speak these
protestors stamped their feet, shouted, booed, and rattled noisemakers to
disrupt him. But Stevenson pressed on.
One man screamed,
Kennedy will get his reward in hell and
Stevenson is going to die.
After the speech, police tried to escort
Stevenson out of the auditorium but the angry crowd surrounded him.
At one
point Stevenson stepped out of the police protection to try to talk to a
woman who was screaming at him. The woman clobbered Stevenson over the head
with her picket sign.
Stevenson then said,
Are these human beings or are these
animals?
Upon arriving back in Washington, Stevenson
warned Arthur Schlesinger, Kennedys speechwriter, that Kennedy
should not go to Texas, or at least, avoid Dallas.
There was something very ugly and
frightening about the atmosphere, Stephenson told Schlesinger.
Schlesinger did not pass along the warning. Even
if he had, it is doubtful Kennedy would have avoided Dallas, to do so would
have seemed cowardly.
Kennedy paid for this decision with his life.
9 - Joe Wilson
In February 2002, Vice President
Dick Cheney
authorized the CIA to dispatch former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson to
the small African nation of Niger to see if there was anything to the rumors
that Saddam Hussein and Iraq were trying to purchase yellowcake uranium for
use in nuclear weapons.
Yellowcake is uranium concentrate powder
(colored bright yellow) that is an intermediary step in processing raw
uranium ore into weapons grade, highly enriched uranium used in nuclear
weapons. As Niger has considerable natural uranium deposits, the possibility
existed Iraq may have been trying to secretly buy the yellowcake to use in a
possible nuclear weapons program.
Wilson consulted with the Niger Prime Minister
and came away with the conclusion that there was nothing to reports that
Iraq had sales agreements with Niger to buy yellowcake uranium. He reported
this to the CIA in March 2002.
In January 2003, in his State of the Union address, President
George W. Bush
stated,
The British government has learned that
Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from
Africa.
After the invasion of Iraq by the United States,
in July 2003, Wilson wrote an op-ed article for the New York Times where he
disclosed the mission to Niger.
He stated that he had looked into the
possibility of Iraq buying uranium and found nothing to it, and that he
reported this to the CIA and White House. He implied that the Presidents
statement was misleading as justification for war with Iraq.
CIA Director George Tenet would later say those
words should never have been in the text of the Presidents State of the
Union address, but still believed Iraq was trying to get its hands on
nuclear material and was developing or even had developed an atomic weapon
or other weapon of mass destruction (WMD).
After the US invasion in Iraq, a long and exhaustive search of the country
was conducted to see if Iraq did in fact have nuclear material, a nuclear
weapon, a nuclear weapons programs, or any of the weapons of mass
destruction that the Bush administration warned the American people of.
No WMD or any indication that Iraq had an active
or even rudimentary nuclear program was ever found.
8 - Dwight Eisenhower
A Military-industrial complex (MIC) is a kind of
iron triangle composed of a nations armed forces,
legislative/administrative government, and defense industry companies who
work together to constantly funnel national resources into more and more
military procurement.
Though such complexes have existed since man
began to use technology to wage war and develop better weapons, it was in
the aftermath of World War II and the rise of the atomic age that the US
version of the MIC began to frighten people who worried the MIC was
beginning to over power typical democratic means of restraint, moderation,
and control.
No one was more concerned than President and
former General Dwight Eisenhower. In his eight years as President,
Eisenhower had watched the fearsome growth and power of the ever expanding
and powerful United States MIC.
As he left office on January 17, 1961 in
his
farewell speech to the Nation, he made the following warning:
A vital element in keeping the peace is our
military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant
action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own
destruction
This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms
industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -
economic, political, even spiritual - is felt in every city, every
statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the
imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend
its grave implications.
Our toil, resources and livelihood are all
involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of
government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted
influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial
complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists
and will persist.
We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties
or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted.
Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry
can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military
machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that
security and liberty may prosper together.
Eisenhowers warning went unheeded.
In the US
today,
the MIC is larger and more powerful than ever, making it difficult to
near impossible for the US to stop making massive weapons programs and
expending huge amounts of its national treasure on the military, even during
times of relative peace (such as the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet
Union).
Today the US military budget is almost as large
as that of all other nations combined.
7 - John Parke
In the late 1800s a bunch of wealthy industrial
barons led by Henry Clay Fricke decided they wanted their own private
retreat from the soot, dirt, and heat of the city - a place out in the
mountains of western Pennsylvania.
They purchased a dam and lake that had been
built in the early 1800s as a reservoir on the Conemaugh River near
Johnstown Pennsylvania and created the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club.
They called their lake Lake Conemaugh and though the dam that created it
had originally been well-built, over the years, due to poor maintenance and
alterations, it had become more and more unstable.
By the time the industrialists bought it, it was
already leaking and in a state of disrepair. Rather than use some of their
incredible wealth to strengthen and fix the dam, they mostly made patches
using clay and straw whenever it sprung a leak, which it did quite often.
On May 31, 1889, a storm struck the Johnstown-South Fork area creating one
of the worst downpours ever recorded in Pennsylvania history. Six to ten
inches of rain fell in a 24-hour span and the local streams burst their
banks, pouring water into the already unstable Lake Conemaugh.
That morning, Elias Unger, the president of the South Fork Fishing and
Hunting Club awoke to see the water level of the lake was nearly cresting
the dam. Unger quickly assembled a crew to try to clear the blocked
spillways but they could not clear the debris.
His men then made a frantic effort to dig
another spillway to take some of the pressure off the dam and divert the
water. This too failed.
Fearing the dam would collapse at any moment, Unger ordered John Parke, an
engineer for the South Fork Club, to ride on horseback to the nearby town of
South Fork to the telegraph office to send warnings to South Fork and
Johnstown.
Parke made it and telegraphed not one but two
warnings, both of which were never passed along to South Fork and Johnstown
officials who could have taken action and evacuated the towns. Over the
years there had been so many false alarms of the dam breaking (because of
the frequent leaks and repairs) that no one believed Parke when he told them
the dam would not hold.
At around 3:10pm, the dam finally gave way. Its contents, an estimated 20
million tons of Lake Conemaugh water, rushed down the Little Conemaugh
River.
The water reached the little town of South Fork first. Fortunately
most of the inhabitants heard the roar of the water coming and were able to
scamper up the side of the mountain to high ground and only four people were
killed.
The people of Johnstown were not as fortunate.
The wave of water, moving at 40 miles per hour and reaching a height of 60
feet, carrying houses, telephone poles, rocks, trees, railroad cars, and
everything else in its path, slammed into the town.
An estimated 2,209 people were killed making it
the worst disaster in the history of the US at that time.
6 - Cyril Evans
In April 1912 Cyril Evans was working as the
telegraph operator on board the
SS Californian on a voyage across the
Atlantic.
On the night of April 14, 1912, the Captain of
the Californian, Stanley Lord, brought the ship to a halt as it had entered
a wide ice field with many large icebergs. Lord came into the wireless
operators room and ordered Evans to warn other ships in the area of the ice.
Evans proceeded to do just that, sending out
wireless warnings to other ships in the area that they were approaching ice.
In the wireless room aboard the Titanic, operators Jack Philips and Harold
Bride were trying to get through a backlog of private messages they were to
send from the ship to the United States, the destination of the Titanic on
her maiden voyage.
Philips received Evans ice warning message, but
because the Californian was so close to the Titanic and Evans had his set
turned to full power, he almost blew the headset off Philips head. An angry
Philips told him to get off and Philips never passed along the ice warning
to the bridge or the ships Captain.
Evans felt he had done what he was
ordered to do, switched off his radio set, and went to bed.
A short time later the Titanic, heading at full
steam west toward America, came upon the ice Evans had tried to warn them
about, struck an iceberg and sank with the loss of over 1500 people.
5 - Jimmy Harrell
In 2010, operations on the
Deep Water Horizon
oil platform, owned by BP and operated by Transocean, were not going well.
In fact, getting the oil well drilled and
producing oil (and revenue) had been a nightmare from the beginning and was
behind schedule. The Deepwater Horizon was drilling an exploratory well at
the Macondo Prospect region located about 41 miles off the southeast coast
of Louisiana, at a water depth of approximately 5,000 feet.
On April 20, 2010,
the oil rig exploded, caught
fire, and sank, killing eleven workers and causing one of the worst
environmental disasters in history.
On the morning of the disaster, rig operator and Transocean employee Jimmy
Harrell was seen to be in an argument with a senior BP official. BP wanted
Harrell to substitute lighter seawater to hold the gas in place and stop it
from rising up the drill pipe, and not heavy (and more costly) lubricant
packing (called mud).
Mud was what was typically used to pack the
bottom of the rigs drill pipe before capping the well. Harrell refused to do
so without conducting two leak tests. For both tests, leaks were found in
the pipe allowing drilling mud to flow out and onto the drill platform. A
successful test should have had no mud leaking out of the pipe.
For some reason, in spite of the leaks, Harrell
went forward with the removal of the heavy mud from the pipe, replacing it
with lighter seawater.
At 9:45pm a geyser of seawater, methane gas and mud
burst out of the pipe onto the platform. The gas ignited and the rig
exploded and caught fire.
Though he would later testify that he could not recall having a
confrontation with the BP official, as soon as the rig exploded and caught
fire, and before he abandoned the rig, other crew members heard Harrell
shouting into a satellite phone talking to the BP office in Houston and
saying:
Are you fucking happy? Are you fucking
happy? The rigs on fire! I told you this was going to happen.
Though Harrell now states he cannot remember
giving BP a warning, others have testified that is exactly what he did.
At a meeting with BP officials just before the
explosion, a frustrated Harrell told another employee I guess thats what
we have the pincers for - referring to the automatic blowout preventer
which was supposed to slice into and seal the well head if the ultimate
disaster happened.
The blowout preventer, along with just about
every other safety device, failed that day.
4 - Katsuhiko
Ishibashi
Katsuhiko Ishibashi is a well-respected
professor and seismologist at Kobe University in Japan.
Since the early 2000s he has been warning Japan
that the countrys many nuclear power plants are in danger of serious damage
or even a melt down because they have been built in earthquake-prone areas.
In 2006 he was a member of a government committee that was to revise the
national guidelines on making Japans nuclear power plants more resistant to
earthquakes. He proposed that Japan review its standards for surveying and
assessing the danger from active faults, but this proposal was rejected.
He later resigned saying the committees review
process was unscientific and the outcome of the committee findings were
rigged in favor of the Japan Electric Association.
He also claimed the final
guide that the committee produced was flawed because it underestimated the
design basis for earthquake ground motion. Ishibashi also stated that
Japanese engineers were overconfident in their predictions of plant
engineering and safety design to withstand an earthquake.
Ishibashi warned of the danger of an earthquake-induced nuclear disaster at
an International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics conference held in Sapporo.
He said:
The seismic designs of nuclear facilities
are based on standards that are too old from the viewpoint of modern
seismology and are insufficient. The authorities must admit the
possibility that an earthquake-nuclear disaster could happen and weigh
the risks objectively.
Ishibasi once said:
I think the situation right now is very
scary
its like a kamikaze terrorist wrapped in bombs just waiting to
explode.
All of Ishibasis fears came true on March 11,
2011 when a huge off shore
earthquake and resulting tsunami damaged the
Fukushima Diiachi nuclear power plant resulting in a level 7
International
Nuclear Event Scale disaster - the highest level nuclear disaster possible.
In May 2011, he said,
If Japan had faced up to the dangers
earlier, we could have prevented Fukushima.
3 - Brooksley Born
When Brooksley Born took over as head of the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a government agency empowered
with the task of monitoring and regulating the commodities exchange in the
US, she very quickly discovered something that shocked her.
An entire branch of the commodities market known
as Over the Counter commodities (OTC commodities) existed that were for all
intents and purposes, totally unregulated. Worse, the government (which was
supposed to monitor and regulate commodity trading) didnt even know these
types of commodity investments existed.
Gargantuan sums of money were being traded as
OTC commodities called derivatives, with no regulation and nobody even
aware it was taking place. On Wall Street they called it the Black Box of
trading, only those involved knew the details. And they wanted it to stay
that way.
Born had other ideas.
The more she learned about OTC commodities
and the
derivatives markets, the more frightened she grew that something terrible
would happen to the US and world economies. Born was most worried about the
derivatives and swaps markets - where the risk associated with investments
were traded as insurance policies.
These were complicated financial investments
understood by very few people, and banks began to fraudulently sell them to
unsuspecting customers who did not fully understand what they were buying,
and who ended up losing huge sums of money.
Born believed that it was the job of her agency
to investigate and prosecute such fraud.
Alan Greenspan had other ideas
about that. Greenspan, who more then any other single individual can be
blamed for the US financial and economic collapse of 2008, believed,
foolishly and naively, that regulation and enforcement was unnecessary -
that banks, financial firms, and business could regulate themselves.
Born believed differently and when she tried to move to regulate OTC
derivatives for the first time, she was met by the full force of the
financial industry lobbying effort. She and her agency were crushed by
political power and Born eventually resigned.
But the warnings she had made about the
unregulated OTC derivatives market becoming far too large and posing a
threat to the very structure of the US and world economy did not go away.
By
2007 just before
the crash, the OTC derivatives market was valued at a
mind-numbing $595 trillion.
Derivatives were being written to insure
derivatives, which were themselves written on derivatives. It was a house of
cards of financial debt waiting to fall, all it needed was a triggering
event.
And the collapse of the housing market did just
that. In a matter of months the huge load of debt, most of it in the form of
credit default swaps and derivatives, led to the fall of Lehman Brothers,
which triggered an almost complete collapse of the US financial market.
Only emergency influx of US taxpayer money to
buy the worthless toxic assets off the books of banks and large investment
houses, saved the US economy from plunging into another Great Depression.
As the US financial markets imploded under the weight of derivative trading
debt she had warned against and tried to regulate, Born had this to say:
It was my worst nightmare coming true.
Nobody really knew what was going on in the market. The toxic assets of
many of our biggest banks are over-the-counter derivatives and caused
the economic downturn that made us lose our savings, lose our jobs, lose
our homes. It was very frightening.
And she has another warning, even after the
collapse of 2008:
I think we will have continuing danger from
these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis. It
may differ in details, but there will be significant financial downturns
and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap over and over until we
learn from experience.
2 - John ONeil
John ONeil was an FBI agent who, more than
anyone else in the agency, was actively investigating the terrorist group
Al-Qaeda in the 1990s and the links between state sponsors of terrorism such
as Yemen and Saudi Arabia, Al-Qaeda operatives, and attacks on US interests
around the world including the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center
buildings.
The more ONeil dug into the shadow world of
international terrorism, the more he began to warn anyone in Washington DC
that would listen, that Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden were major threats to
the US.
Throughout the 1990s, with the first attack on
the World Trade center buildings, the attacks on US embassies, and the
attack on the US Cole, all being "linked" to Al-Qaeda, ONeil and his
predictions were turning out to be true. Yet his personal style stepped on
the shoes of powerful people in Washington DC and FBI headquarters, many of
whom were jealous of his successful predictions.
By August 2001, his enemies had pushed him out
of the FBI.
ONeil resigned to take the job as head of security for the
World Trade Center buildings. One of his friends told him he had taken the
perfect job because Al-Qaeda had already attacked there and he was safe.
ONeil disagreed and said that he thought Al-Qaeda was coming back to the
World Trade Centers to finish the job.
The night before the attacks in a conversation
with another friend, ONeil told him that he felt an attack on US soil was
going to happen, and happen in a matter of days or weeks.
He was still monitoring activities coming out of
Afghanistan and felt, in his stomach, that the attack was coming, and soon.
He had good reason to feel this way. Just before he left the FBI, ONeil was
closing in on the trail of several leads, leads linking terrorists coming
out of Yemen into the United States. Information from a terrorist suspect
the FBI was tracking should have been setting off red warning lights, but
without ONeil, no one was shouting the warnings (with the exception of
Richard Clarke and a few others who were actively and aggressively trying to
warn the new Bush administration that an attack was coming) and no one in
the
Bush administration was listening, or concerned.
This terrorist told the FBI of a meeting in
Malaysia attended by two of the Al-Qaeda terrorists who had participated in
the attack and bombing of the US Cole. These two had been moving in and out
of the United States and practicing on flight school simulators.
They would be two of the Al-Qaeda terrorists who
on September 11, 2001, crashed flight 77 into the Pentagon.
John ONeil was in the south World Trade Center building that day. He
survived the initial impact of the plane. He called his wife to tell her
conditions were terrible but he was making his way out of the building. He
never made it. His body was later found in one of the stair towers of the
south building.
For more information on John ONeil and his
incredible story, see the PBS Frontline documentary called The Man Who
Knew.
1 - Roger Boisjoly
In the 1980s Roger Boisjoly worked as an
engineer at
Morton Thiokol, maker of the solid rocket boosters used
in the space shuttle program.
In 1985, a year before the
space shuttle
Challenger disaster, Boisjoly had been warning Thiokol that the joints used
to seal the sections of the solid rocket boosters could fail if they became
too cold before launch.
The space shuttle used two solid fuel rocket boosters and a central hydrogen
gas tank, to fuel the engines for launch. The different sections of the
solid rocket boosters were sealed to one another with a rubber material or
gasket called an o-ring.
Boisjoly and other Thiokol engineers had found
that in cold weather conditions, the rubber material in the o-rings became
brittle and did not seal the sections into place. In this case, the o-ring
would fail to prevent the flames from reaching the rockets metal casing. If
this happened, the flames could trigger a huge explosion of the hydrogen
fuel tank located right next to the boosters.
On January 27, 1986 the space shuttle Challenger was on the launch pad set
for launch the following day.
The weather forecast for Cape Canaveral was to
be unusually cold with temperatures dropping below freezing. All of that
evening and into the morning hours of January 28, Boisjoly and other
engineers pleaded with NASA to delay the launch. Senior managers at Thiokol
and NASA officials rejected their argument. NASA insisted the shuttle would
launch the morning of January 28 as scheduled, even with the cold weather.
Only a minute after taking off, the o-ring on
one of the solid fuel rocket boosters failed just as Boisjoly had predicted
it would.
The flames shot out from the booster and hit the
hydrogen tank, which exploded, killing all of the astronauts on board.
Boisjoly was so sure that the booster o-rings would fail, he could not make
himself watch the launch.
The resulting investigation of the Challenger disaster showed NASA had
developed an internal culture that all but ignored safety. It was a culture
that pushed to launch the Challenger to meet the schedule and keep
politicians happy. Astronaut safety took a back seat to NASA and Washington
DC politics.
For his testimony exposing NASA and Thiokol, the space engineering community
blackballed Boisjoly. He spent the last 17 years of his life lecturing on
engineering ethics.
In 2003 when an unchanged NASA culture caused
the
disintegration of the shuttle Columbia, Boisjoly stated that NASA
engineers and administrators should be charged with murder and the only way
to change the NASA culture was to throw people in jail.
