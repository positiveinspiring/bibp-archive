A newly leaked U.S. diplomatic cable originally written over six years ago
confirms that the agenda to merge the United States, Canada and Mexico into
an integrated
North American Union has been ongoing for years, debunking
claims made consistently by the corporate media and establishment talking
heads that the NAU is a baseless conspiracy theory.
The cable, released through the WikiLeaks website and apparently written
Jan. 28, 2005, discusses some of the obstacles surrounding the merger of the
economies of Canada, the United States and Mexico in a fashion similar to
the European Union,
reports the National Post.
An incremental and pragmatic package of tasks for a new North American
Initiative (NAI) will likely gain the most support among Canadian
policymakers, the document said.
The economic payoff of the prospective
North American initiative
is available, but its size and timing are
unpredictable, so it should not be oversold.
While serving to confirm the agenda to integrate the United States, Mexico
and Canada into an EU-style political and monetary union,
the Wikileaks
cable will come as no surprise to those who watched Alex Jones 2006
documentary Endgame, in which precisely the same information was outlined,
with particular focus on the Security and Prosperity Partnership, or
SPP
meetings.
The mission to create a North American Union was also discussed in September
2006 during a
closed-door meeting of high-level government and business
leaders in Banff, Canada.
Despite the manifestly provable factual basis of the matter, during the 2008
presidential election the establishment media attempted to smear Ron Paul by
attributing the notion of a move towards a North American Union to him and
then claiming it was a non-existent conspiracy theory, when the veracity
of the issue was readily documented from the very start.
A
Newsweek hit piece subsequently claimed that Ron Pauls concerns over a
NAFTA superhighway, a North American Union or a regional currency were
completely baseless, and yet the newly leaked cable states U.S. diplomats
were busy discussing a,
move forward with continental integration, including
a possible common currency, labour markets, international trade and the
borders of the three countries, as well as easier access across the U.S.
border, more than six years ago.
Watch a clip from the 2006 documentary
Endgame in which the agenda behind
the North American Union was exposed, even as the corporate media still
claimed it was a mythical conspiracy theory:
