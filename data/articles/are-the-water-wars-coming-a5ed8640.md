# Are The Water Wars Coming?

The author Mark Twain once
remarked that "whisky is for drinking; water is for fighting
over" and a series of reports from intelligence agencies and
research groups indicate the prospect of a water war is
becoming increasingly likely.
In March, a report from the
office of the US Director of National Intelligence said the
risk of conflict would grow as water demand is set to
outstrip sustainable current supplies by 40 per cent by
2030.
"These threats are real and they
do raise serious national security concerns,"
Hillary
Clinton, the US secretary of state, said after the report's
release.
Internationally, 780 million
people lack access to safe drinking water, according to
the
United Nations.
By 2030, 47 percent of the worlds
population will be living in areas of high water stress,
according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development's Environmental
Outlook to 2030 report.
Some analysts worry that wars of
the future will be fought over blue gold, as thirsty people,
opportunistic politicians and powerful corporations battle
for dwindling resources.
Dangerous warnings
Governments and military
planners around the world are aware of the impending
problem; with the US senate issuing reports with names like Avoiding
Water Wars: Water Scarcity and Central Asias growing
Importance for Stability in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
"Water scarcity is an issue
exacerbated by demographic pressures, climate change and
pollution," said Ignacio Saiz, director of Centre for
Economic and Social Rights, a social justice group.
"The
world's water supplies should guarantee every member of the
population to cover their personal and domestic needs."
With
rapid population growth, and increased industrial demand,
water withdrawls have tripled over the last 50 years, according
to UN figures.
"Fundamentally, these are issues
of poverty and inequality, man-made problems," he told Al
Jazeera.
Of all the water on earth, 97
per cent is salt water and the remaining three per cent is
fresh, with less than one per cent of the planet's drinkable
water readily accessible for direct human uses.
Scarcity is
defined as each person in an area having access to less than
1,000 cubic meters of water a year.
The areas where water scarcity
is the biggest problem are some of the same places where
political conflicts are rife, leading to potentially
explosive situations.
Some experts believe the only
documented case of a "water war" happened about 4,500 years
ago, when the city-states of Lagash and Umma went to war in
the Tigris-Euphrates basin.
But Adel Darwish, a journalist
and co-author of Water Wars: Coming Conflicts in the Middle
East, says modern history has already seen at least two
water wars.
"I have [former Israeli prime
minister] Ariel Sharon speaking on record saying the reason
for going to war [against Arab armies] in 1967 was for
water," Darwish told Al Jazeera.
Some analysts believe Israel
continues to occupy the Golan heights, seized from Syria in
1967, due to issues of water control, while others think the
occupation is about maintaining high ground in case of
future conflicts.
Senegal and Mauritania also
fought a war starting in 1989 over grazing rights on the
River Senegal.
And Syria and Iraq have fought minor
skirmishes over the Euphrates River.
Middle
East hit hard
UN studies project that 30
nations will be water scarce in 2025, up from 20 in 1990.
Eighteen of them are in the Middle East and North Africa,
including Egypt, Israel, Somalia, Libya and Yemen.
Water shortages could cost the
unstable country 750,000 jobs, slashing incomes in the
poorest Arab country by as much as 25 per cent over the next
decade, according to a report from the consulting firm
McKinsey and Company produced for the Yemeni government in
2010.
Darwish bets that a battle between south and north
Yemen will probably be the scene of the next water conflict,
with other countries in the region following suit if the
situation is not improved.
Commentators frequently blame
Yemen's problems on tribal differences, but environmental
scarcity may be underpinning secessionist struggles in the
country's south and some general communal violence.
"My experience in the first gulf
war [when Iraq invaded Kuwait] is that natural resources are
always at the heart of tribal conflicts," Darwish told Al
Jazeera.
The Nile is another potential
flash point. In 1989, former Egyptian president Hosni
Mubarak threatened to send demolition squads to a dam
project in Ethiopia.
"The Egyptian army still has
jungle warfare brigades, even though they have no jungle,"
Darwish said.
On the Nile, cooperation would
benefit all countries involved, as they could jointly
construct dams and lower the amount of water lost to
evaporation, says Anton Earle, director of the Stockholm
International Water Institute think-tank.
"If you had an agreement between
the parties, there would be more water in the system," he
told Al Jazeera. The likelihood of outright war is low, he
says, but there is still "a lot of conflict" which
"prevents joint infrastructure projects from going ahead".
Differing views
Water scarcity, and potential
conflicts arising from it, is linked to larger issues of
population
growth, increasing
food prices and global warming.
There are two general views
about how these problems could unfold.
The first dates back
to the work of Thomas Malthus, an eighteenth century British
clergyman and author who believed that:
"The power of
population is so superior to the power of the earth to
produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in
some shape or other visit the human race."
In other words, more people and
scant resources will invariably lead to discord and
violence.
"Unequal power relations within
states and conflicts between ethnic groups and social
classes will be the greatest source of social tensions
rising from deprivation," said Ignacio Saiz from the social
justice group.
"Water too often is treated as a commodity,
as an instrument with which one population group can
suppress another."
Recent scholars, including Thomas
Homer-Dixon, have analyzed various case studies on
environmental degradation to conclude that there is not a
direct link between scarcity and violence.
Instead, he
believes inequality, social inclusion and other factors
determine the nature and ferocity of strife.
Bolivia, South Africa, India,
Botswana, Mexico and
even parts of the US have seen vigorous water related
protests, says Maude Barlow, author of 16 books and a former
senior adviser to the UN on water issues.
"The fight over water
privatization
in Cochabamba, Bolivia did turn into a bit of
a water war and the army was called in," Barlow told Al Jazeera.
"In Botswana, the government smashed bore holes as
part of a terrible move to remove [indigenous bushmen] from
the Kalahari desert. Mexico City has been forcibly taking
water from the countryside, confiscating water sources from
other areas and building fortresses around it, like it's a
gold mine. In India, Coke will get contracts and then build
fortresses around the water sources," taking drinking and
irrigation water away from local people.
"In Detroit 45,000,
officially, have already had their water cut off."
Human
rights
Strife over water, like
conflicts more generally, will increasingly happen within
states, rather than between them, Barlow says, with large
scale agribusiness, mining and energy production taking
control over resources at the expense of other users.
The IPPC, the UN panel which analyses
climate science, concluded that:
"Water and its availability
and quality will be the main pressures on and issues
for, societies and the environment under climate
change."
Dealing with these pressures
will require improved technologies, political will and new
ideas about how humans view their relationship with the
substance that sustains life.
"People have the right to
expect access to a basic life resource like water by
virtue of being human, regardless of the social
situation they are born into," Saiz said.
"Alongside the worrying
development of water scarcity, I am hopeful that we will
see increasing struggles to see access to water as a
right, and not a privileged."
