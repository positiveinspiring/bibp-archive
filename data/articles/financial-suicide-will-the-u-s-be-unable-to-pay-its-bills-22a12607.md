Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner says
its unthinkable that there would be a time when the U.S. couldnt pay its
bills.
Thats why he says hes confident of a deal to
raise the governments borrowing limit before an August 2 default deadline.
He says the U.S. has a top credit rating and that despite all the rhetoric,
there are signs that both sides are coming closer to an agreement.
But he says the legislative process needs to get
started by Monday night.
We are going to talk a lot about insanity in this essay and these
declarations by Geithner are a good place to start. Look at this above chart from
the Office of Management and Budget. Thats a graphic image of the United
States governments swan dive into oblivion. Thats a straight line into
fiscal hell. Thats the visual proof that the only reasons that Geithner is
not taken away in a straight jacket is that he knows how to dress well.
Look at that chart again and let your imagination drop with that line that
marks off the descent in two-hundred-billion-dollar amounts. Thats a lot of
money!
More accurately said, it was a lot of money but
today $100 billion does not buy governments much since so much of it has to
go to paying interest on debts and the insanity of war instigated by mad men
who should not be allowed to walk freely on our planet.
Argentinas President Cristina Fernandez, whose
own country
defaulted on about $100 billion in debt a decade ago, asked
last week: "When did the American dream become a nightmare?"
The current reality, represented very clearly by
the above chart, is that the American government cannot pay its bills, not
with real money at least, only with the fabricated stuff, the kind of money
that can be created out of thin air.
Its funny money and it is taking the whole world
down to a place where it will probably take many decades from which to
recover.
Congressman Ron Paul said,
It isnt too late to return to fiscal
sanity. We could start by canceling out the debt held by
the Federal
Reserve, which would clear $1.6 trillion under the debt ceiling. Or we
could cut trillions of dollars in spending by bringing our troops home
from overseas, making gradual reforms to Social Security and Medicare,
and bringing the federal government back within the limits envisioned by
the Constitution.
Yet no one is willing to step up to the
plate and make the hard decisions that are necessary. Everyone wants to
kick the can down the road and believe that deficit spending can
continue unabated.
Eventually the American taxpayer will get
so fed up with this bunch of morons in Washington - Republican and
Democrat - they are going to demand we take real action with real
numbers; cut through the crap and start dealing with this debt and we
can do it.
Why did we say in U.S., the bondholders
cant be hurt? What the hell was that about? It was all mad! said
Howard Davidowitz.
It certainly is too late to return to fiscal
sanity for it is insanity that rules the world, insanity that drives the
United States government and insanity that runs deep in the psyche of the
human race.
We are a race of madmen though of course some are much madder
than others.
Today we wake up to see the work of a super madman who gunned down 90
innocent boys and girls in Norway. The madmen who have run the pharmaceutical
industry kill hundreds of thousands of men, women and children each year so
its really hard to decide who is the most insane.
In the United States
alone over 100,000 die each year from properly prescribed medicine.
President Obama and his allies in Congress
believe they know better than you do what is in your own best interest,
writes attorney Jonathan Emord, which means we have a bunch of morons
in Washington running roughshod over our future lives.
As Emord tells us, they even want to control the
food we eat so you really know that those running the show behind the scenes
are truly mad.
Monsanto, with their genetically modified foods, are in all
likelihood creating a food Armageddon.
In short, that company should be dissolved and
its executives locked up for their violence against humanity.
Apparently whether the little people like
something
or not doesnt matter now in this new world.
Daily Bell
There is little desire or regard for the middle
class from the people at the top of the human heap because a big portion of
their wealth is derived from robbing the lower classes.
The
Federal Reserve acts at the top of the line
as the greatest robber of them all, raping the entire system to serve the
people at the top.
The
first top-to-bottom audit of the
Federal Reserve uncovered eye-popping new details about how the U.S.
provided a whopping $16 trillion in secret loans to bail out American
and foreign banks and businesses during the worst economic crisis since
the Great Depression.
An amendment by Sen. Bernie Sanders to the
Wall Street reform law passed one year ago this week directed the
Government Accountability Office to conduct the study.
As a result of this audit, we now know that
the Federal Reserve provided more than $16 trillion in total financial
assistance to some of the largest financial institutions and
corporations in the United States and throughout the world, said
Sanders.
This is a clear case of socialism for the
rich and rugged, youre-on-your-own individualism for everyone else.
Financial Poison
Contemporary civilization has already committed financial suicide and we are
now just waiting for the poison to take full effect but many millions are
already feeling the poison flooding through their veins.
The only answer the governments have been able
to come up with to resolve the situation is to drink much more poison (debt)
and ram it down the throats of their citizens.
The future of the world is at stake and we have
mad politicians at the helm so we do indeed have much to be concerned about.
The banks of Europe are the new Feudal
Manors and Masters. All Europeans now serve them as debt-serfs in one
way or another.
If we knock down all the flimsy screens of artifice and
obscuring complexity, what we see in Europe is a continent of
debt-serfs, indentured to the banks under the whip of the European Union
and its secular religion, the euro, wrote Charles Hugh Smith.
The title of his essay was
500 Million
Debt-Serfs: The European Union Is a Neo-Feudal Kleptocracy.
We are closing in on an event that will,
set fire to the heart of the global
financial system. The insolvency of the global financial system, and of
the Western financial system in the first place, returns again to the
front of the stage after just over a year of political cosmetics aimed
at burying this fundamental problem under truckloads of cash,
writes GEAB.
The elites that stand behind the EU are trying
to
build a
one-world order, and they will stop at
nothing to get it. The same thing is going on in
the U.S. with the debt crisis. An orchestrated
agenda. The Americans will eventually get
European-style austerity. They simply
dont
understand the ramifications yet.
Daily Bell
There is a shock coming soon, probably in the
autumn of 2011 where the collective experience will literally be the ground
giving way beneath our feet as the underpinnings of our global financial
system come apart.
As we head into the black hole of debt that cannot be repaid we will see the
word default come up again and again.
Jean-Claude Trichet had the
word default stuffed down his throat last week and in the United States
politicians are now, like tug boats, maneuvering the United States of
America closer to defaulting on a mountain range of debt and liabilities
that should never have been incurred by a sane society and government.
Karl Denninger
writes,
When investors get nervous about stocks,
they usually flow to bonds. Today, theyre not. Theyre buying gold
instead which is up just under 1%, or silver, which is up 3.2%
During the next few weeks or short months even
the blind will begin to see which way events are going to take us. Every
tick upward of interest rates will ring the bells of doom since servicing
trillions upon trillions of debt becomes that much more impossible.
Bloomberg
published,
That consumers are increasingly 'using
credit cards to pay for basic necessities as income gains fail to keep
pace with rising food and fuel prices'.
Silvio Tavares, senior vice president of
the largest credit card processor said,
Consumers, particularly in the lower-income
end, are being forced to use their credit cards for everyday spending
because theres been no other positive catalyst, like an increase in
wages, to offset higher prices. Its a cash-flow problem.
It is not only governments that are in serious
trouble but an entire generation or even two generations that are drowning
in debt and fiscal insanity.
The people of Brazil and Chile also have a cash-flow problem. Their banks
were loose and easy with money they lent out because in some cases they have
been collecting over 200 percent interest on peoples debts. There are
perhaps a billion debt slaves in the world and we can count most countries
within those numbers.
Perhaps my numbers are way too conservative;
there is no way to count but the situation is dire.
To make matters much worse for the near future of the American economy we
and preview at end of the year seeing 3.7 million Americans stop receiving
jobless benefits. This financial Armageddon for these 3.7 million families
will be cruel enough for them but it will spill over to the wider economy -
acting as a hit man to consumption in the first quarter of 2012.
Thats a lot of people to drop out of the bottom of society all at once.
Its the safety net tearing, allowing perhaps as many as 10 million men,
woman and children to fall to total destitution.
Now imagine what could
happen if the United States government goes down and cannot pay for the food
for its 40 million Americans on food stamps?
Are you getting an idea yet of the bad endings
that are possible for the American dream?
Down the Slippery
Slope
In
a recent Elliott Wave Theorist, Robert Prechter focuses on
a different metaphor from sailing to explain whats happening in the
economy. He references the granite slope of Stone Mountain, pictured below
for those of you who have never visited Atlanta.
Investments
Near Atlanta is a mound of granite called
Stone Mountain.
Over the years, people have fallen to their
deaths because they allowed the mountain to fool them. There is no sharp
cliff of which to beware. The slope is rounded. So, people sometimes
sneak past the protective fence and edge their way down the
mountainside, thinking that they have sufficient traction to remain
stable.
But when they pass the point at which they
can hold on, the slope only increases, and they fall to their doom.
This seems to me somewhat analogous to the
economic depression that has been developing since the year 2000.
It started out slowly, so that people didnt
even realize it was beginning. As the economy deteriorated, they didnt
worry much, because they thought it had plenty of traction.
Periods of moderate stability increased
their confidence.
The quick slide of 2008 wasnt fatal, because there
was a convenient ledge to stop the fall. Today, it seems that 29,900
economists out of the approximately 30,000 in the world are breathing
easier, thinking the mountain is safe.
But just a few more steps downward in the
economy and the slope will be too steep to keep it from going into a
death slide.
