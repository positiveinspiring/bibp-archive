A TALE OF THREE BANKS
It has been said that those who are ignorant of history are doomed to repeat
its mistakes. It may come as a surprise to learn that the Federal Reserve
System is America's fourth central bank, not its first.
We have been through
all this before and, each time, the result has been the same. Interested in
what happened? Then let's set the coordinates of our time machine to the

THE LOST
TREASURE MAP
The bitter experience of the American colonies with fiat money; the resolve
of the founding fathers to prohibit the new nation from resorting to paper
money without backing; the drafting of the Constitution to that end; the
creation of a true American dollar; the prosperity that followed.
In the golden days of radio, on the Edgar Bergen Show, the ventriloquist
would ask his dummy, Mortimer Snerd, "How can you be so stupid?" And the
answer was always the same. After a moment of deep thought on the part of
Mortimer, he would drawl his reply, "Well, it ain't easy!"
When we look at the monetary chaos around us today - the evaporating value
of the dollar and the collapsing financial institutions - we are compelled
to ask: How did we get into this fix? And, unfortunately, Mortimer's
response would be quite appropriate.
To find out how we got to where we are, it will be necessary to know where
we started, and a good place to begin that inquiry is with the Constitution
of the United States.
Article I, Sections 8 and 10 say:
Congress shall have the power - To borrow
money... to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin,
and fix the standard of weights and measures;... [and] to provide for
the punishment of counterfeiting...
No state shall ... coin money; emit bills of credit; [or] make anything but
gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts.
The delegates were precise in their use of these words. Congress was given
the power to "coin money," not to print it. Thomas M. Cooley's Principles of
Constitutional Law explains that 'to coin money is to stamp pieces of metal
for use as a medium of exchange in commerce according to fixed standards of
value."
What was prohibited was to "emit bills of credit" which, according to the
speeches and writings of those who drafted the document, meant the printing
of paper IOUs which were intended to be circulated as money - in other
words, the printing of fiat money not backed by gold or silver.
At first, it would seem that nothing could be more clear. Yet, these two
simple clauses have become the basis for literally thousands of pages of
conflicting interpretation. The crux of the problem is that, while the
Constitution clearly prohibits the states from issuing fiat money, it does
not specifically prevent the federal government from doing so.
That was
truly an unfortunate oversight on the part of the document's framers, but
they probably never dreamed in their wildest nightmares that their
descendants "could be so stupid" as to not understand their intent.
Furthermore, "it ain't easy" to miss their intent. All one has to do is look
at the monetary history that led up to the Constitutional Convention and to
read the published letters and debates of the men who affixed their
signatures to that founding document.
As one reads through the debates on the floor of the convention, one is
struck by the passion that these delegates held on the subject of money.
Every one of them could remember from his personal experience the utter
chaos in the colonies caused by the issuance of fiat money.
They spoke out
against it in no uncertain terms, and they were adamant that it should never
be tolerated again in America - at either the state or federal level.
PAPER MONEY IN THE COLONIES
The first colonial experience with fiat money was in the period from 1690 to
1764.
Massachusetts was the first to use it as a means of financing its
military raids against the French colony in Quebec. The other colonies were
quick to follow suit and, within a few years, were engaging in a virtual
orgy of printing "bills of credit." There was no central bank involved. The
process was simple and direct, as was the reasoning behind it.
As one
colonial legislator explained it:
Do you think, gentlemen, that I will consent to load my constituents with
taxes when we can send to our printer and get a wagon load of money, one
quire of which will pay for the whole?
The consequences of this enlightened statesmanship were classic.
Prices
skyrocketed, legal tender laws were enacted to force the colonists to accept
the worthless paper, and the common man endured great personal losses and
hardship. By the late 1750s, Connecticut had price inflated by 800%, the
Carolinas had inflated 900%, Massachusetts 1000%, Rhode Island 2300%.1
The situation was so out of hand that, beginning in 1751, the British
Parliament stepped in and, in one of those rare instances where interference
from the mother country actually benefited the colonies, it forced them to
cease the production of fiat money. Henceforth, the Bank of England would be
the only source.
What followed was unforeseen by the promoters of fiat money.
Amid great
gloom about "insufficient money" a miracle boom of prosperity occurred.
The
forced use of fiat money had compelled everyone to hoard their real money
and use the worthless paper instead. Now that the paper was in disgrace, the
colonists began to use their English and French and Dutch gold coins once
again, prices rapidly adjusted to reality, and commerce returned to a solid
footing. It remained so even during the economic strain of the Seven-Years
War (1756-1763) and during the period immediately prior to the Revolution.
Here was a perfect example of how an economic system in distress can recover
if government does not interfere with the healing process.2

WARTIME INFLATION
But all of this came to a halt with the onset of colonial rebellion. Not
only did open hostilities throw England deeper into the cogs and wheels of
the central-bank mechanism, it also was the compelling motive for the
colonies to return to their printing presses.
The following figures speak
eloquently for themselves:
-
At the beginning of the war in 1775, the total money supply for the
federated colonies stood at $12 million.
-
In June of that year, the Continental Congress issued another $2 million.
Before the notes were printed, another $1 million was authorized.
-
By the end of the year, another $3
million.
-
$19 million in 1776.
-
$13 million in 1777.
-
$64 million in 1778.
-
$125 million in 1779.
-
A total of $227 million in five years on top of a base of $12 million is
an increase of about 2000%.
-
On top of this "federal" money, the states were doing the same in an
approximately equal amount.
-
And still more: the Continental Army, unable to get enough money from
Congress, issued "certificates" for the purchase of supplies
totaling $200
million.
-
$650 million created in five years on top of a base of $12 million is an
expansion of the money supply of over 5000%." 1
Although the economy was devastated by this flood of fiat money, most
victims were totally unaware of the cause.
In 1777, the sentiment of a large
segment of the population was expressed by the words of one patriotic old
lady who said:
"What a shame it is that Congress should let the poor
soldiers suffer when they have power to make just as much money as they
choose."2
The immediate result of this money infusion was the appearance of
prosperity.
After all, everyone had more money and that was perceived as a
very good thing. But this was quickly followed by inflation as the
self-destruct mechanism began to roll. In 1775, the colonial monetary unit,
called the Continental, was valued at one-dollar in gold. In 1778, it was
exchanged for twenty-five cents.
By 1779, just four years from its issue, it
was worth less than a penny and ceased to circulate as money at all.
It was
in that year that George Washington wrote:
"A wagon-load of money will
scarcely purchase a wagon-load of provisions."3
1. For an overview of expenditures, see
Paul and Lehrman, pp. 26-27.
2. Gouge, p. 28. The naïveté of this lady may be humorous, but are Americans
any more enlightened today? Would she not feel at home among our modern-day
electorate who clamor for legislation to pump Federal-Reserve fiat money
into projects to alleviate hardship among the poor and unemployed?
3. QuotedbyBolles,Vol.i,p.l32.
The saying "Not worth a Continental" has its origin in this gloomy period.
The true nature of the inflation effect has never been more accurately
perceived or more vividly described than it was by Thomas Jefferson:
It will be asked how will the two masses of Continental and of State money
have cost the people of the United States seventy-two millions of dollars,
when they are to be redeemed now with about six million? I answer that the
difference, being sixty-six millions, has been lost on the paper bills
separately by the successive holders of them.
Every one, through whose hands
a bill passed, lost on that bill what it lost in value during the time it
was in his hands. This was a real tax on him; and in this way the people of
the United States actually contributed those sixty-six millions of dollars
during the war, and by a mode of taxation the most oppressive of all because
the most unequal of all.1
PRICE CONTROLS AND LEGAL-TENDER LAWS
It was natural that people struggled to find ways to escape the destruction
of their savings, and the two most obvious methods were,
-
to regularly
adjust prices upward as the value of the money went downward
-
exchange
their goods and services only for gold coins
In response, the colonial
legislatures and the Continental Congress did what governments always do to
prevent it.
They resorted to wage and price controls and to legal-tender
laws with harsh penalties for non-compliance. Under one such law, those who
refused to accept worthless money were even described as traitors.
It
declared:
If any person shall hereafter be so lost to all virtue and regard for his
Country as to refuse to accept its notes, such person shall be deemed an
enemy of his Country.
Rhode Island not only leveled a substantial fine for non-acceptance of its
notes but, upon a second offense, an individual lost his citizenship. When
this was declared unlawful by a panel of judges, the legislature reacted by
dismissing the judges from office.3
Then, as now, those who suffered the most from fiat money were those who
held the most trust in government. In 1777 these were mostly the Whigs, for
it was they who patriotically held paper money and, as a result, lost their
livelihoods and their life savings. The Tories, on the other hand,
mistrusting both government and its paper money, passed the bills as quickly
as possible in trade for real assets, especially gold.
Consequently, as a
group, they weathered the storm fairly well. But they often were derided by
their less prudent neighbors as "Torie speculators," "hoarders," and even
"traitors."
All of this was painfully fresh in the memories of the delegates to the
Constitutional Convention and, as the opening session convened in
Philadelphia in 1787, there were angry mobs in the streets threatening the
legislators. Looting was rampant. Businesses were bankrupt. Drunkenness and
lawlessness were everywhere to be seen. The fruit of fiat money had ripened,
and the delegates did not enjoy its taste.
In October of 1785, George Washington wrote:
"The wheels of government are
clogged, and ... we are descending into the vale of confusion and
darkness."1
A year later, in a letter to James Madison, he said:
"No day was
ever more clouded than the present. We are fast verging to anarchy"2
In February of 1787, Washington wrote to Henry Knox:
"If any person had told
me that there would have been such formidable rebellion as exists, I would
have thought him fit for a madhouse."3
1. Quoted by Atwood, p. 3.
2. Ibid., p. 4.
3. Ibid., p. 4.
Just three months prior to the opening of the convention, Washington voiced
his reasons for rejecting the notion of fiat money.
In answer to the
complaint that there was not enough gold coin (specie) to satisfy the needs
of commerce, he replied:
The necessity arising from a want of specie is represented as greater than
it really is. I contend that it is by the substance, not the shadow of a
thing, we are to be benefited.
The wisdom of man, in my humble opinion,
cannot at this time devise a plan by which the credit of paper money would
be long supported; consequently, depreciation keeps pace with the quantity
of the emission, and articles for which it is exchanged rise in a greater
ratio than the sinking value of the money. Wherein, then, is the farmer, the
planter, the artisan benefited?
An evil equally great is the door it immediately opens for speculation, by
which the least designing and perhaps most valuable part of the community
are preyed upon by the more knowing and crafty speculators.1
THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION
This was the prevailing view held by the great majority of delegates to the
Convention. They were adamant in their resolve to create a constitution
which would prevent any state, and especially the federal government itself,
from ever again issuing fiat money. And they said so in unmistakable terms.
Oliver Ellsworth from Connecticut, who later was to become our third Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court, said:
This is a favorable moment to shut and bar the door against paper
money. The mischief of the various experiments which have been
made are now fresh in the public mind and have excited the disgust of
all the respectable parts of America.2
George Mason from Virginia told the delegates he had a "mortal hatred to
paper money."
Previously he had written to George Washington:
"They may pass
a law to issue paper money, but twenty laws will not make the people receive
it. Paper money is founded upon fraud and knavery."
James Wilson from Pennsylvania said:
"It will have the most salutary
influence on the credit of the United States to remove the possibility of
paper money."
John Langdon from New Hampshire warned that he would rather reject the whole
plan of federation than to grant the new government the right to issue fiat
money.
George Reed from Delaware declared that a provision in the Constitution
granting the new government the right to issue fiat money,
"would be as
alarming as the mark of the beast in Revelation."
Thomas Paine, although not a delegate to the Convention, had written the
previous year that he was strongly opposed to fiat money, which he called
counterfeiting by the state, and he especially abhorred legal tender laws
which force people to accept the counterfeit.
He said:
"The punishment of a
member [of a legislature] who should move for such a law ought to be death".
An interesting thought.
If any further evidence is needed that the Founding Fathers intended to
prohibit the federal government from issuing "bills of credit" consider
this. The first draft of the Constitution was copied in large measure from
the original Articles of Confederation. When it was taken up for
consideration by the delegates, therefore, it contained the old provision
that had caused so much chaos.
It stated:
"The legislature of the United
States shall have the power to borrow money and emit bills of credit."
But,
after a lively discussion on the matter, the offending provision was voted
to be removed from the Constitution by an overwhelming margin.1
Voicing the
sentiment of the majority of the delegates, Alexander Hamilton said:
"To
emit an unfunded paper as the sign of value ought not to continue a formal
part of the Constitution, nor ever hereafter to be employed; being, in its
nature, repugnant with abuses and liable to be made the engine of imposition
and fraud."2
The journal of the Convention for August 16 contains this notation:
It was moved and seconded to strike out the words "and emit bills of
credit," and the motion ... passed in the affirmative. [The vote cleared by
a margin of better than four to one.] 3

3. Quoted by Bancroft, pp. 39, 40.
The Tenth Amendment states:
"The powers not delegated to the United States
by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the
States respectively, or to the people."
The power to issue bills of credit
is definitely not delegated to the United States, and it is specifically
prohibited to the States.
Therefore, if any power to issue fiat money
legally exists at all, it is reserved for the people. In other words,
individuals and private institutions, such as banks, have the right to issue lOUs and hope that the public will use them as money, but government, at any
level, is clearly prohibited by the Constitution from doing so.
A SUGGESTION FOR YOUR CONGRESSMAN
Incidentally, the Constitution has never been amended on this point, nor
has the provision that only silver and gold can be used as lawful money.
It
would be interesting if each reader of this book would send copies to his or
her elected representatives in Washington, or at least a photocopy of this
section. Every member of Congress has sworn to uphold the Constitution, and
you might attach a short note asking them when they intend to begin.
Do not be disappointed if your reply is less than satisfactory. Politicians
have a similar problem to that which judges have. It is permissible to rock
the boat from time to time, but they are not supposed to sink it. Suits
against the government challenging the constitutionality of our monetary
system seldom get to court. It is safer for the justices to decline to
accept these cases or to dismiss them as supposedly "frivolous."
Otherwise
they would face a difficult choice. Either they would have to mutilate logic
in order to uphold the present inconsistencies - thus, opening themselves to
possible ridicule - or they would have to declare in favor of the
Constitution and literally cause the collapse of the entire
deficit-spending, central-bank mechanism.
Such an act would take a
considerable amount of courage. Not only would they suffer the wrath of the
Establishment that is nourished by that mechanism, they also would have to
face a bewildered public which, because of lack of knowledge about the
Constitution or the nature of money, could easily be convinced that the
judges had lost their minds.
Likewise, it is safer for politicians to
respond to inquiries of this kind merely by quoting some self-serving
government document which makes our fiat monetary system sound quite legal
and marvelously constitutional.
Unfortunately, that is reality. Until the public becomes considerably better
informed than it is at present, we cannot expect too much from the courts or
from Congress. Bringing this matter to the attention of your elected
representatives, however, is still well worth the effort, because the
process of education has to start somewhere, and Washington is an excellent
place to begin.
Returning to the point of this digression, however, it is important to know
that the federal government was given a precisely littiited monetary
function: "to coin money" and to "regulate the value thereof." In view of
the fact that gold and silver coin was
specifically defined as the only kind of money to be allowed, there can be
no doubt of what was meant by the first half of that power.
To coin money
meant to mint precious-metal coins. Period.
The second half is equally clear. Both in the Constitution and in the
discussions among the delegates, the power to regulate the value of gold and
silver coin was closely tied to the power to determine weights and measures.
They are, in fact, one and the same. To regulate the value of coin is
exactly the same as to set the nationally accepted value of a mile or a
pound or a quart. It is to create a standard against which a thing may be
measured.
The wording of this section of the Constitution can be traced to
the original Articles of Confederation which further clarifies the meaning
that was generally understood at that time:
The United States in congress assembled shall... have the sole and
exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin struck
by their own authority, or by that of the respective states - fixing the
Standard of Weights and Measures throughout the United States.
The intent, therefore, was simply for Congress to determine the exact weight
of a precious metal that would constitute the national monetary unit.
THE ORIGIN OF THE DOLLAR
At the time of these deliberations, Spanish silver coins, called pieces of
eight, had already become the de facto monetary unit.
An official commission
had been established by the Continental Congress to sample the circulating
coins in the country and determine their average value by weight and purity.
Charts were published, and all coins of various origin were listed by
comparative value. Congress was already "regulating the value of" the
nation's money by the time the Constitution was drafted.
How these coins
became dollars is an interesting story.
Edwin Vieira tells us:
Monetary historians generally first associate the dollar with one Count
Schlick, who began striking such silver coins in 1519 in Joachim's Thai,
Bavaria.
Then called "Schlicktenthalers" or "joachimsihalers" the coins
became known simply as "thalers," which transliterated into "dollars."
Interestingly, the American colonies did not adopt the dollar from England,
but from Spain.
Under that country's monetary reform of 1497, the silver
real became the Spanish money-unit, or unit of account. A new coin
consisting of eight reales also appeared.
Variously known as pesos, duros,
piezas de ocho ("pieces of eight"), or Spanish dollars (because of their
similarity in weight and fineness to the thaler), the coins quickly achieved
predominance in financial markets of the New World because of Spain's
then-important commercial and political position.
In 1785, Thomas Jefferson urged the adoption of the Spanish silver dollar as
the nation's official monetary unit.
In a pamphlet submitted to the
delegates of the Continental Congress, he said:
Taking into our view all money transactions, great and small, I question if
a common measure, of more convenient size than the dollar, could be
proposed... The unit or dollar is a known coin, and the most familiar of
all to the minds of people.
It is already adopted from south to north; has
identified our currency, and therefore happily offers itself as an unit
already introduced.2
On July 6, 1785, Congress unanimously voted to adopt the Spanish dollar as
the official monetary unit of the United States.
Jefferson realized,
however, that this was not sufficient. Although the coin had been one of the
most dependable in terms of weight and quality, it still varied in content
between issues, and a way had to be found to rate one coin in value against
another. That was, after all, the service that Congress was required to
render when it was given the power to "regulate the value" of money.
Jefferson came directly to the point when he said:
"If we determine that a
dollar shall be our unit, we must then say with precision what a dollar is.
This coin as struck at different times, of different weight and fineness, is
of different values."3
The logic voiced by Jefferson could not be ignored.
Two years later, after
carefully examining the actual weight and fineness of the Spanish dollars
currently in circulation, Congress defined the dollar. After ratification of
the Constitution, a dollar would contain 371.25 grains of fine silver, and
all items in commerce, including other coins, were to be measured in value
against that standard.
As the Spaniards continued to reduce the silver content of their coins, the
pressure for the minting of an American dollar of predictable value began to
mount.
Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, in his 1791 report to
Congress, urged the establishment of a federal mint and also presented a
powerful case for maintaining an inviolable standard for the coins to be
produced by that mint.
He said:
The dollar originally contemplated in the
money transactions of this country, by successive diminutions of its
weight and fineness, has sustained a depreciation of five per cent, and
yet the new dollar has a currency in all payments in place of the old,
with scarcely any attention to the difference between them.
The
operation of this in depredating the value of property depending upon
past contracts, and... of all other property is apparent. Nor can it
require argument to prove that a nation ought not to suffer the value of
the property of its citizens to fluctuate with the fluctuations of a
foreign mint, or to change with the changes in the regulations of a
foreign sovereign...
The quantity of gold and silver in the national coins, corresponding with a
given sum, cannot be made less than heretofore without disturbing the
balance of intrinsic value, and making every acre of land, as well as every
bushel of wheat, of less actual worth than in time past...
[This] could not
fail to distract the ideas of the community, and would be apt to breed
discontent as well among those who live on the income of their money as
among the poorer classes of the people to whom the necessities of life would... become dearer.1

Gales, compil. 1834), Appendix, pp. 2059,2071-73. Cited by Vieira, pp.
95,97.
BIMETALLISM
Note in the preceding quotation that Hamilton referred to both gold and
silver coins, not merely silver.
That is because it was precisely at this
time that Congress began to consider a bimetallic coinage. In retrospect,
this was a mistake for, throughout history, bimetallism has never worked
well very long. It always has led to confusion and, ultimately, the
disappearance as money of one of the metals.
This is because there is always
a subtle shifting of the relative values between gold and silver - or any
other two metals for that matter - depending on constantly changing supply
and demand.
We may set a value ratio of one to the other that is quite
acceptable today but, eventually, that ratio will no longer reflect reality.
The metal which grows in value over the other will be hoarded or possibly
even melted down because it will bring a higher price as metal than it will
as money.
That is precisely what happened in the early days of our Republic.
It was
determined after careful analysis of the free-market that the value of gold
at that time was approximately fifteen times the value of silver. The
Coinage Act of 1792 accordingly set the relative value of gold-to-silver at
fifteen-to-one. It then authorized the federal government to mint gold coins
called Eagles, and it specified that their value was ten dollars. In other
words, the gold coins would be equal in value to ten silver coins.
Ten
silver coins, each of 371.25 grains of fine silver, would contain a total of
3,712.5 grains. The content of the Eagle, therefore, was one-fifteenth that
amount, or 247.5 grains of fine gold.
Contrary to popular misconception, Congress did not create a "gold dollar."
(It didn't do that until fifty-seven years later in The Coinage Act of
1849.) In fact it reaffirmed that "the money of account of the United
States shall be expressed in dollars or units" and again defined those units
as coins containing 371.25 grains of pure silver.
What Congress did do was
authorize the minting of a gold coin and arbitrarily fix the value of the
gold in that coin at fifteen times the value of the dollar. And it also
stated that all silver and gold coins produced in the federal mint were to
be legal tender in accordance with their value, based on weight and purity,
relative to the standard of the silver dollar.
Oh yes, another thing. It set the death penalty for anyone who debases the
nation's coinage; a law which, if enforced today, would wipe out the House
of Representatives, the Senate, the managerial level of the Treasury
Department, and the Presidency as well.
FREE COINAGE
Perhaps the most important provision of this Act, however, was the
establishment of what is called free coinage. Under free coinage, any
citizen may take raw silver or gold to the mint and, for a nominal fee, have
it converted into coins for personal use.
The government merely performs a
technical function of creating the coin and stamping it with its insignia to
certify the correct weight and purity. The state's role in this is exactly
the same as inspecting the scales in a grocery store or the meter on a
gasoline pump.
It is merely fulfilling the Constitutional requirement to
set standards and verify the accuracy of weights and measures.
Free coinage was to become an important part of the American success story,
and it lasted until the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 which, not only terminated
it, but even made it illegal for citizens to possess gold. We shall take a
closer look at that dismal period in a
later section but, for now, it is important to recall the greatness of our
monetary system as it once was.
Elgin Groseclose explains:
The principle of free coinage has proved its practical worth as a deterrent
to debasement and depreciation. Where coinage is on private account there is
no profit to the state in tampering with the standard, and there is no
opportunity for such practice by the individual.
The circulation of coins of
similar appearance and denomination but of uncertain standard, the arbitrary
and unpredictable modifications in the standard by autocratic government,
the temptations to profit which were constantly dangled before despotic
rulers - these were evils which had perplexed and harassed society and
hindered the natural growth of economy since the days when coined money
first appeared.
By a stroke they were swept away. At the same time, the
institution of free coinage, by giving stability and character to one of the
chief instruments of organized economy, made possible a more vigorous and
healthy commercial life and gave prestige and increased substance to the
government adopting it.1
SOUND MONEY AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY
This was, indeed, an auspicious beginning for the new nation, and the result
was immediately observable in an upsurge in prosperity.
The December 16,
1789 edition of the Pennsylvania Gazette declared:
"Since the federal
constitution has removed all danger of our having a paper tender, our trade
is advanced fifty per cent."2
But that was just the beginning.
Historian
Douglass North says that,
"the years 1793-1808, were years of unparalleled
prosperity."3
Louis Hacker describes the period as one,
"of unexampled
business expansion, one of the greatest, in fact, the United States has
had... The exports of the country mounted from $19 millions in 1791 to $93
millions in 1801."4

W.WNorton, 1966), p. 53.

Furthermore, the federal deficit, which amounted to
twenty-eight per cent of expenditures in 1792, dropped to twenty-one per
cent in 1795. By 1802, the deficit had disappeared altogether and had been
replaced by a surplus that was almost as large as the government's total
spending.
George Washington watched this economic miracle with great satisfaction and,
in correspondence to his friend, LaFayette, the
French statesman and former General in the Continental Army, Washington
commented:
"Our country, my dear sir,... is fast progressing in its
political importance and social happiness."
In a letter to Catherine
Macaulay Graham, he said:
"The United States enjoys a sense of prosperity
and tranquility under the new government that could hardly have been hoped
for."
And in a letter to the American poet and diplomat, David Humphreys,
Washington exclaimed:
"Our public credit stands on that high ground which
three years ago it would have been considered as a species of madness to
have foretold."1
On the specific subject of paper money without backing by gold or silver,
Washington wrote:
We may one day become a great commercial and flourishing nation. But if in
the pursuit of the means we should unfortunately stumble again on unfunded
paper money or any similar species of fraud, we shall assuredly give a fatal
stab to our national credit in its infancy.2
1- These letters were written in 1790 and 1791, quoted by At wood, pp. 5-6.
2- Written in 1789, quoted by Louis Basso, A Treatise on Monetary Reform (St.
Louis,
Missouri: Monetary Realist Society, 1982), p. 5.
This, then, was the monetary blueprint laid down by the men who drafted our
Constitution In retrospect, about the only flaw one can find was the attempt
to set a fixed ratio between the value of gold and silver. Rather than
placing a dollar value on a gold coin, the mint should have imprinted the
gold value in terms of weight and fineness.
The free market then would have
assigned it an exchange value in terms of goods and services, and that
automatically would have determined its correct monetary value as a ratio to
the silver dollars which were bidding for the purchase of the same items. It
was inevitable, therefore, that soon after the "ten-dollar" Eagle was
created, the value of gold over silver began to climb higher than the
prescribed ratio of fifteen-to-one, and the Eagles ceased to circulate.
In
later years, with the discovery of the great gold fields in California and
Australia, the process reversed itself, and silver dollars disappeared from
commerce.
But, even though this bimetallism led to a discrepancy between the
actual conversion ratio and that which the government had prescribed,
nevertheless, it took place in the open market and no one was greatly
injured by the inconvenience. Throughout it all, there was just one
standard: the defined silver content of a dollar. Furthermore, both the
silver and gold coins were of intrinsic value and totally honest in their
measure.
No nation could do more for the prosperity of its citizens than
that.
SUMMARY
The Constitution prohibits both the states and the federal government from
issuing fiat money.
This was the deliberate intent of the Founding Fathers
who had bitter experience with fiat money before and especially during the
Revolutionary War. In response to the need to have a precisely defined
national monetary unit, Congress adopted the Spanish dollar then currently
in use and defined the content of that dollar to be 371.25 grains of pure
silver.
With the establishment of a federal mint, American silver dollars
were issued in accordance with that standard, and gold Eagles also were
produced which were then equal in value to ten silver dollars.
Most
importantly, free coinage was established wherein Americans were able to
convert their raw silver and gold into national coins officially certified
by the government as to their intrinsic value. The product of these measures
was a period of sound money and great economic prosperity, a period that
would come to an end only when the next generation of Americans forgot to
read their history and returned to the use of paper money and "bills of
credit."
The monetary plan laid down by the Founding Fathers was the product of
collective genius.
Nowhere in history can one find so many men in one
legislative body who understood the fraud inherent in fiat money and the
hidden-taxation nature of inflation. There was never such an assembly of
scholars and statesmen determined to set a safe course for the nation of
their own creation. Literally, they handed us a treasure map. All we had to
do was follow it to economic security and national prosperity.
But, as we
shall see in the following sections, that map was discarded when the lessons
of history died out with tlu^se who had lived it.
Chapter Sixteen
THE CREATURE COMES TO AMERICA
The story of the Bank of North America, the nation's first central bank,
which was formed even before the Constitution was drafted; the story of the
First Bank of the United States, the nation's second central bank, which was
formed in 1791; the massive inflation caused by both banks; the causes of
their demise.
It is a surprising fact that the United States had its first central bank
even before the Constitution was drafted.
It was chartered by the
Continental Congress in the Spring of 1781 and opened its doors the
following year. There were great expectations at that time that the province
of Canada would soon join the rebel colonies to form a union extending
across the entire North American continent. In anticipation of that, the new
financial institution was called the Bank of North America.
The Bank was organized by Robert Morris, a member of Congress, who was a
leader of a group of politicians and merchants who wanted the new nation to
imitate the mercantilism of England. They wanted high taxes to support a
powerful, centralized government, high tariffs to subsidize domestic
industry, a large army and navy, and the acquisition of colonial outposts to
expand into foreign lands and markets.
He was a wealthy Philadelphia
merchant who had profited greatly from war contracts during the Revolution.
He had carefully studied the secret science of money and, by 1781, was
widely considered to be the financial wizard of Congress.
The Bank of North America was modeled closely after the Bank of England.
Following the practice of fractional reserve, it was allowed to issue paper
promissory notes in excess of actual deposits, but, since some gold and
silver had to be held in the vault,
there were definite limits to how far that process could go. Bank notes were
not forced on the people as legal tender for all debts, public and private,
but the government did agree to accept them at their face value in payment
of all taxes and duties, which made them as good as gold for that specific
purpose.
Furthermore, unlike the central banks of today, the Bank of North
America was not given the power to directly issue the nation's money.
FUNCTIONED AS A CENTRAL BANK
On the other hand, the Bank was given the right of monopoly in its field,
which means there were no other bank notes allowed to circulate in
competition.
This, plus the fact that they were accepted at face value in
payment of all federal and state taxes, plus the further fact that the
federal government did not at that time have a functioning money of its own,
made these bank notes attractive for use as a circulating medium of
exchange. The intended result was that the Bank's paper would be accepted as
money, which for a while, it was.
Furthermore, the Bank was made the
official depository for all federal funds and it almost immediately loaned
$1.2 million to the government, much of which was created out of nothing for
that purpose. So, in spite of the limitations placed upon the Bank, and in
spite of the fact that it was essentially a private institution, it was
intended to be and, in fact, did function as a central bank.
The Bank of North America was fraudulent from the very start. The charter
required that private investors provide $400,000 for the initial
subscription. When Morris was unable to raise that money, he used his
political influence to make up the shortfall out of government funds. In a
maneuver that was nothing less than legalized embezzlement, he took the gold
that had been loaned to the United States from France and had it deposited
in the Bank.
Then, using this as a fractional-reserve base, he simply
created the money that was needed for the subscription and loaned it to
himself and his associates. Such is the power of the secret science.
It is hard to reconcile the fact that the same men who adopted the brilliant
monetary restraints of the Constitution a few years later would have allowed
the Bank of North America to exist. It must be remembered, however, that the
war was still in progress when the charter was issued, and even the wisest
of statesmen are often obliged to follow expediency in such times.
One also
must conclude that, while the founding fathers were wise on the nature of
fiat money created by the government's printing press, they had not yet had
extensive experience with the same mechanism hidden behind the obscurities
of fractional-reserve banking.
In any event, the Bank was not to have its charter renewed by Congress and
it did not survive beyond the end of the war.
Murray Rothbard details its
demise:
Despite the monopoly privileges conferred upon the Bank of North America and
its nominal redeemability in specie, the market's lack of confidence in the
inflated notes led to their depreciation outside the Bank's home base in
Philadelphia.
The Bank even tried to bolster the value of its notes by
hiring people to urge redeemers of its notes not to insist on specie - a
move scarcely calculated to improve the long-run confidence in the Bank.
After a year of operation, Morris's political power slipped, and he moved
quickly to shift the Bank of North America from a central bank to a purely
commercial bank chartered by the state of Pennsylvania. By the end of
1783,... the first experiment with a central bank in the United States had
ended.1
1- Rothbard, Mystery, pp. 194-95.
A fitting epilogue to this story was written two hundred years later when,
in 1980, the First Pennsylvania Bank of Philadelphia, the "oldest bank in
the nation," was bailed out by the FDIC.
AN END RUN AROUND THE CONSTITUTION
It will be recalled that, after the Bank of North America was terminated and
after the Constitutional Convention "closed the door on paper money," the
United States enjoyed a period of unparalleled economic growth and
prosperity.
But, while the door may have been closed, the window was still
open. Congress was denied the power to print money, but it was not denied
the power to borrow it.
In the vocabulary of the common man, to borrow is to accept a loan of
something that already exists. He is confused, therefore, when the banker
issues money out of nothing and then says he is lending it. He appears to be
lending but, in reality, he is creating.
Then, as now, the mysteries of banking vocabulary were not revealed to the
average man, and it was difficult to understand
how privately-issued bank notes could serve precisely the same purpose as
printing-press money - with precisely the same disastrous results. That
being the case, the monetary and political scientists decided to end run the
Constitution.
Their plan was to establish a bank, to give that bank the
power to create money, to lend most of that money to the government, and
then to make sure the IOUs are accepted as money by the public. Congress,
therefore, would not be emitting bills of credit. The bank would do that.
Thus, the First Bank of the United States was conceived.
The proposal was
submitted to Congress in 1790 by Alexander Hamilton who, at that time, was
Secretary of the Treasury. Hamilton, incidentally, was a former aide to
Robert Morris, founder of the Bank of North America, so in that sense his
role in this matter is not surprising. What is surprising is the fact that
Hamilton had been a staunch supporter of a sound currency during the
Constitutional Convention.
This is hard to reconcile, and one must suspect
that, even the most well intentioned of men can become corrupted by the
temptations of wealth and power. It is possible that Hamilton, Morris, and
other Federalist leaders had hoped to keep the government out of the
money-making business, not because it was the constitutional thing to do,
but because that would leave the field clear for a central-bank mechanism
which, because it was further from public view and political control, could
become their own private engine of profit.
It would appear that the only
other explanation is that these men were fickle in their views and did not
really understand the implications of their acts.
In view of their
brilliance in all other matters, however, it is difficult to muster
enthusiasm for that interpretation.
THE HAMILTON-JEFFERSON CONFLICT
Hamilton's proposal was strongly opposed by Thomas Jefferson, then Secretary
of State, and this was the beginning of a heated political debate that would
preoccupy Congress for many decades to come. In fact, it was one of the
central issues that led to the creation of our first political parties.
The
Federalists gathered around the ideas of Hamilton. The anti-Federalists,
later called the Republicans, were attracted to the ideas of Jefferson.1
1. Curiously, the present Democratic Party traces its origin to Jefferson's
Republicans.
Jefferson pointed out that the Constitution did not grant to Congress the
power to create a bank or anything similar. That means such power is
reserved to the states or to the people. In a rebuttal to Hamilton's
proposal, he said:
"To take a single step beyond the boundaries thus
specially drawn around the powers of Congress, is to take possession of a
boundless field of power, no [longer susceptible of any definition."1
Furthermore, he said, even if the Constitution had granted such power, it
would be an extremely unwise thing to do, because allowing banks to create
money could only lead to national ruin.
Hamilton, on the other hand, argued that debt was a good thing, if kept
within reason, and that the nation needed more money in circulation to keep
up with expanding commerce. Only the Bank, he said, would be able to provide
that.
Furthermore, while it is true the Constitution did not specifically
grant the power to create such a bank, it was, nevertheless, an implied
power, because it was needed to accomplish other functions which were
granted in the Constitution.
That was the end run.
Nothing could be more polarized than the opposing ideas of these two men:
JEFFERSON: MA private central bank issuing the public currency is a greater
menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army."2
"We must not
let our rulers load us with perpetual debt."3
HAMILTON: "No society could succeed which did not unite the interest and
credit of rich individuals with those of the state."4
"A national debt, if
it is not excessive, will be to us a national blessing."5

H. Makin, The Global Debt Crisis: America's Growing Involvement (New York:

AMERICA'S SECOND CENTRAL BANK IS CREATED
After a year of intense debate, Hamilton's views prevailed and, in 1791,
Congress granted a twenty-year charter to the Bank of the
United States.
It was modeled closely after the Bank of England, which
means it was almost an exact replica of the previous Bank of North America.
In fact, as evidence of continuity with the past, the president of the new
bank was Thomas Willing, the same man who had been a partner of Robert
Morris and president of the old bank.1
As before, the new Bank was given a monopoly in the issuance of bank notes.
Once again, these notes were not forced on the people as legal tender for
private debts and contracts, but they were legal tender at face value for
all debts to the government in the form of taxes and duties, which made them
attractive for use as common money.
And once again, the Bank was made the
official depository of all federal funds.
The charter specified that the Bank was required at all rimes to redeem its
notes in gold or silver specie upon demand by the depositor. That was an
admirable provision but, since the Bank was not also required to keep specie
in its vaults in the full amount of its note obligations, it was a
mathematical impossibility to uphold.
As with the old Bank of North America, the new Bank of the United States was
to have eighty per cent of its capital provided by private investors with
the federal government putting up only twenty per cent. That was a mere
bookkeeping sleight-of-hand, however, because it had been prearranged for
the Bank to immediately loan back to the federal government exactly that
same amount.
Reminiscent of the Morris scheme in capitalizing the Bank of
North America, this federal "investment" was essentially a means whereby
federal funds could be used to make up the short-fall of the private
investors.
"Call it by what name you please," said Jefferson, this was not a
loan or an investment but an outright gift.
And he was certainly right. The
Bank was able to open its doors with less than nine per cent of the private
capital required by its charter. The total capitalization was specified at
$10 million, which means that $8 million was to come from private
stockholders.
However, as John Kenneth Galbraith wryly observed:
"Numerous
thrifty participants confined themselves to a modest down payment, and the
bank began operations on around $675,000 in hard cash."2
1.It is interesting to note that, as a
member of the Continental Congress, Willing had been one of those who voted
against the Declaration of Independence.
2. Galbraith, p. 72
THE CREATURE COMES FROM EUROPE
Who were these private investors?
Their names do not appear in the published
literature, but we can be certain they included the Congressmen and Senators
- and their associates - who engineered the charter. But there is an
interesting line in Galbraith's text that hints at another dimension to the
composition of this group.
On page 72 of Money: Whence It Came, Where It
Went, he states matter-of-factly:
"Foreigners could own shares but not vote them."
What a story is hidden behind that innocuous statement. The blunt reality
is that the Rothschild banking dynasty in Europe was the dominant force,
both financially and politically, in the formation of the Bank of the United
States.
Biographer, Derek Wilson, explains:
Over the years since N.M. [Rothschild], the Manchester textile manufacturer,
had bought cotton from the Southern states, Rothschilds had developed heavy
American commitments. Nathan... had made loans to various states of the
Union, had been, for a time, the official European banker for the US
government and was a pledged supporter of the Bank of the United States.1
Gustavus Myers, in his History of the Great American Fortunes, is more
pointed.
He says:
Under the surface, the Rothschilds long had a powerful influence in
dictating American financial laws. The law records show that they were the
power in the old Bank of the United States.2
The Rothschilds, therefore, were not merely investors nor just an important
power.
They were the power behind the Bank of the United States! The
significance of the Rothschild power in American finance and politics was
the subject of extensive comment in a previous section, so there is no need
to cover that ground again. It is important here, however, to at least make
a mental note of the fact that the Creature from Jekyll Island is descended
from a species that is not native to this land.

House, 1936), p. 556.
INFLATION ALL OVER AGAIN
From the beginning, the primary purpose of the Bank was to create money for
the federal government. Money for the private
sector was strictly secondary.
That was made clear by the fact that the
maximum rate of interest it was allowed to charge was six per cent. That
made it impractical to make loans to anyone except the federal government
and a few large, prime-rate borrowers.
And the government wasted no time
putting its new central-bank mechanism to work. Having "invested" $2 million
at the start, it converted that into $8.2 million borrowed within the next
five years. Which means that $6.2 million was created specifically for its
use.
Anyone familiar with the history of money as outlined in the previous
section could easily write the following paragraph.
The creation of millions of new fractional-reserve dollars, which the
government pushed into the economy through spending programs, caused an
imbalance between the supply of money and the supply of goods and services.
Prices appeared to go up as the relative value of the dollar went down.
In
that same five-year period, wholesale prices rose by 72%, which is another
way of saying that 42% of everything people had saved in the form of money
was quietly confiscated by the government through the hidden tax called
inflation.
The same inflation effect that previously had plagued the colonies now
returned to plague the new generation. This time, instead of being caused by
printing-press money, it was fractional-reserve money. The cog that linked
the two mechanisms together and caused them to function as one was federal
debt.
It was federal debt that allowed the political and monetary scientists
to violate the intent of the founding fathers, and it was this same federal
debt that prompted Jefferson to exclaim:
I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I
would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the
administration of our government to the general principle of the
Constitution; I mean an additional article, taking from the federal
government their power of borrowing.1
Like so many things in the real world, the Bank of the United States was a
mixture of evil with some good.
It certainly was not all bad. In colonial
times, the state governments printed as much paper money as they pleased,
and the loss of purchasing power was, in many cases, total. The Bank, on the
other hand, was required to maintain some gold and specie as a base for its pyramid of
money.
Even though it was an inverted pyramid with reserves being smaller
than the quantity of bank notes, it still represented a boundary to just how
far the money supply could be expanded. And that was good.
Furthermore, it is apparent that the bank's directors were imbued with a
certain amount of enlightened self interest in that they actually wanted to
keep the creation of new money within some kind of control. They could
profit from the central-bank mechanism only so long as the economy as a
whole was productive enough to support it. They did not want to kill the
goose that laid the golden egg.
So, like their counterparts in the Federal
Reserve System of our modern day, they spoke the language of restraint and,
in a few instances, even acted with restraint as well.
WILDCAT BANKS
For example, it was during this period that "wildcat banks" began to
flourish.
They were given that name not because they were untamed - although
that would have been another good reason to do so - but because they were
located in areas so remote in the frontier that it was said their only
customers were wildcats.
Wildcat banks were not noted for meticulous accounting or business
practices. Like all banks at that time, they were required to keep a certain
portion of their deposits on hand in the form of gold or silver coin.
To
engender public confidence in their faithfulness to that obligation, it was
common practice to keep the vault door open so a keg or two of gold coins
could be viewed during business hours - not altogether different from the
modern practice of financial institutions advertising how many billions in
assets they hold but never mentioning the size of their liabilities.
The
wildcatters, however, were not reluctant to sprinkle a few precious-metal
coins over the top of nails and let that take care of public relations. In
some cases, as state examiners went from bank to bank to check the reserves,
the gold would arrive only a few minutes ahead of them, having been rushed
from the vault of the bank previously audited.
The point is that the Bank of the United States was able to place
considerable restraint upon the practices of all banks, both wildcat and
urban. It did this simply by refusing to accept the notes of any other bank
unless it had a reputation for redeeming those notes in specie on demand.
The public reacted accordingly.
If the notes were not good enough for the
Bank of the United States, they were not good enough for them either. This
served as an indirect force of moderation that affected all banks of that
time. And that, too, was good.
Some historians have said that the Bank was a positive force in yet another
way.
Galbraith, for example, writes admiringly:
On occasion, the Bank of the United States came to the assistance of good
state banks that were being besieged by their note holders or other
creditors. So, besides enforcing restraint, it served also as the lender of
last resort. Thus in its short span of life it went far to perceive and
develop the basic regulatory functions of a central bank.1
One who is less enamored with the idea of a central bank would be tempted to
ask:
If those state banks were so "good," why did they need assistance in
keeping faith with their depositors?
The whole idea of a "lender of last
resort," which is accepted as sacred dogma today, is based on the assumption
that it is perfectly acceptable for the entire banking system to be
fraudulent.
It is assumed that any single bank or cluster of banks could at
any time become "besieged by their note holders or other creditors."
Therefore, it is prudent to have a central bank to take what meager reserves
there are within the system and rush them from bank to bank, if not minutes
before the examiner arrives, at least before the customers do.
As for the much talked about restraint exercised over other banks, it is not
unreasonable to think that this same effect would have developed even
without the presence of a government bank. If the free market had been left
to operate, it is certain that, before long, one or more banks would gain a
deserved reputation for honesty and full faith with their depositors.
They
would become the most popular banks and, therefore, the most prosperous. In
order to accomplish this, however, they would have to reject the worthless
notes of other banks. The public would react as expected, and even the most
unscrupulous banks would have to toe the line if they wanted to survive.
Moderation would be forced on the entire banking system as a result of open
competition within a free market.
To assume that only a federally-chartered
central bank could have brought moderation into the monetary system is to
believe that only politicians, bureaucrats, and agencies of government can
act with integrity, a shaky notion at best.
AN INSTRUMENT OF PLUTOCRACY
In any event, there is no denying the fact that the Bank of the United
States did provide some braking force to the runaway tendencies of many of
the nation's private banks. So it could have been worse.
The inflation that
it caused by its own activities could have been enlarged even further by the
activities of the other banks as well. But, that it could have been worse
does not make it good. As it was, the Bank was the means by which the
American people lost forty-two per cent of the value of all the money they
earned or possessed during just those five years.
We must not forget,
either, that this confiscation of property was selective. It did not work
against the wealthy classes which were able to ride the wave of inflation
aboard the raft of tangible property which they owned. And it especially did
not work against those elite few, the political and monetary scientists, who
were making huge profits from the enterprise.
The Bank had done precisely
what Hamilton had advocated:
"... unite the interest and credit of rich
individuals with those of the state."
The development of this plutocracy was well described by
Governor Morris,
the former delegate from New York who had helped to draft the Constitution
into its final form.
He had been an assistant to Robert Morris (not related)
and was a champion of the concept of a natural aristocracy. So he knew his
subject well when he warned:
The rich will strive to establish their dominion and enslave the rest. They
always did. They always will... They will have the same effect here as
elsewhere, if we do not, by such a government, keep them within their proper
spheres. We should remember that the people never act from reason alone.
The
rich will take advantage of their passions, and make these the instruments
for oppressing them. The result of the contest will be a violent
aristocracy, or a more violent despotism.1
1- Written on July 2, 1787, in a letter to James Madison. Quoted in
"Prosperity Economics/' by W. Cleon Skousen, Freeman Digest, February, 1985,
p. 9.
The tide of political pressure against the Bank was steadily rising during
these years.
It is tempting for critics of the central-bank mechanism to
attribute that to the awakening common sense of the American public.
Unfortunately, the picture is not that pleasing. It is true that the
Jeffersonian Republicans were eloquently holding forth against the
Creature's progenitor, and their influence was substantial.
But there was
another group that joined with them which had almost exactly opposite ideas
and goals.
The Jeffersonians opposed the Bank because they believed it was
unconstitutional and because they wanted a monetary system based only upon
gold and silver coin. The other group was made up of the wildcatters, the
land speculators, and the empire-building industrialists. They opposed the
Bank because they wanted a monetary system with no restraints at all, not
even those associated with fractional reserve.
They wanted every local bank
to be free to create as much paper money as the public would swallow,,
because they would then use that money for their own projects and profit.
Indeed, politics does produce strange bedfellows.
As the time approached for renewal of the Bank's charter, the battle lines
inched toward each other. They were of equal force. The halls of Congress
echoed with the cannon roar of angry debate. The vote was deadlocked.
Another attack and counter attack. Again a deadlock. Into the night the
forces clashed.
When the smoke of battle lifted, the bill for charter renewal had been
defeated by one vote in the House and one vote, cast by Vice-President
George Clinton to break the tie, in the Senate. And so, on January 24, 1811,
the Bank of the United States closed its doors.
The battle may have been decided, but the war was far from over. The losers,
bitter with defeat, merely regrouped their forces and began to prepare for
the next encounter. Unfortunately, the events that followed were ideally
suited for their plans.
With the moderating effect of the Bank now removed from the scene, the
nation's banking system passed wholly into the hands of the state-chartered
corporations, many of which were imbued with the wildcat mentality. Their
numbers grew rapidly, and so did the money supply which they created.
Inflation followed in their footsteps. Public dissatisfaction began to rise.
If the free market had been allowed to operate, it is likely that
competition soon would have weeded out the wildcatters and restored balance
to the system, but it was never given a chance.
The War of 1812 saw to that.
THE WAR OF 1812
The War of 1812 was one of the most senseless wars in history.
The primary
cause, we are told, was the British impressments into their navy of American
sailors on the high seas to assist in the war against Napoleonic France. But
the French had done exactly the same thing to assist in the war against
England, yet their acts were ignored.
Furthermore, the British had already
rescinded their policy regarding American seamen before the war was
underway, which means that the cause of the war had been removed, and peace
could have been restored in honor if Congress had so wanted. One must
conclude that the pro-banking interests in the United States actually wanted
the conflict because of the profits that could be realized from it.
As
evidence of this is the fact that the New England states, which were home to
the seamen who had been impressed into service, were firmly against the war,
while the Western and inland Southern states, which were home to the myriad
of wildcat banks, howled loudly for a clash of arms.
In any event, the war was unpopular with the average citizen, and it was out
of the question for Congress to obtain funding for armaments through an
increase in taxes. So the government needed the state banks to create that
money outside the tax structure and came to their rescue to protect them
from the discipline of the free market.
It was a classic case of the unholy
alliance, the cabal, that always develops between political and monetary
scientists.
Professor Rothbard gives the details:
The U.S. government encouraged an enormous
expansion in the number of banks and in bank notes and deposits to
purchase the growing war debt. These new and recklessly inflationary
banks in the Middle Atlantic, Southern, and Western states, printed
enormous quantities of new notes to purchase government bonds. The
federal government then used these notes to purchase arms and
manufactured goods in New England...
By August 1814, it became clear that the
banks of the nation apart from New England could not pay [in specie],
that they were insolvent. Rather than allow the banks of the nation to
fail, the governments, state and federal, decided in August 1814 to
allow the banks to continue in business while refusing to redeem their
obligations in specie. In other words, the banks were allowed to refuse
to pay their solemn contractual obligations...
This general suspension was not only highly inflationary at the time; it set
a precedent for all financial crises from then on. Whether
the U.S. had a central bank or not, the banks were assured that if they
inflated together and then got in trouble, government would bail them out.1

The state banks had created enough instant money for the federal government
to raise the debt from $45 million to $127 million, a staggering sum for the
fledgling nation.
Tripling the money supply, with no appreciable increase in
goods, means the value of the dollar shrank to about one-third its former
purchasing power. By 1814, when the depositors began to awake to the scam
and demanded their gold instead of paper, the banks closed their doors and
had to hire extra guards to protect officials and employees from the angry
crowds.
Once again, the monetary and political scientists had succeeded in
fleecing the American public of approximately 66% of all the money they held
during that period, and that was on top of the 42% fleecing they got a few
years earlier by the Bank of the United States.
JUGGLING TRICKS AND BANKING DREAMS
Leaning against the storm of paper money all this time was Thomas Jefferson,
by now, past-President of the United States.
Trying to bring the nation to
its senses, he never ceased speaking out against the evil of dishonest money
and debt:
Although all the nations of Europe have tried and trodden every path of
force and folly in a fruitless quest of the same object, yet we still expect
to find in juggling tricks and banking dreams, that money can be made out of
nothing, and in sufficient quantity to meet the expense of heavy war.2
The toleration of banks of paper discount
costs the United States one-half of their war taxes; or, in other words,
doubles the expenses of every war.3
2. Writings, Library Edition, Vol. XIV, p. 227.
3. Writings, Library Edition, Vol. XIII, p. 364.
The crisis, then, of the abuses of banking
is arrived. The banks have pronounced their own sentence of death.
Between two and three hundred millions of dollars of their promissory
notes are in the hands of the people, for solid produce and property
sold, and they [the banks] formally declare that they will not pay
them...
Paper was received on a belief that it was
cash [gold], and such scenes are now to take place as will open the eyes
of credulity and of insanity itself to the dangers of a paper medium
abandoned to the discretion of avarice and of swindlers.1
It is a wise rule never to borrow a dollar without laying a tax at the same
instant for paying the interest annually and the principal within a given
term.2
We shall consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with
our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves.3 ... The earth belongs
to the living, not the dead... We may consider each generation as a
distinct nation with a right to ... bind themselves, but not the succeeding
generation.4
The modern theory of the perpetuation of debt has drenched the earth with
blood, and crushed its inhabitants under burdens ever accumulating.5
And still, Congress did not listen.

SUMMARY
America had its first central bank even before the Constitution was drafted.
It was called the Bank of North America and was chartered by the Continental
Congress in 1781.
Modeled after the Bank of England, it was authorized to
issue more paper promissory notes than it held in deposits. In the
beginning, these notes were widely circulated and served as a national
currency. Although the bank was essentially a private institution, it was
designed for the purpose of creating money to lend to the federal
government, which it did from the start.
The Bank of North America was riddled with fraud, and it quickly fell into
political disfavor. Its inflated bank notes eventually were rejected by
ordinary citizens and ceased to circulate outside of the Bank's home city of
Philadelphia. Its charter was allowed to expire and, in 1783, it was
converted into a purely commercial bank chartered by the state of
Pennsylvania.
The advocates of fiat money did not give up. In 1791, the First Bank of the
United States (America's second central bank) was created by Congress. The
new bank was a replica of the first, including fraud. Private investors in
the Bank were among the nation's most wealthy and influential citizens,
including some Congressmen and Senators. But the largest investment and the
most powerful influence in the new Bank came from the Rothschilds in Europe.
The Bank set about immediately to serve its function of creating money for
the government. This led to a massive inflation of the money supply and
rising prices. In the first five years, 42% of everything people had saved
in the form of money was confiscated through the hidden tax called
inflation. This was the same phenomenon that had plagued the colonies less
than two decades earlier, but instead of being caused by printing-press
money, it was now fueled by fractional-reserve bank notes created by a
central bank.
As the time for renewal of the Bank's charter approached, two groups with
opposite intentions became strange political allies against it:
the Jeffersonians who wanted sound money; and the frontier banks, called
wildcatters, who wanted unlimited license to steal.
On January 24, 1811, the
charter was defeated by one vote in the Senate and one in the House. The
central bank was gone, but the wildcatters were everywhere.
The War of 1812 was not popular among the American public, and funding would
have been impossible through taxes alone.
The government chose to fund the
war by encouraging wildcat banks to purchase its war-debt bonds and convert
them into bank notes which the government then used to purchase war
material. Within two years, the nation's money supply had tripled, and so
had prices. Once again, the monetary and political scientists had succeeded
in fleecing the American public of approximately 66% of all the money they
held during that period.
And that was on top of the 42% fleecing they got a
few years earlier by the Bank of the United States.
Chapter Seventeen
A DEN OF VIPERS
The story of the Second Bank of the United States, the nation's third
central bank; the election of Andrew Jackson on an anti-bank platform; the
battle between President Jackson and the head of the bank, Nicholas Biddle;
the deliberate creation of a depression to frighten the public into keeping
the bank; Jackson's ultimate victory.
The monetary chaos that existed at the end of the War of 1812, outlined in
the previous chapter, was caused by an almost universal fraud within the
banking industry. Depositors in good faith placed their gold and silver into
banks for safekeeping and for the convenience of using paper money in their
everyday transactions.
The banks, in turn, promised them they could exchange
the paper for their coins whenever they wished.
At the same time, however,
through the mechanism of fractional-reserve banking, paper money was created
far in excess of the value of the coins held in reserve.
Since the new money
had just as much claim to the coins as the old, the bankers knew that, if a
sizable percentage of their customers were to request a withdrawal of their
coins, that solemn promise simply could not be kept. This, in fact, is
precisely what happened over and over again during that period.
By 1814, Thomas Jefferson had retired to Monticello and had bitterly
resigned himself to defeat on the issue of money. In a letter to John Adams
he said:
I have ever been the enemy of banks; not of those discounting for cash [that
is, charging interest on loans of real money], but of those foisting their
own paper into circulation, and thus banishing our cash.
My zeal against
those institutions was so warm and open at the establishment of the bank of
the U.S. that I was derided as a Maniac by the tribe of bank-mongers, who
were seeking to filch from the public their swindling and barren gains...
Shall we build an altar to the old paper money of the revolution, which
ruined individuals but saved the republic, and burn on that all the bank
charters present and future,
and their notes with them?
For these are to ruin both republic and
individuals. This cannot be done. The Mania is too strong. It has seized by
its delusions and corruptions all the members of our governments, general,
special, and individual.1

Schuster, 1971), Vol. II, p. 424.
Jefferson was right.
Congress had neither the wisdom nor the courage to let
the free market clean up the mess that remained after the demise of the
first bank of the U.S. If it had, the fraud soon would have become
understood by the public, the dishonest banks would have folded, the losses
would have been taken, and the suffering would have been ended, perhaps
forever. Instead, Congress moved to protect the banks, to organize the
fraud, and to perpetuate the losses.
All of this was accomplished in 1816
when a twenty-year charter was given to the Second Bank of the United
States.
THE SECOND BANK OF THE UNITED STATES
In every respect the new bank was a carbon copy of the old, with one minor
exception.
Congress unashamedly extracted from the private investors what
amounted to nothing less than a bribe in the form of $1.5 million,
"in
consideration of the exclusive privileges and benefits conferred by this
Act."2
The bankers were glad to pay the fee, not only because it was a
modest price for such a profitable enterprise, but also because, as before,
they received an immediate government deposit of one-fifth the total
capitalization which then was used as the base for manufacturing much of the
remaining startup capital.
The charter required the Bank to raise a minimum
of $7 million in specie, but even in its second year of operation, its
specie never rose above $2.5 million.3
Once again, the monetary and political
scientists had carved out their profitable niches, and the gullible
taxpayer, his head filled with sweet visions of "banking reform," was left
to pick up the tab.
Another important continuity between the old and the new Bank was the
concentration of foreign investment. In fact, the largest single block of
stock in the new Bank, about one-third in all, was held by this group.4

It
is certainly no exaggeration to say that the Second Bank of the United
States was rooted as deeply in Britain as it was in America.
The nation's third central bank ran into deep trouble from the start. It had
promised to continue the tradition of moderating the other banks by refusing
to accept any of their notes unless they were redeemable in specie on
demand. But when the other banks returned the gesture and required that the
new Bank also pay out specie on their demand, it frequently lost its
resolve.
There was also the tiny matter of corruption.
As the Bank's major
historian writes:
"So many influential people were interested [in the state
banks] as stockholders that it was not advisable to give offense by
demanding payment in specie, and borrowers were anxious to keep the banks in
the humor to lend."1
In economics, every policy carries a consequence, and the consequence of the
loose monetary policy of the Second Bank of the United States was that
America was introduced to her first experience with what now is called the
"boom-bust" cycle.
Galbraith tells us:
"In 1816, the postwar boom was full
on; there was especially | active speculation in western lands. The new Bank
joyously participated."2
The Bank had the advantage over its competitors of a federal charter plus
the government's agreement to accept its notes in the payment of taxes.
But
the state banks were by no means left out of the game. It was still within
their power to create money through 1 fractional-reserve banking and, thus,
to further inflate the amount of the nation's circulating currency. Anxious
to get in on this action, Pennsylvania chartered thirty-seven new banks in
1817. That same year, Kentucky followed suit with forty new charters.
The
total number of banks grew by 46% in just the first two years after the
central bank was created.
Any spot along the road that had,
"a church, a
tavern, or a blacksmith shop was deemed a suitable place for setting up a
bank."3
In that same time frame, the money supply was expanded by an
additional $27.4 million; another taxpayer fleecing of over forty per cent
THE FIRST BOOM-BUST CYCLE
In the past, the effect of this inflationary process always had been the
gradual evaporation of purchasing power and the continuous transfer of
property from those who produced it to those who controlled the government
and ran the banks. This time, however, the process took on a new twist.
Gradualism was replaced by catastrophism.
The monetary scientists, with
their hands firmly on the controls of the money machine, now began to throw
the levers, first one way, and then the other. The expansion and then
deliberate contraction of the money supply literally threw the nation into
economic convulsions. Why wait for the apples to fall when the harvest can
be hastened simply by shaking the tree?
In 1818, the Bank suddenly began to tighten its requirements for new loans
and to call in as many of the old loans as possible.
This contraction of the
money supply was justified to the public then exactly as it is justified
today. It was necessary, they said, to put the brakes on inflation. The fact
that this was the same inflation the Bank had helped to create in the first
place, seems to have gone unnoticed.
There is no doubt that many bankers and politicians act in good faith in
their attempt to bring under control the inflation they themselves have
caused. Not everyone who benefits from the central-bank mechanism fully
understands it. Like Frankenstein, they create a monster without realizing
they cannot control it. Their crime is one of stupidity, not malice.
But
stupidity is not a characteristic of the average banker, especially a
central banker, and we must conclude that many of the monetary scientists
are well aware of the monster's power for destruction.
At best, they just
don't care as long as they are safe. And at worst, they perceive that they
are in the apple-harvesting business. They deliberately tease and prod the
monster in anticipation of his rampage through the village orchards. In the
final analysis, of course, it is of little importance whether the shaking of
the trees is out of innocence or malice.
The end result is the same. My, how
the apples do fall.
The country's first experience with a deliberately created monetary
contraction began in 1818 when the Bank became concerned about its own
ability to survive.
Professor Rothbard says:
Starting in July 1818, the government and the BUS [Bank of the United
States] began to see what dire straits they were in; the
enormous inflation of money and credit, aggravated by the massive fraud, had
put the BUS in danger of going under and illegally failing to maintain
specie payments.
Over the next year, the BUS began a series of enormous
contractions, forced curtailment of Joans, contractions of credit in the
south and west... The contraction of money and credit swiftly brought to the
United States its first widespread economic and financial depression. The
first nationwide "boom-bust" cycle had arrived in the United States.
The result of this contraction was a rash of defaults, bankruptcies of
business and manufacturers, and a liquidation of unsound investments during
the boom.1
1. Rothbard, Mystery, pp. 204-05. Also see Galbraith, p. 77.
THE CYCLE IS WORSENED BY GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE
It is widely believed that panics, boom-bust cycles, and depressions are
caused by unbridled competition between banks; thus the need for government
regulation.
The truth is just the opposite.
These disruptions in the free
market are the result of government prevention of competition by the
granting of monopolistic power to a central bank. In the absence of a
monopoly, individual banks may operate in a fraudulent manner only to a
limited extent and for a short period of time. Inevitably, they will be
exposed by their more honest competitors and will be forced out of business.
Yes, their depositors will be injured by the bankruptcy, but the damage will
be limited to a relatively few and will occur only now and then.
Even
geographical regions may be hard hit on occasion, but it will not be a
national tragedy with everyone brought to their knees. The overall economy
will absorb the losses, and commerce at large will continue to prosper.
Within an environment of prosperity, even those who have been injured by
fraudulent banking would have a good chance for rapid recovery.
But, when a
central bank is allowed to protect the fraudulent operators and to force all
banks to function the same, the forces of competition can no longer dampen
the effect The expansion becomes universal and gigantic. And, of course, so
does the contraction. Except for the bankers and the politicians, everyone
is injured at the same time; depression is everywhere; and recovery is long
delayed.
This is exactly what happened in the so-called panic of 1819. In the
Documentary History of Banking and Currency, Herman Krooss writes:
The Bank, as the largest creditor [to the state banks], had two
alternatives: it could write off its debts which of course would wipe out
the stockholders' equity and result in bankruptcy, or it could force the
state banks to meet their obligations which would mean wholesale bankruptcy
among state banks.
There was no doubt about the choice... The pressure
placed upon state banks deflated the economy drastically, and as the money
supply wilted, the country sank into severe depression.1
As historian William Gouge observed:
"The Bank was saved, and the people
were ruined."2
Competition between the national Bank and the state banks during this period
had been moved from the open field of the free market to the closed arena of
politics.
Free-market competition had been replaced by government favoritism
in the form of charters which granted the right of monopoly. A federal
charter was clearly better than one issued by a state, but the states fought
back fiercely with what weapons they possessed, and one of those was the
power to tax. Several states began to levy a tax on the paper notes issued
by any bank doing business within their borders which was not also locally
chartered.
The intent, although pretended to be the raising of state
revenue, was really to put the federal Bank out of business.
THE SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS THE BANK
When the Bank refused to pay such a tax to the state of Maryland, the issue
was taken to the Supreme Court in 1819 as the celebrated case of McCulloch
v. Maryland.
The Chief Justice at that time was John Marshall, a leading
Federalist and advocate of a strong, centralized federal government. As was
expected, the Marshall Court carefully tailored its decision to support the
federal government's central bank.
The narrow issue upon which the constitutionality of the Bank was decided
was not whether Congress had the power to directly or indirectly emit bills
of credit or otherwise convert debt into money. If that iiad been the issue,
the Court would have been hard pressed to uphold the Bank, for that not only
is expressly prohibited by the Constitution, it is precisely what the Bank
had been doing all along, and everyone knew it.
Instead, the Court focused
upon the narrow question of whether or not the Bank was a "necessary and
proper" means for Congress to execute any other constitutional powers it
might have. From that perspective, it was unanimously held that the Bank
was, indeed, constitutional.
Were the Bank's paper notes the same as Bills of Credit? No, because they
were backed by the credit of the Bank, not the federal government. True, the
Bank created money, and most of it was used by the government.
Never mind all
that. The Treasury did not print it, therefore, it was not government money.
Was not the Bank the same as an agency of government? No, because merely
granting it a national monopoly and enforcing that monopoly with the power
of the state does not necessarily make it "state action."
Furthermore, the states cannot tax the federal government or any of its
instruments, including the Bank of the United States, because, as Marshall
stated:
"The power to tax is the power to destroy."
Here was another end run around the Constitution, executed this time by the
very men who were assumed to be its most loyal defenders.
The Supreme Court had spoken, but the Court of Public Opinion had not yet
disposed of the case. During the 1820s, popular sentiment shifted back to
the laissez-faire and sound-money principles espoused by the Jeffersonian
Republicans.
But since the Republican Party had by then abandoned those
principles, a new coalition was formed, headed by Martin Van Buren and
Andrew Jackson, to resurrect them. It was called the Democratic Party, and
one of its agenda items was to abolish the Bank of the United States.
After
Jackson was elected to the Presidency in 1828, he wasted no time in
attempting to build Congressional support for that goal.
NICHOLAS BIDDLE
By this time, the Bank had come under the direction of Nicholas Biddle who
was a formidable adversary to Jackson, not only because of the power of his
position, but because of his strong will and sense of personal destiny.
He
was the archetype of the new Eastern Establishment: wealthy, arrogant,
ruthless, and brilliant, he had graduated from the University of
Pennsylvania at the age
of only thirteen, and, as a young man entering business, had fully mastered
the secret science of money.
With the ability to control the flow of the nation's credit, Biddle soon
became one of the most powerful men in America. This was brought out
dramatically when he was asked by a Senate Committee if his bank ever took
advantage of its superior position over the state banks.
He replied:
"Never.
There are very few banks which might not have been destroyed by an exertion
of the powers of the Bank. None has ever been injured."1
As Jackson publicly
noted a few months later, this was an admission that most of the state banks
existed only at the pleasure of the Bank of the United States, and that, of
course, meant at the pleasure of Mr. Biddle.
The year was 1832. The Bank's charter was good for another four years. But
Biddle decided not to wait that long for Jackson to build his forces. He
knew that the President was up for reelection, and he reasoned that, as a
candidate, he would hesitate to be too controversial.
To criticize the Bank
is one thing, but to come down squarely for its elimination altogether would
surely cost him many votes. So, Biddle requested Congress to grant an early
renewal of the charter as a means of softening Jackson's campaign against
it.
The bill was backed by the Republicans led by Senator John Clay and was
passed into law on July 3, just before the election campaigns began in
earnest.
JACKSON OVERRIDES CONGRESS
It was brilliant strategy on Biddle's part but it didn't work. Jackson
decided to place his entire political career on the line for this one issue
and, with perhaps the most passionate message ever delivered to Congress by
any President, before or since, he vetoed the measure.
The President's
biographer, Robert Remini, says:
"The veto message hit the nation like a
tornado. For it not only cited constitutional arguments against recharter -
supposedly the only reason for resorting to a veto - but political, social,
economic, and nationalistic reasons as well."2
Jackson devoted most of his veto message to three general topics:
-
the
injustice that is inherent in granting a government sponsored monopoly to
the Bank
-
the unconstitutionality of the Bank even if it were not
unjust
-
the danger to the country in having the Bank heavily
dominated by foreign investors.
Regarding the injustice of a government-sponsored monopoly, the pointed out
that the stock of the Bank was owned only by the richest citizens of the
country and that, since the sale of stock was limited to a chosen few with
political influence, the common man, not only is unfairly excluded from an
opportunity to participate, but he is forced to pay for his banking services
far more than they are worth.
Unearned profits are bad enough when they are
taken from one class of citizens and given to another, but it is even worse
when the people receiving those benefits are not even citizens at all but
are, in tact foreigners.
Jackson said:
It is not our own citizens only who are to receive the bounty of our
Government.
More than eight millions of the stock of this bank are held by
foreigners. By this act the American Republic proposes virtually to make
them a present of some millions of dollars... It appears that more than a
fourth part of the stock is held by foreigners and the residue is held by a
few hundred of our own citizens, chiefly of the richest class.
For their
benefit does this act exclude the whole American people from competition in
the purchase of this monopoly and dispose of it for many millions less than
it is worth.1
Regarding the issue of constitutionality, he said that he was not bound by
the previous decision of the Supreme Court, because the President and
Congress had just as much right to decide for themselves whether or not a
particular law is constitutional.
This view, incidentally, was not novel at
that time. It is only in relatively recent decades that people have begun to
think of the Supreme Court as being specifically authorized to pass on this
question.
In fact, as Jackson correctly pointed out in his veto message, the
bounding fathers created a government with power divided between the
executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and that the purpose of this
division was, not merely to divvy up the chores, but to balance one branch
against the other.
The goal was not to make government efficient but to
deliberately make it inefficient. Each President and each legislator is
morally bound, even by oath, to uphold the Constitution.
If each of them
does not have the power to decide in conscience what is constitutional, then
taking an oath to uphold it has little meaning.
THE BANK CONTROLLED BY FOREIGN INVESTORS
Regarding the danger to our national security, Jackson returned to the fact
that a major portion of the Bank's stockholders were foreigners.
Even though
foreign investors technically were not allowed to vote their shares, their
financial power was so great that the American investors were clearly
beholden to them and would likely follow their instructions.
Jackson
concluded:
Is there no danger to our liberty and independence in a bank that in its
nature has so little to bind it to our country?... [Is there not] cause to
tremble for the purity of our elections in peace and for the independence of
our country in war?...
Of the course which would be pursued by a bank almost
wholly owned by the subjects of a foreign power, and managed by those whose
interests, if not affections, would run in the same direction there can be
no doubt...
Controlling our currency, receiving our public monies, and
holding thousands of our citizens in dependence, it would be more formidable
and dangerous than a naval and military power of the enemy.1
Jackson saved the greatest passion of his argument for the end. Speaking
now, not to Congress, but to the voters at large, he said:
It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of
government to their selfish purposes. Distinctions in society will always
exist under every just government.
Equality of talents, of education, or of
wealth cannot be produced by human institutions. In the full enjoyment of
the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior industry, economy, and
virtue, every man is equally entitled to protection by law; but when the
laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial
distinctions, to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive privileges, to make
the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of society
- the farmers, mechanics, and laborers - who have neither the time nor the
means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to complain of the
injustice of their Government.
There are no necessary evils in government.
Its evils exist only in its abuses. If it would confine itself to equal
protection, and, as Heaven does its rains, shower its favor alike on the
high and the low, the rich and the poor, it would be an unqualified
blessing.
In the act before me there seems to be a wide and unnecessary
departure from these just principles.2
1. Krooss, pp. 26-27.
2. Ibid., pp. 36-37.
The veto did not defeat the Bank. It was merely a declaration of war.
The
major battles were yet to come.
BIDDLE'S CONTROL OVER CONGRESS
As Commanding General of the pro-bank forces, Biddle had one powerful
advantage over his adversary.
For all practical purposes, Congress was in
his pocket. Or, more accurately, the product of his generosity was in the
pockets of Congressmen. Following the Rothschild Formula, Biddle had been
careful to reward compliant politicians with success in the business world.
Few of them were willing to bite the hand that fed them.
Even the great
Senator, Daniel Webster, found himself kneeling at Biddle's throne.
Galbraith says:
Biddle was not without resources. In keeping with his belief that banking
was the ultimate source of power, he had regularly advanced funds to members
of Congress when delay on appropriations bills had held up their pay.
Daniel
Webster was, at various times, a director of the Bank and on retainer as its
counsel.
"I believe my retainer has not been renewed or refreshed as usual.
If it be wished that my relation to the Bank should be continued, it may be
well to send me the usual retainers."
Numerous other men of distinction had
been accommodated, including members of the press.1
Webster is a particularly interesting study in how even so-called "great"
men can be compromised by an addiction to wealth.
He had always been an
advocate of sound money in Congress, yet, as a lawyer on Biddle's payroll,
he represented the Bank's position before the Supreme Court in McCulloch v.
Maryland. Much of the twisted logic that allowed the Court to end-run the
Constitution and destroy sound money came from his pen.
After Jackson's veto of the Bank's charter, Biddle requested Webster to
deliver speeches specifically for the purpose of having the Bank reprint
them for mass distribution.
In one of those speeches, Webster echoed the old
refrain that the Bank served as a moderating influence on the nation's other
banks and then piously proclaimed:
"Congress can alone coin money;... no
State (nor even Congress itself) can make anything a tender but gold and
silver, in the payment of debts."2
1- Galbraith, p. 80.
2- Krooss, p. 2.
In an act of astounding hypocrisy, this
speech was distributed widely by the very institution that was
designed specifically for creating fractional fiat money, without gold or
silver backing, to function as tender in the payment of debts.
Then, as now,
most people did not discern between words and actions and believed that this
speech, delivered by such a "great" man, was evidence of the Bank's
worthiness. Biddle even distributed 300,000 copies of Jackson's veto
message, apparently in the belief that many would not read it Obviously^ if
the Bank thought it was so bad as to distribute it, it must be bad.1
The power of the Bank's money was everywhere. It was as John Randolph, the
fiery Old Republican from Virginia, had said:
"Every man you meet in this
House or out of it, with some rare exceptions, which only serve to prove the
rule, is either a stockholder, president, cashier, clerk or doorkeeper,
runner, engraver, paper-maker, or mechanic in some other way to a bank."2
JACKSON APPEALS DIRECTLY TO THE VOTERS
Congress, the banks, speculators, industrialists, and segments of the press;
these were the forces commanded by Biddle.
But Jackson had a secret weapon
which had never been used before in American politics. That weapon was a
direct appeal to the electorate. He took his message on the campaign trail
and delivered it in words well chosen to make a lasting impression on the
voter. He spoke out against a moneyed aristocracy which had invaded the
halls of Congress, impaired the morals of the people, threatened their
liberty, and subverted the electoral process.
The Bank, he said, was a
hydra-headed monster eating the flesh of the common man. He swore to do
battle with the monster and slay it or be slain by it. He bellowed his
position to every crowd he could reach: Bank and no Jackson, or no bank and
Jackson.3

On the subject of paper money, the President was equally emphatic.
His
biographer describes the campaign:
On his homeward journey he reportedly paid all his expenses in gold. "No
more paper money, you see, fellow citizens," he remarked with each gold
payment, "if I can only put down this Nicholas Biddle and his monster bank."
Gold, hardly the popular medium of exchange, was held up to the people as
the safe and sound currency which Jackson and his administration hoped to
restore to regular use. Unlike paper money, gold represented real value and
true worth. It was the coin of honest men.
Rag money, on the other hand, was
the instrument of banks and swindlers to corrupt and cheat an innocent and
virtuous public.1
Jackson had awakened the indignation of the American people.
When the
November ballots were cast, he received a mammoth vote of confidence. He
received fifty-five per cent of the popular vote (with thirty-seven per cent
for Clay, eight per cent for Wirt) and eighty per cent of the vote in the
electoral college. But the war still was not over. Jackson won the election,
but the Bank had four more years to operate, and it intended to use those
years to sway public sentiment back to its support.
The biggest battles were
yet to come.
JACKSON REMOVES FEDERAL DEPOSITS
Jackson did not wait to act. He knew that time would be used as a weapon
against him.
"The hydra of corruption is only scotched, not dead" he said.2
1. Remini, Life, pp. 234-35.
2. Remini, Course, p. 52.
Soon after the election, he ordered Secretary of the Treasury, William
Duane, to place all new deposits of the federal government into various
state banks around the country and to pay current expenses out of the funds
still held by the Bank of the United States until that account was drained
to zero.
Without the use of federal money, surely the monster would perish.
To Jackson's chagrin, however, Duane balked at the order out of a sincere
conviction that, to do so, would be disruptive to the economy.
This was not the first time a Cabinet officer and a President had come to
disagreement. In the past, however, the impasse had always been resolved by
the resignation of the Secretary. This time was different. Duane refused to
resign, and that raised an interest-ling constitutional question.
A
President could appoint a member of the executive branch only with the
consent of the Senate. The Constitution was silent, however, on the matter
of dismissal. Did plat, too, require Senate approval? The implication was
that it did, but the issue had never been tested.
Jackson had no patience for such theoretical questions. The letter arrived
promptly on Duane's desk:
"Your further services as
Secretary of the Treasury are no longer required." 1
On October 1, 1833,
federal deposits began to move out of the Bank.
Jackson felt that he finally had the monster firmly within his grasp.
"I
have it chained," he said.2
With gleeful confidence, he added:
"I am ready
with the screws to draw every tooth and then the stumps." If I am not
mistaken, he went on, we will have "Mr. Biddle and his Bank as quiet and
harmless as a lamb in six weeks."3
BIDDLE DELIBERATELY CREATES MONETARY CHAOS
The President's view of the Bank's meek captivity was premature, to say the
least.
Biddle responded, not like a lamb, but more like a wounded lion. His
plan was to rapidly contract the nation's money supply and create another
panic-depression similar to the one the Bank had created thirteen years
earlier. This then could be blamed on Jackson's withdrawal of federal
deposits, and the resulting backlash surely would cause Congress to override
the President's veto.
Remini tells us:
Biddle counterattacked. He initiated a general curtailment of loans
throughout the entire banking system... It marked the beginning of a
bone-crushing struggle between a powerful financier and a determined and
equally powerful politician. Biddle understood what he was about. He knew
that if he brought enough pressure and agony to the money market, only then
could he force the President to restore the deposits. He almost gloated.
"This worthy President thinks that because he has scalped Indians and
imprisoned Judges, he is to have his way with the Bank. He is mistaken."4
"The ties of party allegiance can only be broken," he declared, "by the
actual conviction of existing distress in the community."
And such distress,
of course, would eventually put everything to rights.
"Nothing but
widespread suffering will produce any effect on Congress... Our only safety
is in pursuing a steady course of firm restriction - and I have no doubt
that such a course will ultimately lead to restoration of the currency and
the recharter of the Bank.5... My
own course is decided. All other banks and all the merchants may I break,
but the Bank of the United States shall not break."6

Biddle, therefore, decided to use the American people as
sacrificial pawns
in the giant chess match for the Bank's survival.
The resulting economic
chaos is not difficult to imagine. Biddle's contraction of the money
supply was executed at a particularly [vulnerable moment. Business had been
expanding as a result of the Bank's prior easy credit and now was dependent
on it. Also, the tariff came due at precisely this time, placing still more
demand for cash and credit.
Losses were sustained everywhere, wages and i
prices sagged, men were put out of work, companies went bankrupt. By the
time Congress reconvened in December, in what was called the "Panic
Session," the nation was in an uproar. Newspapers editorialized with alarm,
and letters of angry protest flooded into Washington.
As the pressure continued to build in Congress, it began to look as though
Biddle's plan would work. In the public eye, it was Jackson who was solely
responsible for the nation's woes.
It was his t arrogant removal of
Secretary Duane; it was his foolish insistence for removing the deposits; it
was his obstinate opposition to Congress.
JACKSON IS CENSURED BY THE SENATE
For one-hundred days, a "phalanx of orators" daily excoriated the President
for his arrogant and harmful conduct.
At length, a resolution of censure was
introduced into the Senate and, on March 28,1834, it was passed by a vote
of 26 to 20. This was the first time that a President had ever been censured
by Congress, and it was a savage blow to Jackson's pride. Biddle, at last,
had the upper hand.
The President rumbled around the White House in a fit of rage.
"You are a
den of vipers," he said to a delegation of the Bank's supporters. "I intend
to rout you out and by the Eternal God I will rout you out."1
2. Quoted by Viola, p. 86.
The censure was by no means indicative of popular sentiment. Even in the
Senate, which was a hotbed of pro-Bank support, a swing of only three votes
would have defeated the measure.
During all this time, imperceptibly at first, but quickly growing, the
public had been learning the truth. Jackson, of course, was doing everything
within his power to hasten the process, but other factors also were at work,
not the least of which was Biddle himself. So large was his ego that he
could not keep from boasting in public about his plan to deliberately
disrupt the economy.
People heard these boasts and they believed him. The
turning point came when Governor George Wolf of Pennsylvania, the Bank's
home state, came out publicly with a strong denunciation of both the Bank
and Biddle. This was like the starting bell at a horse race. With the Bank's
home state turned against it, there was no one left to defend it and,
literally within days, the mood of the country and of Congress changed.
The Democrats wasted no time consolidating these unexpected gains. To test
their strength on the issue, on April 4, 1834, they called for a vote in the
House on a series of resolutions which were aimed at nullifying the censure
in the Senate. In essence, the resolutions stated that the House totally
approved the President's bank policy.
The first resolution, passed by a vote
of 134 to 82, declared that the Bank of the United States "ought not to be rechartered."
The second, passed by a vote of 118 to 103, agreed that the
deposits "ought not to be restored." And the third, passed by an
overwhelming vote of 175 to 42, called for the establishment of a special
committee of Congress to investigate whether the Bank had deliberately
instigated the current economic crisis.
It was an overwhelming victory for
Jackson which would be culminated a few years later with the passage of a
resolution in the Senate which formally rescinded the previous vote of
censure.
BIDDLE DEFIES CONGRESS
When the investigating committee arrived at the Bank's doors in Philadelphia
armed with a subpoena to examine the books, Biddle flatly refused.
Nor would
he allow inspection of correspondence with Congressmen relating to their
personal loans and advances. And he steadfastly refused to testify before
the committee back in Washington. For lesser mortals, such action would have
resulted in citations of contempt of Congress and would have carried stiff
fines or imprisonment.
But not for Nicholas Biddle.
Remini explains:
The committeemen demanded a citation for contempt, but many southern
Democrats opposed this extreme action, and refused to cooperate. As Biddle
bemusedly observed, it would be ironic if he went to prison "by the votes of
members of Congress because I would not give up to their enemies their
confidential letters."
Although Biddle escaped a contempt citation, his
outrageous defiance of the House only condemned him still further in the
eyes of the American public.1
The Bank was still alive but had been mortally wounded.
By this time,
Jackson had completely paid off the national debt incurred by the War of
1812 and had even run up a surplus. In fact, he ordered the Treasury to give
back to the states more than $35 million, which was used for the
construction of a wide variety of public works.
With these accomplishments close on the heels of his victory over the Bank,
the President had earned the undying hatred of monetary scientists, both in
America and abroad. It is not surprising, therefore, that on January 30,
1835, an assassination attempt was made against him. Miraculously, both
pistols of the assailant misfired, and Jackson was spared by a quirk of
fate. It was the first such attempt to be made against the life of a
President of the United States.
The would-be assassin was Richard Lawrence
who either was truly insane or who pretended to be insane to escape harsh
punishment. At any rate, Lawrence was found not guilty due to insanity.2
Later, he boasted to friends that he had been in touch
with powerful
people in Europe who had promised to protect him from punishment should he
be caught.3

2. Remini, Democracy, p. 228-29.
3. Robert J. Donovan, The Assassins (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1952), p.
83.
The ending to this saga holds no surprises.
The Bank's charter expired in
1836 and it was restructured as a state bank by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. After a spree of speculation in cotton, lavish advances to the
Bank's officers, and the suspension of payment in specie, Biddle was
arrested and charged with fraud. Although not convicted, he was still
undergoing civil litigation when he died.
Within five years, the
establishment was forced to close its doors forever, and America's third
experience with central tanking came to a close.
SOME BAD MIXED IN WITH THE GOOD
It is tempting to let the story stop right there and allow Jackson to
forever wear the crown of hero and dragon slayer.
But a more balanced view
of these events leads to the conclusion that the forces of virtue were not
without contamination. Jackson represented the position of those who wanted
only gold and silver for the nation's money. But this group was not large
enough to match the power of the Bank. He was joined in that battle by many
groups which hated the Bank for other, less admirable reasons.
State banks
and business interests along the expanding frontier, for example, were not
the least interested in Constitutional money. They wanted just the opposite.
They viewed the modest restraints of the federal Bank as excessive.
With the
federal Bank out of the way, they anticipated no restraints at all. As we
shall see in the following section, it is ironic that this is the group that
got what it wanted, not the hard-money Jacksonians.
One cannot blame Jackson for accepting the support of these groups in his
effort to slay the dragon. In politics, it often is necessary to make
temporary alliances with one's opponents to achieve occasional common
objectives. But Jackson went further than that. More than any other
President before him, and rivaled by only a few since, he changed the
character of American politics.
He led the nation away from the new concept
of diffused powers, carefully worked out by the founding fathers, back
toward the Old-World tradition of concentration and monarchy. By strongly
challenging the right of the States to secede from the Union, he set into
motion a concept that, not only would lead to civil war, but which would put
an end forever to the ability of the states to check the expanding power of
the federal government.
No longer was the Union to be based on the principle
of consent of the governed. It was now to be based on force of arms. And
through the manipulation of voter passion on the Bank issue, he changed the
perception of the role of President from public servant to national leader.
At the height of the battle against the Bank, when Jackson was making a
direct appeal to the voters for support, he declared:
"The President is the
direct representative of the people."
To fully comprehend the significance
of that statement, it must be remembered that the plan of the Constitution
was for the President to be elected indirectly by the state legislatures,
not by the voters at large.
After fighting a war to throw off the rule of King George, in, the founding
fathers wanted nothing more to do with kings of any land, and they went out
of their way to make sure that the President of the United States would
never be looked upon as such. They realized that an elected ruler, unless
his power is carefully limited and diffused, can become just as despotic as
an unelected one.
Article 2, Section 1, of the Constitution, therefore,
established an electoral college to select the President.
Members of the college are to be appointed by the states. Congressmen,
Senators, or other officers of the federal government are specifically and
wisely excluded. The college is supposed to select a President strictly on
the basis of his integrity and executive Ability, not his party label,
political connections, good looks, charisma, or stirring orations.
The
people may elect their Congressmen, but the electoral college chooses the
President. Thus, it was intended that the President would have a different
constituency from Congress, and this difference was important to insure the
balance of power that the framers of the Constitution worked so hard to
create. As a means of keeping government under control, it was a truly
brilliant piece of political engineering.
All of that was changed in the election of 1832.
One of the sad facts of
history is that good causes often are the occasion for establishing bad
precedents. Jackson's fight against the Bank of the United States was one of
those events.
SUMMARY
The government had encouraged widespread banking fraud during the War of
1812 as an expedient for paying its bills, and this had left the nation in
monetary chaos.
At the end of the war, instead of allowing the fraudulent
banks to fall and letting the free market heal the damage, Congress decided
to protect the banks, to organize the fraud, and to perpetuate the losses.
It did this by creating the nation's third central bank called the Second
Bank of the United States.
The new bank was almost an exact carbon copy of the previous one. It was
authorized to create money for the federal government land to regulate state
banks. It influenced larger amounts of capital and was better organized
across state lines than the old bank. Consequently its policies had a
greater impact on the creation and extinguishing of the nation's money
supply.
For the first time in
our history, the effects began to ricochet across the entire country at once
instead of being confined to geographical regions. The age of the boom-bust
cycle had at last arrived in America.
In 1820, public opinion began to swing back in favor of the sound-money
principles espoused by the Jeffersonian Republicans. But since the
Republican Party had by then abandoned those principles, a new coalition was
formed, headed by Martin Van Buren and Andrew Jackson, called the Democrat
Party. One of its primary platforms was the abolishment of the Bank. After
Jackson was elected in 1828, he began in full earnest to bring that about.
The head of the Bank was a formidable adversary by the name of Nicholas
Biddle. Biddle, not only possessed great personal abilities, but many
members of Congress were indebted to him for business favors. Consequently,
the Bank had many political friends.
As Jackson's first term of office neared its end, Biddle asked Congress for
an early renewal of the Bank's charter, hoping that Jackson would not risk
controversy in a reelection year. The bill was easily passed, but Jackson
accepted the challenge and vetoed the measure. Thus, a battle over the
Bank's future became the primary presidential campaign issue.
Jackson was reelected by a large margin, and one of his first acts was to
remove federal deposits from the Bank and place them into private, regional
banks. Biddle counterattacked by contracting credit and calling in loans.
This was calculated to shrink the money supply and trigger a national
panic-depression, which it did. He publicly blamed the downturn on Jackson's
removal of deposits.
The plan almost worked. Biddle's political allies succeeded in having
Jackson officially censured in the Senate. However, when the truth about
Biddle's strategy finally leaked out, it backfired against him.
He was
called before a special Congressional investigative committee to explain his
actions, the censure against Jackson was rescinded, and the nation's third
central bank passed into oblivion.
Chapter Eighteen
LOAVES AND FISHES AND CIVIL WAR
Attempts to stabilize the banking system by political measures, including
regulation of fractional-reserve ratios and establishing bank-failure
insurance funds; the failure of all such schemes; the resulting economic
conditions that led up to the Civil War.
As detailed in the previous chapter, by 1836 the hydra-headed monster had
been slain and, true to the President's campaign promise, the nation had
Jackson and no Bank.
In April of that year, the Administration moved to consolidate bits victory
and pushed a series of monetary reforms through Congress. One of these
required all banks to cease issuing paper notes under five dollars. The
figure later was increased to twenty dollars, and its purpose was to compel
the nation to return to the use of gold and silver coin for everyday use,
leaving bank notes primarily for large commercial transactions.
The White
House also announced that, in the future, all federal land sales would
require full payment in "lawful money," which, of course, meant
precious-metal coins.1
It must be remembered, however, that even though the Bank of the United
States was dead, banking was very much alive, and so were Jackson's enemies.
Much to the disappointment of the hard-money advocates, these measures were
not sufficient to usher in the millennium.
Not only were they inadequate by
themselves, they were soon circumvented by the development of new banking
techniques and eventually were dismantled completely by a fickle Congress.

Fool Quartet (Columbia, South Carolina: Foundation for American Education,

The prohibition against bank notes of small denomination deserves special
notice. It was an excellent concept, but what the legislators failed to
understand, or at least pretended not to understand, was that banks at this
time were increasingly dealing with checkbook money, technically called
demand deposits.
As people gradually became accustomed to this new method of
transferring funds, the importance of bank notes declined. Placing a limit
on the issuance of bank notes without any restriction on the creation of
demand deposits was an exercise in futility.
In 1837, as the Bank of the United States slipped into history, the nation
was at the tail end of an economic boom. Professor Rothbard tells us that
this expansion and the accompanying inflation had been "fueled by the
central bank."1
1. Rothbard,Mystery, p. HI.
Total money in circulation had risen by eighty-four per cent
in just four years.
Then, as inevitable as the setting sun, that portion of
the money supply which had been created by fractional-reserve banking - in
other words, the part which was backed by nothing - began to contract.
Sixteen per cent of all the nation's money totally disappeared in just that
first year. Again, men were put out of work, businesses went into
bankruptcy, homes and savings were lost. Many banks folded also, but their
operators walked away with the spoils.
Only the depositors were left holding
the empty bag.
There were numerous proposals advanced regarding how to infuse stability
into the banking system. But, then as now, none of them dealt with the real
problem, which was fractional-reserve banking itself.
As Groseclose
observed, these proposals were,
"each according to a particular theory of how
to multiply loaves and fishes, or how to make candy wool."
Since the
proposals presented then are identical to the ones being offered today, and
since each of them was actually tried, it would seem appropriate to inquire
into the actual results of these experiments.
PROPOSAL TO BASE MONEY ON BANK ASSETS
There were four schools of thought regarding the multiplication of loaves
and fishes.
The first of these was that the creation of money should be
limited to a ratio of the bank's assets. This was the formula that was tried
in the New England states. In Massachusetts, for example, the issuance of
bank notes was limited to two times the amount of the bank's capital
actually held in the vault.
Furthermore, this could not be in the form of
paper money, bonds, securities, or other debt instruments; it had to be
strictly gold or silver coin. Also, the banks were limited in the number of
small-denomination bank notes they could issue and, in this, Massachusetts
served as the model for Jackson's attempted reform at the federal level.
By
previous standards, and certainly by the standards that prevail today, this
was an exceptionally conservative policy. In fact, even during the previous
stress of the War of 1812, when banks were failing by the hundreds across
the country, the Massachusetts banks, and most of the other New England
banks as well, were able to maintain full payment in specie.
With the passage of time, however, the limit on bank notes became less
important, because the banks now were using checkbook money instead. Their
paper notes may have been limited to two-hundred per cent of their capital,
but there was no effective limit to the numbers they could ink into people's
deposit books. So the "fraction" in fractional-reserve banking began to
shrink again.
Consequently, the monetary contraction of 1837
"was like a scythe over the crop," says Grosedose, and thirty-two Massachusetts
banks collapsed between that year and 1844.1
The state attempted to patch the system by instituting a network of bank
examiners and by increasing the liability of bank Stockholders for the lost
funds of their depositors, but the underlying problem was still ignored. A
new crop of banks then sprang into existence and a new wave of speculative
mania swept through the economy.
By 1862, even though the law still limited
bank notes lo two times capital, the banks had created $73,685,000 in total
money, including checkbook money. This was supported by a base of only
$9,595,000 of specie, a reserve of only thirteen per cent.
Massachusetts had
not solved the problem.
PROPOSAL TO PROTECT DEPOSITS WITH A SAFETY FUND
The second theory about how to have stable banking and allow the banks to
create money out of nothing was to create a "safety land."
This fund,
supported by all the banks, would come to the aid of any member which needed
an emergency loan to cover a sudden drain of its reserves. It was the
forerunner of today's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and related
agencies.
The first safety fund was established in New York in 1829. The law required
each bank to contribute annually one-half of one per cent of its capital
stock until the total reached three per cent. The fund was first put to the
test during the crisis of 1837, and was almost swamped.
The only thing that
saved it was that the state agreed to accept the worthless notes of all the
defunct banks as payment for canal tolls. In other words, the taxpayers were
compelled to make up the difference. When the fund was exhausted, the
solvent banks were punished by being forced to pay for the deficits of the
insolvent ones. Naturally, this impelled all banks to act more recklessly.
Why not? The up side was that profits would be higher - for a time, at least
- and the down side was that, if recklessness got them into trouble, the
safety fund would bail them out.
The result was that the system provided a
penalty for prudence and an incentive for recklessness; a situation with
perfect parallel to that which exists in the banking system today.
Groseclose
says:
The conservatively managed institutions, lending upon the safer risks, upon
which naturally the margins of profit were smaller, found the assessments
burdensome, and were compelled to embark upon the more speculative business
in order to carry the charges.
Gradually, all banks sank into the quagmire and, in 1857, the Massachusetts
safety-fund was abandoned.
Michigan's experience with a safety fund was perhaps more typical of the
period. It was established in 1836 and was completely blown away the next
year, during the panic of 1837.1
1. Groseclose, Money and Man, p. 186.
PROPOSAL TO BASE MONEY ON SECURITIES
The third proposal for maintaining a stable monetary system while, at the
same time, allowing the banks to operate fraudulently was to base the money
supply on government securities; in other words, upon paper certificates of
government debt.
This was the scheme adopted in the 1850s by Illinois,
Indiana, Wisconsin and other Midwestern states. It also set the precedent
for the Federal Reserve System sixty years later.
Groseclose continues:
So rampant was the note-issue mania that the notes came to be called by the
appropriate name of "red dog" and "wild cat" currency...
The rising crop of
banks created a fictitious demand and a rising market for securities (to be
used as capital stock) and a consequent stimulus to the creation of public
debt by the issue of securities.
This was followed by more bank notes being
issued against the securities, demand increasing and the market rising, more
Securities issues, more bank notes, and so on in an endless chain of debt
creation and the inflation of paper wealth.
The process was finally brought
to a stop by the panic of 1857.
PROPOSAL TO BACK MONEY WITH STATE CREDIT
The fourth proposal for producing something out of nothing was to back the
issuance of money by the full faith and credit of the state. This was the
method tried by many of the Southern states and lit, too, has survived to
become one of the cornerstones of our modern-day banking system.
Alabama, for example, in 1835 created a state bank funded by a public bond
issue of $13,800,000. Instant money flooded through [the economy and people
were joyous over the miracle prosperity. The legislators were so intoxicated
with the scheme that they completely abolished direct taxation and decided
to run the government on bank money instead.
In other words, instead of
raising state revenue through taxes, they found it easier to raise it
through inflation.
Like all the others, this bubble also burst in the panic of 1837. A
postmortem examination of the Bank showed that $6,000,000 of its assets were
completely worthless. The people who had loaned their real money to the
venture, backed by the full faith and credit of the [state, lost almost all
of their investment - in addition to what they had paid through inflation.
Mississippi put its full faith and credit behind a state bank in 1838 and
issued $15,000,000 in bonds as backing for its bank notes.
The bank was
belly-up within four years, and the state completely Repudiated its
obligations on the bonds. This infuriated the bond polders, particularly the
British financiers who had purchased a large portion of the issue.
The
devastating effect upon the state and its people is described by Henry Poor:
The $48,000,000 of the bank's loans were never paid; the $23,000,000 of
notes and deposits were never redeemed. The whole system fell, a huge and
shapeless wreck, leaving the people of the State very much as they came into
the world...
Everybody was in debt, without any possible means of payment.
Lands became worthless, for the reason that no one had any money to pay for
them... Such numbers of people fled ... from the State that the common
return upon legal processes against debtors was in the very abbreviated form
"G.T.T." - gone to Texas.
Money, based on the full faith and credit of the state, met similar fates in
Illinois, Kentucky, Florida, Tennessee, and Louisiana. When the state bank
collapsed in Illinois in 1825, all of the "full-faith" bank notes left in
its possession were ceremoniously burned at the public square. Another bank
was formed in 1835 and collapsed in 1842.
So devastating were these
experiences that the Illinois Constitution of 1848 stipulated that,
henceforth, the state should never again create a bank or own banking stock.
In Arkansas, even real estate was tried as a magic wand. Subscribers to the
state bank, instead of putting up cash, were allowed merely to pledge their
real estate holdings as collateral. The bank notes rapidly plummeted in
value to only twenty-five per cent of their face amount, and within four
years, the bank was gone.
THE MIRAGE OF FREE BANKING
There was a parallel development at this time called "free banking."
The
name is an insult to truth. What was called free banking was merely the
conversion of banks from corporations to private associations. Aside from no
longer receiving a charter from the state, practically every other aspect of
the system remained the same, including a multitude of government controls,
regulations, supports, and other blocks against the free market.
George Selgin reminds us that,
"permission to set up a bank was usually accompanied
by numerous restrictions, including especially required loans to the state."
The free banks were no less fraudulent than the chartered banks. The old
custom was revived of rushing gold coins from one bank to another just ahead
of the bank examiners, and of "putting a ballast of lead, broken glass and
(appropriately) ten-penny nails in the box under a thinner covering of gold
coins." When one such free bank collapsed in Massachusetts, it was
discovered that its bank note circulation of $500,000 was backed by exactly
$86.48.
Professor Hans Sennholz writes:
Although economists disagree on many things, most see eye to eye on their
acceptance of political control... These economists invariably point at
American money and banking before the Civil War which, in their judgment,
confirms their belief.
In particular, they cite the "Free Banking Era" of
1838-1860 as a frightening example of turbulent banking and, therefore,
applaud the legislation that strengthened the role of government.
In reality, the instability experienced during the Free Banking Era was not
caused by anything inherent in banking, but resulted from extensive
political intervention... "Free banking" acts... did not repeal burdensome
statutory provisions and regulatory directives.
In fact they added a few.
For banking to have been truly free, the states would have had to do only
two things:
(1) enforce banking contracts the same as any other contract,
and then
(2) step out of the picture.
By enforcing banking contracts, the
executives of any bank which failed to redeem its currency in specie would
have been sent to prison, an eventuality which soon would have put a halt to
currency over-issue.
By stepping out of the picture and dropping the pretense
of protecting the public with a barrage of rules, regulations, safety funds,
and guarantees, people would have realized that it was their responsibility
to be cautious and informed. But, instead, the banks continued to enjoy the
special privilege of suspending payment without punishment, and the
politicians clamored to convince the voters that they were taking care of
everything.
In short, throughout this entire period of bank failures, economic chaos,
and fleecing of both investors and taxpayers, America tried everything except
full redemption by gold and silver. As the name of Andrew Jackson faded into
history, so did the dream of honest banking.
Not all banks were corrupt, and certainly not all bankers were conspirators
against the public. There were many examples of honest men striving to act
in an ethical manner in the discharge of their fiduciary responsibilities.
But they were severely hampered by the system within which they labored, a
system which, as previously illustrated, punished prudence and rewarded
recklessness.
In balance, the prudent banker was pushed aside by the
mainstream and became but a footnote to the history of that period.
INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION IN SPITE OF DISHONEST BANKING
Another positive aspect to the picture is that it was during this same time
that many business enterprises came into being and greatly prospered, albeit
at the expense of those who had no desire to contribute.
The great canals
were dug, the railroads pushed back the frontier, boom towns sprang up along
the way, prairies were turned into agricultural land, and new businesses
followed in their wake. Much of this expansion was facilitated by a flood of
fraudulent money created by the banks. Apologists for fractional-reserve
banking have been prone to look at this development and conclude that, in
net balance, it was a good thing.
The fact that some people were cheated in
order for others to prosper did not seem to be important. America just
wouldn't have grown and prospered without funny money.
Galbraith, for
example, exudes:
As civilization, or some approximation, came to an Indiana or Michigan
crossroads in the 1830s or 1840s, so did a bank. Its notes, when used and
loaned to a farmer to buy land, livestock, feed, seed, food or simple
equipment, put him into business.
If he and others prospered and paid off
their loans, the bank survived. If he and others did not so prosper and pay,
the bank failed, and someone - perhaps a local creditor, perhaps an eastern
supplier - was left holding the worthless notes.
But some borrowers from
this bank were by now in business. Somewhere, someone holding the notes had
made an involuntary contribution to the winning of the West... The
[banking] anarchy served the frontier far better than a more orderly system
that kept a tight hand on credit could have done.1
1. Galbraith, p. 85.
William Greider continues this rationale:
"Reckless, booming anarchy," in short, produced fundamental progress. It was
not a stable system, racked as it was with bank failures and collapsed
business ventures, outrageous speculation and defaulted loans. Yet it was
also energetic and inventive, creating permanent economic growth that
endured after the froth had blown away.
This, of course, is a classic example of the failure of liberal economics.
When evaluating a policy, it focuses only on one beneficial consequence for
one group of people and ignores the multitude of harmful effects which
befall all other groups. Yes, if we look only at the frontiersmen who
acquired new ranches and established new business, the fractional-reserve
system looks pretty good.
But, if we add in to the equation all the
financial losses to all of the people who were victimized by the system -
what Galbraith calls "an involuntary contribution" and what Greider lightly
dismisses as "froth" - then the product is zero at best and, in terms of
morality, is deeply in the negative.
Galbraith, Greider, and other popular economists assume that the West could
not possibly have been won with honest banking. Logic does not support such
a conclusion. There is every reason to believe that the bank failures and
the resulting business failures on the frontier all but canceled out the
gains that were made by hard work and honest industry.
Had these destructive
convulsions been absent, as most of them would have been under a less
chaotic system, there likely would have been fewer business starts, but a
greater number would have finished, and it is entirely possible that the
West would have been won even faster than it was.
It's too bad the theory has never been tried.
THE UNION IN JEOPARDY
As chronicled in a previous section, economic conflict has always played a
major role in fomenting war.
There is no time in American history in which
there was more economic conflict between segments of the population than
there was prior to the Civil War. It is not surprising, therefore, that this
period led directly into the nation's bloodiest war, made all the more
tragic because it pitted brother against brother.
There are many popular myths about the cause of the War Between the States.
Just as the Bolshevik Revolution is commonly believed to have been a
spontaneous mass uprising against a tyrannical aristocracy, so, too, it is
generally accepted that the Civil War was fought over the issue of slavery.
That, at best, is a half-truth.
Slavery was an issue, but the primary force
for war was a clash between the economic interests of the North and the
South. Even the issue of slavery itself was based on economics. It may have
been a moral issue in the North where prosperity was derived from the
machines of heavy industry, but in the agrarian South, where fields had to
be tended by vast work forces of human labor, the issue was primarily a
matter of economics.
The relative unimportance of slavery as a cause for war was made clear by
Lincoln himself during his campaign for the Presidency in 1860, and he
repeated that message in his first inaugural address:
Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by
the accession of a Republican administration their property and their peace
and personal security are to be endangered...
I have no purpose, directly
or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states
where it now exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have
no inclination to do so.
Even after the outbreak of war in 1861, Lincoln confirmed his previous
stand.
He declared:
My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and it is not
either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing
any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves,
I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving others
alone, I would also do that.
It may come as a surprise to learn that, by strict definition, Abraham
Lincoln was a white supremacist.
In his fourth debate with Senator Stephen
Douglas, he addressed the subject bluntly:
I am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social
and political equality of the white and black races - that I am
not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor
of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and
I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between
the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races
living together on terms of social and political equality.
And inasmuch as
they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the
position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in
favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.1
This is not to say that Lincoln was indifferent to the institution of
slavery, for he felt strongly that it was a violation of personal and
national morality, but he also knew that slavery was gradually being swept
away all over the world - with the possible exception of Africa itself - and
he believed that it would soon disappear in America simply by allowing the
natural forces of enlightenment to work their way through the political
system.
He feared - and rightly so - that to demand immediate and total
reform, not only would destroy the Union, it would lead to massive bloodshed
and more human suffering than was endured even under slavery itself.
He
said:
I have not allowed myself to forget that the abolition of the Slave trade by
Great Britain was agitated a hundred years before it was a final success;
that the measure had its open fire-eating opponents; its stealthy
"don't-care" opponents; its dollar-and-cent opponents; its inferior-race
opponents; its Negro-equality opponents; and its religion and good-order
opponents; that all these opponents got offices, and their adversaries got
none.
But I have also remembered that though they blazed like tallow-candles
for a century, at last they flickered in the socket, died out, stank in the
dark for a brief season, and were remembered no more, even by the smell.
School boys know that Wilbeforce and Granville Sharpe helped that cause
forward; but who can now name a single man who labored to retard it?
Remembering these things I cannot but regard it as possible that the higher
object of this contest may not be completely attained within the term of my
natural life.2
If Lincoln's primary goal in the War was not the abolition of slavery but
simply to preserve the Union, the question arises:
-
Why did the Union need
preserving?
-
Or, more pointedly, why did the Southern states want to secede?

LEGAL PLUNDER, NOT SLAVERY, THE CAUSE OF WAR
The South, being predominantly an agricultural region, had to import
practically all of its manufactured goods from the Northern states or from
Europe, both of which reciprocated by providing a market for the South's
cotton.
However, many of the textiles and manufactured items were
considerably cheaper from Europe, even after the cost of shipping had been
added. The Southern states, therefore, often found it to their advantage to
purchase these European goods rather than those made in the North.
This put
considerable competitive pressure on the American manufacturers to lower
their prices and operate more efficiently.
The Republicans were not satisfied with that arrangement. They decided to
use the power of the federal government to tip the scales of competition in
their favor. Claiming that this was in the "national interest," they levied
stiff import duties on almost every item corning from Europe that was also
manufactured in the North.
Not surprisingly, there was no duty applied to
cotton which, presumably, was not a commodity in the national interest.
One
result was that European countries countered by stopping the purchase of
U.S. cotton, which badly hurt the Southern economy. The other result was
that manufacturers in the North were able to charge higher prices without
fear of competition, and the South was forced to pay more for practically
all of its necessities. It was a classic case of legalized plunder in which
the law was used to enrich one group of citizens at the expense of another.
Pressure from the North against slavery in the South made matters even more
volatile.
A fact often overlooked in this episode is that the cost of a
slave was very high, around $1,500 each. A modest plantation with only forty
or fifty slaves, therefore, had a large capital investment which, in terms
of today's purchasing power, represented many millions of dollars. To the
South, therefore, abolition meant, not only the loss of its ability to
produce a cash crop, but the total destruction of an enormous capital base.
Many Southern plantation owners were working toward the day when they could
convert their investment to more profitable industrial production as had
been done in the North, and others felt that freemen who were paid wages
would be more efficient than slaves who had no incentive to work. For the
present, however, they were stuck with the system they inherited.
They felt
that a complete and sudden abolition of slavery with no transition period
would destroy their economy and leave many of the former slaves to starve -
all of which actually happened in due course.1
1. See "No Civil War at All; Part One/'
by William Mcllhany, Journal of Individualist Studies, Winter, 1992, p. 41.
That was the situation that existed at the time of Lincoln's campaign and
why, in his speeches, he attempted to calm the fears of the South about his
intentions. But his words were mostly political rhetoric, Lincoln was a
Republican, and he was totally dependent on the Northern industrialists who
controlled the Party.
Even if he had wanted to - and there is no indication
that he did - he could not have reversed the trend of economic favoritism
and protectionism that swept him into office.
MEXICO AND THE MONROE DOCTRINE
In addition to the conflicting interests between North and South, there were
other forces also working to split the nation in two.
Those forces were
rooted in Europe and centered around the desire of France, Spain, and
England to control the markets of Latin America. Mexico was the prime
target. This was the reason the Monroe Doctrine had been formulated
thirty-eight years previously.
President James Monroe had put the European
nations on notice that the United States would not interfere in their
affairs, and that any interference by them in American affairs would not be
tolerated. In particular, the proclamation said that the American continents
were no longer to be considered as available for colonization.
None of the European powers wanted to put this issue to the test, but they
knew that if the United States were to become embroiled in a civil war, it
could not also cross swords in Latin America. To encourage war between the
states, therefore, was to pave the way for colonial expansion in Mexico. The
Americas had become a giant chess board for the game of global politics.
In the American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War, we read:
The war had not progressed very far before it was clear that the ruling
classes in each of these two countries [England and France] sympathized
strongly with the Confederacy - so strongly that with just a little prodding
they might be moved to intervene and bring about Southern independence by
force of arms...
Europe's aristocracies had never been happy about the
prodigious success of
the Yankee democracy. If the nation now broke into halves, proving that
democracy did not contain the stuff of survival, the rulers of Europe would
be well pleased.
The global chess match between Lincoln on the one side and England and
France on the other was closely watched by the other leaders of Europe.
One
of the most candid observers at that time was the Chancellor of Germany,
Otto von Bismarck. Since Bismarck was, himself, deeply obligated to the
power of international finance, his observations are doubly revealing.
He
said:
The division of the United States into federations of equal force was
decided long before the Civil War by the high financial powers of Europe.
These bankers were afraid that the United States, if they remained in one
block and as one nation, would attain economic and financial independence,
which would upset their financial domination over the Europe and the world.
Of course, in the "inner circle" of Finance, the voice of the Rothschilds
prevailed. They saw an opportunity for prodigious booty if they could
substitute two feeble democracies, burdened with debt to the financiers...
in place of a vigorous Republic sufficient unto herself. Therefore, they
sent their emissaries into the field to exploit the question of slavery and
to drive a wedge between the two parts of the Union...
The rupture between
the North and the South became inevitable; the masters of European finance
employed all their forces to bring it about and to rum it to their
advantage.
The strategy was simple but effective.
Within months after the first clash
of arms between North and South, France had landed troops in Mexico. By
1864, the Mexicans were subdued, and the French monarch installed Ferdinand
Maximilian as the puppet emperor.
The Confederacy found a natural ally in
Maximilian, and it was anticipated by both groups that, after the successful
execution of the War, they would combine into a new nation - dominated by
the financial power of Rothschild, of course. At the same time, England
moved eleven-thousand troops into Canada, positioned them menacingly along
the Union's northern flank, and placed the British fleet onto war-time alert.1
The European powers were closing in for a checkmate.

SUMMARY
The Second Bank of the United States was dead, but banking was very much
alive. Many of the old problems continued, and few ones arrived. The
issuance of banknotes had been severely limited, but that was largely
offset by the increasing use of checkbook money, which had no limits at all
on its issue.
When the Bank of the U.S. slipped into history, the nation was nearing the
end of the boom phase of a boom/bust cycle. When the inevitable contraction
of the money supply came, politicians began Ito offer proposals on how to
infuse stability into the banking system.
None dealt with the real problem,
which was fractional-reserve banking itself. They concentrated instead on
proposals on how to make it work. All of these proposals were tried and
they failed.
These years are sometimes described as a period of free banking, which is an
insult to truth. All that happened was that banks were converted from
corporations to private associations, a change in form, not substance. They
continued to be burdened by government controls, regulations, supports, and
other blocks against the free market.
The economic chaos and conflict of this period was a major because of the
Civil War. Lincoln made it clear during his public speeches that slavery was
not the issue. The basic problem was the North and the South were dependent
on each other for trade. The industrialized North sold its products to the
South which sold its cotton to the North.
The South also had a similar trade
with Europe, and that was an annoyance to the North. Europe was selling many
products at lower prices, and the North was losing market share. Northern
politicians passed protectionist legislation butting import duties on
industrial products. This all but stopped the importation of European goods
and forced the South to buy from the North at higher prices. Europe
retaliated by curtailing the purchase of American cotton.
That hurt the
South even more. It was a classic case of legalized plunder, and the South
wanted out.
Meanwhile, there were powerful forces in Europe that wanted to see America
embroiled in civil war.
If she could be split into two hostile countries,
there would be less obstacle to European expansion on the North American
continent. France was eager to capture Mexico and graft it onto a new empire
which would include many of the Southern states as well. England, on the
other hand, had military forces poised along the Canadian border ready for
action. Political agitators, funded and organized from Europe, were active
on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line.
The issue of slavery was but a ploy.
America had become the target in a ruthless game of world economics and
politics.
Chapter Nineteen
GREENBACKS AND OTHER CRIMES
The causes of the Civil War shown to be economic and political, not the
issue of freedom vs. slavery; the manner in which both sides used fiat money
to finance the war; the important role played by foreign powers.
In the previous chapter, we saw how the American continent had become a
giant chess board in a game of global politics. The European powers had been
anxious to see the United States become embroiled in a civil war and
eventually break into two smaller and weaker nations.
That would pave the way for their .further
colonization of Latin America without fear of the Americans being able to
enforce the Monroe Doctrine. And so it was that, within a few months after
the outbreak of war between North and South, France
landed troops in Mexico and, by 1864, had installed Maximilian as her puppet
monarch. Negotiations were begun Immediately to bring Mexico into the war on
the side of the Confederacy.
England moved her troops to the Canadian border
in a show of strength. America was facing what appeared to be a checkmate
from the powers in Europe.
RUSSIA ALIGNS WITH THE NORTH
It was a masterful move that possibly could have won the game had not an
unexpected event tipped the scale against it.
Tsar Alexander II - who,
incidentally, had never allowed a central bank to be established in Russia
1
- notified Lincoln that he stood ready to militarily align with the North.
Although the Tsar had recently peed the serfs in his own country, his
primary motivation for coming to the aid of the Union undoubtedly had little
to do with emancipating the slaves in the South.
England and France had been
maneuvering to break up the Russian empire by splitting off Finland,
Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Crimea, and Georgia. Napoleon III, of France,
proposed to Great Britain and Austria that the three nations immediately
declare war on Russia to hasten this dismemberment.
Knowing that war was being considered by his enemies, Tsar Alexander decided
to play a chess game of his own. In September of 1863, he dispatched his
Baltic fleet of war ships to Alexandria, Virginia, and his Asiatic fleet to
San Francisco.
The significance of this move was explained by Russian-born
Carl Wrangell-Rokassowsky:
No treaty was signed between Russia and the United States, but their mutual
interest, and the threat of war to both, unified these two nations at this
critical moment. By dispatching his Baltic Fleet to the North American
harbors, the Tsar changed his position from a defensive to an offensive one.
Paragraph 3 of the instructions given to Admiral Lessovsky by Admiral
Krabbe, at that time Russian Secretary oi the Navy, dated July 14th, 1863,
ordered the Russian Fleet, in case of war, to attack the enemies' commercial
shipping and their colonies so as to cause them the greatest possible
damage. The same instructions were given to Admiral Popov, Commander of the
Russian Asiatic Fleet.
The presence of the Russian Navy helped the Union enforce a devastating
naval blockade against the Southern states which denied them access to
critical supplies from Europe.
It was not that these ships single-handedly
kept the French and English vessels at bay. Actually there is no record of
them even firing upon each other, but that is the point. The fact that
neither France nor England at that time wanted to risk becoming involved in
an open war with the United States and Russia led them to be extremely
cautious with overt military aid to the South.
Throughout the entire
conflict, they found it expedient to remain officially neutral. Without the
inhibiting effect of the presence of the Russian fleet, the course of the
war could have been significantly different.
The beginning of the war did not go well for the North, and in the early
years, the outcome was far from certain.
Not only did the Union army face
repeated defeats on the battlefield, but enthusiasm from the people at home
was badly sagging. As mentioned previously, at the outset this was not a
popular war based on humanitarian principle; it was a war of business
interests. That presented two serious problems for the North. The first was
how to get people to fight, and the second was how to get them to pay.
Both
problems were solved by the simple expediency of violating the Constitution.
THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION
To get people to fight, it was decided to convert the war into an
anti-slavery crusade.
The Emancipation Proclamation was primarily a move on
the part of Lincoln to fan the dying embers of support for the "Rich-man's
war and the poor-man's fight," as it was commonly called in the North.
Furthermore, it was not an amendment to the Constitution nor even an act of
Congress. It was issued, totally without constitutional authority, as the
solitary order of Lincoln himself, acting as Commander-in-Chief of the armed
forces.
Preservation of the Union was not enough to fire men's enthusiasm for war.
Only the higher issue of freedom could do that. To make the cause of freedom
synonymous with the cause of the North, there was no alternative but to
officially declare against slavery.
After having emphasized over and over
again that slavery was not the reason for war, Lincoln later explained why
he changed his course and issued the Proclamation:
Things had gone from bad to worse until I felt we had reached the end of our
rope on the plan we were pursuing; that we had about played our last card,
and must change our tactics or lose the game. I now determined upon the
adoption of the emancipation policy. 1
The rhetoric of the Proclamation was superb, but the concept left a great
deal to be desired.
Bruce Catton, writing in the American Heritage Pictorial
History of the Civil War explains:
Technically, the proclamation was almost absurd. It proclaimed freedom for
all slaves in precisely those areas where the United States could not make
its authority effective, and allowed slavery to continue in slave states
which remained under Federal control... But in the end
it changed the whole character of the war and, more than any other single
thing, doomed the Confederacy to defeat.
1. Quoted by Charles Adams, Fight, Flight, Fraud: The Story of Taxation
(Curacao, The Netherlands: Euro-Dutch Publishers, 1982), p. 229.
The Proclamation had a profound impact on the European powers as well.
As
long as the war had been viewed as an attempt on the part of a government to
put down rebellion, there was nothing sacred about it, and there was no
stigma attached to helping either side. But now that freedom was the
apparent issue, no government in Europe - least of all England and France -
dared to anger its own subjects by taking sides against a country that was
trying to destroy slavery.
After 1862 the chance that Europe would
militarily intervene on behalf of the Confederacy rapidly faded to zero. On
the propaganda front, the South had been maneuvered into a position which
could not be defended in the modern world.
Converting the war into an antislavery crusade was a brilliant move on
Lincoln's part, and it resulted in a surge of voluntary recruits into the
Union army.
But this did not last. Northerners may have disapproved of
slavery in the South but, once the bloodletting began in earnest, their
willingness to die for that conviction began to wane. At the beginning of
the war, enlistments were for only three months and, when that period was
over, many of the soldiers declined to renew.
Lincoln faced the embarrassing
reality that he soon would have no army to carry on the crusade.
RAISING ARMIES ON BOTH SIDES
Historically, men are willing to take up arms to defend their families,
their homes, and their country when threatened by a hostile foe.
But the
only way to get them to fight in a war in which they have no perceived
personal interest is either to pay them large bonuses and bounties or to
force them to do so by conscription. It is not surprising, therefore, that
both methods were employed to keep the Union army in the field.
Furthermore,
although the Constitution specifies that only Congress can declare war and
raise an army, Lincoln did so entirely on his own authority.
The Northern states were given an opportunity to fill a specified quota with
volunteers before conscription began. To meet these quotas and to avoid the
draft, every state, township, and county developed an elaborate bounty
system. By 1864, there were many areas where a man could receive more than
$1,000 - equivalent to over $50,000 today - just for joining the army. A
person of wealth could avoid the draft simply by paying a commutation fee or
by hiring someone else to serve in his place.
In the South, the government was even more bold in its approach to
conscription. Despite its cherished views on states' rights, the Confederacy
immediately gathered into Richmond many of the powers and prerogatives of a
centralized, national government.
In 1862 it passed a conscription law which
placed exclusive control over every male citizen between the ages of
eighteen and thirty-five into the hands of the Confederate President. As in
the North, there were important loopholes. The owner or overseer of twenty
slaves, for example, could not be called into military service.
In all
fairness, it must be noted that many did not take advantage of this
exclusion. In contrast to the North, soldiers perceived that they were
fighting for the defense of their families, homes, and property rather than
for an abstract cause or for a cash bounty.
REBELLION IN THE NORTH
When conscription was initiated by Lincoln in 1863, people in the North were
outraged. In New York's Madison Square, thousands of protesters marched in
torch parades and attended anti-Lincoln rallies.
Historian James Horan
describes the mood:
"When caricatures of the President were lifted above the
speaker's stand, hisses rose to fill the night with the noise of a million
angry bees."
Federal troops eventually had to be called in to put down
anti-draft riots in Ohio and Illinois.
In New York City, when the first names of the draft were published in the papers on July 12, mobs
stormed the
draft offices and set fire to buildings. The riots continued for four days
and were suppressed only when the federal Army of the Potomac was ordered
to fire into the crowds. Over a thousand civilians were killed or wounded.
After the passage of many years, it is easy to forget that Lincoln had an
insurrection on his hands in the North as well as in the South. The shooting
of a thousand civilians by soldiers of their own government is a tragedy of
mammoth proportions and it tells much about the desperate state of the Union
at that time.
To control that insurrection, Lincoln ignored the Constitution
once again by suspending the right of habeas corpus, which made it possible
for the government to imprison its critics without formal charges and
without trial. Thus, under the banner of opposing slavery, American citizens
in the North, not only were killed on the streets of their own cities, they
were put into military combat against their will and thrown into prison
without due process of law.
In other words, free men were enslaved so that
slaves could be made free. Even if the pretended crusade had been genuine,
it was a bad exchange.
How to get people to pay for the war was handled in a similar fashion. If
the Constitution could be pushed aside on the issue of personal rights and
of war itself, it certainly would not stand in the way of mere funding.
It has often been said that truth is the first casualty in war. To which we
should add: money is the second. During the fiscal year ending in 1861,
expenses of the federal government had been $67 million. After the first
year of armed conflict they were $475 million and, by 1865, had risen to one
billion, three-hundred million dollars.
On the income side of the ledger,
taxes covered only about eleven per cent of that figure. By the end of the
war, the deficit had risen to $2.61 billion.
That money had to come from
somewhere.
INCOME TAXES AND WAR BONDS
The nation's first experiment with the income tax was tried at this time;
another violation of the Constitution.
By today's standards it was a small
bite, but it was still an extremely unpopular measure, and Congress knew
that any additional taxes would further fan the flames of rebellion.
Previously, the traditional source of funding in time of war had been the
banks which simply created money under the pretense of loaning it. But that
method had been severely hampered by the demise of the Bank of the United
States.
The state banks were anxious to step into that role; but, by this
time, most of them had already defaulted in their promise to pay in specie
and were in no position to manufacture further money, at least not money
which the public would be willing to accept.
American banks may have been unable to supply adequate Moans, but the
Rothschild consortium in Britain was both able and willing. It was during
this time that the Rothschilds were consolidating their new industrial
holdings in the United States through a heir agent, August Belmont.
Derek
Wilson tells us:
"They owned or had major shareholdings in Central American
ironworks, North American canal construction companies, and a multiplicity
of other concerns. They became the major importers of bullion from the newly
discovered goldfields."
Belmont had placed large amounts of Rothschild money into the bonds of
state-sponsored banks in the South. Those bonds, of course, had fallen in
value to practically zero.
As the war shifted in favor of the North,
however, he began to buy up as many additional bonds as he could, paying but
a few pennies on each dollar of face value. It was his plan to have the
Union force the Southern states at the end of the war to honor all of their
pre-war debt obligations - in full.
That, of course, would have been a source
of gigantic speculative profits to the Rothschilds.
Meanwhile, on the northern side of the
Mason-Dixon Line, Belmont became the chief agent for the sale of Union bonds
in England and France. It was rumored that, when Belmont called on President
Lincoln and personally offered Rothschild money at 27½ per cent interest, he
was rudely thrown out of the office.
The
story is doubtful, but it represents a larger truth. Profiting from war and
placing money on both sides of the conflict were exactly the kind of
maneuvers for which the Rothschilds had become famous throughout Europe and
were now practicing in America.
In the North, the sale of government bonds was the one ^measure for raising
funds that seemed to work. Even that, however, with the lure of compounded
interest to be paid in gold at pa future date, failed to raise more than
about half the needed amount. So the Union faced a real dilemma.
The only
options remaining were,
(1) terminate the war
(2) print fiat money
For
Lincoln and the Republicans who controlled Congress, the choice Was never
seriously in doubt.
The precedent had already been set during the War of 1812. At that time,
Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin, had abrogated ihe Constitutional
ban against "bills of credit" by printing Treasury
notes, most of which paid interest at 5.4 per cent.
The money was never
declared legal tender, and that probably was the basis on which it was
defended as constitutional.
THE GREENBACKS
By the time of the War Between the States, however, all pretense at
constitutionality had been dropped.
In 1862, Congress authorized the
Treasury to print $150 million worth of bills of credit and put them into
circulation as money to pay for its expenses. They were declared as legal
tender for all private debts but could not be used for government duties or
taxes. The notes were printed with green ink and, thus, became immortalized
as "greenbacks."
Voters were assured that this was a one-time emergency
measure, a promise that was soon broken. By the end of the war, a total of
$432 million in greenbacks had been issued.
The pragmatic mood in Washington was that a constitution is nice to have in
times of peace, but an unaffordable luxury in war. Salmon P. Chase, for
example, as Secretary of the Treasury, strongly endorsed the greenbacks
which were issued under his direction. They were, in his words, an
"indispensable necessity."
Eight years later, as Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court, he declared that they were unconstitutional.
Had he changed
his mind? Not at all.
When he endorsed them, the nation was at war. When he
declared them unconstitutional, it was at peace. It was merely another
example of the universal trait of all governments in time of war.
That trait
was presented in a previous section as the premise of the Rothschild
Formula:
"The sanctity of its laws, the prosperity of its citizens, and the
solvency of its treasury will be quickly sacrificed by any government in its
primal act of self-survival."
The pressure for issuance of greenbacks originated in Congress, but Lincoln
was an enthusiastic supporter.
His view was that:
Government, possessing power to create and issue currency and credit as
money and enjoying the right to withdraw currency and credit from
circulation by taxation and otherwise, need not and should not borrow
capital at interest... The privilege of creating and issuing money is not
only the supreme prerogative of the government but it is the government's
greatest creative opportunity.1
It would appear that Lincoln objected to having the government pay interest
to the banks for money they create out of nothing when the government can
create money out of nothing just as easily and not pay interest on it.
If
one ignores the fact that both of these schemes are forbidden by the
Constitution and is willing to tolerate the plunder-by-inflation that is the
consequence of both, then there is an appealing logic to the argument.
The
politicians continue to have their fiat money, but at least the banks are
denied a free ride.
LINCOLN'S MIXED VIEW OF BANKING
It is apparent that Lincoln had undergone a change of heart regarding banks.
Early in his political career, he had been a friend |of the banking industry
and an advocate of easy credit. As a [member of the Whig political party in
the 1830s - before becoming a Republican in his campaign for the Presidency
- he had been a supporter of Biddle's Second Bank of the United States.1
During his famous debates with Senator Stephen Douglas, one of the points of
contention between the two was that Lincoln defended the Bank and advocated
its reestablishment. Furthermore, after becoming President, he took the
initiative in requesting Congress to reestablish central banking.
Lincoln appears to have been inconsistent, and one gets a gnawing feeling
that, in his effort to finance an unpopular war, he sometimes found it
necessary, like Salmon Chase and other politicians of the time, to
anesthetize his personal convictions and do whatever was required to meet
the exigencies of governmental survival.
One thing, however, is clear. Regardless of Lincoln's personal views on
money, the greenbacks were not pleasing to the bankers who were thereby
denied their customary override on government debt. They were anxious to
have this federal fiat money replaced by bank fiat money. For that to be
possible, it would be necessary to create a whole new monetary system with
government bonds used as backing for the issuance of bank notes; in other
words, a return no central banking.
And that was precisely what Secretary
Chase was preparing to establish.
In 1862, the basic position of the bankers was outlined in a memo, called
The Hazard Circular, prepared by an American agent of British financiers and
circulated among the country's wealthy businessmen.
It said:
The great debt that capitalists will see to it is made out of the war must
be used as a means to control the volume of money. To accomplish this the
bonds must be used as a banking basis.
We are now waiting for the Secretary
of the Treasury to make this recommendation to Congress. It will not do to
allow the greenback, as it is called, to circulate as money any length of
time, as we cannot control that. But we can control the bonds and through
them the bank issues.
THE NATIONAL BANKING ACT
On February 25, 1863, Congress passed the National Banking Act (with major
amendments the following year) which established a new system of
nationally-chartered banks.
The structure was similar to the Bank of the
United States with the exception that, instead of one central bank with
power to influence the activities of the others, there were now to be many
national banks with control over all of them coming from Washington. Most
banking legislation is sold to the public under the attractive label of
reform.
The National Banking Act was one of the rare exceptions. It was
promoted fairly honestly as a wartime emergency scheme to raise money for
military expenses by creating a market for government bonds and then
transforming those bonds into circulating money.
Here is how it worked:
When a national bank purchased government bonds, it did not hold on to them.
It turned them back to the Treasury which exchanged them for an equal amount
of "United States Bank Notes" with the bank's name engraved on them. The
government declared these to be legal tender for taxes and duties, and that
status caused them to be generally accepted by the public as money.
The
bank's net cost for these bonds was zero, because they got their money back
immediately. Technically, the bank still owned the bonds and collected
interest on them, but they also had the use of an equal amount of newly
created bank-note money which also could be loaned out at interest. When all
the smoke and mirrors were moved away, it was merely a variation on the
ancient scheme.
The monetary and political scientists had simply converted
government debt into money, and the bankers were collecting a substantial
fee at both ends for their service.
The one shortcoming of the system, at least from the point of view of the
manipulators, was that, even though the bank notes were widely circulated,
they were not classified as "lawful" money.
In other words, they were not
legal tender for all debts, just for taxes and duties. Precious-metal coins
and greenbacks were still the country's official money. It was not until the
arrival of the Federal Reserve System fifty years later that government debt
in the form of bank notes would be mandated as the nation's official money
for all transactions - under penalty of law.
The National Banking Act of 1863 required banks to keep a percentage of
their notes and deposits in the form of lawful money (gold coins) as a
reserve to cover the possibility of a run. That percentage varied depending
on the size and location of the bank put, on an average, it was about twelve
per cent.
That means a bank with $1 million in coin deposits could use
approximately $880,000 of that ($1 million less 12%) to purchase government
bonds, exchange the bonds for bank notes, lend out the bank notes, and
collect interest on both the bonds and the loans. The bank could now earn
interest on $880,000 loaned to the government in the form of coins plus
interest on $880,000 loaned to its customers in the form of bank notes.
That
doubled the bank's income without the inconvenience of having to increase
its capital. Needless to say, the bonds were gobbled up just as fast as they
could be printed, and the problem of funding the war had been solved.
Another consequence of the national banking system was to make it impossible
from that date forward for the federal government ever to get out of debt.
Please reread that statement. It is not £n exaggeration. Even friends of
central-banking are forced to admit this reality.
Galbraith says gloomily:
Rarely has economic circumstance managed more successfully to confound the
most prudent in economic foresight. In numerous years following the war the
Federal government ran a heavy surplus. It could not pay off its debt,
retire its securities, because to do so meant there would be no bonds to
back the national bank notes. To pay off the debt was to destroy the money
supply.1
1. Galbraith, p. 90.
As pointed out in a previous section, that is essentially the situation
which exists today.
Every dollar of our currency and checkbook money was
created by the act of lending. If all debt were repaid, our entire money
supply would vanish back into the inkwells and computers. The national debt
is the principal foundation upon which money is created for private debt. To
pay off or even greatly reduce the national debt would cripple our monetary
system. No politician would dare to advocate that, even if surplus funds
were available in the Treasury.
The Federal Reserve System, therefore, has
virtually locked our nation into perpetual debt.
THE HIDDEN COST OF WAR
The third consequence of the National Banking Act will come as no surprise
to anyone who has survived the previous pages of this book.
During the war,
the purchasing power of the greenbacks fell by 65%. The money supply
increased by 138%. Prices more than doubled while wages rose by less than
half. By that mechanism, Americans surrendered to the government and to the
banks more than half of all the money they earned or held during that period
- in addition to their taxes.
Financial conditions in the South were even worse. With the exception of the
seizure of about $400,000 in gold from the Federal mint at New Orleans,
almost all of the war was funded by the printing of fiat money.
Confederate
notes increased in volume by 214% per year, while the volume of all money,
including bank notes and check-book money, rose by over 300% per year. In
addition to the Confederate notes, each of the Southern states issued its
own fiat money and, by the end of the war, the total of all notes was about
a billion dollars. Within the four-year period, prices shot up by 9,100%.
After Appomattox, of course, Confederate notes and bonds alike were totally
worthless.
As usual, the average citizen did not understand that the newly created
money represented a hidden tax which he would soon have to pay in the form
of higher prices. Voters in the Northern states certainly would not have
tolerated an open and honest tax increase of that magnitude. Even in the
South where the cause was perceived as one of self defense, it is possible
that they would not have done so had they known in advance the true
dimension of the assessment.
But especially in the North, because they did
not understand the secret science of money, Americans not only paid the
hidden tax but applauded Congress for creating it.
On June 25, 1863, exactly four months after the National Bank Act was signed
into law, a confidential communiqué was sent from the Rothschild investment
house in London to an associate banking firm in New York.
It contained an
amazingly frank and boastful summary:
The few who understand the system [bank loans earning interest and also
serving as money] will either be so interested in its profits or so
dependent upon its favors that there will be no opposition from that class
while, on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable of
comprehending,... will bear its burdens without complaint.1
LINCOLN'S CONCERN FOR THE FUTURE
Lincoln was privately apprehensive about the Bank Act, but loyalty to his
Party and the need to maintain unity in time of war compelled him to
withhold his veto. His personal view, however, was unequivocal.
In a letter
to William Elkins the following year he said:
The money power preys upon the nation in times of peace and conspires
against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than monarchy, more
insolent than autocracy, more selfish than bureaucracy. I see in the near
future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for
the safety of my country.
Corporations have been enthroned, an era of
corruption will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to
prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people, until the
wealth is aggregated in a few hands, and the republic destroyed.2
1. Quoted by Owen, pp. 99-100.
2. A letter to William F. Elkins, November 21, 1864. Archer H. Shaw, ed.,
The Lincoln Encyclopedia; The Spoken and Written Words of A. Lincoln (New
York: MacmilJan Co., 1950), p. 40.
In reviewing Lincoln's role throughout this painful chapter of history, it
is impossible not to feel ambivalence.
On the one hand, he declared war
without Congress, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, and issued the
Emancipation Proclamation, not as an administrative executive carrying out
the wishes of Congress, but as the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.
Furthermore, the Proclamation was not issued out of humanitarian motives, as
popular history portrays, but as a maneuver to generate popular support for
the war.
By participating in the issuance of the greenbacks, he violated one
of the most clearly written and important sections of the Constitution. And
by failing to veto the National Bank Act, he acquiesced in the delivery of
the American people back into the hands of the international Cabal, an act
which was similar in many ways to the forcible return of captured
runaway slaves.
On the positive side, there is no question of Lincoln's patriotism. His
concern was in preserving the Union, not the Constitution, and his refusal
to let the European powers split America into a cluster of warring
nation-states was certainly wise.
Lincoln believed that he had to violate
part of the Constitution in order to save the whole. But that is dangerous
reasoning. It can be used in almost any national crisis as the excuse for
the expansion of totalitarian power. There is no reason to believe that the
only way to save the Union was to scrap the Constitution.
In fact, if the
Constitution had been meticulously observed from the very beginning, the
Southern minority could never have been legally plundered by the Northern
majority and there likely would have been no movement for secession in the
first place. And, even if there had been, a strict reading of the
Constitution at that point could have led the way to an honorable and
peaceful settlement of differences.
The result would have been, not only the
preservation of the Union without war, but Americans would be enjoying far
less government intervention in their daily lives today.
WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE
There is one point that is clearly on Lincoln's side.
While his political
compatriots were howling for economic vengeance against the South, the
President stood firmly against it.
"With malice toward none" was more than a
slogan with him, and he was willing to risk his political survival on that
one issue. The reason he had vetoed the Wade-Davis emancipation bill was
because it would have applied a lien against Southern cotton at the end of
the war to the benefit of New England textile manufactures.
The cotton also
would have been taken as security to pay off Southern debt which had been
contracted before the war, thus providing the funds to buy back at face
value all of the bonds which had been purchased at discount by Rothschild's
agent, August Belmont. Such defiance of the financiers and speculators
undoubtedly required great courage.
But the issue ran deeper than that. Lincoln had offered a general amnesty to
any citizen in the South who would agree to take a loyalty oath to the
Union. When ten per cent of the voters had taken such an oath, he proposed
that they could then elect Congressmen, Senators, and a state government
which would be recognized as part of the Union once again.
The Republicans,
on the other hand, had incorporated into the Wade-Davis bill the provision
that each seceded state was to be treated like a conquered country.
Political representation was to be denied until fifty-one per cent, not ten
per cent, had taken an oath.
Former slaves were given the right to vote -
although women had not yet gained that right even in the North - but,
because of their lack of education and political awareness, no one expected
them to play a meaningful role in government for many years to come.
Furthermore, those taking the oath had to swear that they had never taken up
arms against the Union. Since almost every able-bodied white male had done
so, the effect would have been to deny the South political representation
for at least two generations.
Under Lincoln's amnesty policy, it would not be long before the Republicans
would be overwhelmed in Congress by a large majority of Democrats. The
Democrats in the North were already gaining strength on their own and, once
they could be joined by the solid block of Democrats from the reunited
South, the Republicans' political and economic power would be lost.
So, when
Lincoln vetoed the bill, his own Party bitterly turned against him.
Running throughout these cross-currents of motives and special interests
were two groups which found it increasingly to their advantage to have
Lincoln out of the way. One group consisted of the financiers, Northern
industrialists, and radical Republicans, all of whom wanted to legally
plunder the South at the end of the war.
The politicians within that group
also looked forward to further consolidating their power and literally
establishing a military dictatorship.1
The other group was smaller in size but
equally dangerous. It consisted of hothead Confederate sympathizers - from
both South and North - who sought revenge.
Later events revealed that both
of these groups had been involved in a conspiratorial liaison with an
organization called the Knights of the Golden Circle.
KNIGHTS OF THE GOLDEN CIRCLE
The Order of the Knights of the Golden Circle was a secret organization
dedicated to revolution and conquest.
Two of its better known members were
Jesse James and John Wilkes Booth. It was organized by George W.L. Bickley
who established its first "castle" in Cincinnati in 1854, drawing membership
primarily from Masonic lodges. It had close ties with a secret society in
France called The Seasons, which itself was a branch of the Illuminati.2
After the beginning of the war, Bickley was made head of the Confederacy's
secret service, and his organization quickly spread throughout the border
and Southern states as well.
In the North, the conspirators were seeking,
"to seize political power and
overthrow the Lincoln government."3
In fact, the Northern anti-draft riots
mentioned previously were largely the result of the planning and leadership
of this group.4
In the South,
"they tried to promote the extension of slavery
by the conquest of Mexico."5

Web of Conspiracy: The Complete Story of the Men Who Murdered Abraham

Mifflin, 1957).

Encyclopedia, Third Edition, p. 1143.
In partnership with Maximilian, the Knights
hoped to establish a Mexican-American empire which would be an effective
counter force against the North.
In fact, the very name of the organization
is based on their goal of carving an empire out of North America with
geographical boundaries forming a circle with the center in Cuba, and its circumference reaching northward to Pennsylvania, southward to Panama.
In 1863 the group was reorganized as the Order of American Knights and,
again the following year, as the Order of the Sons of Liberty. Its
membership then was estimated at between 200,000 and 300,000.
After the war,
it went further underground and remnants eventually emerged as the Ku Klux
Klan.
JOHN WILKES BOOTH
One of the persistent legends of this period is that John Wilkes Booth was
not killed in Garrett's barn, as generally accepted, but was allowed to
escape; that the corpse actually was that of an accomplice; and that the
government, under the firm control of War Secretary Edwin M. Stanton, moved
heaven and earth to cover lip the facts.
On the face of it, that is an
absurd story. But, when the (voluminous files of the War Department were
finally declassified and put into the public domain in the mid 1930s,
historians were shocked to discover that there are many facts in those files
which end credence to the legend.
The first to probe these amazing records
was Otto Eisenschiml whose Why Was Lincoln Murdered? was published by Little,
Brown and Company in 1937. The best and most readable compilation of the
facts, however, was written twenty years later by Theodore Roscoe.
In the
preface to this work, e states the startling conclusions which emerge from
those long-hidden files:
Of the immense 19th century literature that exists on Lincoln's
assassination, much of the writing treats the tragedy at Ford's theater »s
though it were Grand Opera... Only a few have seen the crime as a murder
case: Lincoln dying by crass felony, Booth a stalking gunman leading a gang
of primed henchmen, the murder plot containing [ingredients as base as the
profit motive.
Seventy years after the crime, writers were garbling it with
a dignity it did not deserve: Lincoln, the [stereotyped martyr; Booth, the
stereotyped villain; the assassination [avenged by classic justice;
conspiracy strangled; Virtue (in the robes of Government) emerging
triumphant, and Lincoln "belonging to the ages."
But the facts of the case are neither so satisfying nor so gratifying. For
the facts indicate that the criminals responsible for Lincoln's death got
away with murder.1
1. Roscoe, p. vii.
Izola Forrester was the granddaughter of John Wilkes Booth.
In her book
entitled This One Mad Act, she tells of discovering the
secret records of the Knights of the Golden Circle which had been carefully
wrapped and placed in a government vault many decades ago and designated as
classified documents by Secretary Stanton. Since the assassination of
Lincoln, no one had ever been allowed to examine that package.
Because of
her lineage to Booth and because of her credentials as a professional
writer, she was eventually permitted to become the first person in all those
years to examine its contents.
Forrester recounts the experience:
It was five years before I was able to examine the contents of the
mysterious old package hidden away in the safe of the room which contained
the relics and exhibits used in the Conspiracy Trial... would never have
seen them, had I not knelt on the floor of the cell five years ago and
seen into the back of the old safe where the package lay.
It is all part
of the odd mystery thrown about the case by the officials of the war
period - the concealment of these documents and articles, and the hiding
away of the two flakes of bone with the bullet and pistol. What mind
ever grouped together such apparently incongruous and macabre exhibits?
Here at last was a link with my grandfather.
I knew that he had been a
member of the secret order founded by Bickley, the Knights of the Golden
Circle. I have an old photograph of him taken in a group of the brotherhood,
in full uniform, one that Harry's daughter had discovered for me in our
grandmother's Bible. I knew that the newspapers, directly following the
assassination, had denounced the order as having instigated the killing of
Lincoln, and had proclaimed Booth to have been its member and tool.
And I
was reminded again of those words I had heard from my grandmother's lips,
that her husband had been "the tool of other men."'
An interesting comment. One is compelled to wonder: The tool of what other
men? Was Forrester's grandmother referring to the leaders of the Knights of
the Golden Circle? To agents of European financiers? Or was it to
conspirators within Lincoln's own Party?
We shall probably never know with
certainty the extent to which any of these groups may have been involved in
Lincoln's assassination, but we do know that there were powerful forces
within the federal government, centered around Secretary of War Stanton,
which actively concealed evidence and hastily terminated the investigation.
Someone was protected.
SUMMARY
It is time now to leave this tragic episode and move along. So let us
summarize.
America's bloodiest and most devastating war was fought, not over
the issue of freedom versus slavery, but because of clashing economic
interests. At the heart of this conflict were questions of legalized
plunder, banking monopolies, and even European territorial expansion into
Latin America.
The boot print of the Rothschild formula is unmistakable
across the graves of American soldiers on both sides.
In the North, neither greenbacks, taxes, nor war bonds were enough to
finance the war. So a national banking system was created to convert
government bonds into fiat money, and the people lost over half of their
monetary assets to the hidden tax of inflation. In the South, printing
presses accomplished the same effect, and the monetary loss was total.
The issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation by Lincoln and the naval
assistance offered by Tsar Alexander, II, were largely responsible for
keeping England and France from intervening in the war on the side of the
Confederacy. Lincoln was assassinated by a member of the Knights of the
Golden Circle, a secret society with rumored ties to American politicians
and British financiers.
Tsar Alexander was assassinated a few years later by
a member of the People's Will, a Nihilist secret society in Russia with
rumored ties to financiers in New York City, specifically, Jacob Schiff and
the firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Company.
As for the Creature of central banking, there had been some victories and
some defeats. The greenbacks had for a while deprived the bankers of their
override on a small portion of government debt, but the National Banking Act
quickly put a stop to that.
Furthermore, by using government bonds as
backing for the money supply, it locked the nation into perpetual debt.
The
foundation was firmly in place, but the ultimate structure still Heeded to
be erected. The monetary system was yet to be concentrated into one
central-bank mechanism, and the control was yet to be taken away from the
politicians and placed into the hands of the bankers themselves.
It was time for the Creature to visit Congress.
