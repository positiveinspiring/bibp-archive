The U.S. and NATO have launched a war on Syria
by funding and training the terrorists who commit Houla-style massacres in
the Arab country, an analyst tells Press TV.
This is a war of aggression. It is not
necessarily using the instruments of conventional theater wars, which is
to come in with artillery and air force and so on, but allied Special
Forces on the ground, said Michel Chossudovsky, a professor at the
Center for Research of Globalization, Montreal.
He added that,
the U.S.-backed coalition is
staging a massive casualty-producing event in Syria, namely the killing of
civilians and blaming it on the enemy.
The historical origins of the massive casualty-producing event go back to
Operation Northwoods, an infamous 1962 Pentagon Plan, consisting of
killing civilians in the Miami Cuban community, with a view to justifying a
war on Cuba.
The plans were developed as ways to trick
the American public and the international community into supporting a
war to oust Cuba's then new leader, communist Fidel Castro, abcnews.com
reported on May 1, 2001.
On May 25, 108 people were killed in a massacre
in the town of Houla, in the volatile central province of Homs in Syria.
Less than two weeks later, a second massacre took place in the central
village of al-Qubeir in the Hama Province.
Chossudovsky added that it is not coincidental that the U.S. is
threatening China in the South China Sea and is also threatening Russia on
its European borders.
These threats are there in a sense to
convince the Russians and the Chinese that they should toe the line;
it's a blackmailing process, he said.
But I should emphasize that if any kind of broader military action were
to take place against Syria this could lead to escalation and become a
regional war, which would extend from the Eastern Mediterranean right
through to Central Asia and the Western Frontier, Chossudovsky
concluded.
