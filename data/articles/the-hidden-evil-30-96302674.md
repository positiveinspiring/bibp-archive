# The Hidden Evil - 30

Commentary
Decent people are being tortured and murdered worldwide on a massive scale,
by Non-lethal Weapons, and a colossal network of citizen informants who
operate on behalf of their respective government.
All key factions within the community, including
everyone from seniors to children, engage in the ritualistic persecution of
targeted people. Despite patriotic claims, informants are motivated by a
selfish need for personal empowerment and adventure. Scapegoating also plays
a role.
The entire group functions as a single organism
(Group Think) with a stunted mental capacity.
Installing and maintaining a dictatorship requires the creation of citizen
informant networks, as illustrated by German and Russian dictatorships.
Public participation is made possible by the use of a protocol that
dictators have used as a pretext for mass persecution.
Labeling someone a threat to national security,
and associating them with undesirable groups have been standard procedures
to destroy political enemies in past dictatorships.
Experts in the behavioral sciences and Non-lethal Weapons have worked with
Think Tanks to promote this technology as part of a New World Order.
Clearly, the program exists to destroy any opposition to their rule, or
people they just don't like. The alleged creators of this program, congress,
and the military, have openly declared that the weapons will be used on the
civilian population.
The program is thoroughly covered-up by
mainstream organizations, most probably, for reasons of national security.
The Satanic traits that the program exhibits stem from high-level Satanic
cults, such as The Order of Skull and Bones, and Bohemian Grove, which are
fused with Think Tanks. Regardless of media whitewashes, these organizations
work together to control nations and bring about a worldwide dictatorship
(New World Order).
A phased approach to stop the Hidden Evil is probably best; beginning first
with the removal of the Federal Reserve.
Joining organizations which are dedicated to
this will prove helpful. In addition, joining organizations dedicated to
truth which have already amassed a considerable amount of supporters, such
as the 9/11-Truth movement, may be effective.
Besides these things, the best thing to do is to
raise awareness.
