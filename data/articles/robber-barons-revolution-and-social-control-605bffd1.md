Introduction
For an excellent and detailed examination of this history,
Howard Zinn's
A People's History of the United States (which provided much of the
research for this article) is perhaps the most expansive and detailed
examination.
I am not attempting to serve it justice here, as there is much
left out of this historically examination than there is included.
The
purpose of this essay is to examine first of all the rise of class and labour struggle throughout the United States in the 19th century, the rise
and dominance of the 'Robber Baron' industrialists like J.P. Morgan and
John
D. Rockefeller, their convergence of interests with the state, and finally
to examine the radical new philosophies and theories that arose within the
radicalized and activated populations, such as Marxism and Anarchism.
I do
not attempt to provide exhaustive or comprehensive analyses of these
theoretical and philosophical movements, but rather provide a brief glimpse
to some of the ideas (particularly those of anarchism), and place them in
the historical context of the mass struggles of the 19th century.
America's Class Struggle
Unbeknownst to most Americans - and for that matter, most people in general
- the United States in the 19th century was in enormous upheaval, following
on the footsteps of the American Revolution, a revolution which was directed
by the landed elite in the American colonies, a new revolutionary spirit
arose in the working class populace.
The 19th century, from roughly the
1830s onwards, was one great long labour struggle in America.
In the early decades of the 19th century, Eastern capitalists in America
began to expand to the West,
"and it became important to keep that new
West, tumultuous and unpredictable, under control." [1]
The new capitalists favored monopolization over competition as a method of achieving
'stability' and "security to your own property."
The state played its
traditional role in securing business interests, as state legislatures gave
charters to corporations, granting them legal charters, and,
"between 1790 and 1860, 2,300 corporations
were chartered." [2]
However, as Howard Zinn
wrote in A People's History of the United States:
The attempts at political stability, at economic control, did not quite
work.
The new industrialism, the crowded cities, the long hours in the
factories, the sudden economic crises leading to high prices and lost jobs,
the lack of food and water, the freezing winters, the hot tenements in the
summer, the epidemics of disease, the deaths of children - these led to
sporadic reactions from the poor.
Sometimes there were spontaneous,
unorganized uprisings against the rich. Sometimes the anger was deflected
into racial hatred for blacks, religious warfare against Catholics, nativist
fury against immigrants. Sometimes it was organized into demonstrations and
strikes.[3]
In the 1830s, "episodes of insurrection" were taking place amid the
emergence of unions.
Throughout the century, it was with each economic
crisis that labor movements and rebellious sentiments would develop and
accelerate. Such was the case with the 1837 economic crisis, caused by the
banks and leading to rising prices.
Rallies and meetings started taking
place in several cities, with one rally numbering 20,000 people in
Philadelphia. That same year, New York experienced the Flour Riot. With a
third of the working class - 50,000 people - out of work in New York alone,
and nearly half of New York's 500,000 people living "in utter and hopeless
distress," thousands of protesters rioted, ultimately leading to police and
troops being sent in to crush the protesters.[4]
In 1835 there had been a successful general strike in Philadelphia, where
fifty trade unions had organized in favor of a ten-hour work day. In this
context, political parties began creating divides between workers and lower
class people, as antagonisms developed between many Protestants and
Catholics.
Thus, middle class politicians,
"led each group into a different
political party (the nativists into the American Republican party, the Irish
into the Democratic party), party politics and religion now substituting
for class conflict." [5]
Another economic crisis took place in 1857, and in 1860, a Mechanics
Association was formed, demanding higher wages, and called for a strike.
Within a week, strikes spread from Lynn, Massachusetts, to towns across the
state and into New Hampshire and Maine,
"with Mechanics Associations in
twenty-five towns and twenty thousand shoe-workers on strike," marking the
largest strike prior to the Civil War.[6]
Yet,
"electoral politics drained the energies of
the resisters into the channels of the system."
While
European workers were struggling for economic justice and political
democracy, American workers had already achieved political democracy, thus,
"their economic battles could be taken over
by political parties that blurred class lines." [7]
The Civil War (1861-1865) served several purposes.
First of all, the
immediate economic considerations: the Civil War sought to create a single
economic system for America, driven by the Eastern capitalists in the midst
of the Industrial Revolution, uniting with the West against the slave-labor
South. The aim was not freedom for black slaves, but rather to end a system
which had become antiquated and unprofitable.
With the Industrial Revolution
driving people into cities and mechanizing production, the notion of slavery
lost its appeal: it was simply too expensive and time consuming to raise,
feed, house, clothe and maintain slaves; it was thought more logical and
profitable (in an era obsessed with efficiency) to simply pay people for the
time they engage in labor.
The Industrial Revolution brought with it the
clock, and thus time itself became a commodity. As slavery was indicative of
human beings being treated as commodities to be bought and sold, owned and
used, the Industrial Revolution did not liberate people from servitude and
slavery, it simply updated the notions and made more efficient the system of
slavery: instead of purchasing people, they would lease them for the time
they can be 'productive'.
Living conditions for the workers and the vast majority, however, were not
very different from the conditions of slavery itself.
Thus, as the Civil War
was sold to the public on the notion of liberating the slaves in the South,
the workers of the North felt betrayed and hateful that they must be drafted
and killed for a war to liberate others when they themselves were struggling
for liberation.
Here, we see the social control methods and reorganizing of
society that can take place through war, a fact that has always existed and
remains today, made to be even more prescient with the advances in
technology. During the Civil War, the class conflict among the working
people of the United States transformed into a system where they were
divided against each other, as religious and racial divisions increasingly
erupted in violence.
With the Conscription Act of 1863, draft riots erupted
in several Northern U.S. cities, the most infamous of which was the New York
draft riots, when for three days mobs of rioters attacked recruiting
stations, wealthy homes, destroying buildings and killing blacks. Roughly
four hundred people were killed after Union troops were called into the city
to repress the riots.[8]
In the South, where the vast majority of people
were not slave owners, but in fact poor white farmers "living in shacks or
abandoned outhouses, cultivating land so bad the plantation owners had
abandoned it," making little more than blacks for the same work (30 cents a
day for whites as opposed to 20 cents a day for blacks). When the Southern
Confederate Conscription Law was implemented in 1863, anti-draft riots
erupted in several Southern cities as well.[9]
When the Civil War ended in 1865, hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned
to squalor conditions in the major cities of America.
In New York alone,
100,000 people lived in slums. These conditions brought a surge in labor
unrest and struggle, as 100,000 went on strike in New York, unions were
formed, with blacks forming their own unions.
However, the National Labor
Union itself suppressed the struggle for rights as it focused on 'reforming'
economic conditions (such as promoting the issuance of paper money),
"it became less an organizer of labor
struggles and more a lobbyist with Congress, concerned with voting, it
lost its vitality." [10]
The Robber Barons Against Americans
In 1873, another major economic crisis took place, setting off a great
depression.
Yet, economic crises, while being harmful to the vast majority
of people, increasing prices and decreasing jobs and wages, had the effect
of being very beneficial to the new industrialists and financiers, who use
crisis as an opportunity to wipe out competition and consolidate their
power. Howard Zinn elaborated:
The crisis was built into a system which was chaotic in its nature, in which
only the very rich were secure. It was a system of periodic crisis - 1837,
1857, 1873 (and later: 1893, 1907, 1919, 1929) - that wiped out small
businesses and brought cold, hunger, and death to working people while the
fortunes of the
Astors, Vanderbilts,
Rockefellers, Morgans, kept growing
through war and peace, crisis and recovery.
During the 1873 crisis, Carnegie
was capturing the steel market, Rockefeller was wiping out his competitors
in oil.[11]
In 1877, a nation-wide railroad strike took place, infuriating the major
railroad barons, particularly J.P. Morgan, offered to lend money to pay army
officers to go in and crush the strikes and get the trains moving, which
they managed to accomplish fairly well.
Strikes took place and soldiers were
sent in to Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Indiana, with the
whole city of Philadelphia in uproar, with a general strike emerging in
Pittsburgh, leading to the deployment of the National Guard, who often shot
and killed strikers.
When all was said and done, a hundred people were dead,
a thousand people had gone to jail, 100,000 workers had gone on strike, and
the strikes had roused into action countless unemployed in the cities.[12]
Following this period, America underwent its greatest spur of economic
growth in its history, with elites from both North and South working
together against workers and blacks and the majority of people:
They would do it with the aid of, and at the expense of, black labor, white
labor, Chinese labor, European immigrant labor, female labor, rewarding them
differently by race, sex, national origin, and social class, in such a way
as to create separate levels of oppression - a skillful terracing to
stabilize the pyramid of wealth.[13]
The bankers and industrialists, particularly Morgan, Rockefeller, Carnegie,
Mellon and Harriman, saw enormous increases in wealth and power. At the turn
of the century, as Rockefeller moved from exclusively interested in oil, and
into iron, copper, coal, shipping, and banking (with Chase Manhattan Bank,
now J.P. Morgan Chase), his fortune would equal $2 billion. The Morgan Group
also had billions in assets.[14]
In 1900, Andrew Carnegie agreed to sell his
steel company to J.P. Morgan for $492 million.[15]
Public sentiment at this time, however, had never been so anti-Capitalist
and spiteful of the great wealth amassed at the expense of all others. The
major industrialists and bankers firmly established their control over the
political system, firmly entrenching the two party system through which they
would control both parties.
Thus,
"whether Democrats or Republicans won,
national policy would not change in any important way." [16]
Labour struggles
had continued and exacerbated throughout the decades following the Civil
War. In 1893, another economic depression took place, and the country was
again plunged into social upheaval.
The Supreme Court itself was firmly overtaken by the interests of the new
elite. Shortly after the Fourteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution
to protect newly freed blacks, the Supreme Court began "to develop it as a
protection for corporations," as corporate lawyers argued that corporations
were defined as legal 'persons', and therefore they could not have their
rights infringed upon as stipulated in the Fourteenth Amendment.
The Supreme
Court went along with this reasoning, and even intervened in state
legislative decisions which instead promoted the rights of workers and
farmers.
Ultimately,
"of the Fourteenth Amendment cases brought
before thee Supreme Court between 1890 and 1910, nineteen dealt with the
Negro, 288 dealt with corporations." [17]
It was in this context that increasing social unrest was taking place, and
thus that new methods of social control were becoming increasingly
necessary.
Among the restless and disgruntled masses, were radical new
social theories that had emerged to fill a void - a void which was created
by the inherent injustice of living in a human social system in which there
is a dehumanizing power structure.
Philosophies of Liberation and Social Dislocation
It was in this context that new theories and philosophies emerged to fill
the void created by the hegemonic ideologies and the institutions which
propagate them.
While these various critical philosophies expanded human
kind's understanding of the world around them, they did not emerge in a
vacuum - that is, separate from various hegemonic ideas, but rather, they
were themselves products of and to varying degrees espoused certain biases
inherent in the hegemonic ideologies.
This arose in the context of
increasing class conflict in both the United States and Europe, brought
about as a result of the Industrial Revolution.
Two of the pre-eminent
ideologies and philosophies that emerged were,
Marxist theory, originating with German philosopher
Karl Marx, expanded
human kind's understanding of the nature of capitalism and human society as
a constant class struggle, in which the dominant class (the bourgeoisie),
who own the means of production (industry) exploit the lower labor class
(proletariat) for their own gain.
Within Marxist theory, the state itself
was seen as a conduit through which economic powers would protect their own
interests. Marxist theory espoused the idea of a "proletarian revolution" in
which the "workers of the world unite" and overthrow the bourgeoisie,
creating a Communist system in which class is eliminated.
However, Karl Marx
articulated a concept of a "dictatorship of the proletariat" in which upon
seizing power, the proletariat would become the new ruling class, and serve
its own interests through the state to effect a transition to a Communist
society and simultaneously prevent a counterrevolution from the bourgeoisie.
Karl Marx wrote in the Communist Manifesto (1848) also on the need for a
central bank to manage the monetary system.
These concepts led to
significant conflict between Marxist and Anarchist theorists.
Anarchism is one of the most misunderstood philosophies in modern historical
thought, and with good reason: it's revolutionary potential was boundless,
as it was an area of thought that was not as rigid, doctrinaire or divisive
as other theories, both hegemonic and critical.
No other philosophy or
political theory had the potential to unite both socialists and
libertarians, two seemingly opposed concepts that found a home within the
wide spectrum of anarchist thought, leading to a situation in which many
anarchists refer to themselves as 'libertarian socialists.'
As Nathan Jun
has pointed out:
[A]narchism has never been and has never aspired to be a fixed,
comprehensive, self-contained, and internally consistent system of ideas,
set of doctrines, or body of theory.
On the contrary, anarchism from its
earliest days has been an evolving set of attitudes and ideas that can apply
to a wide range of social, economic, and political theories, practices,
movements, and traditions.[18]
Susan Brown noted that within Anarchist philosophy,
"there are mutualists,
collectivists, communists, federalists, individualists, socialists,
syndicalists, [and] feminists," and thus, "Anarchist political philosophy is
by no means a unified movement." [19]
The word "anarchy" is derived from the
Greek word anarkhos, which means "without authority."
Thus, anarchy "is
committed first and foremost to the universal rejection of coercive
authority," and that:
[C]oercive authority includes all centralized and hierarchical forms of
government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism,
etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism,
slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman
Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and
imperialism.[20]
The first theorist to describe himself as anarchist was Pierre-Joseph
Proudhon, a French philosopher and socialist who understood,
"equality not just as an abstract feature of
human nature but as an ideal state of affairs that is both desirable and
realizable." [21]
While this was a common concept
among socialists, anarchist conceptions of equality emphasized that,
"true
anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that
every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or
live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact," as
"individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal
opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality." [22]
Mikhail Bakunin, one of the most prominent anarchist theorists in history,
who was also Karl Marx's greatest intellectual challenger and opposition,
explained that individual freedom depends upon not only recognizing, but "cooperating in [the] realization of others' freedom," as, he wrote:
My freedom... is the freedom of all since I am not truly free in thought and
in fact, except when my freedom and my rights are confirmed and approved in
the freedom and rights of all men and women who are my equals.[23]
Anarchists view representative forms of government, such as Parliamentary
democracies, with the same disdain as they view overtly totalitarian
structures of government.
The reasoning is that:
In the political realm, representation involves divesting individuals and
groups of their vitality - their power to create, transform, and change
themselves.
To be sure, domination often involves the literal destruction of
vitality through violence and other forms of physical coercion. As a
social-physical phenomenon, however, domination is not reducible to
aggression of this sort.
On the contrary, domination operates chiefly by
"speaking for others" or "representing others to themselves" - that is, by
manufacturing images of, or constructing identities for, individuals and
groups.[24]
Mikhail Bakunin wrote that,
"Only individuals, united through mutual aid
and voluntary association, are entitled to decide who they are, what
they shall be, how they shall live."
Thus, with any hierarchical or coercive
institutions, the natural result is oppression and domination, or in other
words, spiritual death.[25]
Anarchism emerged indigenously and organically in America, separate from its
European counterparts.
The first anarchists in America could be said to be,
"the Antinomians, Quakers, and other
left-wing religious groups who found the authority, dogma, and formalism
of the conventional churches intolerable."
These various religious groups came to develop,
"a political outlook which emphasized the
anti-libertarian nature of the state and government."
One of the leaders of these religious groups, Adin Ballou,
declared that,
"the essence of Christian morality is the
rejection of force, compromise, and the very institution of government
itself."
Thus, a
Christian,
"is not merely to refrain from committing
personal acts of violence but is to take positive steps to prevent the
state from carrying out its warlike ambitions." [26]
This development occurred within the first
decades of the 19th century in America.
In the next phase of American philosophical anarchism, inspiration was drawn
from the idea of individualism. Josiah Warren, known as the "first American
anarchist," had published the first anarchist periodical in 1833, the
Peaceful Revolutionist.
Many others joined Warren in identifying the state
as "the enemy" and,
"maintaining that the only legitimate form
of social control is self-discipline which the individual must impose
upon himself without the aid of government."
Philosophical anarchism grew in popularity,
and in the 1860s, two loose federations of anarchists were formed in the New
England Labor Reform League and the American Labor Reform League, which,
"were the source of radical vitality in
America for several decades."
American anarchists were simultaneously developing similar outlooks and
ideas as Proudhon was developing in Europe.
One of the most prominent
American anarchists, Benjamin Tucker, translated Proudhon's work in 1875,
and started his own anarchist journals and publications, becoming,
"the chief political theorist of
philosophical anarchism in America." [27]
Tucker viewed anarchism as,
"a rejection of all formalism, authority, and
force in the interest of liberating the creative capacities of the
individual," and that, "the anarchist must remove himself from the arena of
politics, refusing to implicate himself in groups or associations which
have as their end the control or manipulation of political power."
Thus, Tucker,
like other anarchists,
"ruled out the concepts of parliamentary and
constitutional government and in general placed himself and the
anarchist movement outside the tradition of democracy as it had
developed in America."
Anarchism has widely been viewed as a violent philosophy, and while that may
be the case for some theorists and adherents, many anarchist theorists and
philosophies rejected the notion of violence altogether.
After all, its
first adherents in America were driven to anarchist theory simply as a
result of their uncompromising pacifism.
For the likes of Tucker and other
influential anarchist theorists,
"the state, rather than being a real
structure or entity, is nothing more than a conception. To destroy the
state then, is to remove this conception from the mind of the
individual."
Thus,
the act of revolution,
"has nothing whatever to do with the actual overthrow
of the existing governmental machinery," and Proudhon opined that, "a true
revolution can only take place as mankind becomes enlightened."
Revolution,
to anarchists, was not an imminent reality, even though it may be an
inevitable outcome:
The one thing that is certain is that revolution takes place not by a
concerted uprising of the masses but through a process of individual social
reformation or awakening. Proudhon, like Tucker and the native American
anarchists, believed that the function of anarchism is essentially
educational...
The state will be abolished at the point at which people in
general have become convinced of its un-social nature... When enough people
resist it to the point of ignoring it altogether, the state will have been
destroyed as completely as a scrap of paper is when it is tossed into a
roaring fire.[28]
In the 1880s, anarchism was taken up by many of the radical immigrants
coming into America from Europe, such as Johann Most and Emma Goldman, a
Jewish Russian feminist anarchist.
The press portrayed Goldman "as a vile
and unsavory devotee of revolutionary violence." Goldman partook in an
attempted assassination of Henry C. Frick, an American industrialist and
financier, historically known as one of the most ruthless businessmen and
referred to as "the most hated man in America."
This was saying something in
the era of J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. Emma
Goldman later regretted the attempted assassination and denounced violence
as an anarchist methodology.
However, she came to acknowledge a view similar
to Kropotkin's (another principle anarchist philosopher), "that violence is
the natural consequence of repression and force":
The state, in her opinion, sows the seeds of violence when it lends it
authority and force to the retardation of social change, thereby creating
deep-seated feelings of injustice and desperation in the collective
unconscious. "I do not advocate violence, government does this, and force
begets force." [29]
The general belief was that,
"social violence is never arbitrary and
meaningless. There is always a deep-seated cause standing behind every
deed."
Thus:
Social violence, she argued, will naturally disappear at the point at which
men have learned to understand and accommodate themselves to one another
within a dynamic society which truly values human freedom.
Until then we can
expect to see pent up hostility and frustration of certain individuals and
groups explode from time to time with the spontaneity and violence of a
volcano.[30]
Thus we have come to take a brief glimpse of the social upheaval and
philosophies gripping and spreading across the American (and indeed the
European) landscape in the 19th century.
As a radical reaction to the
revolutionizing changed brought by the Industrial Revolution, class
struggle, labor unrest, Marxism and Anarchism arose within a populace deeply
unsatisfied, horrifically exploited, living in desperation and squalor, and
lighting within them a spark - a desire - for freedom and equality.
They
were not ideologically or methodologically unified, specifically in terms of
the objectives and ends; yet, their enemies were the same. It as a struggle
among the people against the prevailing and growing sources of power: the
state and Capitalist industrialization. The emergence of corporations in
America after the Civil War (themselves a creation of the state), created
new manifestations of exploitation, greed and power.
The Robber Barons were
the personification of 'evil' and in fact were quite openly and brazenly
ruthless. The notion of 'public relations' had not yet been invented, and so
the industrialists would openly and violently repress and crush struggles,
strikes and protests. The state was, after all, firmly within their grip.
It was this revolutionary fervor that permeated the conniving minds of the
rich and powerful within America, that stimulated the concepts of social
control, and laid the foundations for the emergence of the 20th century as
the 'century of social engineering.'
