Part 4: The Illuminati - Freemason Connection
Q: Svali, one of the more important points, which I am sure a lot of
readers would like to know more about, is, what is the Illuminati
/Freemason connection, as far as you are aware of, given your
previous position in the Illuminati?
Was - and is - there an infiltration of the
Masonic Order?
A: The Freemasons and the
Illuminati are hand in glove. I don't care
if this steps on any toes, it's a fact. The masonic temple at
Alexandria, Virginia (the city itself was named after Alexandria,
Egypt, and is a hotbed of Illuminati activity) is a center in the
Washington, DC area for Illuminati scholarship and teaching. I was
taken there at intervals for testing, to step up a level, for
scholarship, and high ceremonies. The leaders in this masonic group
were also Illuminists.
This has been true of every large city I have lived in. The
top
Freemasons were also top Illuminists. My maternal grandparents were
both high ranking Masons in the city of Pittsburgh, Pa. (president
of the Eastern Star and 33rd degree Mason) and they both were also
leaders in the Illuminati in that area.
Are all Masons Illuminati? No, especially at the lower levels, I
believe they know nothing of the practices that occur in the middle
of the night in the larger temples. Many are probably fine
businessmen and Christians. But I have never known a 32 degree or
above who wasn't Illuminati, and the group helped create Freemasonry
as a "front" for their activities.
Q: What exactly is the meaning of the
pyramid on the back of the $1
U.S. note? I'm talking about the pyramid with the capstone detached
and hovering above the rest of the pyramid, containing the
'All-Seeing-Eye'. Is this a Masonic or Illuminati symbol?
A: The pyramid and the "eye of Horus" on the back of the dollar bill
are Illuminati symbology. The pyramid is an ancient form based on
the holyness of the number 3 to the ancient mystery religions (it,
not 6, is considered the most spiritual number), and a pyramid was a
structure used specifically to call up the demonic, or occult, a
point of psychic activity.
The eye is the all seeing eye of Horus (remember the emphasis on
Egyptian magical religious practices? The book of the undead, etc.?)
and the fact that no one can escape his magical reach. This eye is
considered a demonic eye in the group, or the eye of the deity, and
in Illuminati mythology is either open or closed, depending upon the
spiritual time of year and the state of the person psychically.
Young children are given "psychic surgery" where the eye is placed
inside, and they are told that Horus will snatch their soul if they
ever try to leave, or if they tell, or that the eye will explode.
The symbol on the dollar is reinforcement for every Illuminati child
who sees one, and the reminder that they are being watched.
The saying on the dollar, 'Novus Ordo Seclorum' also means "bringing
in the new order", which is the Illuminati stated agenda. Just
think, in the early 1800's, our forefathers already were looking
forward to when the new order would be ushered in. Have I mentioned
that this is a patient, forward looking group of intellectuals? That
Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, FDR, and others were Illuminati
leaders? Our country may have been founded on freedom from taxation,
but it was also founded on the
New World Order just as surely.
Q: How far back in time does the concept / cult of the Illuminati
go? It seems to me that they have been around quite some time,
possibly since antiquity, guiding, steering and using humanity for
their own purposes, operating under different names? Can you
elaborate?
A: I was taught that the Illuminati
had its roots in the ancient
practices that reach into the beginning of recorded time; that the
Babylonians on the plains created ziggurats to their deities, whom
the Illuminati worship. They were proud of the fact that it was
supposedly an unbroken occult line from then until now. The names
changed, the basic group was the same.
The ancient mystery religions of
Egypt, heart of dark magic were
another forerunner, with adherents of Set, Osiris,
Horus and Ra; and
the Illuminists also believe their bloodlines have come down from
the ancient kings of Egypt.
It's hard for me to know how much was cult propaganda, and how much
truth is in the claims. The Templar Knights were definitely a
forerunner during medieval times, as well as the Rosicrucians and
ancient celts and druids (you know, the ones who built Stonehenge).
