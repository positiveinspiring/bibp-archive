Over the top does not describe it. Corporo-fascism
falls short. Even police state is only two-dimensional.
Oligarchical dystopian cryptocracy? Maybe...
Shadow government starts to give the feel.
It's just a plain weird type of bad. Limited terms of the past that imply
some kind of conventional societal dynamics at play are now obsolete.
We've moved into a new dimension and we need to
see this planetary change for what it is:
A full scale takeover by virtual external
forces out for the total subjugation of planet earth.
It's flat out war on humanity...
The Fast and Furious
Totalitarian Rollout
Hillary Clinton is happily piloting much of this
international totalitarian insanity.
Championing not just Afghan and Iraqi wars,
Libyan, Syrian and Iranian invasions and other murderous forays in the
region and anywhere in the world, ol' miss
CFR
is sucking up (below video) to any and every Illuminati think tank proposal and potential
job upgrade she can.
Worse yet, the American freemasonic Capitolian Hill is generating an
inundating tidal wave of oppressive controls at home at the same time. And
without a whimper of protest.
Look what we've seen transpire in the past few weeks:
The
NDAA Bill which imposes virtual
martial
law on America now includes censorship-freak Lieberman's disgusting
Enemy Expatriation Act.
And now they just rolled out the
Bureau of Counter-terrorism that admittedly wants to tightly
network the policing and surveillance activities of the entire flipping
world!
All this while
FEMA camps are
openly staffed for some
unknown reason, drones are employed on American soil, and
Homeland Security
gets an upgrade to start random checkpoints around the country!
Enough evidence? There's plenty more of this insanity.
Are We Now Down to
Brute Force?
Reasoning obviously isn't a factor any more. The mind controlled public
sways like seaweed in a tidal pool. And the manipulators know it. The
sedative has taken effect and they can begin their crude, surgical
operation. The patient is clearly sound asleep.
But not me, nor many of us. We're wide awake and you ain't touchin' nothin'
on us, you goddamned bastards.
Check your oppression at the door. You're time is up. We ain't takin' it and
you can officially go to hell.
Period...
