Did the New World Order
plan
the drug scene?
Early Christian
Priests used drugs (mana, the food of the gods)
This Awareness indicates this is
in the affirmative. This Awareness reminds you that the ancient Templars and
the priests of old all were familiar with the use of drugs. The priest's hats
in antiquity or in ancient times were made to reflect and portray the shape
and color of the psilocybin mushroom, the so-called "sacred mushroom."
This Awareness indicates that this goes back to the early days of Christianity
and beyond and these priests called that mushroom Mana, which was said to
be the food of the gods.
This Awareness indicates that is
not hard to extrapolate from this that the priests of old were using mushrooms
to get insight and to get certain benefits, and very likely they traded and
sold mushrooms to one another for special purposes or favors, and these mushrooms
being used in the secret schools, in secret organizations of the Templars,
which then later spawned Masonry, which is essentially a key element of the
New World Order, and the introduction of various drugs in more recent times
by the CIA in its
MK-Ultra programs and others; all of this has helped to
destroy the cohesion of society from the Fifties to the Nineties so that there
are many fragmented unravelings occurring all over society in all countries
where these things operate, so that any glue that held society together is
becoming dissolved, and the Christian age is unraveling, more and more with
every decade that passes.
That in the NWO plans, the control
of drugs is extremely important for those who seek power, because they see,
because they see the potential for using drugs to manipulate entire citizens
and the masses of society in the future, particularly if there is a master/slave
society.
NWO would
drug the slaves of society
The use of drugs for keeping the
slaves working longer hours and with more efforts could be engineered through
the use of drugs they receive, and the more drugs they receive, the more work
that can be extracted from them. This Awareness indicates that this is part
of the projected plan. It also would allow entities to work themselves to
death and by diminishing the population, entities could then help in their
own demise by taking the drugs given to promote more work out of them.
This Awareness indicates that the
problem with this is that they may become obsessed with getting more work,
to death, masses of workers will be dying off, and it could reach a point
where as the population diminishes, they may want to increase the population
so that they can continue having a work force, in which case they will then
seek drugs that make entities more sexually focused, but this is not likely
to come for many decades, according to their plans, and then only if the drug
culture becomes a total workable form of control.
Imagine
50 million people dependent on drugs and paid in drugs
This awareness suggests you imagine
50 million people dependent on drugs, getting their work orders and getting
paid in drugs, wherein other aspects of their lives are skimpy and lacking,
but they still get their drugs to make them feel good, if they work hard,
and they can get drugs that get them to work harder and still feel relatively
good, but it takes years off their lives. Can you imagine a society that finds
this to be ever more rewarding in terms of profit than the mere taxation of
wages?
