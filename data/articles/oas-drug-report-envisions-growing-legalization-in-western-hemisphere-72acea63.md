NEW YORK
The
Organization of American States (OAS)
on Friday,
released a report laying out a
future in which more countries in the Western Hemisphere legalize marijuana.
Although marijuana decriminalization and
legalization was only one "scenario" outlined in the report, drug policy
reform advocates praised it as a sign of an increasingly open conversation
about alternatives to the war on drugs.
The OAS delivered the report to Colombia's
president, Juan Manuel Santos. It commissioned the report at last
year's Americas summit in Cartagena, Colombia.
Trying "alternative legal and regulatory
regimes, starting with cannabis," the report found, could lead to,
"reallocation of resources from controlling drugs and drug users to
preventing and treating problematic use (and) shrinkage of some criminal
markets and profits through regulation."
Santos' country has received billions of dollars
in U.S. aid meant to go toward drug eradication, but he has previously
stated he is open to some form of legalization.
He is one of a growing number of Latin American
leaders
on record calling for a new approach to drugs.
"Let it be clear that no one here is
defending any position, neither legalization, nor regulation, nor war at
any cost. What we have to do is use serious and well-considered
studies," Santos said in a statement.
The report, he added,
"will be the basis for a long postponed
discussion."
That discussion may continue in a June assembly
the OAS will hold in Guatemala.
There is far from a consensus within the
organization about how to handle changes to drug policy, but reformers say
they are encouraged that it is no longer taboo for prominent leaders to
discuss legalization.
"It's the first report, as far as I know, by
any multilateral organization anywhere, that actually includes the
options of decriminalization, legalization on an equal footing with the
status quo policies," said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the
Drug Policy Alliance.
The OAS report mentions legalization efforts in
Colorado and Washington State as a potential touchstone for countries in
South America,
like Uruguay, considering similar moves.
In an opinion article in Colombia's largest
daily published Thursday, however, U.S. drug czar Gil Kerlikowske
argued that legalization is "not a viable option."
At the Cartagena summit last year, President
Barack Obama
said discussing changes to drug laws was "legitimate" but rejected
legalization.
"The U.S. government has spent so much
energy, for so many years and decades, trying to suppress, to censor, to
delegitimize any kind of fair and open discussion of alternatives to the
prohibitionist regime," said Nadelmann.
The fact that the report candidly discusses
legalization, he said,
"even if just in the form of scenario
options, really represents a major breakthrough."
