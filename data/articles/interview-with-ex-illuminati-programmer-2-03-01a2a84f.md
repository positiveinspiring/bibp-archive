Q: I would think that California would be one of the major 'turfs'
of the Illuminati, and I'm thinking specifically Hollywood. What's
your inside on this, in regards to film making, symbology, subliminals, the whole scene in general?
A: Oh, boy, do you have a few hours? I'll try to be brief.
The
Illuminati believe that to control the media is to control the
public. This is one of their stated agendas. Remember, finances,
media, law, government and education are the areas they targeted as
being the best to dominate society.
How do they do this? They don't go to a film producer and say, "Oh,
by the way, we're Illuminati members and we want you to make a movie
that promotes our agenda". (Remember, they aren't stupid, either).
Instead, they will form a small investment corporation that funds
movies with ideas that they like. They quietly hire actors and
producers and directors and scripts, but they never mention their
affiliation publicly or why they are doing this.
Money talks, and especially in Hollywood. If you have money, you can
get about anything made, and they know this. They can also channel
money into advertising campaigns, etc. for their films (how many
Christian films have had major ad campaigns in the past twenty
years? Very few. How many occult movies have? I rest my case).
This has been a slow, subtle process because they are patient. They
have been working behind the scenes for hundreds of years, and they
know that the public is slow to accept new ideas, that it has to be
done gradually. (They call it leading in the "sheep" which is one of
their terms for the "unenlightened"). And it has been. The number of
occult films that has come out in the past ten years alone should
make anyone pause and think.
Why so many films with this theme? Why the desensitization of
America's youth to the occult and magic? Just look at Saturday
morning cartoons. I don't allow my children to watch them, except
for "animaniacs" and Bugs Bunny at times. Instead, we rent old
classics with Audrey Hepburn and John Wayne. I can send you some
articles that did an excellent job of investigating Walt Disney (he
was an Illuminist, and Fantasia was used to program children).
Some films that blatantly portray the Illuminist agenda:
The Matrix.
You could have peeled me off the ceiling when I saw that one. The
references to conditioning and the core were so blatant, it wasn't
funny. Fight Club: I love Brad Pitt and Ed Norton, and this film is
a nod at the covert military buildup going on that the average
person doesn't realize. Also, Ed is dissociative in the film, as
Pitt's character takes over (notice that the cult-creating military
figure is the "stronger" one in the story?).
The
Labyrinth: I haven't seen this, but my husband did, and
everything he mentioned is pure Illuminati programming stories used
with children. Any movies with an occult viewpoint, or that show
supernatural psychic phenomena, astral travel, or contact with the
spirit world are guaranteed to be part of this agenda. I don't watch
them, myself. Saw enough of the real thing to last me this lifetime.
The sensationalization of rituals and other occult insignia on
television is another example. Ghost stories. Witch stories.
Children's books about Wizards and their training that are extremely
popular.
Oh, yes, Starship Trooper. This one had so many cult symbols (the
Illumnists have a strong Aryan ideology going, too) that I almost
laughed outright when I saw it. I counted at least 100 in it.
Someone had fun going tongue-in-cheek with the Illuminist agenda in
that one.
Many fine actors and actresses are being used in films funded by
these people. Some may know the agenda, most probably do not, as
long as they receive a pay check. Some are also Illuminists as well,
although I don't know who is. I do know a few, but I don't want to
risk a libel suit here.
Anyway, I was too busy training and going to meetings and learning
the effects of drugs on people to pay much attention to that part of
the group when I was in it, sorry, I don't have lots of famous names
in my memories. I lived a very relatively boring life as a teacher
and head trainer, and we rarely discussed the media except the fact
that it, too, was another tool to bring in "The New Order",
which is
the motivation for all Illuminists.
I want to address another misconception. That is, the one that the
Illuminists know that they are evil. When I was in the group, I and
those around me were idealogically committed to the agenda as being
GOOD. I thought I was helping others reach their full potential when
I was a trainer.
I believed that after years of sweat and hard work, that my
intelligence won out, and that I made an excellent leader. I fought
Jonathan and others on the council when I thought they were unfair,
and stood up for the people beneath me. Others did the same. They
honestly think they are doing a GOOD thing, and if you told them it
was wrong, or evil, they would look confused.
It took a LOT of therapy and deprogramming myself, doing reality
checks with noncult people to realize that it was all a lie. I was
devastated. I had dedicated my life to helping others bring in the
glorious new order, and then found out it was EVIL and abusive. I
went through a period of intense grieving/mourning over this.
Most Illuminists I knew weren't evil, they were deceived. Only the
top leadership perhaps were consciously being hurtful.
