If your elected officials were really serious in solving the so-called terror problem, they would not take away more of your freedoms and rights.
No, the first and most logical action they would take is the immediate firing of the Israeli-owned company called International Consultants on Targeted Security (ICTS) and take away their legal permits to do any more activity in the security branch.
ICTS has a unique record of consistent failure of managing the security, exactly the core element of their activities.
In a normal world and during a real criminal investigation all current and past ICTS officials and employees would be obligated to cooperate in an in depth investigation into their work methods, especially during the numerous acts of "muslim terror" that are succeeding cum laude mainly due to the apparently NON security work methods of ICTS.
Due to the miserable, shameful and suspicious performance of this shady enterprise run by security experts (failures), we were able to witness yet another astounding successful "terrorist attack" on the airport of Zaventem, Brussels.
And as is usual during terror attacks, ICTS handles the security operations at Brussels airport, the scene of the latest bomb attack.
There are many links between Israeli operatives and 9/11.
One of the most important is the link with the security firm ICTS that is headed by former Israeli military commanding officers and veterans of government intelligence and security agencies.
ICTS was responsible for airport security at three of the four airports that the hijacked airlines departed from on 9/11. They somehow missed all of the hijackers and almost all CCTV's failed at that day.
Failure of the CCTV's during alleged "Muslim terror attacks" are apparently standard operation procedures for the "security" charlatans at ICTS.
The only reason for a security firm that is operated by former and active Mossad operatives to fail at such a consistent and unprecedented level must be that the ones in charge are either suffering from cognitive degeneration or are simply complicit.
One of the numerous indications of ICTS's complicity in the 9/11 attacks is that a few hours before the Patriot Act was voted onto the statute book, it was edited to make foreign companies in charge of security on 9/11, immune to lawsuits.
This effectively prevented American courts from demanding that ICTS provide testimony or hand over surveillance videos from the airports.
Maybe due to the fact that the Israeli Zionist power structure has the US and Western political arena in a stronghold we hear no sound of criticism about these blatant criminal acts of corruption from any politician, or suggestion from any justice department to take a closer look in the where and what abouts of the ever-present eyewitness at the terror crime scenes?
Silence is treason, period...
Netherlands-based ICTS was established in 1982 by former members of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency and El Al airline security agents, and has a major presence around the world in airport security including operations in,
the Netherlands Germany Spain Italy Portugal Japan Russia
the Netherlands
Germany
Spain
Italy
Portugal
Japan
Russia
ICTS uses the security system employed in Israel, whereby passengers are profiled to assess the degree to which they pose a potential threat on the basis of a number of indicators, including age, name, origin and behavior during questioning.
Works really good does it?
Chairman of the Supervisory Board at ICTS is Menachem J. Atzmon.
Atzmon is a former Likud party member who was indicted and convicted in 1996 in a fraud and embezzlement case relating to the misappropriation of funds raised by charities.
Atzmon is also the CEO of the port authority of Rostock in Germany.
At Schiphol Airport on Christmas Day, 2009, ICTS allowed the the young knicker bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, groomed, sheep-dipped and expended, to bring 'terror' to your doorstep.
The Underwear Bomber, armed with explosives and without a passport, managed miraculously to slip past "sniffer" detectors to board a Detroit-bound Northwest flight - an incident that was a major boon to the global war on terrorism.
Today's professional muslim terrorists usually bring their passports, Koran, ISIS/Al Qaida flag and/or testament to the scene of their 'suicide attacks' and often leave them there for police to find.
Farouk arrived at Schiphol airport to board a flight to the US with a one way ticket, no luggage and without a passport.
Now usually this ridiculous narrative would immediately have spelled a guaranteed premature end to his planned attack, but according to Detroit attorney and eyewitness to events at Schiphol Kurt Haskell, Farouk benefited from the help of a sharply dressed Indian man who was able to escort the youngster to the boarding gate where he told the attendant that Farouk had no passport but should be allowed on the flight anyway.
When the sharply dressed man was told that he would have to speak to the security manager, he did so and successfully planted the knicker bomber on the plane.
Case closed...
Regarding the 7/7 bombings in London 2005, there exists no CCTV footage of any of the alleged bombers boarding their respective Tube trains.
For one of the most CCTV-rich areas of the planet with over 6,000 CCTV cameras covering the Tube network in 2005, this seems highly unlikely.
No credible explanation has ever been given for the lack of disclosure of any of the CCTV evidence that would conclusively prove the official report of the London bombings.
The London CCTV jungle environment would easily reveal the identity of the alleged perpetrators.
It should have yielded thousands of images showing the movements of the four men and yet, only three unusable still-images, purporting to be CCTV stills from July 7th, have ever been released into the public domain.
We were told by the Israeli company that provides the CCTV camera system, the Verint Systems, that the cameras 'weren't working'. Yeah, right...
Apparently Verint systems is run by the same kind of amateurs like those in ICTS. The camera on the number 30 Stagecoach bus that exploded in Tavistock Square 'wasn't working' either.
The security system for London's buses was provided by, believe it or not, ICTS International.
To make matters even more suspicious, a week after the event a Stagecoach employee claimed that the bus had been 'inspected' for 20 hours over the previous weekend.
If we take the long Israeli history of false flag terror into account and analyze their miserable performance in offering security during today's "muslim terror" events we can come to the conclusion that their complicity is blatant and obvious.
And to give the main architects of false flag terror the responsibility over security is like making a pyromaniac chief of the town's fire department.
It's bullshit and we know it...
In December 2001, ICTS somehow managed to let deranged shoe bomber Richard Reid onto his Miami-bound flight in Paris, and this was after ICTS had earlier cleared Reid through security at Amsterdam airport on a flight to Tel Aviv in July 2001 for what was apparently an all-expenses-paid week-long trip to the Israeli city.
What precisely he did there remains a mystery.
Reid later said that ICTS/El Al had failed to detect that he had explosives in his shoes on the flight to Tel Aviv, an amazing revelation considering the Israeli airline's tight security and the remarkable fact that, six months later, they were again responsible for letting him board the Miami-bound flight with the very same type of 'shoe bomb'.
Israel had not informed British, American, or any other security agency with their concerns about Reid. Why would that be?
Reid's aunt, Claudette Lewis who raised Reid in south London, was quoted as saying she believed her nephew had been "brainwashed". Obviously, the perfect patsy.
This patsy supposedly trained in an Afghanistan terrorist camp and was then believed to have attended an anti-American religious training in Lahore, Pakistan, where he met up with Saajid Badat, another shoe bomber.
Badat told the jury during his trial how he met directly with Osama Bin Laden while planning shoe-bomb plot. What a joke, and a bad one.
What more to say?
The fingerprints of ICTS and other Israeli security companies are all over the terror place and yet no one of the traitors in the pathetic political arena's dares to ask questions about it, afraid to be called an anti-semite or whatever other pathologic arguments.
Again; silence is treason...
Humanity is under attack, and the elephant in the false flag room is Israel. Call the beast by it's name and start with taking out any Israeli influence over international security as they have proven to fail miserably.
And because of their obvious failing in offering security to humanity, the world has become a much more dangerous place.
For any sane person it is crystal clear that had all of the above incidents be genuine and not "False Flags" the Israeli companies responsible for the security would have been given "the grand order of the boot" a very, very long time ago, and yet they continued to run the security at the most crucial airports in the world.
And because of that treason we give card blanche to the perpetrators of the crimes against humanity and it is waiting for the next terror freak show.
The "more of the same concept" however is fueling the global awakening, and instead of feeding fear in society, the worn out false flag concept is seen as death throes of a dying parasite by the awakening masses.
More and more people don't fall anymore for the fear mongering divide and conquer bullshit instigated by the psychopathic globalists with their worn out pathetic false flag strategies.
Stop watching TV and reading bullshit newspapers and connect with people around you.
The global political awakening is exponentially happening and unstoppable, and they know it.
