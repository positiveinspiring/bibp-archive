In a sign the secret battle for control of Japan has gone badly for the dark
cabal, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was recently caught trying to
board a North Korean submarine with large amounts of high value financial
instruments, according to senior CIA sources.
This operation was stopped by
pentagon white hats who are now carrying out a massive operation to get
control of the entire Chinese periphery, including Japan and Vietnam. The
White Dragon Society, for its part, is waiting for the chaos in the West to
subside before making any moves.
Nakasones attempt to flee Japan came because patriotic elements in the
Japanese military/right-wing/police/yakuza complex now realize his policies
betrayed Japan to two decades of economic stagnation. Nakasone and his
trilateral clique are also being blamed for forcing Japans Health and
Welfare Ministry to allow a cocktail of femizing and sterilizing chemicals
to be mixed into Japans food and drug supply for population control
reasons.
Nakasone was given 400 trillion yen by the dark cabal in the 1980s to
finance a major campaign to derail Japans efforts to threaten US hegemony
and become a super-power in its own right, Japanese military intelligence
sources say.
Nakasone, who is a naturalized North Korean, and his gangsters
lost a recent major night-time series of battles against patriotic forces.
As a part of this battle Nakasones house was surrounded by hostile forces
one recent evening even as US military police were sent to protect Bank of
Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa.
Nakasone is in no danger at present but
has been told he must go along with the new paradigm in Japan.
The Pentagon and CIA are also now engaged in a major battle to counter-act
what they consider to be excessive Chinese influence in Japan. Pentagon
officials are now stationed within the national broadcaster NHK and other
networks to ensure a steady flow of pro-US news, according to officials at
NHK and other Japanese networks.
On the Japanese political front, power broker Ichiro Ozawa is on the
war-path against Prime Minister Naoto Kan.
Ozawa has now decided to avoid
using proxies and will aim to personally become Prime Minister. The Japanese
right-wing will not block the latest Ozawa moves because he has promised to
stop leaning excessively towards China. For his part, Kan, who fears
assassination, has created some insurance files of information, notably
concerning the murder of lawmaker Kouki Ishi, in case anything happens to
him. Despite this, Kan is not expected to remain in office past September.
The US campaign in Japan is part of an effort to extent its influence to all
countries bordering on China. Vietnam is the latest country to agree to
allow a US military presence as insurance against becoming a Chinese colony.
The massive, ongoing war-games involving South Korea and targeting China and
North Korea are another part of this major US push.
Russia and Pakistan, for their part, have refused to go along with this
latest effort and as a result have been targeted with
the HAARP
electro-magnetic weapon complex.
Despite its fearsome appearance, the massive US saber-rattling is mainly a
negotiating tactic aimed at ensuring the best possible deal in the upcoming
US bankruptcy proceedings. The US will be forced to default on its
international obligations by the time of its September 31st fiscal year end.
Even the cool-aid drinking, brainwashed journalists and economists who
believe the corporate medias false reality must be suffering from cognitive
dissonance at this point. The US governments fiscal deficit is so huge now
that even if all countries that have a trade surplus with the US invest
their entire surplus in US government bonds, there will still be an annual
shortfall of about $1 trillion.
This is being made up by
Federal Reserve
Board printing presses but that is only a stop-gap measure. Any rational
analysis even of the cooked data provided by the US corporate government
will reveal the situation to be unsustainable.
That is why a series of meetings is scheduled this week and next to try to
sort out US financial obligations prior to the attempt to launch the
gold-backed Amero.
The issue of exactly who is going to control
the Amero,
however, remains to be resolved and sorting out this issue is expected to
lead to extreme turbulence within the US secret establishment.
China, for its part, realizes that time is on its side and continues to
avoid fancy Western financial products in favor of real commodities, real
estate and other reality based investments. They know that all they have to
do is not allow themselves to be trapped into World War 3 and wait for the
US implosion to take its course.
A senior Asian source says they expect the
situation in the West to deteriorate significantly over the next 12-24
months.
Meanwhile, a decision has been made to force the major
global media
companies to report the truth or else be charged with racketeering,
according to sources in the CIA,
the NSA, the Japanese security police and
the White Dragon Society.
The new phase in the battle to liberate humanity
is now focusing on grabbing control of the global story, away from the
war-mongering, lying cabal.
Truth will prevail.
