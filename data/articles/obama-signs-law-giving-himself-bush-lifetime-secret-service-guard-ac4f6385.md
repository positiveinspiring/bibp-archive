Former presidents have to give up rides on Air
Force One.
But now they don't have to give up being
shadowed by the armed-and-earpieced bodyguards of the Secret Service.
President Barack Obama on Thursday signed
into a law a measure giving him,
George W. Bush and future former presidents and their spouses
lifetime Secret Service protection, the White House announced.
The legislation, crafted by Republican Rep.
Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, rolls back a mid-1990s law that imposed a
10-year limit on Secret Service protection for former presidents. Bush would
have been the first former commander in chief affected.
At the time, lawmakers who supported the measure
said it would save the government millions of dollars. They also argued that
former presidents could hire private security firms (as Richard Nixon did
after he decided to forgo Secret Service protection in 1985).
The bill had sailed through Congress with
bipartisan support - it cleared the House of Representatives by voice vote
in early December, and then it zipped through the Senate unopposed.
The law also provides protection for former
presidents kids until age 16. But protection of a spouse shall terminate
in the event of remarriage.
The Secret Service started protecting presidents
in 1901 after the assassination of William McKinley. In 1965, Congress
passed a law authorizing the agency, which is now a part of the Department
of Homeland Security, to protect former presidents for life.
