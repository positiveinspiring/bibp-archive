# The Hidden Evil - 26

The Satanic Influence
There is a definite Satanic manifestation within this program which is
evident during group stalking, and more generally, by the true sinister
nature of the program, which will be abundantly clear to most after careful
study.
The ongoing life-destroying tactics, accompanied
by repeated messages intended to mock targets, are surely acts perpetrated
by those who are influenced by evil. McKinney found that there is a striking
similarity between the tactics used by this worldwide group and those
reported by people who have been stalked after breaking ties with Satanic
cults.
Dr. Kilde too, noted that "Satanism" is a common theme used by worldwide
Gang Stalking crews. She wrote that group members "get rewarded for their
evil actions," which includes Satanic symbolism such as wearing yellow,
orange, and black colors.
Targets may be stalked by an unusual amount of red vehicles and citizens
dressed in red. These vehicles, which may be red or black, may cut targeted
people off on the road, block them in a parking lot, or perform some other
tactic to reveal their presence. License plates which include the numbers
666, 696, 616, and variations of these are used. Apparently these plates can
be made-to-order directly through the DMV. McKinney wrote of the "use of
modified license plates," which "appears to have been acquired through the
State DMV channels, thus suggesting government/intelligence agency
involvement." Citizens with Satanic apparel such as devil figures on shirts
or other clothes may stalk targets.
The people who are used to convey these messages may not be aware that
they're participating in a Satanic theme. This is not surprising because
most appear to be unaware of the nature of the program in general. There may
be several motivating factors used to gain the complicity of well-meaning
participants. Those with red clothing or vehicles who surround targets may
be told that this is necessary so the target will know that they are part of
the team and will be persuaded to leave the community.
For symbolism that is more overt, such as devils and the number 666,
participants may be told that if a target believes members of the community
are actual Satanists, they'll leave. Although I think the majority are not,
some of these people may be Satanists. Multiple researchers contend that
Satanists usually appear to be religious and are often much respected
members of society. Consider the account of Dr. Peck in his book, People of
the Lie; evil needs to hide, and almost always masks itself as
righteousness.
The reason for the existence of this program as told to the citizen squads,
stores and restaurants is a lie. The role they believe they play is a lie.
Lies are spread about individuals to gain cooperation. So there are lies
within lies. The program is literally, one... big... lie... As demonstrated,
the consistent track record of those likely responsible for this secret
program forms a clear picture of their true nature. I've already
demonstrated the atrocities they have caused. But add to that, the lies,
upon lies, upon lies, upon...
"Lying," wrote Dr. Peck, "is simultaneously one of the symptoms and one of
the causes of evil, one of the blossoms and one of the roots." He says, "The
evil in this world is committed by the spiritual fat cats... by the
Pharisees of our own day." "They are," he announced, "for instance, in my
experience, remarkably greedy people. Thus they are cheap - so cheap that
their 'gifts' may be murderous."
Satanism encompasses the international child sex slave trade, drug
trafficking, human sacrifice, murder, and other crimes. In her book, The New
Satanists, Linda Blood wrote, "Satanism is the fastest growing underground
criminal movement in the world today" and that it is "directly linked to an
exploding number of child abuse cases, Nazism, [and] drug dealing." Linda's
analysis of Satanism harmonizes with the conclusions of other researchers,
such as former Senator John DeCamp, and Ted Gunderson.
She adds, "Satanic crime - in fact, all violent, destructive, and criminal
activity associated with malevolent forms of occultism - exists as part of a
wider criminal continuum and must be understood and recognized within that
context." Linda draws from her personal experience in a Satanic cult known
as the Temple of Set, run by former army intelligence officer and
psychological warfare expert, Dr. Michael Aquino.
Gunderson announced, "The video Conspiracy of Silence documents that
children were flown to Washington D.C... for sex orgies with congressmen and
senators." He contends, "My Finders report documents that the CIA was
involved and... still is involved in an international child-kidnapping ring.
I have filed formal complaints with the FBI concerning this but they refuse
to investigate it." Mainstream publications such as the Los Angeles Times
and the Philadelphia Enquirer showed that the Conspiracy of Silence
documentary was scheduled to air on the Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994,
but before it did all copies were purchased and destroyed. Fortunately an
anonymous person sent Gunderson a copy and it is available at his website,
www.Tedgunderson.com.
But where is this Satanic influence coming from? Once again, if we follow
the trail, we find it leads to the supra-governmental organizations
previously mentioned, which are interlocked with Satanic cults. More
evidence for this will be provided. "Satanists control and dominate the big
corporations... in America," proclaimed Gunderson, and added, they have
"overtaken and now control for the most part all aspects of our commercial
system..." He says there is a "satanic cult... network operating within the
United States, with ties to top level officials - including politicians,
judges, law enforcement, U.S. intelligence agents, and leading professional
business men and women."
He continues to list specific organizations under a Satanic influence such
as:
-
The military
-
Many law enforcement agencies, including
the police
-
Courts
-
The Federal Reserve and Wall Street
-
Education
-
The AHA, APA, AMA, ADA
-
Hospitals and mental institutions
-
The FDA
-
Communications such as internet,
telephone and postal service
-
Transportation such as airlines, trains,
roads/highways
-
Religion, science and research
-
Utilities such as gas, electric, oil
-
The entertainment industry including
movie production, TV, music industry and casinos
-
The mainstream media
-
Most major corporations
This Satanic influence within the controlling
elite organizations filters down into the executive branch and intelligence
agencies.
And from there it extends into state and local
governments. Although there may be other organizations which are Satanic in
nature that influence governments, I've focused on the Bohemian Grove and
The Order of Skull and Bones. The existence of these organizations is
incontrovertible. They are both heavily interlocked with the Think Tanks.
It is only a question of whether or not they are
Satanic in nature and how much influence they have on our society.
The Order of Skull and Bones
Skull & BonesThe existence of The Order is irrefutable. Also called, Skull
and Bones, The Order of Death, The Brotherhood of Death, and The Order of
the Deaths-head. The Order was founded in 1832 by William Huntington Russell
and Alphonso Taft. The first graduating class was in 1833. It was formed
after Russell returned from a trip to Germany before his senior year. It is
said to be an American branch (chapter 322) of a German Masonic/Illuminati
group in Bavaria.(*)
Confirmation of its existence and the fact that its members occupy key
positions in business and politics have appeared in mainstream media. For
instance, during the 2004 presidential candidacy, articles appearing in The
Baltimore Sun, CBS News, The Washington Post, The Guardian, and The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution confirmed that both Kerry and Bush were members.
Kerry and Bush also admitted being members on television during a live
interview on Meet the Press. There have also been books published on The
Order that have received favorable Establishment reviews. Although most of
this mainstream coverage was a whitewash, it did reveal a pattern of members
occupying the executive branch.
New Member PhotoEach year during commencement week 15 juniors receive a
"tap" and are asked "Skull and Bones. Accept or reject?" Most say yes, says
Professor Sutton, author of Americas Secret Establishment. After initiation
the "patriarchs" spend only one year at Yale, and upon graduation, they
reportedly receive $15,000 and a grandfather clock. "The organization,"
states Professor Sutton "is oriented to the post graduate outside world."
Members of The Order are elevated to key positions in government. To the
right we see George H. W. Bush standing to the left of the grandfather clock
in this 1947 photo consisting of the 15 new members.
It was legally incorporated as the Russell Trust at Yale University in 1856.
It conducts yearly meetings at Deer Island (sic) in New York, which was
donated in 1906 by a member of The Order, G. Douglas Miller (1870). The core
membership consists of about 20-30 wealthy American families who originally
settled on the East Coast in the 17th century. These families include,
Whitney, Lord, Phelps, Wadsworth, Allen, Bundy, Adams and others. Its
membership also includes families which later acquired wealth, such as
Rockefeller, Sloan, Pillsbury, Davison, Harriman, and Payne.
Skull & Bones TombOn the left is the The Order's tomb at Yale University. An
article appearing in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on March 6th 2004,
entitled Yalies Bush, Kerry Can Keep a Secret, stated, "Bush and Kerry are
only the latest Bonesmen to star on the national stage. President George
Bush, the incumbent's father, was also a member of Skull and Bones..." The
article continued to name other prominent individuals.
Notable members of The Order include:
-
Henry Luce (1920), Time Magazine
-
Henry Lewis Stimson (1888) Secretary of
State, Secretary of War to Truman, recommends Atomic bomb be dropped
on Japan and worked with General Marshall and FDR to allow Pearl
Harbor to occur.(*1)
-
William H. Taft (1878), Supreme Court
Justice and President
-
William F. Buckley Jr. (1950), National
Review
-
Pierre Jay (1892), first chairman of the
Federal Reserve
-
Prescott Sheldon Bush (1917) worked with
W. Averill Harriman to fund Nazis and Communists via Union Banking
Corporation and Guaranty Trust Company
-
Winston Lord (1959) Lord, Day and Lord,
Law Firm
-
William Putnam Bundy (1939) CIA, editor
of CFR's Foreign Affairs magazine, Assistant Secretary of State
-
McGeorge Bundy (1940) National Security
Advisor, President of the Ford Foundation
-
W. Averill Harriman (1913) Director of
Guaranty Trust, Special Assistant to President Truman, funded Nazis
and Communists
-
E. Roland Harriman (1917) Brown
Brothers, Harriman, director of Union Banking Corporation
An examination of these names reveals cross
memberships in the CFR, TC, BB, and the Bohemian Grove.
For instance, William F. Buckley Jr. was a
member of The Order (1950), the Bilderbergers, the Council on Foreign
Relations, and the Bohemian Grove.(*2) "Columnist William F. Buckley is on
the CFR's membership rolls," wrote Professor Marrs. Buckley... is a Skull
and Bones alumni, [and] has also been honored as a participant in the
secretive Bilderbergers Group." In his book, Bohemian Grove: Cult of
Conspiracy, Mike Hanson wrote of The Order, "You will also notice that many
of the names... show up in Bohemian Club member lists." These two
organizations, in turn, are interlocked with the Think Tanks.
George H. W. Bush was a member of The Order (1948), the Council on Foreign
Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and was appointed U.S. Ambassador to
the UN. Perloff acknowledged, "George Bush was a Skull and Bonesman, a
director of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a member of the Trilateral
Commission." He was also the director of the CIA and eventually became
President of the United States. In addition to being a member of The Order,
Professor Marrs concludes that Prescott Sheldon Bush was a founding member
of the Council on Foreign Relations. George W. Bush, was initiated into The
Order (1968), and eventually became president. Both George H. W. Bush, and
George W. Bush have attended the Bohemian Grove.
Winston Lord became the chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations in 1983
and is also a Bilderberger. Professor Marrs wrote that "Winston Lord" of the
"CFR elite is a Skull and Bones man" and is on the "steering committee of
the Bilderbergers." Both Bundy brothers were CFR members and William was
once the director. Henry Lewis Stimson was also a CFR member. E. Roland
Harriman was a CFR member. W. Averill Harriman, who financed Nazis and
Communists, was a member of The Order, and the Council on Foreign Relations.
He also became the U.S. Ambassador to the USSR and Great Britain, as well as
Governor of New York.
In more recent years we find that during the 2004 presidential campaign John
F. Kerry (1966), George W. Bush and Ralph Nader's lawyer, Donald Etra
(1968), were all members of The Order. This was not a coincidence. "The
Order has been called a "stepping stone" to the Council on Foreign
Relations, Bilderbergers, and the Trilateral Commission," wrote author Marrs.
Another example of this is offered by Jim Tucker's analysis of the 1992
election. He wrote "Bush had been a longtime member of the Trilateral
Commission which has interlocking leadership with Bilderberg. Clinton had
been a Trilateralist for seven years and was promoted to the Bilderberg in
1991. Thus the world shadow government owned both presidential candidates in
a typical win-win race."
Of the initiation ritual, Professor Sutton concludes, "Even with our limited
knowledge of the internal ritual of The Order we can make... definite
statements about the links between The Order and satanic beliefs." Within
the ceremony, he says, are "aspects notably satanic." He explains, "The
first link is through photographic evidence of the association of Skull and
Bones with satanic devices, i.e., the skull and crossed bones. The second
link is through satanic symbolism."
"In brief," continues Professor Sutton, "the photographs reveal the men
portrayed as grave robbers who reject human dignity and decency and use
satanic devices." Professor Sutton also notes the activity of "Patriarchs
dressed as skeletons" that "howl and screech at new initiates." A History
Channel documentary entitled, Secret Societies, hosted by Arthur Kent, added
that the shortest senior is appointed "little devil," and wears a Satanic
costume.
Commenting on the bizarre rituals and beliefs of the Order, Professor Sutton
declared, "The reader may consider this juvenile, and it may well be."
However, he adds, "On the other hand, these 'juveniles' are the men today
running the United States." To that, I would add, the planet. Professor
Marrs concurred, writing, "I agree. It is absurd." But, "I can only tell you
that this is exactly what goes on."
Another consideration is whether these initiation rituals are significant
after graduation. Evidence suggests that the answer is yes. Like the
"cremation of care," which will be covered shortly, members of The Order are
pledging their allegiance, not to a country or Jesus Christ as they would
have you believe. The rituals are enacted for the purpose of worshiping a
Satanic entity, and diminishing the conscience of the individuals who
partake in them.
Similar to the Cremation of Care at Bohemian Grove, this diminishing process
is necessary so they can continue to perpetrate heinous acts on citizens of
the world. The "pledge" is essential so that members will never stray from
this one-world movement and the Satanic aspect of it. "It is a psychological
conditioning process," observed Professor Marrs, and "also an intense form
of peer pressure... a type of group training."
As elite and influential as members of this society are, they too are
manipulated and are under a form of mind-control. They are being directed.
Professor Sutton observed, "What happens in the initiation process is
essentially a variation of brain-washing... through heavy peer pressure"
they become "prepared for a life of the exercise of power and a continuation
of this process into future generations." He adds, "The ritual is designed
to mold establishment zombies, to ensure continuation of power in the hands
of a small select group from one generation to another."
"Like their counterparts, the Skull and Bones Society, the Bilderbergers try
to keep what goes on at their meetings hidden from public scrutiny," wrote
Professor Marrs. "These two clandestine organizations... have much to hide
or else their procedures would not be kept behind closed doors. He warned,
"What these cynical and powerful men are doing to damage America, [and] take
away our freedoms... is criminal."
The Order has, says Professor Marrs, "been able to gain impressive positions
of influence in... the Trilateral Commission... and the Council on Foreign
Relations." Later he adds, "They have also been active in places of
leadership for the... foundations - Ford, Rockefeller, Carnegie, Russell
Sage, etc." He explained, "The Order's current lock on the White House,
gives the Brotherhood all the authority it needs to carry out sweeping
changes in the international system of governance."
Professor Sutton also contends that The Order has infiltrated the top of
public organizations such as the church, law, communications, industry,
finance, and politics. For instance, the "American Historical Association,
the American Economic Association, the American Chemical Society, and the
American Psychological Association were all started by members of The Order
or persons close to The Order," stated Professor Sutton. His list also
includes, Education, Law, Politics, Economy, Psychology, Philanthropy,
Medicine, Religion, and Media. He reveals, "These are key associations for
the conditioning of society." Many of these organizations that the
professors speak of were also mentioned by Gunderson.
One way The Order controls these major institutions is through infiltration,
another is by founding them. Professor Sutton explains a phenomenon where
The Order sets up organizations, then fades away. "One observation is that
The Order gets the ball rolling in new organizations, i.e., puts [in] the
FIRST President or Chairman, he explained, "and then, when operations are
rolling along, often just fades out of the picture." Professor Marrs wrote
that The Order has "infiltrated every aspect of society. In four areas in
particular..." He lists these areas as, "American foreign policy," "Wall
Street," "education, and religion."
The Order being first on the scene is evident especially among foundations
and think tanks according to Professor Sutton. Noting specific acts of
infiltration, he writes, the first "President of the Carnegie Institution...
was Daniel Coit Gilman [1852], but other members of The Order have been on
Carnegie boards since the turn of the century." He adds, "Gilman was on the
scene for the founding of the Peabody, Slater, and Russell Sage
Foundations." And that, "McGeorge Bundy was President of the Ford Foundation
from 1966-1979." In 1969, James Jeremiah Wadsworth (1927) formed the Peace
Research Institute, which later merged with the Institute for Policy Studies
(IPS). Andrew Dickson White (1853) was the first president of Cornell
University, and Daniel Coit Gilman was the first president of John Hopkins
University.
There can be no denying that members of The Order are appointed key
positions in government and industry. Now an important question would be:
What are their plans? The activities of The Order are directed towards
bringing about a "New World Order," warned Professor Sutton, which "will be
a planned order with heavily restricted individual freedom, [and] without
Constitutional protection..." He adds, "We deduce this objective by
examining and then summing up the actions of individual members: there has
been a consistent pattern of [this] activity over one hundred years."
Bohemian Grove
The existence of Bohemian Grove is
also incontrovertible. There have been several major sources of grove
information by first-hand experience. Philip Weiss of Spy Magazine
infiltrated the grove in 1989 for about 60 hours. Professor Peter Phillips
of Sonoma State University published information on the grove after he was
invited to the summer encampment of 1994. In 2000 independent filmmaker Alex
Jones and TV Producer and author Mike Hanson infiltrated the grove with a
hidden camera. They produced a film of their experience called, Dark Secrets
Inside Bohemian Grove. In addition, Mike Hanson authored a book called,
Bohemian Grove: Cult of Conspiracy.
Other sources of the club's history include the California Historical
Society, University of California Bancroft Library, the California State
Library, the Bohemian Grove Action Network (BGAN), and a few mainstream
media sources such as The Washington Post, the New York Post, and the
Sacramento Bee. Most of these mainstream publications are sanitized
whitewashes that divert attention from the occult activities which unfold
there. Although I'll be primarily referencing some of the previously
mentioned sources, I'll also include the personal experiences of others who
have been there, as well as some interpretations of grove activities by
people I consider to be experts in history.
Bohemian Grove is the summer retreat of the Bohemian Club of San Francisco.
Mike Hanson wrote, "The Bohemian Grove is more properly known as the
Midsummer Encampment of the Bohemian Club of San Francisco. It takes place
annually each Ides of July in a majestic redwood grove outside Monte Rio,
California..." The Bohemian Club of San Francisco was formed in 1872-3, as
"as a gathering place for newspaper reporters and men of the arts and
literature," wrote Professor Phillips.(*3)
The club is invitation only. According to Hanson and Phillips, although the
club was formed by artists, in the 1880s it was eventually dominated by
business elites. Some early members included, Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce,
Bret Harte, Wytter Bynner, Henry M. Stanley, Jack London, Bing Crosby,
Charlie Chaplin, Will Rogers, and Douglas Fairbanks. Apparently the artists
(men of talent) needed the financing of the industrialists (men of use), and
these businessmen eventually took over the club. It is now a, "good-old-boys
political network," described Hanson.
The Bohemian Club began camping out at various locations in Sonoma County
beginning in 1878. Between 1893 and 1899 they rented Bohemian Grove, and in
1901 purchased about 160 acres. It now consists of about 2,712 acres of
redwood forest. It is located in Sonoma County outside the small town of
Monte Rio, situated along the Russian River, and is about 70 miles north of
San Francisco. At the grove, there is a civic center with a Bar and Grill,
Post Office, and store.
"While the Grove's public areas afford a communal atmosphere for the Grovers
to socialize, the real action goes on in the private confines of the
individual camps," stated Hanson. The Bohemian Grove is equipped with a fire
department and medical care on the premises during the encampment. Wait
staff and other workers must wear ID tags and are restricted to the dining
area and the parking lot.
In the November 1989 issue of Spy Magazine, Philip Weiss wrote in an article
entitled, Inside Bohemian Grove, that "No Trespassing" and "Members and
Guests Only" signs cover the grounds, and guards with binoculars and
infrared sensors watch the paths." Reportedly there are barbed wire fences
surrounding it and helicopters patrol the perimeter during the encampment.
Hanson commented, "The Grove is vigorously guarded during the entire
encampment." The Sonoma County Sheriff's department is said to be the
Bohemian Grove's own private security force. Professor Marrs' research also
leads him to conclude that one of several layer of protection consists of
sheriff's deputies. Compare this to the Bilderbergers, who are escorted by
police and surrounded by SWAT teams during their meetings.
The encampment lasts for about two weeks, and it never rains during their
stay. Lots of alcohol is available 24/7, and the food is apparently
first-class. The average club member's age is reportedly 55. Between two and
three thousand people attend each year. Entertainment includes plays known
as Jinks. The second Saturday of the encampment is referred to as the "Low
Jinks," and the following Friday is the "High Jinks," also known as the
Grove Play. There are apparently also Spring Jinks in June.
Bohemian Grove is basically a playground and policy-making vacation for the
CFR, interlocking Think Tanks, and Tax-exempt Foundations. "The CFR and
Bohemian Club membership lists reflect a lot of the same names," stated
Hanson. "By recent comparison, I was able to count about 40 Bohemians who
are also CFR members." He added, "If you're a member of the Trilateral
Commission or the Council on Foreign Relations, chances are you're a member
of the Bohemian Club, too."
In attendance are representatives of companies such as: Atlantic Richfield,
Avery Dennison Corporation, Colgate-Palmolive, Calfed, CBS Broadcasting,
IBM, Universal/Vivendi Entertainment Group, Mattel Incorporated, Media
General Incorporated, Northrop Corporation, Philip Morris, Pacific
Enterprises, Rockwell International, Sears and Roebuck, SCE Corporation,
Security Pacific, Times Mirror Company, Union Bank, Union Electric Company,
Bechtel Construction, Wells Fargo Bank, Southern California Edison, General
Electric, Bankers Trust, and Bank of America. Former directors of the FBI
and CIA have also attended. As well as representatives from CNN, Los Angeles
Times, Time Warner, and Times Mirror corporation.
Hanson wrote, "Here, heads of state and industry, such as Henry Kissinger,
Caspar Weinberger, James Baker, Dick Cheney, Malcolm Forbes, Stephen Bechtel
and a host of prominent CEOs, foundation chairs and university presidents
mingle... About one-fifth of the members are either directors of one or more
of the Fortune 1000 companies, corporate CEOs, top governmental officials
(current and former) and members of important policy councils or major
foundations." He proclaimed, "99 percent of them are white. And all of them
are very, very rich."
"The remaining members are mostly regional business/legal elites with a
small mix of academics, military officers, artists, or medical doctors,"
added Professor Peter Phillips, in his article, San Francisco Bohemian Club:
Power, Prestige and Globalism, which appeared in the Sonoma County Free
Press on June 8, 2001. "I found at least 150 Bohemians hold nearly 300
directorships in the top 1000 U.S. corporations," said Hanson. "Of these, I
spotted several corporations with more than one Bohemian serving as
directors. These include Bank of America, PG&E, (Pacific Gas and Electric),
AT&T, Ford Motor Company and General Motors."
Notables that have attended the grove include, William F. Buckley Jr.,
George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Walter
Cronkite, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Queen Elizabeth, Leonard Firestone
(Firestone Tires), Henry Ford II, Gerald Ford, Mikhail Gorbachev, Herbert
Hoover, Robert Kennedy, Henry Kissinger, Richard M. Nixon, David Packard
(Hewlett Packard), Prince Philip, Dan Quayle, Ronald Reagan, David
Rockefeller, Laurence Rockefeller, Nelson Rockefeller, Theodore Roosevelt,
Donald Rumsfeld, Helmut Schmidt (former German chancellor), William Howard
Taft, Colin Powell, and Newt Ginrich.
The grove consists of a variety of camps which members are assigned to
depending on their status. Reportedly, at one point the grove had over 200
camps, but now has about 116. The most prestigious camp is Mandalay.
"Mandalay," wrote Hanson, "is the campsite where you'll find Henry
Kissinger, former president Gerald Ford, Nicholas Brady, [and] George P.
Shultz." Some camp names include: Dog House, Isle of Aves, Pink Onion, Oz,
Lands End, Rattlers, Red Fire, Jinks Band, Dragons, and Druids. Former
President Nixon belonged to the Cave Man camp, Reagan was a member of the
Owl's Nest, David Rockefeller belongs to the Stowaway camp, and Art
Linkletter is a member of the Dragons camp.
"The Bushes call the Hill Billies camp home," wrote Hanson, "as did Walter
Cronkite, William F. Buckley Jr. and Christopher Buckley." He continues, "At
Owl's Nest, Reagan camped out with the chairman of American Airlines, while
over at Hill Billies, his vice-president George Bush Sr. was rubbing
shoulders with the president of Eastern Airlines." "Hill Billies," he says,
"also houses directors from General Motors, Southern Pacific, Westinghouse
Electric, B.F. Goodrich, Morgan Guaranty Trust, Mutual Life Insurance,
Metromedia, and Superior Oil."
Hanson asks, "Do the Bohemians really expect us to believe that... cabinet
officials, corporate chieftains and foundation directors... share the same
intimate camp site in the redwoods, and all these gentlemen are going to do
is talk about music and the arts?" "There are few rules," wrote Weiss, "the
most famous one being [the clubs motto] 'Weaving Spiders Come Not Here,' -
in other words, don't do business in the Grove." But, he adds, the "rule is
widely ignored." The club's motto was taken from Act 2 of Shakespeare's, A
Midsummer Night's Dream.
"The media figures attending the retreat all agree not to report on what
goes on inside," stated Extra! Magazine. One example of this media blackout
occurred, "When Dirk Mathison, San Francisco bureau chief for People
Magazine infiltrated the exclusive Bohemian Grove retreat... [and] got a
view into the U.S. elite that very few reporters have glimpsed."
"Unfortunately," they revealed, "that elite includes the management of Time
Warner, the owner of People, which prevented Mathison from telling his
story."
They continued, "In 1982, NPR got a recording of Henry Kissinger's speech at
the Grove - but declined to air it... Also in 1982, a Time reporter went
undercover as a waiter in Bohemian Grove; like Mathison's People article,
his story was killed." Hanson's experience is similar, he said, "After Alex
and I returned from the Grove, Alex went on his radio show and told the
world what we had done. So the next thing you know, we're getting calls from
all these newspapers expressing interest," but "an editor above their heads
would kill it." "Media access to the Grove continues to be limited,"
confirmed The Daily Reveille.
One topic of concern over the years has been the Lakeside Chats, also known
as Lakeside Talks. Like topics covered by the Think Tanks, these topics
become policy regularly. This is policy passed without the voting public's
knowledge or approval. Lakeside Talks begin at 12:30 and last for about 30
minutes. "Arguably, the Lakeside Chats are the most important aspect of what
goes on inside the Grove," wrote Hanson, and added, "matters of public
interest are discussed and perhaps even decided here through the collective
consensus-building process."
In their August 2, 1999 article entitled, Movers, Shakers From Politics,
Business go Bohemian, The Sacramento Bee Correspondent stated, "The club has
drawn criticism for years because of its emphasis on privacy." They added,
"What particularly concerns Phillips and others are the "Lakeside Talks"
held during the summer retreat."
Lakeside ChatOn the left we see both George H. W. and George W. Bush at a
Lakeside Talk during the 2005 encampment. One vocal group that has protested
since 1980 against this type of activity is the Bohemian Grove Action
Network (BGAN), run by Mary Moore. The Sacramento Bee announced, "The point
of the protests, Moore said, has been 'to let the American public know that
what they've learned in civics isn't the full story on how
decision-making... is made in this country.' The Bohemian Club, she said,
'is one of the most elite organizations on the planet.'"
The article continued, "Phillips echoes Moore's objections to the
off-the-record nature of the Lakeside Talks. 'These are extremely powerful
people and private discussions on policy issues that affect us certainly go
against democratic principles. There's no reason that those speeches they're
giving couldn't be transcribed and made public. They have a responsibility
to be open about it.'" Weiss wrote, "The important men come out for the
Lakeside Talks, and each speaker seems to assume that his audience can
actually do something about the issues raised, which, of course, it can."
Apparently the Atomic Bomb was proposed at Bohemian Grove. "Historical
records also clearly tell us that the Manhattan Project [Atomic Bomb] was
planned, instituted and operated out of the Bohemian Grove," stated Hanson.
Regarding the meeting at the Grove's river clubhouse on September 13-14,
1943, he wrote, "Bohemians make no effort to deny that this important
historical moment took place at the Grove; in fact, they rather enjoy
telling the story around the campfire."
He continued, "They publish it in their internal history books with a sense
of pride. In an article entitled, Gay Porn Star Services Bohemian Grove
Members, The New York Post reported on July 22, 2004, "Grovers privately
boast that the Manhattan Project to develop the atom bomb was conceived on
its grounds." Extra! Magazine, stated, "Policy speeches are regularly made
by members and guests, and the club privately boasts that the Manhattan
Project was conceived on its grounds."
"The atom bomb made this particular meeting at the Grove world famous,"
declared Hanson "but it was not an isolated case of business and government
war planning through Bohemian Club facilities." Regarding the 1967
encampment, he wrote, "Nixon and Reagan sat down informally at the Grove to
work a political deal wherein Reagan agreed to run only if Nixon faltered.
Indeed Nixon's campaign was launched from the Bohemian Grove that year by
means of his Lakeside Talk." In a 1989 Lakeside Talk, the plans for the
Stealth B-2 Bomber were considered at the Grove, as well as plans for the
European Union.
Hanson continued, "During the 2000 Grove summer camp, they announced Dick
Cheney as George W. Bush's vice-presidential running mate from Bohemian
Gove. CNN reported in July of 2000 that the decision had been partially made
and that George Bush Jr. had been consulting with George Herbert Walker
Bush... at Bohemian Grove."
"But perhaps the most striking example of the elite Grovers' prior knowledge
of future events," says Hanson, "is a speech given at the 1981 camp by the
late nuclear scientist Dr. Edward Teller." Hanson describes, "In this
Lakeside Talk, he accurately predicted that the United States would go to
war in the Persian Gulf - ten years prior to our first incursion into Iraq."
Other Lakeside Talk topics have included, "World View," "The Recovered
Memory Movement," "Agenda for America," "World Naval Power," "Rogues,
Terrorists [and]... National Security in the Next Century," "Spies and
Terrorists: Confronting the Enemies Within," "Smart Weapons," and "Defining
a New World Order."
Lakeside ChatHere on the right we see former German chancellor Helmut
Schmidt giving a Lakeside Talk in 1991. One can only guess what the results
of these talks have been. These speeches were delivered by Prime ministers,
CEOs, scientists, chancellors, former directors of the CIA and FBI, and a
variety of government officials.
Professor Phillips wrote, "On the surface, the Bohemian Grove is a private
place where global and regional elites meet for fun and enjoyment. Behind
the scene, however, it serves a very important function similar to 18th
century French Monarchy scheming or the 19th century empire building of the
British. The Bohemian Grove is an American version of race, gender and class
elitism. It is the human process of building insider ties, consensual
understandings, and lasting connections in the service of class solidarity.
Ties reinforced at the Grove manifest themselves in global trade meetings,
party politics, campaign financing, and top-down democracy. In a sense, they
live in a self-made Bastille surrounded by power, prestige and privilege,
and united in their fear of grassroots democracy." Hanson adds, "Conspiracy
nuts think the Bohemian Club meets each summer to takeover the world. Get
real. These guys ALREADY run the world."
Owl
"The Owl of Bohemia," is the club's symbol. Some
members reportedly have their homes fraught with owls. "Club members collect
owl statues, figurines, jewelry - anything with an owl on it," stated
Hanson. He described, "You'll see them walking around the Grove wearing polo
shirts embroidered with owls, owl belt buckles, owl bolo tiles, owl
cufflinks, owl rings... The owl is found on all Bohemian materials from
matchbook covers and doormats to the most elaborate Club publications."
Apparently all of this merchandise can be purchased at the Bohemian Grove
gift shop. The individual camps are decorated with wooden or stone owl
statues according to Weiss. Even the 24-hour shuttle service within the
grove is called, "The Owl" shuttle. Pictured right we see the owl on a
napkin taken from a dining area.
During the encampment, a 40-foot stone owl is worshiped in a ceremony called
the Cremation of Care.(*4) The ceremony involves a mock-human sacrifice and
is performed by men with torches dressed in red, black, brown and silver
robes. Some of them have white skeletons painted on their faces. The
ceremony takes place on an altar located at the base of the owl and lasts
for about 15 minutes. Members admit to this ritual and information regarding
it has appeared in mainstream publications. It was also filmed live, by Mike
Hanson and Alex Jones. In fact, the Bohemian Club acknowledged this
infiltration and even viewed the film. In a letter regarding the Cremation
of Care, which was sent to a member of the Jones/Hanson team, they stated,
"it's about as innocent as anything could be."
The New York Post acknowledged this, writing that members, "perform
mock-druidic rituals that revolve around a 40-foot-tall stone owl. In one
ritual, called 'Cremation of Care,' members wearing red-hooded robes cremate
a coffin effigy of 'Dull Care' at the base of the owl altar." "The annual
gathering near the Russian River... starts with the 'Cremation of Care'
ritual," echoed the Sacramento Bee, "in which the club's mascot is burned in
effigy, symbolizing a freedom from care." The Daily Reveille added, "The
ceremony includes Grove members carrying torches and wearing 'hooded
robes.'" So, according to mainstream media, business leaders are performing
mock human sacrifices at the Bohemian Grove.
Speaking from personal experience, Weiss wrote, "The cremation took place at
9:15 p.m... [and they] wore bright red, blue and orange hooded robes...
another priest or two appeared at the base of the main owl shrine, a
40-foot-tall, moss-covered statue of stone." "Built to serve as a ceremonial
site for traditional Bohemian rituals," said Hanson, "the Owl of Bohemia is
used yearly for the Cremation of Care Ceremony." During the ceremony,
Beethoven's 7th symphony is played as well as funeral music.
Also, during the actual sacrifice, there is an auditory effect which is
apparently intended to suggest that the sacrificial object is screaming in
pain. The "Care" that these world leaders sacrifice, is obviously symbolic
of the care or compassion that they must subvert in themselves, in order to
carry out the acts necessary for world domination and the infliction of
suffering that accompanies it. In a radio report entitled, Expose of the
Bohemian Grove, Professor Texe Marrs, a bestselling author, says that the
ceremony would be "silly if it weren't so evil."
Cremation of CareSome believe that this owl represents Moloch, or Molech,
which is a deity in the Old Testament that children were sacrificed to.
Hanson described, "There is no shortage of evidence that the rituals
conducted at Bohemian Grove are derived from the rituals of ancient Babylon,
Sumer, Canaan, Phoenicia, and Carthage." The picture on the right is of the
1990 Cremation of Care ceremony.
He continued, "All the evidence seems to be pointing towards the Bohemian
Grove's ritual being a contemporary manifestation of the ancient Cult of
Isis. Among many other titles, Ishtar was known as 'The Lightbringer,'
'Light of the World,' 'Exalted Light of Heaven,' and 'Torch of Heaven and
Earth.' Ishtar is also known as Venus, and many theologians see Ishtar as
the female counterpart of Lucifer, who is also referred to as 'the
Lightbringer.'" He concludes, "In the final analysis, the Great Owl of
Bohemia symbolized the Cult of Isis, by symbolizing all four if its gods:
Ishtar, Lucifer, and by virtue of the associated flames representing
abandonment to Lucifer... Satan."
During the ceremony, Jones and Hanson were surrounded by men groaning with
sexual delight, saying, "Do it, do it," and "burn him, burn him." Both Jones
and Hanson were sickened by the ritual. There was a feeling of disgust they
felt that even the documentary, which they would later produce, could not
express. Some of us have been in a similar situation, perhaps in the
presence of another, where we could literally feel the evil emanating from
their presence, which caused us to feel disgusted.
Dr Peck described, "Revulsion is a powerful emotion that causes us to
immediately want to avoid, to escape, the revolting presence. And that is
exactly the most appropriate thing for a healthy person to do under ordinary
circumstances when confronted with an evil presence." "It's just really sick
to be inside there," described Jones, and added, "words can't describe the
evil that was in there." Jones sums up his description of the Bohemian Grove
as, "a nightmarish, hellish place that I would expect Satan to reside in."
It is a, "sick" place where members "carry out a Satanic ritual," added
Professor Marrs.
Like its interrelated Think Tanks, Bohemian Grove appears to be directed by
an inner-core, which most members may not be aware of. There have been
rumors circulating for years that pedophilia, murder, rape and real human
sacrifices have taken place at Bohemian Grove. If it is an established fact
that these mock human sacrifices take place, and mainstream media has
acknowledged this, then how far of a leap is it for some of these
inner-circle members to perform real sacrifices?
Hanson and Jones had some occult experts analyze their footage of the
Cremation of Care, and they concluded that what they witnessed was an outer
sanctum of a cult that exists without the knowledge of most members. "In
more recent years," proclaimed Hanson, "troubling new information has come
to light in the testimony of CIA Mind Control survivors involving sexual
abuse they suffered at the Bohemian Grove."
Former Senator John DeCamp stated that one of his clients spoke of an area
later identified as Bohemian Grove, where his client was forced to witness
and engage in Satanic activity. DeCamp wrote, "Paul [Bonacci] was taken by
Larry King [no relation to the media personality] and others to a wooded
area in California - identified after publication [of The Franklin Cover-up]
as Bohemian Grove. There Paul and another boy were forced to... [participate
in unspeakable acts]." Apparently Boystown was used as a recruitment ground
for young boys to be flown to Bohemian Grove and Washington to service
wealthy pedophiles in positions of political influence.
Referring to this matter Professor Marrs said that these wealthy individuals
were caught, "picking them up and flying them out to the Bohemian Grove
where these orphans, evidently, were servicing these monsters." The
professor continued, "He [Bonacci] was taken to... the Bohemian Grove in
California," and was "forced to do sex acts with other children in front of
these wealthy perverts." DeCamp attested that, a snuff pornography film was
made of these events. And Bonacci stated that the "men with the hoods"
disposed of a murdered child dropped out of a helicopter over a wooded area.
Hanson commented, "Paul Bonacci was an eyewitness to the ritual rape and
murder of a young boy at the bohemian Grove in the summer of 1984... [while]
being forced to participate (at gunpoint) in a homosexual snuff film..." He
added, "No teenage boy could possibly know these intimate details about the
Grove unless he had actually been there. Even more, Bonacci had never even
heard of the Bohemian Grove at the time he was taken there to 'entertain'
the Bohos years ago."
Professor Marrs agreed, "He [Paul Bonacci] was forced to witness and
participate in Satanic cult murder." He added, "Now think about this, why
would he even know about such a place?" Interestingly, homosexual activity
is known to take place at Bohemian Grove. Male and female prostitutes are
often hired during the encampment.
"In the fall of 1992," proclaimed Hanson, "Paul was shown a black and white
photo of the Grove's moss covered owl statue and quickly identified it as
the site of the July 1984 snuff film described in DeCamp's book. This is not
a game or the fanciful imaginings of a child. This is the cold-blooded
ritual murder of a human being!" DeCamp added, "Understand that I didn't
know that this place he describes was Bohemian Grove back then, nor did the
kid when he was writing it."
Speaking of just one of the many sudden deaths that occurred surrounding
this investigation, Jones stated, "The senator was hired by the republicans
to disprove these stories, [but] he found out it was true. Then his
investigator had his plane blow up, right after he called him [DeCamp] and
said I'm flying out to Chicago... I've got the goods on these people." The
investigator and his son were killed.
Another person with first-hand experience of grove activities is Cathy
O'Brien. Hanson comments on O'Brien's account of the grove, writing,
"O'Brien writes of her visits to the Bohemian Grove, [which were] secretly
approved by top insiders. Her programmed mission was to take part in porn
films shot at the Grove, and to entertain in the various secret live sex
rooms located within the massive property." She says she was often
prostituted to various government leaders which was covertly filmed for
blackmail purposes.
In her documented autobiography, Trance Formation of America, former
government mind-control victim Cathy O'Brien writes, "Bohemian Grove is
reportedly intended to be used recreationally, providing a supposedly secure
environment for politically affluent individuals to 'party' without
restraint." O'Brien was apparently used by the CIA at the Bohemian Grove to
compromise politicians. "My knowledge of these cameras," she describes, "was
due to the strategically compromising positions of the political
perpetrators I was prostituted to in the various kinky theme rooms."
Apparently, for the inner-core members, the grove is equipped with several,
"perversion theme rooms," which include necrophilia, group orgy rooms, and
others too graphic to mention.
She continues, "Slaves of advancing age or with failing programming were
sacrificially murdered 'at random' in the wooded grounds of Bohemian Grove."
"Rituals were held at a giant, concrete owl monument," where "I witnessed
the sacrificial death of a young, dark-haired victim." She adds, "no
memory... is as horrifying as the conversations overheard... pertaining to
implementing the New World Order." "The solution being debated," she
describes, "was not pollution/population control, but mass genocide of
'selected undesirables.'"(*5)
"Even more difficult to ignore," wrote Hanson, "is the fact that Bonacci's
tale jives with that of Cathy O'Brien, who was forced to participate in a
similar snuff film where she witnessed the murder of another young woman at
the Grove. Paul Bonacci and Cathy O'Brien have never met... yet they tell
nearly the same story" but "no official investigation has been done..." The
grove consists of over 2,700 acres of redwood forest. It would not be
difficult to conceal an actual murder. Hanson wrote, "A lot of the people
who work at the Grove don't even get to go over to where the Owl is. That's
a whole separate part from where they work and they are confined to a
certain area. We talked to some Grove employees who don't even know that the
owl statue is there."
For the most part, it's common knowledge that human sacrifices happened in
ancient times. These sacrifices were apparently conducted by the financial
elites of those periods. Even if these are only mock human sacrifices, at
the very least, the people involved are still performing the rituals
symbolic of the subversion of their conscience. Dr. Peck noted, "Those who
are evil" exhibit a "brand of narcissism so total that they seem to lack, in
whole or in part, this capacity for empathy."
So, if one of the major steps on the path to evil is the removal of
compassion, or care. And if it is an established fact that world leaders are
emulating this removal of care for humanity by sacrificing it, then this is
a serious problem. However, I tend to believe that much worse things go on
at the grove, because I've concluded that the people who run this planet are
definitely monsters.
Other than engaging in occult rituals and planning policy without the
public's approval, what's the purpose of the grove? O'Brien writes, "My
perception is that the Bohemian Grove serves those ushering in the New World
Order."
Former FBI Senior Special Agent Ted L. Gunderson has 27 years experience
investigating Satanic cults. In his report, Techniques Used To Silence
Critics, he sums up the Bohemian Grove as a "Satanic Cult" which is
"actively practicing behind the scenes... to insure the passage of
regressive legislation that takes away many of our Constitutional rights
contained in the Bill of Rights." He says this legislation includes,
"Homeland Security and the USA Patriot Act." Gunderson's claim that these
major decisions were made at the grove is consistent with what has already
been admitted in mainstream news. He also concludes that these Satanists
control all of the major Federal Government regulatory agencies.
Run by Satanists
According to this information, the
planet is essentially controlled by wealthy Satanists. Author Perloff wrote,
"Many centuries ago, the Hebrew Old Testament... and the Christian New
Testament... warned of an evil, one-world government." He explained "Many
notables of the American Establishment have given themselves over to one
side in this conflict, and it is not the side the ancient scriptures
recommend."
On her Road to Freedom Show , which covered the topic of Satanism and
organized stalking, Eleanor White proclaimed that the upper level of this
international stalking group is Satanic in nature. "In my view," she says,
"nothing else could account for such merciless destruction of innocent
peoples' lives." Now that we understand that Satanic cults composed of world
leaders exist, this becomes perfectly logical.
Unsurprisingly, the FBI's Project Megiddo "educated," law enforcement, by
warning them of paranoid extremists, who believe they are being persecuted
by the Satanic U.S. government. "Almost uniformly, the belief among
right-wing religious extremists is that the federal government is an arm of
Satan," they say. "By extension," they add, "the FBI is viewed as acting on
Satan's behalf."
"I proudly served in the FBI for more than 27 years," countered Gunderson,
"and realize that there are thousands of loyal, honest and dedicated
citizens in all branches of the government, including the FBI, the CIA and
other intelligence agencies. However, it is apparent that upper level
management in the FBI and CIA and other intelligence agencies are under the
control of... satanists." Gunderson says there is an active disinformation
program launched by the U.S. Government to discredit those who speak out
against these wealthy Satanists.
Summary
People who essentially run the planet, have openly declared that they engage
in occult rituals, which multiple reliable sources conclude to be Satanic in
nature. These rituals include the sacrifice of compassion, and oaths of
obedience which are pledged to a cause. The evidence suggests that these
rituals are symbolic pledges to carry out a political agenda known as the
New World Order.
Elite Satanic cults, the drug trafficking trade, and the international child
sex-slave business are interconnected, according to these researchers. To
this I would add, the Hidden Evil. These researchers contend that this is a
multi-billion-dollar worldwide enterprise. The fragments that occasionally
appear in mainstream media are merely a tiny fraction of an undercurrent of
interconnected programs, which are part of Satanism. The occasional media
pieces are diffused by federal law enforcement which botch investigations,
and by official "experts" who assist with cover-ups by discrediting
witnesses.
The documentation presented portrays a heavy cross membership between the
elite Think Tanks and Satanic cults. All of these groups work in concert to
essentially control the planet. The evidence provided also indicates that
this Satanic thread runs from the top-down, and encompasses a network of
highly organized crime. This influence runs from the supra-governmental
organizations down into the executive branch, and federal level. From there,
it extends down to state and local governments where it manifests as the
Hidden Evil.
Citizens on the lower level, who participate in stalking targeted people,
are mostly not aware that their seemingly helpful group is one small
component of a larger, very malicious structure. If they were to follow this
command structure upward, they would most assuredly find that it meets at a
hub, where other destructive activities originate. The Hidden Evil exists as
an offshoot alongside other activities at the highest levels, emanating
basically, from Satanism.
