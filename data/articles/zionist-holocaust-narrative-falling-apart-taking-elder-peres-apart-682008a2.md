Truth must be said, I do admire fierce President Ahmadinejad almost
as much as I despise war criminal Shimon Peres.
However, reading the rant Peres gave Wednesday during the UN's General
Assembly is a rather amusing experience. The man who has more blood on his
hands than any living Israeli politician was rather daring.
"The Iranian people are not our enemies,"
declares Peres. This is a pretty interesting statement, bearing in mind
that Israeli Minister Mofaz threatens to nuke Iran on a daily basis.
"Their leader (Ahmadinejad) is a danger to his people, the region and
the world."
Again, a very bold statement considering the
established statistical fact that the vast majority of Europeans actually
see Israel and the USA as the leading threat to world peace.
But Peres wouldn't stop just there, following the tradition of the Jewish
Marxists who always know better than anyone else what is good for the world
proletariat, the Palestinians and so on, Peres, the Yiddishe Mullah knows
what Islam is all about:
"He (Ahmadinejad) is a disgrace to the
ancient Iranian people. He is a disgrace to the values of Islam."
But it isn't just Islam's values Peres
specializes in. He also knows better than the assembly of nations what is
good and what is bad. Seemingly Peres must be convinced that Judification of
the entire world is completed.
This allows him to decide what the UN is all
about and who should be allowed to speak on its platform.
"He (Ahmadinejad) is a disgrace to this very
house, the United Nations, its basic principles and values. His
appearance here is already a shame."
Whether Peres was himself successful in
addressing the nations is a question that will be left to historians and
analysts, however, he himself wasn't totally convinced by his own shallow
arguments. Thus he ended up employing the most tedious overused Hasbara
propaganda. The pathetic repetition of the "Elders of Zion" tale is one
example.
Shimon, let me advise you, you had better keep quiet about this 'Elder'
topic at least momentarily. You see, in crumbling America, a super power
that was toppled by policies set by Wolfowitzes and Greenspans, the Elders
of Zion is a devastating reality. You really do not want to go there, you
really do not want to be the one who brings it up.
However, Shimon, just to remind you that amongst your own countless
disastrous fatal personal failures was the Oslo Accord. It was you who
coined the zio-centric idiom 'New Middle East' with the Jewish state as its
'financial capital'. Let me tell you Shimon, this 'dream' of yours qualifies
you as the epitome of the Zionist Elder.
However, the Elders of Zion is just one Zionist weapon, once it is brushed
aside.
The last Zionist weapon of mind destruction is there to be launched,
the Shoah and its denial:
"Their despicable denial of
the holocaust is
a mockery of indisputable evidence, a cynical offense to survivors of
the horror. Contradictory to the resolutions adopted by this assembly."
Listen to me carefully president Shimon, we
better admit it, the Zionist Holocaust narrative is falling apart and you
have only yourself to blame. For the last 60 years, you and your people have
been killing Palestinians in the name of Jewish suffering.
Consequently, Israelis are regarded by many as the 'Nazis of our time'. In
other words, your present sinister ugliness is far more concerning for all
of us than the Nazi crimes that happened 65 years ago. Differently than any
other historical event, the Holocaust is a closed book for research, with
its crimes that we are not even allowed to scrutinize properly, due to
strict laws about what can an cannot be researched or even uttered.
However, in order to maintain the Holocaust Zionist narrative untouched, a
strong dollar maintained by 'friendly' bankers is needed. Unfortunately, as
you may realize, the dollar is not doing very well at the moment and your
'friendly' bankers are about to be subject to a federal investigation. If I
were you Shimon, I would ask my Hasbara guys to come up with something
slightly better than the old Holocaust to distract everyone from reality.
At a certain stage in his speech, Elder Zionist Peres becomes either a stand
up comedian or senile, I just cannot make up my mind yet.
"Iran," he says "continues to develop
enriched uranium and long range missiles. They introduce a religion of
fear, opposing the call of the Lord in respect of life."
Shima'le, look in our eyes when you say it,
wasn't it you yourself who launched the Israeli nuclear project? Wasn't it
you who introduced the entire region to the nuclear threat? Shima'le you are
no doubt a disgrace to human intelligence. No wonder the Israelis themselves
never voted for you in your entire political career.
However, once you start to spread Israeli Hasbara lies, no one can really
stop you:
"Iranian support for Hezbullah divided
Lebanon. Its support for Hamas split the Palestinians and postpones the
establishment of the Palestinian State."
I was always sure that Israel loves to see the
Arabs divided, was I wrong?
And if Iran indeed divides Lebanon and the
Palestinians you should really support Iran, am I wrong again? You are
obviously lying. Being an Elder Zionist you stand in front of the nation and
fib. You know that neither the Lebanese nor the Palestinians are divided.
You know very well that the Hamas and the Hezbullah is the new spirit of
Islam.
May I advise you, Mr Israeli president: We all support the Hezbullah
especially when they crushed your 'mighty' army.
We all support the
democratically elected Hamas. As the truth of Zionism unveils itself, we all
come to know who are the enemies of peace. May I suggest to you one more
thing. You should never be worried about the Palestinian people being split.
As split as they may look, they are far from being divided.
They all see the victory at the end of the dark
Zionist tunnel.
