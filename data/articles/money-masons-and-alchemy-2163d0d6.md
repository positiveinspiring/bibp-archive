Today I'd like to talk about money.
I'm afraid I have come upon dire times and am in
need of funds if I am to continue this video series. If any of you princely
subscribers out there feel enough generosity your heart, I would be forever
grateful if you could spare me a dollar or fifty. I accept cash, checks,
money orders and paypal.

You won't find anyone asking for a handout here.
I ain't
George Bush, Senior and
Bill Clinton
giving their puppy dog routine, and I ain't any of these dubious "feed the
children" predators who play the guilt card on the gullible and overly
selfless. These charities are nothing more than another scam the government
and other entities use to further deplete the bank accounts of the already
financially-stressed.
Due the math - when 90% of the American
population controls just 15% of the wealth, what economical sense does it
make that the common citizen should foot the bill for the charities? Next
time a charity turns on the violin music with you, I suggest you tell them
to go bum the remaining 10%, whose pocket change could feed more mouths than
the combined donations of a million average Joes.
Tell them you are already
donating to the needy - yourself.
Now, if only that were tax deductible...
Speaking of money and taxes, I thought I should cover the darker and more
arcane aspects of that all-powerful philosophical illusion we call currency.
Not so much its economical function in the world, but the meaning behind it
and its symbols.
Perhaps some of you are familiar with the phrase, "Coin of the realm." It's
a seemingly mundane enough expression until you take note that the word
"realm" is derived from the word "reality". In turn, "reality" is derived
from the word "real", meaning royalty.
In its original sense, this literally
meant that the ruler is the source of reality for his kingdom, and that he
has the power to dictate and alter that reality.
Considering money has bore the image of monarchs
and political leaders since the advent of coins as monetary tokens, the
image can be interpreted as a reminder that the ruler validates the reality
and controls the value of that fiat currency. This plays into ancient
alchemical concepts of magic - making something from nothing; i.e., creating
a system of trade out of something that is otherwise a worthless object or
data.
That brings us to the fact that most of
America's founding fathers were
Masons or close associates of Masons, a
secret society with a rich alchemical tradition. Though their motives are
debatable, it is likely they translated these ideas and philosophies into
the system of money we use to this day.
Although it is denied/unacknowledged by most, it
is an indisputable fact that federal American architecture and icons are
rife with Masonic - and thus alchemic - symbols. This is never more true
than in monetary script. First of all the, the dollar sign itself is very
similar to the alchemical symbol for Mercury [see video example], as well as
the Staff of Mercury/Hermes,
the Caduceus.
The Caduceus - originally representative of the
Serpent coiled around the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden - is a
common symbol in the medical world, its symbolic roots in alchemical
transformation and healing.
A symbol of the
American goddess Columbia
holding a Caduceus also appears, interestingly enough, on the side of the
Federal Reserve building.

Perhaps the 20th Century's most famous Mason, American President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, is not only responsible for the Masonic-laden
design of the modern dollar bill, but annexed the gold standard as well,
essentially turning the US economy into a tenuous, almost "magical", idea.
Part 2
Now, if you have $1 bill handy (not
sure if that is possible with current gas prices) you may want to refer to
it while I point out some of its many Masonic/Alchemic symbols.
On the reverse side of the dollar bill, you will
find
the Great Seal of the United states, an eagle clutching an olive branch
in its right claws, a bunch of arrows in its left. If you count them, there
are 13 of each, as well as 13 stars in the symbol above the eagle's head.
Though many claim the recurrence of 13 represents the original 13 American
colonies, it is interesting to note that 13 is a number highly significant
to both Masons and alchemists.
Denominations of 13 appear several other times
on the dollar bill (13 times on the back of the dollar bill, in fact),
including in the image of the reverse side of the Great Seal - there are 13
layers of the pyramid beneath the eye capstone.
Even more compelling, if you take the triangle
shape of the pyramid, turn it upside down and superimpose it on the pyramid
(you can do this with a pen or pencil), it forms a six-sided star, the
recognizable
Star of David symbol (Jewish cabbalism is tied closely with
alchemy).
Now, look at the letters adjacent to each point
(excluding the pyramid cap part) of the star. They spell the word "mason".
Coincidence? I don't think so. Now, on the front of the bill, in the upper
right corner - this will take a magnifying glass - you may notice what
appears to be an owl perched on the concave part of the upper left corner of
the crest.
Owls traditionally represent vigilance and
hidden knowledge. Last but not least, the phrase "In God We Trust" is in
fact a Masonic motto.
Even with all the cryptic symbols and occultic secrets, this still seems
innocuous enough, right? Perhaps. But it must be noted that some historical
accounts link the Masonic forerunners, the Knights Templar, to worshiping a
severed head representative of Baphomet (possibly a horned demon or Satan
himself).
This may merely be anti-Templar propaganda of
the time, but it is interesting that the number 13 is also associated with
Baphomet. Another symbol for Baphomet, the skull and bones, is a mutual
symbol for Yale's infamous "Order of Death" secret society.
However, this
could be a coincidence, as the skull and bones is a common, archetypal symbol.
One thing that is highly curious, is the
striking similarity between the pose of a popular illustration of Baphomet
and a statue of George Washington [see video example].
One other satanic/alchemical connection to all of this, is a subplot found
in [Johann] Wolfgang von Goethe's classic "Faust". In the story, the
Devil gains the favor of the king by revealing to him the alchemical
secret of the "Philosopher's Stone".
The secret?
How to control the masses by making
them believe in the illusion of printed paper money.
