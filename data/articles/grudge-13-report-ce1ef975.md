Opening subject page consisted
of a report of the findings as written by Lt. Col. Friend
and his analysis.
Must stress at this point that the
version seen was annotated. There were inserts that were added
to this copy after it had been initially printed. Sections
remembered very vividly are the photographs and the reports
concerning captive sights of various UFOs to include Mexico,
Sweden, United States. and Canada. There were also what was then
classified Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind. It was made very
clear that these people whom it was determined had genuine CE
3s were moved in the middle of the night by Air Force personnel
and relocated to various sites in the Midwest and northwest
parts of the United States. In many cases these people
experienced physical ailments from exposure to various types of
radiation.
One case especially noted and remembered very vividly was
entitled Darlington Farm Case' out of Ohio. Case apparently
took place in October 1953. Man, wife and 13 year old son were
sitting down at dinner table. As they sat there the lights in
the farm house began to dim. Dogs and animals raised ruckus
outside. 13 year old boy got up from dinner table to see what
was going on. Called his mother and father to come look at the
funny light in the sky. Father and mother got up and as they got
up the son went outside into the yard. Father and mother went
out onto the porch.
When they got out on the porch one
of the dogs broke loose from leash beside house and came running
around front. Boy began chasing it out into the open field. As
mother and father watched the light cam down from the sky. They
described it as a round ball of fire and it began to, hover over
field where boy and dog had run to. As they stood and watched,
the mother and father heard the boy start screaming for help
whereupon the father grabbed his shotgun which was right next to
the door and began to run out into the field with the mother
following. When the father got to the field he saw his son being
carried away by what looked like little men, into this huge
fiery looking object.
As it took off the father fired
several rounds at the object, to no avail. They found dog, its
head was crushed but no sign of boy or any other footprints of
the little men who apparently carried him off. Father
immediately called Darlington police and they immediately came
out to investigate. The official report read that the boy had
run off and was lost in the forest which bordered the farm.
Within 48 hours the Air Force made the determination that the
family was to be relocated and the mother and father were picked
up by Air Force Intelligence and all personal belongings and
possessions were loaded into U.S. Air Force trucks and moved to
a northwestern relocation site.
The mother was in shock and had to go through a great deal of
psychotherapy and deprogramming as did father. One Interesting
aspect about this case was classification under the Air Force
report which read it was a genuine CE 3 and that for the good of
the national security the mother and father had been relocated
to re-location zones Z21-14. Not sure whether this indicated map
grid coordinates or latitude longitude.
According to the report there were
at least 4 relocation sites across the United States. Depending
upon which type of encounter these people had, the report
Indicated that there were extensive medical facilities available
at these relocation sites to deal with all medical emergencies
up to an including radiation poisoning. The report mentioned a
site located in the Utah-Nevada area, but no indication of Its
purpose or what it was for.
Report gave clear Indication of reports of human mutilations,
most notably was a case witnessed by Air Force personnel in
which an Air Force Sgt. EE-6 by the name of Jonathon P. Lovette
was observed being taken captive aboard what appeared to be a
UFO at the White Sands Missile Test Range In New Mexico. This
abduction took place in March of 1956 at about 0300 local and
was witnessed by Major William Cunningham of the United States
Air Force Missile Test Command near Holloman Air Force Base.
Major Cunningham and Sgt. Lovette were out in a field downrange
from the launch sites looking for debris from a missile test
when Sgt. Lovette went over the ridge of a small sand dune and
was out of sight for a time. Major Cunningham heard Sgt. Lovette
scream in what was described as terror or agony. The major,
thinking the Sgt. had been bitten by a snake or something ran
over the crest of the dune and saw Sgt. Lovette being dragged
into what appeared to him and was described as being a silvery
disk like object which hovered in the air approximately 15 to 20
feet.
Major Cunningham described what
appeared to be a long snake-like object which was wrapped around
the sergeants legs and was dragging him to the craft. Major
Cunningham admittedly froze as the sergeant was dragged inside
the disc and observed the disc going up into the sky very
quickly. Major Cunningham got on the Jeep radio and reported the
incident to Missile Control whereupon Missile Control confirmed
a radar sighting. Search parties went out Into the field looking
for Sgt. Lovette. Major Cunningham's report was taken and he was
admitted to the White Sands Base Dispensary for observation.
The search for Sgt. Lovette was continued for 3 days at the end
of which his nude body was found approximately 10 miles
downrange. The body had been mutilated; the tongue had been
removed from lower portion of the Jaw. An incision had been made
Just under the tip of the chin and extended all the way back to
the esophagus and larynx. He had been emasculated and his eyes
had been removed. Also, his anus had been removed and there were
comments in the report on the apparent surgical skill of the
removal of these items including the genitalia.
The report commented that the anus
and genitalia had been removed as though a plug which In the
case of the anus extended all the way up to the colon. There was
no sign of blood within the system. The initial autopsy report
confirmed that the system had been completely drained of blood
and that there was no vascular collapse due to death by
bleeding.
Sub comment was added that this was
unusual because anybody who dies or has complete loss of blood
there is vascular collapse. Also noted was that when the body
was found there were a number of dead predatory type birds
within the area who apparently had died after trying to partake
of the sergeant body. There were a number of extremely grisly
black and white photos. From all indications the body had been
exposed to the elements for at least a day or two. The New
Mexico sun in the desert is extremely hot and debilitating under
normal circumstances.
In this section of the report it also indicated that there were
numerous occasions in which a UFO tracked alongside of a fired
missile and on one occasion said missile was observed being
taken aboard a UFO while in flight. The speeds indicated were
absolutely phenomenal.
(Englishs father had told him privately
that on more than one occasion he had personally tracked what
they termed as foo fighters. English' father was an electronic
engineer by profession and was fairly well versed on electronics
engineering and design and on more than one occasion he was
involved in telemetry programming of missies. Englishs father
is currently a state legislator in Arizona.)
The report also indicated that there were a number of recovery
teams that were activated specifically for the purpose of
recovering any and all evidence of UFOs and UFO sightings. Most
notably recorded in publication was what they called Recovery
Team Alpha. It was reported that Alpha had been extremely active
in a number of area and on certain occasions had traveled
outside of the continental United States. Alpha was based out of
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and was on the move constantly.
Further information in the report consisted of such things as
reported sightings and where air force planes had been destroyed
or had combat encounters or had been attacked by UFOs. Also
there were autopsy reports of various human mutilations.
About midway through the report came a section which dealt
specifically with photographs. Each photo was labeled and
appendixed to certain reports. A number of photos in there dealt
with a recovery program of some type that took place in the
southwestern part of the United States. They did not give a
location name but they did give grid coordinates for that area.
There is no clear indication to exactly where it was. The photos
dealt with special teams that were called in to recover a
crashed UFO. It also dealt with alien bodies and autopsy
reports, autopsy type photographs, high quality, color, 8x10,
5x7.
Photo number 1 showed an alien being on an autopsy table which
is a metal table with runnels and traps underneath to trap fluid
and feces. Body appeared to be a little short of 4 feet. Table
was about 7 foot. No clothing on body, no genitalia, body
completely heterous, head was rounded cranium, slightly
enlarged, eyes almond shaped, slits where nose would be,
extremely small mouth, receding chin line, holes where ears
would be.
Photo was taken at angle, side view,
looking at body from 45° elevation, left hand was .visible, head
was facing to left, body was right to left position (head on
right, feet on left), eyes were closed appeared oriental-looking
and almond shaped, left hand slight longer than normal, wrist
coming down Just about 2 to 3 Inches above the knees. Wrists
appeared to be articulated In a fashion that allowed a double
Joint with 3 digit fingers. Wrist was very slender. There was no
thumb. A palm was almost non-existent. The three fingers were
direct extension from the wrist.
Color of the skin was bluish gray, dark bluish gray. At base of
the body there was a darker color, Indicating body was dead for
some time. Body fluid or blood had settled to base of body. This
indicated that body had been examined before beginning autopsy.
Picture showed beginning stages of autopsy, following standard
procedure, body was slit from crotch to Just under chin and
green viscous liquid was in evidence. There were internal organs
but these could not be identified. Photos thereafter concerned
specific areas of Internal organs of what appeared as small
cluster of a multi-valve heart or at least 2 hearts within the
cadaver.
No accurate description of autopsy report or what was
found within corpse accompanying photos. Indication that there
was no stomach or digestive track per se. Later analysis showed
that fluid within body was chlorophyll-based liquid which
apparently dealt with photosynthesis or similar process. The
report theorized that nourishment was taken in through mouth,
however since there is no digestive track or anything of this
nature, the waste products were excreted through skin.
One section of report did specify that cadavers were extremely
odorous, but this could be accounted for by either deterioration
or a number of things, but theory was that waste was excreted
through pores of skin. They could only theorize in report
because there was no xenobiology.
A report by Dr. J. Allen Hynek was recalled vividly which
indicated that he had also studied the information provided by
this particular case and that he felt that it was indeed a
genuine UFO capture and subsequently the alien was part of UFO.
Dr. Hynek was non-committal but did however sign the report.
Also indicated in report that he did not view bodies personally,
but viewed photographs and accompanying reports from autopsies.
Other photos dealt with a number of bodies which were
vivisectioned in various ways. At one point, a head was removed
from body and photographed and autopsy was performed on head.
The cranium was opened and brain matter was photographed and
evident. Interesting thing about photo was that there was a
ridge-bone or dividing partition-type bone running directly
through center of skull, from front to back, as though dividing
two brains, one from the other. This seemed apparent from the
picture. The skin was completely removed from cranial structure
and the skull was layed bare as much as possible.
At one point the skull was cut directly in half and photo showed
under developed esophagus and nasal cavities. No clear photo of
eye orbs as we know them, just photos of complete vivisection of
skull Itself.
Numerous photos of flesh of the
being starting with cutaneous and subcutaneous
micro-photographic plates. Appeared to be cellular studies done
under microscope and electron microscope type photos. Extreme
magnification of tissue samples.
This concluded the Bill English statement which was
transcribed from 2 cassette tapes. I obtained this handwritten
memorandum in August of 1987 from
Paul Bennewitz during my
visit with him in Albuquerque. In September of 1988 I received a
call from Bill English. I asked for a chance to meet him and
discuss the Grudge 13 report.
He said that this could be arranged
but that the meeting would have to be on his .terms for security
reasons. He explained that there had been several attempts on
his life by persons unknown since he had made the cassette tapes
about 6 years ago. We arranged a meeting at a small airport in
Virginia on September 16. I was to sit in the lobby with my
black flight bag and for identification purposes I told Bill
what I would be wearing. I had no telephone number for Bill.
As I walked in the small airport lobby after a 3 hour drive from
Richmond I immediately noticed 2 gentlemen who seemed out of
place for this locale. Both were wearing pin-striped 3 piece
suits, both had on dark glasses. One was a black gentlemen. One
was stationed Inside the lobby door looking out at the parking
lot, one was leaning up against an airline counter.
I sat down and after a few minutes
was approached by a tall, bearded man in Jeans and a heavy
jacket. He asked if I wanted to have a drink. We walked outside
and he introduced himself as Bill English. We drove In Bills car
into town to a local bar. About 5 minutes after we ordered and
had started to talk, the men I had seen at the airport came Into
the bar and sat down. We left for Bills house and never saw the
men again for the next 2 days.
During the next 2 days I stayed with Bill and his wife and 2
children in a small trailer in the middle of a field at his
farm. I asked him endless questions concerning the Grudge 13
document, how he happened to see it, what happened to him after
he saw it and literally thousands of questions about the content
of the document. My impression of Bill English was that he was
totally honest, that he stood behind his statements and
recollection of the Grudge 13 papers, that he was a devoted
husband and father to his wife' 2 children.
That Bill English was ready to come
forward and enter into any debate regarding the legitimacy of
the document and his recollections thereof. Of Bills compassion
for his father and his fathers feelings concerning Bill and the
reasons for their occasional disagreements. I have tremendous
respect for Bill and what he has tried to do in getting this
information out to the public. It has been at tremendous
personal risk not to mention the ridicule by sponsored agents
such at Bill Moore who has stated that the Grudge 13 papers are
a fraud.
What follows is additional information about the Grudge 13
papers that I obtained from Bill during my visit. In addition to
the following Bill painstakingly drew many sketches of the
photos of different types of flying saucers, the equipment
obtained from them including a sketch of the football sized
nuclear generator and sketches of the autopsy photos.
