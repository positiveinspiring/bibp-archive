# The Fact that Mass Surveillance DoesnÂ’t Keep Us Safe Goes Mainstream

Top Terrorism Experts Say that Mass Spying Doesnt
Work to Prevent Terrorism
The fact that mass spying on Americans isnt
necessary to keep us safe is finally going mainstream.
The top counter-terrorism czar under
Presidents Clinton and Bush - Richard Clarke -
says:
The argument that this sweeping search
must be kept secret from the terrorists is laughable. Terrorists
already assume this sort of thing is being done. Only law-abiding
American citizens were blissfully ignorant of what their government
was doing.
***
If the government wanted a particular
set of records, it could tell the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Court why - and then be granted permission to access those records
directly from specially maintained company servers. The telephone
companies would not have to know what data were being accessed.
There are no technical disadvantages to doing it that way, although
it might be more expensive.
Would we, as a nation, be willing to pay
a little more for a program designed this way, to avoid a situation
in which the government keeps on its own computers a record of every
time anyone picks up a telephone? That is a question that should
have been openly asked and answered in Congress.
William Binney - the head of NSAs
digital communications program -
says that he set up the NSAs system so that all of the information
would automatically be encrypted, so that the government had to
obtain a search warrant based upon probably cause before a particular
suspects communications could be decrypted.
But the NSA now collects all data in an
unencrypted form, so that no probable cause is needed to view any
citizens information.
He says that
it is actually cheaper and easier to store the data in an encrypted
format: so the governments current system is being done for political -
not practical - purposes.
Binneys statements have been
confirmed by other high-level NSA whistleblowers.
Binney also says:
NSA whistleblower
J. Kirk Wiebe has long said that such intrusions on Americans
privacy were never necessary to protect national security.
NSA whistleblower
Thomas Drake agrees. So does NSA whistleblower
Russell Tice.
Israeli-American terrorism expert Barry
Rubins
points out:
What is most important to understand
about the revelations of massive message interception by the U.S.
government is this:
In counterterrorist terms, it is a farce.
Basically the NSA, as one of my
readers suggested, is the digital equivalent of the TSA
strip-searching an 80 year-old Minnesota grandmothers rather
than profiling and focusing on the likely terrorists.
***
And
isnt it absurd that
the United States cant
stop a would-be terrorist in the U.S. army
who gives a power point presentation on why he is about to shoot
people (Major Nadal Hassan), cant follow up on Russian intelligence
warnings about Chechen terrorist contacts (the Boston bombing), or a
dozen similar incidents must now collect every telephone call in the
country?
A
system in which a photo shop clerk has to stop an attack on Fort Dix
by overcoming his fear of appearing racist to report a cell of
terrorists or brave passengers must jump a would-be underpants
bomber from Nigeria because his own fathers warning that he was a
terrorist was insufficient?
And how about a country where
terrorists and terrorist supporters
visit the White House, hang out with the FBI, advise the U.S.
government on counter-terrorist policy (even while, like CAIR)
advising Muslims not to cooperate with law enforcement
***
Or how
about the time when the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem had a
(previously jailed) Hamas agent working in their motor pool with
direct access to the vehicles and itineraries of all visiting US
dignitaries and senior officials.
***
Suppose the U.S. ambassador to Libya
warns that the American compound there may be attacked. No response.
Then he tells the deputy chief of mission that he is under attack.
No response.
Then the U.S. military is not allowed to
respond. Then the president goes to sleep without making a decision
about doing anything because communications break down between the
secretaries of defense and state and the president, who goes to
sleep because he has a very important fund-raiser the next day.
But dont worry because three billion
telephone calls by Americans are daily being intercepted and
supposedly analyzed.
In other words,
you have a massive counterterrorist
project costing $1 trillion but when it comes down to it the thing
repeatedly fails. In that case, to quote the former
secretary of state,
What difference does it make?
If one looks at the great intelligence
failures of the past, these two points quickly become obvious.
Take for example the Japanese
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
U.S. naval intelligence had broken
Japanese codes. They had the information needed to conclude the
attack would take place. [Background]
Yet a focus on the key to the problem
was not achieved. The important messages were not read and
interpreted; the strategic mindset of the leadership was not in
place.
***
And remember that the number of
terrorists caught by the TSA hovers around the zero level. The shoe,
underpants, and Times Square bombers werent even caught by security
at all and many other such cases can be listed. In addition to this,
the U.S.-Mexico border is practically open.
**
The war on al-Qaida has not really been
won, since its continued campaigning is undeniable and it has even
grown in Syria, partly thanks to
U.S. policy.
***
So the
problem of growing government spying is three-fold.
-
First, it is against the
American system and reduces liberty.
-
Second, it is a misapplication
of resources, in other words money is being spent and
liberty sacrificed for no real gain.
-
Third, since government
decision-making and policy about international terrorism is
very bad the threat is increasing.
Senators Wyden and Udall - both on the
Senate Intelligence Committee, with access to all of the top-secret
information about the governments spying programs -
write:
We are quite familiar with the bulk
email records collection program that operated under the USA Patriot
Act and has now been confirmed by senior intelligence officials.
We were very concerned about this
programs impact on Americans civil liberties and privacy rights,
and we spent a significant portion
of 2011 pressing intelligence officials to provide evidence of its
effectiveness. They were unable to do so
***
In our judgment it is also important to
note that intelligence agencies
made statements to both Congress and the Court that significantly
exaggerated this programs effectiveness.
This experience demonstrates to us that
intelligence agencies assessments of the usefulness of particular
collection programs - even significant ones - are not always
accurate.
This experience has also led us to be
skeptical of claims about the value of the bulk phone records
collection program in particular.
***
Assertions from intelligence agencies about the value and
effectiveness of particular programs should not simply be accepted
at face value by policymakers or oversight bodies
any more than statements about the usefulness of other government
programs should be taken at face value when they are made by other
government officials.
It is up to Congress, the courts and the
public to ask the tough questions and press even experienced
intelligence officials to back their assertions up with actual
evidence, rather than simply deferring to these officials
conclusions without challenging them.
NBC News
reported 2 days ago:
Ive never liked the idea of
security vs. privacy, because no one feels more secure in a
surveillance state, said Bruce Schneier, security expert and
author of Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in
an Insecure World.
Theres plenty of examples of security that
doesnt infringe on privacy. They are all around. Door locks.
Fences
Firewalls. People are forgetting that quite a lot of
security doesnt affect privacy. The real dichotomy is liberty
vs. control.
Dan Solove, a privacy law expert at
George Washington University Law School, said the privacy vs.
security framing has interfered with what could be a healthy
national debate about using high-tech tools to fight terror.
You have pollsters and pundits and
(National Intelligence Director James) Clapper saying, Do you
want us to catch the terrorists or do you want privacy? But
thats a false choice.
Its like asking, Do you want the police to exist or not? he
said.
We already have the most invasive
investigative techniques permissible with the right oversight.
With probable cause you can search my home
People want
limitations and transparency, so they can make a choice about
how much surveillance (they) are willing to tolerate.
By creating an either/or tension between
privacy and security, government officials have invented a heavy
weapon to wield against those who raise civil liberties concerns, he
said. Its easy to cast the choice in stark terms: Who wouldnt
trade a little personal data to save even one American life?
An honest, open examination of
surveillance programs might show the choice is not so simple, says
Ashkan Soltani, an independent security researcher.
The government feels like they need
all this information in order to do its job, that there cant be
security without them having access to everything. Well, thats
a lazy or shortsighted way of seeing things, he says.
The
idea I reject is that you need to violate everyones privacy
rather than be better at your job of identifying specific
(targets).
An article on Bloomberg notes that
real terrorists dont even use the normal phone service or
publicly-visible portions of the web that we innocent Americans use:
The debate over the U.S. governments
monitoring of digital communications suggests that Americans are
willing to allow it as long as it is genuinely targeted at
terrorists. What they fail to realize is that
the surveillance systems are best
suited for gathering information on law-abiding citizens.
***
The infrastructure set up by the
National Security Agency, however, may only be good for gathering
information on the stupidest, lowest-ranking of terrorists.
The Prism surveillance program focuses
on access to the servers of Americas largest Internet companies,
which support such popular services as Skype, Gmail and iCloud.
These are not the services that
truly dangerous elements typically use.
In a January 2012
report titled Jihadism on the Web: A Breeding Ground for Jihad
in the Modern Age,
the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service drew a
convincing picture of an Islamist Web underground centered around
core forums.
These websites are part of the Deep Web, or Undernet,
the multitude of online resources not indexed by commonly used
search engines.
The Netherlands security service,
which couldnt find recent data on the size of the Undernet, cited a
2003 study from the University of California at Berkeley as the
latest available scientific assessment.
The study found that
just 0.2 percent of the Internet could be searched.
The rest remained inscrutable and has probably grown since. In 2010,
Google Inc. said it had indexed just 0.004 percent of the
information on the Internet.
Websites aimed at attracting traffic do
their best to get noticed, paying to tailor their content to the
real or perceived requirements of search engines such as Google.
Terrorists have no such ambitions.
They prefer to lurk in the dark recesses
of the Undernet.
People who radicalize under the influence of jihadist websites
often go through a number of stages, the Dutch report said.
Their virtual activities increasingly shift to the invisible
Web, their security awareness increases and their activities
become more conspiratorial.
***
Communication on the core forums is
often encrypted. In 2012, a French court found nuclear physicist
Adlene Hicheur guilty of, among other things, conspiring to commit
an act of terror for distributing and using software called Asrar
al-Mujahideen, or Mujahideen Secrets.
The program employed various
cutting-edge encryption methods, including variable stealth ciphers
and RSA 2,048-bit keys.
***
Even
complete access to these servers brings U.S. authorities no closer
to the core forums. These must be infiltrated by more traditional
intelligence means, such as using agents posing as jihadists or by
informants within terrorist organizations.
Similarly, monitoring phone calls is
hardly the way to catch terrorists.
Theyre generally not dumb enough to use Verizon.
***
At best, the recent revelations
concerning Prism and telephone surveillance might deter potential
recruits to terrorist causes from using the most visible parts of
the Internet.
Beyond that, the governments efforts
are much more dangerous to civil liberties than they are to al-Qaeda
and other organizations like it.
(And
see this.)
Mass Spying Actually HURTS - Rather than Helps -
Anti-Terror Efforts
Not yet convinced?
Former NSA executive William Binney - who
was the head of the NSAs entire digital spying program -
told Daily Caller that the spying dragnet being carried out by the
government is less than useless:
Daily Caller: So it seems logical to
ask: Why do we need all of this new data collection when theyre not
following up obvious leads, such as an intelligence agency calling
and saying you need to be aware of this particular terrorist?
Binney: Its sensible to ask, but thats
exactly what theyre doing. Theyre
making themselves dysfunctional by collecting all of this data.
Theyve got so much collection capability but they cant do
everything.
***
[All this data gathered is] putting an extra burden on all of their
analysts. Its not something thats going to help them; its
something thats burdensome.
There are ways to do the analysis
properly, but they dont really want the solution because if they
got it, they wouldnt be able to keep demanding the money to solve
it. I call it their business statement,
Keep the problems going so the
money keeps flowing.
Its all about contracts and money.
***
The issue is, can you figure out whats
important in it? And figure out the intentions and capabilities of
the people youre monitoring? And they are in no way prepared to do
that, because that takes analysis.
Thats what the big
data initiative was all about out of the White House last year.
It was to try to get algorithms and figure out whats important and
tell the people whats important so that they can find things.
The probability of them finding whats
really there is low.
Indeed, even before 9/11 - when Binney was
building the precursor to the NSAs current digital collection system -
there
werent enough analysts to look through the more modest amount of data
being collected at the time:
The danger of the mass collection of
data by the NSA is that it buries analysts in data, said Binney,
who developed a
surveillance program called ThinThread intended to allow the NSA
to look at data but not collect it.
The NSA dumped that program in favor of
more extensive data collection.
The biggest problem was getting
data to a manageable level, he said. We didnt have enough
people, we couldnt hire enough people east of the Mississippi
to manage all the data we were getting.
Terrorism expert Barry Rubins
writes:
There is a fallacy behind the current
intelligence strategy of the United States, the collection of
massive amounts of phone calls, emails, and even credit card
expenditures, up to 3 billion phone calls a day alone, not to
mention the government spying on the mass media. It is this:
The more quantity of intelligence, the
better it is for preventing terrorism.
In the real, practical world this is -
though it might seem counterintuitive - untrue. You dont needto
put it in an exaggerated wayan atomic bomb against a flea. The
intelligence budget is not unlimited, is it? Where should hiring
priorities be put?
***
It is not the quantity of material that counts but the need to
locate and correctly understand the most vital material.
This requires your security forces to understand the ideological,
psychological, and organizational nature of the threat.
***
If the U.S. government cant even
figure out
what the Muslim Brotherhood is like or the dangers of
supporting Islamists to take over Syria, or the fact that the
Turkish regime is an American enemy, or cant even teach military
officers who the enemy is,
whats it going to do with scores of billions of telephone call
traffic to overcome terrorism?
It isnt even using the intelligence material it already has!
If,
however, the material is almost limitless, that actually weakens a
focus on the most needed intelligence regarding the most likely
terrorist threats.
Imagine, for example, going through billions of telephone calls even
with high-speed computers rather than, say, following up a tip from
Russian intelligence on a young Chechen man in Boston who is in
contact with terrorists or, for instance, the communications between
a Yemeni al-Qaida leader and a U.S. army major who is assigned as a
psychiatrist to Fort Hood.
That is why the old system of getting
warrants, focusing on individual email addresses, or sites, or
telephones makes sense, at least if it is only used properly. Then
those people who are communicating with known terrorists can be
traced further. There are no technological magic spells.
If analysts are incompetent
and leaders
unwilling to take proper action, who cares how much data was
collected?
***
Decision-makers and intelligence analysts only have so many hours in
the day. There can only be so many meetings; only so many
priorities. And the policymaking pyramid narrows rapidly toward the
top.
There
is a point of diminishing returns for the size of an intelligence
bureaucracy. Lower-priority tasks proliferate; too much paper is
generated and meetings are held; the system clogs when it has too
much data.
PC World
reports:
In
knowing a lot about a lot of different people [the data
collection] is great for that, said Mike German, a former
Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent whose policy
counsel for national security at the American Civil Liberties
Union.
In
actually finding the very few bad actors that are out there, not
so good.
The mass collection of data from
innocent people wont tell you how guilty people act, German
added.
The problem with catching terrorism
suspects has never been the inability to collect information, but to
analyze the oceans of information collected, he said.
Mass data collection is like trying to look for needles by building
bigger haystacks, added Wendy
Grossman, a freelance technology writer who helped organize the
conference.
New Republic
notes:
This kind of dragnet-style data capture
simply doesnt keep us safe.
First,
intelligence and law enforcement agencies are increasingly drowning
in data; the more that comes in, the harder it is to stay afloat.
Most recently, the failure of the intelligence community to
intercept the 2009 underwear bomber was blamed in large part on a
surfeit of information: according to an official
White House review, a significant amount of critical information
was embedded in a large volume of other data.
Similarly, the
independent investigation of the alleged shootings by U.S. Army
Major Nidal Hasan at Fort Hood concluded that the crushing volume
of information was one of the factors that hampered the FBIs
analysis before the attack.
Multiple security officials have echoed
this assessment. As one veteran CIA
agent
told The Washington Post in 2010,
The problem is that the system is clogged with information.
Most of it isnt of interest, but people are afraid not to put
it in.
A
former Department of Homeland Security official
told a Senate subcommittee that there was a lot of data
clogging the system with no value.
Even former Defense Secretary Robert
Gates
acknowledged that,
weve built tremendous capability, but do we
have more than we need?
And the
NSA itself was brought to a grinding halt before 9/11 by the
torrent of data pouring into the system, leaving the agency
brain-dead for half a week and [unable] to process information,
as its then-director Gen. Michael Hayden publicly
acknowledged.
National security hawks say theres a
simple answer to this glut: data mining.
The NSA has apparently
described its computer systems as having the ability to
manipulate and analyze huge volumes of data at mind-boggling
speeds. Could those systems pore through this information trove to
come up with unassailable patterns of terrorist activity?
The
Department of Defense and
security experts have concluded that the answer is no: There is
simply no known way to effectively anticipate terrorist threats.
***
The FBIs and NSAs scheme is an affront
to democratic values. Lets also not pretend its an effective and
efficient way of keeping us safe.
Fortune writes that the
NSAs big data strategy is ineffective:
The evidence for big data is scant at
best. To date, large fields of data have generated meaningful
insights at times, but not on the scale many have promised.
This disappointment has been documented
in the
Wall Street Journal,
Information Week, and
SmartData Collective.
***
According to my firms research, local
farmers in India with tiny fields frequently outperform - in
productivity and sustainability - a predictive global model
developed by one of the worlds leading agrochemical companies.
Why? Because they develop unique
planting, fertilizing, or harvesting practices linked to the
uniqueness of their soil, their weather pattern, or the rare
utilization of some compost. There is more to learn from a local
Indian outlier than from building a giant multivariate yield
prediction model of all farms in the world.
The same is true for terrorism. Dont
look for a needle in a giant haystack. Find one needle in a small
clump of hay and see whether similar clumps of hay also contain
needles.
You need local knowledge to glean
insights from any data. I once ran a data-mining project with
Wal-Mart (WMT)
where we tried to figure out sales patterns in New England.
One of the questions was,
Why are our gun sales lower in
Massachusetts than in other states, even accounting for the
liberal bias of the state?
The answer: There were city ordinances
prohibiting the sale of guns in many towns. I still remember the
disappointed look of my client when he realized the answer had come
from a few phone calls to store managers rather than from a
multivariate regression model.
So, please, Mr. President, stop building
your giant database in the sky and quit hoping that algorithm
experts will generate a terrorist prevention strategy from that
data. Instead, rely on your people in the field to detect suspicious
local patterns of behavior, communication, or spending, then
aggregate data for the folks involved and let your data hounds loose
on these focused samples.
You and I will both sleep better.
And I wont have to worry about who is
lurking in the shadows of my business or bedroom.
Security expert Bruce Schneier
explained in 2005:
Many believe data mining is the
crystal ball that will enable us to uncover future terrorist plots.
But even in the most wildly optimistic projections, data mining
isnt tenable for that purpose.
Were not trading
privacy for security; were giving up privacy and getting no
security in return.
***
The promise of data mining is
compelling, and convinces many. But its wrong.
Were not going to find terrorist
plots through systems like this, and were going to waste valuable
resources chasing down false alarms.
***
Data-mining systems wont uncover any
terrorist plots until they are very accurate, and that even very
accurate systems will be so flooded with false alarms that they will
be useless.
All data-mining systems fail in two
different ways: false positives and false negatives.
***
Data mining for terrorist plots will be
sloppy, and itll be hard to find anything useful.
***
When it comes to terrorism, however,
trillions of connections exist between people and events - things
that the data-mining system will have to look at - and very few
plots. This rarity makes even accurate identification systems
useless.
Lets look at some numbers. Well be
optimistic - well assume the system has a one in 100 false-positive
rate (99 percent accurate), and a one in 1,000 false-negative rate
(99.9 percent accurate). Assume 1 trillion possible indicators to
sift through: thats about 10 events - e-mails, phone calls,
purchases, web destinations, whatever - per person in the United
States per day. Also assume that 10 of them are actually terrorists
plotting.
This unrealistically accurate system
will generate 1 billion false alarms for every real terrorist plot
it uncovers. Every day of every year, the police will have to
investigate 27 million potential plots in order to find the one real
terrorist plot per month.
Raise that false-positive accuracy to an
absurd 99.9999 percent and youre still chasing 2,750 false alarms
per day - but that will inevitably raise your false negatives, and
youre going to miss some of those 10 real plots.
This isnt anything new. In statistics,
its called the base rate fallacy,
and it applies in other domains as well. For example, even highly
accurate medical tests are useless as diagnostic tools if the
incidence of the disease is rare in the general population.
Terrorist attacks are also rare, any test is going to result in an
endless stream of false alarms.
This is exactly the sort of thing we saw
with the NSAs eavesdropping program: the New York Times
reported that the computers spat out
thousands of tips per month. Every one of them turned out to be
a false alarm.
And the cost was enormous - not just for
the FBI agents running around chasing dead-end leads instead of
doing things that might actually make us safer, but also the cost in
civil liberties.
***
Finding terrorism plots is not a problem that lends itself to data
mining. Its a needle-in-a-haystack problem, and throwing more hay
on the pile doesnt make that problem any easier.
Wed be far better off putting people in
charge of investigating potential plots and letting them direct the
computers, instead of putting the computers in charge and letting
them decide who should be investigated.
Schneier
noted in 2008:
According to a
massive report from the National Research Council, data mining
for terrorists doesnt work.
NBC News
reports:
Casting such wide nets is also
ineffective, [security researcher Ashkan Soltani] argues.
Collecting mountains and mountains of
data simply means that when the
time comes to find that proverbial needle in a haystack, youve
simply created a bigger haystack.
Law enforcement is being sold bill
of goods that the more data you get, the better your security
is. We find that is not true, Soltani said.
Collecting data is a hard habit to
break, as many U.S. corporations have discovered after years of
expensive data breaches. The NSAs data hoard may be useful in
future investigations, helping agents in the future in unpredictable
ways, some argue.
Schneier doesnt buy it.
The NSA has this fetish for data,
and will get it any way they can, and get as much as they can,
he said. But old ladies who
hoard newspapers say the same thing, that someday, this might be
useful.
Even worse, an overreliance on Big Data
surveillance will shift focus from other security techniques that
are both less invasive and potentially more effective, like
old-fashioned spycraft, Soltani says.
Nassim Taleb
writes:
Big data may mean more information, but
it also means more false
information.
***
Because of excess data as compared to
real signals, someone looking at history from the vantage point of a
library will necessarily find many more spurious relationships than
one who sees matters in the making; he will be duped by more
epiphenomena.
Even experiments can be marred with bias,
especially when researchers hide failed attempts or formulate a
hypothesis after the results - thus fitting the hypothesis to the
experiment (though the bias is smaller there).
This is the tragedy of big data: The
more variables, the more correlations that can show significance.
Falsity also grows faster than information; it is nonlinear (convex)
with respect to data (this convexity in fact resembles that of a
financial option payoff).
Noise is antifragile.
Source: N.N. Taleb
If big data leads to more false
correlations, then mass surveillance may lead to
more false accusations of terrorism.
(Just
what we need...)
