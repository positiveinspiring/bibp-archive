Would you renounce your U.S. citizenship
if it meant youd be sending less of your hard-earned dollars to
Uncle Sam?
-
Do you want affordable health care?
-
Do you desire to live a long and healthy
life?
-
Do you want your children to have an
affordable college education?
-
Do you want to retire in relative
comfort?
-
Do you desire live your life in relative
freedom and not have to worry government harassment?
If you answered in the affirmative to most of
these questions, it might be time to start packing your bags and looking for
greener pastures.
Americans Are Voting With Their
Feet
Are you tired of living under relative tyranny
where every email is read, every phone call is listened to and your every
movement is tracked by a number of electronic devices?
Americans are leaving the country at breakneck
speed and the annual rate of expatriation is growing as over
150,000 Americans departed the former land of liberty for greener
pastures overseas in the past year. In total, over
five
million Americans are choosing to live outside the United States.
Just why are Americans leaving this land of
freedom and opportunity in record numbers, with no end in sight?
Unaffordable College Education
Costs
The Education Policy Institute
assessed the affordability of higher education costs and found that the
United States ranks 13th in higher education affordability.
To those who think your children can borrow
their way to a degree, think again. Todays U.S. college loan practices,
which serves to underwrite much of the cost of a college education, are the
most predatory in the world.
As of last year,
bankruptcy cannot
cancel out a student loan
debt and delinquent college students can now go to jail for nonpayment. In
fact, several federal agencies have even swat
teamed (below video) many delinquent student loan defaulters:
Nowhere else in the
world can we find evidence of these types of predatory practices being used
against college students as we do here in the United States.
Even if young adults obtain their degree, those
who are degreed and/or skilled in fields such as engineering or information
technology skills, are really wasting their time working in the United
States.
Eight of the worlds ten highest-paying
countries for information technology (IT) managers are in Western Europe,
according to a new
survey by Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
The survey found that Swiss managers are paid
the most, followed by those in Germany and Denmark. In fact, IT management
is another field where U.S. workers fail to crack the top ten in income, the
United States ranks
14th in IT management compensation.
Even debt ridden Spain, Italy and Greece pay
their IT managers more than what Americans earn on average
Americans Retire Comfortably
Nothing could be further from the truth.
America, you are
not getting the best pension package compared to other Western nations
as America ranks dead last in overall pension benefits.
And this is in the backdrop of the
nothing-to-lose, second term Obama Administration, is preparing to
seize
your 401k pensions.
America, your money is not even safe in the bank
as witnessed by the fact that the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals who just
ruled that
banks can steal the money of its depositors and it is legal!
This would have been a SHTF moment in every
other Western country, but Americans are taking this grand theft on their
backsides, sipping a beer and rooting for their favorite American Bachelor.
There are no golden years in America unless you
are in the infamous 1%.
Americans Have the Most Freedoms
Anyone who believes this fiction needs to turn
off their TV and start reading the summaries of Executive Orders and passed
Congressional legislation.
With the Patriot Acts, the NDAA and several
other draconian pieces of legislation designed to protect us from the boogey
men we call terrorists, we have lost Habeus Corpus, we are losing our free
speech rights to the United Nations and every form of due process that
we once cherished under our Constitution.
And if you dont like the unfolding criminal
enterprise which suddenly appeared before our collective eyes, the bankers
have rolled out a technocratic police state which would make Stalin and
Hitler envious.
Both the police state and impending martial law
are bolstered by the fact that the
Department of Homeland Security has purchased 1.6 billion rounds, oops,
make that 2.2 billion rounds of high tech bullets engraved with the names of
citizens who dare to oppose this tyranny!
America Is Still the Land of
Opportunity
First and foremost,
Americans no longer live in the highest salary paying country in the
world.
In fact, the United States does not even crack
the top ten list of the highest salary paying countries on the planet in
which,
-
Switzerland
-
Germany
-
Denmark
-
Japan
-
Norway
-
Austria
-
Belgium
-
Ireland
-
the Netherlands
-
the United Kingdom,
...round out the top ten and pay their workers
more than workers in the United States.
In fact,
the United States only ranks 20th in terms of overall gross pay! One
would be very naive to call America the land of opportunity.
The Highest Taxes In the World
Overwhelmingly, the number one reason that
Americans are fleeing the country is because of high taxes.
The income tax rate
rose this year to 39.6% from 35% for individuals earning more than
$400,000 a year and married couples earning more than $450,000. As of this
year, 77% of Americans will pay higher federal tax rates because the cuts in
Social Security payroll taxes expired when Congress passed its tax package
on New Years Day.
The Tax Policy Center estimates that those who
earn more than $1 million would pay an
average of $170,341 more in taxes.
State taxes are also rising as evidenced by the
state of California which enacted Proposition 30, that effectively raised
state income tax rates to 10.3% from 9.3% for individuals making at least
$250,000 and 13.3% from 10.3% for those earning at least $1 million.
Golfer
Phil Mickelson publicly voiced his concern over the tax increases and
threatened to leave California because of the higher rates.
Expatriation does favor the rich. Consider the
following examples. If you are wealth and make, say, $1 million per year,
you would save $396,000 in annual taxes by relocating to Monaco based upon
the highest tax bracket of 39.6%. However, if you are a person of average
means and only make about $50,000 per year, you would save $12,500 in annual
taxes based upon being in the 25% tax bracket.
If tax reduction is your primary reason for
putting the U.S. in the rear view mirror, you will be financially ahead
regardless of your income. Of course, one has to have an income to benefit
from a potential move. In other words, if you are the owner of an Obama
phone, you are better off staying in the country.
To rub salt in the proverbial wound, the U.S. is
one of the few nations that taxes its citizens regardless of where they live
in the world.
As long as you remain a U.S. citizen, you will
be taxed on your income even if youre living abroad.
At Least We Have Our Health
Our education is substandard, our earning power
is substandard, our tax rates are exorbitant and we increasingly live in a
rapidly emerging police state.
But at least we have our health. Unfortunately,
that is not quite true as the United States spends more than the next 12
nations for health care.
However, it seems as if we are spending more and
enjoying it less as, despite our exorbitant spending on health care, the
United States ranks
50th in the world in life expectancy.
Cuba, Puerto Rico and Spain have higher life expectancies than the
United States.
Americans live in the only country in the world
where its citizens cannot bargain shop for its medicines in foreign
countries because the pharmaceuticals have convinced congress to establish a
pharmaceutical monopoly over U.S. citizens.
Death by doctor has
increased to 225,000 per year.
And with Obamacare death panels looming on the
near horizon, things can only get worse.
Some Things To Consider Before
You Leave
As Americans face crushingly higher taxes and
increasingly draconian enforcement tactics, an increasingly greater number
of Americans are choosing to flee for greener pastures.
It is actually fairly easy to renounce ones own
U.S. citizenship.
The
U.S. Department of State regulations state that the potential ex-patriot
must appear in person before a U.S. consular or diplomatic officer, in a
foreign country and sign an oath of renunciation.
One should consider their renunciation action
carefully because it is irrevocable once declared.
However, nothing is quite as simple as it
appears when dealing with our criminal government that has been hijacked by
the bankers.
If you try and leave America, your will be
assessed a 15% exit fee. Yes, that is correct, you are penalized for
exercising the privilege to leave the country. Do you remember as children
we were taught to make fun of the Soviet Union for building fences to keep
their citizens in?
By the way, Russia has a flat 13% tax rate.
Where To Go?
I predict that under this pathetic president and
our insider-trading congress, millions are going to be looking to leave the
country.
It is my belief that if the number of
expatriates grows much beyond present levels, the government will enact
policies to make it increasingly more difficult to leave the country.
Where would you go? What factors would you
consider when choosing a relocation country?
