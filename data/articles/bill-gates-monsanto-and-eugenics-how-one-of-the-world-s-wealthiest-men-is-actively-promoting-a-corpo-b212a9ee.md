After it was exposed that the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation, the philanthropic brainchild of Microsoft founder Bill
Gates, purchased 500,000
shares in Monsanto back in 2010 valued at more than
$23 million, it became abundantly clear that this so-called benevolent
charity is up to something other than eradicating disease and feeding the
world's poor (guardian.co.uk).
It turns out that the Gates family legacy has
long been one of trying to dominate and control the world's systems,
including in the areas of technology, medicine, and now agriculture.
The Gates Foundation, aka the tax-exempt Gates Family Trust, is currently in
the process of spending billions of dollars in the name of humanitarianism
to establish a
global food monopoly dominated by
genetically-modified (GM)
crops and seeds.
And based on the Gates family's history of
involvement in world affairs, it appears that one of its main goals besides
simply establishing corporate control of the world's food supply is to
reduce the world's population by a significant amount in the process.
William H. Gates Sr.,
former head of eugenics group Planned Parenthood
Bill Gates' father, William H. Gates Sr., has long been involved with the
eugenics group Planned Parenthood, a rebranded organization birthed out of
the American Eugenics Society.
In a 2003 interview with PBS' Bill Moyers,
Bill Gates admitted that his father used to
be the head of Planned Parenthood, which was founded on the concept that
most human beings are just "reckless breeders" and "human weeds" in need of
culling.
Gates also admitted during the interview that his family's involvement in
reproductive issues throughout the years has been extensive, referencing his
own prior adherence to the beliefs of eugenicist
Thomas Robert Malthus, who
believed that populations of the world need to be controlled through
reproductive restrictions.
Though Gates claims he now holds a different
view, it appears as though his foundation's initiatives are just a modified
Malthusian approach that much more discreetly reduces populations through
vaccines and GMOs.
Gates Foundation has
invested heavily in converting Asian, African agricultural systems to GMOs
William Gates Sr.'s association with Planned Parenthood and continued
influence in the realm of "population and reproductive health" is
significant because
Gates Sr. is co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation.
This long-time eugenicist "guides the vision and
strategic direction" of the Gates Foundation, which is currently heavily
focused on forcing GMOs on Africa via its financing of the Alliance for a
Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA).
The Gates Foundation has admittedly given at
least
$264.5 million in grant commitments to
AGRA, and also reportedly hired Dr. Robert Horsch, a former Monsanto
executive for 25 years who
developed Roundup, to head up AGRA back in 2006.
According to
a report published in La Via Campesina back in 2010, 70 percent of AGRA's
grantees in Kenya work directly with Monsanto, and nearly 80 percent of the
Gates Foundation funding is devoted to biotechnology.
The same report explains that the Gates Foundation pledged $880 million in
April 2010 to create the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP),
which is a heavy promoter of GMOs. GAFSP, of course, was responsible for
providing $35 million in "aid" to earthquake-shattered Haiti to be used for
implementing GMO agricultural systems and technologies.
Back in 2003, the Gates Foundation invested $25 million in "GM (genetically
modified) research to develop vitamin and protein-enriched seeds for the
world's poor," a move that many
international charities and farmers groups vehemently
opposed.
And in 2008, the Gates Foundation awarded $26.8
million to Cornell University to research GM wheat, which is the next major
food crop in the crosshairs of
Monsanto's GM food crop pipeline.
If you control
agriculture, you control the populations of the world
The Gates Foundation's ties with Monsanto and corporate agriculture in
general speak volumes about its real agenda, which is to create a
monopolistic system of world control in every area of human life.
Vaccines, pharmaceuticals, GMOs, reproductive
control, weather manipulation, global warming - these and many other points
of entry are the means by which the Gates Foundation is making great strides
to control the world by pretending to help improve and save it.
Rather than promote real food sovereignty and address the underlying
political and economic issues that breed poverty, Gates and Co. has instead
embraced the promotion of corporately-owned and controlled agriculture and
medicine paradigms that will only further enslave the world's most
impoverished.
It is abundantly evident that GMOs have ravished
already-impoverished people groups by destroying their native agricultural
systems,
as has been seen in India.
Some may say Gates' endeavors are all about the money, while others may say
they are about power and control. Perhaps it is a combination of both, where
Gates is still in the business of promoting his own commercial investments,
which includes buying shares in Monsanto while simultaneously investing in
programs to promote Monsanto.
Whatever the case may be, there is simply no denying that Gates now has a
direct interest in seeing Monsanto succeed in spreading GMOs around the
world.
And since Gates is openly facilitating
Monsanto's growth into new markets through his "humanitarian" efforts, it is
clear that the Gates family is in bed with Monsanto.
"Although Bill Gates might try to say that
the Foundation is not linked to his business, all it proves is the
opposite: most of their donations end up favoring the commercial
investments of the tycoon, not really "donating" anything, but instead
of paying taxes to state coffers, he invests his profits in where it is
favorable to him economically, including propaganda from their supposed
good intentions," wrote Silvia Ribeiro in the Mexican
news source La Jornada back in 2010.
"On the contrary, their 'donations' finance projects as destructive as
geoengineering or replacement of natural community medicines for
high-tech patented medicines in the poorest areas of the world...
Gates
is also engaged in trying to destroy rural farming worldwide, mainly
through the 'Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa' (AGRA).
It works
as a Trojan horse to deprive poor African farmers of their traditional
seeds, replacing them with the seeds of their companies first, finally
by genetically modified (GM)."
