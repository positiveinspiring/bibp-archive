"... a light will shine through that
window, a beam of light will come down upon you, you will experience
an epiphany ... and you will suddenly realize that you must go to
the polls and vote for Obama"

Some see God's will in Obama win, by Dahleen Glanton

EAST POINT, Ga.The day after Barack Obama was elected president, Larry Younginer knelt in front of the congregants at his suburban Atlanta church
and offered a prayer of thanks.
"Lord, we have again come to you in prayer, and you have heard our cries
from heaven, and you have sent us again from the state called Illinois, a
man called Barack to heal our land," said Younginer, a 62-year-old retired
information systems worker at Coca Cola in Atlanta. "We pray that you will
build a hedge around him that will protect him from those who would do him
harm."
Younginer, like many others, is convinced that Obama was destined to be
president. The mere fact that he won the presidency against the odds has
caused some Christians, particularly African-Americans, to see the hand of
God in his victory after so many years of struggle.
Lawrence Carter, dean of the Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel
said many people look for a sign from God when times are turbulent. And, he
said, there are many elements to Obama's win in which Christians can find
spiritual significance.
"It is powerful and significant on a spiritual level that there is the
emergence of Barack Obama 40 years after the passing of Dr. King," said
Carter. "No one saw him coming, and Christians believe God comes at us from
strange angles and places we don't expect, like Jesus being born in a
manger."

One particular work invoked the sacred,
picturing Obama's great head - illuminated by sunbursts - emerging from the
clouds over a bare-breasted maiden who is robed in an American flag and
emerging from a volcano.
Note that in the lower-left-hand middle, an
assemblage of people are literally kneeling before Obama.
As
observed by Jonathan V. Last in a visit to the "Manifest Hope" gallery,
which brings together many of the classic works of Obama along with new
additions.
Obama: "Son of
Promise, Child of Hope"

Barack Obama: "Son of
Promise, Child of Hope"
(Simon & Schuster, 2008)
Ever since Barack Obama was young, Hope has
lived inside him. From the beaches of Hawaii to the streets of Chicago, from
the jungles of Indonesia to the plains of Kenya, he has held on to Hope.
Even as a boy, Barack knew he wasn't quite like anybody else, but through
his journeys he found the ability to listen to Hope and become what he was
meant to be: a bridge to bring people together.
This is the moving story of an exceptional man, as told by Nikki Grimes and
illustrated by Bryan Collier, both winners of the Coretta Scott King Award.
Barack Obama has motivated Americans to believe with him, to believe that
every one of us has the power to change ourselves and change our world.
OMBama Yoga - "Invoke
the Spirit of Obama's Own Phrase"
from "Ohm-bama
time in Denver. Quest for seats to hear Obama's acceptance speech"
Chicago Sun-Times August 9, 2008
Denver hasn't hosted a Democratic National Convention for 100 years, and
it's a safe bet that the last time the Dems stampeded into town there were
no yoga studios selling tee-shirts with the Boy Orator and presumptive
presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan on them.
Did somebody say Boy Orator?
The silver-tongued Barack Obama's words are on
tee shirts selling at Om Time, an oasis of tranquility sandwiched between
the Colorado Democratic headquarters on one corner, and the center for the
Obama campaign on the other, along with a slice of tattoo shop and art
gallery garnish.
"The Union may never be perfect but generation after
generation has shown that it can always be perfected," proclaims the
tee-shirt in the Om Time window.
It hangs just south of the shri shrine, and the peace and love tee shirts
you'd expect. Walk by quickly and you'd think the silk-screened image of
Obama's close-shaved head was Ghandi's.
It was to hear more of those sentiments from the man himself - Obama, not Ghandi
- that people started lining up at the Obama campaign office at least
an hour before it was scheduled to open.

"One Nation, Under a
New Obama Salute"
from
One Nation, Under a New Obama Salute
U.S. News and World Report's "Washington
Whispers"
Thursday, August 07, 2008
George Bush had his three-fingered W salute that supporters flashed when
greeting him at presidential campaign events in 2000.
And now, if a Los Angeles creative agency gets
its way, Sen. Barack Obama will see fans meet him with his own salute
like the one above.
"Our goal is to see a crowd of 75,000 people
at Obama's nomination speech holding their hands above their heads,
fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country, a
renewed hope, and acceptance of responsibility for our future," says
Rick Husong, owner of The Loyalty Inc...
"We thought, 'Let's try and start a movement
where even while walking down the street, people would hold up the O and
you would know that they were for Obama,'" says Husong.
Much thought
went into the relatively simple idea.
"You interlace your hands in a
circle, the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people
coming together and the circle a symbol of unity," he says. ...
"We want to see it everywhere, but more importantly we want this sign to
take the world by storm."
