Seed Savers Exchange, Inc., a leading
non-profit organization dedicated to saving and sharing heirloom seeds, has
announced that a third deposit of heirloom seeds has been deposited safely
into the
Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway.
Acting President and Executive Director Aaron Whaley confirmed that
Seed Savers Exchange (SSE) has carefully selected and sent a total of
1,389 open pollinated varieties to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault since it
opened in February 2008. SSE's recent deposit will help push the total
number of accessions held at Svalbard to over 500,000.
Even though Seed Savers' share represents only a small portion of the total
deposits at Svalbard, the organization's contribution is unique because the
heirloom varieties are mostly seeds conserved by home gardeners.
Here is a small sampling of the varieties in the
most recent deposit:
"It is very reassuring to know that all of
these varieties are in the vault for safekeeping," Whaley says. "It is
especially moving for me to see that the German Pink Tomato has made its
way back across the Atlantic."
The German Pink Tomato was brought to
America in 1883 by his maternal Great-Great Grandparents Michael Ott and
Margaret Ertle from Dreuschendorf, Germany, and has been grown every summer
by the family.
In fact, German Pink was one of the two original varieties
that inspired the founding of Seed Savers Exchange in 1975 by his parents.
Whaley also points out that,
"Seed banks are one of the great ways to
safeguard seeds; the other is to have the seeds growing in gardens far
and wide."
Members of the Seed Savers Exchange can gain
access to the same seeds deposited in Svalbard through the annual 500-page
Yearbook that is distributed to SSE's 12,500 members.
The Yearbook - listing 13,263 unique varieties -
serves as a networking tool linking members in sharing varieties with one
another. Over the past 35 years, members have shared hundreds of thousands
of varieties.
The
Svalbard Global Seed Vault functions like
the ultimate safety deposit box for biodiversity and global food supply
preservation, storing duplicate collections of seeds on behalf of gene banks
from around the world.
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault offers protection
against permanent loss due to natural disasters, wars, equipment failures,
accidents, and loss of funding that can plague even the best gene banks. As
a service to the world community, the Government of Norway paid for
completing the Svalbard Global Seed Vault's construction.
The
Global Crop Diversity Trust and the
Government of Norway are financing its operating costs.
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is managed
by the Nordic Gene Bank (NordGen)
under a tripartite agreement between the Government of Norway, the Global
Crop Diversity Trust, and NordGen. Storage of seed in the Svalbard Global
Seed Vault is free of charge.
Located 78 degrees north, far above mainland Norway, three vault rooms have
been carved inside a mountain, down a 125-yard tunnel chiseled out of solid
stone. Naturally cold, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault is further cooled to
below -2 degrees Fahrenheit.
At this temperature, seeds can be stored safely
for decades - even if the earth warms or power goes out. The Svalbard
Global Seed Vault has the capacity to store 4.5 million different seed
samples (each sample containing about 500 seeds) potentially from 1,400 gene
banks in more than 100 countries.
The Seed Vault will soon house and secure the
world's largest collection of seeds, including many varieties no longer
grown by farmers or gardeners.
