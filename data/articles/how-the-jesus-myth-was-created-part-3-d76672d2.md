The Book: "The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors or Christianity Before Christ
This Awareness indicates that there
is a book which entities should study if they are further interested in this.
It is titled
16 Crucified Saviors or
Christianity Before Christ,
something to that effect. This Awareness indicates that it tells of the various
parallels to the Christian story from earlier writings of other cultures,
wherein the hero of those earlier cultures and writings experienced or acted
out the same kind of activities as did the later Jesus Christ in the Christian
religion, these down to details, such as the washing of the feet, healing
the blind, and raising of the dead, and similar teachings to that of Jesus
and also the Virgin Birth and being hanged or otherwise killed for this effort.
This Awareness indicates that the
Krishna parallel is the one which contains the most similar experiences, but
there are also a number of others, a total of 16 saviors in all, whose lives
paralleled Jesus, even in some of the exact situations.
Awareness
has Discussed the Last Taboo Area
This Awareness indicates that It
has covered an area that It previously listed as one of the last areas
of taboo, discussing Christianity and religion. This Awareness indicates that
it is amazing how religion can get started and grow and become so powerful.
At some point, money becomes extremely important in a religion and when money
begins to take on its extreme importance, when a religion becomes well-funded
by a people, the religion grows ever so-quickly and becomes much more established
in a material sense, and therefore its roots become strong and it grows even
without close examination.
(Why people accept a religion without much question)
Jehovah's
Witness and Mormons Prevent Challenges
In some cases, entities will take
extreme action to hide any challenge or to quell any challenge to the religion.
This was done in Christianity. This Awareness indicates it has also been accomplished
in a number of other religions, including the
Mormon Church and the
Jehovah's
Witnesses.
This Awareness indicates that as
entities see their religion growing, it makes more entities feel the religion
must have validity, or why would it grow so much, and therefore, they jump
on the bandwagon, so to speak, simply because that's what everyone is doing.
This Awareness indicates in other words, the stronger the growth of a religion,
the more quickly and easily it is accepted without discernment as to its validity.
At the beginning, a religion struggles
from the belief of a few people. This Awareness indicates that eventually,
those few people fade and others take it on, and without questioning, the
religion is eventually accepted by others simply because someone says "This
is the one!" and that is enough for some entities, and then they become
fanatical about their religion.
Most people never stop to question
the origin or the validity of their religion. They simply accept the claims
promoted by the religion and its promoters. This Awareness indicates that
it is like a stream-roller or a locomotive. It is hard to get started, but
once it starts rolling, it is almost impossible to stop.
Remember:
Always be Allowed to Doubt, to Question!
This Awareness indicates that it
wishes entities to recognize the need for always being allowed to question,
to explore, and not be forced into belief of anything. You may accept something
partially, believe something, but keep some of your doubts at all times in
order to evaluate the concepts and ideas, which you hold clear, for that creates
a healthy mind, one which is not closed by some programming, but one which
can evaluate, study and explore from evidence. This Awareness reminds you,
the mind is never truly thinking until it turns and question everything it
knows.
