# The Latest from "DHS Insider" - Government Control Plans for The Near 
Futures

DH: Do I have your permission to record this
conversation?
RB: You do.
DH: Ive received a lot of e-mail from people wondering where you went
and why youve been so quiet.
RB: As I told you earlier, things are very dicey. Weird things began to
happen before the election and have continued since. Odd things, a
clampdown of sorts.
I started looking and I found [REDACTED AT THE
REQUEST OF THIS SOURCE], and that shook me up. Im not the only one,
though, that found a [REDACTED], so this means theres surveillance of
people within DHS by DHS.
So, that explains this cloak and dagger stuff
for this meeting.
DH: I understand. What about the others?
RB: They are handling it the same way.
DH: Ive received many e-mails asking if you are the same person giving
information to Ulsterman. Are you?
RB: No, but I think I know at least one of his insiders.
DH: Care to elaborate?
RB: Sorry, no.
DH: Do you trust him or her. I mean, the Ulsterman source?
RB: Yes.
DH: Okay, so last August, you said things were going hot. I printed
what you said, and things did not seem to happen as you said.
RB: Youd better recheck your notes and compare [them] with some of the
events leading up to the election.
I think youll find that a full blown
campaign of deception took place to make certain Obama got back into
office. The polls, the media, and a few incidents that happened in the
two months before the election.
I guess if people are looking for some
big event they can point to and say aha for verification, well then I
overestimated peoples ability to tell when they are being lied to.
DH: What specific incidents are you referring to?
RB: Look at the threats to Obama. Start there.
The accusations of
racism. Then look at the polls, and especially the judicial decisions
about voter ID laws. Bought and paid for, or where there was any
potential for problems, the judges got the message, loud and clear.
Then
look at the voter fraud. And not a peep from the Republicans. Nothing.
His second term was a done deal in September. This was planned.
Frankly,
the Obama team knew they had it sewn up long before election day.
Benghazi could have derailed them, but the fix was in there, so I never
saw anything on my end to suggest a ready-made solution had to be
implemented.
DH: Whats going on now?
RB: People better pay close attention over the next few months. First,
there wont be any meaningful deal about the fiscal crisis. This is
planned, I mean, the lack of deal is planned. In fact, it necessary to
pave the way for what is in the short term agenda.
DH: Wait, youre DHS - not some Wall Street insider.
RB: So you think they are separate agendas? Thats funny.
The
coming
collapse of the U.S. dollar is a done deal. Its been in the works for
years - decades, and this is one of the most important cataclysmic
events that DHS is preparing for.
I almost think that DHS was created
for that purpose alone, to fight Americans, not protect them, right here
in America. But thats not the only reason. Theres the gun issue too.
DH: So, what are you seeing at DHS?
RB: We dont have a lot of time, tonight - our meeting - as well as a
country.
I mean I have heard - with my own ears - plans being made that
originate from the White House that involve the hierarchy of DHS. You
got to know how DHS works at the highest of levels. Its Jarrett and
Napolitano, with Jarrett organizing all of the plans and approaches.
Shes the one in charge, at least from my point of view, from what I am
seeing.
Obama knows thats going on and has say, but it seems that
Jarrett has the final say, not the other way around. Its [screwed] up.
This really went into high gear since the election.
But its a train wreck at mid management, but is more effective at the
lower levels. A lot of police departments are being gifted with federal
funds with strings attached. That money is flowing out to municipal
police departments faster than it can be counted. They are using this
money to buy tanks, well, not real tanks, but you know what I mean.
DHS
is turning the police into soldiers.
By the way, there has been a lot of communication recently between
Napolitano and Pistole [TSA head]. They are planning to use TSA agents
in tandem with local police for certain operations that are being
planned right now.
This is so [deleted] important that you cannot even
begin to imagine. If you get nothing else out of this, please, please
make sure you tell people to watch
the TSA and their increasing
involvement against the American public.
They are the stooges who will
be the ones to carry out certain plans when the dollar collapses and the
gun confiscation begins.
DH: Whoa, wait a minute. You just said a mouthful. Whats the agenda
here?
RB: Your intelligence insider - he knows that we are facing a planned
economic collapse. You wrote about this in your articles about Benghazi,
or at least thats what I got out of the later articles.
So why the
surprise?
DH: Theres a lot here. Lets take it step by step if you dont mind.
RB: Okay, but Im not going to give it to you in baby steps. Big boy
steps.
This is what I am hearing. Life for the average American is going
to change significantly, and not the change people expect.
First, DHS is
preparing to work with police departments and the TSA to respond to
civil uprisings that will happen when there is a financial panic. And
there will be one, maybe as early as this spring, when the dollar wont
get you a gumball.
Im not sure what the catalyst will be, but Ive
heard rumblings about a derivatives crisis as well as an oil embargo. I
dont know, thats not my department. But something is going to happen
to collapse the dollar, which has been in the works since the 1990′s.
Now if it does not happen as soon as this, its because there are
people, real patriots, who are working to prevent this, so its a fluid
dynamic. But that doesnt change the preparations.
And the preparations are these: DHS is prepositioning assets in
strategic areas near urban centers all across the country. Storage
depots. Armories. And even detainment facilities,
known as FEMA camps.
FEMA does not even know that the facilities are earmarked for detainment
by executive orders, at least not in the traditional sense they were
intended.
By the way, people drive by some of these armories everyday
without even giving them a second look. Commercial and business real
estate across the country are being bought up or leased for storage
purposes. Very low profile.
Anyway, I am hearing that the plan from on high is to let the chaos play
out for a while, making ordinary citizens beg for troops to be deployed
to restore order, but its all organized to make them appear as good
guys. Thats when the real head knocking will take place. Were talking
travel restrictions, which should no be a problem because gas will be
rationed or unavailable.
The TSA will be in charge of travel, or at
least be a big part of it. They will be commissioned, upgraded from
their current status.
They, I mean Jarrett and Obama as well as a few others in government,
are working to create a perfect storm too.
This is being timed to
coincide with new gun laws.
DH: New federal gun laws?
RB: Yes. Count on the criminalization to possess just about every gun
you can think of. Not only restrictions, but actual criminalization of
possessing a banned firearm.
I heard this directly from the highest of
my sources. Plans were made in the 90′s but were withheld. Now, its a
new day, a new time, and they are riding the wave of emotion from Sandy
Hook, which, by the way and as tragic as it was, well, it stinks to
high heaven. I mean there are many things wrong there, and first reports
are fast disappearing. The narrative is being changed.
Look, there is
something wrong with Sandy Hook, but if you write it, youll be called a
kook or worse.
DH: Sure
RB: But Sandy Hook, theres something very wrong there. But I am hearing
that wont be the final straw. There will be another if they think its
necessary.
DH: Another shooting?
RB: Yes.
DH: That would mean they are at least complicit.
RB: Well, thats one way of looking at it.
DH: Are they? Were they?
RB: Do your own research. Nothing I say, short of bringing you
photographs and documents will convince anyone, and even then, its like
[DELETED] in the wind.
DH: So
RB: So what Im telling you is that DHS, the TSA and certain, but not
all, law enforcement agencies are going to be elbow deep in riot control
in response to an economic incident.
At the same time or close to it,
gun confiscation will start. It will start on a voluntary basis using
federal registration forms, then an amnesty, then the kicking-in of
doors start.
Before or at the same time, you know all the talk of lists, you know,
the red and blue lists that everyone made fun of? Well they exist,
although I dont know about their colors. But there are lists of
political dissidents maintained by DHS.
Names are coordinated with the
executive branch, but you know what? They did not start with Obama. Theyve been around in one form or another for years.
The difference
though is that today, they are much more organized.
And Ill tell you
that the vocal opponents of the politics of
the global elite,
the
bankers, and the opponents of anything standing in their way, well, they
are on the top of the list of people to be handled.
DH: Handled?
RB: As the situations worsen, some might be given a chance to stop their
vocal opposition. Some will, others wont.
I suppose they are on
different lists. Others wont have that chance. By that time, though, it
will be chaos and people will be in full defensive mode. They will be
hungry, real hunger like weve never experienced before.
They will use
our hunger as leverage.
They will use medical care as leverage.
DH: Will this happen all at once?
RB: They hope to make it happen at the same time.
Big cities first, with
sections being set apart from the rest of the country. Then the rural
areas. There are two different plans for geographical considerations.
But it will all come together.
DH: Wait, this sounds way, way over the top. Are you telling me
[Interrupts]
RB: [Over talk/Unintelligible]
know who was selected or elected twice
now. You know who his associates are. And you are saying this is way
over the top? Dont forget what
Ayers said - you talked to
Larry Grathwohl. This guy is a revolutionary.
He does not want to transform
our country in the traditional sense. He will destroy it. And hes not
working alone. Hes not working for himself, either. He has his
handlers.
So dont think this is going to be a walk in the park, with
some type of attempt to rescue the country. Cloward-Piven. Alinsky.
Marx. All rolled into one.
And he wont need the rest of his four years
to do it.
DH: I need you to be clear. Lets go back again, I mean, to those who
speak out about whats happening.
RB: [Edit note: Obviously irritated] How much clearer do you want it?
The
Second Amendment will be gone, along with the first, at least
practically or operationally. The Constitution will be gone, suspended,
at least in an operational sense. Maybe they wont actually say that
they are suspending it, but will do it. Like saying the sky is purple
when its actually blue.
How many people will look a the sky and say
yeah, its purple? They see what they want to see.
So the DHS, working with other law enforcement organizations, especially
the TSA as it stands right now, will oversee the confiscation of assault
weapons, which includes all semi-automatic weapons following a period of
so-called amnesty.
It also includes shotguns that hold multiple rounds,
or have pistol grips. They will go after the high capacity magazines,
anything over, say 5 rounds.
They will also go after the ammunition, especially at the manufacturers
level. They will require a special license for certain weapons, and make
it impossible to own anything. More draconian than England. This is a
global thing too.
Want to hunt? What gives you the right to hunt their
animals? Sound strange? I hope so, but they believe they own the
animals. Do you understand now, how sick and twisted this is? Their
mentality?
The obvious intent is to disarm American citizens.
They will say that
well still be able to defend ourselves and go hunting, but even that
will be severely regulated. This is the part that they are still working
out, though. While the plans were made years ago, there is some argument
over the exact details.
I know that Napolitano, even with her support of
the agenda, would like to see this take place outside of an E.O.
[Executive Order] in favor of legislative action and even with
the United Nations
involvement.
DH: But UN involvement would still require legislative approval.
RB: Yes, but your still thinking normal - in normal terms. Stop thinking
about a normal situation. The country is divided, which is exactly where
Obama wants us to be.
We are as ideologically divided as we were during
the Civil War and that rift is growing every day.
Add in a crisis - and
economic crisis
- where
ATM and
EBT cards will stop working. Where bank
accounts will contain nothing but air. They are anticipating a
revolution and a civil war rolled into one (emphasis added by this
author).
Imagine when talk show hosts or Bloggers or some other malcontent gets
on the air or starts writing about the injustice of it all, and about
how Obama is the anti-Christ or something.
They will outlaw such talk or
writing as inciting the situation - they will make it illegal by saying
that it is causing people to die. The Republicans will go along with
everything as its - we have - a one party system. Two parties is an
illusion.
Its all so surreal to talk about but you see where this is
headed, right?
DH: Well, what about the lists?
RB: Back to that again, okay.
Why do you think
the NSA has surveillance
of all communications? To identify and stop terrorism? Okay, to be fair,
that is part of it, but not the main reason.
The federal agencies have
identified people who present a danger to them and their agendas. I
dont know if they are color coded like you mentioned, red blue purple
or peach mango or whatever, but they exist. In fact, each agency has
their own.
You know, why is it so [deleted] hard for people to get their
heads around the existence of lists with names of people who pose a
threat to their plans? The media made a big deal about Nixons enemies
list and everyone nodded and said yeah, that [deleted], but today?
Theyve been around for years and years.
DH: I think its because of the nature of the lists today. What do they
plan to do with their enemies?
RB: Go back to what Ayers said when, in the late 60′s? 70′s? I forget.
Anyway, he was serious.
But to some extent, the same thing that happened
before. They - the people on some of these lists - are under
surveillance, or at least some, and when necessary, some are approached
and made an offer.
Others, well, they can be made to undergo certain
training. Lets call it sensitivity training, except on a much different
level. Others, most that are the most visible and mainstream are safe
for the most part.
And do you want to know why? Its because they are in
the pockets of the very people we are talking about, but they might or
might not know it. Corporate sponsorship - follow the money. You know
the drill. You saw it happen before, with the birth certificate.
Its people that are just under the national radar but are effective.
They have to worry.
Those who have been publicly marginalized already
but continue to talk or write or post, they are in trouble. Its people
who wont sell out, who think that they can make a difference. Those are
the people who have to worry.
Think about recent deaths that everybody believes were natural or
suicides. Were they? People are too busy working their [butts] off to
put food on the table to give a damn about some guy somewhere who vapor
locks because of too many doughnuts and coffee and late nights. And it
seems plausible enough to happen.
This time, when everything collapses,
do you think they will care if it is a bullet or a heart attack that
takes out the opposition? [Deleted] no.
DH: Thats disturbing. Do you
[interrupts]
RB: Think about the Oklahoma City bombing in 95.
Remember how Clinton
blamed that on talk radio, or at least in part. Take what happened then
and put it in context of today. Then multiply the damnation by 100, and
you will begin to understand where this is going. People like Rush and Hannity have a narrow focus of political theater. Theyll still be up
and running during all of this to allow for the appearance of normal.
Stay within the script, comrade.
But as far as the others, they have certain plans. And these plans are
becoming more transparent. They are getting bolder. They are pushing
lies, and the bigger the lie, the easier it is to sell to the people.
They will even try to sell a sense of normalcy as things go absolutely
crazy and break down. It will be surreal. And some will believe it,
think that its only happening in certain places, and we can draw
everything back once the dust settles.
But when it does, this place will
not be the same.
DH: Will there be resistance within the ranks of law enforcement? You
know, will some say they wont go along with the plan, like the Oath
Keepers?
RB: Absolutely. But they will not only be outnumbered, but outgunned
- literally.
The whole objective is to bring in outside forces to deal
with the civil unrest that will happen in America. And where does their
allegiance lie? Certainly not to Sheriff Bob. Or you or me.
During all of this, and youve got to remember that the dollar collapse
is a big part of this, our country is going to have to be redone. Ive
seen - personally - a map of North America without borders. Done this
year. The number 2015 was written across the top, and I believe that was
meant as a year.
Along with this map - in the same area where this was
- was another map showing the United States cut up into sectors. Im not
talking about what people have seen on the Internet, but something
entirely different. Zones. And
a big star on the city of Denver.
Sound like conspiracy stuff on the Internet? Yup. But maybe they were
right. It sure looks that way. It will read that way if you decide to
write about this. Good luck with that.
Anyway, the country seemed to be
split into sectors, but not the kind shown on the Internet. Different.
DH: What is the context of that?
RB: Across the bottom of this was written economic sectors. It looked
like a work in progress, so I cant tell you any more than that. From
the context I think it has to do with the collapse of the dollar.
DH: Why would DHS have this? I mean, it seems almost contrived, doesnt
it?
RB: Not really, when you consider the bigger picture.
But wait before we
go off into that part. I need to tell you about
Obamacare, you know, the
new health care coming up. It plays a big part - a huge [deleted] part
in the immediate reshaping of things.
DH: How so?
RB: It creates a mechanism of centralized control over people. Thats
the intent of this monster of a bill, not affordable health care.
And it
will be used to identify gun owners. Think your health records are
private? Have you been to the doctor lately? Asked about owning a gun?
Why do you think they ask, do you think they care about your safety?
Say
yes to owning a gun and your information is shared with another agency,
and ultimately, you will be identified as a security risk. The records
will be matched with other agencies.
You think that they are simply relying on gun registration forms? This
is part of data collection that people dont get. Oh, and dont even
think about getting a script for some mood enhancement drug and being
able to own a gun.
Ayers and Dohrn are having the times of their lives seeing things
theyve worked for all of their adult lives actually coming to pass. Oh,
before I forget, look at the recent White House visitor logs.
DH: Why? Where did that come from?
RB: Unless they are redacted, you will see the influence of Ayers. Right
now. The Weather Underground has been reborn. So has their agenda.
DH: Eugenics? Population control?
RB: Yup. And re-education camps. But trust me, you write about this,
youll be called a kook. Its up to you, its your reputation, not mine.
And speaking about that, you do know that this crew is using the
Internet to ruin people, right? They are paying people to infiltrate
discussion sites and forums to call people like you idiots. Show me the
proof they say.
Why doesnt your source come forward? If he knows so
much, why not go to Fox or the media? To them, if its not broadcast on
CNN, its not real. Well, theyve got it backwards.
Very little
on the
news is real. The stock market, the economy, the last presidential
polls, very little is real.
But this crew is really internet savvy. Theyve got a lot of people they
pay to divert issues on forums, to mock people, to marginalize them.
They know what theyre doing. People think theyll take sites down - hack them. Why do that when they are more effective to infiltrate the
discussion?
Think
about the birth certificate, I mean the eligibility
problem of Obama. Perfect example.
DH: How soon do you see things taking place?
RB: They already are in motion. If youre looking for a date I cant
tell you. Remember, the objectives are the same, but plans, well, they
adapt. They exploit. Watch how this fiscal cliff thing plays out. This
is the run-up to the next beg economic event.
I cant give you a date. I can tell you to watch things this spring.
Start with the inauguration and go from there. Watch the metals, when
they dip. It will be a good indication that things are about to happen.
I got that little tidbit from my friend at [REDACTED].
