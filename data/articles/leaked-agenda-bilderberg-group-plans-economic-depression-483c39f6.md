On the eve of the
2009 Bilderberg Group conference, which is
due to be held May 14-17 at the 5 star Nafsika Astir Palace Hotel in
Vouliagmeni, Greece, investigative reporter Daniel Estulin has
uncovered shocking details of what the elitists plan to do with the economy
over the course of the next year.
The Bilderberg Group meeting is an annual confab of around 150 of the
worlds most influential powerbrokers in government, industry, banking,
media, academia and the military-industrial complex.
The secretive group operates under Chatham
House rules, meaning that no details of what is discussed can ever be
leaked to the media, despite editors of the worlds biggest newspapers, the
Washington Post, the New York Times and the Financial Times,
being present at the meeting.
According to Estulins sources, which have been proven highly accurate in
the past, Bilderberg is divided on whether to put into motion,
Either a prolonged, agonizing depression
that dooms the world to decades of stagnation, decline and poverty
or
an intense-but-shorter depression that paves the way for a new
sustainable economic world order, with less sovereignty but more
efficiency.
The information takes on added weight when one
considers the fact that Estulins previous economic forecasts, which were
based on leaks from the same sources, have proven deadly accurate.
Estulin correctly predicted the housing crash
and the 2008 financial meltdown as a result of what his sources inside
Bilderberg told him the elite were planning based on what was said at their
2006 meeting in Canada and the
2007 conference in Turkey.
Details of the economic agenda were contained in a pre-meeting booklet being
handed out to Bilderberg members.
On a more specific note, Estulin warns that
Bilderberg are fostering a false picture of economic recovery, suckering
investors into ploughing their money back into the stock market again only
to later unleash another massive downturn which will create massive
losses and searing financial pain in the months ahead,
according to a Canada Free Press report.
According to Estulin, Bilderberg is assuming that U.S. unemployment figures
will reach around 14% by the end of the year, almost doubling the current
official figure of 8.1 per cent.
Estulins sources also tell him that Bilderberg will again attempt to push
for the enactment of the
Lisbon Treaty, a key centerpiece of the
agenda to fully entrench a federal EU superstate, by forcing the Irish to
vote again on the document in September/October despite having rejected
it already, along with other European nations, in national referendums.
One of their concerns is addressing and
neutralizing the anti-Lisbon treaty movement called 'Libertas'
led by Declan Ganley. One of the Bilderberger planned moves is to use a
whispering campaign in the US media suggested that Ganley is being
funded by arms dealers in the US linked to the US military, reports CFP.
Daniel Estulin, Jim Tucker, and
other sources who have infiltrated Bilderberg meetings in the past have
routinely provided information about the Bilderberg agenda that later plays
out on the world stage, proving that the organization is not merely a
talking shop as debunkers claim, but an integral planning forum for the
new world order agenda.
Indeed, just last month Belgian viscount and current Bilderberg-chairman
Ã‰tienne Davignon (below image) bragged that
Bilderberg helped create the Euro by
first introducing the policy agenda for a single currency in the early
1990s.
Bilderbergs agenda for a European federal
superstate and a single currency likely goes back even further.
A BBC investigation uncovered documents (listen
below audio) from the early Bilderberg meetings which confirmed that the
European Union was a brainchild of Bilderberg:
-
In spring 2002, when war hawks in the
Bush administration were pushing
for a summer invasion of Iraq, Bilderbergers expressed their desire
for a delay and the attack was not launched until March the
following year.
-
In 2006, Estulin predicted that the U.S.
housing market would be allowed to soar before the bubble was
cruelly popped, which is exactly what transpired.
-
In 2008, Estulin predicted that
Bilderberg were creating the conditions for a financial calamity,
which is exactly what began a few months later with the collapse of
Lehman Brothers.
-
Bilderberg has routinely flexed its
muscles in establishing its role as kingmaker. The
organization routinely selects presidential candidates as well as
running mates and prime ministers.
-
Bill Clinton and Tony Blair
were both groomed by the secretive organization in the early 1990s
before rising to prominence.
-
Barack Obamas running mate
Joe Biden was selected by Bilderberg luminary James A. Johnson,
and John Kerrys 2004 running mate John Edwards was also
anointed by the group after he gave a glowing speech at the
conference in 2004. Bilderberg attendees even broke house rules to
applaud Edwards at the end of a speech he gave to the elitists about
American politics. The choice of Edwards was shocking to media
pundits who had fully expected Dick Gephardt to secure the position.
The New York Post even reported that Gephardt had been chosen
and Kerry-Gephardt stickers were being placed on campaign vehicles
before being removed when Edwards was announced as Kerrys number
two.
-
A 2008 Portuguese newspaper report
highlighted the fact that Pedro Santana Lopes and Jose
Socrates attended the 2004 meeting in Stresa, Italy before both
going on to become Prime Minster of Portugal.
-
Several key geopolitical decisions were
made at last years Bilderberg meeting in Washington DC, again
emphasizing the fact that the confab is far more than an informal
get-together.
As we reported at the time, Bilderberg were
concerned that the price of oil was accelerating too fast after it hit $150
a barrel and wanted to ensure that oil prices would probably begin to
decline.
This is exactly what happened in the latter half
of 2008 as oil again sunk below $50 a barrel.
We were initially able to predict the rapid rise
in oil prices in 2005 when oil was at $40, because Bilderberg had called for
prices to rise during that years meeting in Munich. During the conference
in Germany,
Henry Kissinger told his fellow
attendees that the elite had resolved to ensure that oil prices would double
over the course of the next 12-24 months, which is exactly what happened.
Also at last years meeting, former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice formalized plans to sign a treaty on installing a U.S. radar base
in the Czech Republic with Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
Rice was joined at the meeting by Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who
reportedly encouraged EU globalists to get behind an attack on Iran. Low and
behold, days later the EU threatened Iran with sanctions if it did not
suspend its nuclear enrichment program.
There was also widespread speculation that
Hillary
Clinton and Barack Obamas secret meeting,
which was accomplished with the aid of cloak and dagger tactics like
locking journalists on an airplane to keep them from tracking the two down,
took place at the Bilderberg meeting in DC.
It remains to be seen what kind of mainstream media press coverage
Bilderberg 2009 will be afforded because, despite the proven track record of
Bilderberg having a central role in influencing subsequent geopolitical and
financial world events, and despite last years meeting being held in
Washington DC, the U.S. corporate media oversaw an almost universal blackout
of reporting on the conference, its attendees, and what was discussed.
Once again, it will be left to the alternative media to fill the vacuum and
educate the people on exactly what the globalists have planned for us over
the coming year.
