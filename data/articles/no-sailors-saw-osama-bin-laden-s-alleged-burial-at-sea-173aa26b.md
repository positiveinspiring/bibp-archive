More than a year after Navy SEALs supposedly
killed former CIA asset
Osama bin Laden, a FOIA by the
Associated Press has produced emails revealing that no American sailors
aboard the USS Carl Vinton witnessed the terrorists burial at sea.
The heavily redacted emails are said to be the
first public disclosure of government information about the undocumented
assassination.
An email supposedly sent by a Navy officer
claims Osama bin Laden was washed, wrapped in a white sheet, and then placed
in a weighted bag, according to the
Daily Mail.
Another email allegedly sent by Vintons public
affairs officer claims only a small group of the ships leadership was
informed of the burial.
A military officer read prepared religious
remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. After
the words were complete, the body was placed on a prepared flat board,
tipped up, whereupon the deceaseds body slid into the sea, Adm.
Charles Gaouette said in the email.
Recipients of the email included Adm. Mike
Mullen, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. James
Mattis, top officer at U.S. Central Command.
The Defense Department previously said it did
not have any photographs or video to support its claim the SEALs killed the
al-Qaeda leader. It also admitted there were no images taken of Bin Ladens
body on the Vinton.
The Pentagon does not have a death certificate,
autopsy report or results of DNA identification tests for bin Laden, or any
pre-raid materials discussing how the government planned to dispose of bin
Ladens body if he were killed, the Daily Mail reports.
In May, 2011, the
Obama
administration mulled releasing
photographs purportedly showing the body of Bin Laden with,
a massive head wound above his left eye
where he took bullet (sic), with brains and blood visible.
No such photos were ever produced.
We are going to do everything we can to
make sure that nobody has any basis to try to deny that we got Osama bin
Laden,
John Brennan, Obamas counterterrorism adviser, said following the
alleged assassination.
Brennan said the government will,
share what we can because we want to make
sure that not only the American people but the world understand exactly
what happened.
Despite a complete lack of evidence,
the government and
the corporate media now routinely insist
Obama
ordered the military to kill Osama bin Laden at a compound in
Pakistan.
Former State Department official
Steve Pieczenik told Alex Jones last May that the staged
assassination was nothing more than "American theater of the
absurd and a photo supposedly showing members of the Obama administration
watching a live video feed of the assassination (above image) was
fabricated:
In 2011, Dr. Pieczenik described
how even
the photo released of White House staff purportedly viewing
the bin Laden
raid was a hoax.
Insider Exposes...
Bin Laden Death Book Hoax
August 24, 2012
from
Infowars Website
A new book, allegedly put out by a member of the
Navy Seal Team 6 outfit that allegedly raided Osama bin Ladens headquarters
in Abbottabad, Pakistan, is causing major uproar.
The book,
No Easy Day - The Autobiography of a Navy Seal,
claims to give a firsthand account of the raid by one of the Seals who
actually witnessed the death of bin Laden.
The publisher, Dutton, a Penguin boutique
imprint, would have us believe the book was not vetted by the Pentagon.
Also,
Fox News claimed they received confirmation that the authors name is
actually Matt Bissonnette, instead of the pen name Mark Owen,
and that the Department of Defense is supposedly pissed that the book has
even been released.
On the contrary, as weve witnessed recently
with the arrest and detainment of Brandon Raub, an unapproved publication
would likely warrant a full-scale assault on its author.
The fact that this hasnt happened should be
proof enough that the book has been released under false pretenses and that
its dissemination of disinformation is intentional.
Exposing the Hoax
Infowars has maintained for years that bin Laden died in 2002 and that his
corpse would be dragged out at the most politically expedient moment. This
has most definitely been the case.
Yesterday, Alex interviewed Dr. Steve
Pieczenik, a Harvard trained psychiatrist with international relations
skills from M.I.T. and history working as a crisis and hostage negotiator
for the Department of State spanning four different presidential
administrations.
In 2002,
Dr. Pieczenik revealed on the Alex Jones Show that Osama bin Laden had
actually died that same year, and that a top general had even told him
directly that 9/11 was a false flag operation, a statement that he would
gladly make in front of a grand jury.
Last year
we wrote,
Back in April 2002
Pieczenik told the Alex
Jones Show that Bin Laden had already been dead for months, and that
the government was waiting for the most politically expedient time to
roll out his corpse.
Pieczenik would be in a position to know,
having personally met Bin Laden and worked with him during the proxy war
against the Soviets in Afghanistan back in the early 80â€²s.
Dr. Pieczenik went on to explain that a
physician he knew had treated bin Laden for Marfan syndrome, a degenerative
disease with no cure:
[He died] Not because special forces had
killed him, but because as a physician I had known that the CIA
physicians had treated him and it was on the intelligence roster that he
had marfan syndrome
He died of marfan syndrome, Bush junior knew
about it, the intelligence community knew about it.
Dr. Pieczenik is appalled at the perpetuation of
the fabled Seal Team 6 raid.
He says it endangers the lives of those men and
women who serve, and paints a target especially on Special Forces teams:
Every time you say we killed Osama bin
Ladin by some hot shot make believe seal team six, some Special Forces
guy is going to be taken out because some real terrorist is really gonna
kill him to make a point that Special forces are not that special.
As we have
exhaustively covered, Osama bin Laden (AKA Tim Osman)
was a CIA operative and has been dead for a number of years.
By parading bin Ladens image on every major
news station in the days following the 9/11 attack, Americans were subjected
to a version of the two-minute hate, the mandatory video session
envisioned in
George Orwells
1984 that taught society exactly who
to detest.
Bin Ladens picture was posted on every media
outlet for weeks, feverishly conditioning everyone to accept the bearded
cave-dweller as our enemy. They took a page almost directly from Orwell in
producing an enemy that could neither be found, nor slowed.
Undermines the
intelligence of the American People
The books publication is a slap in the face of the American people, and if
published under the circumstances described, should be a direct violation of
State Department protocol, deeming a raid of the authors home, or, at the
very least, a court martial.
The books release signifies the governments
latest effort to quell dissent over the 9/11 issue, doing more harm than
good to the American people and further weaving a tangled web of lies
designed to cover-up the truth behind bin Ladens death.
With the book beginning to top best-seller lists
on Amazon.com and Barnes&Noble.com, this latest propaganda is geared to put
to rest any dissenting voices that call the raid a hoax.
The mere fact that this book was released and
that its author has not been reprimanded is indeed a tell-tale sign that the
book is nothing more than a fabricated work of fiction.
The propaganda is not
over
As if placing nails on the coffin, in December the film Zero Dark Thirty
is set to be released. Its aim will be to further propagandize the fabled
raid and attempt to give further credence to the fabrication.
