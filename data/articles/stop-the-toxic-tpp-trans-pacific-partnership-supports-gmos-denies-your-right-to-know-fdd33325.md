How does
defeating one of the biggest fraudulent trade agreements supported by,
...and the
politicians they own sound to you?
Just in case you aren't familiar with the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP
or
TAFTA),
they are huge multinational 'trade' deals written by corporations, which are
being pushed by the White House and many of our politicians in order to
support the ongoing monopoly of our food supply.
They are
toxic, just like the products these companies sell, but you can stop them
with a twitter storm and grass-roots activism.
If you aren't on Twitter, you can also sign
a petition or post to one of many Facebook pages,
telling Congress and our government that you don't support trade agreements
which ravage the environment, kill farmer's wages, and support toxic GM
agricultural practices.
The TPP is simply undemocratic. It threatens all
our founding fathers worked to set up for the Republic.
If the TPP passed, it would supersede and
undermine U.S. federal and state laws, including FDA and Department of
Agriculture rules and regulations. It would compel sales of globalized
commodified food of uncertain and likely damaging origin, dangerous
pesticides, and untested genetic and molecular content on consumers.
Your choice will be gone, and even a meaningful
glance at a label will be either pointless or will deliberately misinform
consumers. As many of us suspected all
along, labeling is just part of the problem.
There will be no alternative to your lack of
choice under TPP.
"...if the
secret Trans-Pacific Partnership currently being negotiated in secret
sessions among the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim
countries is passed.
The Obama
administration, guided by Monsanto and other agribusiness and
pharmaceutical companies, is pushing for rules that put corporate greed
ahead of food safety and consumers' right to know what we're eating."
You can
also pass around
this
information, which makes the TPP more
transparent.
Don't let Monsanto, et al, run over your rights
even more than they already have. If you don't want to eat GMOs without even
having the knowledge you've done so, this trade agreement must be stopped.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership Means...
GMOs in Your
Food

Your ability to control what you eat, or even
know what is in the food you eat, will be gone if the secret
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
currently being negotiated in secret sessions among the United States and 11
other Pacific Rim countries is passed.
The
Obama
administration, guided
by Monsanto and other agribusiness and
pharmaceutical companies, is pushing for rules that put corporate greed
ahead of food safety and consumers' right to know what we're eating.
The text of the TPP is secret - not even members of Congress are allowed to
see it - but hundreds of corporate representatives are helping to write the
text.
Part of this plan involves companies like
Monsanto inducing the U.S. to put their preferred intellectual property,
environmental, food safety and capital-markets laws into force.
This will benefit only Big Ag and
Big Pharma by allowing the cultivation of
genetically modified organisms in all TPP countries and will also act to
prevent mandatory GMO labeling in order to integrate GMOs into the food
supply while removing traceability and accountability.
As a result, "inconvenient" U.S. environmental,
food safety and labeling laws and rules will be overruled by Monsanto under
the TPP without a direct democratic vote on any issue.
The TPP, if approved by Congress, will supersede and subvert U.S. federal
and state laws, including
the FDA and the Department of Agriculture
rules and regulations, and force globalized commodified food of uncertain
and unsafe origin, dangerous pesticides and untested genetic and molecular
content on consumers.
Choice will be gone, and even a meaningful
glance at a label will be either pointless or will deliberately misinform
consumers.
There will be no alternative to your lack of
choice under TPP.
Many GMOs exist to Sell Monsanto Pesticides
A primary purpose
of GMOs, which have lower yields per
hectare than traditional methods of agriculture, is to force farmers to buy
more Roundup, a pesticide made by Monsanto.
Increased use of Roundup has pollutes streams,
aquifers, drinking water, encouraged "super weeds" to develop genetic
resistance
to glyphosate, and posed uncertain health
risks to humans and others.
Genetically engineered foods have not been
adequately tested, nor have the Monsanto pesticides that are sold along with
GMO seeds.
The TPP will result in increased pesticide use,
environmental and food contamination.
No Regulation
The FDA does not require safety assessments of
GMO foods and does not review all GMO products hitting the market. FDA
guidelines are entirely voluntary and the patent holders themselves
determine whether their products "warrant analytical or toxicological
tests."
Corporations will Control Biotechnology Law and
Standards
Under the TPP, a world market concentrated in
the hands of a few multinational corporations will supplant the democratic
process.
Pressure from U.S. corporations in previous
bilateral trade negotiations has already caused,
-
India
-
China
-
Vietnam
-
Bangladesh,
...to back down or remove GMO import
restrictions.
Big Ag has also demanded the U.S. government use the proposed TPP to force other countries such as,
-
New Zealand
-
Australia
-
Japan
-
Peru
-
Chile
-
Malaysia
-
the Philippines,
...to allow field testing of GMOs and removing
labeling restrictions that disclose GMO content.
The TPP promotes Monopoly Power
The U.S. biotechnology lobby led by Monsanto is
pushing for no GMO labeling.
"It is well known," a diplomatic cable
released by WikiLeaks reports, "that Monsanto does not like New
Zealand's genetically modified organism regulations," which the U.S.
government has actively lobbied against on Monsanto's behalf.
Standardization
All TPP members will be required to standardize
sanitary measures.
This does not mean the best or safest standard,
but the one that will commodify food the most to remove production and
labeling standards disclosing GMOs, country of origin, and compliance with
environmental, safety and minimum-wage laws.
The race to the bottom will mean that the lowest
food safety and environmental standards will be the standards adopted -
anything stricter would be eliminated as "barrier" to "free trade" and would
constitute an illegal "confiscation" of corporate profits.
Investor-State Provisions
Although a handful of multinational corporations
are already attempting control the world's food supply, the TPP would
accelerate this process.
The "investor-state provision" contained in TPP
- requirements that corporate profits be given the highest priority in any
dispute with a rule, law or regulation - would enable multinational
corporations to challenge the laws and rules of signatory governments
directly.
Any regulation that a multinational corporation
claims will reduce the profits it expects from an "investment" will be
challenged in secret arbitration tribunal controlled by corporate elites and
in which lawyers who represent corporations in investor-state disputes sit
in judgment!
An example under NAFTA is ;pharmaceutical corporation Eli Lilly's suit
against the Canadian government to invalidate Canada's standards for
granting drug patents.
Eli Lilly claims the denial of a patent is an
illegal "expropriation of its property rights" under NAFTA. The proposed
rules of TPP are even more tilted in favor of multinational corporations
than are the rules of NAFTA.
The TPP will allow more of these lawsuits that
can invalidate federal and state regulations, with no restrictions on what
constitutes an "investment."
Increased Environmental Pollution is a
Consequence of the TPP
Already weak U.S. environmental and
consumer-safety laws would be further weakened.
Some GMO foods are already allowed in some TPP
countries but not yet allowed in the U.S. because federal regulators have
not determined that these GMO foods are "safe" for human consumption. Once
the
U.S. signs the TPP, the authority to regulate or prohibit GMO foods not
demonstrated as safe will be undermined by the ability of multinational
corporations to invalidate host country's environmental- and consumer-safety
laws and regulations.
The TPP means unknown Environmental
Cross-Contamination
One of the 12 countries in TPP negotiations,
Vietnam, has some of the last untouched rainforest on earth.
Allowing GMO crops will result in clear-cutting
much of that forest to grow GMO crops upon principles of economies of scale.
The risk of cross-pollination of GMO pollen with wild flora will occur and
have unknown consequences on the plants and animals that eat them in fragile
ecosystems.
Already, in the U.S. and Canada, farmers report
contamination of their crops from GMO strains being used on neighboring
lands.
Incredibly, Monsanto then sues these farmers
for illegal use of their patents!
Food Security Decreases under the TPP
Monsanto already controls about 90 percent of
the global GMO seed market - giving it a tremendous monopoly power to
control supply and set prices.
The monoculture caused by the standardization of
crops from GMO seeds will devastate rural communities, biodiversity and the
environment, and leave GMO crops immunologically exposed to crop viruses.
Under the TPP, Monsanto would be allowed to add
other crops such as alfalfa to the line of its "Roundup Ready" products -
these are crops that are genetically engineered to be able to withstand
heavy application of Monsanto's Roundup pesticides.
As insects become increasingly immune to
Roundup, farmers drastically increase the amount of Roundup pesticides they
apply to their lands.
This not only degrades the soil, it send more
pesticide runoff into groundwater and downstream rivers, creating
environmental devastation.
TPP will Replace Family Farms with Corporate
Agribusiness
The elimination of protective tariffs will drive
small farmers and peasants off their land because they will not be able to
pay the finance costs of GMO seeds or sell non-"standardized" crops and this
will destroy heirloom brands and biodiversity.
Access to "local grown" food will end. Big Ag
has already started a "land grab" to consolidate its control over both
production and distribution.
"Free-trade" agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),
and the Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA)
being negotiated between the U.S. and the European Union, will ensure that a
handful of corporations, led by Monsanto, will obtain their goal of
controlling the world's food.
President Obama - Shilling for Monsanto
You've probably heard that President
Obama
appointed Monsanto's former vice-president for public policy as deputy
commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and that he signed the
Monsanto Protection Act.
But did you know that he appointed (Islam
Siddiqui) a lobbyist
for
Croplife, an industry group representing Monsanto, as his chief
agriculture negotiator in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the
branch of government negotiating TPP and TAFTA, a TPP-style agreement with
the European Union?
The Obama administration is not only driving TPP
and TAFTA, but is calling on Congress to vote to grant the President Fast
Track Trade Promotion Authority.
According to Public Citizen's Global Trade
Watch,
"'Fast Track' is the process that gives the
executive branch the authority to negotiate and write trade agreements
and delegates away Congress' constitutional power to set the terms of
U.S. trade policy.
Fast Track creates special rules for
considering trade agreements by allowing the executive branch to sign an
agreement before Congress votes on it and only gives Congress 90 days to
vote on the trade deal.
Under Fast Track, the president is
authorized to negotiate trade agreements with foreign countries without
consulting Congress or state legislators.
After the executive branch locks down the
terms of the deal and writes the implementing legislation, Congress is
only permitted a yes or no vote, while states are virtually left out of
the process.
Thus, state and congressional officials
elected to represent the public interest have no role in the process but
to approve or disapprove the whole package."
Thus, Congress will be stripped of the power to
amend TPP to remove it's most egregious pro-Monsanto, anti-consumer
provisions.
WHAT YOU CAN DO
Call and email your Congressional Representative and demand that he or she
publicly commit to vote against Fast Track Trade Promotion Authority.
Let your Rep know that you want Congress to
maintain its power to amend trade agreements in order to remove or modify
provisions that weaken food safety standards. Let them know that safe food
is more important than Monsanto's greed!
