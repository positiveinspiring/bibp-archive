Coming events cast their shadows forward.
Goethe
What is to stop U.S. banks and their customers from creating $1 trillion,
$10 trillion or even $50 trillion on their computer keyboards to buy up all
the bonds and stocks in the world, along with all the land and other assets
for sale, in the hope of making capital gains and pocketing the arbitrage
spreads by debt leveraging at less than 1% interest cost?
This is the game
that is being played today.
The outflow of dollar credit into foreign
markets in pursuit of this strategy has bid up asset prices and foreign
currencies, enabling speculators to pay off their U.S. positions in cheaper
dollars, keeping for themselves the currency shift as well as the arbitrage
interest-rate margin.
Finance has become the new mode of warfare - without the expense of military
overhead and an occupation against unwilling hosts. It is a competition in
credit creation to buy global real estate and natural resources,
infrastructure, bonds and corporate stock ownership.
Who needs an army when
you can obtain monetary wealth and asset appropriation simply by financial
means? Victory promises to go to the economy whose
banking system can create
the most credit, using an army of computer keyboards to appropriate the
worlds resources.
The main hurdle confronting this financial Lebensraum drive is that it
requires the central banks of targeted economies to accept electronic dollar
credit of depreciating international worth in payment for national assets.
U.S. officials demonize countries suffering these dollar inflows as
aggressive,
currency manipulators for what Treasury Secretary
Tim Geithner
calls competitive non-appreciation, in which countries block their
currencies from rising in value. [1]
Oscar Wilde would have struggled to find a
more convoluted term for other countries protecting themselves from raiders
trying to force up their currencies to make enormous predatory fortunes.
Competitive non-appreciation sounds like conspiratorial non-suicide.
These countries simply are trying to protect their currencies from
arbitrageurs and speculators flooding their financial markets with dollars,
sweeping their currencies up and down to extract billions of dollars from
their central banks.
Their central banks are being forced to choose between passively letting
these inflows push up their exchange rates - thereby pricing their exports
out of foreign markets - or recycling these inflows into U.S. Treasury bills
yielding only 1% with declining exchange value. (Longer-term bonds risk a
price decline if U.S interest rates should rise.)
The euphemism for flooding economies with credit is quantitative easing.
The
Federal Reserve is pumping a tidal wave of liquidity and reserves into
the financial system to reduce interest rates, ostensibly to enable banks to
earn their way out of negative equity resulting from the bad loans made
during the real estate bubble. This liquidity is spilling over to foreign
economies, increasing their exchange rates.
Joseph Stiglitz recently
acknowledged that instead of helping the global recovery, the flood of
liquidity from the Fed and the European Central Bank is causing chaos in
foreign exchange markets.
The irony is that the Fed is creating all this
liquidity with the hope that it will revive the American economy... Its
doing nothing for the American economy, but its causing chaos over the rest
of the world. [2]
What U.S. quantitative easing is achieving is to drive the dollar down and
other currencies up, much to the applause of currency speculators enjoying
quick and easy gains.
Yet it is to defend this system that U.S. diplomats
and bank lobbyists are threatening to derail the international financial
system and plunge world trade into anarchy if other countries do not agree
to a replay of the
1985 Plaza Accord,
as a possible framework for
engineering an orderly decline in the dollar and avoiding potentially
destabilizing trade fights. [3]
The Plaza Accord derailed Japans economy by raising its exchange rate while
lowering interest rates, flooding its economy with enough credit to inflate
a real estate bubble.
IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn was more
realistic.
Im not sure the mood is to have a new Plaza or Louvre accord,
he said at a press briefing on the eve of the IMF meetings in Washington.
We are in a different time today.
Acknowledging the need for some element
of capital controls [to] be put in place, he added that in view of U.S.
insistence on open, unprotected capital markets, The idea that there is an
absolute need in a globalized world to work together may lose some steam.
[4]
At issue is how long nations will succumb to the speculative dollar glut.
The world is being forced to choose between subordination to U.S. economic
nationalism or an interim of financial anarchy.
Nations are responding by
seeking to create an alternative international financial system, risking an
anarchic transition period in order to create a fairer world economy.
Re-inflating the financial bubble rather than writing down debts
The global financial system already has seen one long and unsuccessful
experiment in
quantitative easing in Japans carry trade.
After its
financial and property bubble burst in 1990, the Bank of Japan sought to
enable its banks to earn their way out of negative equity by supplying
them with low-interest credit for them to lend out. Japans recession left
little demand at home, so its banks developed the carry trade: lending at a
low interest rate to arbitrageurs to buy higher-yielding securities.
Iceland, for example, was paying 15%.
So yen were borrowed to convert into
dollars, euros, Icelandic kroner and Chinese renminbi to buy government
bonds, private-sector bonds, stocks, currency options and other financial
intermediation. Not much of this funding was used to finance new capital
formation. It was purely financial in character - extractive, not
productive.
By 2006 the United States and Europe were experiencing a financial and real
estate bubble of its own.
And after it burst in 2008, they did what Japans
banks did after 1990. Seeking to help U.S. banks work their way out of
negative equity, the Federal Reserve flooded the economy with credit. The
aim was to provide more liquidity, in the hope that banks would lend more to
domestic borrowers.
The economy would borrow its way out of debt,
re-inflating asset prices for real estate, stocks and bonds so as to deter
home foreclosures and the ensuing wipeout of collateral on bank balance
sheets.
Quantitative easing subsidizes U.S. capital flight, pushing up non-dollar
currency exchange rates
Quantitative easing may not have set out to disrupt the global trade and
financial system or start a round of currency speculation, but that is the
result of the Feds decision in 2008 to keep unplayable high debts from
defaulting by re-inflating U.S. real estate and financial markets.
The aim
is to pull home ownership out of negative equity, rescuing the banking
systems balance sheets and thus saving the government from having to
indulge in a
TARP II, which looks politically impossible given the mood of
most Americans.
The announced objective is not materializing. Instead of increasing their
loans against U.S. real estate, consumers or businesses, banks are still
reducing their exposure. This is why the U.S. savings rate is jumping. The
saving that is reported (up from zero to 3% of GDP) is taking the form of
paying down debts taken out in the past, not building up liquid funds.
Just
as hoarding diverts revenue away from being spent on goods and services, so
debt repayment shrinks spendable income.
Why then would banks lend more
under conditions where a third of U.S. homes already are in negative equity
and the economy is shrinking as a result of debt deflation?
Mr. Bernanke proposes to solve this problem by injecting another $1 trillion
of liquidity over the coming year, on top of the $2 trillion in new Federal
Reserve credit already created during 2009-10.
This quantitative easing has
been sent abroad, mainly to
the BRIC countries: Brazil, Russia, India and
China.
Recent research at the International Monetary Fund has shown
conclusively that G4 monetary easing has in the past transferred itself
almost completely to the emerging economies
since 1995, the stance of
monetary policy in Asia has been almost entirely determined by the monetary
stance of the G4 - the US, Eurozone, Japan and China - led by the Fed.
According to the IMF,
equity prices in Asia and Latin America generally
rise when excess liquidity is transferred from the G4 to the emerging
economies. [5]
This is what has led gold prices to surge and investors to move
out of the dollar since early September, prompting other nations to protect
their economies.
Speculative credit from U.S., Japanese and British banks to buy bonds,
stocks and currencies in the BRIC and Third World countries is a
self-feeding expansion, pushing up their currencies as well as their asset
prices. Their central banks end up with these dollars, whose value falls as
measured in their own local currencies.
U.S. officials say that this is all
part of the free market.
It is not good for the world for the burden of
solving this broader problem
to rest on the shoulders of the United
States, [6] insisted Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner on Wednesday, as if the
spillover from U.S. quantitative easing and deregulation was not promoting
the speculative dollar glut.
So other countries are obliged to solve the problem on their own.
Japan is
holding down its exchange rate by selling yen and buying U.S. Treasury bonds
in the face of its carry trade being unwound as arbitrageurs pay back the
yen they earlier borrowed to buy higher-yielding but increasingly risky
sovereign debt from countries such as Greece.
These paybacks have pushed up
the yens exchange rate by 12% against the dollar so far during 2010,
prompting Bank of Japan governor Masaaki Shirakawa to announce on Tuesday,
October 5, that Japan had no choice but to,
spend 5 trillion yen ($60
billion) to buy government bonds, corporate IOUs, real-estate investment
trust funds and exchange-traded funds - the latter two a departure from past
practice. [7]
This sterilization of unwanted inflows is what the United States has
criticized China for doing.
China has tried more normal ways to recycle its
trade surplus, by seeking out U.S. companies to buy. But Congress would not
let
CNOOC buy into U.S. oil refinery capacity a few years ago, and the
Canadian government is now being urged to block Chinas attempt to purchase
its potash resources. Such protectionism leaves little option for China and
other countries except to hold their currencies stable by purchasing U.S.
and European government bonds.
The problem for all countries today is that as presently structured, the
global financial system rewards speculation and makes it difficult for
central banks to maintain stability without recycling dollar inflows to the
U.S. Government, which enjoys a near monopoly in providing the worlds
central bank reserves by running budget and balance-of-payments deficits.
As
noted earlier, arbitrageurs obtain a twofold gain: the margin between
Brazils nearly 12% yield on its long-term government bonds and the cost of
U.S. credit (1%), plus the foreign-exchange gain resulting from the fact
that the outflow from dollars into reals has pushed up the reals exchange
rate some 30% - from R$2.50 at the start of 2009 to R$1.75 last week.
Taking
into account the ability to leverage $1 million of ones own equity
investment to buy $100 million of foreign securities, the rate of return is
3000% since January 2009.
Brazil has been more a victim than a beneficiary of what is euphemized as a
capital inflow. The inflow of foreign money has pushed up the real by 4%
in just over a month (from September 1 through early October), and the past
years run-up has eroded the competitiveness of Brazilian exports.
To deter
the currencys rise, the government imposed a 4% tax on foreign purchases of
its bonds on October 4.
Its not only a currency war, Finance Minister
Guido Mantega explained. It tends to become a trade war and this is our
concern. [8]
Thailands central bank director Wongwatoo Potirat warned that his
country was considering similar taxes and currency trade restrictions to
stem the bahts rise.
Subir Gokarn, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of
India, announced that his country also was reviewing defenses against the
potential threat of inward capital flows. [9]
Such inflows do not provide capital for tangible investment.
They are
predatory, and cause currency fluctuation that disrupts trade patterns while
creating enormous trading profits for large financial institutions and their
customers.
Yet most discussions treat the balance of payments and exchange
rates as if they were determined purely by commodity trade and purchasing
power parity, not by the financial flows and military spending that
actually dominate the balance of payments.
The reality is that todays
financial interregnum - anarchic free markets prior to countries hurriedly
putting up their own monetary defenses - provides the arbitrage opportunity
of the century. This is what bank lobbyists have been pressing for. It has
little to do with the welfare of workers in their own country.
The potentially largest speculative prize promises to be an upward
revaluation of Chinas
renminbi.
The
House Ways and Means Committee is
demanding that China raise its exchange rate by the 20 percent that the
Treasury and
Federal Reserve are suggesting. Revaluation of this magnitude
would enable speculators to put down 1% equity - say, $1 million to borrow
$99 million - and buy Chinese renminbi forward.
The revaluation being
demanded would produce a 2000% profit of $20 million by turning the $100
million bet (and just $1 million serious money) into $120 million. Banks
can trade on much larger, nearly infinitely leveraged margins, much like
drawing up
CDO swaps and other derivative plays.
This kind of money has been made by speculating on Brazilian, Indian and
Chinese securities and those of other countries whose exchange rates have
been forced up by credit-flight out of the dollar, which has fallen by 7%
against a basket of currencies since early September when the Federal
Reserve floated the prospect of quantitative easing.
During the week leading
up to
the IMF meetings in Washington, the Thai baht and Indian rupee soared
in anticipation that the United States and Britain would block any attempts
by foreign countries to change the financial system and curb disruptive
currency gambling.
This capital outflow from the United States has indeed helped domestic banks
rebuild their balance sheets, as the Fed intended. But in the process the
international financial system has been victimized as collateral damage.
This prompted Chinese officials to counter U.S. attempts to blame it for
running a trade surplus by retorting that U.S. financial aggression,
risked
bringing mutual destruction upon the great economic powers. [10]
From the gold-exchange standard to the Treasury-bill standard to free
credit anarchy
Indeed, the standoff between the United States and other countries at the
IMF meetings in Washington this weekend threatens to cause the most serious
rupture since the breakdown of the London Monetary Conference in 1933.
The
global financial system threatens once again to break apart, deranging the
worlds trade and investment relationships - or to take a new form that will
leave the United States isolated in the face of its structural long-term
balance-of-payments deficit.
This crisis provides an opportunity - indeed, a need - to step back and
review the longue durée of international financial evolution to see where
past trends are leading and what paths need to be re-tracked. For many
centuries prior to 1971, nations settled their balance of payments in gold
or silver.
This money of the world, as Sir James Steuart called gold in
1767, formed the basis of domestic currency as well. Until 1971 each U.S.
Federal Reserve note was backed 25% by gold, valued at $35 an ounce.
Countries had to obtain gold by running trade and payments surpluses in
order to increase their money supply to facilitate general economic
expansion.
And when they ran trade deficits or undertook military campaigns,
central banks restricted the supply of domestic credit to raise interest
rates and attract foreign financial inflows.
As long as this behavioral condition remained in place, the international
financial system operated fairly smoothly under checks and balances, albeit
under stop-go policies when business expansions led to trade and payments
deficits. Countries running such deficits raised their interest rates to
attract foreign capital, while slashing government spending, raising taxes
on consumers and slowing the domestic economy so as to reduce the purchase
of imports.
What destabilized this system was war spending.
War-related transactions
spanning World Wars I and II enabled the United States to accumulate some
80% of the worlds monetary gold by 1950. This made the dollar a virtual
proxy for gold. But after the Korean War broke out, U.S. overseas military
spending accounted for the entire payments deficit during the 1950s and 60s
and early 70s, while private-sector trade and investment were exactly in
balance.
By August 1971, war spending in Vietnam and other foreign countries forced
the United States to suspend gold convertibility of the dollar through sales
via the
London Gold Pool. But largely by inertia, central banks continued to
settle their payments balances in U.S. Treasury securities. After all, there
was no other asset in sufficient supply to form the basis for central bank
monetary reserves.
But replacing gold - a pure asset - with
dollar-denominated U.S. Treasury debt transformed the global financial
system.
It became debt-based, not asset-based. And geopolitically, the
Treasury-bill standard made the United States immune from the traditional
balance-of-payments and financial constraints, enabling its capital markets
to become more highly debt-leveraged and innovative. It also enabled the
U.S. Government to wage foreign policy and military campaigns without much
regard for the balance of payments.
The problem is that the supply of dollar credit has become potentially
infinite. The dollar glut has grown in proportion to the U.S. payments
deficit. Growth in central bank reserves and sovereign-country funds has
taken the form of recycling of dollar inflows into new purchases of U.S.
Treasury securities - thereby making foreign central banks (and taxpayers)
responsible for financing most of the U.S. federal budget deficit.
The fact
that this deficit is largely military in nature - for purposes that many
foreign voters oppose - makes this lock-in particularly galling. So it
hardly is surprising that foreign countries are seeking an alternative.
Contrary to most public media posturing, the U.S. payments deficit - and
hence, other countries payments surpluses - is not primarily a trade
deficit. Foreign military spending has accelerated despite the Cold War
ending with dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Even more important has
been rising capital outflows from the United States.
Banks lent to foreign
governments from Third World countries to other deficit countries to cover
their national payments deficits, to private borrowers to buy the foreign
infrastructure being privatized or to buy foreign stocks and bonds, and to
arbitrageurs to borrow at a low interest rate to buy higher-yielding
securities abroad.
The corollary is that other countries balance-of-payments surpluses do not
stem primarily from trade relations, but from financial speculation and a
spillover of U.S. global military spending. Under these conditions the
maneuvering for quick returns by banks and their arbitrage customers is
distorting exchange rates for international trade.
U.S. quantitative
easing is coming to be perceived as a euphemism for a predatory financial
attack on the rest of the world.
Trade and currency stability are part of
the collateral damage caused by the Federal Reserve and Treasury flooding
the economy with liquidity to re-inflate U.S. asset prices. Faced with this
quantitative easing flooding the economy with reserves to save the banks
from negative equity, all countries are obliged to act as currency
manipulators.
So much money is made by purely financial speculation that
real economies are being destroyed.
The coming capital controls
The global financial system is being broken up as U.S. monetary officials
change the rules they laid down half a century ago.
Prior to the United
States going off gold in 1971, nobody dreamed that an economy could create
unlimited credit on computer keyboards and not see its currency plunge. But
that is what happens under the global Treasury-bill standard.
Foreign
countries can prevent their currencies from rising against the dollar (which
prices their labor and exports out of foreign markets) only,
-
by recycling
dollar inflows into U.S. Treasury securities
-
by imposing capital
controls
-
by avoiding use of the dollar or other currencies used by
financial speculators in economies promoting quantitative easing
Malaysia used capital controls during the 1997 Asian Crisis to prevent
short-sellers from covering their bets.
This confronted speculators with a
short squeeze that
George Soros says made him lose money on the attempted
raid.
Other countries are now reviewing how to impose capital controls to
protect themselves from the tsunami of credit flowing into their currencies
and buying up their assets - along with gold and other commodities that are
turning into vehicles for speculation rather than actual use in production.
Brazil took a modest step along this path by using tax policy rather than
outright capital controls when it taxed foreign buyers of its bonds last
week.
If other nations take this route, it will reverse the policy of open and
unprotected capital markets adopted after World War II.
This trend threatens
to lead to the kind of international monetary practice found from the 1930s
into the 50s: dual exchange rates, one for financial movements and another
for trade. It probably would mean replacing the IMF, World Bank and WTO with
a new set of institutions, isolating U.S., British and Eurozone
representation.
To defend itself, the IMF is proposing to act as a central bank creating
what was called paper gold in the late 1960s - artificial credit in the
form of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).
However, other countries already have
complained that voting control remains dominated by the major promoters of
arbitrage speculation - the United States, Britain and the Eurozone. And the
IMFs Articles of Agreement prevent countries from protecting themselves,
characterizing this as interfering with open capital markets. So the
impasse reached this weekend appears to be permanent.
As one report
summarized matters:
There is only one obstacle, which is the agreement of
the members, said a frustrated Mr Strauss Kahn. [11]
He added: The language is
ineffective. [12]
Paul Martin, the former Canadian prime minister who helped create the G20
after the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, noted that,
the big powers were
largely immune to being named and shamed.
And in a Financial Times
interview, Mohamed El-Erian, a former senior IMF official and now chief
executive of Pimco, said:
You have a burst pipe behind the wall and the
water is coming out. You have to fix the pipe, not just patch the wall.
[13]
The BRIC countries are simply creating their own parallel system.
In
September, China supported a Russian proposal to start direct trading
between the yuan and the ruble. It has brokered a similar deal with Brazil.
And on the eve of the IMF meetings in Washington on Friday, October 8,
Premier Wen stopped off in Istanbul to reach agreement with Turkish Prime
Minister Erdogan to use their own currencies in tripling Turkish-Chinese
trade to $50 billion over the next five years, effectively excluding the
U.S. dollar.
We are forming an economic strategic partnership
In all of
our relations, we have agreed to use the lira and yuan, Mr. Erdogan said.[14]
On the deepest economic plane todays global financial breakdown is part of
the price to be paid for the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury refusing to
accept a prime axiom of banking:
Debts that cannot be paid, wont be.
They
tried to save the banking system from debt write-downs in 2008 by keeping
the debt overhead in place while re-inflating asset prices.
In the face of
the repayment burden shrinking the U.S. economy, the Feds idea of helping
the banks earn their way out of negative equity is to provide
opportunities for predatory finance, leading to a flood of financial
speculation. Economies targeted by global speculators understandably are
seeking alternative arrangements.
It does not look like these can be
achieved via the IMF or other international forums in ways that U.S.
financial strategists will willingly accept.
