The year is 2010 and to anyone not in denial, the industrialized nations
have entered the greatest calamity the world has ever known:
-
35 Million Americans on Food Stamps: 12
Percent of U.S. Population on Food Stamps Highest Since Records Kept
in 1969, and thats before the Obama administration announced a
planned three-year budget freeze on government discretionary
spending.
(My Budget 360)
-
18 Million empty houses in the United
States and 39 million Americans who are no longer working or looking
for work, and thats before Federal Reserve finishes rewriting the
rules of American capitalism as US Housing, the Automobile
Industry and the American Dream are dismantled.
(The
31-Year-Old in Charge of Dismantling G.M., David E.
Sanger)
-
There are now well over 150 million
Americans who feel stress over these things on a consistent basis.
Over 60 percent of Americans now live paycheck to paycheck.
(The
Economic Elite vs. People of the USA, David DeGraw)
So then, why is President Obama going back on
his word and drilling holes in the earth?
The Interior Department under
Barack
Obama offered for sale more acres of dry-land drilling on
public lands than the Bush Administration had at the same point in 2008.
An economy in a state of rigor mortis doesnt need oil to lubricate an
engine that blew up on October 29, 2008, and our way of life wont come back
if the oil industry creates a handful of jobs or we reduce our dependence on
foreign oil.
Drill, Drill, Drill
didnt make environmental sense in 1973 or 2008
In 1973, Americas solution to the Arab oil embargo and long gas lines
wasnt mass transit, high mileage cars or alternative energy, it was the 800
mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline through some of the most pristine country in
Alaska.
Then in 2008, in response to $5.00/gallon gasoline, Americans agreed to give
up their last Arctic Wilderness and do more offshore drilling.
Despite the fact that the oil companies and the U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA), an independent statistical agency within the
Department of Energy, estimated that new oil from ANWR would have only a
negligible impact on the world price of oil.
The EIA projection for oil production in the
ANWR would amount to 0.4 to 1.2 percent of total world oil consumption in
2030, assuming the U.S. congress approved legislation to drill, back in
2008.
Drill, Drill, Drill
hasnt made economic sense for at least the last 20 years!
Matt Simmons an investment banker, considered to be a mover and shaker in
the oil industry thinks he,
spent his career in the wrong kind of
barrels.
From a presentation by Matt Simmons
2004 Offshore Technology Conference
[1]
It will take 16 trillion dollars to replace
the production we now have on line and add to it by 2030. Oil or another
form of energy is an indispensable requisite for life as we know it.
But over the past 20 years, oil has been a terrible investment. A 15%
return on investment (ROI) is what one expects to get from a building.
Oils ROI has largely been less than 15%. Scotch returns 50% ROI, wine
returns 15%.
Why has oil given such a lousy return? Because spot energy pricing,
where oil is bought and sold like a commodity has destroyed long term
value for the oil industry.
Spot markets make all contracts short term,
so no one is looking out for the future.
The not-so-invisible hand of JP Morgan
Chase is guilty of the ongoing intentional, not accidental, great
crime of manipulating the spot markets, lower, not higher as you
would expect. So you could, prior to 2008, save money and live
better while at the same time pollute the environment.
(Silver,
But No Silver Lining)
[End of the Matt Simmons Presentation]
Why has oil been a terrible investment?
Inexplicably, the industry picks the most expensive places on the earth to
drill for oil.
Chevron spent $2.7 billion over 10 years on
just the first phase of a deep-water oil project in the Gulf. Other
sub-salt discoveries involve drilling more than 30,000 feet, some of the
most expensive wells ever drilled.
On January 7, 2010, the Wall Street Journal
published,
Cramped on Land, Big Oil Bets at Sea
Big Oil never wanted to be here, in 4,300
feet of water far out in the Gulf of Mexico, drilling through nearly
five miles of rock. It is an expensive way to look for oil.
You really dont need to know a lot about geology or oil to figure out
something is wrong here, why dont they go back to the old days and
drill oil wells onshore?
(Buy
Oil Stocks
No Matter What, Chris Mayer)
Drill, Drill, Drill,
Environmental damage is the answer
The Environmental damage and pollution to the earth from the role petroleum
products play in modern society; the intentional and accidental releases
into the environment, was the Goal, Not The Unintended Consequence of the
Petroleum Industry.
The Powers That Be (TPTB),
are in a metaphysical struggle with Mother-Earth (Gaea)
and created the middle class afflicted with The Narcissism Epidemic: Living
in the Age of Entitlement (The American Dream) for the last 75
years, in order to weaken the planet with environmental damage and
pollution. (The Question of Questions)
Until October 2008, the huddled middle class masses should have been
thanking
John D. Rockefeller and the Petroleum
industry for letting former serfs and slaves drive cars, trucks, motorcycles
and RVs to the mall so they could consume useless toxic products from the
petroleum industry. (Liberté,
Egalité, Fraternité - Providence, Miracle or What Really Happened)
But at the same time they should have been blaming them for, putting the
planet, according to a massive United Nations report the GEO4, at the
unknown points of no return
TPTB believed if they gave up their real wealth: Raw materials, commodities,
copper, iron ore, petroleum, lead, copper, silver and gold in exchange for
$500 trillion of the fiat currency (Monopoly money) they created out of thin
air so the middle class could live the American Dream, a nightmare for Gaea,
they would attain immortality in a period known as the New World Order
(Millennium).
The New Heavens and the New Earth is the eternal destination and a
thousand years of peace and plenty and paradise on Earth for
The House of Rothschild,
Global elite,
Illuminati,
Bilderbergers,
CFR
and the other secret societies (righteous people).
On October 29, 2008, TPTB determined their plan did not succeed: They were
unable to defeat Gaea.
Gehenna and the abyss is the eternal destination and a thousand years of
punishment for The House of Rothschild, Global elite, Illuminati,
Bilderbergers, CFR and the other secret societies (wicked people).
TPTB did not wish to spend eternity in Hell, so between October of 2008 and
October 2009, they threatened Gaea with World War III. "Escalation
Scenarios: The Third World War and Its Aftermath" and
Dr.
Strangelove articles were everywhere in the media.
The Book of Revelation describes the final battle with Gaea and there is no
Nuclear World War III at Armageddon in the valley of Megiddo. Therefore, the
escalation scenarios were a bluff (we hope). Rev 9:16 describes a
hand-to-hand combat when the world ends. A Nuclear Armageddon would make too
much of the planet uninhabitable for the One World governors and the 500
million useful eaters they need for slaves when they take over the world.
Google Trends confirmed the TPTB thought the bluff was successful when the
Nuclear War headlines were replaced with
the Swine Flu.
President Barack Obama declared the swine
flu outbreak a national emergency.
Washington Post (October 25, 2009)
The nations chief health officer had the power
to let hospitals move emergency rooms offsite to speed up the immunization
of the masses with a shot-based on genome sequencing - a
biotechnology that allows a doctor to tailor medical treatments to an
individuals genetic profile:
Here for your shot?
Worried about the Bird Flu? Oh of course
sit here, roll up your sleeve. Oops, sorry you died.
Well I guess it was too late for you; next
time, get here sooner!
The controversial Swine Flu
vaccine, many believe, was a ruse to start us on a slow and
orderly road to a population of slaves (useful eaters). (Ominous
Signs Are Aligned - Not A Particularly Good Sign)
Bluff Unsuccessful,
Perpetual Check
As of November 10, 2010 swine flu articles were replaced with headlines
about drilling holes in the earth indicating the bluff - the threat of a
nuclear war failed.
In a futile attempt to avoid going to Hell, TPTB are drilling holes in the
earth hoping to find a heretofore undiscovered vulnerability in the
earths crust:
Interior secretary Salazar announced 38
lease sales for oil and gas on public lands and 75 days later President
Obama signed an executive order to loan two billion dollars of our tax
payers dollars to a Brazilian Oil Exploration Company to drill for oil
off the coast of Brazil.
This is a strategy known in Chess as perpetual
check - a sequence of checks from which the opponent (Gaea) can escape,
used by a player (TPTB) with a worse position in order not to lose the game.
The Fateful Geological
Prize Called Haiti - Check!
F. William Engdahl, authority on the
New
World Order and most of the scholars, pundits and thinkers of our
time have a strongly held belief that everything wrong in the world is
because someone is, greedy, corrupt or just power hungry.
F.W. and the experts believe we sent 20,000 US troops to Haiti on the
pretext of humanitarian aid so,
Washington and private business interests
tied to it could get a geopolitical prize of the first order.
F.W. writes prolifically about the New World
Order at the Center for Global Research and would probably admit the
Federal Reserve fiscal policy is as much about power as about
money but without a metaphysical perspective, he would not agree the
environmental damage and pollution was the goal of our consumer society.
The
Fateful Geological Prize Called Haiti is his latest article that
erroneously asserts that the real reason for the US military occupation of
Haiti is so we can carve up of the vast wealth of the nation.
Haitian scholar Dr.
Georges Michel, wrote that the U.S.
has known about the vast oil and natural gas reserves in Haiti since 1908.
So why are we carving up Haiti now?
A clue to this enigma can be found in The Fateful Geological Prize Called
Haiti:
The vast oil reserves of the Persian Gulf
and of the region from the Red Sea into the Gulf of Aden are at a
similar convergence zone of large tectonic plates, as are such oil-rich
zones as Indonesia and the waters off the coast of California.
In short, in terms of the physics of the
earth, precisely such intersections of tectonic masses as run directly
beneath Haiti have a remarkable tendency to be the sites of vast
treasures of minerals, as well as oil and gas, throughout the world.
(2005, Caribbean Basins, Tectonics and
Hydrocarbons Institute for Geophysics at the University of Texas)
F.W. misses the significance of determining as
precisely as possible the relation between tectonic plates but the
geologists do not:
The Jan. 12 earthquake was on a fault line
that passes near potential gas reserves, said Stephen Pierce, a
geologist who worked in the region for 30 years. The quake may have
cracked rock formations along the fault, allowing gas or oil to
temporarily seep toward the surface, he said yesterday in a telephone
interview.
A geologist, callous as it may seem, tracing
that fault zone from Port-au-Prince to the border looking for gas and
oil seeps, may find a structure that hasnt been drilled, said Pierce,
exploration manager at Zion Oil & Gas Inc.
The earthquake in Haiti may have exposed
vulnerability (a structure that hasnt been drilled) in the earths crust
and TPTB are rushing to take military advantage of their opponent. [2]
Crusextraction of the
Earth, Response - Earthquakes And Tsunamis
In 2005, world oil-production alone (not including natural-gas) was an
incomprehensible 80-100 million barrels of oil per day.
USGS coastal geologists understand these factors cannot be ignored as far as
influencing earth crust stresses and confirm the earths response to
extracting by force 3,360,000,000 - 4,200,000,000 gallons of the planets
vital fluids every single day:
Earthquakes and tsunamis.
While disagreement abounds on this topic, scientists at the U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS) say that oil production at plate boundaries where hard, rocky
slabs slide against each other to releases tremendous amounts of energy and
could be the cause for the 2004 quake that triggered a deadly tsunami in
Sumatra.
Here's how it works: With high-tech
equipment, oil companies pinpoint oil-rich areas and use large drills to
puncture the surface below the sea, sometimes as deep as 10,000 feet. As
this pricey fluid gets sucked from the sediment pores, the surrounding
rocks shift positions to fill in the newly vacated spaces.
At a large scale, for example the volume
displaced when millions of barrels of oil are produced, the land
movement can actually cause a mini-seismic earthquake, said Robert
Morton, a USGS coastal geologist. During these various stages the globe
of the earth is gradually being depressurized and cooled internally,
causing contraction for both of these reasons.
When objects cool down, they automatically
shrink/contract in size. If you let high-pressure air or gas out of a
cylinder, it forms ice around the outlet, and cools the entire cylinder.
If you let some of the air out of a football, or basketball, the ball
shrinks and goes badly out of shape.
Apply that to the Earth and you have earthquakes - simple common-sense
- not rocket-science. A fact so simple that anyone who understands the
oil-extraction process would understand, but, because they are
insanely-blinded by their insatiable greed and avarice, they often
overlook the obvious.
(Paul Noel, JAH, Sterling D. Allan and
Mary-Sue Halliburton) [3]
The Crusextraction
During the various stages of the energy extraction process, the globe of the
earth suffers limitless pain as the area where the drilling occurs.
It is gradually being depressurized and cooled
internally, causing cycles of constriction, joint-rending cramps,
intermittent partial asphyxiation and searing pain as they use large drills
to puncture pericardium and into the heart, sometimes as deep as 10,000
feet.
As the serum gets sucked from the sediment pores, the surrounding rocks
shift positions to fill the newly vacated spaces causing unbearable agony as
the earth automatically contracts in size and goes badly out of shape
resulting in a deep crushing pain.
"I Thirst."
"My strength is dried up like a potsherd; my
tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of
death."
(Psalm 22:15)
Then another agony begins when millions of
barrels of vital bodily fluids are produced.
This causes deep, crushing pain as the sac
surrounding the bowels of the earth slowly fill with hydrocarbon soil and
began to compress the tectonic plates causing (shock) mini-seismic
earthquakes.
"I am poured out like water, and all my
bones are out of joint, my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst
of my bowels."
Psalm 22:14
When the loss of fluids reaches a critical
level, the earth is struggling to pump heavy, thick, sluggish serum that is
not only pressurized, but is also hot. As it is extracted, the tortured
lungs of the earth are suffocating and are making a frantic effort to inhale
small gulps of air.
The pressure gradually decreases, making it less profitable to take the
remaining serum, but to make doubly sure of a mortal wound, the legionnaire
uses external-energy to pierce and inject cold water into the sac
surrounding the heart.
"They shall look on Him whom they pierced."
Psalm 22:16,17
"And immediately there came out blood and
water."
John 19:34
As the sac fills with cold water, the last
remaining serum floats up on top. This escape of watery fluid from the sac
surrounding the heart and the wound through the sac surrounding the interior
of the heart causes painful Tsunamis.
This is rather conclusive evidence that the
earth was tormented but not deceased.
Conclusion
There are only three outcomes to this galactic metaphysical struggle that
goes back, at least, to the Dark Ages: (The Question of Questions)
-
Gaea determines mans future.
-
TPTB determine mans future in a new
World Order where they attain immortality and rid the planet of all
but 500 million useful eaters.
-
TPTP are defeated (As I claim they were
October 2008) and have three choices:
-
The dragon, that ancient serpent,
who is the devil, or Satan (TPTB) can accept defeat and agree to
be tossed into the Abyss, be locked up for a 1000 years and then
thrown into the Lake of Fire.
-
Make good on a threat of total world
annihilation (i.e. Nagasaki and Hiroshima) and spend a 1000
years in the 700-acre, secret subterranean city, deep within the
bedrock underneath Central Park in Manhattan (Manhattan
Project). This assumes Gaea allows them to launch WWIII.
[4]
-
Continue to drill holes in the earth
(Perpetual Check) prolonging the inevitable looking for a
heretofore-undiscovered vulnerability in the Earths crust.
I know not what course others may take, but as
for me I hope the TPTB accept defeat and are thrown into the Lake of Fire.

[2] Coso Springs - Check
Drilling holes in the earths crust for oil isnt the only strategy for
weakening the earth.
The U.S. Department of Energy has reported that just one geothermal
location out of the hundreds that have been identified, is so powerful
it has the potential to produce 50,000 times the known oil and gas
reserves in the world.
The Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake, sits on top of the
Coso Hot Springs, one of the hottest
land masses in the United States and could be vulnerability in the
Earth.
To bring heat up to the surface they drill a hole deep into the Earth,
tapping the area beneath the Earth's surface that produces heat over 400
degrees. Next, they inject water into the hole. The water instantly
boils and begins to produce steam that rises out of the hole.
[3] However, since A.D. 1900 [the dawn of the Industrial Age and our
Consumer society], the growth in major earthquakes has been relentless.
From 1900 to 1949 it averaged three major quakes per decade. From
1949 the increase became awesome with 9 killer quakes in the 1950's; 13
in the 60's; 56 in the 1970's and an amazing 74 major quakes in the
1980's. Finally, in the 1990's, as [sic] the present rate, we will
experience 125 major killer quakes in this decade (Source: U.S.
Geological Survey Earthquake Report, Boulder, Colorado).
[4] Is there anything we can do to prevent total world annihilation?
This question was posed to
Duncan O'Finioan at the September 2009,
Awake and Aware Conference in Los Angeles put on Bill Ryan and
Kerry Cassidy founders of
Project Camelot.
Project Camelot Overview and mission statement:
To provide researchers, activists and
whistleblowers with access to all forms of media in order to get
the truth out.
Our focus includes but is not limited to
the following:
extraterrestrial visitation and
contact, time travel, mind control, classified advanced
technology, free energy, possible coming earth changes,
revealing plans that exist to control the human race.
Project Camelot is clearly a
disinformation project, however there is information in
disinformation.
Duncan O'Finioan was a featured speaker at the September conference.
Duncan, allegedly, is a refugee from a US military program that trained
super soldiers, with psychic abilities and uncommon strength - and
skilled in psychotronics, that is:
mind control.
[Excerpt from We
Are No Mind Control Experiment] Kerry Cassidy
After Duncan tells you to avoid anything with the word Project on the
front, (4:57,
http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/2197572)
he responds to a question from an attendee in the audience about the
Illuminati.
Duncan: Find a teacher someone who is a
true white lighter, work with them let em teach you.
Attendee: And the possible solution if we can send white light,
energy and love, call it prayer, call it what you will. To
you know,
its a radical idea, but to the Illuminati or the leaders out there,
so that they can help to understand really what they are doing. And
so they will have more love and actually change their mind to
prevent unleashing such a super soldier force. As well as helping to
shield them in the same energies that are shielding you so that the
negative energies that are around them will not be able to be around
them.
Duncan: You raise an excellent point, however the Illuminati know
exactly what they are doing. What you are saying has merit and
possibly has a chance
Then Kerry Cassidy takes over the stage and
delivers the following speech:
Kerry: OK I want, I want to say
something here, what we are talking about is awareness. OK, being
awake and being aware knowing OK, becoming aware just the act of
learning and becoming aware just what we are doing right here, this
creates the power. OK, its not enough to just send blind light blind
love. OK, it must be intelligent it must have perception attached
you must do more than just give the heart. OK, you must understand
what you are seeing and why you are doing what you are doing thats
so knowing, and putting that piece together that thats the missing
piece. OK, and then, its awareness. OK, what you want to convey is
the awareness of all the aspects of whats going on there. OK, so if
you are loving, you are loving consciously knowing all the
parameters of what that means, not blindly OK, so dont give your
energy blindly. If you know if you want to give your energy
and
power and light and love to the Illuminati, know what you are doing,
be conscious while you are doing it.
[Review the upstream video below and confirm Kerrys use of the
word OK is a mind control trigger.
Bill & Kerry - General Discussion]
Kerry: If you want to give your energy
and power and light and
love to the Illuminati, to stop the Illuminati from unleashing
total world annihilation, know what you are doing, be conscious
while you are doing it.
