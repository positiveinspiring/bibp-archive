Awareness is growing around the world that the Wikileaks-Julian Assange
theater of the absurd is radically inauthentic - a psyop.
Wikileaks and its impaired boss represent a
classic form of limited hangout or self-exposure, a kind of lurid striptease
in which the front organization releases doctored and pre-selected materials
provided by the intelligence agency with the intent of harming, not the CIA,
nor the UK, nor the Israelis, but rather such classic CIA enemies list
figures as,
Putin, Berlusconi, Karzai, Qaddafi,
Rodriguez de Kirchner, etc.
In Tunisia, derogatory material about
ex-President Ben Ali leaked by Wikileaks has already brought a
windfall for Langley in the form of the rare ouster of an entrenched Arab
government.

At Foggy Bottom and Langley, a manic fit has
been building since the flight of Ben Ali.
U.S. imperialist planners now
believe they can re-launch their shopworn model of the color revolution, CIA
people-power coup, or postmodern putsch against a whole series of countries
in the Arab world and far beyond, including Italy.
The color revolutions had been looking tarnished
lately, as a result of the failure of the Twitter Revolution in Iran back in
June 2009.
Previously, the Cedars Revolution of 2005 had
failed in Lebanon. The Orange Revolution in Ukraine had been rolled back
with the ouster of NATO-IMF kleptocrats Yushchenko and Timoshenko.
In
Georgia, the Roses Revolution was increasingly discredited by the repressive
and warmongering regime of fascist madman Saakashvili.
U.S. Seeks to Mobilize
...a New Generation of Young Nihilists Across the Globe
But now, NSC, State, and CIA believe that the color revolution has a new
lease on life, thanks to their estimate that the United States, because of
Wikileaks and Assange, has captured the imagination of a new generation of
young nihilists across the globe who are described as the post-9/11
generation, estranged from governments and opposition parties, and thus
ready to follow Langleys peroxide
Pied Piper.
Assange started his intensive deployment phase this year with video of a
Class A U.S. war crime in Iraq, which was very graphic but which dealt with an
incident which was already widely known.
The second document dump focused on Iraq, but
now the targeting had shifted to Prime Minister Maliki, and the Iranian
asset whom the U.S. by some strange coincidence was trying to oust as leader
of Iraq in favor of the U.S. puppet Allawi.
With the third document dump, this time
involving State Department cables, we found out much derogatory gossip about
such classic CIA targets as,
-
Russian prime minister Putin
-
Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi
-
the Russian-Italian strategic alliance
-
President Fernandez de Kirchner of
Argentina
-
President Karzai of Afghanistan,
...along with jabs at supposed U.S. allies who
need to be kept off-balance and dependent, including the Saudi Arabian royal
family, French President Sarkozy, and others.
Wikileaks thus directs the vast majority of its
fire against figures who are part of the CIAs enemies list.
No Equal Time for CIA
Covert Operations
Assange also provides a splendid pretext for draconian censorship and
limitations on the freedom of the internet.
The totalitarian liberal Senator Feinstein wants
to bring back Woodrow Wilsons infamous Espionage Act of 1917 in honor of
Assange. Assange must be seen not as an activist, not as a journalist, and
not as an entertainer, but rather as a spook.
John Young of Cryptome, according to some
reports, has denounced Wikileaks, to which he formerly belonged, as a CIA
front.
In a December 29 RT interview,
Young described the internet as,
a very large-scale spying machine. 1
The internet is indeed a vast battlefield, where
the intelligence agencies of the U.S.-UK, China, Israel, Russia, and many
others clash every hour of the day, with commercial spies, hackers,
anarchists, cultists, mercenary trolls, and psychotics all getting into the
act as well.
Intelligence agencies deliberately feed real and
doctored material to various websites, sometimes using their own disgruntled
employees as cutouts, conduits, and go-betweens. This means among other
things that Bradley Manning cannot be taken at face value, although it is
also clear that he like anyone else should not be tortured.
Assange is now famous, it might be argued. But the Wall Street
controlled
media can make anyone famous, from Lady Gaga to Justin Bieber to Snooki, and
this is what they have done with Assange. It is wrong to capitulate to the
demagogic power of these media by making it appear that there might be some
legitimate value to Assange.
Up to now,
the CIA has been organizing color
revolutions using Twitter,
Facebook, Youtube, and so forth as vehicles.
Now they think they have a cult figure whom they
can sell to the youth bulge in the Arab world and other developing
countries, where most of the population is under 30. This is an operation
which must be exposed.
Most recently, Wikileaks has played a role in the CIAs new Jasmine
Revolution in Tunisia by publishing some State Department cables about the
sybaritic luxury and lavish lifestyle of the Ben Ali clan, leading to the
downfall of that regime. The CIA is now gloating that with the help of
Wikileaks it can now topple all the Arab regimes at will, from Mubarak to
Qaddafi to Bouteflika, and replace them with new and more pliable puppets
eager to clash with Iran, Russia, and China
If Assange ever launches his much-touted doomsday machine against the Bank
of America or some other financial institutions, we will be justified in
asking that the Securities and Exchange Commission make public the extent of
short interest in those stocks by certain hedge funds, especially those
controlled by
George Soros.
And as far as Assanges attacks on
the
Vatican are concerned, they fit neatly into four centuries of
British intelligence warfare against the Holy See, going back to Guy
Fawkes and Lord Robert Cecils
Gunpowder Plot of 1605 and beyond.
Not much new or radical here...
Wikileaks - No Serious
Derogatory Information about U.S., UK, Israel
It is illuminating that none of Assanges document dumps have revealed any
notable scandals involving Great Britain or Israel.
No U.S. public figures have had to resign because
of anything Wikileaks has done. No major ongoing covert operation or highly
placed agent of influence has been blown. After all these months, there are
still no U.S. indictments against Assange, even though we know that a U.S. grand
jury will readily indict a ham sandwich if the U.S. Attorney demands it.
If the CIA had wanted to silence Assange, they
could have subjected him to the classic kidnapping aka rendition, meaning
that he would have been beaten, drugged, and carted off to wake up in a
black site prison in Egypt, Poland, or Guantanamo Bay.
Otherwise, the CIA could have had recourse to
the usual extralegal wetwork.
We must also assume that the new
U.S. Cybercommand with its vast resources would have little trouble shutting down
the Wikileaks mirror sites, no matter how numerous they might be. The same
goes for Anonymous and other flanking organizations of Wikileaks. But these
considerations are purely fantastic.
Assange emerges today as the pampered darling
and golden boy of The New York Times, Der Spiegel, The Guardian, El Pais -
in short, of the entire Anglo-American
official media Wurlitzer.
He reclines today in baronial splendor in the
country house of a well-connected retired British officer who should be
quizzed by the media about his ties to British intelligence.
The radical-chic world, from Bianca Jagger to
Michael Moore, is at Assanges feet.
Cass Sunstein Present
at the Creation of Wikileaks
Wikileaks was apparently founded in 2006.
Originally, the group was programmed to attack
China, and its board was heavily larded with fishy Chinese dissidents and
democracy activists from the orbit of the Soros foundations.
Interestingly, the first big publicity
breakthrough for Wikileaks in the mainstream U.S. media was provided by an
infamous totalitarian liberal today ensconced in the Obama White House -
none other than
Cass Sunstein.
In Sunsteins op-ed published in the Washington
Post of February 24, 2007 under the title Brave new Wikiworld, we read:
Wikileaks.org, founded by dissidents in
China and other nations, plans to post secret government documents and
to protect them from censorship with coded software.
How interesting that Sunstein was present at the
creation of the new Wikileaks psywar operation!
This is the same Sunstein who today heads Obamas White House
Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs.
In his January 2008 Harvard Law School Working
Paper entitled Conspiracy Theories, Sunstein infamously demanded that the
United States government deploy groups of covert operatives and
pseudo-independent agents of influence for the cognitively infiltration of
extremist groups - meaning organizations, activists and Internet websites
who espouse beliefs which Sunstein chooses to classify as false conspiracy
theories.
Wikileaks = Cass
Sunsteins Program for Cognitive Infiltration In Action
It should be clear that Assange and Wikileaks are precisely the practical
realization of Sunsteins program for cognitive infiltration shock troops
to counteract and overwhelm any real mass understanding of oligarchical
domination in the modern world, and any discussion of what kind of economic
policies are needed to secure a recovery from the present world depression.
In line with Sunsteins recipe, Assange is a self-declared enemy of 9/11
truth.
As Assange
told Belfast Telegraph reporter Matthew Bell last July,
Im constantly annoyed that people are
distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11, when all around we
provide evidence of real conspiracies, for war or mass financial fraud.
In other words, Assange argues that
the truth
about 9/11 truth is not nearly as radical as the various scandals which Wikileaks claims to expose.
But the scandals Assange is offering target
mostly the adversaries of the CIA.
Assange must also be seen as a deeply troubled individual and a possible
psychopath. He has the ravaged emotional complexion that we might expect
from an alumnus of one of the many MK-Ultra operations.
He reportedly spent several years in the
menticidal
Anne Hamilton-Byrne cult (also known as The
Family and Santiniketan) near Melbourne, Australia.
Here little children were separated from their
parents and made to ingest,
LSD,
Anatensol,
Diazepam,
Haloperidol,
Largactil,
Mogadon,
Serepax,
Stelazine,
Tegretol,
Tofranil, and other
potent psychopharmaca.
Dozens of children were told that Hamilton-Byrne
was their real mother, and had their hair dyed blond.
Anne Hamilton-Byrne reportedly regarded
blond hair as a sign of racial superiority. Careful observers will have
noted that Assanges hair is sometimes blond, sometimes more brownish,
raising the question of whether his grooming practices are a residue of his
time with Hamilton-Byrne, whom he says he does not remember.
When other kids were getting cookies and milk,
was Assange being lobotomized by LSD and other potent psychopharmaca dished
up by Hamilton-Byrne?
There is evidence pointing in that direction.
With Assange, we thus have the tragic spectacle of the emotionally mutilated
product of a CIA (or MI-6) covert operation of 40 years ago, who has now
been given a prominent role in a key counter-insurgency ploy of the present
time.
Will the youth of the world, already burned by
their recent fatuous obsession with
Obama, be duped again by such an
impaired individual?
The Precedent
Pentagon Papers Whitewashed CIA, Blamed Army, Demonized
Kennedy
Assanges revelations mainly involve communications labeled Confidential or
Secret, and which in reality would be over-classified if marked Official Use
Only. In other words, Assange is in reality a purveyor of low level cable
traffic, not of earth-shattering secrets.
This reminds us of an earlier CIA limited
hangout operation, the one known as
the Pentagon Papers.
This was a carefully screened selection of
historical documents, supplemented by outright forgeries, relating to the
Vietnam War and compiled by Morton Halperin and Leslie Gelb,
both of whom have gone on to glittering careers in the imperialist foreign
policy establishment - Gelb became president of the
Council on Foreign
Relations, while Halperin serves today as chief political officer of the
Soros wolfpack of foundations.
The papers were leaked by former RAND
Corporation official Daniel Ellsberg, who had been a very bellicose hawk in
Vietnam before a suspicious Damascus Road conversion to pacifism, and then
published in the U.S. establishment press - similarly to Assange today. There
was nothing in the Pentagon papers which a casual reader of LeMonde or
Corriere della Sera did not already know.
But, as Mort Sahl later said, left
liberals have generally had very few heroes, so they battened on to Ellsberg
and lionized him - led by
Noam Chomsky,
Howard Zinn, and some others.
(This is a syndrome which we see again today: at
the moment when Obamas treacherous sellout on the Bush tax cuts was
providing a final disillusionment for many gullible left libs, Assange
arrived on the scene as their new Savior. Not by chance, Ellsberg has now
designated Assange as his own reincarnation, and thus surely the new
Messiah.)
The Pentagon papers had been carefully selected by the CIA itself to cover
up CIA war crimes in Vietnam, blaming these on the U.S. Army wherever
possible, while also obscuring the CIAs massive program of drug production
and narcotics smuggling.
The Pentagon Papers systematically hid the
salient political fact of the entire Vietnam era, which is that President
John F. Kennedy before he was assassinated was preparing to end the de facto
U.S. combat role in that country. Instead, Kennedy was systematically
demonized and smeared, emerging as the villain of the piece.
Needless to say, the Pentagon papers throw no
light whatsoever on the CIA role in the Kennedy assassination - in the
same way that Assanges various document dumps tell us nothing of
importance about 9/11, the Rabin assassination, Iran-contra, the 1999
bombing of Serbia, the Kursk incident, the various CIA color revolutions,
or many of the other truly big covert operations of the past decades.
The limited hangout is not new; it was described in a secret memorandum by
Venetian intelligence chief Paolo Sarpi to the Venetian Senate in
1620 as the art of,
saying something good about somebody while
pretending to be saying something bad.
That is the common denominator of the CIAs
limited hangout operations from Ellsberg to Philip Agee to Assange, with so
many other former CIA operatives turned whistleblowers along the way.
