U.S. embassy cables
released by WikiLeaks on Wednesday and Thursday expose the
close collaboration between the U.S. government, top American politicians and Muammar Gaddafi, who Washington now insists must be hunted down and
murdered.
Washington and its NATO allies are now determined to smash the Libyan
regime, supposedly in the interests of liberating the Libyan people. That
Gaddafi was until the beginning of this year viewed as a strategic, if
somewhat unreliable, ally is clearly seen as an inconvenient truth.
The cables have been virtually blacked out by the corporate media, which has
functioned as an embedded asset of NATO and the so-called rebel forces that
it directs.
It is hardly coincidental that the WikiLeaks posting of the
cables was followed the next day by a combination of a massive denial of
service attack and a U.S. judges use of the Patriot Act to issue a sweeping
production order or subpoena against the anti-secrecy organizations
California-based Domain Name Server,
Dynadot.
The most damning of these cables memorializes an August 2009 meeting (below
insert) between Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his son and
national security adviser, Muatassim, with,
McCain, the Republican presidential
candidate in 2008, has in recent speeches denounced Gaddafi as,
one of the most bloodthirsty dictators on
Earth and criticized the Obama administration for failing to employ
the full weight of our airpower in effecting regime change in Libya.
In the meeting held just two years ago, however,
McCain took the lead in currying favor with the Gaddafis.
According to the embassy cable, he assured
them that,
the United States wanted to provide Libya
with the equipment it needs for its security and pledged to see what
he could do to move things forward in Congress.
The cable continues to relate McCains remarks:
He encouraged Muatassim to keep in mind the
long-term perspective of bilateral security engagement and to remember
that small obstacles will emerge from time to time that can be overcome.
He described the bilateral military relationship as strong and pointed
to Libyan officer training at U.S. Command, Staff, and War colleges as
some of the best programs for Libyan military participation.
The cable quote Lieberman as saying,
We never would have guessed ten years ago
that we would be sitting in Tripoli, being welcomed by a son of Muammar
al-Qadhafi. It states that the Connecticut senator went on to describe
Libya as an important ally in the war on terrorism, noting that common
enemies sometimes make better friends.
The common enemies referred to by Lieberman
were precisely the Islamist forces concentrated in eastern Libya that the
U.S.
then backed Gaddafi in repressing, but has now organized, armed and led in
the operation to overthrow him.
The U.S. embassy summarized:
McCains meetings with Muammar and
Muatassim al-Qadhafi were positive, highlighting the progress that has
been made in the bilateral relationship.
The meetings also reiterated Libyas desire
for enhanced security cooperation, increased assistance in the
procurement of defense equipment, and resolution to the C130s issue (a
contract that went unfulfilled because of previous sanctions).
Another cable issued on the same meeting deals
with McCains advice to the Gaddafis about the upcoming release from a
Scottish prison of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who had been convicted for the
1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
McCain, who now fulminates about Gaddafi having,
American blood on his hands, counseled the
Libyan leader that the release was a very sensitive issue in the U.S.
and that he should handle it discreetly, in a way that would strengthen
the growing relationship between our two countries, rather than hinder
its progress.
Ultimately Gaddafi and other leading Libyan
officials gave a heros welcome to Megrahi, who has proclaimed his innocence
and had been set to have his appeal heard when the Scottish government
released him.
Other cables highlight the increasingly close U.S.-Libyan military and
security cooperation. One, sent in February 2009, provides a security
environment profile for Libya.
It notes that U.S. personnel were,
scheduled to provide 5 training courses to
host government law enforcement and security the next month.
In answer to whether the Libyan government had
been able to,
score any major anti-terrorism successes,
the embassy praised the Gaddafi regime for having dismantled a network
in eastern Libya that was sending volunteer fighters to Algeria and Iraq
and was plotting attacks against Libyan security targets using
stockpiled explosives. The operation resulted in the arrest of over 100
individuals.
Elements of this same network make up an
important component of the rebels now armed and led by NATO.
Asked by the State Department if there existed any indigenous anti-American
terrorist groups in the country, the embassy replied yes, pointing to the
Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), which it noted had recently
announced its merger with Al Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb
(AQIM).
Again, elements of the LIFG are active in the
leadership of the so-called rebels.
An April 2009 cable preparing Muatassim Gaddafis trip to Washington that
month stresses plans for anti-terrorist training for Libyan military
officers and potential arms deals.
In its conclusion the embassy states:
The visit offers an opportunity to meet a
power player and potential future leader of Libya. We should also view
the visit as an opportunity to draw out Muatassim on how the Libyans
view normalized relations with the U.S. and, in turn, to convey how we
view the future of the relationship as well.
Given his role overseeing Libyas national
security apparatus, we also want his support on key security and
military engagement that serves our interests.
A May 2009 cable details a cordial hour-long
meeting between Gaddafi and the then-head of the U.S. Africa Command, General
William Ward.
An August 2008 cable, a scene setter for the historic visit of Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice to Tripoli, declares that,
Libya has been a strong partner in the war
against terrorism and cooperation in liaison channels is excellent
Counter-terrorism cooperation is a key pillar of the U.S.-Libya
bilateral relationship and a shared strategic interest.
Many of the cables deal with opportunities for
U.S. energy and construction firms to reap bonanzas in the North African
country and note with approval privatization efforts and the setting up of a
Tripoli stock exchange.
Others, however, express concern, not about the Gaddafi regimes repressive
measures, but rather foreign policy and oil policy moves that could
prejudice U.S. interests. Thus, an October 2008 cable, cynically headlined
AL-QADHAFI: TO RUSSIA, WITH LOVE? expresses U.S. concern about the Gaddafi
regimes approach to Russia for lucrative arms purchases and a visit to
Tripoli harbor by a flotilla of Russian warships.
One month later, during a visit to Moscow,
Gaddafi discussed with the Putin regime the prospect of the Russian navy
establishing a Mediterranean port in the city of Benghazi, setting off alarm
bells at the Pentagon.
Cables from 2008 and 2009 raise concerns about U.S. corporations not getting
in on billions of dollars in opportunities for infrastructure contracts
and fears that the Gaddafi regime could make good on the Libyan leaders
threat to nationalize the oil sector or utilize the threat to extract more
favorable contracts from the foreign energy corporations.
The cables underscore the hypocrisy of the U.S. and its allies in Britain,
France and Italy, who have championed regime change in the name of
protecting Libyan civilians and promoting democracy.
Those like Obama, Sarkozy, Cameron and Berlusconi
who have branded Gaddafi a criminal to be hunted down and murdered were all
his accomplices. All of them collaborated with, armed and supported the
Gaddafi regime, as U.S. and European corporations reaped vast profits from
Libyas oil wealth.
In the end, they seized upon the upheavals in the region and the
anti-Gaddafi protests in Libya as the opportunity to launch a war to
establish outright semi-colonial control over the energy-rich country
and,
Rid themselves of an ally who was never seen
as fully reliable or predictable and upset his patrons with demands for,
-
better deals with big oil
-
closer ties with Russia and China
-
the threat of replacing the Euro and
Dollar with a Gold Dinar
