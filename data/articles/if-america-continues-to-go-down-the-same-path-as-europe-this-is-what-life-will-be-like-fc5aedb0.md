Life Will Be Like

Becoming more like Europe is not
a good thing. But that is the path that we are currently on.
For the most part, Europeans live in a socialist
"Big
Brother" system in which the government completely dominates your
life from the cradle to the grave. Of course there are differences from
country to country, but generally speaking the lives of most Europeans are
very tightly regulated.
You see, the truth is that high levels of
individual liberty and freedom are considered to be "dangerous" by the
European elite. They believe that if we are all allowed to just do whatever
we want that it would result in utter chaos.
They are convinced that life is better when
those that are smarter (them) control the lives of everyone else. In
essence, Europe is like a giant religious cult in many ways (minus the
religion). With each passing year, the number of rules and regulations
governing the daily lives of Europeans steadily grows, as does the level of
control.
If you try to live outside of that control, you
could very well find yourself in a direct confrontation with the authorities
very rapidly.
Just consider what is happening in Germany.
Authorities there have stated repeatedly that they do not believe in having
any "parallel societies", and therefore everyone must participate in the
system that the government has established. That includes all children.
In Germany today, almost all forms
of homeschooling are illegal.
In fact, one judge shockingly ruled that one set
of parents could not have custody of their children because
they might move them to another country and home-school them
there...
A judge has issued a stunning verdict in a
homeschooling case in Germany, ordering that the parents cannot have
custody of their children because the family might move to another
country and home-school, posing a "concrete endangerment" to the
children.
Dirk and Petra Wunderlich's case made
international headlines in August when 20 armed police arrived with a
battering ram and forcibly took their four children from their home in
Darmstadt, Germany, and enrolled them in public school.
As WND reported at the time, the children,
ages 7 to 14, were taken into police custody.
They were allowed to return home three weeks
later when their father and mother, given no choice by the federal
bureaucracy in Germany, agreed to allow their kids to attend public
schools despite their objection to the social and religious instruction
there.
Are you starting to see what I meant when I
compared Europe to a cult? In Europe, government is god, and everyone and
everything belongs to the government.
Apparently, that even includes the life savings
of their own citizens.
The following is from a Reuters
article that was just posted this week
The
savings
of the European Union's 500 million citizens could be used
to fund long-term
investments to boost the
economy and help plug the gap left by
banks
since the financial crisis, an EU document says.
Did you catch that? The EU apparently believes
that they could use the private savings of their own citizens "to fund
long-term investments" any time that they want.
But what if you don't want your life savings to
be invested in that way? Too bad for you.
In fact, according to that Reuters article the
EU wants to find ways to "mobilize more personal pension savings" so that
there will be a larger pool with which to potentially fund long-term
projects
The Commission will
ask the bloc's insurance watchdog in the second half of this year for
advice on a possible draft law "to
mobilize more
personal pension savings for long-term financing", the document
said.
In Europe, they also tend to love any "Big
Brother" technologies that will allow them to watch, track, monitor and
record the activities of their citizens.
For example, it has been reported that in the UK
there are
1.85 million video cameras watching the
population, and London has been called "the
most watched city in the world".
The control freaks in the UK are so paranoid
that it is even illegal
to carry a knife in public, but despite all
of their crazy laws the rate of violent crime in the UK is still
far higher than it is in the United States.
Now, the UK has decided that all of the medical
records for the entire population will be gathered into a single database.
The following is from a
recent TechDirt article
The UK government is currently building a
database called care.data that will contain
all of England's medical records. It's
being promoted as providing valuable information for healthcare
management and medical researchers that
will lead to 'improved' treatment.
But this database will not be private.
In fact, it is being reported that information
from this database will be sold to
drug companies and insurance companies
Drug and insurance companies will from later
this year be able
to buy information on patients - including mental health
conditions and diseases such as cancer, as well as smoking and drinking
habits - once a single English database of medical data has been
created.
Harvested from GP and hospital records,
medical data covering the entire population will be uploaded to the
repository controlled by a new arms-length NHS information centre,
starting in March.
Never before has the entire medical history
of the nation been digitized and stored in one place.
How would you feel if that was being done to
your private medical information? Not that
the U.S. is a
'bastion of
freedom and liberty' these days either.
For example, Infowars
is reporting that the Department of Homeland Security plans to
launch a "national license plate tracking system"
The Department of Homeland Security is set
to activate a national license plate tracking system that will be shared
with law enforcement, allowing DHS officers to take photos of any
license plate using their Smartphone and upload it to a database which
will include a "hot list" of "target vehicles".
The details are included in a PDF attachment
uploaded yesterday to the Federal
Business Opportunities website under a solicitation entitled
"National License Plate Recognition Database."
The system will,
"track vehicle license plate numbers
that pass through cameras or are voluntarily entered into the system
from a variety of sources (access control systems, asset recovery
specialists, etc.) and uploaded to share with law enforcement" in
order to help locate "criminal aliens and absconders."
And for many more ways that the U.S. is becoming
a "Big Brother society", please see my previous article entitled "32
Privacy Destroying Technologies that Are Systematically Transforming America
into A Giant Prison".
Another way that America is becoming more like
Europe is in the area of religious behavior.
At one time, Europe was a hotbed for
religious faith. Of course those days are long gone. And the United
States is now heading down the exact same path, although Europe is still way
ahead of us.
The following is from a
Pew Research survey conducted a few years
ago
Half of Americans deem religion very
important in their lives; fewer than a quarter in Spain (22%), Germany
(21%), Britain (17%) and France (13%) share this view.
So why has
religion become so unimportant?
Well, it is because that is what the
government system tells them to believe from the time that they are
little children. As I mentioned earlier, the government dominates your life
from the beginning to the end in Europe. This even includes decisions about
ending your life.
In fact, in Belgium they actually want to extend
the euthanasia law to
children
Making the argument that everybody has the
right to die, Karine Lalieux, a Socialist member of the Belgian House,
is pushing legislation that would
extend the country's 2002 euthanasia law to minors
under 18.
"Our responsibility is to allow everybody to
live, but also to die, in dignity,'' said Lalieux.
And in the Netherlands they actually have
mobile euthanasia teams that go door to
door helping elderly people end their lives in the comfort of their own
homes.
Europe is not a model for the rest of us to
follow.
Instead, Europe should serve as a stark warning
to the rest of the world about what can happen when you let the control
freaks get too much control.
