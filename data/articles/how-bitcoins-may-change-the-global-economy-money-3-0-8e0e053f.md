# How Bitcoins May Change the Global Economy - Money 3.0

After the feds
seized and shuttered Silk Road, an online
marketplace for illegal drugs, earlier this
month, some technology experts started sounding
the death knell for Bitcoin, Silk Road's
international currency of choice.
Instead, we may soon
see Bitcoin's real value.
Invented in 2008,
Bitcoin is not the first
attempt at an all-digital, cryptographically based currency.
Others have existed in one form or another
for nearly fifty years, but have either failed to take off or
dramatically crashed and burned. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency
with the deep structure, wide adoption, and trading momentum to achieve
escape velocity.
In practice, Bitcoin blends credit cards'
ease of digital transfer with the relative anonymity of a cash handoff.
Like all currencies, the problems it poses are both practical and
metaphysical; like cash or credit, Bitcoin is somehow both more and less
real than the goods it is traded for.
Until now, the most well-known of these
goods have been illegal drugs, like those on Silk Road. But the drug
marketplace's shutdown gives Bitcoin a chance to gain some much-needed
legitimacy.
"It's a watershed moment for Bitcoin,"
Marco Santori, the chairman of the regulatory-affairs committee of
the Bitcoin Foundation,
told The New Yorker.
"Bitcoin's PR problem, with which it has
struggled for the last year or so, is being addressed in a very
direct way."
Bitcoin's future potential was a hot topic
this week at
emTech, an MIT conference on emerging technologies.
In a panel hosted by MIT Technology Review's
Tom Simonite, MIT economist David Johnson and BitPay CEO
Stephen Pair discussed Bitcoin's complex relationship with paper
currencies, credit, and state authority.
Johnson noted that buyers and sellers, banks
and governments all care deeply about what money is used for.
Money's use carries associations of value,
which in turn helps establish whether a currency, a payment form, and a
social model for transactions are legitimate.
"It's hard to bring any of them on board
if the money is associated with behaviors consumers are troubled
by," Johnson said at emTech.
"The key to the legitimacy of the system
for all of these parties is to establish that people using the
system are acting legally and responsibly."
In turn, Pair denied that Silk Road's
association with Bitcoin would prove fatal to the cryptocurrency.
"Silk Road used a lot of technologies.
First, it used the Internet. It also used Tor [a network using
"onion routing" relays to conceal a user's location identity] for
anonymity. And then it used Bitcoin for payments," said Pair.
Silk Road's shutdown,
"shows that just because you use Bitcoin
doesn't mean you can evade law enforcement."
If until now, Bitcoin has been a notorious
outlier, this is its chance to redefine itself as a mainstream
contender.
What is Bitcoin For?
If it's not to move drugs or launder money,
what is Bitcoin for?
Let's assume that the Silk Road arrests halt
or at least slow Bitcoin's use at the fringes of the law, at least until
those actors tighten up and regroup (and law enforcement does the same).
Let's further stipulate that the number of
people interested in Bitcoin as an academic exercise or as an
ideological argument about fiat currencies has (like the total number of
Bitcoins itself) a hard upper limit.
Pair and Johnson both argue that Bitcoin
still has tremendous potential doing what it was built to do: transfer
money from person to person without stopping for national borders or
rent-seeking middlemen.
Those people can be investors, merchants,
and even migrant workers, all participating in one of the largest,
strangest, but most elegant exchanges the world has ever seen.
Bitcoin's Origins
Bitcoin's invention is attributed to
Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for a person or group who, apart from
a 2008 paper introducing
Bitcoin, have remained anonymous and absent, a virtual author.
Bitcoin is backed by no government, and its
value isn't rooted in precious metals. Instead, it's distributed across
the entire network of users, its roots in complex digital mathematics.
Bitcoin supporters say that this makes the
currency immune to manipulation by politicians or oligarchs
seeking to move its value up or down for politics or profit.
"Bitcoin's integrity is guaranteed by
the rules of math and the laws of physics," Pair says.
Such rhetoric is common in the world of
digital currency, where reverence for Bitcoin has succeeded gold for
many hard-money enthusiasts.
They've entered into an uneasy and unusual
alliance with anarcho-technologists who
distrust government authority and believe in the power of
distributed networks and open-source software.
With governments' financial and credit
troubles in turn causing major problems for their currencies, global
investors are looking for something firmer than the promise of a central
bank.
In September, Tyler and Cameron
Winklevoss - Facebook bridesmaids turned Bitcoin entrepreneurs -
touted the digital currency as a solution to the world's troubled
currency markets.
"It's Gold 2.0," Tyler Winklevoss said.
Like gold or other precious metals used as
specie, Bitcoins are scarce. But their scarcity is algorithmic, as
opposed to natural or accidental.
New Bitcoins are added only by being
"mined," in the high-tech equivalent of a land rush. Computers on the
Bitcoin network race to solve increasingly complicated mathematical
problems. The first to do so has its solution verified by the other
nodes on the network.
Once verified, the Bitcoin can be traded
using Bitcoin's wallet software.
Bitcoin mining guarantees a fixed rate of
inflation (relative to itself). It roots the value of Bitcoins in the
work needed to solve the puzzle. And the decentralized proof-of-work
consensus protocol guards against fraud and counterfeit.
In Pair's words, Bitcoin
"commoditized the process of securing
the network."
All the work done by financial centers and
payment systems to detect fraud or counterfeit for traditional currency
and credit markets is done all along the network according to the
peer-to-peer protocols for Bitcoin.
And the costs of that work are likewise
distributed throughout the system, paid for through Bitcoin mining. This
is what lets Bitcoins be traded and exchanged without huge fees.
There are a little over 11.78 million
bitcoins in circulation, with a total capitalization of 1.6 billion
USD, and typically somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000 bitcoin
transactions each day.
As more and more computers participate in
bitcoin mining - daily unique bitcoin addresses reached a high of over
100,000 this summer - and the mathematical problems needed to earn new
bitcoins have grown more complicated, the average operating margin for
miners has plummeted.
Mining has switched from being a frontier
gold rush to a relatively mainstream, industrial-grade operation.
Digital Currency's
Future
Today, essentially every digital transaction
and every international transaction involves a use of one form or
another of virtual currency or credit.
Transaction and exchange fees, taxes, and
payment delays exist to provide short-term credit, guard against
counterfeit, excessive withdrawals and other kinds of fraud, and to
extract income.
Bitcoin is designed to provide the same
security guarantees and convenience of credit, while foregoing its extra
processing times and fees.
You settle with Bitcoin immediately, just
like cash. Unlike a credit card exchange, where your credit card number
and security information are handed over completely for any transaction,
a transfer is authorized only to pay a specific amount.
In principle, Bitcoin's independence makes
it more stable than traditional currencies like Dollars or Euros. In
reality, its value has fluctuated wildly over its four-year-existence.
Today, the price of one Bitcoin has
stabilized at about $140 US; it briefly dipped down to $121 USD after
Silk Road's shutdown, but quickly rallied back. But just a year ago, the
price of a Bitcoin seemed stable at about $12 USD. Those are some wild
swings.
The exchange values matter, both to people
who mine or invest in Bitcoins and to users who want to use them for
everyday goods and services, which are usually denominated in local
currency. (Local currency is also used to pay taxes, which Bitcoin
transactions sometimes try to avoid.)
But what Bitcoin also does is make digital
payments possible for people who not only don't have PayPal, but don't
have a functioning credit system.
In many parts of Africa, Latin America, and
south Asia, most people have no access to credit or digital payments;
with Bitcoin, that infrastructure comes for free.
Pair's company,
BitPay, converts Bitcoins back and forth into various local
currencies without charging a transaction fee. (Instead, it charges a
flat monthly rate.)
Its clients include hosting companies,
computer and electronic equipment companies, and companies that sell
internationally.
"With Bitcoin, you can take an
international payment with no risk of credit card fraud," says Pair.
"We sometimes forget that there are many
countries where you can't take a credit card payment. Those
countries become isolated from the rest of the Internet economy...
For many of these countries, if this payment system works, if the
U.S. and Congress can support and tolerate a reputable, well-paid
industry, this will be a big connector to the world economy."
The area with the biggest potential for
Bitcoin worldwide is probably international remittances:
money sent home by workers living
abroad.
Currently, this money has to be handled by
several intermediaries:
banks, wire services, and currency
exchanges all take their cut.
A recent
report by Businessweek noted that the average fee for
remittances was 9 percent of the money transferred, with conversion to
cash often costing an extra 5 percent.
Western Union's profit margins are enormous
for an intermediary, nearly 16 percent, and most of its costs are
devoted to the technologies moving money from one place to another,
guaranteeing the legitimacy of the transfer.
In short, Western Union spends and earns
billions to do what Bitcoin does for free.
Instead of Western Union, migrant workers
(or businesses operating on their behalf) could use Bitcoin to send
payments from one country to another through email, without worry of
fraud or needing to support an elaborate exchange or credit market.
It would be real-time, immediate settlement
at a fraction of the cost.
In ten years, instead of international
drugs, Bitcoin could act as a genuine lingua franca for international
work.
"The vast majority of the planet don't
even own a bank account," Bitcoin evangelist Jonathan Mohan
tells PBS Newshour (below video).
"And it's my contention that - and a lot
of people think this - that, just as in Africa, they didn't go to
phones. They went directly to cell phones, that, in the same sort of
adoption curve, in these developing nations, you're not going to see
them start getting bank accounts.
You're going to see them just going
straight to Bitcoins, because if you own a Bitcoin address, you have
a bank account on your phone that you can interact on the global
stage with."
There are still real problems.
Johnson thinks that Bitcoin has yet to
suffer its first genuine crisis of legitimacy, and its proponents
haven't developed a political strategy to reassure wary states and
investors that the currency can play nice. And the rhetoric of many
Bitcoin proponents assumes a sophisticated understanding of its
underlying technology that is far from widespread, especially among the
world's poor.
Investors and miners can debate the nuances
of different cryptographic schema, but for most of us, money is
ultimately an article of faith.
Money 3.0
It seems inevitable that money, already
virtual, will only become more so as we shift into a digital economy.
"Money has become data," Ben Milne,
founder of Dwolla, a real-time payments company, said at emTech.
"There needs to be an infrastructure that allows people to exchange
whatever they have for whatever they want, that confirms who they
are, and confirms that the transaction is legitimate."
He notes that while today, credit cards
handle trillions of dollars in transactions, ACH's virtual transfers
where no physical money changes hands handle tens of trillions.
If digital companies or currencies can make
these transactions more secure, more efficient, and more immediate, that
can unlock value for everyone, even some of the companies that currently
benefit from the high barrier of entry to traditional banking.
And Bitcoin can still affect the world
economy even if it does not become a currency that everyone uses or
understands.
"If Bitcoin becomes widespread,
respected, and legitimate, that pressures everyone - all the central
banks and banking companies - to bring down those costs in order to
stay competitive," Johnson says.
"Or everyone could just use Bitcoin,"
adds Pair.
