Confounding was the Australian's (newspaper)
recent op-ed titled, "Death
of a ruthless autocrat," in regards to the late Hugo Chavez.
Confounding not for the op-ed's condemnation of
socialist policies or its criticism of Hugo Chavez, an obstruction to
Western corporate-financier interests in South America for over a decade,
but because of the obscene hypocrisy displayed throughout, from a newspaper
and
a corporate-financier-academic establishment in Australia that coddles a
figure in nearby Thailand that is every bit as guilty of everything it
accuses Chavez of.
When is
blood-red socialism ok (Thailand) and when is it "ruthless
autocracy" (Venezuela)?
The
answer depends on whether or not you serve Wall Street and
London's international order.
Contrary to popular belief, socialism is not a unified
global ideology and is instead like
any
tool - only as good or bad as the hands it finds itself in.
The use
of socialism by two governments no more indicates an
affiliation than would guns
in the hands of two
opposing armies on a battlefield.
The piece begins with:
HE was lionized as a hero by the Western
Left, of course, but it would be hard to find a leader in recent history
who more comprehensively betrayed the wellbeing of his country than
Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez.
He was driven by an irrational, demagogic
and self-defeating antagonism towards Washington that blinded him to his
nation's best interests.
The rambling narrative of the Australian equates
to condemning Venezuela for not opening itself up to Western exploitation,
domination by corporate-financier monopolies, and the folly of its
challenging of the West's campaign of global aggression to,
-
Mali
-
Libya
-
Syria
-
Pakistan
-
Afghanistan
-
Iraq
In fact, the Australian itself makes a point of
condemning Chavez for his support of Saddam Hussein, who's nation was
occupied by the West during a brutal 10 year war, following a decade of
sanctions that in total cost the lives of over 2 million Iraqis (including
half a million children) and still counting.
The Australian implies that Chavez was wrong to
support Iraq, despite documented evidence that the Western assault on Iraq
was waged upon a patently false pretense.
The Australian condemns Chavez' "populist economics" and ends its piece by
stating:
Thumbing your nose at Washington and
aligning your country with the world's worst dictatorships is a recipe
for disaster. Those who come after Mr Chavez should see that and change
course.
Thumbing your nose at Washington and its
interests is indeed a recipe for disaster, as has been thumbing your nose at
brutal empires throughout human history.
Your nation will become the target of covert
military operations, terrorism, political subversion, and economic sabotage,
the very root of Venezuela's current malaise. Thumb your nose long and hard
enough at the West, and you may even become subject to an outright invasion,
as was the case in Iraq, Libya, Vietnam, and Afghanistan. Or, you may suffer
a long-term proxy war, as Syria now faces.
In reality, the Australian reveals what Hugo Chavez was really guilty of.
Not of being a "ruthless autocrat," or of being
a socialist, but of being independent and for having the nerve to challenge
the extraterritorial interests of an increasingly violent and unhinged West.
Thaksin Shinawatra
Populist, Socialist, Ruthless Autocrat, and Darling of
the West.
Of course, the most preposterous statement of the Australian's op-ed would
easily be,
"but it would be hard to find a leader in
recent history who more comprehensively betrayed the wellbeing of his
country than Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez."
The Australian might start with Thaksin
Shinawatra of Thailand, propped up and coddled by the West since the
1990's, and to this day given free passage throughout the West despite being
a convicted criminal and a fugitive from the law in his native country.
The Australian's editorial board itself has lent support to his despotic,
nepotist regime, currently led by his own sister, Yingluck Shinawatra,
defending him as a progressive, pro-democratic force in Thailand.
In
a 2011 Australian news article preceding Thailand's national elections,
no where is found the same venomous language directed at Chavez in
describing Thaksin's own populist/socialist schemes. No mention at all is
made of Thaksin's grotesque human rights record - the worst in Thai history,
his intimidation of the press, and his habitual assault on any and all who
challenge him.
Indeed, while the Australian calls Hugo Chavez a "ruthless autocrat," it was
Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand who mass murdered 3,000 innocent people over
the course of 90 days during a so-called "war on drugs" where police were
sent into the streets to conduct extrajudicial executions.
It would later be determined that most of the
those murdered were not even involved in the drug trade. Human Rights Watch
(HRW) would confirm this in their 2008 report titled, "Thailands
'war on drugs'," a follow up to the much more extensive 2004 report, "Not
Enough Graves."
To this day Thaksin counts his "war on drugs" as one of the many highlights
of his 2001-2006 stint in office.
And while the Australian fails to remind
readers of this inconvenient fact, other Western propagandists, such as the
Economist, boldly defend the mass murder that took place under his ruthless
regime.
In its op-ed titled, "Thailand's
drug wars: Back on the offensive," the Economist states:
Faced with soaring methamphetamine abuse, Mr
Thaksin ordered the police to draw up blacklists of suspected
traffickers and to act decisively and without mercy.
The Economist would also go on to say:
On the streets of Khlong Toey, the largest
slum in Bangkok, there is nostalgia for Mr Thaksin's iron-fisted drugs
policy. The 2003 crackdown drove up prices, smashed trafficking networks
and forced addicts into rehabilitation programs.
In drug-ravaged communities, where the ends
tend to justify the means, that was enough to turn Mr Thaksin into a
hero.
The Economist finishes its op-ed by lamenting
that the then military-led government which ousted Thaksin in 2006, had not
kept up Thaksin's abhorrent, extrajudicial campaign of mass murder:
You might expect a military junta with
sweeping powers to have kept up the fight against such illicit activity.
Anti-narcotics officials say that drug seizures have risen since the
military coup in September 2006.
And more recently, the Huffington Post hosted
Stanley Weiss of the Business Executives for National Security
(BENS) and his op-ed titled, "The
Oracle of Thailand," where he praises Thaksin Shinawatra's
populist-socialist policies and suggests the US would be better off if it
applied his "Thaksinomics" across America.
Weiss openly admits that Thaksin Shinawatra,
despite being a convicted criminal and living in exile, is running the
country by nepotist proxy.
Yet, he defends what he considers a brilliant
exploitation of Thailand's desperately poor, notoriously under-educated
rural population, spinning it as:
The great innovation of Thaksin and Pansak
(along with U.S.-trained academic Somkid Jatusripitak) was "the
increased role of government in the allocation of credit," as
Chulalongkorn University Professor Pasuk Phongpaichit writes.
But not just anywhere:
"Thaksinomics" focused the government's
attention on the poor and rural areas of Thailand. Arguing that "a
country is a company and a company is a country," the self-described
"CEO Prime Minister" approached the national economy like a business,
looking for ways, as Pasuk explains, to "mobilize any dormant or
unexploited assets including unused natural resources and neglected
human resources."
Tapping unused reserves of credit in the state
banking system, the team created one rural credit fund after another.
To lower household expenses, they offered
low-cost housing and health insurance; provided subsidized credit for buying
taxis and provided loans for children to get to school.
One might wonder how that is any different than
what Hugo Chavez did in Venezuela, who also won over the population in part
by using state money to subsidize his support base.
The difference is
simple:
Hugo Chavez used socialism to co-opt the population in opposition to
the Wall Street-London international order, while Thaksin Shinawatra co-opted
Thailand's rural poor on behalf of Wall Street and London's interests.
Weiss' BENS front
is lined with
representatives of America's Fortune 500 who have played a pivotal role
in both Thaksin' rise to power, and his continued relevance in Thai
politics.
Thaksin had been prime minister from 2001-2006. Long before Thaksin
Shinawatra would become prime minister in Thailand, he was already working
his way up the Wall Street-London ladder of opportunity, while
simultaneously working his way up in Thai politics.
He was
appointed by the Carlyle
Group as an adviser while holding public office, and attempted to use
his connections to boost his political image.
Thanong Khanthong of Thailand's English
newspaper "the Nation,"
wrote in 2001:
"In April 1998, while Thailand was still
mired in a deep economic morass, Thaksin tried to use his American
connections to boost his political image just as he was forming his Thai
Rak Thai Party.
He invited Bush senior to visit Bangkok and
his home, saying his own mission was to act as a "national matchmaker"
between the US equity fund and Thai businesses.
In March, he also played host to James Baker
III, the US secretary of state in the senior Bush administration, on his
sojourn in Thailand."
Upon becoming prime minister in 2001, Thaksin
would begin paying back the support he received from his Western sponsors.
In 2003, he would
commit Thai troops to the US invasion of Iraq, despite widespread
protests from both the Thai military and the public.
Thaksin would also
allow
the CIA to use Thailand for its abhorrent rendition program.
In 2004, Thaksin attempted to ramrod through a
US-Thailand Free-Trade Agreement (FTA) without parliamentary approval,
backed by the US-ASEAN
Business Council who just before 2011's elections that saw Thaksin's
sister Yingluck Shinawatra brought into power, hosted the leaders of
Thaksins "red shirt" "United Front for Democracy
against Dictatorship" (UDD).
The
US-ASEAN Business Council,
a whos-who of corporate fascism in the US, had been
approached by leaders of Thaksin Shinwatra's "red
shirt" street mobs. (click image to enlarge)
The
council in 2004
included,
-
3M
-
war profiteering Bechtel
-
Boeing
-
Cargill
-
Citigroup
-
General Electric
-
IBM
-
the notorious
Monsanto,
...and
currently also includes,
Deposed autocrat, Thaksin Shinawatra
before the CFR on the even of the 2006 military coup that would oust
him from power. Since 2006 he has had the full, unflinching support of
Washington, Wall Street and their immense propaganda machine in his bid
to seize back power.
Thaksin would remain in office until September of 2006.
On the eve of the
military coup that ousted him from power, Thaksin was literally standing
before the Fortune
500-funded Council on Foreign Relations
giving a progress report in New York City.
Since the 2006 coup that toppled his regime, Thaksin has been represented by
US corporate-financier elites via their lobbying firms including,
Robert Amsterdam of Amsterdam & Peroff, would also simultaneously represent
Thaksin's "red shirt" UDD movement, and was present for the inaugural
meeting of the
so-called "academic" Nitirat group, attended mostly by pro-Thaksin red
shirts (who literally wore their red shirts to the meeting).
Additional
support for Thaksin and his UDD street-front is provided by the US State
Department via National Endowment for Democracy-funded "NGO"
Prachatai."
Time to Grow Up
It is time for the general population to refine their understanding of
socioeconomic-political processes.
Socialism is not an internationally
unified political ideology. It is a set of tools that is only as good or as
bad as the hands that wield them. And just because these tools can be found
in two different hands, does not mean that both hands serve the same agenda
- no more so than would guns in two opposing armies' hands indicate a mutual
agenda or alliance.
Hugo Chavez used socialism to build a support base, because if he didn't,
Wall Street and London would do it themselves
with their proxy opposition front in Venezuela - just as they have done
in Thailand with Thaksin Shinawatra.
The proof is in the West's own narrative, where they hypocritically
celebrate Thaksin Shinawatra's "Thaksinomics" while condemning Chavez' "Chavismo."
It would appear that socialism is only "ok" if it is used to co-opt the
population for the interests of Wall Street and London. "Thumb your nose" at
the West, and it doesn't matter what socioeconomic strategy you employ, you
are a "ruthless autocrat" whose days are numbered and whose memory will be
immediately defiled upon your passing.
Governments do not adhere to political ideologies, they simply use them when
and where profitable. In the US where
a corporate-financier oligarchy literally writes the policy for
politicians on both sides of the aisle, the use of socialism and
"free market" economics is done in tandem to achieve a multitude of goals
that would be impossible using only one or the other.
While the West itself
placates its population with socialism, such policies are condemned when
employed contra to their interests, especially when used to galvanize a
population against Western advances - as was the case in Chavez' Venezuela.
In reality, socialism is but a single tool. An entire nation cannot be
sustained upon it, no more than an entire house can be built using only a
hammer.
The true test of a government is not whether it uses socialism or
not, but with what other tools it employs it. A nation must seek to build
upon socialism's stop-gaps
with sustainable, pragmatic solutions.
Outside of Wall Street and
London's international order, many nations are doing just that, but progress
is difficult to gauge when the West arrays the summation of its influence
and power against such progress.
The general population's habit of perceiving socialism, capitalism, or any
other socioeconomic system as a unifying ideology is folly.
The ruling
elite, whichever side they stand on, do not see such systems as unifying
ideologies, but merely tools. It is time for the general population to look
at how these tools are used, and whose hands they are actually in, instead
of fixating on the tool itself as being inherently "good" or "bad."
The story of Chavez and Thaksin illustrates the double standards and
hypocrisy hidden in plain sight and casts doubts on narratives proposing
anyone using "socialism" is part of a unified global cabal. Such a notion
falls flat unless financial and political ties can be documented.
In the
case of
Hugo Chavez and Venezuela, the chasm between his movement and the
West's use of socialism couldn't be any deeper or wider.
