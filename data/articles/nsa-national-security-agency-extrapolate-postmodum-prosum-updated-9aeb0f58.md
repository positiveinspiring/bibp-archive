Numerous articles about the NSA have been circulated.
Any and all that dismiss the AT&T-Israeli-Mossad-Unit
8200-Converse-Boeing connection(s) are either intentionally misleading or
unintentionally dilettante whereas
this
link was merely part of a greater learning curve.
This article has sources that cannot be named;
however, feel free to ask your elected officials about buckeyball euthanasia
vacuum shells...
It is the intention of this article to look at the "intelligence community"
in an entirely new way.
For starters, Glen Greenwald and the
Guardian crew wrote about the NSA a full six years after a friend of mine
stumbled across
NSA Prism. Let's look at the NSA/Greenwald/Guardian
"intelligence" a bit differently
It is nearly fall 2014:
the email, websurfing, cell-phone,
land-phone-line snooping and TV channel-surfing data mining mentioned by
the Guardian,
...is vintage 1990's technology.
Mining data from internetwork-datagrams is
partying like it's 1999, albeit with only a few new tweaks and perks.
The trouble with NSA-Guardianesque-articles is that nobody asks the
gestational question(s):
-
Does the NSA do wet-work
(assassinations) domestically?
-
Is Congress and the Senate okay with
snooping on one's self?
-
Are all 535 Senators, Congressman, as
well as Obama's 23-Cabinet and even more voluminous
Junior-Cabinet-members on-board with the NSA's agenda?
Such an NSA coup de gr√¢ce with everyone both
fully aware and willing party to domestic wet-work (legal party to domestic
murders) seems highly unlikely; such scenario would mean
the U.S.
CIA is onboard with shooting itself in the foot.
The problem with the NOW'ers is one is supposed
to lump the right-wing 1942 OSS (Office Strategic Services) in with the
left-wing 2014 NSA/Prism.
Pardon the crude epithet, but let's all back the
fuck up, a moment, this is both a journalism phopaw and damned important
Calling any and all NOW'ers, gun and food hoarders, extreme right-wingers,
left-wing-to-the-point-of-facism'ers
Do you believe that the OSS has morphed into
being on board with the NSA, Morgellon's Disease, Domestic wet-work, and
listening to you tinkle in a commode?
Perhaps this is a good time to ponder the
difference between two acronym buzzwords,
"Security" and "Intelligence".
Does having a case-manager listen to you tinkle
in the commode sound intelligent to you; or, rather, does it sound "secure"?
The NSA is running five programs that are known as "the program"; three of
the five end in jail, mental hospitals or violent crime. The other two NSA
programs end in a brutal, macabre murder with no corpse or viable DNA left
behind.
These last two programs are currently being shut
down by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency; the CIA would like very much
not to be put into a NWO/NSA/N.O.W./mass-media category.
The CIA's main product is, after all,
intelligence.
The CIA is doing more wet-work domestically
than abroad at this time and it is to the CIA's benefit rather than to my
own that this paper is written.
The NSA and their followers have caused tens-of-thousands and perhaps more
"missing-persons-cases"
Perhaps the three questions above are not the enceinte question. If the NSA
has determined that running a covert murder-ring of American citizens is
"Secure", then it is more plausible and more possible than not that the CIA
has found it more Intelligent than not to snuff, smoke, wet-work, et al NSA
employees.
One of my prior articles mentioned NSA-phase-one and phase-three employees
as a basketful
of psycho-sociopaths.
The phase four/five assassins of the NSA are
just more psycho-sociopaths. Now imagine 100 of these psychopaths
disappearing simultaneously off of the face of the Earth for keeps, no DNA,
no trace of any kind left behind because the CIA finds their disappearances
an "Intelligent" act for the country.
Let's grind the ideology down to the Foie Gras:
the NSA and 50% or more of the government
says NSA domestic wet-work is legal, righteous and necessary; 50% or
less say the Central **INTELLIGENCE** Agency needs to snuff out any and
all psycho-sociopath assassins.
One side has the left and the media (NSA).
The other side has the Catholics, Protestants, Lutherans, Methodists, Cops,
Highway Patrol, Sheriffs, State Police and Troopers, Oathkeepers, Veterans,
active duty Troops, National Guard and anyone who identifies self as
"patriotic, keeper of the U.S. Constitution," and/or "religious other"
(Mormons, Quakers, Buddhists, etc.).
There is a covert but extremely deadly war going
on in the U.S. The attrition rate at this time is about 50 NSA dead per 1
(one) CIA dead.
The NSA developed a brass and
buckeyball hybrid metal vacuum shell with a
buckeyball and fabric siphon hose that vacuums up a human being, shoes,
clothes, hair, DNA and all in 2-3 minutes.
The persons who have done this to
America and their families are paying for it by disappearing in a very like
manner in many respects except they do so en masse rather than
one-at-a-time.
There are two-three things that hopefully already came to your mind:
-
Pray for the CIA, which is absolutely
not an NOW conspiracy. Many very brave and extremely anonymous
heroes have and are dying in a cause to make your life better
-
These are not secret (below image):
neither is Mellon Bank, etc. Support CIA-friendly concerns if you
can, do so for your family.
-
Stop feeding the NOW-nonsense. The
Mossad, the CIA and the U.S. Military, State and local law are all
on one-side. The other side is media, NSA and corrupt politicians.
The Mossad and CIA do not aim weapons at their own feet.

The
http://olivebiodiesel.com/ page has been updated many times; what
the concept has lacked was time for both human cooperation to evolve and
time for olive saplings and seedlings to grow.
Recently, I saw a "diesel" big-rig (2-cycle motor) running on propane. Most
striking about it were the amount of power with an absence of sound, smoke
and soot. At the El Monte, California bus terminal, only one (1) bus still
runs on diesel, the rest of the fleet runs on 'natural gas', aka CNG.
Most of the local City and County large "diesel"
vehicles now run on CNG.
The more private companies can convert or
replace fleets with CNG vehicles, the more companies and their customers
will see familiar pricing on an ongoing basis. Part of what impressed me
about the CNG big rig (aside from it being a CIA-truck) was very quiet,
rapid rpm wind-up (high torque-curve) with no smoke whatsoever, no soot.
While the NSA was inventing ways to listen to
us all pass gas and ways to kill our own, the CIA was trying to plod a
way for all 328,000 of us to make our ways through the future.
The NSA death squads are dying and disbanding rapidly.
While
ISIS and
ISIL cut off heads abroad, the CIA is
rapidly cutting the head off of the NSA.
The plan was for
the
Oligarchs to hide in Antarctica while hydro, medical cannabis
moves a death gene through the useless-eaters populace. That is the NSA plan
for American's future, death by hydro-cannabis.
The CIA figured we might all survive that plan
and be in need of meat trucks, bread trucks, etc. Don't think hydro, think
Compressed Natural Gas - if you farm, think CNG combines rather than
diesel for the future.
What were those guys thinking?
