From the beginning, even for those wanting to believe
the fairy tale that
9/11 was carried out by cave dwellers carrying box cutters directed by Osama
Bin Laden, who by all accounts was dying or already dead from kidney failure
in 2001 - "unfortunate blunders" in US foreign policy can still be blamed
for the creation and perpetuation of the ubiquitous, unceasing terror
organization known as Al Qaeda.
However, in light of recent events in Libya,
Syria, Iran, and Algeria, there is exposed a truth, many have known for over
10 years, and many more are catching onto now - that the "War on Terror" is
an absolute fraud, started, fueled and simultaneously fought against by the
same handful of corporate-financier interests for the sole purpose of
spreading Wall Street and London's hegemony across the globe.
Inception - Al Qaeda Made in USA
By all accounts, including admissions by former Secretary of Defense Robert
Gates and former National Security Adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Osama Bin
Laden's organization that would become Al Qaeda was created during the
Soviet-Afghan war in in the late 70's and throughout the 80's.
The funding
of these militants did not begin after the Soviet invasion, but actually
several years before the invasion.
US intervention in Afghanistan by
training and arming Afghanistan's Mujaheddin, along with Osama Bin Laden's
Arab fighters, is one of the leading factors that led to the murderous and
protracted decade-long war, according to the Nation in an article titled,
"Blowback, the Prequel."
Former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski meeting with
Osama Bin Laden,
then leading the CIA's Arab legionaries in Afghanistan.
Bin
Laden's Al Qaeda would later spin off into regional terrorist organizations,
covertly armed, trained, and protected by the CIA to this day,
including LIFG in Libya, MEK in Iraq and Iran, and Baluchi terrorists in Pakistan.
Bin Laden's Al Qaeda would continue to fight after the Soviets were expelled
from Afghanistan, this time in Kosovo's bid for independence from Serbia in
the late 1990's.
Al Qaeda-trained Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) militants
garnered a Serbian response which was then used by NATO as a pretext for
intervention. NATO's entry into the war led to the eventual carving up of
the nation.
Again, the CIA was found to be propping up Bin Laden's terrorist
legionaries. Serbia's president, Slobodan MiloeviÄ‡ would later be removed
from power by yet another arm of American interventionism, the National
Endowment for Democracy
via Optor, now known as the
infamous CANVAS
organization which, with US funding, trained activists ahead of the now
admittedly
US-engineered "Arab Spring."
Despite Al Qaeda quickly becoming America's arch enemy, filling the void
left by a collapsed Soviet Union, and justifying America's continued absurd
defense spending as well as its enormous tactical holdings overseas
throughout the 90's, it appears the organization was still very much a
vehicle carrying forward US foreign policy.
And despite accusations that it
was a terrorist organization, it continued receiving covert support from US
and British intelligence agencies, as did many other extremist groups which
eventually were integrated with Al Qaeda after September 11, 2001.
From Heroes to Villains, and Back Again
In the 80's when the CIA was fueling Afghanistan's decade-long war with the
Soviet Union, in part provoked by US meddling in the region years before the
invasion even took place, the Mujaheddin were portrayed as heroes and
freedom fighters quite publicly.
No better example can be cited of how this
image was nurtured by the West's massive propaganda machine than Hollywood's
Rambo III, an entire movie literally dedicated to the "gallant people of
Afghanistan."
Many of those that fought in Afghanistan, particularly foreign
fighters armed, trained, and brought in by the CIA, would go on to become
some of the world's most notorious terrorist groups, many of which are
listed to this day on the US and UK foreign terrorist organization lists.
(Top)
Rambo meets the Afghan Mujaheddin, who aid him in his heroic
exploits.
These people would later fight US invaders after expelling the
Soviets.
(Bottom) The credits for Rambo III begin with this dedication to
the "gallant people of Afghanistan."
Throughout the film, the Mujaheddin are
depicted as "freedom fighters"
much in the same light as the current Libyan
rebels are.
In short time, these "gallant" "freedom fighters" would become
America's arch enemies
and the subject of a 10 year occupation that is still
ongoing.
More recently, Rambo IV featured Myanmar - still called "Burma" by
neo-imperialists - and was used
in a similar manner to portray an entire
nation as the US State Department saw fit.
The film is being used by
US-backed youth group "Generation Wave" as propaganda,
just as the US State
Department intended.
These CIA-fostered terrorist groups include the
Libyan Islamic Fighting
Group (LIFG), which was created in Afghanistan with Libyan militants
previously armed and trained by the CIA to overthrow Qaddafi in the early
1980's.
After Afghanistan, and several failed attempts to seize Libya by
force, these fighters would filter back into Afghanistan to fight US troops
who were now invading the "gallant people of Afghanistan."
This time, the
Afghans were no longer "gallant," but rather medieval savages in need of
Western democracy and UN sanctioned nation-building.
The Libyans for their
part would continue fighting the US in Afghanistan, and when the US invaded
Iraq in 2003, they would begin fighting US troops there as well. This is of
course, all
according to a report from the West Point Combating Terror
Center.
And even as US forces occupy Afghanistan for their tenth year, with fighting
reaching unprecedented levels of violence, Afghanistan's LIFG Libyan cohorts
are receiving US and British air support,
French and
Qatari arms, billions
in aid,
NATO special forces assistance, and full diplomatic recognition by
the US State Department and the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, as they
rise up against Qaddafi in Libya.
It must be noted that these Libyan rebels,
who like the Afghan Mujahedin were portrayed as "freedom fighters," are in
fact led and consist almost entirely of LIFG militants, many of whom have
spent time in Iraq and Afghanistan killing US troops. It should be noted
that LIFG is listed by the US Stated Department (#26) and the
UK Home Office
as a foreign terrorist organization.
This is a narrative that first saw these militants as heroes, then the
world's most scorned villains for nearly a decade of war, before emerging
out the other side once again as heroes.
For the thousands of US troops who
have died in Iraq and Afghanistan, the tens of thousands maimed, and the
hundreds of millions of Americans facing a bankrupted nation that has paid
trillions for this "War on Terror" to unproportionately wealthy
mega-corporations and banks, it is becoming clear that they were taken for a
ride by a shadowy elite with an obscure agenda masked in a now unraveling
veil of lies.
The War on Terror is Actively Kept Alive by the West
In Libya, Qaddafi has fought for nearly three decades to crush the extremist
militants of Libya's eastern region, centered on the cities of Darnah and
the current epicenter of the NATO-backed rebellion, Benghazi.
This eastern
region is considered, according to West Point's CTC report, as one of the
highest concentrations of terrorists in the world. It is also a region the
CIA and MI6 have helped fund, arm, and train over the same 30 years.
At one point, Qaddafi had almost entirely extinguished the movement, in
particular LIFG, most of whose leadership fled, and ironically sought refuge
in London, Langley, and Washington. Qaddafi would attempt to re-approach the
West by abandoning his WMD programs and inviting Western intelligence
agencies in to help counter the remnants of LIFG and other regional terror
organizations.
The CIA and MI6 instead, rearmed, reorganized, and redirected
these terrorist organizations back at the Qaddafi regime culminating in the
February 17, 2011 "Day of Rage" and the subsequent NATO intervention.
Indeed, the US, UK, France, Qatar, and other NATO member states are overtly
deposing Qaddafi in favor for a regime made up of hardcore terrorists.
In other words, a terrorist organization on its death bed, was intentionally
brought back to life by NATO. Having done so, LIFG is already shipping
weapons to another notorious terrorist organization in the region,
Algeria's
Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM) (#37 on US State Department's list of
foreign terrorist organizations).
Algeria, like Libya, has fought a long
battle against terrorism at the cost of protracted unrest now known as the
"lost decade." After a failed attempt at stirring regime change in Algeria
through Egyptian-style street protests and internal defections, it appears
the US through NATO is attempting to revive AQIM and initiate a violent
revolution.
Already,
Bruce Riedel, a Brookings Institution policy wonk and co-author of
the "Which
Path to Persia?" report engineering the use of terrorism to
destabilize Iran, is licking his chops over the prospects of Algeria "being
next."
In a report, aptly titled, "Algeria will be next to fall," Riedel
sets the rhetorical stage, just as he helped to do with Libya, for another
"spontaneous" "indigenous" uprising, with the prospect of NATO, and more
specifically, French intervention looming over them. In reality, as we can
clearly see, AQIM would not be in any position were it not for NATO arming
and handing a neighboring nation to their allies amongst Libya's LIFG.
Similarly in Syria, the
Muslim Brotherhood was all but routed by Bashar
al-Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad.
Now, these militants are
receiving covert
arms, the full support of the Western media's selective journalism, and both
political and financial support by the US, UK, and EU. Should the West
succeed, yet another extremist organization will be reanimated and unleashed
on a population that has sacrificed much trying to burying it.
Iran has been fighting a battle against another State Department listed
terrorist organization (list as #28), Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK.) US policy
makers, after admitting MEK has the blood of US soldiers and civilians on
its hands and that it has "undeniably" conducted terrorist attacks,
shockingly wants to remove it from the US foreign terrorist organization
list so that it can be worked with more closely in toppling the Iranian
government.
This is revealed in the Brookings Institution's "Which Path to
Persia?" report.
"Potential Ethnic Proxies," page 117-118 (page 130-131 of the PDF):
"Perhaps
the most prominent (and certainly the most controversial) opposition group
that has attracted attention as a potential U.S. proxy is the NCRI (National
Council of Resistance of Iran), the political movement established by the
MEK (Mujahedin-e Khalq). Critics believe the group to be undemocratic and
unpopular, and indeed anti-American.
In contrast, the groups champions contend that the movements long-standing
opposition to the Iranian regime and record of successful attacks on and
intelligence-gathering operations against the regime make it worthy of U.S.
support. They also argue that the group is no longer anti-American and
question the merit of earlier accusations.
Raymond Tanter, one of the
groups supporters in the United States, contends that the MEK and the NCRI
are allies for regime change in Tehran and also act as a useful proxy for
gathering intelligence. The MEKs greatest intelligence coup was the
provision of intelligence in 2002 that led to the discovery of a secret site
in Iran for enriching uranium.
Despite its defenders claims, the MEK remains on the U.S. government list
of foreign terrorist organizations. In the 1970s, the group killed three
U.S. officers and three civilian contractors in Iran. During the 1979-1980
hostage crisis, the group praised the decision to take America hostages and
Elaine Sciolino reported that while group leaders publicly condemned the
9/11 attacks, within the group celebrations were widespread.
Undeniably, the group has conducted terrorist attacks
- often excused by the MEKs advocates because they are directed against the Iranian government.
For example, in 1981, the group bombed the headquarters of the Islamic
Republic Party, which was then the clerical leaderships main political
organization, killing an estimated 70 senior officials. More recently, the
group has claimed credit for over a dozen mortar attacks, assassinations,
and other assaults on Iranian civilian and military targets between 1998 and
2001.
At the very least, to work more closely with the group (at least in an
overt manner), Washington would need to remove it from the list of foreign
terrorist organizations."
It turns out that MEK is already receiving US funding, weapons, and other
assistance to conduct a militant campaign against the government of Iran.
This was revealed in Seymour Hersh's New Yorker article "Preparing the
Battlefield," which stated:
"The M.E.K. has been on the State Departments terrorist list for more than
a decade, yet in recent years the group has received arms and intelligence,
directly or indirectly, from the United States. Some of the newly authorized
covert funds, the Pentagon consultant told me, may well end up in M.E.K.
coffers.
The new task force will work with the M.E.K. The Administration is
desperate for results.
He added, The M.E.K. has no C.P.A. auditing the
books, and its leaders are thought to have been lining their pockets for
years. If people only knew what the M.E.K. is getting, and how much is going
to its bank accounts - and yet it is almost useless for the purposes the
Administration intends.
Moves have also been made to
get MEK de-listed as a terrorist organization
by the US State Department so that even more aid can be rendered to this
admitted terrorist organization.
Seymore Hersh in
an NPR interview, also
claims that select MEK members have received training in the US. Also
implicated by Hersh in his article, were Kurdish militants straddling the
Iranian, Syrian, and Iraqi borders and now wrecking havoc against Syria's
Assad regime, and Baluchi militants based along the Iranian-Pakistani
border.
The Baluchi militants are also being
directed toward the Pakistani
government with US assistance.
In each instance, whether it is in Libya, Algeria, Syria, Iran, or Pakistan,
immense efforts have been made by these governments to destroy entirely
these organizations. In each case, the US purposely arms, trains, and
shelters these organizations, with troupes of dissent leaders populating
London, Washington, and Langley, Virginia, creating a "rouge's UN" of sorts.
Careful observers who check the backgrounds of "experts" brought onto the
duplicitous BBC, CNN, or Al Jazeera networks for interviews can see
sometimes 2-3 of these exiled extremist leaders at a time being given
airtime and dressed up as "freedom fighters."
The threat of militant
extremism is one the United States government and its allies have been
purposefully perpetuating as a pretext for expanding military and economic
power into sovereign nation-states disinterested in their Wall Street and
London centric "globalization."
War on Terror - President X's War
While many may say the "War on Terror" was Bush's war, a legacy Obama has
inherited, it is clear through Obama's "actions" that the war has continued
on in earnest, even expanded, following the same path with all but
superficial rhetoric affixed to give it a more "progressive' look.
The
current conflagration in the Middle East and North Africa was planned all
the way back in the early 90's with each president since then, rubber
stamping the steps necessary to push the plan for a "new Middle East"
forward.
It was Bush Sr. who ravaged Iraq and left US troops permanently stationed in
the Middle East. Clinton oversaw Al Qaeda's ushering in of NATO intervention
in the Kosovo conflict. Bush Jr. of course was in office when Afghanistan
and Iraq were invaded and occupied. Now, Obama is overseeing the "Arab
Spring" for which activists were trained and bankrolled by the US State
Department before he even came into office.
He is also overseeing the
destruction of Libya, and the destabilization of Syria (for more
information, see
Globalists Coming Full Circle).
As the 2012 US election nears, we are confronted with the obvious
establishment candidate of choice, Rick Perry, facing off against another 4
years of Obama's servile obedience to the corporate-financier agenda driving
American policy.
Rick Perry assures us that he will bring change, stating
that America,
"cannot afford four more years of this rudderless leadership."
However, in reality, the same US policy makers that have engineered the last
10 years of the global "War on Terror" are already lined up behind Perry to
ensure that indeed we do get,
"four more years of this rudderless
leadership."
Foreign Policy
recently reported that warmongering Neo-Conservatives
including Douglas Feith, William Luti, Andrew McCarthy, Charles Stimson, and
Daniel Fata, with the help of certified warmonger and corporate fascist
Donald Rumsfeld, had been introduced to Rick Perry to help him "brush up" on
foreign policy.
Also meeting with Perry was,
By "hawk internationalist," Foreign Policy indicates that it means,
"embracing American exceptionalism and the unique role we must play in
confronting the many threats we face."
In actual terms it means embracing
more wars, more meddling abroad, and more corporate driven agendas to expand
Wall Street and London's financial, military, and economic hegemony
worldwide.
Perry will simply take what both Bush and Obama have done, affix
the appropriate spin, rhetoric, and propaganda, and continue spilling
American blood and wasting American treasure.
Perry is merely a public
relations officer ready to take the heat for the next four years while the
real policy makers continue operating out of the sight and mind of the
American public.
The "War on Terror" is a Fraud
If Bush, Obama, and Perry are not making decisions, who is? Who are the
chief proponents of this "War on Terror," who are the architects behind the
policy and who is bankrolling them?
More importantly, how can they have
spent the last 10 years sending American kids to fight Al Qaeda and now are
overtly handing them the nation of Libya?
The Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) is
a corporate and
US State
Department-funded policy institute that claims to be dedicated to promoting,
"pluralism, defending democratic values, and fighting the ideologies that
threaten democracy."
It is decidedly "Neo-Conservative" and focuses almost
exclusively on starting and maintaining wars at America's expense.
FDD's "executive team" includes James Woolsey and Clifford May, while its
"leadership council" includes Bill Kristol - all signatories of a recent
Foreign Policy Initiative
letter addressed to House Republicans asking them
to discard the UN mandate for NATO's Libyan intervention and commit more
support specifically for regime change.
Acting Senator Joseph Lieberman also
can be found on FDD's "leadership council" and has been a chief proponent of
war with Libya, as well as Syria and Iran,
alongside John McCain.
FDD has a
myriad of publications expressing the elation of the "Neo-Conservative"
establishment over current operations against Libya and the possible
springboard the Libyan war serves toward US intervention in Syria and Iran.
FDD's only criticism of Obama is that more should be done, faster, and at a
greater expense to America.
Michael Ledeen, a "freedom scholar," expresses
this well in his article titled, "Lessons of Libya (and Syria, and, Some
Day, Iran)," where he throws in his organization's collective desire to
intervene in both Syria and Iran, for good measure.
The Atlantic article, "Al-Qaeda Is Winning," written by FDD "senior fellow"
Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, expresses the true contempt these individuals have
toward their audience.
In this piece reflecting on the last 10 years of the
"War on Terror," Gartenstein-Ross claims that Al Qaeda's ability to use
cheap means to provoke the United States into a multi-billion dollar defense
is rendering an Al Qaeda victory through a "strategy of a thousand cuts."
Of
course, the x-ray machines and other security apparatuses being installed
across the United States and the tremendous amount of money being used to
sustain combat operations around the world "hunting terrorists," doesn't go
into a black hole. Instead, it goes into the pockets of the very people
funding the work of Mr. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross and his peers throughout his
and other US and British think-tanks.
Other notorious think-tanks promoting the "War on Terror" as well as
literally engineering the latest war in Libya, and with extensive blueprints
for destabilizing and overthrowing Syria and Iran, include the Brookings
Institution mentioned above, the International Institute for Strategic
Studies (IISS), and the Atlantic Council covered in depth in "Atlantic
Council: Is Libya a "Global Con?"
All three are predictably funded,
chaired, and directed by the largest banks, oil companies, and defense
contractors on earth, as well as their representatives in the
corporate-owned media, public relations and law firms, as well as acting
corporate board members themselves.
The Brookings Institute who wrote the definitive blueprint for covert
destabilization within a foreign sovereign nation, "Which Path to Persia?"
is funded by, among many others,
-
Bank of America
-
Goldman Sachs
-
the Rothschilds
-
Citi
-
Exxon
-
Chevron
-
Shell
-
Lockheed Martin
-
Northrop Grumman
-
Boeing
-
General Electric
-
Raytheon (makers of the Tomahawk cruise missile
used extensively throughout NATO's Libya campaign)
-
Google (who has
already renamed Libya's Green Square to the contrived "Martyr's Square" on
Google Maps)
One would assume those at Brookings would carry forward with
shame and fear with such obvious conflicts of interest muddling their
"policy making," instead they are beyond arrogant, bolstered by the
ignorance and apathy of the masses. A full list of their corporate sponsors
can be found in their 2010 annual report, starting on page 19.
Likewise the IISS was instrumental in analyzing, promoting, and guiding
NATO's military intervention in Libya as well as maintaining the myth of
"global terrorism" and the necessity of continuing the "War on Terror."
They
too are representatives of some of the largest corporate-financier interests
on earth, all of whom have enriched themselves with their self-promoted,
unending war, with their
board of trustees containing current and former
representatives from,
We have seen how in nearly every case, national governments have attempted
to crush Al Qaeda, and in every case the US and UK have propped them up
again.
We see how each war is explicitly engineered and promoted by the same
corporate-financier interests capitalizing on them at everyone else's
expense.
In the 1930's United States Marine Corps General
Smedley Butler
stated, "war is a racket," and explained that a racket is best described,
"as
something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a
small "inside" group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit
of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people
make huge fortunes."
Clearly today, this "racket" has become so advanced, so elaborate, so
pervasive in politics and culture, that the label of "racket" doesn't quite
suit it.
A better term could be a, "scientific dictatorship" where teams of
highly trained propagandists, in tandem with the corporate-owned media,
including Hollywood, the music industry, publishing houses, and PR firms,
all work to manage the public's perception on a global scale. It is both
terrifying as it is perhaps overreaching.
The "War on Terror" is a fraud,
and one that is now unraveling. For every lie that is told, a vast amount of
resources must be spent to sell it and continue propping it up. No matter
how much is spent, if a mind wakes up to the fraud, it does so permanently.
However vast the fraudulent "War on Terror" is, those speaking the truth
face a downhill battle now reaching critical mass.
Libya is being handed
over to terrorists by the same exact people who told our sons and daughters
to lay down their lives to fight these very same people. No amount of
propaganda, however scientifically formulated, can obfuscate the treason
that has taken place.
The next step of course, after speaking out about the truth, is to review
the above mentioned corporate-financier interests, represented by
corporations and banks we depend on daily, driving this treasonous agenda,
and put each one out of business by
boycotting and
replacing them
systematically.
The "War on Terror" is an absolute fraud, fabricated in
whole, and it is only our apathy and inaction coupled with our unwitting
patronization of these corporate-financier interests that allows this fraud
to continue on.
