Superpower illustrates how the United States has leveraged its position to
ensure unilateral world domination through absolute,

economic superiority
-

superiority
-
government deception
Superpower is a well-executed and comprehensive film that asks tough
questions and goes behind the scenes of America's national security
apparatus and military actions.
Far from a 'conspiracy' film about the
dangers of government secrets and regime change, this well-balanced film
straddles the philosophical divide and allows viewers to understand the U.S.
quest for global dominance through economic and military strategy that is
exposed through review of historical events, personal interviews, and
analysis of U.S. foreign policy.
