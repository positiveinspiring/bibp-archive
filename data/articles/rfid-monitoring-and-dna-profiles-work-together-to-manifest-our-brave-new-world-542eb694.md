In Texas, children attending school in the
Northside Independent School District will be required to
carry RFID chipped
cards while on campus. The 6,000 students movements will be monitored by
faculty, in a pilot program that hopes to expand to tracking all students in
the 12 districts.
Principal Wendy Reyes of Jones Middle School,
explains:
Its going to give us the opportunity to
track our students in the building.
They may have been in the nurses
office, or the counselors office, or vice principals office, but they
were markedly absent from the classroom because they werent sitting in
the class. It will help us have a more accurate account of our
attendance.
Schools being the intended beta-test ground for
social conditioning, is using RFID chips to track students as cattle is
monitored on a ranch; impeding on their privacy and dignity.
RFID technology is furthered by corporations
like
Proteus Biomedical that have developed the microchip that is activated
by human stomach acids, embeds into the lining of the stomach and remotely
sends information collected through sensors about the environment.
These
transmission can be siphoned to the internet, a doctors office via computer
or any intercepting entity.
Called smart pills, the bio-tech corporations
Novartis are
creating microchipping that will assist in organ transplants and
anti-rejection drugs as well as using human clinical trials to test safety
measures. How will the pharmaceutical corporations explain away the fact
that electronic capacitors are toxic to the human body and swallowing them
on a regular basis will cause serious complications?
Continuous data broadcasting impedes on privacy
which could be used for nefarious use. Being a human reception tower to be
interceded by anyone with a WiFi connection or pharmecurticals
microchipping scanners.
Russian-based software called
Voice Grid Nation will be used by law enforcement to record and analyze
US voices. Mathematical algorithms will file massive amounts of data that
can be translated to use on surveillance operations in the domestic US.
Furthermore, the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) is endeavoring to collect the DNA of all children to be
stored in case of
a future arrest or circumstance wherein the use of their DNA would be
pertinent or necessary for involvement in criminal activity and conviction.
DHS estimates that 1 million people are
subject to this intrusive collection because of incarceration and
non-criminal reasons. Children who are caught in the criminal system have
their DNA stored along with adult offenders, according to the
Council for Responsible Genetics.
Jennifer Lynch of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) asserts:
Collecting DNA from anyone detained by the
government for any number of non-criminal reasons - especially juveniles
- seems to be yet another step on the slippery slope of collecting DNA
from everyone in the United States, no matter their status.
The US Congress passed the
Katie
Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act of 2010 that expanded the collection
of DNA in the name of protecting children and enhancing federal criminal
databases.
This works in tandem with the
DNA Initiative which provides,
funding, training and assistance to ensure
that forensic DNA reaches its full potential to solve crimes, protect
the innocent and identify missing persons.
DNA collection is
justified for the purposes of obtaining a medical history and
predisposition to disease. These samples then become part of the warrantless
collections that are mingled in with criminal profiles to create genetic
databases on all American citizens.
An estimated
10 million DNA samples stored in
CODIS, a massive DNA database, are collected on the local state and
federal levels and provided to law enforcement. This database will be
utilized for pre-crime purposes and have been sanctioned by federal courts.
After birth, infants in hospitals have their
blood taken under the guise of screening for diseases; however
collections where genetic information have been formed over the decades on
nearly every American.
Under the Rapid DNA initiative, a collection is
made easy by use of a Q-tip and the suspects saliva. The technology is
praised as being a
replacement to fingerprinting and as the future of forensic analyses.
As DNA collecting continues, the use of RFID
chipping facilitates the monitoring and movements of American citizens.
Beginning with children, the US government is working to control the most
important aspects of American society.
The generations who grow up in a
control grid will not question their enslavement.
-
They will trust law enforcement in a fear-filled
respect and hope that they will not be taken under pre-crime circumstances
into the prisons.
-
They will cower at the prospect of their DNA being used
against them.
These two in tandem will serve to keep future generations in
line and avoid massive uprisings as is seen in our current social climate.
These controls are sold as making our world safer or better, yet they go
unnoticed for what they really are.
These are the final chapters being written in
the systematic and planned-implosion of our free society.
