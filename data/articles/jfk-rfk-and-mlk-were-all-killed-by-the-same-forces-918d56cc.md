The murders of John F. Kennedy,
Robert F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King were all
orchestrated by the same group.
How can I be sure? I can be sure by a simple
preponderance of circumstantial evidence which overwhelmingly connects the
three most important and horrific assassinations in the 20th
century.
The Vietnam War
More than 58,000 soldiers
died in Vietnam as well as a few good men
who tried to make a
difference for the American people.
All three men shared a similar goal of not
becoming more deeply involved in the Vietnam War and they paid for it with
their lives.
John F. Kennedy sought to avoid the Vietnam War
because he saw it as a military quagmire that would burn American resources,
needlessly waste American lives and would ultimately hurt his legacy as a
president who oversaw an unwinnable war.
Robert Kennedy was still reeling from his older
brother's assassination for which the Vietnam War was a major factor which
motivated the co-conspirators. RFK was determined to end the war in Vietnam.
Robert also posed the threat of being able to
reopen his brother's murder and,
...had a lot to worry about if that were ever to
happen.
RFK had to be stopped with regard to his quest
for the Presidency.
As Robert Kennedy sought the Democratic
nomination for the 1968 presidential race, we should take note of the fact
that most of his supporters were in their early to mid 20′s which comprised
the demographics of people most vehemently opposed to the Vietnam War.
Therefore, Robert F. Kennedy had a motive to
withdraw the forces from Vietnam for political reasons.
At the beginning of the 1968 Democratic campaign
season, most people didn't give Robert Kennedy a snowballs chance in hell of
securing the nomination from his party. However, his early stunning upset
victories caused great alarm among the establishment elite. One of the
stories that floated among intelligence operatives who have spoken out was
that Robert Kennedy was told not to go to California and participate in the
Democratic primary.
He was clearly told to withdraw from the race or
he would be killed.
Reportedly, Robert Kennedy scoffed at the
threats clearly thinking that the establishment elite would not be able to
get away with assassinating two different Kennedy's in less than five years.
Allegedly, Martin Luther King was killed, in
part, at the height of the civil rights movement, in order to provide Robert
Kennedy with a high-profile warning that nobody was beyond the reach of the
elite establishment. Dr. King's assassination did not sway Robert Kennedy
from his political ambitions and he ultimately paid the ultimate price for
ignoring the warning.
Martin Luther King was a threat to the
establishment elite, not simply because he was having a revolutionary civil
rights movement and was succeeding, he was also opposed to the Vietnam War.
King's objection to the Vietnam War was not
based so much on geopolitical reasons, but rather on issues of racial
equality.
At a time in our country's history when we still
had a military draft, a disproportionate number of black males, particularly
in the South, were being drafted in lieu of white males. And King was also
opposed to the disproportionate number of black soldiers who were being sent
to Vietnam.
King's objections to the Vietnam War
were dangerous to the establishment.
King drew the attention of J. Edgar
Hoover and was illegally spied upon by the FBI. And if you want a reason to
dislike J. Edgar Hoover any more, Hoover removed King's
FBI bodyguards shortly before his assassination. Of course, the
establishment would have us believe that this was just another coincidence.
The Vietnam War was a huge cash cow for the
establishment elite in the areas of oil, the military-industrial complex and
the banks.
Nothing was going to interfere with
establishment's right to wage war for profit.
Single Assassins
The establishment says that John Kennedy,
Robert Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King were all killed by
lone assassins who most people labeled as mentally ill and extremist in
their beliefs.
Ask yourself an important question.
If you were
going to carry out a high-profile assassination of well-guarded individuals,
this would require a great deal of planning, don't you think?
One would have to be able to get in proximity to
their target, remain undetected, conceal their weapon until the last moment
and then flawlessly carry out the plot with an accuracy that's second to
none.
With the high degree of planning that would have
to go in to these three assassinations, why would anyone risk discovery by
revealing their plans in advance by confessing in a diary which could've
been serendipitously discovered?
Perhaps we can buy this ridiculous diary
explanation in one of these assassinations. More amazingly, each
diary left a convincing trail of condemning evidence as to the written, self
expressed guilt of the assassin which would leave no doubt in the public's
mind that the assassin acted alone.
Therefore, we are asked to believe that this
scenario happened three times, in the three major assassinations of the 20th
century, less than five years apart and we're supposed to believe that this
commonality of modus operandi is just a mere coincidence? Are you kidding
me?
Meanwhile the establishment elite gets to point
the finger individually at each of the accused three assassins by pointing
to these diaries.
John Kennedy was allegedly killed by Lee
Harvey Oswald. Oswald supposedly wrote a diary upon his return journey
from his previous defection to the Soviet Union in which he threatened the
president with harm. Many handwriting analysts discredit the Oswald diary as
a diary that was written in just a few sessions and not over a period of
months and years as the Warren Commission claimed.
Robert Kennedy was killed by Sirhan Sirhan
and the diary was later discovered and used to implicate the accused
assassin in a court of law.
Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated by
James Earl Ray and he too had a diary professing his intentions to kill
the civil rights activist. Interestingly, members of the King family visited
James Earl Ray on many occasions in prison and publicly stated that they do
not believe that James Earl Ray was the man who killed Dr. Martin Luther
King.
This trifecta trail of implication through the
finding of a diary is not believable and this really does demonstrate how
dumb the establishment elite thinks the American people truly are that we
would believe the same story three times over.
The Lone Assassin Myth
Political assassinations of this magnitude are
complicated to say the least.
How one sniper, or one gunman could have carried
out this act, without any assistance, is very difficult to believe. Failure
to use a spotter in all three cases and the failure to have an accomplice in
all three cases is just not believable.
And that is exactly what the House Select
Committee on Assassinations in 1977 stated when Congress issued an opinion
which stated that JFK was murdered by at least two gunmen.
Yet the media propaganda spin still continues to
this day.
All Three Assassins Were
Mentally Ill
All three of the assassins have been categorized
to the public as extremists who are mentally ill.
There is actually a fourth assassination attempt
in the 20th century in which the establishment claims was carried out by a
mentally ill lone assassin and that person was the would-be assassin of
Ronald Reagan, John Hinckley.
Wouldn't you say that the establishment went to
the well a little too often with this profile?
Conclusion
Let's sum up the "official" position of the
establishment.
The three most prominent assassinations of the
20th century were carried out against high-profile political targets. And
according to the establishment elite, all of the assassinations were the
individual acts of one man with an unstable mental health background and
extremist political views.
Further, all the assassins possessed a diary
which professes their murderous intentions towards their individual target,
and just coincidentally, the diary was discovered and used to implicate the
single assassin notion in each case.
And let's not forget that in two of the
three assassinations involving John Kennedy and Martin Luther King, expert
marksmanship was displayed.
In fact, in the case of Oswald, nobody has been
able to duplicate the accuracy and speed of which the assassination had to
be carried out in 5.6 seconds. Don't you wish that MIT would run the odds on
these probabilities being due to chance.
Fifty years later following the death of John
Kennedy and 45 years after the death of Robert Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther
King, some of the older folks in this country still seek answers.
-
Why in 2013 is assassination evidence still
being held under lock and key and the American people are not allowed to
look at it?
-
What is the establishment afraid that we might learn?
-
And more
disturbingly, why don't more Americans care?
For when we let a few men, behind-the-scenes,
commit a coup d'état against three high level political figures, especially
the President of the United States, and subsequently change policy in case
of John Kennedy, we no longer live in a democratic republic. We now live in a corporate oligarchy.
When these events are allowed to go on and the
true perpetrators remain unpunished and the evidence is carefully concealed
decades after the events, then what we are left with is a Praetorian Guard
who runs the government for behind-the-scenes committing assassinations,
rigging elections and by bribing politicians with undue corporate influence
and gratuity.
Add in
the control of the media and we live in a
prison
country.
This is why you should care and this is why it's
disgraceful that more of the alternative media is not covering these
events and more Americans don't give a damn about what happened to these
three men and why they were assassinated.
The same forces were killed by the elite
establishment using the same modus operandi, representing the identical
interlocking directorates of the entities that are wreaking havoc in tyranny
upon our country today (e.g. the Federal Reserve, the military industrial
complex etc.).
There are definitive reasons, with modern day
implications which describe why you should care and this is why you should
take the time to investigate and educate your neighbors because the
assassins of these three men, all from the same groups, are responsible for
the mess we're in today.
And we can't fix the mess we're in today unless
we understand how we got into the situation we are mired in.
JFK, RFK
and MLK were clearly killed by
the same forces.
If you are
wondering about the identities of these forces, I refer you to Part
One (JFK
Murder - Fifty Years Later and the Cover Up Continues)
of this series where the identities of these interlocking
directorates are clearly identified.
There is another compelling reason why we should
keep the heat on with regard to the murders of these three men.
If we can ever have a bold American leader
attempt to lead the country out of tyranny, the amount of attention that we
pay to these three assassinations, could ultimately save the life of a
future great reformer.
I know, and many others know who pulled the
trigger from the grassy knoll in order to kill John Kennedy.
Many of us also know the identities of the
puppeteers behind the scenes
who orchestrated these heinous acts. However, nobody is home and nobody is
listening any longer as we continue to lose our country, our traditions, our
true historical past and most of all, our children's futures.
Why do we kill those who try and make a
difference? Dion wondered the same as he wrote a song about the great civil
rights reformers in American History. Before you dismiss this topic of one
that should go back on the history shelf, not to be debated again, listen to
the following song.
And then ponder, just for a moment, about how
life would be different for all of us if these men were able to carry out
the fulfillment of their dreams.
JFK Murder
-
Fifty Years Later and the Cover Up Continues

by Dave Hodges
November 16, 2013
from
TheCommonSenseShow Website
The day that John Kennedy was murdered, was the
day that Americans lost their country. Since that fateful day in November of
1963, our slide into tyranny has accelerated.
Nearly every form of tyranny which has overrun
our country has its roots in the post-JFK assassination event. JFK was
seemingly the last watchman on the wall against the encroaching tyranny of
the newly created national surveillance security police state grid.
There have only been two prominent politicians
who have stood up to the tyranny of
the New World Order since the death of
JFK.
These two men would be Reagan (until he was shot by Hinckley) and
Ron
Paul.
The Missed Opportunity Connected
to the 50th Anniversary
Last summer, I predicted that the upcoming 50th
anniversary of JFK's murder would awaken a whole new generation as to the
tyranny that the country has fallen under and who is responsible for that
tyranny.
I wrongly believed that the co-conspirators, the
interlocking pieces of the JFK assassination cabal, namely,
...would be exposed with all the
attention that the 50th anniversary would provide.
I wrongly believed that these groups with their
current and undue influence on America would also be readily identified for
what they did to JFK and to the country on November 22, 1963.
I further believed that today's younger
generation would easily build the bridge linking the corruption and undue
influence of these 1963 groups to today's political landscape and this would
be an easy association.
Unfortunately, my predictions were in error
because we in the alternative media dropped the ball.
The 2013 Establishment
Propaganda Machine Is Rolled Out
The day that JFK was murdered
was the day that Rockefeller
won the world's biggest lottery.
With the marking of the 50th anniversary of the
assassination of John F. Kennedy, there have been over 2,000 books written
on the subject and countless radio and television shows devoted to the
topic.
This fall, the globalist news corporations have
produced a rash of new JFK "investigations" which all purport to show
different ways to prove that Oswald, and Oswald alone, killed John Kennedy.
The new productions (e.g. National Geographic)
are so bad and so faulty, that they are laughable.
Media Propagandists Ignore the
Government's Final Conclusion of a Conspiracy
The modern day propagandists are winning the day
with regard to the control of the narrative surrounding the assassination.
During the height of America's skepticism
regarding
the 1964 Warren Report which stated that Lee Oswald killed John
Kennedy and that he acted alone, most Americans rejected the "official
explanation. What the modern day public, as well as the establishment
propagandists, seem to have forgotten is that in 1977, the House Select
Committee on Assassinations concluded that Oswald had help and JFK was
killed as a result of a conspiracy.
This was the final word on the subject from our
government on the assassination.
However, the history revisionists do not
want a hint of a conspiracy because this could give birth to a modern day
JFK assassination renaissance in a search for the co-conspirators who killed
JFK. Once that search would begin, the descendants of the perpetrators
organizations would not be able to escape public scrutiny.
We in the alternative and truthful media missed
a golden opportunity to wake up the country on this 50th Anniversary of
JFK's death.
This fall, if we had devoted a significant
amount of time and effort to covering the assassination, and we had been
relentless in our efforts, the under 40 crowd would understand who their
present enemies are and they would have been awakened to the present day
tyranny.
We allowed our voices to be drowned out by the mainstream fictional
media with their new JFK cover up pieces.
Sadly, we lost a golden opportunity to wake up
millions of young Americans.
At the height of JFK conspiracy fervor in the
1970′s-1990′s, according to the Gallup Poll, as many as 80% of Americans
believed that there was a conspiracy to kill JFK. Today, that number has
slipped to 61% thanks in large part to the new propaganda productions which
are influencing our younger Americans.
In the 1990′s, Oliver Stone produced
'JFK' and
Bill Kurtis and Nigel Turner produced separate investigations into the
assassination (i.e. The Men Who Killed Kennedy).
In the 1990′s, the country was spellbound by the
new revelations which were also bolstered by JFK admirer, Bill Clinton, as
he forced the release of millions of classified JFK documents.
However, the evil empire struck back around the
year, 2000, and today, you see almost nothing on TV which does not show that
Oswald was acting alone.
Follow the Money
What is conspicuously missing in most, if not
all of the accounts related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, is the
fact that normal homicidal investigative strategies have not been employed
by people in the government who would have the power to do so.
One of the
hallmark phrases in murder investigations is to "follow the money".
Every year at this time, I become reflective as
I wonder what America, and the rest of the world might have looked like if
JFK had survived, been re-elected and served a second term as President.
This year I decided to follow the money and put my thoughts on paper.
So,
let's briefly follow the money.
Vietnam
Everybody knows that the Pentagon was frothing at the
mouth to get into an armed conflict in Vietnam and/or Laos.
In 1961, JFK resisted the military pressure to place troops in Laos, as he
clearly instructed diplomat, Averell Harriman, to get the Laos issue settled
because JFK was determined to not put combat units on the ground in
Southeast Asia.
It is true that JFK was manipulated by his military advisers to place troops
on the ground in Vietnam but solely in the role as "combat advisers". JFKs
anti-Vietnam war stance frequently gets overlooked because of this.
However, in October 1963, a mere month before his death, JFK signed National
Security Action Memorandum 263 which called for the withdrawal of 1,000
troops from Vietnam by the end of 1963 and a total withdrawal of all of the
combat advisers by the end of 1965. This was one nail in the coffin of JFK.
JFK gave many speeches in which he clearly stated he was opposed to widening
U.S. military involvement in the war.
South Vietnamese leader, Diem and his brother Nhu were opposed to U.S.
attempts to control his regime and Diem and his brother were adamantly
opposed U.S. full-scale U.S. military involvement beyond the 16,000 combat
advisers stationed in the country.
On November 1, 1963, Diem and Nhu were murdered by the CIA against JFKs
wishes.
Three weeks later, to the day, John F. Kennedy was murdered. Within nine
months following the assassination, the LBJ administration launched the now
discredited false flag event, the Gulf of Tonkin attack, and 100,000 combat
troops were subsequently sent to Vietnam.
Many researchers have proven the involvement of the same CIA and its Mafia
connections which dates back to 1942 when the CIA was known as the OSS.
Knowing that the CIA and Mafia were involved in JFKs murder, does not tell
you who ordered the assassination. Any guesses on who profited the most from
the Vietnam War?
In radio parlance, you will have to stay tuned, the answer will be revealed
at the end.
There were huge financial incentives for the American defense industry to
participate in the murder of JFK.
Yes, that would be the military industrial complex which Ike warned us about
in his 1960 farewell address. In 1963, Chrysler corporation and its
subsidiaries received the lions share of defense contracts for the war,
most of which were resold to smaller corporations.
Corporations such as Bell Helicopter enjoyed unparalleled growth during the
height of the war. There are some interesting and notable parties which
controlled the Chrysler defense industry interests in 1963.
Very powerful parties would have stood to have lost a lot of money had the
war not materialized into a full-scale air and ground war.
Who am I speaking about?
All will be revealed when I connect the dots at the end. Oh by the way, the
forerunner to the bid rigging and recipient of no bid contracts in Iraq, KBR,
was also found guilty of the same thing in Vietnam when they were given the
responsibility for building South Vietnams military infrastructure.
The more things change, the more they do stay the same.
The Bay of Pigs
Making Enemies with the CIA -
The Bay of Pigs
It was very well known that JFK refused to
support and sanction the CIA backed Cuban refugee invasion of Cuba by
refusing to allow air cover.
The invasion failed and the careers of CIA
Director, Dulles, and CIA Assistant Director, Cabal, were over. The
proverbial line in the sand had been drawn and the CIA and JFK became mortal
enemies with JFK threatening to break up the agency into a "thousand
pieces".
Add to this fact, is the fact that it is
well-known that the darker parts of the CIA act as mercenaries for certain
groups who are not on the government payroll. Today, we would call these
shadowy forces, the New World Order.
It is clear that with the advent of
the Bay of
Pigs, the brain trust for the assassination had been born and they would
double down as this agency would perpetrate the cover-up, such as losing the
President's brain during the autopsy to hide the fact that JFK's fatal head
shot came from an exploding bullet, which means that Oswald's defective
Italian rifle could not have been used in the commission of the crime.
Maybe this is also why LBJ had the Presidential
limousine "cleaned up" immediately following the crime and the vehicle was
never subsequently examined as any other crime scene would have been.
LBJ
should have gone to prison for obstruction of justice, but I digress.
Jim Marrs and other researchers have
clearly implicated the CIA as the masterminds of the assassination. I agree
with Marrs, however, the CIA were not the original planners, they merely
were tasked with carrying out the assassination.
Regardless, the rich and famous wanted Cuba back
and JFK had destroyed their plans for continued domination of the Island
state.
Ten days following the Bay of Pigs, JFK gave his
famous "secret society" speech. He is the first, and the only President to
ever identify
the globalists as the enemy of America and humanity as a
whole.
If you have never listened to the speech, you
should take the time to listen now, for if you do, the events of today will
make a great deal more sense:
The speech that got JFK killed
The Cuban Missile Crisis
Havana had become a play place for the rich and
famous prior to the Castro led revolution.
Upon seizing power, Castro promptly nationalized
all gaming resorts and the Mafia lost their insanely high profits and the
rich and famous lost their financial cut, as well as their 1960 version of
Bohemian Grove. In the eyes of the rich and powerful, JFK had one more
opportunity to get control over Cuba with the opportunity presented by the
Cuban Missile Crisis.
In 1962, in response to America's placing
offensive nuclear weapons in Turkey, close to the Soviet border, the
Russians did the same in Cuba. This event brought the U.S. and the Soviet
Union to the brink of nuclear war.
All of JFK's military advisers wanted to invade
Cuba with ground troops. JFK opted for the ever-contracting naval blockade.
Although history has proven that our invading
troops would have been nuked, and that JFK pursued the correct course of
action, the powerful military was now lining up against JFK. And, again, the
rich and famous were thwarted in their desire to reassert control over Cuba
and the defense contractors smelled the end of the gravy train.
Then in June of 1963, JFK gave an incredible
speech at American University in which he called for the total destruction
of nuclear weapons.
This would have resulted in the end of the
financially lucrative Cold War and the "Pax Americana enforced on the world
by American weapons of war", and a movement toward "general and complete
disarmament" would have begun.
A few months later JFK signed a Limited Test
Ban Treaty with Nikita Khrushchev.
What would happen to the profits of Raytheon and
Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) if there was no cold war?
The executives at the defense plants could relax
because when JFK was killed, LBJ ordered the single largest increase in U.S.
history and before the ink was even dry on JFK's death certificate.
America Cannot Have Peace - It
Is Bad For Business
Please take the time and listen to JFK's,
American University Speech, June 10, 1963, and if you understand what it
means to be an American, it will bring tears to your eyes and I believe that
this speech also brought a bullet to JFK's brain, because he was poking a
stick into the eyes of the military industrial complex.
JFK's "Peace" Speech at American University
The Federal Reserve
On June 4, 1963, President Kennedy issued
Executive Order 11110 and this accompanied the Kennedy act which was the
beginning of an attempt to strip
the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to
loan money, at interest, to the government.
JFK was on his way of stripping the then 50 year
history of fleecing the American people.
In effect, JFK, by issuing 4.3
billion dollars of U.S. notes based upon silver held in reserve, JFK was
going to be able to wipe away the beginnings of national debt which, today,
has mortally wounded the American economy.
Please take note of the fact that this event was
only a little over 5 months before the assassination. When JFK was murdered, LBJ failed to continue with the program.
Who stood to lose the most money if the Federal
Reserve had lost its stranglehold on the American economy?
You would be right if you answered
Chase-Manhattan Bank with its 6,389,445 shares of Federal Reserve Board
Stock valued at 32.3% of the total value of stock at the Fed. Also, Citibank
had a lot to lose by this move as well as they were invested in the Federal
Reserve shares to the tune of 4,051,851, or 20.5% of the total value.
I think you might be getting an idea who owned
and/or controlled the majority interests in these two banks in 1963, but
there is more before we answer the question on who profited the most from
the murder of a sitting President in 1963.
The Oil Depletion Allowance
By the end of 1962, the robber barons which ran
the oil industry estimated, that their earnings on foreign investment
capital would fall to 15 percent, compared with 30 percent in 1955 if the
oil depletion allowance was diminished in accordance with JFK's proposal.
JFK's attack upon the oil depletion allowance,
which permitted oil producers to deduct up to 27.5% of their income as tax
exempt provided the robber barons of oil a lower tax rate and a competitive
business advantage, not shared by any other business interests.
JFK targeted the oil depletion allowance and it
was estimated the government might retain more than $300 million in tax
revenue each year if the depletion allowance was reduced.
Although the oil depletion allowance remained
intact, due to the congressmen who were recipients of oil company campaign
contributions, JFK made some very powerful enemies in the oil industry.
It was the oil depletion allowance which made
drilling for oil a no risk venture.
An oil speculator could drill five wells
and if four were dry wells and only the fifth struck oil, the speculator
would still make money because of tax breaks resulting from the depletion
allowance deducted from owed taxes.
President Kennedy pointed out the obvious when
he stated,
"
no one industry should be permitted to
obtain an undue tax advantage over all others."
JFK had made an enemy out of the oil industry
and its biggest tycoon, David Rockefeller with the proposal to reduce the
oil depletion allowance.
-
Do you know the two banks which
controlled 53% of the Federal Reserve in 1963? Rockefeller owned the
controlling interest in both banks.
-
How about Chrysler, KBR, Bell Helicopter
and the Vietnam War? You are way ahead if you said, David
Rockefeller.
-
And what about the nuclear arms race, to
which the cessation of the cold war, would have meant the loss of
profits to the defense industry? And who controls the defense
industry? David Rockefeller.
We had to have a cold war, then, for the same
reasons we need a war on terror today. It is good for business and with the
subsequent growth of government power which comes with war, the erosion of
Constitutional liberties increases.
All roads for the motivations of the JFK
assassination leads to David Rockefeller as being the first mover in the
plot.
Do I have the smoking gun that I can place in
Rockefeller's hand? The short answer is no.
However, it is safe to say that
the day that John Kennedy died, there were no tears shed at the Rockefeller
estate.
If JFK's murder had been anything but the
killing of the President, any police detective worth his salt, would have
followed the money trail and arrests would have been made based on the known
facts.
It is unacceptable that as we race toward the
50th Anniversary of the event, this next week, that not one person has been
brought to justice in a court of law for the assassination of John Kennedy.
Instead, a patsy, Lee Oswald, who never fired a gun on November 22, 1963,
was framed and used as the patsy.
And before Oswald could talk, he was murdered
two days later under very mysterious circumstances. Over the next several
days, I am going to publish mini-excerpts on facts about the JFK
assassination which are not being covered by the MSM.
My first entry will focus on how we know that
Oswald did not kill JFK.
Reflections on What Could Have
Been
If JFK would have lived, we would
have not lost 58,000 lives in Vietnam.
Millions of Vietnamese would have
been spared. We would have an economy that is backed by silver and we would
virtually have no debt because the corrupt Federal Reserve would have faded
into oblivion as it did during the Andrew Jackson Administration.
America would have schools that
would the envy of the world, not the butt of jokes, because we would not
spending money to kill people, but rather to educate, improve health care
and we could have even afforded to pay off all privately held mortgages if
we had only remembered the words of JFK when he reminded the faculty and
staff at American University on June 10, 1963, that,
"We all breathe the same
air
"
We would live in a far better
place had we lived out JFK's expressed ideals.
I write this piece, not just to
remind America of what we lost and how America suffered with Jack Kennedy's
death, I write this piece for those who know little of nothing of what
happened on November 22, 1963, mostly young people, in order that they can
know that the tyranny being imposed upon us, need not exist.
There is a better way and for a
moment when I listen to his speeches, I can imagine a better world.

EDITOR'S NOTE:
Outstanding post...!
