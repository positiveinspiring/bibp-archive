It is a year since the US government pulled off one of the most audacious
stunts of the 21st century, when on May 2nd 2011 they claimed to have killed
Osama bin Laden during a Navy SEAL operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
The contemptuously sloppy story spun by the US
government, parroted without question by the controlled corporate media, and
obligingly swallowed by a largely gullible Western public, was dubious in
the extreme.
Many credible commentators, including respected intelligence analysts and
heads of state, had claimed years before 2011 that bin Laden was dead.
It is widely believed that bin Laden suffered
from kidney disease; former President of Pakistan General Pervez Musharraf
stated in January 2002 that he thought the Al Qaeda leader had died of the
disease, and after reviewing video footage of a poorly-looking bin Laden
from late 2001, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta observed that his,
"frosting of the appearance is something
that people a lot of times associate with chronic kidney failure, renal
failure, certainly someone who is requiring dialysis would have that."
Even if bin Laden was still alive in May 2011,
events following his supposed killing proved, for the rationally critical,
very difficult to swallow.
Were we really expected to accept without
question bin Laden's corpse being hastily buried in the North Arabian sea,
within 24 hours of his killing? US authorities made the absurd claim that in
doing so they were following Islamic tradition, which dictates that a body
should be buried within 24 hours of death.
Whilst this is true, Islamic tradition
definitely does not require burial at sea, other than in exceptional
circumstances such as when a person dies during a sea voyage - when all
effort must still be made to perform a burial in the ground.
Skeptics also
rightly point to historic examples of the US failing to respect Islamic
tradition - when, for example, Saddam Hussein's sons Uday and Qusay were
killed, and their bodies kept for 11 days before being released for burial.
It is difficult not to react with incredulity to
the manner in which bin Laden's corpse was supposedly disposed; the ultimate
proof of his death, prime evidence which would clearly be demanded by many,
simply dumped in the sea.
The public were of course prevented from seeing other evidence of bin
Laden's death.
Video footage of the raid and photographs of bin Laden's
corpse, the government declared, were simply too gruesome to publish. The
CIA, who claim to have 52 separate photos and videos of the raid and burial,
has fought hard to keep their purported evidence secret.
A Freedom Of Information Request for the photos
prompted John Bennett, director of the National Clandestine Service of the
CIA, to claim that releasing the images would pose a grave risk to national
security. Last week a federal judge agreed.
U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said
the CIA's,
"explanation of the threat to our national
security that the release of these records could cause passes muster",
and that "verbal descriptions of the death and burial of Osama bin Laden
will have to suffice, for this court will not order the release of
anything more."
We were initially led to believe that Obama and
other members of his administration personally watched bin Laden's killing.
White House "situation room" photos featured an
apparently shocked Hillary Clinton seemingly watching events live - even
though it was subsequently admitted by CIA director Leon Panetta that there
had been no live feed during the raid.
Several other significant revisions
were made to the original account of the raid, in the days following May
2nd.
It was initially claimed, though subsequently
retracted, that bin Laden's henchmen had engaged Navy SEALs in a fierce
gunfight, and that Osama himself had been armed.
The propagandistic claim that bin Laden cowered
behind his wife when cornered by US special forces also turned out to be
false. Some asked why, if he did not pose a physical threat to the SEALs,
bin Laden had not been taken alive? It would surely have made sense to
capture the world's most wanted man, the supposed leader of a global terror
network and an invaluable source of intelligence, alive.
The accounts of locals in Abbottabad also contradicted the official
narrative. Whilst US authorities admitted they lost a helicopter during the
raid, they said no US military personnel had been injured or killed.
Eyewitness Mohammed Bashir, however, lived opposite the compound and claimed
to have seen many dead bodies in the crashed helicopter.
And whilst officials say none of the SEAL Team 6
members involved in the compound raid were amongst the unit's 22 soldiers
killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan in August 2011, some have
speculated that the incident was part of a cover-up connected to the raid in
May. There are other intriguing local testimonies.
A BBC journalist who spoke to 50 Abbottabad
residents could only find one who believed bin Laden had been living at the
compound.
One local was adamant that the elderly figure
purported to be bin Laden, who appears in a video apparently recovered from
the compound, is actually his neighbor - a man he knows "very well" and
whose name is "Akbar Khan".
It is also odd that the fugitive bin Laden would
choose to hide in, of all places, Abbottabad - being as it is a military
town home to the Kabul military academy. The cover-up appears to have
continued this year, when in February "bin Laden's compound" was totally
demolished.
On February 27th we reported that,
"Pakistani authorities began tearing down
the house on Saturday night, working under floodlights, with the local
population subject to a strict curfew and Pakistan Army soldiers and
police personnel reportedly deployed in large numbers", and how the
"total destruction of the death scene makes it much less likely
independent verification of the official narrative will ever be
established".
As the mainstream seems determined to ignore,
downplay, or ridicule attempts to verify the official narrative, it is
clearly down to us - the alternative, independent media - to try and do so.
