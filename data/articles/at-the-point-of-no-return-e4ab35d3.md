The
wrong people are in charge... that's pretty
obvious.
But, what is not so obvious is,
A very strange phenomenon...
This World is run by those of whom the great majority have absolutely
no qualifications to be at the helm of anything not even a small
rowing boat.
Yet, somehow or other, there they are perched in
their palaces, surveying their empires - while simultaneously engaging in
the systematic degradation of planet Earth.
Doesn't matter whether they are,
...or just about any big bosses they have the
distinction of all acting in unison.
While by contrast, the great majority of
intelligent and able bodied citizens of this planet, only manage to act or
react - in sporadic and discordant bursts; if at all.
The current controlling masters and it hasn't changed much over
many centuries - have a commonality of intent:
to extract the last ounces of profit and
prestige from any and all assets and opportunities that fall into their
grasp.
Yet even that isn't enough for some of them.
Profits get a bit boring when they come in the
tens of millions year after year and one has occupied the prime suite at
Claridges for the past six months. No, there always needs to be just one
more thing that can be 'owned' and brought under control, so as to satisfy
the false aggrandizement that is part and parcel of an endless and
ultimately fruitless attempt to become omnipotent and untouchable by
ordinary mortals.
Such is the aphrodisiac called 'power'.
Time and again, those who suffer most from a sense of being inwardly
dispossessed are the very ones to seek, as compensation, the maximum level
of outer possessiveness. And this is the mechanism whereby the wrong people
get to be in charge.
Ironically, many who do not suffer such delusional power urges, are quite
happy to just tick along fulfilling their aspirations and daily needs as
best they can. Yet in doing so, they unwittingly allow the megalomaniacs
a direct route to the seats of power.
Those who are secure enough in themselves to take a responsible attitude
towards the life around them, seldom come forward to take-on positions of
authority and civil responsibility. Their preference is to leave it to
others and in too many cases these 'others' often harbor barely disguised
ulterior motives.
Yet we look on, aghast, as our world is torn apart by dueling crooks and
madmen, each more desperate than the other for the top job in the race for
planetary ecocide. Each more desperate than the other to fill any power
vacuum that might emerge. Each more desperate than the other to hold
a cosh (a type of
blunt weapon) over the disinterested
daily workers who struggle on, trying not to notice how bad it's got.
Where do you belong in this mad scrum?
The wrong people are in charge and the right people don't want to bother
themselves unduly to do anything about it. That just about sums-up the
dire state of our post industrial 'civilization'.
Something has to give...
The question is what?
Will a critical mass of the 99% finally finally act to bring back some
genuine self autonomy through wresting control from the 1%?
Or will the 1% finally complete
their annihilation job, trashing our planetary assets and
crushing our human propensities once and of all?
That is the question...
But none of us are free to sit back and play at
second guessing the outcome. We are all in there. We are part of the pack.
Our every move, whether we see it or not, is
either promoting or resisting
the despot's master plan. There is no such thing as being 'in
between' in this game. The fence you once sat on is broken. The wires are
hanging limp. There is no no-man's-land left to hide in.
At some point soon, those who are fit to lead must take over from those who
unfit. It may be a bloodless coup or it may be a bloody insurrection. One
way or another, the shift has to happen.
Forget about Divine intervention. There will be no Divine
intervention unless and until there is a very visible human
determination already out of the starting blocks and heading for the
finishing line.
Only then is it possible that higher energies
will join the race to bring justice back to this battered World.
We are approaching the point of no return.
If we don't respond to the myriad calls for help
that are echoing around this World at an ever increased velocity each day,
then we will be condemning ourselves and those who call upon us to being
forever stranded upon a desolate and barren shore.
That help starts with helping each other to break free from our learned and
self induced state of fear and pacifism. A combination that pretty much
guarantees an unwillingness to act. An unwillingness to act even when
presented with the choice of participating in a mass genocide or opposing
it.
I use the word 'pacifism' here to convey a 'state of withdrawal' in face of
the need to act. I do not refer to the choice, which everybody has, to
refrain from violence. These are two very different conditions.
In this context, taking the decision not to act
with violence - is an action. Taking no decision, but simply retreating into
a shell - is not.
This unwillingness to act is giving voice to the notion that 'no action' is
the spiritual choice of the knowing. That to retire into a cul-de-sac of
meditation and inward looking self examination can 'change the world' by
dint of a shifted value focus. Can serve to hermetically seal the self away
from the trials and tribulations of the outer world and thereby help avoid
any confrontation with that which demands a full and spontaneous response.
Confrontation, in this view, is a negative, reactionary manifestation that
undermines 'peace' and the supposed tranquility of a chimeric world which
takes over from rational observations and becomes the new reality. A
'virtual reality'.
This is a deeply flawed and dangerous ethos. For it splits in half that
which is whole and sets the two halves in opposition to each other.
We are 'of nature' not above or outside it. We go forth and we return. That
is the Tao. Universal forces all dance to this tune. Breath, ocean waves,
cycles of birth and death, growth and decay, all is in motion and at rest,
all the time. There is no contradiction.
Outward action and inward contemplation are two halves of one whole. They
are synonymous.
One should move between the two constantly and
joyously.
When injustice become law, resistance
becomes duty.
Well, injustice has become law - yet resistance
remains doggedly muted and the search for an escape route remains the
preferred option.
Cultivate spirit, wisdom and deep awareness yes. Yet not as an alternative
to toppling our oppressors from their corporate thrones, but as part of it.
Don't be fooled. There is a war on. We are all called to the front.
Just as the white corpuscles of our bodies are fighting off attempts by the
pathogens to take hold all the time. We should be doing the same all
the time.
Everyday we should be conjuring-up and putting into affect actions to end
the
draconian government/corporate dictatorship that continues to
herd great swathes of humanity ever faster towards a sheer and genocidal
cliff.
We can have no 'peace' until the criminals at the master control consulate
are ejected from their padded leather chairs and are forced to confront the
true price of their obscene power games.
Peace - and enlightenment, at the individual level - is only possible if we
are engaged in this battle. The battle to rid both ourselves and this planet
of that which seeks to dominate and destroy the true well-spring of life.
The road to victory also requires the wise and aware to form a council of
responsible oversight to step-in to the void once the despots are
dethroned. That is an essential ingredient
of any uprising determined to manifest
genuine justice.
The lessons of history teach that fickle rebellion simply replaces one
bunch of power predators with another. That is no longer an option; we
are now at the point of no return.
This time we have to get it right.
Footnote
Some may see this as being at odds with my essay
Reverse
Engineering the Illuminati Mind Set. I don't believe it is.
The action I speak of here does not eclipse the
need to draw deeply upon compassion. However, to exercise compassion one
needs to be in a position of strength, not slavery.
