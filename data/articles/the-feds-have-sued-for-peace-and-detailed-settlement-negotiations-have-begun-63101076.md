In a very major development,
the
Federal Reserve Board faction that is in de-facto control of
the
Obama regime and Israel has approached the White Dragon
Society to negotiate a way to unfreeze their funds.
They have promised to use any released funds for
humanitarian projects and to develop hitherto
forbidden technology.
The 130-nation group that
announced a new financial system through
the
Conscious Media Network on January 1st also
contacted the White Dragon Society and said they will prove with action, and
not words, that they represent extremely powerful interests. This writer
initially, and apparently incorrectly, denounced the announcement as a psy-ops
because this group was not identical to the 117 nation Monaco group
previously reported about in this newsletter.
All of these major factions will now have to reach an agreement. There will
some serious horse-trading over the coming weeks before any sort of
agreement is reached or public announcement is made but it appears a
solution to the financial crisis is now on the horizon.
[The] group behind the current
Washington D.C. regime came to negotiate
with the
White Dragon Society after a serious bout
of recent midnight shoot-outs and daytime arrests crippled their control
network in Japan.
The D.C. representative admitted,
We used to pick the Japanese Prime
Ministers, we would tell them: this is who it is going to be, and that
was it but now we have lost control.
In essence the corporate Washington D.C.
government is now going to have to negotiate a chapter 11 restructuring of
their debt to Japan.
They have offered to pay off 90% of the debt
with gold stashed in the Philippines and the rest in cash. There is a
problem, of course, over who has the rights to the gold there as at least
three claimants have emerged.
In any case, most of the U.S. debt will have to be written off because the
fact of the matter is the U.S. cannot afford to pay it. The U.S. will need
to make some changes, though, before that is agreed to.
The real problem is that the U.S. nation has had a structural trade deficit
with the rest of the world for the past 30-years.
This problem can be solved in two ways.
-
One is to keep using the U.S. dollar and
wait until U.S. living standards fall to third world levels before
the U.S. is competitive again.
-
The other is to realize that 90% of the
dollars ever created are now outside of the U.S. and the interests
of those dollar holders are not the same as those of the United
States.
That means the U.S. needs to issue Treasury
dollars of their own and devalue them relative to the international U.S.
dollar. That will mean the Chinese stuff in Wal-Mart will suddenly become
more expensive but it will also mean the U.S. economy will be competitive
once again.
The other problem is that the U.S. military industrial complex has to
transform itself into a productive and life-enhancing entity instead of
being a parasitical and life-destroying entity.
The initial discussions between the FEDs and the White Dragon representative
revealed no major disagreement over these fundamental issues. The next step
is to open formal negotiations with the once-again independent Japanese
government. This should start next week.
The other big problem now to be discussed is what to do about the huge gap
between the off-ledger or shadow banking system and the on the
books banking system. Essentially the off-ledger stuff has got way
more zeros than the on the books stuff and some very greedy and powerful
people are going to have to be forced to agree to erase a lot of zeros from
their bank accounts.
There is simply not enough reality to justify
all those numbers. The result has been the off-ledger books have been frozen
out of the on-ledger system.
This is where the factions have been secretly fighting each other using
midnight-shoot outs, rival code books, promised astronomical bribes, spies
and computer hackers.
So far, the real world of on the books banking
has prevailed over the virtual world of huge numbers hidden in grey
screens, and black screens.
Some secret government files signed by
Queen Elizabeth
on behalf of the
Committee of 300 have also been sent to
this writer and confirmed by
BIS linked sources as genuine:
Origin
Note the astronomical numbers and the mention of
a Chinese Red Dragon.
The person who sent these files is connected to
former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. Marcos was one of the
many prominent victims of the owners of
the
FED.
What is becoming increasingly apparent after talking to many different
secret agents, secret societies and other groups is that ultimately
the
financial system is the link between group psychology and the real world.
The gold, for example, exists in the real
world but it is human psychology that determines who owns it.
What is happening now is that the small secret
group than controlled finance, is not secret any more.
