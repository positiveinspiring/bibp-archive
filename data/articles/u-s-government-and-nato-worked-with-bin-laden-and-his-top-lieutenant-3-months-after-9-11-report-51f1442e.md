FBI Translator
Alleges that
Bin Laden and His
Number 2
Former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds has
been deemed credible by
the Department of Justices Inspector General,
several senators and
a
coalition of prominent conservative and liberal groups.
The ACLU described Edmonds as:
The most gagged person in the history of the
United States of America.
And famed Pentagon Papers whistleblower
Daniel Ellsberg
says
that Edmonds possesses information far more explosive than the Pentagon
Papers.
Edmonds translated terror-related communications
for the FBI right after 9/11. In that capacity, she read communications
between terrorists and other radicals.
Edmonds said last week that Bin Laden - and his
number 2 Al Qaeda lieutenant - Ayman al-Zawahiri - worked with the
U.S. government for 3 months after 9/11 to coordinate
destabilization in the Caucus region:
By way of background, the former Italian Prime
Minister, an Italian judge, and the
former head of Italian counterintelligence
admit that NATO, with the help of the
Pentagon and CIA, carried out terror bombings in Italy and other European
countries in the 1950s and blamed the communists, in order to rally peoples
support for their governments in Europe in their fight against communism.
As one participant in this formerly-secret
program
stated:
You had to attack civilians, people,
women, children, innocent people, unknown people far removed from any
political game. The reason was quite simple.
They were supposed to force these people,
the Italian public, to turn to the state to ask for greater security
(and see
this) (Italy and other European countries subject to the terror
campaign had joined NATO before the bombings occurred).
This was codenamed Operation Gladio.
And watch
this BBC special. And
see this for background.
Edmonds says that some portions of Operation
Gladio are continuing to this day, and that Ayman al-Zawahiri and Bin Laden
worked for NATO and the Pentagon as part of Operation Gladio:
Edmonds told us:
For the past 11 years I have been
emphasizing that my State Secrets Privilege & Gag Orders had to do with
the FBI files (covering period 1996-2002 February) on
covert-terrorist operations in Caucasus
and Central Asia backed,
managed and armed by US actors.
These
US-NATO directed operations in the region involved Bin-Laden and mainly
Zawahiri...
The FBI documents contained damning evidence (audio and written)
collected between 1996-2002 tying these terror operations directly to
the U.S. persons in the State Department/CIA and Pentagon.
Also, how
the State Department got Congress to
grant huge amounts of funds to front NGOs and businesses
(mainly Turkish companies in US-listed/members of ATC)
to funnel money to the terrorist cells
in this region.
If this sounds crazy, please remember that the
former U.S. National Security Adviser (and a top Obama foreign policy
adviser -
Zbigniew Brzezinski),
admitted that
the U.S. created, organized and armed the Mujahadeen
in Afghanistan - including Bin Laden - to fight the Soviets.
Note: The
Afghan Mujahadeen
eventually morphed into Al Qaeda.
And the same National Security Adviser
wrote a book in 1997 (The Grand Chessboard - American
Primacy and its Geostrategic Imperatives) saying that the Caucasus and Central Asian
regions - the same 2 regions which Edmonds told us that NATO and
the U.S. deployed Zawahiri and Bin-Laden to influence - were the key to
geopolitical power.
For example, he wrote:
-
[The Central Asian Republics] are of
importance from the standpoint of security and historical ambitions
to at least three of their most immediate and more powerful
neighbors, namely Russia, Turkey and Iran, with China also signaling
an increasing political interest in the region. But the Eurasian
Balkans are infinitely more important as a potential economic prize:
an enormous concentration of natural gas and oil reserves is located
in the region, in addition to important minerals, including gold.
(p.124)
And the U.S. has backed the most dangerous and
radical Muslim terrorists
for decades. And the mainstream French paper Le Figaro alleged
that the CIA met with Bin Laden
2 months before 9/11.
The 9/11 Commissioners admit that they never got to
the bottom of 9/11.
For example:
-
9/11 Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton
says I dont believe for a minute
we got everything right, that the Commission was set up to fail,
that people should keep asking questions about 9/11, and that the
9/11 debate should continue
-
9/11 Commissioner Bob Kerrey
said that There are ample reasons
to suspect that there may be some alternative to what we outlined in
our version... We didnt have access...
He also
says that it might take a
permanent 9/11 commission to end the remaining mysteries of
September 11
