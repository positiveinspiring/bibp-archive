The High Court in Ireland (HCI) requested the
European Court of
Justice (ECJ)
review the Safe Harbor Treaty (SHT) between the European Union (EU)
and the U.S. to protect private user data while Facebook was caught
sharing digital communications from EU citizens with the National
Security Agency (NSA).
HCI Justice Gerard Hogan
ruled that,
"Facebook wont need to face an
investigation into its alleged activities, following a ruling made
by Irelands data protection commissioner who said the same."
Mark Schrems, post-graduate law student brought and member of the
group
Europe v.
Facebook (EVF) which claims in court documents that Bill Hawkes,
commissioner for data protection for the Irish government,
"wrongly
interpreted and applied the law governing the mass transfer of personal
data of Facebook users to the NSA."
Schrems showed that this
data exchange from Facebook to the NSA was
in compliance with the SHT, according to Hawkes.
EVF concludes that,
"enhanced threat to national and international
security from rogue States, terrorist groups and organized crime,
disclosures regarding mass and undifferentiated surveillance of personal
data by U.S. security forces, and the advent of social media" is being
used to justify complete surveillance on the public in every country.
The, "main development of the legal perspective" for protecting data
is outlined in the Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFR)
of the EU.
However Schrems states that Hawkes "did not adhere to the
requirements" of the law and behaved with "scrupulous steadfastness" as
far back as 1995.
In 2013, Viviane Reding, commissioner of the ECJ
said the NSA spying is a,
"breakdown of trust" between the U.S. and the
EU and "for ambitious and complex negotiations to succeed there needs to
be trust among the negotiating partners."
Since 1998, the SHT has
prohibited,
"the transfer of personal data to
non-European Union countries that do not meet the European Union
(EU) adequacy standard for privacy protection."
The NSA PRISM program is under fire in this case brought before the
HCI.
Under program PRISM (which extends as far back as 2007), the federal
government has been
data mining from tech corporations such as,
PRISM was
created during the
George W. Bush presidential administration and
has expanded further by President
Obama.
The
Protect America Act of 2007 gave private corporations immunity.
PRISM collaborated with Microsoft first and conducted surveillance
operations under the guise of searching for terrorist activity or cyber
espionage.
The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the NSA have been
acquiring,
"extracting audio, video, photographs,
emails, documents and connection logs that enable analysts to track
a persons movements and contacts over time."
In the U.S., the NSA is empowered by the
2001
U.S.
Patriot Act, Sec. 215 (50 U.S.C. ยง 1861), that states the federal
government can collect data on Americans if there is a claim of national
security compromise.
Metadata was siphoned under this clause for nearly a decade (that we
know of).
That innocuous metadata that the NSA has been collecting includes
trunk identifiers which are used to gather the metadata.
In fact, when hacking into a call, a trunk identifier can be used to
not only gather information about the call, but to listen in on the
conversation from both the caller and receiver.
Trunking is the way that the police can change their signal when on
the radio every few seconds so that it cannot be siphoned by hackers. It
is used by cell phone towers to encrypt the signal for a secure line.
Trunking follows the sender and receiver when they change channels so
that GPS-like surveillance is conducted.
This allows the surveillance apparatus to have a continues stream
regardless of when the channel changes every few seconds, which in turn
allow those listening in to have a steady signal without breaks.
Effectively, they can listen to the entire conversation and follow the
signal as it changes.
