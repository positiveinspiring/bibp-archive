# Message to all Plutocrats - A Declaration of Emergence

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/sociopol_globalelite196.htm

First things
first, congratulations on becoming
ridiculously wealthy.
Seriously, good job on conquering whatever
field you have managed to monopolize. I'm sure the accolades are
stacked up high in your trophy room. And hey, how about all that
money? Why, you could probably feed a small country with just the
money you wasted buying shit you don't need. And who can blame you,
right? I mean, you grew up in a society that preached
capitalism like it was a religion.
So what you got yours and
other people got screwed. They should have worked harder, right?
I
mean, you're like the head hunter in a tribe. It's not your fault
that the one guy in teepee two is a cripple with three kids to feed
and can't hunt to save his life. You can hunt,
that gives you privilege.
You earned your kill, dammit! It's yours
to do with what you wish.
To hell with that guy, let him starve! And
to hell with the moochers in teepee seven too. It's survival of the
fittest, right? Or, at least that's what you've been told your
entire life - whether or not it's just another pithy diatribe in a
long list of cultural clich√©s.
So what you bought it all
hook-line-and-sinker without questioning it? You're on top of the
world now. You deserve it.
I mean, hey, you're a "hard worker." It
took a lot of work lording potential firings over the little slave
laborers heads. It took a lot of work convincing debtors and
economic slaves to continue pushing mops and rubbing toilets so that
your company could shine like a diamond amidst the smog and acid
rain covered cluster-fuck you call a corporation.
It took a lot of
sleepless nights convincing yourself that you're not greedy, you're
just "monetarily-driven." It's not your fault that capitalism is
inherently a
system of theft and exploitation. You were born into it, just
like everybody else. You were conditioned for it, just like
everybody else. You were trained for it in public school, just like
everybody else.
And just because you regularly and systematically
resort to lying, brutality, torture, oppression, murder, and war to
defend your scam doesn't mean you are an outright criminal. Does it?
I mean, as long as you can make more money than the "other guy" and
progress as a corporation it's all good, right? You're doing the
world a service - trickle-down theory, and whatnot.
The bottom line is you're a "Have," and
all the "Have-nots" simply didn't work as hard as you did. Did they?
So what they grew up in ghettos and starved most of the time, that's
no excuse.
Sure, you never had to fight for your own survival, but
you did have to fight in order to create one of the biggest
corporations ever. You had to fight off similar corporations, often
resorting to lying, exploitation, and oppression to get ahead. You
had to fight for your company's right to corporate personhood.
You
had to fight tree-hugging, hippy environmentalists, all while
defending your company's systematic raping of the environment and
the rise of poverty that must occur if you are to become filthy,
stinking rich.
Hey, it's a dog-eat-dog world, and you're the top
dog. Everything's going to hell anyway, and you only have so many
years on this planet, so you might as well get what you can out of
it. Forget the next generation! You're going to get yours, and screw
anyone who tries to get in your way. Right?
Wrong!
The world is no longer your proverbial
oyster. It is slamming shut. And it will cut you right in half
unless you have the capacity to heed the following
Wake up to the level of your tyranny!
You plutocrats have created your own
economic apartheid. You imagine that you live under different rules
because you believe that you live in a different world. But you do
not.
Just because you can buy the rules made by government and fund
lobbyists who significantly contribute to the laws that Congress
writes and passes, does not mean that you don't still live in a REAL
world that is governed by REAL laws.
Just because you have a stranglehold on power does not mean you are immune to the
consequences of being irresponsible with that power.
Just because
your decrees are no longer issued by royal fiat but are instead
issued by lobbying and propaganda, doesn't make them any less
tyrannical. Your viscous cycle of consumption and compliance has
been deemed unethical and immoral. Your prompting us to move up the
"corporate ladder" is outdated nonsense, especially because it's your ladder
and you've rigged the climb by taking out important rungs.
We are
here to remind you that the real world DOES exist. Reality has
caught up to you. And before the real world comes crashing down on
all of us, with its very real laws, we will, as we must, resist your
arbitrary authority.
We will, as we must, break our natural
susceptibility to obedience.
Like
Frederick Douglas wrote,
"Knowledge makes a man unfit to be a
slave."
For you the most fundamental capital is
not money, but people.
You want your "human livestock" to be
intelligent enough to work the machine of slave labor, but dumb
enough, or fearful enough, that they don't question the machine
itself. And so far this has worked for you. You have heretofore been
under the delusion that consequences are only for the sheep (debt
slaves) and never for the shepherd (debt slave owners).
But we are
here to tell you that the consequences are coming. And you would
rather have these consequences come from the non-violent protest of
the political activist, than from the indifferent fury of Nature.
Your violence and exploitation of the natural world has come to an
end. We are here to reconnect you.
Like Bill Brenenson said,
"The
only remedy for disconnecting people from the natural world is
connecting them to it again."
Let the Great
Rewilding begin!
Your fiat currency has, for too long,
created and exacerbated poverty. More importantly, too long has it
allowed for indulgences in social engineering: namely, media
propaganda. Your creation of wars is no longer valid.
Be it a war
against the proverbial "other," playing upon people's notion of
nationalism and divisive patriotism, or against such vague concepts
as "drugs" or "terrorism," playing upon people's ignorance.
Just
because
human psychology is easy to manipulate
does NOT make your
manipulation moral or just.
Just because your indirect
ownership of the propaganda-machine known as corporate media has
duped people into suspended belief, does NOT make it moral that you
tell lies and use the veneer of independent and critical thinking to
keep people from thinking independently and critically. Just because
people have, henceforth, been mere amplifiers of the whispers of
power does NOT make it moral to persuade people to remain slaves.
Your fostering of slave on slave aggression has finally been routed
out and deemed immoral. Your false ethics have too long been
entrenched and have now been declared parochial and fundamentally
unsustainable to a healthy future for human beings.
In short, your
soft totalitarianism has become too hard. Your inverted
totalitarianism must be reverted. Your thorn in our side has become
crippling and therefore must be plucked.
Gone are the days where we get
"community" mixed up with "nationalism." Community is common unity.
Nationalism destroys common unity in that it draws imaginable lines
in the sand and breeds contempt for the "other."
It creates
stereotypes and prejudice, and creates bonds that can be
manipulated. And most destructive of all: it causes people to
believe that they are "doing right" by killing people outside their
own nation. Nationalism has become obsolete.
Like Howard Zinn wrote
in
A People's History of the United States,
"Nations are
not communities and never have been.
The history of any country,
presented as the history of a family, conceals the fierce conflicts
of interest (sometimes exploding, often repressed) between
conquerors and conquered, masters and slaves, capitalists and
workers, dominators and dominated in race and sex.
And in such a
world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the
job of thinking people, as
Albert Camus suggested, 'not to be on the side of the
executioners'."
Your commodification of all things has
come to an end.
Nature is not a commodity. Human beings are not
commodities. Gone are the days where your profiting from human
suffering is not realized as the diabolical
Ponzi scheme that it is. Gone are the days where your wars and
exploitation are perceived to be in our best interest. Gone are the
days where we believe that our survival is dependent upon
civilization.
We are
dependent ONLY upon clean air, clean
water, clean food, and healthy social relationships. Gone
are the days where your "war on terror" isn't seen as the
smokescreen that it is.
Besides, the war on terror - by design
- can
never come to an end. It only ends by becoming non-profitable for
you, the plutocrats. And the only way it becomes non-profitable is
by changing the way the economic system functions. And the only way
we change the economic system is through proactive citizenry in
solidarity against entrenched, power-mongering, plutocratic
politics.
Your empire of lies has come
unraveled. You've caused us to mistake a brand for an experience,
illusions for substance. Your exacerbation of despair has created a
passive citizenry of unquestioning cogs in a violent totalitarian
machine of exploitation. Your petty politics and pithy propaganda
will no longer work as a mechanism toward the dumbing-down of
society.
We are awake!
More and more of us are awaking every day.
And we have the moral obligation to say "no!" to your claims that
there is no other way. We now realize the consequences of our
complacency. It is writ large across the landscape.
We realize that
burying our heads in the sand only makes us blind. We will deprive
you of oxygen. We will lay siege to you. We will mock and shame you
with our art.
Like Thomas Jefferson said,
"We prefer dangerous freedom over
peaceful slavery."
So this is us hanging over the edge of that
dangerous freedom.
Deuces
caveat,
rulers beware...!
The Declaration of Emergence
We, the awake and aware citizens of the
world, hold these truths to be self-evident:
-
that the earth is the
sole source of life as we know it
-
that limited resources should be
utilized in ways that are equitable and wise
-
that compromise,
conformity, and compliance are no longer adequate means forward
-
that both compassionate and ruthless measures must be taken
immediately in order to conserve a healthy and habitable planet
From these truths springs the following list of demands:
-
Immediately dismantle the Federal
Reserve and all international central banks. Cease and desist any
negotiations with these independent entities whose debt-slavery is
the totalitarian force that threatens all of humanity on this
planet.
Any time a small group of people has the ability to create
wealth out of nothing, and then charge interest on it, they have the
ability to enslave the planet despite what type of government a
country claims to have.
Slavery is never moral.
And despite any Orwellian inclinations
you might have, slavery is not freedom.
-
The implementation of a United States
government that represent ALL of the people, our kids and the poor
and the elderly and workers, not just billionaires.
We are not going
to maintain this incredibly unequal distribution of wealth and
income in America. The way to
take back our democracy is to
get all of the special interest money out of politics.
United States Senator Bernie Sanders has already ratted you out,
saying,
"People have got to understand that the issue in Congress is
not what the media talks about on why can't Democrats and
Republicans get along.
That is not the issue. The issue is that, to
a very significant degree, the Congress of the United States of
America is controlled by a handful of extraordinarily wealthy people
and corporations, Wall Street being at the top of that list.
And
unless we address that issue, I fear very much for the middle class.
I fear very much for our kids, for low income people and for
seniors."
That said, legislation will no longer be written by
corporate lobbyists.
-
As a stopgap between the old, outdated,
exploitative, unsustainable system, and the new, updated,
community-based, sustainable system. Immediately cut ALL world
military spending in half.
The U.S. has spent roughly $21 trillion
on military defense since WWII. It's been estimated that $17 billion
per year would provide adequate food, water, education, health and
housing for every single person on the planet.
By these figures, war
is 20.5 times more expensive than lifting the entire world out of
poverty.
The money saved from cutting military spending can be used
toward universal education, universal healthcare, universal housing,
and environmental cleanup, as well as providing food and clean water
to impoverished nations and peoples.
Food and clean water is
a basic human need and should be available to everyone regardless of
their background or monetary position.
This will allow
people to rise up out of slavery and join in solidarity to create a
new world that benefits both nature and human beings.
War is not
peace!
We believe that the problem is of such
significance and the roots of tyranny so deep and profound that any
solution cannot be founded in reforms based within the current
political paradigm.
Therefore we further demand:
-
The implementation of a resource-based,
eco-conscious economy to replace the monetary-based,
ego-maniacal economy. Profit should NEVER come before people. The
heart should ALWAYS be greater than money.
We need a system with a
dynamic, relationship-based economics that strives for harmony and
balance; rather than a static, ownership-based economics that
brainwashes and pigeonholes people into mindless wage slaves.
With
enough time we can wean ourselves from our addiction to money and
discover what it truly means to be a human being with values.
Immediately discontinue increased subsidies for the rich that cut
subsidies for the poor.
Clean air, clean water, adequate food, and
adequate shelter should be the main priority before any and all
profit.
Equality is more important than equity. The importance of
life should always trump the importance of revenue.
-
The implementation of a
relationship-based system of government to replace the current
exploitation-based system of government. In other words: a
progressive democracy.
It will be the shift from a politic of greed
and one-up-manship to a politic of moderation and respect. There is
never only one solution, but potential solution might be the
implementation of a sortition-based system of appointing leadership,
with assembly powers to vote out "bad seeds."
We have to admit that
the election-based system (and especially representative elections)
of appointing leadership has failed miserably. A lottery balances
out a system of governance through simple probability, while
empowering citizenry and preventing power from corrupting.
Government, as it is today, must transition toward a decision making
system which is based upon technical competency and verifiable
scientific reference instead of a competitive system which is based
upon selfish agendas and anti-intellectual conservatism.
This new
sustainable government will use science and research to determine
the healthiest direction for social progression.
-
Immediately discontinue any and all
attempts to use the judicial system as a tool to exercise control,
authority and power in the interest of oppression and personal gain.
To include, but not limited to:
-
indefinite detention (NDAA)
-
CISPA
-
ACTA
-
drone strikes
-
torture
-
arbitrary justice
-
warrantless
searches and the continual monitoring of citizens
-
the ability to
transfer citizens to another country under a system known as
extraordinary rendition
-
debtor prisons
-
worst of all, the
assassination of US citizens
The judicial system should be used for
one thing, and one thing only: justice.
The erosion of due process
and the dilution of constitutional rights like these, and other such
tyrannical unconstitutional acts, must immediately be discontinued.
Like Watson & Jones wrote,
"Just last week (Feb 2013), the Justice
Department re-affirmed its position that the Obama administration
can use armed drones to assassinate Americans.
Under the NDAA, the
whole of the United States has been declared a 'battlefield,'
meaning that drones may soon be used to execute American citizens on
U.S. soil. A government that resorts to killing its own citizens
without any legal process whatsoever is clearly a dictatorship
engaged in domestic oppression.
The only imaginable scenario under
which this program would be justifiable was if the U.S. was under a
state of martial law and the government was on the verge of
collapse."
-
Immediately discontinue any and all
witch-hunts on whistleblowers such as
Julian Assange, or any
innocent activists or hacktivists practicing their freedom of
speech.
Immediately release
Bradley Manning from custody.
Immediately dismantle
FEMA and DHS.
Also, the
NSA, FBI,
CIA and all
other intelligence agencies must heretofore become completely
transparent or they will be forced into complete transparency by
such entities as Anonymous. 70% of our intelligence workload is
outsourced to private corporations.
This is an atrocity! In a true
democracy power should never be privatized.
-
This doctrine reserves the right to be
open-ended and forever amendable.
You do not have to be the Enemy!
You will condemn us. You will label us
the enemy. You will call us impractical. You will call us insane.
You will call us regressive. You will call us counterproductive. You
will condemn us to obscurity. You will use hypocrisy to argue that
we must accept and work within the current modes of power.
But we
are not concerned with self-promotion, public opinion, or fame.
We
know all the rules but you do not know us. All we need is courage
and hope: courage to speak for a healthy world and hope that people
will choose to be healthy.
Ideas are more powerful than standing
armies. They are bulletproof.
This essay is a weapon in itself, and
has the potential to accelerate our liberation. Each one of us is
the answer, even you. It's time to come down off your high-horse,
plutocrats. It's time for you to see that the pedestal you stand
upon is nothing more than a cartoon in your brain, it's no more real
than the pseudo-powers you toss around in the form of money.
You
don't have to be the enemy. You have a choice. You have the
chance to become true heroes.
At this current point in human history
nobody is more capable of choosing heroism than you are. You have
all the means at your disposal to achieve whatever ends you desire.
Those ends can be unhealthy and immoral or healthy and moral.
So far
you have chosen the unhealthy immoral path, but we think that is
only because you were raised and conditioned within a hierarchal
system that is itself unhealthy and immoral.
Only you can break the
spell. Only you can raise yourself up to the consciousness of your
slavery.
So far your heroism has been infantilized by hierarchy.
Your belief that you can "reach the top" and "be the best" has
caused you to lose sight of what it really means to be the best. It
means doing the right thing.
Up until this point you are merely a
pseudo-hero. You have capitalized. You have monopolized. You have
more than likely exploited, conned, and lied to people to reach the
top.
Whatever, it is what it is. Now is your chance to flip the
tables on the power dynamic. Now is your chance to REALLY make a
difference.
Now is your chance to do the right thing. How? You must
transform yourself into a New-hero and
practice hero-expiation.
Through reciprocity and recompense your power can go from
egotistical-tyrannical power to ecomoral-prestigious power.
As a
New-hero with moral, healthy action on your side, you can do what
everybody has always dreamed of doing: change the world for the
better. Through the practice of hero-expiation you will become
a symbol for progressive sustainability by tipping the scales on the
power dynamic and acting as a catalyst for healthy change.
Plutocrats, we beseech you: become heroes over power as
opposed to simply heroes with power. It's not too late to
do the right thing. The world is ripe for this new kind of power
dynamic to reveal itself. And only YOU have the power to achieve it.
Like Joseph Campbell wrote,
"A hero is not a champion of things
become but of things becoming; the dragon to be slain by him is precisely the monster of the status quo."
