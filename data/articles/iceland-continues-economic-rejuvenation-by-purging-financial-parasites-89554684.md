Iceland Purging Lords of
Money
Iceland is showing the world what real independence from the bankers means.
The Nordic island has become the first
country to criminally charge a world leader as a result of
the
2008 economic crisis.
Former Prime Minister
Geir Haarde, 73,
was found guilty of,
failing to adequately inform other
Icelandic officials of events that led up to the 2008 financial crisis
according to an April 23 New York Times article.
As part of Haardes final verdict, two of the
original six charges were dropped and the other three were cleared.
These included gross neglect of duty and
failure to reduce the size of the banking system, charges that were more
serious and could have put him behind bars for years.
Haarde, who served as Icelands prime minister from June 2006 to February
2009, will not actually have to serve any jail time but the trial was
indicative of Icelands re-establishment of its sovereignty after defaulting
on the bankers. As many as 90 bankers and politicians are expected to be
brought to trial this year for crimes related to the targeted debt crisis
Iceland faced.
Iceland was the only European country that dared to default on the bankers.
In February 2011 Icelands President Olafur
R. Grimsson refused to sign a $5B bailout bill and told the bankers he
was going to put the bill to a referendum.
Although 44 of the 63 members of Parliament had
passed the bill, Grimsson said he was responding to a popular demand for a
plebiscite after more than 42K of Icelands 318K inhabitants signed a
petition asking him to block it.
Icelanders absorbed some of the costs itself but forced foreign investors to
take the biggest hit. Not deterred by horror stories about an unthinkable
economic demise that have prevented countries like Greece and Portugal from
defaulting, Iceland has proved that default was the best thing it could
have done.
As a result, not only has the economy not
collapsed since last year, but its gross domestic product is expected to
increase by 2.6% this year. Much of that growth is based on increased
production, mainly in tourism and the fishing industry.
In contrast, most other European economies are
either stagnant or in decline. Even the Times article admitted that many
economists say Icelands recovery was aided by the collapse of the banks.
Icelands recovery is a shining example for countries like Greece, Ireland
and Spain to follow.
History has proven that countries experience
growth once they get out from under the parasitic burden of debt to the
bankers. National Socialist Germany from 1933-39 is a perfect example.
Real wealth is measured in terms of growth in agriculture, manufacturing and
services. Greece and Spain have more than half of their highly energetic
youth unemployed, producing nothing. In the U.S. 55K factories have shut
down in the last decade.
Iceland has shown that with regained sovereignty comes justice and dignity.
Corrupt politicians and bankers can be brought to trial.
Further asserting its independence, Iceland was the first country, last
fall, to recognize Palestine as an independent nation, a move no country
under the yoke of the international bankers has had the guts to do.
