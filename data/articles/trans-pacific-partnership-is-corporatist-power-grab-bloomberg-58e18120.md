# Trans Pacific Partnership Is "Corporatist Power Grab" - Bloomberg

Stop the Anti-American Power Grab
The U.S. Trade Representative - the federal
agency responsible for negotiating trade treaties - has said that the
details of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) are
classified due to "national security".
A Congressman who has seen the text of the
treaty
says:
There is no national security purpose in
keeping this text secret
this agreement hands the sovereignty of
our country over to corporate interests.
It will,
To give an idea of what would happen to
American law if TPP passes, just look at Ecuador
Its courts awarded billions against Chevron
for trashing huge swaths of rainforest. But then a private arbitration
panel
simply ignored the countrys court system.
If TPP passes, American courts will be
sidelined as well. (Conservatives might want to read
this and
this.)

Pacific Trade Deal Needs More WikiLeaking
by William Pesek

from
Bloomberg Website
Self-awareness often eludes U.S. officials who push American interests
on Asia.
John Kerrys visit to Vietnam was a
case in point as the secretary of state implored the government to
ratify
the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
In his pitch earlier this week, Kerry said the U.S.-led trade deal would
bring "transparency" and "accountability" to the communist nation,
helping it become a more open society that supports free expression. An
odd thought, considering the Big Brother-like secrecy enshrouding the
treaty on the U.S. side.
The pro-TPP argument goes as follows:
This is the moment Asias reformers have
been waiting for.
Its a chance for Japan to take on
vested interests, Malaysia to kill growth-stifling
affirmative-action policies, Vietnam to rein in bloated state-owned
enterprises and Singapore to spur innovation.
Think of TPP as an economic Trojan horse
- a means of shaking up stagnant political systems by stealth.
Yet the dearth of details about the treaty
is exactly why Asia should opt out of the most ambitious free-trade deal
in U.S. history.
U.S. lawmakers and civil-liberties groups have complained for some time
about the opacity surrounding the treatys terms. Mild grousing turned
into outrage last month
after WikiLeaks did what Barack
Obamas White House refuses to:
share portions of the document with the
public.
The draft of the intellectual-property
rights chapter by Julian Assanges outfit validated the worst
fears - that TPP is a corporatist power grab. Rather than heed the
outcry, the U.S. doubled down on secrecy, refusing to disclose more
details.
Hasnt the U.S. wondered why so many of East Asias most promising
democracies have so far avoided the treaty?
The popular excuse for why,
-
Indonesia
-
the
Philippines
-
South Korea
-
Taiwan
-
Thailand,
...arent yet among the 12 TPP economies is that they arent ready or are trapped by their own
timidity.
A better explanation is that their leaders
realize that truly transparent and accountable governments, to borrow
Kerrys own words, shouldnt be leading their people into the unknown.
Take Japan, which recently spirited a government secrets bill into law
without public debate, even though most Japanese oppose it.
The ostensible reason for the move by Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe was to ensure confidential sharing of
intelligence with the U.S. in the post-Edward Snowden world. But
human-rights groups are up in arms over its far-reaching and ambiguous
language and the potential jail terms for journalists and
whistle-blowers.
In form and timing, it had TPP written all
over it.
"The vagueness of the secrets act
reflects a basic theme of Japanese governance, which is I work for
the government, therefore I know more than you, therefore you should
do what I say," says Colin Jones, a legal scholar at Doshisha Law
School in Kyoto, Japan.
That, in a nutshell, explains the Obama
administrations TPP argument:
Oh, dont worry, we know what were
doing and it will be fine.
The trouble is that this poses a demand for
trust, with no opportunity to verify.
You know you have a transparency problem when citizens of a democracy
need to
rely on WikiLeaks for details on changes to laws on Internet
use, labor, environmental and food-safety standards, and the cost and
availability of drugs.
Its worth considering something
Google Inc.
Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt told CNBC in December 2009:
"If you have something that you dont
want anyone to know, maybe you shouldnt be doing it in the first
place."
So why is the Obama administration behaving
as if it runs a closed Communist Party state?
The answer can only be, To circumvent the
legislative process.
"If you read, write, publish, think,
listen, dance, sing or invent; if you farm or consume food; if
youre ill now or might one day be ill, TPP has you in its
crosshairs," Assange said last month.
If instituted, TPP "would trample over
individual rights and free expression as well as ride roughshod over
the intellectual and creative commons."
Asian governments should reject TPP unless
they can tell their people exactly what is in it, and why and how it
will affect their lives.
Thanks to Assange, we now know that the U.S.
wants signatories to allow patent changes that could raise the cost of
food and health care in developing nations, including increasing the
price of treating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.
Is that progress?
Last month, 151 House Democrats, members of Obamas own party, sent a
letter to the White House stating their opposition to granting him
fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements, citing a lack of
congressional consultation.
-
Why have officials from Johnson &
Johnson, Cisco Systems Inc. and General Electric Co. seen
details that skeptical legislators such as Elizabeth Warren and
Alan Grayson cant?
-
What would Americas founders make
of this process?
Asian governments should hold public
hearings, encourage a public debate, and let legislatures see and vote
on the TPP based on the treatys fully disclosed terms.
If that isnt something they can do, Asians
should say no to a trade deal thats as democratic and transparent as a
one-party state.
