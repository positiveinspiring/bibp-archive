The US is getting ready to censor the Internet and they are using
the Wikileaks event as a pretext to do so. The US government has been looking
for a way to hide the truth from their citizens for a while now and this
might just be what they were looking for.
Wayne Madison in this TV interview explains exactly why Wikileaks is the
pretext to censor the Internet and bring about a new "patriot act" for the
Internet, a well thought out long awaited plan.
The Internet,
"is under worse attack in this administration than it was than
in the previous administration".
