# Ukraine Crisis Goes Nuclear

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/sociopol_globalization_eu09.htm

Reports allege that some 20 members from the
armed Neo-Nazi front, Right Sector, attempted to storm the Zaporizhia
nuclear power plant, in Energodar city, Zaporizhia province.
The Voice of Russia reported in an
article titled, "Right
Sector attempts to seize largest NPP in Ukraine," that:
Policemen of the city of Energodar have
detained 20 activists of the Right Sector, who tried to seize the
Zaporozhye NPP.
According to the leader of the
Zaporozhye branch of the organization, the militants were afraid
that the city would fall in the hands of supporters of
federalization.
Right Sector, along with other Neo-Nazi
militant fronts, spearheaded
violence that led to the overthrow of the elected government of Ukraine in
late 2013 and early 2014 in what was called the "Euromaiden" protests.
Right Sector has since been used as a
paramilitary organization by Kiev in an attempt to assert control over
the rest of the country.
Its mounting list of atrocities has led Kiev
and its NATO backers to increasingly deny ties to the extremist front -
however, it is clear that the group is operating nationally and
in tandem with security forces loyal to Kiev.
Zaporizhia province neighbors Donetsk, which
along with Luhansk province, recently held referendums leading to
greater autonomy from Kiev and closer ties to neighboring Russia.
Zaporizhia, laying between Donetsk and now
Russian Crimea, could potentially be the next province to escape out
from under the unelected regime currently occupying Kiev.
NATOs "Nuclear Option"
The storming of Zaporizhia nuclear power
plant by Neo-Nazis may appear to be an act of extreme irresponsibility
carried out by witless, dangerous thugs, but the operation may have a
much more sinister purpose.
A May 7 Reuters article titled, "NATO
experts advise Ukraine on nuclear plant safety," stated:
NATO experts have visited Ukraine to
advise authorities there on improving the safety of nuclear power
plants, gas pipelines and other critical infrastructure amid growing
violence and fears of conflict with Russia, officials said on
Wednesday.
The article would continue by stating:
Asked if the study was carried out
because of Kievs fears of Russian intervention in Ukraine, Dolhov
said one reason was "possible destabilization" in an area where
strategic infrastructure was located.
Ukraine told the U.N. atomic watchdog in
March it was reinforcing the protection of its nuclear power plants
because of "a grave threat to the security" of the country posed by
the Russian military.
A rebellion in the east has raised the
prospect that Ukraine, a country of around 45 million people the
size of France, could be carved up or even descend into civil war.
And perhaps the most telling statement of
all claimed:
Ukraine is not a member of NATO and the
alliance has said it will not get involved militarily in Ukraine.
But Ukraine and NATO have increased cooperation and Ukraine has
asked NATO members for non-lethal equipment such as uniforms.
Indeed, Ukraine is not a NATO member, and it
is almost inconceivable under what circumstances NATO troops could enter
Ukrainian territory - almost inconceivable.
But a threat to one or more of Ukraines 15
nuclear reactors might give NATO the pretext necessary to deploy troops
into Ukraine, particularly in the east where Kiev is unable to assert
control.
While NATO cannot justify intervening in
Ukraines internal political crisis directly, it may attempt to make a
case that a nuclear catastrophe directly threatens NATO members.
The aftermath of
Chernobyl
Ukraine is the sight of the worst nuclear
accident in human history when in 1986, just north of Kiev, a reactor at
the Chernobyl power plant exploded, exposing millions to radioactive
contamination across Ukraine itself, Russia, and Europe.
The reactor still poses a threat to human
health and the environment even today.
With this catastrophe in mind, NATO may
believe that by provoking a security risk to Ukraines remaining
reactors, particularly the facility in Zaporizhia - Europes largest -
it can create enough fear and support for a possible intervention in
Zaporizhia province, preventing anti-Kiev forces from peeling the region
away from Kiev as they have in Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea.
NATOs Dangerous Game
Threatens All of Humanity
Whether NATO is in fact attempting to
intentionally create threats to Ukraines nuclear power plants as a
pretext to intervene more directly in Ukraine or not is irrelevant.
It is directly supporting the regime in Kiev
that had organized and continues to perpetuate Right Sector who is
currently creating such threats. However, with NATO
being behind the chemical attack in Damascus, Syria in August of 2013 -
the idea of NATO fabricating a similar pretext in Ukraine is not beyond
the realm of possibilities.
NATOs inability to condemn and cut ties
with the regime in Kiev, allows the menace of Right Sector to persist.
The solution, likewise, is not more NATO intervention across the rest of
Ukraine, but rather the undoing of the unelected regime it has put into
power in Kiev in the first place.
The disaster in Chernobyl involved a single
reactor. Zaporizhia has six reactors.
Threatening the security and safe operation
of the facility in Zaporizhia either directly as a ploy to intervene, or
indirectly by propping up the regime that created and continues to use
Right Sector to augment its struggling security forces, puts the entire
world in danger.
The fallout from Zaporizhia in the event of
a catastrophe could effect millions across Europe, Russia, and Eurasia.
Should Ukraines Zaporizhia facility
continue to be put in danger, it is far more realistic and justifiable
for Russia, not NATO, to mobilize and deploy, or support within
Zaporizhia province, security forces to provide ample protection.
For NATO, if a pretext to intervene is their
goal, it will require time and may never materialize at all, considering
their failures in Syria and the lack of trust or legitimacy they now
command.
In the meantime, Russia and its allies in
eastern Ukraine can continue working to move Zaporizhia away from the
dangerous regime in Kiev and its equally dangerous and irresponsible
backers in NATO - just as has been done with Crimea, Donetsk, and
Luhansk.
