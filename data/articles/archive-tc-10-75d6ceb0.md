Greetings to you. Pleasure to be with all of you this night.
We have
lots of information to share... But as is usual in your dimension,
there is a time limit. So, we are going to give you the most
concise, simplified story possible. We will present what we wish to
present, and then the rest of the evening will be questions and
answers with you.
We understand the subject is Japan's ancient extraterrestrial
connection. But before we get more specific about that, we have to
give you a little historical background about the creation of Homo
sapiens on Earth. That information will fit directly in with the
information about ancient Japan. It is actually quite significant.
We'll condense some of this and try to make a complete story.
There were a group of extraterrestrials, the Lyrans primarily, and
the Sirians as a secondary group, who were engaged in genetic
experiments to create a new breed of humans on Earth. One of the
major purposes for this undertaking was because these
extraterrestrials wanted to create new upgraded bodies that they
could eventually incarnate into. So this genetic project was a very
long and involved one, taking many thousands of years.
There was
DNA used from the extraterrestrials mixed with the
indigenous DNA from the primates. This eventually created the
prototypes which in your history you have called "Adam" and "Eve".
So in that sense, there was not just one Adam and one Eve, they were
representing a whole group of prototypes all over the planet.
There were many genetic projects going on simultaneously around the
Earth. The primary ones were in the area of Africa and Asia. These
different genetic projects going on all over the Earth account for
the different races on your planet. However, in this time, all of
these projects were creating all the races on Earth except the Asian
race.
You had the Caucasian prototypes, Negroid prototypes,
brown-skinned prototypes (like Native Americans), but no Asians.
Here is where the story may sound like science fiction... As these
experiments were going on, the genetic engineers received a visit
from some extraterrestrials from the future. Before we go further
with what the people from the future said, we are going to say one
other thing.
Up until this point, the extraterrestrials interacting with Earth
were usually in conflict with each other. There was conflict
throughout the whole galactic family. No matter what they did, they
could never seem to resolve their conflicts.
So, one of the desires
for this genetic project was that the new humans would have an
advanced body which would be able to integrate energy in a different
way so that they would be the first species to begin resolving
conflict. Quite a burden for a new race.
So, these beings from the future came to see the genetic engineers.
This is what they said:
"Your genetic project, as we view it in the
future, has not succeeded. You've created too much diversity on
Earth and the peoples of Earth are in conflict with each other. They
are not fulfilling what you want them to fulfill in the future. You
must do something else. You must do something to fix this."
You can imagine that this was quite a shock for the genetic
engineers who had put generations of work into this genetic project.
So, they sought further advice from these future beings.
"What can
we do," they said, "to create a more unified Earth in the future?"
The beings from the future then said that the genetic engineers
needed to incorporate another new prototype on Earth so that
eventually, in the future, as all of the natures of the different
prototypes began integrating, harmony would be the result.
This is when they began working on the prototypes for the Asian
race. They took some DNA from some civilizations, which we will name
in a moment, which had a strong sense of unification within their
people. They combined this DNA with the Earth prototypes. As they
did this, they began to create a new prototype race that would
eventually, eons in the future, help to integrate the entire planet.
This new prototype was for the Asian race.
The extraterrestrial beings whose DNA they took was a group that you
now call the
Zeta Reticuli. These beings, for those of you who are
not familiar with them, are the ones who are small with large dark
eyes. They also took Pleiadian DNA as well, which was already in the
other prototypes.
And, they took DNA from the Sirians which was also
present in the other prototypes. They made a whole new mixture. That
is what began to create the Asian race.
For you to understand the significance of this, we will first tell
you some of the qualities of the Zeta Reticuli. Within the Zeta
Reticuli, there is very little individuality. They operate as a
group mind. Not only is there little individuality on the
personality level, but there is also nearly no individuality in
terms of their physical bodies.
They nearly look identical. The
genetic engineers felt that this race was really the perfect race to
use to create the integrated race on Earth because they have such
little individuality. They felt that that factor in the future was
what was going to help bring the entire planet together.
Now, we will point out to you how
the Asian races manifests the Zeta Reticuli qualities.
Your race has hardly any variation in skin tone.
There is some, but not much compared to other races. There is also
not a lot of variation in eye and hair color, either. And you also
don't display the wide range of different body types that other
races do.
Those are just external things. However, where the power lies is in
the internal qualities of the Zeta Reticuli that the Asian race
possesses. For one thing, the Zetas have a very solid and inner
sense of their spiritual connection to All That Is, or God.
The
Zetas are very interested in ritual to express their spirituality.
And, their minds are very much linked together even in daily life.
These qualities are what the genetic engineers felt were so
essential to bring to the Earth.
The main areas where the prototypes were created were in areas of
Japan, for the most part, that are no longer above the water. It is
always a good idea when you are doing a genetic project like
creating prototypes, that you do it on an island or in an isolated
area in order to contain the experiment. So, this is why the area of
Japan was chosen. Any further south, it would have been too hot.
So, once the prototypes were created, they were assisted or tended
by various extraterrestrial groups, most notably Pleiadian. In the
ancient days, as the prototypes began reproducing themselves and
populating the area, the Pleiadians did whatever they could to teach
spirituality to these new prototypes.
The Pleiadians also tried to
incorporate into their teachings some of the ancient spiritual
principles of the Zeta Reticuli as well.
The Zeta Reticuli were not physically present for the teaching of
the prototypes. So, the Pleiadians taught whatever spirituality they
understood that the Zetas practiced in their ancient past. We know
this story is convoluted because it is so complicated, but we will
simply say that the past of the Zeta Reticuli is what we consider
Vegan [from the Vega system].
So basically the Pleiadians were not
only teaching Pleiadian spirituality, but they were attempting to
teach ancient Vegan spirituality as well.
Once the prototypes began reproducing and the area became populated,
groups were taken to other areas to spread out their development,
such as in Mongolia, etc. In these ancient days, the prototypes were
reproducing and becoming a new race. They had much interaction with
the Pleiadians. In a sense, the Pleiadians became like guides and
parents to this new race. There was a very strong bond that was
formed.
Within Japan, you have some very ancient rituals of which you may
not even be aware of their origin. Throughout time, these rituals
have changed and adapted to the present day. The ancient rituals
were different from those being done today, but what is being done
is helping to carry on that ancient memory.
For instance, what is now your
tea ceremony used to be a very
ancient Vegan ritual that the Pleiadians taught to you.
Before we go
further with this, we are going to tell you that the Pleiadians
focused a lot of their teaching in the birthplace of the Asian race,
which was an area of Japan (which was larger then, with more
islands) and there were other teachers of several different
extraterrestrial lineages given to other groups of prototypes in
other locations as well.
The original Vegan form of the tea ceremony actually lasted three
days and three nights. They didn't teach you the long version. They
condensed it. But the ritual, as the Pleiadians understood it, was
very important to the Vegans. Because of this, the Pleiadians felt
it was very important to pass it along to you. To the Vegans, it was
the ultimate form of expression of spirituality. It also combined
body movement as well, and running of energy.
Also, in the traditional Japanese architecture there is Pleiadian
influence as well. There are certain qualities in traditional
Japanese/Pleiadian architecture that are still present today in a
different form.
For instance, the use of a gate or
threshold to
separate environments (or to separate the energy of different
environments) was very important to the Pleiadians and so they
passed that along. So, this manifests itself today in some of the
landscaping that is done in Japan.
There is a change in consciousness when you enter a Japanese garden.
It is meant to be another world. In the original days, the
Pleiadians taught a much more complicated version. Usually the more
complex version was used by priests or holy people rather than the
general public.
The best way to describe this ancient version is as
follows:
The person starts out in the physical world. Let's say they
eventually want to get to a place where their consciousness can be
in total communion with God.
They will go physically through seven
separate environments until they get to the environment that is the
most spiritual in vibration.
Moving through the seven separate
environments was a way to gradually shift the consciousness one step
at a time until it could get to that spiritual place.
We would like to give a side note here, because this is important
for the channel [Lyssa Royal] to know.
The dream she had of placing
her forehead over the thresholds and going through several
thresholds was her memory of this seven-step process. For
convenience, over time this seven step process was shortened or used
for very specific ceremonies.
The traditional Japanese rooms being sparse and harmoniously
organized is very Pleiadian as well. Simplicity was very important
to them. So is the harmony of the living space with Nature. So, many
of these Pleiadian qualities were passed on and then the Japanese
people have developed them even further. It would be difficult for
us to tell you about each one because much of the ancient memory has
been lost.
However, it is important to know that that
connection
with the Pleiadians is very ancient and is very deep within the
Japanese people.
Of all the races on Earth physically, we would say that the
Pleiadians resemble the Asians the most. There are many different
subgroups within the Pleiadians, so there are light-haired and
light-eyed Pleiadians as well. But in one of the most dominant
Pleiadian groups, the females are very petite like this channel, and
many of your women as well. Within this dominant Pleiadian group the
men also are not very large.
One of the most dominant features of the Pleiadians that you [the
Japanese] carry is the eyes. Even the light-skinned and light-eyed
Pleiadians have eyes that are almond-shaped and more Asian-looking,
rather than Caucasian. However, their eyes are larger than yours.
So, if you met a Pleiadian on the street, he or she could pass as
human but would look unusual. You might think the Pleiadian is a
combination of Asian and Caucasian. So even today physically, you
have a lot of the qualities of the Pleiadians. Theirs was the
dominant genetics used for the prototype projects.
One other body quality is that of many of the races on Earth, the
Asian has less body hair. That is a Pleiadian quality most
definitely, but it is also a Zeta Reticuli quality as well.
Let us talk about this object for a moment. [Germane holds up a
statue of a Dogu.] Some of you may recognize this as a Dogu.
The
idea of
the Dogu has been very important to maintain among your
people, even if it is just in thought.
This is because symbolically,
it reminds you on a very deep level of your star heritage. In a
sense, the idea behind it is similar to
the Kachina dolls of the
Native Americans. In every culture on Earth there is a way that has
been preserved to remember the star heritage. However, most
civilizations have lost the ability to really understand the
symbolism on that level.
The most obvious question would be, "Is this a literal depiction of
the ancient extraterrestrials?" We would say that no, it is not
literal. But it incorporates many ideas regarding your
extraterrestrial forefathers that you've wanted to keep alive.
Among all ancient peoples, even hypothetically people who have no
star heritage (which is not true on your Earth), the natural
tendency of primitive peoples is to create power objects which
reflect the archetypes within. Often, anthropologists have
misunderstood the meaning of these power objects and have thought
that primitive people worshipped them.
Though that may have happened
in later times, the early primitive peoples recognized these power
objects as being a reflection of what is inside of them.
One of the power objects that primitive peoples used nearly without
exception was a figure that represented fertility, or the Mother
Goddess. Birth, of course, was one of the most important things for
a primitive people because it kept their people alive.
And so,
fertility is sacred. So this figure combines many ideas. First of
all on the very basic level, it is a figure depicting the Mother
Goddess.
But then one may say,
"Why does the Mother Goddess figure
look so extraterrestrially influenced?"
Obviously, the story we just told you says that your creation and
your very reproduction is because of the genetic projects done by
these extraterrestrials.
So, the extraterrestrial connection had to
be depicted along with the Mother Goddess. It has been a long time
since people on Earth understood the various totem or symbols who
were on Earth during those days.
You will find that the Dogu, in its intricate work, also expresses
Pleiadian energy, Sirian energy, and Zeta/Vegan energy. The very
oldest Dogu, (most of them are not recovered whole anymore) have
very clear depictions of the symbols of these ancient
extraterrestrials.
Most of these ancient Dogu have disintegrated
over time and so you've not yet recovered a whole one. On some of
these old Dogu you will find serpent symbols, which represent the
Sirians. You will also find bird symbols which could either be
Pleiadian or Lyran. Those symbols were a tribute to the
extraterrestrial Mother Goddess, so to speak.
You know, many people may wonder why we feel it is so important to
speak about the extraterrestrial heritage of human beings. Some
people think there are too many problems on Earth now, so why put
your head in the stars? However, in a sense, Earth humans are like
abandoned children.
You've grown up, just about reaching adulthood,
and have never been told who your parents are. A child who doesn't
know who his parents are grows up confused and has many problems
throughout his life. Until he discovers who he is, he may never be
at peace.
So, we feel it is so important for the human species to no
longer feel like an abandoned child, and to know that they have a
family out in the cosmos. Once they begin to know their identity and
their heritage, they will feel so much stronger to tackle whatever
problems face them in present time.
You've been left many, many tools and clues to teach you about this
heritage. There are objects like this Dogu, and there are so many
legends. In every aspect of society there is a clue. If humans will
open their eyes and their hearts and not be afraid to discover the
unknown, they will discover those clues. Since all of you are here
tonight because the subject interests you, then obviously mankind is
beginning to awaken.
From our point of view, the entire project on Earth has been a
success. We see all of you humans on Earth uniting together in the
future. You do become the planetary species that your forefathers
hoped you would become. That outcome is assured.
But now, you all
have to simply help the process along by being who you naturally
are. We would suggest that you feel proud of your heritage, for your
planetary species is the product of many different groups of your
forefathers who, in the heavens, could not solve their conflicts.
But they will now do so through you.
And, the most amazing part of
this is that reincarnationally you on Earth are your forefathers.
Those extraterrestrial genetic engineers of so long ago are now you
reincarnated here today to help continue the project. You know
exactly what you are doing, and it will be a success. May we be the
first to congratulate you.
We are going to allow you to take a short break. In the next half we
will take questions... We look forward to speaking with you again.
[Break]
Greetings again. Questions please.
Question: Please discuss Japan's power spots like
Mt. Fuji and Tenkawa Shrine.
First of all, let us address Mt. Fuji. There are major power spots
all over the world that correspond to the human chakras. It is our
perception that Mt. Fuji corresponds with the crown chakra of the
planet. This makes a lot of sense also if you think about something
else we've said in the past, which we will repeat... Japan has a
very unique role in this time of transition.
Throughout your
planet's history you've had all the wisdom from the East, and you've
had all the technology from the West. The West has never wanted to
accept the East, and the East hasn't wanted to accept the West.
Thus, the fundamental energies of the East and West have been
conflicting.
There needs to be a doorway on the planet where both the East and
the West can come together and integrate. Japan is that doorway. It
is quite appropriate that you would have the crown chakra of the
planet here to help you with that integrative process. As many
Japanese people are awakening to their own spirituality, they are
helping to integrate the energies of the East and West.
Fuji-san represents a doorway through which that can be done.
Whenever you visit that area, your own crown chakra gets activated.
As you work with the energy of the area and help to activate the
energy of Fuji, you are also helping this entire planetary
integrative process. We would say that the energy of Fuji is
essential for the planet's integration.
We know that there has been
much rumor about Fuji-san erupting. We've heard all the gloom and
doom prophesy for that, however, our understanding is that should
Fuji-san erupt in that way, it would represent a tremendous kundalini experience for the planet... Too much energy moving too
fast.
We perceive instead that simply its activation will occur
slowly and gradually at a pace that is comfortable for the entire
planet.
Regarding
Tenkawa Shrine, that place has a very ancient connection.
The shrine itself is not that ancient, of course, but the site
itself goes back to the time of the prototype work. It is our
understanding that the area around Tenkawa Shrine, perhaps about 1/2
kilometer diameter around it, was one of the major schooling areas
by the Pleiadians for the new prototypes. So, there is a strong Pleiadian energy there.
The symbol of
Tenkawa Shrine, the three circles in a triangle, is a
symbol that has been used by your extraterrestrial forefathers long
before Earth was in existence. The symbol of the triad has always
represented integration. It means one polarity, its opposite, and
the integration of the two.
If you remember what we said earlier, it
was hoped that the Asian race would serve as an integrative point
for the entire planet, then you can see why this symbol is so
appropriate for the shrine, which was an old educational site.
That is the most important translation of the symbol. There is one
more, however. The three points represent Pleiadian energy, Zeta
Reticuli energy, and Earth energy. In a sense it was a proclamation
of the bonds that exist between the three. So from that perspective,
it is a very sacred site. Does that answer the question?
Question: Please also explain why many of the power spots are on the
same line from each other.
There are energetic grid lines that run around your planet...
Imagine that the globe is covered in a cloth. The fabric of that
cloth, the actual threads, is like those grid lines. Where the lines
cross represent power points. Whenever humans are seeking to make a
shrine or sacred spot, they are naturally drawn to those
intersections of grid lines.
So, the fact that there are some sacred
spots on the same line is representative of that same idea, it is
one thread of the tapestry. The ancients were very aware of that
when they built their sacred places.
Question: I have heard that
Amaterasu, which literally means the Sun
Goddess, has a direct connection to Andromeda.
When I look at the Dogu, the image of Andromeda comes to my mind. When we were at Machu
Picchu, I met a being who you said was Andromedan. Could you talk
about this experience more, as well as the Andromedan connection
with ancient Japan?
First of all, we will answer the question about
Japan's connection
with the ancient Andromedans, but will have to give a brief answer
to the personal aspects of your question. We are going to try to
simplify this because the information may be quite complex.
Each civilization, including extraterrestrial civilizations, have
other extraterrestrial civilizations who guide them. For instance,
Earth people have the Pleiadians. The Pleiadians have other
extraterrestrial civilizations which guide them. To make a long
story short, the two main civilizations that guide the Pleiadians
are an interdimensional group call
the DALs, and
the Andromedans.
Often when you on Earth are seeking to work through your own
transformation, you look toward the Pleiadians for assistance. The
Pleiadians, when they seek to learn, they look to their teachers,
the DALs and the Andromedans. During the education process of the
new humans in Japan by the Pleiadians, the Pleiadians called in some
of their teachers for assistance.
They called in primarily the Andromedans. So, the Andromedans were a guiding force for the
Pleiadians as the Pleiadians were teaching you. Their energy was
felt in ancient Japan as well as in other areas of Earth as well.
The Sun Goddess you mentioned has both the Andromedan and Pleiadian
connections. She was here for a short time working with the
Pleiadians who were working with the humans.
Without making it too
complex, she was Andromedan but did not come in her true form to
Earth. She radiated so much unconditional love... It was very
profound for the humans. This is why the memory of her has carried
through the mythology until today.
As far as your personal connection, we will answer that in one
sentence... You had a life as one of these Pleiadian teachers in
Japan interacting with the Andromedan energy.
That is why you feel
the connection.
Question: I would like to know if the "Immaculate Conception" really
took place, and the truth about the birth of Jesus Christ...
Very interesting story. Before we begin this, please understand that
the early history on Earth is so filled with political disputes
between the extraterrestrials, and lots of intrigue that it would
read like a good novel. It is easy to think that the
extraterrestrials are these wonderfully evolved beings who have
nothing to learn, but that is not true. Simply put, they had their
own conflicts and their own issues to learn.
So with that in mind, now we will address the birth of
Jesus.
Throughout time, before Christ's birth, there were many efforts at
combining genetics in such a way that someone would be born who
would almost be like an advanced version of Man. The birth of
Jesus was one of those genetic projects in which it was hoped a new stage
of Man would be created.
Your myths say that Mary was impregnated by an angel. In a very real
sense, that is true. But the angel was not some "heavenly creature".
It was an extraterrestrial being who was desiring to create this new
genetic version of Man. The genetics that Jesus held were a
combination of Sirian and Pleiadian. The desire of course was that
if this mixture would get into the stream of genetics on Earth,
eventually mankind would transform itself.
Most people believe this was a failure because they believe
Jesus died on the cross and therefore was not able to have any children
and spread his genetics. But at the risk of sounding blasphemous, we
will say that
he did not die on the cross, and yes, he had children.
In his life after that crucifixion, he hid and traveled to many
areas in your world. He traveled to southern Europe, India, and
Japan. We know that there are some books that speak of a place in
Northern Japan where Jesus is supposed to be buried. We would say
that in our perception it was not he who was buried here, but one of
his descendants.
So, this Immaculate Conception was another of the
many genetic projects that have gone on throughout history. Any
other aspect of that you would like to explore?
Question: In referring to
Ise Shrine, in Arabic "Ise" means Jesus
Christ. Do you have a comment on this?
We have also heard that there are areas of Japan that still have
chants or songs that are understood in Hebrew. We have also heard
that there are other words that are known that are understood in
Arabic as well.
The reason for this of course would be that there
have been migrations of people from the area of the Mediterranean
(and Northern Africa) to Japan and they brought with them earlier
versions of the Arabic and Hebrew languages.
Whether or not "Ise" means
Jesus Christ in Arabic, we cannot tell
you whether that is accurate. We have no connection with your Earth
languages other than through the channel. But it would not surprise
us if that is true because there was a migration after Jesus's
so-called crucifixion to Japan and other areas from that African
area.
They were intent on bringing the knowledge of
Jesus here as
well, even way back then. In some ways, it is very significant that
the area of Ise Shrine has moved from time to time.
This represents
the migration of Jesus. So, there is a connection between the
Middle East in Jesus' time period and Japan.
Question: There is the idea of the hundredth monkey, and some people
say that the Earth is the hundredth monkey in the galactic family.
Ahh, a planet full of monkeys, yes?
Question: Could you comment on this? What would be the effect of our
Earth's integration on some of our neighbors, like the DAL universe,
which lies adjacent to us? One more thing... Are the Andromedans
coming from a particular area of Andromeda?
Regarding the hundredth monkey idea and your planet, you've tapped
into the entire idea presented in "The Prism of Lyra". We would
agree that Earth does represent the hundredth monkey. The reason for
that is because there has been so much attention focused on Earth
for thousands of years...
At first, the attention by the
extraterrestrials was on a planet (Earth) that didn't even have life
yet. Then, once human life began on Earth, those same
extraterrestrials began incarnating here. Now, in present day, 99%
of the people on Earth are those old extraterrestrials still trying
to work out their conflicts from ancient times.
Earth has been chosen as that final ground where the integration
will take place. It will happen here because all of the souls who
are here were once that diverse group of extraterrestrials who have
now come together "under the same roof" in order to do this. Yes,
you are all connected, even with extraterrestrials as distant as the DALs, just like all the cells in your body are connected.
Think of the other civilizations in the Universe as being all part
of the same body. If one cell in your body gets cancer, all the
cells in your body have to work that much harder to heal the cancer.
If that cell that has cancer is healed, then the entire body is
healed and restored to wholeness. That is how you are so tightly
connected.
Regarding Andromeda, yes of course it is an entire galaxy unto
itself. Obviously it would then have millions of planets. But when
we refer to Andromeda, we are not referring to a specific planet or
species. We are referring to the "realm" of Andromeda. It is a
unique dimensional frequency.
In a sense, that galaxy has its own
set of rules by which it learns its own lessons. Somehow you find a
common bond or thread that ties you whereby you can learn from each
other even if it is on an abstract level.
We will give you a very brief example of what reality is like in the
Andromedan realm. In your reality, when you are walking down the
street, there is a sense of constancy, meaning that as you walk down
the street, you are always wearing the same clothes. That is
constancy.
This is a very simplified example, but if you were in the Andromedan realm it would look as follows... Imagine walking down
the street and at every moment what you are wearing is changing. The
entire scenery around you keeps changing. The rules of reality there
are very different.
But there is a realm of consciousness that
you,
the Pleiadians, and the Andromedans can meet upon. It is a very
abstract realm. We cannot really go into more depth tonight about
this.
Question: There are three significant and beautiful sites in Japan,
and when connected, they form an elongated triangle. Some people
believe that these sites were the ancient communication centers
between the extraterrestrials and the ancient Japanese. The three
sites are Miyajima Island, Matsushima, and Amanohashidate ("Heavenly
Bridge").
Would you like to comment on this?
First of all we will speak about the Heavenly Bridge
(Amanohashidate). That area is very ancient because it represents
the actual physical place where there was a space port. Many of the
extraterrestrials came and went there. Thus, a bridge between the
heaven and the earth.
That is pretty obvious, so we don't have to
explain what that means!
Miyajima has a very strong Pleiadian energy.
This was one of the
communities where some of the genetic work was done for the Asian
prototypes. It was mostly Pleiadians who were populating that area.
Also, some of the Pleiadian and Vegan spiritual teachings we were
telling you about that the Pleiadians gave to the new humans were
given in this area as well.
As a side note to tell the channel, she
was a Pleiadian at that time during the prototype education there in
Miyajima. Excuse us for giving personal information in a group, but
she often doesn't listen to us unless we are channeling to a group!
Question: As far as Matsushima in concerned, do you know if at any
time in known history the Ainu lived there? [The Ainu are Japan's
indigenous people]
Because the Ainu lived in Northern Japan, we can assume that they
lived in this area. We perceive that this site was the site of
another genetic project that was going on, which combined genetics
differently to produce the Ainu. But in all honesty, much of the
information about that place is closed to us for an unknown reason.
So, we can only assume it is not time to release it.
Does that
answer your question?
Question: Another channel told me that there was some secret hidden
in the northern part of Japan and it is not time to release it...
Yes, that is what we are sensing as well. We must always honor the
timing. If all the secrets were revealed now, the rest of your life
would be pretty boring!
Question: Does the revealing of those secrets have anything to do
with the evolution of our consciousness?
Yes. Your bodies, on the physical cellular level, are like
computers. As we told you earlier, there is a lot of knowledge about
your ancient past locked within the cells of your body.
Whenever you
get to a certain vibrational frequency, it is as if that frequency
becomes a key that unlocks more information. So, yes, timing has
everything to do with the state of consciousness.
Question: All of our souls originated from the same God-Source, but
yet it seems like the ancient extraterrestrials taught that they
were gods...
Actually, they did not teach that idea of separation. What happened
was that there was a period of time after these prototypes were
already creating communities when much of the extraterrestrial
presence left the planet. This is part of the abandonment energy.
During that time period, humans tried to emulate what they had been
taught by the extraterrestrials.
As generations passed, they lost
much of the inherent truth and began externalizing the gods. As the
humans lost touch with the truth that they were taught by the
extraterrestrials (of a spiritual universe), the idea of God was
eventually distorted to mean that the gods were outside of oneself.
We've answered this question in the context of the Pleiadians. But,
some of the other extraterrestrial groups had their own agendas.
Especially in the areas that is now the Middle East, there were some
extraterrestrial beings who instilled much fear in humans.
Unfortunately, they perpetuated the belief in God or power outside
of humans in order to keep the humans in line.
For the most part,
they were not Pleiadian. Some of them were Lyran, some of them were
Sirian. For even some of those extraterrestrials had their own
lessons to learn and had their own problems with their egos.
It is
unfortunate, but mankind is still feeling the pain from this.
Question: You mentioned that there was a ceremony which consisted of
seven steps to get close to God... Did the Pleiadians have an idea
of God since they used this ceremony?
Yes. Deep within themselves, they knew that
God was not only within
them, but all around them. They felt that it was simply a matter of
taking steps in life to raise one's consciousness to become like
God. So, they attempted to communicate this to the humans.
But often
when one is communicating very esoteric subjects that are not based
on thought but on internal sensing, it is very difficult. At that
time, they did the best they could.
Question: All of these extraterrestrial civilizations you've
mentioned are outside of the solar system... What is happening with
the consciousness within our solar system during the transformation?
First of all, there is always consciousness around any body in
space. In that sense, the sun has a consciousness. But we are
speaking about extraterrestrial civilizations who are physical like
you. Our understanding is that the consciousness around the other
planets in your solar system is non-physical, in another dimension
entirely.
In that sense, it has no genetic connection to you, though
there is a spiritual connection because those consciousnesses also
guide you.
Question: There is a symbol found in Japan which is identical to
the
symbol found in Nazca, Peru. Could you comment on this?
In ancient times, the extraterrestrial "gods" who were in higher
positions had their own symbol. Often the symbol would be worn on
the clothing of the people who served that extraterrestrial god. The
god who had that symbol that is found at Nazca (in Peru) and the
identical symbol found in Japan was a Pleiadian being.
That was his
symbol. Once the gods left the planet, the humans were often very
lonely. They always looked to the heavens for them to return. They
would often use that symbol to call the god, hoping that he would
come back. They would use it in whatever way they could, even in
small totems.
In present day, many of you have felt that Japan has a strong
connection with Peru... The connection is very ancient. One of the
reasons is because some of the same extraterrestrial gods who
interacted with you interacted with ancient Peru as well. In a
sense, when many of you go to Peru, you are also getting in touch
with the ancient Japan energy as well.
It is another way to activate
that within you.
Question: There is some strange similarity of names of sacred
places, including places in Japan... Is that a Lemurian connection?
In some cases that is true, but in others the similarity in sound is
because it is a name or title for some of the ancient gods. These
names or titles were used in many of the different cities. Often
there would be a foundation word and other words would be built
around it.
That foundation word represented the god and the addition
of other sounds to it was a recognition of territory.
Question: Could you tell us something about the true origin of the
Japanese royal family?
This may sound strange, but we are going to give you an analogy...
When you have a document that has been typed and you want to make
copies of it and distribute it, you never give away the master copy,
you only give away the copies. This way you can preserve the
original.
In ancient times, during the times when the prototypes
were created, it was important that they maintained the master
copies, so to speak. So, some of these master copies or prototypes
were kept, and their breeding was rigidly controlled. This was so
that the original genetics would not be diluted.
Obviously, you can only do this for a short period of time because
inbreeding starts happening. Then, when they started having to bring
people from the outside in to continue the line, they had to choose
those people carefully. So, the Japanese royal family now is the
current version of those ancient prototypes who were rigidly bred in
order to be kept pure.
You know that within the royal family and especially in times of
coronation there are some very secret rituals that are done. Some of
these secret rituals are based in the teachings that were given
mostly by the Pleiadians in ancient times.
Even though the royal
family has lost the memory of the prototype projects and the ancient
extraterrestrial interactions, there are parts of the memory kept
alive through myth. Some of these myths are not even known by the
general public but are kept secret within the royal family. But if
you were to know what those myths were, you would see that the
interpretation of the myths would be very similar to the story we
have told you tonight.
If you on Earth had the ability to duck underneath the chaos and go
through history, you would find that right now on the planet there
is a predominant royal line of every race.
That will tell you very
clearly that the genetic project is still continuing.
Question: Some people believe that within the Japanese royal family
there is Hebrew blood. In some of the Shinto ceremonies, there are
elements of the Jewish religion as well.
Was there any interaction
between the Japanese royal family and the ancient Hebrews?
The way we will answer this question is to tell you that
the Hebrew
connection is Sirian. And yes, there was plenty of Sirius contact
during the time of the prototypes because the Sirians were the
primary genetic engineers.
So the Sirians influenced the Hebrews,
and the Sirians influenced the Asians. So, on that level there is a
connection because the Sirians, being connected to both the Hebrews
and the Asians, influenced both of you. Also, there was migration of
Hebrews into Japan.
A predominant time of this was shortly after the
"death" of Jesus. We know for now that that answer is incomplete
and we apologize. It is much more convoluted. Perhaps that will give
you something to start your research with.
It has been a pleasure to converse with you all this night. Your
energy and your questions have been most appreciated. We have really
only given you a very small fraction of all of the things that have
gone on in your world. The most important truth that you will find
will always come from within. So, perhaps what we have shared with
you will stimulate you to find that truth within.
