# Did Turkey Just Declare War on Syria?

The Turkish Parliament has "authorized military
operations" against Syria.
For now, the government of Turkey is making a
clear distinction between "military operations" and "declaring war".
If
Turkey were to "declare war", that would likely involve Turkish troops
actually entering Syria, and the war would not be considered "won" until
certain objectives are achieved.
So by just authorizing "military operations"
against Syria, Turkey can sit back and fire off artillery rounds (and
potentially call in air strikes if necessary) without being committed to
entering Syria or attacking Damascus.
Turkey is not too keen on invading Syria by
itself anyway. Turkey would want the help of NATO in such an event, and
right now Barack Obama has made it abundantly clear to the Turkish
government that he is not going to participate in an attack on Syria before
the election.
Obama has been leading in the polls and he has
way too much to lose by starting another war. But what all of this does show
us is a couple of things.
First of all, once again we see that the Middle
East is a tinderbox that can erupt at any moment. Second of all, just the
rumors of a war between Turkey and Syria sent the price of oil absolutely
skyrocketing on Thursday. It is frightening to imagine what a real war in
the Middle East might do to the price of oil.
So what precipitated this move by Turkey? Well,
some mortar shelling that originated from inside Syria killed five people
living in a town in Turkey near the border.
The following is from a
Fox News article...
Turkey's
Parliament authorized military operations against Syria on Thursday and
its military fired on targets there for a second day after deadly
shelling from Syria killed five civilians in a Turkish border town.
For its part,
Syria admitted it was responsible for the shelling that killed five
people in Turkey and formally apologized for the deaths, a top Turkish
official said.
There are reports that the Turkish response was
actually much stronger than the mainstream news has been admitting.
According
to Debka, the Turkish military was hitting Syrian military targets with
"continuous artillery barrages"...
Constrained
from a substantial military incursion into Syria by US President Barack
Obamas veto and Saudi and Qatari refusals to help pay for it, Turkeys
government and military decided to make do with carving out a buffer
strip 10 kilometers deep into Syria by continuous artillery barrages.
Thursday
morning, Oct. 4 at 0300 GMT, Ankara ordered the Turkish army to keep up
its cross-border shelling of Syria after the first bombardment Wednesday
night in response to the deaths of five Turkish civilians and eight
injured by Syrian mortar shells which exploded in their village.
DEBKAfile's
military sources report the artillery squads were told to aim primarily
at Syrian military targets inside this strip, including bases, outposts
and Syrian forces on the move.
Several
Syrian bases and outposts have been hit so far and a large number of
Syrian soldiers killed or wounded. Neither Ankara nor Damascus is
offering information on casualties.
They have
imposed a heavy blackout on events so as to keep them under control and
avoid the risk of a full-blown war.
Many believe that this could end up being the
excuse that NATO will use to intervene in the conflict in Syria.
Since the
uprising against President Bashar Assad began, approximately
30,000 people inside Syria have been killed. It has been a very bloody
conflict.
But Syria is not alone. The Assad regime still
has plenty of friends. In fact, there have been reports that both Hezbollah
and Iran have been moving forces into position to help defend Syria.
That is one reason why it is so important to
keep a close eye on this conflict. What is starting out as a conflict
between Turkey and Syria could end up drawing in the United States, the rest
of NATO, Iran, Hezbollah and potentially even several other countries in the
Middle East.
And if war erupts in the Middle East, the price
of oil is going to go through the roof.
Just look at what happened on Thursday. The
price of oil jumped
about 3 dollars as reports of what was happening between Turkey and
Syria reached the financial markets.
So what would happen if a full-blown war in the
Middle East took place and the flow of oil was significantly disrupted? That
is a bit frightening to think about.
Sometimes we need a reminder of just how fast
things can change. For example, thanks to a couple of temporary refinery
problems in California the price of gasoline in that state is spiking and
some gas stations are actually shutting down for a while.
The average price of a gallon of gasoline in
California increased by
8.3 cents on Wednesday alone. It is now sitting at
$4.315, which is about 53 cents above the national average.
According
to Bloomberg, the refinery problems are causing gasoline shortages and
quite a few gas stations are actually shutting down their pumps for now...
Gasoline
station owners in the Los Angeles area including Costco Wholesale Corp.
(COST) are beginning to shut pumps as the states oil refiners started
rationing supplies and spot prices surged to a record.
Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO) stopped selling gasoline on the spot, or wholesale, market
in Southern California and is allocating deliveries to customers. Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) is also rationing fuel to U.S. West Coast terminal
customers.
Costcos
outlet in Simi Valley, 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Los
Angeles, ran out of regular gasoline yesterday and was selling premium
fuel at the price of regular.
And according to
Fox 5 San Diego, some gas stations are being told that there will not be
any more gasoline until mid-October...
Dave Hallak,
owner of Emerald Oil at 5600 Baltimore Drive, received a call Wednesday
morning from his gasoline supplier saying he won't be getting more
gasoline until mid-October.
My supplier
said theres no gas available in San Diego, said Hallak. He said 'all
the racks are down in Southern California and theres very tight supply,
if any.'
Of course these problems are just temporary and
things should get back to normal soon.
But what if a major war in the Middle East
disrupted the supply of gasoline for an extended period of time? Our world
is becoming increasingly unstable, and an event on the other side of the
globe can change all of our lives in an instant.
Let us hope for peace in the Middle East, but
let us also get prepared for the day when war will inevitably come.
