Mark, a
Moderator of the primary Irish TV, the RTE, is asked why this TV station
neglected its duty to inform about the Trilateral Commission Meeting in
Dublin.
The conspiracy of
the media is being shouted to the sky by the
moderator's reaction: He turns desperate!!
Summary
Suddenly, it appears that the elite behind the
New
World Order and the one-world government feel greatly annoyed by
bloggers who, unlike the MSM, that the elite control, have revealed their
conspiracy for a world government - so they are now blaming/giving credit
on/to them for the fact that we have not already long ago had their
corporate world government introduced, even calling these opponents
something as nasty as nationalistic!
Adviser to five U.S. presidents, New World Order
strategist and co-founder of the Trilateral Commission,
Zbigniew Brzezinski, in a speech to the
Council on Foreign Relations, sees two reasons for world
government not to have been created:
-
For the first time in history, the
peoples of the world have become politically awakened and aware of
the elite's conspiracy at their expense - and the peoples are
stirring! (e.g. the U.S.
Tea parties)
-
There is no longer a homogeneous
(Rothschild/Rockefeller-dominated) clique in the G20 after China and
India appeared there. But there should be a small closed group to
lead the world, says Brzezinski - and the UN with its 179 countries
are said to be unsuitable to control the world - is just their
dispatch office.
Brzezinski's brain child, the Trilateral
Commission, has just held its annual meeting in Dublin.
Here a Russian participant was mistaken about
his interlocutor and told him that they were about to decide the future
of the world and that they wanted to get rid of the cumbersome Iranian
government
through a war now. Just now there is a
report that US has started a massive military build-up opposite Iran.
Others revealed a severe frustration at their
vision of world government that they and their twins, the
Bilderberg Group, had promised each other
by 2000 not having been implemented.
Scaremongering? - Trilateral
Commission influence?

Obama starts massive US Air-Sea-Marine build-up
opposite Iran to peak around 1 August. Debkafile's military sources disclose
that the 6,000 Marines and sailors aboard the Truman Strike Group come from
four months of extensive and thorough training to prepare them for
anticipated missions in the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean.

The US is planning to upgrade its surveillance
airbase in southwestern Afghanistan just 20 miles from Irans border, which
will likely rile the Islamic regime, as will upgrading of forces of Saudi
Arabia and the UAE.
Many blogs have been dealing with the corporative, corrupt New World Order's
one-world government under development. Personally, I have been thinking all
along: Our protests and information is of no avail, since people don't care
and just follow their leaders as sheeples - and that the elitists know that.
However, as appears from the following, this is not the case.
More and more people are awakening - and the blogosphere has apparently sent the message which the elitist
controlled MSM
media (above video) owned by the elite has so carefully kept secret to us:
That the
ongoing conspiracy for an elitist world government is not theory - but
practice as stated by Barroso, Sarkozy, Gordon Brown etc (videos on right
margin of this blog), by ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet, and WTO chief Pascal
Lamy, Angela Merkel etc., that according to EU President van Rompuy, 2009
was the first year of
global governance.
The diversification - not least due to China's
and India's roles in the G20 and the global political knowledge and
awakening as for the plans of the elitist conspirators mean that the
relatively small clique of banksters and their political minions in the US
and EU are being hampered in developing their corporative and Communist and
here, world government.
However: The mankind's ancient fiend is not only desperate
- he is cornered,
a position where beasts are always most dangerous.

At a recent Council on Foreign Relations speech
in Montreal, co-founder with
David Rockefeller of the Trilateral
Commission and regular Bilderberg attendee Zbigniew Brzezinski warned that a
global political awakening, in combination with infighting amongst the
elite, was threatening to derail the move towards a one world government.
See this video:
Brzezinski explained that global political
leadership had become,
much more diversified unlike what it was
until relatively recently, noting the rise of China as a geopolitical
power, and that global leadership in the context of the G20 was,
lacking internal unity with many of its members in bilateral
antagonisms.
In other words, the global elite is infighting
amongst itself and this is hampering efforts to rescue the agenda for global
government, which seems to be failing on almost every front.
Brzezinski then explained another significant factor in that,
For the first time in all of human history
mankind is politically awakened - thats a total new reality - it has
not been so for most of human history.
Brzezinski continued,
The whole world has become politically
awakened, adding that all over the world people were aware of what was
happening politically and were consciously aware of global inequities,
inequalities, lack of respect, exploitation - and stirring.
Zbigniew Brzezinski
founder
of the Trilateral Commission
He added that this in combination with a
fractured elite,
makes it a much more difficult context for
any major power, including currently the leading world power, the United
States.
During a subsequent question and answer session,
Brzezinski was asked if he thought another organization should replace
the
United Nations as the de facto,
one world government, to which Brzezinski
responded, There should be such an organization, before pointing out
that the UN with its 179 was not the world government - but should be
entrusted with the administration of subordinate service tasks.
As the text at the end of the video makes clear,
Brzezinskis admission that humanity has undergone a political awakening is
not a positive development in the eyes of the elite.
In his 1970 book
Between Two Ages - America's
Role in the Technetronic Era, Brzezinski wrote the following:
The technetronic era involves the gradual
appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be
dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will
be possible to assert almost Tea-party continuous surveillance over
every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the
most personal information about the citizen. These files will be subject
to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities.
US Tea Parties against taxations and bank
bail-outs is one expression of awakening awareness of elitist exploitation
which has made an impression on the global elite.
The elite to which Brzezinski refers included many of those who were in
attendance for his speech at the CFR meeting.
The global political awakening
which Brzezinski discussed represents part of the resistance to that very
elite dominated society and the
systems of control, subjugation and
surveillance that they have imposed upon the human race in pursuit of a
more controlled society and a one world government.

Trilateral Commission (TC)
members, angry over their failure to establish a world government and to
exploit the economic crisis they generated, called for war with Iran when
they gathered behind closed doors here in Dublin, Ireland May 7-10.
War plans were revealed by Mikhail Slobodovsici, a chief adviser to
the Russian leadership, when he strolled off the grounds of the Four Seasons
resort, where TC had hunkered down behind armed guards and locked doors. He
thought he was talking to a TC colleague when speaking with Alan Keenan,
who operates the web site
WeAreChange.org.
Slobodovsici said.
We need a world government, he said, but,
referring to Iran, said we need to get rid of them.
Suddenly, Slobodovsici noticed that Keenans
nametag was different from the TC label and said:
I cant talk - we operate under
Chatham
House rule."
David Rockefeller
Founder of the
Trilateral
Commission, the
Bilderberg Group,
the
Club of Rome and former
President of the
Council on Foreign Relations
Never have the illustrious members of the TC
been so depressed.
It gets worse every year, not better, one
said. Why do we even bother to meet anymore?
We cant simply give up and quit, another
responded. Bilderberg expects us to have a plan outlined.
Much of their distress is due to the failure to establish a world government.
In the 1990s, both TC and
Bilderberg confidently predicted they would
obtain a world government by the year 2000. A decade later, their goal is
even further away. TC boys are upset they were unable to exploit the
economic crisis they helped generate by creating a world
treasury department under the UN.
They blame rising nationalism opposing to
surrender sovereignty to international bodies, and ask how those people
knew about this, according to witnesses inside the TC hotel.
Still, the TC is charging ahead. Bilderberg will
meet June 4 to June 7 in Sitges, Spain, a resort city about 20 miles from
Barcelona to make final decisions on what to impose upon the world.
The TC is the junior varsity, with slightly more than 300 participants.
Bilderberg, the senior group in the wannabe secret world government,
has slightly more than 100. The two groups have an interlocking leadership
and common goal of a world government under their control. Still, the TC
attracts heads of state and other high officials in Europe and international
financiers, including
David Rockefeller and members of the
Rothschild family.
High officials of the
Obama administration from
the White House and departments of Treasury, State and Commerce will attend.
