This Awareness wishes entities to understand that there are three
major players in the galaxy:
The Orion Empire as that which
is ruled basically by one leader, as presented fictionally in the
story of Star Wars.
The Reptoid Federation as that which is a
conglomeration of many different groups, in which the Reptoids in
various types of species have joined together and the Galactic
Confederation as that which is made up from federations of different
star systems throughout the galaxy, these being mostly of the human
types.
In some cases the serpent, what is termed the serpent race, will be
involved. This Awareness indicates the serpent race as that which
was a subspecies from Draco, which broke away many eons ago, and has
been aligned with the Galactic Confederation for some time.
Their
main home, as far as human knowledge is concerned, would be that of
Sirius. There are many other places where these entities reside, but
these do not have names and are not reference points of which humans
are capable of understanding.
(...)
Now these Reptoids are laying claim to the Earth as being theirs,
using their mercenaries, the Greys, as forerunners to that claim,
and the Galactic Confederation as that which is at a loss in terms
of what to do because the governments of the world have accepted
agreements with these mercenary forerunners, the Greys, giving them
treaties to be on Earth, and to conduct their activities.
Without
such treaties, the Greys would have broken galactic law and could be
removed. With such treaties, they have the right to take over the
planet so long as they abide by those treaties that were given in
secret by the leaders of these various countries.
The dilemma, of course, is that people of Earth were not party to
these agreements. Only a certain small group of leaders were party
to the agreement. It is obvious that the
Galactic Confederation has
its hands tied by ethical and legal standards and can do nothing
unless the people demand of their leaders the right to be party to
any agreements that gives away their world, their lives, their
rights.
This Awareness indicates that if the people do not know their world,
their rights and their lives have been bartered away, then they have
no say in the matter. This Awareness indicates that this is the
reason why entities who are hoping for outside intervention, must
wonder whether the intervention will ever come.
There is a great
dilemma among those concerned about the situation on Earth, a great
dilemma as to whether the Galactic Confederation should intervene
without invitation from the leaders when the leaders have been
elected by the people or when the leaders have a position that is
held in place by the people whom they represent.
This Awareness indicates that this is the situation and the question
and the dilemma that causes great concern in regard to whether Earth
should or should not be raptured, for only when enough people cry
out will it appear there is justification, morally and legally for
the Galactic Confederation to intervene in Earth's affairs.
Transmission from September 19, 1992
This Awareness indicates that there are seen three elements in the
galaxy that works as units. There is that which is called "The
Empire", and that is controlled by Orion. This Awareness wishes to
make some clarification in this respect; that the majority of those
known in Orion are of a negative nature, but that there are some
planets and sectors of Orion that are positive in nature.
Clarion is a planetary system, a star and planetary system that is
of a positive nature. Betelgeuse and some of those stars in that
general area are filled with planets that are of a negative nature.
This Awareness indicates that there are some hundred and thirty
planets in that area.
This Awareness indicates that there is also, besides the Orion
Empire, the Draconian Federation. It is not a confederation, but a
federation. The Draconians have absorbed those from Zeta Reticuli
and have brought these entities into the Federation as mercenaries,
but the Reticuli do not think of themselves so much as part of the
Federation, they refer to themselves more as a network. The word "Reticuli"
means network, and that is a traditional classification in their
history, which they do not easily shed.
This Awareness indicates however, the Draconian Federation considers
the Network as part of the Federation, surbordinate to their own
controls. The Draconians are able to control the Reticuli through
treaties that have been formed some five hundred thousand years
back, when they helped to rescue the Reticuli from their dying
planet and infused it with new life, and then, in return, gained
control over the entities of the Reticuli.
The Reticuli hail from a binary star, that is, two stars that rotate
together, and live on planets close to these two stars which are
highly unlivable to humans, being very heavy in heat and desert.
This Awareness indicates that thus, the Reticuli, in coming to
Earth, prefer desert areas where the climate is quite warm.
This Awareness indicates that as for the so-called
Intergalactic
Command or Intergalactic Confederation, this may be thought of more
as a grouping or alliance of highly evolved spiritual beings of
different star systems who have united in their common purpose of
hindering the Orion Empire and Draconian Federation from capturing
and enslaving other planets outside their own already held
federations and empires.
This Awareness indicates that those from
Vega have pledged their
efforts to help prevent the Empire and the Federation from taking
control of Earth.
Their methods are not to interfere directly in the
affairs of humans without invitation from humans, and the humans
have allowed the Draconians and Orion Empire representatives to have
their bases on Earth, therefore, the Vegans, Lyrans and
Pleiadians
must honor, by their own rules and principles, the human decision
and treaties with the Draconians and Orion Empire and Reticuli
Network to have positions on Earth, until the humans choose
otherwise.
In the meantime, the Vegans, those from Lyra and those from the
Pleiades have chosen other ways to influence the human movement
toward throwing off these would-be oppressors. The Vegans send some
of their most advanced beings to be born on Earth with earthly
parents and to grow and develop and do their work to help prevent
this takeover of the planet by these Empire, Federation and Network
aliens.
This Awareness indicates the Pleiadians also have their volunteers.
There have been those who came in spaceships and met directly with
individuals who were open and desirous of meeting with them. These
entities even gave warning about the Orion Empire and sought to
prevent the treaties, but failed to do so.
Therefore, while they seek to help in whatever ways they can to
hinder the Orion Empire in its conquest or the Draconians in their
various invasion plans, they avoid direct interference in the
affairs pertaining to these entities on Earth. This Awareness
indicates that they are even careful not to talk about these
entities as being dangerous or enemies of theirs or of mankind.
This Awareness indicates those from Lyra also incarnate into human
form to help change the vibrations and instill a sense of spiritual
meaning into the lives of those whom they come in contact with. This
Awareness indicates that these are ways whereby the amalgamation of
star systems work together to help Earth in its struggle for
survival and for spiritual enlightenment.
This Awareness indicate that entities may continue to refer to these
of the amalgamated planetary systems as the Galactic Confederation,
if they understand that it is not simply a bunch of space people
flying around with fancy names spouting spiritual marshmallow words
that sound sweet but have no substance or meaning other than to
massage the libidos of humans and make them feel comfortable and
special.
This Awareness indicates that this kind of spiritual marshmallowing
is not in the will of this Awareness, but rather, stagnates the
human soul and its growth and evolution. It keeps the human soul
from facing reality and growing to become the best it can be. This
Awareness suggest that it is better for entities to learn what they
can learn, regardless of whether it is tasty, sweet marshmallow-like
and pleasant, or whether it is shocking, disturbing and yet
informative.
Question: T.H. in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, asks if Awareness can give
an update on the war between the Reptoids and the Pleiadians. (This
was back in 1992)
A:
This Awareness indicates that this appears to still be in levels of
great conflict; that the Draconians approximately 10 years ago
launched a direct invasion into the Pleiadian star system, attacking
several of the planets that were inhabited and have wreaked much
havoc on those planets, nearly destroying the civilizations thereon.
They still hold some of the territory on those planets, even to this
day. The Pleiadians were forced to turn their attention to
liberating those planets, and during the past decade have worked
hard and suffered much in this effort. This Awareness indicates that
the Pleiadians, having new starships, have been able to push back
the invaders, partly because their own supply lines were near at
hand while the invaders were far from their own home and had to
reply on supplies that were captured and had little support from
anyone outside their own group.
This invasion force from Draco was quite large. It appears that they
are now quite diminished, and it is unlikely that they will survive
another year in this war. It is more likely that they will retreat
back to Draco before being destroyed.
This Awareness indicates that the
Pleiadians have rallied together
during this time and have become much closer in terms of their
interplanetary amalgamation and have strengthened their forces so as
to be actually stronger at this time than when the war or invasion
began, approximately 10 years ago.
Question: T.H. also asks: "Awareness previously stated that the
Reptoids, Greys and the Pleiadians were both presenting their case
as to which of them has a rightful claim to the Earth and its
inhabitants to a council of various other races of
extraterrestrials. Has any decision been reached by this council,
and if so, what are the ramifications of this decision for all of us
here on the Earth?"
A:
This Awareness indicates that it appears there has been a kind of
recognition that as long as Earth allows the Draconians and
Reticulans to remain and treaties have been signed, that this more
or less creates a block to prevent interference from the Pleiadians,
Vegans or others.
It is for this reason that any contacts will be of a very minor
nature, more to educate and inform than to directly interfere or
confront the Draconian, Riticulan and Orion Empire Greys.
This Awareness indicates that the
Andromedan Council is much like
the United Nations on Earth; it has certain influence, but has no
power over those who refuse to abide by its recommendations. The
Draconian Federation, the Orion Empire; these do not give much
credence to the Andromedan Council or its recommendations.
They appeal to it when they see a chance to benefit or to use it to
their advantage, but ignore it when it does not give them advantage.
Therefore, at this time, anything given by the Andromedan Council in
regard to the Earth has been generally ignored by these entities.
Transmission from September 10, 1993
This Awareness indicates
the New World Order is part of the alien
agenda, promoted by those Greys from Orion. The purpose being to set
up the world for its future inclusion in the Orion Empire.
This Awareness indicates that while this is planned, it is not seen
as the only option or alternative. It is seen that the Galactic
Confederation, which includes the Pleiadians and the Vegans and the
Sirius groups, are all also concerned and hoping that the Earth does
not become part of the Orion Empire, or the Draco Federation. This
Awareness indicates that they prefer to see the Earth become part of
the Galactic Confederation.
This Awareness indicates that the Earth is in a particular position
in the galaxy and has a special value in regard to the water on the
Earth as well as that central core computer that was placed under
the Earth's surface by Orion overseers from the past, when they in
ancient times had great control over this planet, and they wish to
restart that computer, and reclaim the planet as their own in their
network.
This Awareness indicates that there have been a number of
extraterrestrial cultures who have, in the past, made claim to the
planet and who have either abandoned those claims and gone
elsewhere, or who have lost control of their property through war or
other conflicts, so that at present time there are disputes among
these extraterrestrial cultures as to who really owns the Earth.
This Awareness indicates that it is not clearly defined, even though
there are certain cultures that would have entities believe that
they are the true owners of the Earth;
the Reptoids date a claim
back some ten thousand years; the Sirius groups claim to have taken
control from the Reptoids and
the Pleiadians claim spiritual
connection with humanity. The Vegans see the Earth as not theirs but
as an ally to which they wish to assist and join the struggle
against tyrannies from other extraterrestrial cultures.
This Awareness indicates the
Orion Greys, the tall big-nosed Greys,
are those who claim some kind of ownership based on their having
placed a computer in the subterranean levels of Earth which has
guided energies on the Earth through grid-lines and through certain
forces that were used through these grid-lines and through their
economic controls that have been handed down over the hundreds and
thousands of years since that time, up till the present.
The
Orion Greys appear to be in a position of economic power,
wherein they are more powerful economically, and thus hold control
over other extraterrestrials, such as the Draconians and the Zeta
Reticulans. This Awareness indicates the small Greys or those of the
Zeta Reticuli are basically mercenaries under the domination of the
Draconians, the Draco Reptiles, which are subservient to the Orion
Greys, even though they have greater military power and greater
force.
The Draconian forces have the ability to take control away from the
Orion Greys, but the Orion Greys are such good managers of planets
that the Draco Reptoids do not envy them of their job and therefore,
let themselves be the military arm of the operation, while giving
the economic and political control to the Orion forces.
This Awareness indicates this essentially is the synopsis of what is
occurring in the overall picture of the dispute over Earth. Humanity
in the meantime is semi-oblivious to all of this and simply goes
along on their daily pursuit of pleasure/pain behavioral lifestyles.
This Awareness indicates that there are a very few people in the
human population who understand much about the overall picture in
regard to the alien presence on Earth or the agenda of the alien
presence and its overall intent.
This Awareness indicates the
Galactic Command, composed of the Pleiadians, Vegans,
Sirius and Arcturans, is such that it keeps a
low profile, because they have not been clearly invited by all of
human representatives and governments to assist humans in throwing
off the yoke of oppression that will come from these Draconians and
Orion forces.
In fact, most humans do not yet recognize this
potential for enslavement by these forces, and therefore are more
concerned about what kind of health and technology these forces may
give them in terms of enhancing their own particular power over
others on Earth.
Those involved in these higher levels wherein there is communication
with the aliens, are more concerned with what they are going to get
out of the situation as individual humans than they are by what the
agenda has in store for the rest of humanity.
The Galactic Command simply waits with its plans and abilities and
forces until the time is right for it to move in order to help
humanity, if indeed humanity does seek help.
This Awareness indicates that
the recent death of Creston, also
known as Ron Rummell, is that which has been a turning point in
regard to the Galactic Command and its understanding of the human
condition, for this entity was not sent here simply to alert
humanity of the presence and threat of the Greys and Reptoids which
he assumed was his reason for being here.
The entity also was here
to find out, for the Vegans and Arcturans and others, why it is that
the humans could not stand up to the dark forces in regard to the
money system and the controls and power of those operating for the
dark forces on Earth.
The entity having lived with very little
income and having to depend on help from friends to keep his
research going, had a very clear knowledge and understanding of the
difficulties of living on Earth when controlled by the money system.
It was not until the last few years that he realized the money
system was essentially controlled and placed on Earth by the Orion
forces, and that it was a form of control over the masses of this
Earth plane, and it was not until the last few years that he
realized this control had great power in keeping entities afraid,
for they would be fearful of losing their jobs if they began to
speak of UFOs or of aliens while at work.
This Awareness indicates that the control of money was even able to
determine whether entities in higher places could speak out with
knowledge they had learned, could alert the masses, for in all cases
if anyone bucked the system, they would lose their job and have no
money and without money, they would lose their home and quite likely
lose their family and it would become a downward spiral towards
total isolation and despair.
This Awareness indicates that when this entity was killed and moved
back into contact with his Vegan friends and fellow associates, the
first thing they sought from him was information on what his
situation was like. Why was it so hard to do anything? Why couldn't
he do more, when he knew what was going on? And his information was:
"I had no money!"
To them this was total puzzlement, for they do not
use money on that planet in the Vegan constellation. The Pleiadians
likewise, do not let themselves become controlled by a money system,
nor do the entities from Sirius, nor do the Arcturans.
It is only those entities who are subject to the Orion influences
who must rely and serve the money system. This Awareness indicates
that the entity Creston, which was his Vegan name, also known as Ron Rummell, which was his earthly name, gave the Vegans and Arcturans
and Pleiadians the information which they needed in order to
understand why Earth people have such a problem in throwing off the
yoke of oppression.
With this new information, they now have an understanding that they
may have to be more direct in their interference; that they may not
necessarily have to follow the so-called "Prime Directive" of
avoiding any influence on a culture unless invited. This Awareness
indicates that they realize now that an invitation by the subjugated
masses may not be possible because of the way the money system
controls everything.
This Awareness indicates in other words, in
the killing of Ron Rummell, or Creston, the alien forces may have sealed their own end,
their own demise, in regard to the Galactic Command, which after
re-evaluating its position, and its status in regard to human
affairs now has reason to become more assertive, knowing that
humanity is likened unto the prisoner who cannot call for help
because they have been muzzled and made speechless.
This Awareness indicates that the future will determine whether this
has been the undoing of the dark forces, or has contributed to their
undoing, or whether it has helped them as they anticipated in
ridding the planet of this entity, but this Awareness suggests it
has backfired on them and will create repercussions against them
that will be felt hard and heavy in the coming years, as they
attempt to complete their takeover of this planet.
Transmission from February 23, 1991
There were many who were sent here to this planet by the
Galactic
Confederation to help warn the masses. There are few who recall
their purposes for being on this planet. This Awareness indicates
that the Galactic Confederation by its own policies is not allowed
to intervene in the affairs of a planet without being invited, and
the Earth leaders have not yet invited the Galactic Confederation.
Instead, they have invited the aliens from Draco and the Greys, and
therefore, the Galactic Confederation has a kind of 'hands off'
policy.
This is a unique situation because the invasion of Earth is taking
place with the approval of its leaders, but with the deception of
the masses, wherein the masses are not being told the full truth of
the situation.
Therefore, because of this duplicity and deception,
those of the Galactic Confederation have found that the best way to
assist without violating the galactic code or law is to let some of
their own people be incarnated on Earth and become earthlings with
the hope that they will recall who they are and will be able to warn
entities of the nature of these particular aliens.
(...)
This Awareness indicates that the Reptoid people do not necessarily
appear as Reptoids when they reincarnate as human beings. They are
simply humans in appearance, from human parents, but they have
within their soul and background Reptoid genes and memory and are
essentially from Draco in their origins, and there are many on this
Earth who are Draconian in nature and their purpose is to gain power
and destroy anything that preaches or attempts to establish a great
harmony on Earth.
This Awareness indicate that this may be seen as
related to the Hindu god Kali, the Destroyer. This Awareness
indicates that it should be recognized that the Draconian factor as
that which is more destructive and the so-called Serpent or Sirius
factor as that which has been attempting to create greater harmony
on the Earth.
This Awareness indicates the Pleiadians as being
distant cousins of humans, and they also being benefactors.
Transmission from November 10, 1990
This Awareness indicates that in the sense wherein entities ask:
"What can we do about this situation?", there is very little that
individuals can do in situations such as yours other than to become
aware and to share what you are aware of with others.
If by chance a
great awakening occurs, even if it takes several years for the
masses to awaken, the chances of the aliens being able to subdue
humanity decreases in direct proportion to the awareness of humanity
regarding the alien agenda and purpose.
Thus, by becoming aware and helping to make others aware, each
entity can do his or her part. When you consider that it was only
about a year ago that the entity William Cooper began to give forth
information in regard to the Zeta Reticuli and some of these alien
intrigues, there has been a great awakening already. If that
awakening is only one percent of the population, imagine what it
will be within another year, if that one percent goes out to awaken
others.
If one person can spread the word to awaken one percent of the
population, how many can one percent awaken within a year?
This
Awareness indicates that this is essentially the most important
thing that entities can do at this time, to awaken the masses to the
information that they are receiving in regard to the aliens, in
regard to the agenda of these aliens, and the plan to take control
of Earth and to set up the New World Order for alien influence to
operate through, none of which would be healthy for your
grandchildren or your future generations...
