# The Hidden Evil - 13

The Great Depression was Deliberately Created
Apparently congress was aware of the scheme of the international bankers and
recognized the danger that the republic was in.
Congressman Lindberg said in a Congressional
Record dated, December 22, 1913, vol. 51,
"This new law [the Federal Reserve Act] will
create inflation whenever the trusts want inflation. It may not do so
immediately, but... if the trusts can get another period of inflation,
they figure they can unload the stocks on the people at high prices
during the excitement and them bring on a panic and buy them back at low
prices... The people may not know it immediately, but the day of
reckoning is only a few years removed."
"That day of reckoning, of course, came in 1929," said Perloff, "and the
Federal Reserve has since created an endless series of booms and busts
by the strategic tightening and relaxation of money and credit."
Speaking about the historical disinformation
regarding the crash, Perloff said,
"Establishment historians present the '29
stock market crash as they do most events: an accident, evolved from
erroneous policies, not from deliberate planning. We have all heard how
foolish speculation bid stock prices high, but that the bubble finally
burst, plunging brokers out of windows and America into the Depression."
"Having built the Federal Reserve as a tool to consolidate and control
wealth, the international bankers were now ready to make a major
killing," stated Allen.
"Between 1923 and 1929," he described, "the
Federal Reserve expanded (inflated) the money supply by sixty-two
percent. Much of this new money was used to bid the stock market up to
dizzying heights. At the same time that enormous amounts of credit money
were being made available."
Continued Allen,
"the mass media began to ballyhoo tales of
instant riches to be made in the stock market. According to Ferdinand
Lundberg: 'For profits to be made on these funds the public had to be
induced to speculate, and it was so induced by misleading newspaper
accounts, many of them bought and paid for by the brokers that operated
the pools.'"
Perloff concurred, writing,
"The Federal Reserve prompted the
speculation by expanding the money supply a whopping sixty-two percent
between 1923 and 1929. When the central bank became law in 1913,
Congressman Charles Lindbergh had warned: 'From now on, depressions will
be scientifically created.' Like two con men working a mark, the Fed
made credit easy while Establishment newspapers hyped what riches could
be made in the stock market."
"Curtis Dall," he continued, "himself a
syndicate manager for Lehman Brothers was on the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange on the day of the Crash."
Perloff quotes Dall as declaring,
"Actually, it was the calculated 'shearing'
of the public by the World-Money powers triggered by the planned sudden
shortage of call money in the New York money market."
The "shearing," wrote Allen, caused a,
"despair [which] produced a willingness to
accept a major expansion of government controls over the economy... In
1929, America was a long way from total government."
He advised,
"The next depression will be used as the
excuse for complete socialist-fascist controls at home and the creation
of a World Superstate internationally."
Congressman Louis McFadden, Chairman of the
House Banking Committee, declared of the Depression,
"It was not accidental. It was a carefully
contrived occurrence."
He warned,
"The international bankers sought to bring
about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of
us all."
The Great Depression is another example of the
Problem-Reaction-Solution formula.
"Plummeting stock prices ruined small
investors, but not the top "insiders" on Wall Street," wrote Perloff.
"Paul Warburg had issued a tip in March of
1929 that the crash was coming. Before it did, John D. Rockefeller,
Bernard Baruch, Joseph P. Kennedy, and other money barons got out of the
market... Early withdrawal from the market not only preserved the
fortunes of these men," said Perloff, "it also enabled them to return
later and buy up whole companies for a song."
"History shows that the Wall Street biggies came through very well
indeed," wrote Alan B. Jones in his book, How the World Really Works.
Quoting from G. Edward Griffin's book, The
Creature from Jekyll Island, he added,
"Virtually all of the inner club was
rescued. There is no record of any member of the interlocking
directorate between the Federal Reserve, the major New York banks, and
their prime customers having been caught by surprise."

Bread Line
Jones quotes Herbert Hoover's
description of the Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon's views,
"Mr. Mellon had only one formula: 'Liquidate
labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, [and] liquidate real
estate.'" [Mellon] said, "It will purge the rottenness out of the
system. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick up
the wrecks from less competent people."
"For those who knew the score," stated Allen, "a comment by Paul Warburg
had provided the warning to sell. That signal came on March 9, 1929,
when the Financial Chronicle quoted Warburg as giving this sound advice:
'If orgies of unrestricted speculation are permitted to spread too
far... the ultimate collapse is certain... to bring about a general
depression involving the whole country.'"
"Sharpies [insiders] were later able to buy
back these stocks at a ninety percent discount from their former highs,"
he declared.
"FDR is probably best remembered for the New Deal," stated Perloff.
"Of courser, since a large portion of the
work force was unemployed, there was not enough tax revenue to pay for
these programs. So the government turned to its other source -
borrowing. In effect, the international bankers, having created the
Depression, now loaned America the cash to recover from it."
He added,
"Naturally, the interest on these loans
would be borne on the backs of taxpayers for years to come."
Migration
The migration of families & individuals due to lack of jobs was evidently
common during the Great Depression.
Encyclopedia Britannica describes the Great
Depression as the,
"Longest and most severe economic depression
ever experienced," which "precipitated economic failures around the
world" and triggered "major changes in the structure of the U.S.
economy."
"To think that the scientifically engineered
Crash of '29 was an accident or the result of stupidity defies all
logic," concluded Allen.
Summary
This evidence suggests that The Great Depression was artificially created so
the larger Wall Street firms, which control the stock market, could
eliminate competition and make profits out of lending America money to
recover from it.
"Competition is a sin."
-John D. Rockefeller
