# Secret Military Training Blurs Line Between Police and Soldiers

As the military transitions into a
tech-heavy force, increasingly reliant on robots and drones, local
police forces are looking less like law enforcement and more like
heavily armored combat units. Now, it seems they are starting to train
like them, as well.
A story published by
The State newspaper in Columbia, South Carolina,
reported on recent
secret joint training missions between
U.S. Army special forces and the Richland County (South Carolina)
Sheriff's Department.
The article describes training exercises
being conducted by "unidentified units" from Ft. Bragg, North Carolina.
Ft. Bragg is the home of the elite U.S. Army Special Operations Command
(USASOC)
and the super-secret, super-deadly Delta Force.
A spokesman for the Richland County
Sheriff's Department refused to identify who was participating in the
exercise or why it was being carried out. The department did, however,
issue a press release,
warning that the war games could get loud.
"Citizens may see military and
departmental vehicles traveling in and around rural and metropolitan
areas and may hear ordnance being set off or fired which will be
simulated/blanks and controlled by trained personnel," it declared.
As for why such combat simulations were
necessary, the statement explained that they were a result of,
"Sheriff Leon Lott's longstanding
commitment to making sure that deputies are trained and prepared for
every event and potential threat and his desire to assist the
military to ensure their preparations."
This synthesis of police and military is a
threat to both civil liberty and a clear distinction between the
purposes of the two organizations. The integration has progressed so
far, though, that even the mainstream press is taking notice.
In
an essay published in the Wall
Street Journal last August Radley Balko, author of the
Rise of the Warrior Cop, presented
chilling and convincing evidence of the blurring of the line between cop
and soldier:
Driven by martial rhetoric and the
availability of military-style equipment - from bayonets and M-16 rifles
to armored personnel carriers - American police forces have often
adopted a mind-set previously reserved for the battlefield.
The war on drugs and, more recently,
post-9/11 antiterrorism efforts have created a new figure on the U.S.
scene: the warrior cop - armed to the teeth, ready to deal harshly with
targeted wrongdoers, and a growing threat to familiar American
liberties.
Balko rightly connects the menace of the
martial police with the decline in liberty and a disintegration of legal
boundaries between sheriffs and generals:
Americans have long been wary of using the
military for domestic policing. Concerns about potential abuse date back
to the creation of the Constitution, when the founders worried about
standing armies and the intimidation of the people at large by an
overzealous executive, who might choose to follow the unhappy precedents
set by Europe's emperors and monarchs.
Given the critical role played by sheriffs
in the protection of constitutionally guaranteed liberty, it is
dismaying to read story after story describing the anxious acceptance -
and occasionally the full-time petitioning - of military materiel by
county lawmen.
It's not just the conversion from cop to "warfighter"
that is changing the landscape of law enforcement in America, however.
As The New American has chronicled, the Department of Homeland
Security
has their hooks in the precinct and
sheriff's department, as well.
Even the Richland County Sheriff's
Department's own website helps explain to citizens its "critical role"
in
preventing 'terrorist' attacks:
As we are often reminded by events across
America and around the world, disaster can strike at any time.
Terrorism in its many forms, weather and
other natural disasters, and accidental emergencies are regularly
highlighted in the news. Public safety and emergency response agencies
on the local, state, and federal levels are working to prevent and
prepare for all types of catastrophes, but there is more that can be
done.
Citizens have a critical role in partnering
with public officials to help families, neighborhoods, and entire
communities be better prepared.
There is little debate that the "Knowledge
is power" adage is true. Also, we know that panic is caused primarily by
fear. If citizens remain informed and educated about the dangers we face
in today's world, this knowledge can translate into a powerful means of
reducing panic in the face of tragedy.
The tragedy, it seems, is not the threat of
a terrorist attack, but the nearly constant assault by police on the
fundamental rights of citizens, an attack made more deadly by the use of
military-grade weapons, vehicles, and tactics.
Maybe all the money and materiel flowing
from the feds to local police is to prepare the latter to quell popular
uprisings that result from the continued eradication by the former of
freedom and individual liberty. One expert thinks that may be the case.
Jim Fitzgerald worked for eight years
as a vice and narcotics squad detective in Newark, New Jersey, before
joining the staff of The John Birch Society. He is point man for the
conservative organization's "Support
Your Local Police" initiative.
In an interview with
The New American, Fitzgerald said there is "virtually no use" for
the military-grade equipment being bought by local law enforcement with
DHS grant money.
"The only reason to have this equipment
is to use it," he said, and it is likely it would be used against
local citizens who have risen up and created some sort of civil
disorder.
DHS, Fitzgerald believes, may be
anticipating these riots and looks to them as a justification for the
militarization of the police.
"They [DHS grants] are not good, not
healthy, and not constitutional," Fitzgerald added.
Balko agrees.
In his Wall
Street Journal piece he reports:
In my own research, I have collected over 50
examples in which innocent people were killed in raids to enforce
warrants for crimes that are either nonviolent or consensual (that is,
crimes such as drug use or gambling, in which all parties participate
voluntarily).
These victims were bystanders, or the police
later found no evidence of the crime for which the victim was being
investigated.
They include,
-
Katherine Johnston, a 92-year-old
woman killed by an Atlanta narcotics team acting on a bad tip
from an informant in 2006
-
Alberto Sepulveda, an 11-year-old
accidentally shot by a California SWAT officer during a 2000
drug raid
-
Eurie Stamps, killed in a 2011 raid
on his home in Framingham, Mass., when an officer says his gun
mistakenly discharged. Mr. Stamps wasn't a suspect in the
investigation
What would it take to dial back such
excessive police measures?
The obvious place to start would be ending
the federal grants that encourage police forces to acquire gear that is
more appropriate for the battlefield. Beyond that, it is crucial to
change the culture of militarization in American law enforcement.
One organization is working to bring about
that change and to help local law enforcement return to their
traditional role as guardians of constitutional liberty.
The Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace
Officers Association (CSPOA) recognizes the invaluable role of
sheriffs in preserving, protecting, and defending the Constitution in
the counties.
Their mission statement establishes the
group's noble goals:
This is our plan, our goal and our quest.
We are forming the Constitutional Peace
Officers Association which will unite all public servants and sheriffs,
to keep their word to uphold, defend, protect, preserve, and obey the
Constitutions of the United States of America.
We already have hundreds of police,
sheriffs, and other officials who have expressed a desire to be a part
of this Holy Cause of Liberty.
We are going to train and vet them all,
state by state, to understand and enforce the constitutionally protected
Rights of the people they serve, with an emphasis on State Sovereignty
and local autonomy.
Then these local governments will issue our
new Declaration to the Federal Government regarding the abuses that we
will no longer tolerate or accept. Said declaration will be enforced by
our Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers. In short, the CSPOA will
be the army to set our nation free.
This will guarantee this movement remains
both peaceful and effective.
If the military and law enforcement continue
conducting secret (no media were allowed to participate in or observe
the training in Richland County) combat simulations in towns and
counties, if police and sheriffs continue devoting time and resources in
requesting millions of dollars in grants from the DHS, then the
separation between the roles of these organizations will disappear and
so will constitutionally protected liberty.
