Let the numbers tell the story.
The following presents a detailed summary
and analysis of Afghan civilians killed directly - so-called impact deaths -
by U.S/NATO forces in Afghanistan during a single month, February 2010. The
Obama killing machine left 80-86 dead Afghan and Pashtun civilians.
By
contrast, the number in February 2009 was 50.
The intent here is to set the
record straight as regards Afghans killed by the U.S/NATO, and in so doing
challenge the UNAMA to move beyond its faith-based counting. Regrettably,
data put out by the UNAMA gets widely cited less for its validity (which
cannot be fact-checked given the organizations refusal to publish
disaggregated data) and more because of a vague public yearning to believe
(have faith in) in the U.Ns alleged impartiality and credibility.
As I have
repeatedly demonstrated, the UNAMA data barely captures one-half of the
Afghan civilians killed by U.S/NATO direct actions and by so doing serves
Obama and the Pentagon in their news management effort.[1]
In a cemetery marked by green and white flags in Helmand's provincial
capital of Lashkar Gah, 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of Marjah, men
buried one Marjah resident who died of his injuries suffered in what his
brother said was coalition bombing three days ago.
"I buried him here,
because I couldn't take him back to my village," the brother, Sayed Wali,
a thin man in a faded blue tunic.

Veteran reporter, Kathy Gannon, with a record of independent reporting on
Afghanistan going back to October 2001, noted that the Taliban fighting
foreign forces in Marja are villagers.[2]
She also provided rare details on
victims of foreign forces there: Musa Jans home was hit by an aircraft
around February 16th killing five occupants inside including children; Sayed
Lal was outside in a field with a friend when he was shot by foreign
soldiers.
Assadullah, 22, was riding his motorcycle when the Americans fired
at him shattering his arm; Abdul Hamid, 12, was in front of his home when
raiding foreign forces arrived,
they were running and shooting. I tried to get back in my house, but they
shot me in the leg, and there were more bullets, and they shot me again in
the belly. Near me some other people fell into a canal. They called a plane
and they bombarded.[3]
On 27 February, foreign soldiers killed three people, including two
children, in Alasai district of Kapisa province. Mohammad Ashraf, a tribal
elder of Kotki area of Alasai district, giving details of the incident, told
AIP that,
"last night at around 2200 local time, French soldiers descended
from their helicopter in an area far from Waldikhel village of Kotki
area and laid an ambush. When people of the area learned about the
arrival of these forces, they started fleeing from their village when the
French forces opened fire at them."
The tribal elder added:
"As a result of
the firing, three people have been martyred, one of whom was nine-year-old Joma Gul, son of Gholam Rasul, another was 10-year-old Aghar Khan, son of
Morad Mohammad, and the third one was Faqir Mohammad, a young man."
A man who identified himself as Hamidullah said he had been in the home as
some 20 people gathered to celebrate the birth of a son when a group of men
he described as "U.S. Special Forces" surrounded the compound.
Saying he
witnessed one man's death, Hamidullah said,
"Daoud was coming out of the
house to ask what was going on. And then they shot him."
Then they killed a
second man, Hamidullah said. The rest of the group were forced out into the
yard, made to kneel and had their hands bound behind their back, he said,
breaking off crying without giving any further details.
A deputy provincial
council member in Gardez, Shahyesta Jan Ahadi, said news of the operation
has inflamed the local community that blames Americans.
"Last night, the
Americans conducted an operation in a house and killed five innocent people,
including three women. The people are so angry," he said.

LASHKARGAH, Feb 17, 2010:
An eight-year-old girl weeps while laying head on
her knees as foreign soldiers
handed over the bodies of her family members
killed during the ongoing
operation Moshtarak in southern Helmand province.
The girl, resident of Marja district, lost her 10 family members
in a NATO
missile strike.
The following Table details the 80-86 Afghan civilians killed by direct U.S/NATO
actions along several dimensions. The numbers represent a low-count insofar
as they do not include many Pashtun civilians killed in the Pakistani border
regions by U.S drone strikes.
The Table demonstrates that close to
three-quarters of all civilian deaths resulted from air strikes (including
the rocket strike in Marja on February 14th).
U.S/NATO occupation forces
killed civilians in the provinces of,
The
average number of civilians killed in an air strike was ten, whereas in a
ground attack it was 2.4.
But ground attacks are more deadly for foreign
occupation forces. Some 46% of civilian casualties were accounted for by two
deadly air strikes - the HiMars rocket strike upon a home in Marjah on
February 14th and that by U.S. Special Forces in Dai Kundi, Uruzgan on
February 22nd.
A Marjah resident noted,
Always when they storm a village the foreign troops never care about
civilian casualties at all. And at the end of the day they report the deaths
of women and children as the deaths of Taliban.[4]
Table Afghan and Pashtun Civilians killed by U.S/NATO Occupation Forces
during February 2010
And what is reported in the mainstream western press?
For the first two
months of 2010, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commissions Fareed
Hamidi trumpeted a dip in civilian deaths, announcing for all those willing
to listen that 71 civilians had died at the hand of Afghan and foreign
forces.[5]
The UN naturally parroted this gross under-count. In fact, as I
reported, foreign forces alone killed 150-156 Afghan civilians during the
first two months of 2010.[6] In other words, the AIHRC only counts one in
two Afghan civilians killed by foreign forces. Another font of propaganda,
the Soros-bankrolled Open Society Institute, reassured its readers that
protecting civilians and protecting troops in Afghanistan was part of the
new counterinsurgency-style offensive.[7]
In 2008, the UNAMA captured about 70% of Afghans killed by foreign forces,
but in 2009 the figure was under 40%, justifiably earning UNAMAs
performance as being faith-based (or ideologically-inspired) counting.
Sadly, groupies like the
western media, peace groups and even the
World
Socialist Web Site (wsws) uncritically go about citing spurious UNAMA
figures, for example endlessly mentioning that Afghan civilian deaths caused
by coalition forces have declined: naturally they have since the UNAMA
missed only 30% of such deaths in 2008, but 60% in 2009.
As I have argued and documented, in fact a trade-off exists between
protecting foreign occupation forces and Afghan civilians.[8]
Such trade-off
is best captured by the ratio of Afghan civilians killed per dead foreign
occupation soldier. This ratio was 4.97 in 2007, 3.19 for 2008, 1.94 for
2009, and for Jan-Feb 2010 it was 1.48.[9]
In effect, the Obama regimen
involved trading off US/NATO soldier deaths for fewer Afghan civilian ones
in order to placate critical NATO members.[10]
Conclusion
Air strikes still kill the majority of Afghan civilians.
The absolute number
of Afghan civilians killed by foreign occupation forces is not
declining.[11] The mainstream western media with few exceptions and
organizations like UNAMA and the AIHRC de facto serve the Obama news
management effort by severely under-reporting Afghan civilians killed by
foreign forces.
