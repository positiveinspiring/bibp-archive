Azerbaijan today is a country that is geopolitically and strategically vital to the United States and the free world. The original Republic of Azerbaijan was formed in 1918 in the wake of World War I, as the first nation in the Caucasus to establish an independent, secular, and democratic government with its own parliament, army and currency. However, not long thereafter, the newly formed state of Azerbaijan was taken over by the Soviet Union. On December 3, 1991, the people of Azerbaijan voted overwhelmingly in a referendum in favor of the formation of the new independent Republic of Azerbaijan after more than 70 years of Soviet rule.
Bordering on the Caspian Sea with rich agrarian productivity and its plentiful supply of natural resources, Azerbaijan can provide a stable source of energy and other products for generations to come. Today, more than ever, mutual understanding, cooperation, and commerce are essential to the development and peace and stability in this region. To this end, the United States - Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce (USACC) was established in 1995 to improve mutual understanding and create bonds of cooperation between the United States and Azerbaijan across a wide range of areas including commercial, cultural, educational, and scientific activities.

Stan Escudero is President of Shield Bearer L.L.C., a newly- established but already successful consulting firm based in Azerbaijan and Florida. A veteran Bakuvian, Stan first arrived in Azerbaijan in 1997 as Ambassador of the United States. Using his extensive access at the highest levels of the Azerbaijani government as well as his detailed knowledge of the Caucasus and Central Asia, Stan was always ready to help businessmen avoid the pitfalls of new endeavors in Azerbaijan or to resolve the problems endemic to business activity in a former Soviet economy. Ably supported by his popular and active wife Jaye, he quickly established a reputation and a productive track record as one ambassador who is dedicated to the success of American business abroad. Together they became and remain strong and effective supporters of USACC and AMCHAM.
Long a believer in the future of Azerbaijan and the outstanding opportunities available to the careful and well-advised investor, Stan is one advisor who put his money and his life where is mouth is. He retired in November, 2000, after almost 34 years of service with the American government. Within weeks demand for his knowledge and contacts brought him back to Azerbaijan as a consultant for such companies as British American Tobacco and as a member of the board of Central Asia Energy/Karasu Operating Company, the local arm of Moncrief Oil International. Many other clients sought his services and, by mid-summer 2001, Stan was spending more time in Baku than in America. At the urging of several clients he and Jaye agreed to return permanently and, by the end of August, Stan was back in Baku setting up a branch office of Shield Bearer. Jaye joined him in October. Their older son Alex already lived in Baku, working in import-export and, with the arrival in December of their younger son Benjamin, also engaged in import-export, the Escudero family was reunited in Azerbaijan.
Born in 1942 in Daytona Beach, Florida, Stan is a graduate of the University of Florida. He entered the American Foreign Service in 1967 -- he and Jaye were married that same year. In a career focused principally on Central and South Asia, Stan became a skilled navigator of the Washington labyrinth as well as a consummate regional expert. He and Jaye served in Pakistan (1967-68), Niger (1968-70), Iran (1971-75) Iran again (in an exciting 1978-79 undercover operation during the Iranian revolution), India (1984-87), as Political Advisor to the Commander-in-Chief of Central Command (Marine Gen. George Christ and Army Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf 1987-89), and Egypt (1990-92). In the latter year he was named the first ever American ambassador to the newly independent Republic of Tajikistan, a dangerous 1992-95 assignment during which he and his staff became the only U.S. embassy ever to be evacuated under fire inside Russian armor. He followed Tajikistan with a posting as ambassador to neighboring Uzbekistan (1995-97) before coming to Azerbaijan. At the time of his retirement in 2000, Stan was the only American diplomat ever to serve three ambassadorships in the nations of the former Soviet Union, making him the senior official of the government of the United States most experienced in this region.
A well-known public speaker and author of numerous magazine
and press articles on Azerbaijan, Stan lives and maintains offices at 74 Teymur
Aliyev Street, Ganglik, Baku. He can be reached by landline at 9-9412-906-406,

Kansans re-elected U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, champion of working families, government reform and cultural renewal to a full six- year term in November 1998. First elected to fill the remainder of Senator Bob Dole's term, Brownback was sworn in as Kansas' 32nd U.S. Senator on November 26, 1996.
In the 107th Congress, Brownback serves on four key committees: the Committee on Foreign Relations; the Committee on the Judiciary; the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation; and the Joint Economic Committee.
In 1997, Senator Brownback sponsored S. 1344; The Silk Road Strategy Act to target assistance to support the economic and political independence of the countries of South Caucasus and Central Asia. The bill also provided presidential authority to waive section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act. The Bill was later adopted as an amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, but the presidential waiver authority was removed by a close vote. Senator Brownback argued strenuously to retain the waiver authority, but Senators McConnell, Sarbanes, and others prevailed.
After September 11, 2002, Senator Brownback again renewed his efforts to secure a waiver for Section 907. Working closely with the Administration and colleagues who shared his views, his efforts prevailed on the FY2002 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill in December. On January 25, 2002 the President exercised his authority and for the first time waived Section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act.
Senator Brownback is Co-Chairman of the Silk Road Caucus along with his House Colleage from Pennsylvania, Joe Pitts. Senator Mary Landrieu from Louisiana is the Democratic Co-Cochairperson of the group.
As the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, Brownback has also taken an active role in developing U.S. foreign policy concerning India, Pakistan, and Iraq. Brownback also forcefully advocates for trade policy supporting U.S. agriculture exports in the international marketplace.
Brownback is the ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration. He is co-chair of the Senate Cancer Coalition, co- chair of the Congressional Wireless Caucus, and member of Senate Republican High Tech Task Force.
Prior to his election to the Senate, Brownback served one term as a U.S. Congressman representing the Second District of Kansas.
