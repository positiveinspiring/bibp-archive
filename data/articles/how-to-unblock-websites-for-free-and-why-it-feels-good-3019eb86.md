Previously the preserve of China and other
regimes considered controlling or oppressive, website blocking is now
becoming a common activity around the world. However, one doesnt have to
sit back and accept what third parties say you can and cannot see, even if
they do believe its for the greater good.
Unblocking blocked websites is possible with
fairly simple tools, takes just a few minutes to set up, and feels good -
real good.
Have you ever noticed that when someone tells
you what to do - or what not to do - you have a somewhat natural tendency to
go against their instructions?
In psychology its called reactance and is
something which occurs when we believe that someones orders, mechanisms,
rules or regulations are about to narrow our options or limit our behavioral
freedoms.
I love incredibly hot sauce (such as Daves
Insanity
Ghost
Pepper Sauce) even though it leaves me bent up in pain if I have too
much, which incidentally is anything more than a few drops.
On the label of these sauces it often orders you
NEVER, EVER under ANY circumstances to consume the sauce neat.
Yeah, right.
The problem is that there is something
inherently annoying about someone we dont know trying to impose their will
on us when we are perfectly capable of making our own decisions. Not only do
we inexplicably want the forbidden item even more than before, we kick back
and build up resentment against those attempting to restrict our freedoms.
For example, Ive never commented on a YouTube
video before but the idea that Google wants to force Plus down our necks in
order for us to do so fills me with rage, to the point where I've even
signed the petition.
All kinds of Internet restriction has this
effect on me.
Every time news breaks that another site has been blocked I
have an overwhelming desire to make sure I can still access it, even though
I may never have visited it in the past and have no intention of doing so in
the future.
That said, once the "This Site Has Been Blocked"
message appears theres nothing more immediately satisfying than unblocking
it, a feeling that parallels the challenging of "dont touch, wet paint"
when it turns out to be dry after all.
The good news is that satisfaction is just a few
clicks away for anyone who wants it and it doesnt have to cost a penny
either.
Here are a few of the most simple solutions that
will take a maximum of five to ten minutes for a novice to setup.
PirateBrowser
PirateBrowser is a simple tool provided by the
operators of The Pirate Bay. It allows anyone to quickly and simply
circumvent ISP and government web blocking.
The software is Tor-based and includes a version
of the popular Firefox browser which should be used when a site needs to be
unblocked. By mid October the tool had achieved around
one million downloads and according to Alexa is most popular among users
in South Korea.

Tor
Tor is perhaps the most famous tool to unblock
websites, avoid censorship and maintain privacy. It was originally designed
and implemented by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for protecting
government communications.
Today it used by people such as whistleblowers,
journalists and activists who may need to keep their identities secret. It
is also used by those looking to access censored webpages, hence its
inclusion in this list.

Virtual Private Networks - VPN
A
VPN is a group of computers networked over the
top of the worlds largest network -
the Internet.
Communications are
encrypted so VPNs are useful for maintaining privacy and, of course,
unblocking blocked websites.
There can be no doubt that paying a few dollars
per month for
a
premium account is the best option for those who have the money, but
basic and completely free options are available.
Perhaps the most interesting one is offered by
the Graduate School of University of Tsukuba, Japan.
The
VPN Gate Academic Experiment Project launched earlier this year aiming,
"to expand the knowledge of Global
Distributed Public VPN Relay Servers."
Like all technologies listed in this article,
its not necessary for beginners to understand how they work, just that they
do. Unlike Tor, dont expect total privacy with VPN Gate but be assured that
the service unblocks websites just fine.

Site-Specific Reverse Proxies
In the wake of the censorship of torrent sites
in,
-
the UK
-
the Netherlands
-
Italy
-
Denmark,
...and other countries around Europe, special
sites started to appear.
Known as reverse proxies, these webpages
access blocked sites and feed the content back to their own pages. To
visitors accessing the reverse proxy, the blocked site appears as normal.
There are hundreds of these available, such as
the selection available on
PirateReverse.info and
Come.in.
However, some reverse proxies themselves have
become subjected to censorship, meaning that they too are blocked at the ISP
level in,
General Web Proxies
General webpage proxies are sites which can
unblock most websites online via a simple interface. By simply entering the
URL of the blocked website into the search box of the web proxy, the blocked
site will become accessible.
There are hundreds of these web-based solutions
which can be uncovered by a simple
Google search, although
some are overloaded with adverts and cluttered interfaces.
On the plus side theyre all free so have a
browse around and find one you like. Some are available as a
browser
extension, which makes them even easier to use.
