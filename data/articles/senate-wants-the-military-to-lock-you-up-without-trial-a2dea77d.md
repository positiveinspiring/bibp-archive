Heres the best thing that can be said about the new detention powers the
Senate has tucked into next years defense bill: They dont force the
military to detain American citizens indefinitely without a trial.
They just let the military do that. And even
though the leaders of the military and the spy community have said they want
no such power, the Senate is poised to pass its bill as early as tonight.
There are still changes swirling around the Senate, but this looks like the
basic shape of the
2012 National Defense Authorization Act.
Someone the government says is,
a member of, or part of, al-Qaida or an
associated force can be held in military custody without trial until
the end of the hostilities authorized by the Authorization for Use of
Military Force.
Those hostilities are currently scheduled to end
the Wednesday after never.
The move would shut down criminal trials for
terror suspects.
But far more dramatically, the detention mandate to use indefinite military
detention in terrorism cases isnt limited to foreigners.
Its confusing,
because two different sections of the bill seem to contradict each other,
but in the judgment of the University of Texas Robert Chesney - a
nonpartisan authority on military detention:
U.S. citizens are included in
the grant of detention authority.
An amendment that would limit military detentions to
people captured
overseas failed on Thursday afternoon. The Senate soundly defeated a measure
to strip out all the detention provisions on Tuesday.
So despite the Sixth Amendments guarantee of a right to trial, the Senate
bill would let the government lock up any citizen it swears is a terrorist,
without the burden of proving its case to an independent judge, and for the
lifespan of an amorphous war that conceivably will never end.
And because the Senate is using the bill that
authorizes funding for the military as its vehicle for this dramatic
constitutional claim, its pretty likely to pass.
It would be one thing if the military was clamoring for the authority to
become the nations jailer.
But to the contrary:
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta opposes the
maneuver. So does CIA Director David Petraeus, who usually commands
deference from senators in both parties. Pretty much every security
official has lined up against the Senate detention provisions, from
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to FBI Director Robert
Mueller, who worry that theyll get in the way of FBI investigations of
domestic terrorists.
President Obama has promised to veto the bill. Which is ironic.
After all, Obama approved of
the execution without trial of Anwar al-Awlaki, al-Qaidas YouTube preacher,
based entirely on the unproven assertion that Awlaki was dangerous.
Awlaki was an American citizen. So Obama thinks
he has the right to kill Americans the government says are terrorists, but
he doesnt want the military to lock them up forever without trial. OK then.
Weirder still, the bills chief architect, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), tried
to persuade skeptics that the bill wasnt so bad.
His pitch?
The requirement to detain a person in
military custody under this section does not extend to citizens of the
United States, he said on the Senate floor on Monday.
The bill would just let the government detain a
citizen in military custody, not force it to do that. Reassured yet?
Civil libertarians arent. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) said it,
denigrates the very foundations of this
country.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) added,
it puts every single American
citizen at risk.
But theres a reason this measure goes into the
defense bill: Voting against the defense bill is usually considered
political suicide. Thats why the bill will almost certainly pass tonight.
If Obama backs down from his veto threat, get
ready to see Americans at Guantanamo Bay.
Occupied America
Senate Bill 1867 Would Allow U.S. Military
to Detain and
Murder Anti-Government Protesters in American Cities

I don't know if you're all getting this through your heads yet, but
Senate
Bill 1867 - the National Defense Authorization Act - would openly
"legalize" the U.S. government's detainment and murder of OWS protesters and
the assassination of talk show hosts, bloggers, journalists and anyone who
holds a so-called "anti-government" point of view.
This is the open and
blatant declaration of war against any who do not going along with,
-
TSA thugs
reaching down your pants
-
the Goldman Sachs economic takeover of nations
-
the secret arrest and torture of American citizens,
...and other acts of
outright tyranny waged by an out-of-control government.
Those who have been burying their heads in the sand over the coming police
state need to wake up and face the music.
That U.S. Senators would knowingly
and willfully attempt to pass a bill that legalizes the indefinite
detainment, torture and killing of American citizens with no due process
whatsoever - and on American soil! - is nothing less than a traitorous
betrayal of the once-free American people. These are, our founding fathers
would have said, acts of war against the People.
They reveal the insidious
plan to put in place a legal framework to end the Bill of Rights, murder
protesters, and overrun America with total police state brutality.
And yet the sheeple are still asleeple
I grow weary of trying to warn the American people to wake up and see what
is now right in front of their eyes, so for those who want to read these
words themselves - right in the Senate bill - you can read it
here.
And YES, it has now been confirmed that the indefinite detainment and murder
provisions do apply to American citizens on the streets of American cities.
As Sen. Lindsey Graham explained in plain language on the Senate floor:
"...1031, the statement of authority to detain, does apply to American
citizens and it designates the world as the battlefield, including the
homeland."
That means America, for those of you who are still wondering what "homeland"
means.
It's a phrase borrowed from Nazi Germany, of course, which is the
source of much of this legislation as you might have noticed.
"The power is so broad that even U.S.
citizens could be swept up by the military and the military could be
used far from any battlefield, even within the United States itself,"
says the ACLU.
Homefront - The U.S. government's war against the People
If this bill passes and is signed into law, it would mean that America's war
machine could then be turned against the American people - liberal,
conservative, libertarian... it doesn't matter.
If you question the
government, you are suddenly an "enemy combatant" and they will cite this
law as the legal justification for putting a bullet in your head,
fire-bombing your little protest group, or literally running over you and
your buddies with tanks.
(And they won't stop like China did in Tiananmen
Square when that one brave citizen stood up against tyranny there in 1989.)
The premeditate murder of U.S. protesters (Occupy Wall Street, anyone?) is
now being codified into law as the government's "right."
Of course, your
rights to Free Speech, due process, owning a firearm and other rights are
being obliterated in the process. Only the government has "rights" now,
didn't you know?
The slaves of the nation (i.e. the citizens) are being
stripped of all rights, including the right to grow your own food, have a
picnic or even buy fresh dairy products from a farmer.
Governments routinely murder far more people than terrorists
Right now, every history teacher in America should be absolutely outraged
about all this, as they know what always comes next in the history of
nations.
Once any government "legalizes" the murder of its own citizens, it
is inevitably followed by a mass-murder holocaust-style event.
Tyrants, you see, always like to "legalize" their mass murder before they
pull the trigger. Just read the history of Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Mao and
others. In every case, they worked diligently to put into place a legal
framework for the mass murder that was about to be unleashes on their own
citizens. That legal framework looks strikingly similar to Senate Bill 1867,
which is about to be passed.
This also brings to mind the mathematical reality that, statistically
speaking, governments are orders of magnitude more deadly than terrorists.
While terrorists sometimes success in taking out a few thousand people at a
time, governments routinely murder tens of MILLIONS of people.
It's called GENOCIDE, and there's a long and well-documented history of
how
governments have committed genocide year after year, one nation
after another.
See more statistics at:
http://www.scaruffi.com/politics/dictat.html
So if the People of America had any courage at all, they would be running
the People's road blocks and searching government vehicles for weapons!
It
is the government agents, after all, who are statistically at the highest
risk of engaging in mass murder, and very soon the U.S. Senate looks likely
to effectively legalize that mass murder.
At the airports, We the People should be searching the TSA employees and
checking them for illegal drugs, child pornography and stolen electronics.
At government buildings, We the People should be searching all the
government employees who come and go to make sure they don't stage the
demolition of their own buildings as a way to blame whatever convenient
enemy they want to discredit - patriots, conservatives, "conspiracy
theorists" or what have you.
It's no longer a conspiracy theory, you see, that the government wants to
have the legal right to openly murder U.S. citizens right on the streets of
America.
It's written right into the Senate bill. It's public record. So all
those out there still clinging to their pathetic denialist "conspiracy
theorists" rants can now clamp shut their pie holes and throw themselves off
a cliff or something.
It's time to face the reality of the total police
state tyranny that's now written in black and white, plain as day.
All of you who are still obsessed with your narrow world view of fashion,
dancing with the stars, microwaveable processed food and fake mainstream
news are about to be rocked out of your easy chairs and dumped into the
cesspool of tyranny at your doorstep. Just know that when they come for you,
there will be nobody left to speak for you, because you remained silent as
all this was rolled out.
And I won't be there for you, either, because I'll
be holed up in Texas, handing out emergency food supplies to the local
churches and performing emergency medicine procedures on those protesters
wounded by U.S. government military attacks - the ones that are still
alive, anyway.
You think none of this is coming? Why would the U.S. Senate write this into
law if they didn't intend on using it to murder Americans? Maybe you need to
clear the cobwebs out of your head and open your eyes to what's really
happening right now in the U.S. Senate.
Read between the lines, folks. It's not that difficult to get the full
picture here.
The very idea that the U.S. Senate is even considering such a
law to "legalize" the detainment and murder of U.S. citizens on U.S. soil by
U.S. troops is, all by itself, a complete and utter crime against the
American people.
The U.S. Senate is about to declare WAR on the American people
And I don't
mean that metaphorically.
They are trying to make this a military war where
anyone who opposes the U.S. government - even if they have nothing at all
to do with "terrorism" - is now a fair game target for precision bombings,
assassinations and heavy military armor (i.e. tanks rolling down your
driveway).
Some good news:
Congressman Dennis Kucinich has publicly spoken out against
the bill (even though he's not in the Senate). So has Sen. Rand Paul. His
father, Ron Paul, has also stated his opposition to the illegal detainment
provision of the bill. There are hints that if the bill passes, President
Obama may veto it. If he did, that would be one of the most profound
freedom-protecting actions of his administration, but don't hold your breath
on that count.
You never know what these politicians will do when they think
they have the power to murder their own citizens - they're drunk with
power, after all, and they love to rule over the masses with a kind of
devilish insanity.
Remember:
Obama already has a "kill list" of Americans to
be murdered overseas, but this new Senate Bill 1867 would legalize that
right on U.S. soil.
So one day you call in to talk radio and express your discontent with the
President, let's say, and the next day a U.S. marine scout sniper sets up
his .338 sniper rifle a couple hundred yards from your house, waits for you
to sit down to watch Anderson Cooper vomit out the evening's news
propaganda, and then he pulls the trigger and blows your neck off, causing
your head to land smack dab in that bowl of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese you
were just trying to shovel down your threat because someone told you it was
"food."
This will all be LEGAL under the new Senate bill 1867 because they
will claim you were a "terrorist collaborator" who questioned the wisdom of
the executive leadership of America.
Once due process is stripped away,
anything can be justified by the government, including the open murder of
its own citizens.
This is the whole point of a nation of LAW. The laws describe specific legal
rights afforded to citizens, but most importantly they describe the LIMITS
of power of government. It is those limits that the government is now trying
to completely obliterate, turning America into a complete military
dictatorship / fascist nation where laws are only applied to the People, not
to the government itself.
These are practically the exact words recently
uttered by Newt Gingrich during a recent debate, in which he said due
process and the Bill of Rights should only apply to people who engage in
common criminal acts such as stealing or robbing people.
But no such rights
or due process privileges should exist when there is a "war" going on,
Gingrich insisted! And the U.S. Senate is about to declare the entire USA
"homeland" to be a battlefield of a never-ending war, get it?
Are you grokking all this yet? These tyrants are about to declare the entire
USA a battlefield where NO ONE has any due process, no Bill of Rights, no
protections under any law, nothing!
And if Gingrich becomes President - oh my God
please don't let this happen - then we are looking at the runaway
militarization of everything in America, including a huge ramping up of the
so-called "war on drugs" which we've already exposed as a
total
failure and a complete hoax.
If this bill passes and is signed into law by the President, the USA is
officially at war with its own People, and you can expect the government
will immediately begin staging false flag bombings so they can justify a
multi-year campaign of total genocide against all who refuse to cower down
to the (now admitted) anti-freedom tyrants in Washington.
We are on the verge of losing America, my friends.
I ask:
What the hell are
YOU going to do about it?
Here's the list of traitors in the U.S. Senate who have supported this bill:
