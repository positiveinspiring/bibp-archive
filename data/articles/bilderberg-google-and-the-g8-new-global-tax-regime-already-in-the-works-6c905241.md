This years annual
Bilderberg conference
is rapidly approaching -
where the worlds political and business elite
meet in private to
discuss their agenda
which will determine
future policies that govern global affairs.
Some aspects of this years
Bilderberg agenda are gradually coming into
view, and have the potential for directly affecting not only big
multinationals like Google, but every business on the planet.
The secret gathering has been gradually forced into public view in recent
years, and the run-up to Bilderberg 2013 has been one of great anticipation
and not without its share of news.
First came the false start from the alternative
media regarding the meetings actual location, with many claiming it would
be held again at the Westfield Marriot in Chantilly, Virginia.
Two months after, the announcement arrived that
the meeting would take place 30 minutes north of London, at the Grove Hotel
in Hertfordshire, England, and small media circus is expected the year
following the announcement that a Bilderberg Fringe festival is being
organized adjacent to the venue - an event certain to attract hundreds, if
not thousands of revelers, press and alternative media personalities.
Add to this the news that long time Bilderberg
sleuth and American Free Press correspondent, Jim Tucker had passed
away on April 24th.
Few people would even know the Bilderberg
meetings ever took place if not for 30 years of digging and reporting by
veteran journalist Tucker.

Beyond all the fanfare, however, the central
question still remains:
what items will be on the agenda at this years
ultra-secret transatlantic steering committee?
The answer to this question
may be hidden in plain site.
Google is currently engaged in a battle over
unpaid taxes in the UK, and which has led political commentators to now call
for a new system of global taxation. Not surprisingly, this has become the
chief topic of discussion at a series of global summits taking place during
May and June.
Heres how this major issue rose out of the
Google debate, and how it will be folded into Bilderbergs 2013 agenda, and
later to the G8 Summit shortly thereafter
Googles Big Tent - A
Digital-Davos
This past week witnessed another major global
conference held at the very same Grove Hotel in Hertfordshire.
The parallels to Bilderberg are striking - they
share the same guests, the same venue, observe similar codes on conduct, and
no doubt have similar items on their agenda.
Googles Zeitgeist Global Summit, or "Big
Tent" event, is effectively the internets version of a Digital Davos,
where the best and the brightest are invited to hear the latest big
ideas, with debates and keynote speeches from the likes of,
-
Bill Clinton (Bilderberg member)
-
UK Chancellor George Osborne
-
UK Labour Party leader Ed Miliband,
...and other celebrities including Stephen
Hawking.
Its worth pointing out here that both Osborne
and Miliband have played the role of Googles adversary in public during
their corporation tax row, yet they are the corporations VIP guests in
private.
Beyond the high profile talks and entertainment,
there were of course, some serious discussion about big ideas taking place
under the big tent. This years event also required participants to observe
Chatham House Rules, meaning key conversations should be held in the
strictest of confidence and not be leaked to the outside world.
As with Bilderberg, Googles Big Tent discusses
serious global changes that affect present and future generations -
all behind closed doors.
Other persons of note at this years Google
retreat were,
-
former US attorney general and Bush
legal brain, Alberto Gonzales
-
former Secretary of State Hillary
innovation adviser, Alec Ross
-
key Putin advisor Arkady Dvorkovich
-
Swedish foreign affairs minister, Carl
Bildt (Bilderberg attendee 2006-2012)
The profile of Google and Bilderberg guests has
seen an incredible overlap in recent years, which is a testament to the
corporations own stated ambition to achieve a global dominion, not only
over its marketplace, but over cultural and political life as well.
The reality in 2013 is that Google is poised to
manage nearly every aspect of our lives - our communications, our work, our
social life and even our history.
Bilderbergs Digital Tycoons
As Googles global summit runs smoothly into
Bilderberg this year, so have the two meeting agendas. Recent years have
seen an increase in the influx of digital tycoons present at Bilderberg.
Alongside software moguls like,
-
Craig Mundie, Head of Research and
Strategy Officer at Microsoft (Bilderberg attendee 2006-2012)
-
Google CEO Eric Schmidt (Bilderberg
attendee 2007-2011),
...the social media kingpins have also
moved in to occupy key positions in Bilderbergs top steering committees.
A key player in amongst them is Peter
Thiel (above), head of Clarium Capital, the digital
investment house that provided the financial clout which allowed for online
ventures like,
-
Paypal
-
Facebook
-
LinkedIn
-
Friendster,
...to dominate their
digital marketplaces.
Thiel was promoted to Bilderberg committee head
in 2011 and has emerged as a key player not only in the online industries,
but also as an influencer in US political spheres, gaining attention
recently as a prominent backer of Kentuckys Republican junior Senator Rand
Paul.
New global Google Tax
already in the works
The convergence of the Google Summit, its tax
battle, and Bilderberg 2013 may seem innocent enough on its surface, but the
timing is no mere coincidence.
UK leadership have whipped up a frenzy in the
media over Googles alleged tax sins, leaving the public clamoring for a
solution. The words "never let a good crisis go to waste"
certainly chime in well here.
Two weeks ago, a major UK clash erupted between
No. 10 Downing Street and Google over the issue of corporate tax evasion.
Googles Matt Brittin was grilled by the
UKs Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and its chair Margaret Hodge,
who accused Google "doing evil" by using an elaborate array of offshore
entities in a "smoke and mirrors" financial maze designed to avoid paying
any significant tax into UK coffers.
Both PM David Cameron and Chancellor
George Osborne also came out loudly in public accusing Google of being
immoral. Google is said to have only chipped in 6 million GBP in 2011 out
of its 3 billion GBP turnover in that same year.
Googles Peter Baron claims its in full
compliance with UK law, issuing the public statement last week that,
"None of the allegations put to us change
the fact that Google pays the corporate tax due on its UK activities and
complies fully with UK law."
Will Google throw in the towel and submit to a
British tax resolution?
The fact of matter is Google is powerful and with a net worth that trumps
some countries. These days much of the worlds commerce runs through Google
in some way, and their brand recognition and money buys influence in
Britain, and everywhere else it seems.
So its doubtful that any British
politico could strong-arm Google.
Behind the scenes both Google and Britains
political elite share a place at central plannings top round table - as
members of
the Bilderberg Group and thats where the really big ideas are
not just discussed, but actually transmitted into policy.
As the public feud between Google and
Downing Street takes centre stage, backstage both UK Chancellor George
Osborne and Google CEO Eric Schmidt - both committed fellow Bilderberg
members, are said to have met in private at the Google event, and are poised
to do so again at Bilderberg 2013.
Both have attended the annual meeting
almost continuously since 2006.
George Osborne:
Attacks Google in public, but VIP guest
and fellow Bilderberger to
Goolge CEO Schmidt in private.
So this apparent Punch n Judy match between
Google and Downing Street appears just three weeks before this years
Bilderberg summit, and four weeks before the G8, and suddenly the UK
government and media outlets have become infested with a the new talking
point:
"we need for a new global profit tax."
While addressing the Google tax loophole, the
UKs Independent newspaper led by its liberal-leaning economics editor
Ben Chu, goes on to essentially lay-out what is likely to be at the top of
the agenda at Bilderberg 2013:
"The cascade of revelations in recent months
showing multinational companies doing a huge amount of business here and
yet paying virtually no corporation tax has provoked widespread public
demands for something to be done.
National governments could and should try to
put a stop to this egregious "profit shifting" on their own. But a
unilateral approach is plainly second best.
The natural solution is to secure an
agreement by all the worlds governments to tax the profits of
multinational firms collectively and to divide up the revenues fairly
between them.
This division could be based on the amount
of business done by the multinational in their various territories as
revealed by their turnover and number of employees."
Global tax means global
government
So,
-
Is Google supplying the Trojan horse
needed to implement a global taxation system that many have been
warning about for so many years? Maybe.
-
Will Bilderbergs global elite use this
perfect crisis moment as a pretext to build the framework for global
taxation? Most likely.
-
If the idea passes through
Bilderberg in June, will it then be rubber stamped later at the G8?
Highly likely.
Although happy to float such a revolutionary
idea in the media in advance of back-to-back Google and Bilderberg summits
at the Grove Hotel, and later at the G8, one thing which global taxation
advocates fail to mention here is that if you institute a global taxation
system then you would then need a global government to administrate it.
Yes, you heard that right: global taxation =
global government.
It would be naive to think that any tax could be levied without a government
standing behind it. That is, after all, part of the definition of a tax.
Campaigners will deny it exists, but the reality is that global governing
bodies have already been put into place long ago.
UK Column Editor Mike Robinson
explains,
"I think that the embryonic global
institutions are already in place, and were going to see them being
given more and more real jobs to do as time goes on, and collecting
corporation tax is clearly going to be one of those".
History can certainly prove one thing:
that the worlds wealthiest individuals
corporations have consistently exploited all international tax loopholes
for years now.
Whatever commentators like Ben Chu and others
are proposing will obviously be much easier to enforce on small to medium
size businesses, as well as individual traders - all of whom have
significantly less political leverage (and no invitations to Bilderberg)
than the Googles and Facebooks of the world.
Post-Bilderberg - G8 Summit
Following the ratification of Bilderbergs 2013
agenda in Watford on June 6-9th, the next step is normally to disseminate
this same agenda on to the G8 heads of state.
Conveniently, this years G8 summit will held
June 17-18 at the
Lough Erne golf resort in Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.
David Cameron and George Osbornes new plan for
Google is already expected to be very high on the agenda at
the (next) G8 meeting,
where world leaders including Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin will be in
attendance.
Henceforth, ahead of the G8, the UK government
is expected to play their key role in promoting the new global tax system,
by publically advocating,
"new strong international standards to make
sure that global companies pay the tax they owe."
Coincidentally, this years G8 in Northern
Ireland will be the biggest police operation in countrys history (and
thats saying a lot), with an estimated 8,000 officers from the surrounding
counties, and from as far as England and Wales, all drafted in to secure the
area for what many now believe has essentially become a global government
operations meeting in all but name.
Other recent attempts at a
global tax
The financial component of this global tax and
government equation is actually already in place, and that is
the World
Bank.
The first administrative working model for a
global taxation structure was originally unveiled in 2009 at the United
Nations Climate Summit in Copenhagen. Delegates at that event floated their
plan for a
global carbon tax that would be collected and then deposited into
a slush fund which was to be administered by the World Bank.
Their plan also entailed the poorer, developing
nations footing most of the bill for this operation, while the wealthier
nations would receive a free pass. The secret plan was thwarted at the last
minute thanks to the infamous
Danish Text Leak, which were serialized in the Guardian newspaper at the
time.
Although popular in socialist circles, few have
dared reveal the true picture of a global tax regime for fear of triggering
a public backlash.
Another such tax proposals have been pushed into
the public sphere through the Occupy Movement in 2011, with called for a
global tax on financial transactions, or a global "Robin Hood Tax".
As was the case in Copenhagen two years earlier,
proponents called for a tax structure without borders, yet few dared mention
who would be in charge of administering and distributing the revenues.
Such plans pose the very real danger of further
centralizing power into the international banking community who would be
asked to handle and perhaps hypothecate on these enormous slush funds.
Which brings us back to this latest global
google tax proposal, which ultimately begs the question:
When will their
global government
structure be unveiled?
Serving the global collective
The media and political elite will have the
public believe that there are not enough laws and regulations already in
place to deal with apparent problems like large multinationals avoiding
corporation tax.
The fact is there are regulations in place, and
all that is needed is to tighten them. So why jump ahead to insist a global
tax system is necessary to solve the issue?
Plans for erecting an entirely new global tax system should worry anyone who
values the concept of national sovereignty because any solution that entails
the collection of tax by way of elite international "collective" of
nations, and where "revenues are to divided up fairly between them" is
suggesting a form of global collectivism, or communism.
This is also the
fundamental problem with EU plans to levy new taxes on member nations - for
any citizen its simply another master to serve.
It starts with corporate tax, and once that door is opened, its anyones
guess how wide their new regime will stretch.
Shocking as that may be, these issues are
exactly what is being discussed behind closed doors at each of these global
summits taking place in May and June of 2013.
Whats worse, is that this entire
construct could be ushered in without any vote being cast by any citizen in
the individual countries - which is about as undemocratic as it gets.
This remains one of the fundamental flaws
at the heart of the ultra-liberal utopian ideal which is
global government.
