According to a poll recently conducted
for Reuters,
about 10 percent of the entire global population is
convinced that we could witness the end of the world
in 2012. When
we get to 2013, a similar poll will probably find that 10 percent of
the entire global population is convinced that the world may not
survive until 2014.
-
A whole host of medical studies have
shown a connection between cell phones and cancer. The World Health
Organization
has even admitted that
cell phones can cause cancer.
But nearly all of us continue to use cell phones very heavily.
-
Genetically modified crops have been
shown to have some very negative effects on the environment and on
human health. But the USDA has approved 80 different genetically
engineered crops and has never denied a single one. At this point,
approximately 70 percent of all processed foods in the United States
contain genes that have been genetically engineered.
-
The TSA is entrusted with making sure
that no terrorists get on board our airplanes. But the TSA has been
hiring new employees
without even conducting
background checks first to make sure that the new employees are not
terrorists...
-
In a move that could affect security at airports around the nation,
the Transportation Security Administration confirmed Wednesday it
had such a backlog of background security checks, airport employers
were allowed to hire any employee needed.
TSA officials said the background checks are delayed, but they are
processing them as fast as they can.
TSA also will complete background checks on accepted applicants at a
later date.
-
In Los Angeles, it was discovered that
four TSA employees were taking huge bribes to allow suitcases full
of "cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana" to pass through airport
security. But the federal government thinks the TSA is doing such a
good job that their duties have been expanded to include buses and
subway stations.
-
Barack Obama wants to convince all of us
that it is not a big deal that he is now admitting that the "New
York girlfriend" in his 1995 autobiography "Dreams From My Father"
was actually a "composite character". Tens of millions of Americans
will believe him.
-
Down in Florida recently, a frightened
wife was able to struggle free from her abusive husband who was
choking her and fire a single warning shot into the ceiling. So who
is the law coming down on? It is the abused wife that is going to be
sentenced to
20 years in prison.

A total of $205,075 was spent to move a
single bush that was standing in the way of a highway-renovation
project in California. It turns out that an identical bush could
have been purchased at a local store for
less than 16 bucks...
-
The bush - a Franciscan manzanita
- was a specimen of a commercially
cultivated species of shrub that can be purchased from nurseries for
as little as $15.98 per plant.
The particular plant in question,
however, was discovered in the midst of the City of San Francisco,
in the median strip of a highway, and was deemed to be the last
example of the species in the wild.
-
The federal government is telling us
that old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs
have to be phased out
because they are supposedly bad for the environment. But the new CFL
light bulbs are actually worse for the environment. They are filled
with mercury and they are so toxic that if they are broken they
require
special clean up procedures.
-
Obama's top science adviser, John
Holdren, has suggested that we should extensively use geo-engineering
to purposely cool the climate of the earth.
The following is how CBS News
described one of his ideas for
accomplishing this...
-
Shooting sulfur particles (like those produced by power plants and
volcanoes, for example) into the upper atmosphere, an idea that
gained steam when it was proposed by Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen in
2006. It would be "basically mimicking the effect of volcanoes in
screening out the incoming sunlight," Holdren said.
Apparently Holdren never watched The Matrix, because if he did he
would know that blocking out the sun is a really, really bad idea.
-
There are 1.4 million gang members
living inside the United States today and illegal immigration is
totally out of control. But the Obama administration has decided to
make border security even weaker by pulling
900 National Guard
troops away from the U.S./Mexico border.
-
In Maryland, one man recently
called 911
to report to the police that someone had just stolen his marijuana.
Needless to say, the man never got his marijuana back.
-
It has been estimated that prescription
drugs
kill 200,000 Americans every single year. Yet Americans
continue to gobble
prescription drugs down at a faster pace then
ever before.
-
Burger King is testing a new ice cream
sundae that comes with
two strips of bacon crammed into it. There
are some Americans out there that will actually eat such a thing.
-
Right now, China is holding over a
trillion dollars of U.S. government debt. But that didn't stop the
U.S. government from sending China
17.8 million dollars in foreign
aid during 2011.
-
According to Gallup, if the presidential
election was held today 46 percent of all U.S. voters would vote for
Mitt Romney and 45 percent of all U.S. voters would vote for Barack
Obama.
