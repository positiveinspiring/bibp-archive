As Trump plays the Protectionist card on global trade, China is wasting no time in taking over the lead with globalization. It intends to re-open the famous trade route called the Silk Road, which connected Asia with Europe. Instead of dirt roads and paths, the new "Belt and Road" project will span 65 nations and cost upwards of $1 Trillion. However, it will revolutionize global trade and give China a wide-open door to Europe and the Mideast. As a Technocracy, China will naturally seek to build infrastructure to connect to as many trading centers as possible. Belt and Road will be the largest infrastructure ever undertaken. Meanwhile, Trump's hardline rhetoric against China during the campaign cycle has turned to sawdust. China is wasting no time to take advantage of it. China was the Trilateral Commission's love child in the 1970s, and they orchestrated the transformation from a Communist dictatorship to a Technocracy. There is a good possibility that the protectionist' movement in the West is being manipulated in order for China to rise to global leadership. If true, then the timing and the result is perfect.

China is hosting a summit on the new 'Silk Road' - a massive global trade project

Original news on AFP Website
China opens on Sunday a summit to promote its massive global trade infrastructure project, highlighting Beijing's ambitions to spearhead a new era of globalization as Washington shifts toward inward-looking policies. President Xi Jinping will host leaders from 29 nations in Beijing for a two-day forum on his signature foreign policy program, a revival of the Silk Road dubbed the One Belt, One Road Initiative (OBOR.) The Chinese-bankrolled project, unveiled in 2013, seeks to link the country with Africa, Asia and Europe through an enormous network of ports, railways, roads and industrial parks.
The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network
of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction
through regions of the Asian continent connecting the East and West
and stretching from the Korean peninsula and Japan
to the Mediterranean Sea.
The initiative spans some 65 countries representing 60 percent of the world population and around a third of global gross domestic product. The China Development Bank has earmarked $890 billion for some 900 projects. Belt and Road is seen as a practical solution to relieve China's industrial overcapacity.
But it could also serve Beijing's geopolitical ambitions.
"In my view, Belt and Road is intended to create greater economic interdependence between China and its neighbors, which Beijing hopes will translate into increased political influence," said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Xi Jinping wants China to become the dominant regional power in an essentially Sino-centric order," Glaser told AFP.
The Chinese government describes the initiative as a partnership.
"What we need is not a hero that acts alone, but partners of cooperation that stick together," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said recently.
One-way street?
State-run media has worked hard to explain the project to the world. The English-language newspaper China Daily has bombarded social media with quirky videos, including an American father telling his daughter bedtime stories about Xi's program and children singing,
"We'll share the goodness now, the Belt and Road is how."
But few Western leaders are attending the event. The prime ministers of Italy, Spain and Greece are expected, while Washington is sending a senior White House adviser. Xi is championing globalization at a time when the concept's traditional leader, the United States, is focused on "America First" under US President Donald Trump.
The two countries, however, sealed a deal Friday for China to export cooked poultry to America and resume US beef imports.

Europe, meanwhile, is mired in Britain's looming EU exit.
"The structure of the global economy is changing... In this situation we want to be completely open and outward looking," said Zhang Xueliang, economics professor at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.
At the same time, the European Union has pressed China to practice what it preaches and further open its own market.
"Hopefully (Belt and Road) is not a one-way street but a two-way," said Joerg Wuttke, president of the European chamber of commerce in Beijing.
Indian concerns Other leaders attending the summit include Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Among neighbors, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and a delegation from North Korea are coming. But Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not confirm his attendance. India has voiced displeasure at the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a Belt and Road project aimed at linking northwestern China to the Arabian Sea.

The route cuts through Gilgit and Baltistan in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, disputed territory that India claims is illegally occupied. Human Rights Watch raised concerns on Saturday about the treatment of people along the new Silk Road route in Central Asian nations with poor track records in infrastructure projects. The US-based organization said Chinese authorities have,
"heightened surveillance and repression to prevent potential unrest that could impede" Belt and Road plans in the western Xinjiang region.
