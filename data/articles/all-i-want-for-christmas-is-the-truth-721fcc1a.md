"Eyes blinded by the fog of
things
cannot see truth.
Ears deafened by the din of things
cannot hear truth.
Brains bewildered by the whirl of things
cannot think truth.
Hearts deadened by the weight of things
cannot feel truth.
Throats choked by the dust of things
cannot speak truth."
Harald Bell Wright - The Uncrowned King
I consider myself a seeker of truth. It isn't
easy finding it in today's world. In an alternate version of the famous
scene from
A Few Good Men, I picture
myself telling Turbo Tax Timmy Geithner that I want the truth and his angry
truthful response:
"Son, we live in
a world that has Wall Street banks, and those banks have to be guarded by
puppet politicians in Washington D.C. with lobbyist written laws and Madison
Avenue PR maggots with media propaganda. Who's going to do it? You? You,
Representative Paul?
I have a greater
responsibility than you could possibly fathom. You weep for the average
middle class American family, and you curse the ruling oligarchs. You have
that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know. That the death
of the American middle class, while tragic, probably saved the bonuses of
thousands of Wall Street bankers.
And my existence,
while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, increases the wealth of these
same bankers who destroyed the worldwide economic system in 2008.
You don't want
the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about in the food bank
line, you want me on Wall Street, you need me on Wall Street. We use words
like derivative, fiscal stimulus, quantitative easing. We use these words as
the backbone of a life spent syphoning off the wealth of the nation. You use
them as a punch line.
I have neither
the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps
under the blanket of the very debt that I provide, and then questions the
manner in which I provide it. I would rather you just said thank you, and
went on your way, otherwise, I suggest you pick up 1000 shares of Apple, and
hope our high frequency trading supercomputers can ramp the market for a
while longer.
Either way, I
don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to."
I find myself more amazed than ever at the
ability of those in power to lie, misinform and obfuscate the truth, while
millions of Americans willfully choose to be ignorant of the truth and yearn
to be misled.
It's a match made in heaven.
Acknowledging the truth of our society's descent
from a country of hard working, self-reliant, charitable, civic minded
citizens into the abyss of entitled, dependent, greedy, materialistic
consumers is unacceptable to the slave owners and the slaves.
We can't handle the truth because that would
require critical thought, hard choices, sacrifice, and dealing with the
reality of an unsustainable economic and societal model. It's much easier to
believe the big lies that allow us to sleep at night.
The concept of lying to the masses and using
propaganda techniques to manipulate and form public opinion really took hold
in the 1920s and have been perfected by the powerful ruling elite that
control the reins of finance, government and mass media.
Peddlers of Propaganda
"Great is
truth, but still greater, from a practical point of view, is silence about
truth."
Aldous Huxley -
Brave New World
Adolf Hitler understood the power of the big lie
over the ignorant masses who want to believe:
"All this
was inspired by the principle - which is quite true within itself - that in
the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility;
because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the
deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and
thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall
victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they
themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to
resort to large-scale falsehoods.
It would
never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would
not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so
infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought
clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to
think that there may be some other explanation.
For the
grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been
nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to
all who conspire together in the art of lying."
Adolf Hitler -
Mein Kampf
We are all liars. We lie to friends, family and
co-workers.
We convince ourselves they are only small lies
and just protect others from being hurt. We would rather be lied to than
face the blunt truth about our deficiencies, shortcomings and failures.
Willfully believing mistruths allows a person to become dependent upon those
promulgating the mistruths.
It relieves them of their responsibility to act
upon the knowledge that something is wrong and must be fixed.
It is a cowardly path to ultimate servitude and
destruction. The German people chose this path in the 1930s and the American
people have chosen a similar and ultimately destructive path today.
The United States Office of Strategic Services
prepared a psychological profile report during the war describing Adolf
Hitler's method for controlling the minds of the German masses:
"His primary
rules were: never allow the public to cool off; never admit a fault or
wrong; never concede that there may be some good in your enemy; never leave
room for alternatives; never accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a
time and blame him for everything that goes wrong; people will believe a big
lie sooner than a little one; and if you repeat it frequently enough people
will sooner or later believe it."
America's corruptible politicians, greedy
corporate chieftains, criminal banking overlords, and despicable media
manipulators all learned the sordid lessons of mass propaganda from the
masters.
Our willingness to lie and be lied to set us up
to be manipulated by those who understood the mass psychology of a nation.
Goebbels and Hitler were heavily influenced by the father of propaganda -
Edward Bernays.
He and his disciples are professional poisoners
of the public mind, exploiters of public foolishness and ignorance, and
never allow truth to interfere with a good story. What master manipulators
realized is that it is easier to change the attitude of millions than the
attitude of one man.
By analyzing and understanding the process and
motives of how the group mind works, the invisible government has been able
to manipulate and regulate the masses according to their will without the
masses knowing they are being managed.
Bernays described this elitist view of the world
in 1928:
"Those who
manipulate the unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible
government which is the true ruling power of our country.
We are
governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested,
largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way
in which our democratic society is organized.
Vast
numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live
together as a smoothly functioning society. In almost every act of our lives
whether in the sphere of politics or business in our social conduct or our
ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons
who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses.
It is they
who pull the wires that control the public mind."
Edward Bernays -
Propaganda
The super-rich elite believe they are more
intelligent, more capable of managing the affairs of state, masters of the
financial world, and chosen to decide what is best for the masses.
In reality, they are egocentric, psychotic,
power hungry, myopic, self-serving ravenous vultures, feasting upon the
carcass of a once great nation.
Truth is inconsequential and irritating to
their plans for world domination and control. Therefore, no truth will be
forthcoming from any organization or person that is associated with the
existing political, economic, financial or social order.
Every bit of information that is permitted into
the public realm has been vetted, manipulated and spun for public
consumption. The public does not like bad news. They do not like hard facts.
They do not like to think or do math. They want to be spoon fed mindless
sound bites and happy talk.
The oligarchs need to keep the masses sedated
and subservient while they continue to plunder and pillage, so all data is
massaged to provide a happy ending. This is where I deviate from the ideologue
one-trick ponies that refuse to see both sides of the issue.
The ruling
oligarchs are wealthy, influential, psychotic, amoral, and few. The masses
are relatively poor, easily influenced, willfully ignorant, and many. The
ruling oligarchs are most certainly evil, but the masses are not the hard
working, stoic, downtrodden portrayed by liberal ideologues.
One just needs to walk down the street in one of
our urban enclaves, saunter through a suburban mall, or click on
People of Wal-Mart to witness
the tattooed, pierced, butt crack showing, slovenly, obese, and ignorant,
attached to their electronic iGadgets, to understand how far our society has
deteriorated.
Every individual born into this world has the
capability to become educated, think critically, not follow the herd, live
beneath their means, and not be influenced by propaganda.
Aldous Huxley understood in 1931 that those in
power could use material goods to invoke passivity and egotism among the
populace.
He feared that truth would be obscured by,
-
an avalanche of
irrelevance (500 Reality TV shows)
-
cultural trivialities (Lady Gaga,
Lindsey Lohan)
-
distractions (Professional sports)
-
pharmaceutical
enhanced escape (Prozac)
He saw the possibility that we would grow to
love our servitude as the pleasures of life provided by our controllers
overwhelmed any desire to think or question authority.
"There will
be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people
love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak,
producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that
people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will
rather enjoy it."
Aldous Huxley - The Doors Of Perception: Heaven and
Hell
By 1962 when Huxley wrote his last book, he was
certain that his worst dystopian nightmares had been unleashed. His
description of Western society fifty years ago could have been written today
and accurately reflected our current economic paradigm.
War, debt and consumption still make our world
go round, but the end is nigh.
"Armaments,
universal debt, and planned obsolescence - those are the three pillars of
Western prosperity. If war, waste, and moneylenders were abolished, you'd
collapse. And while you people are over-consuming the rest of the world
sinks more and more deeply into chronic disaster."
Aldous Huxley - Island
The pillars are crumbling:
-
the $1.4 trillion
wasted on two worthless wars of choice in the Middle East
-
the trillions
wasted and liberties sacrificed for the never ending unwinnable
War on
Terror
-
the Keynesian spending frenzy that has driven the National Debt from
$9 trillion to $16.3 trillion in the last five years
-
the looting of the
American taxpayer by Wall Street and their co-conspirators at
the Federal
Reserve and in Congress
-
the belief that ramping up the debt driven
consumption that drives 71% of our GDP is our path to prosperity,
...is
absolutely freaking nuts.
The pillars will not be abolished willingly. The
ruling class depends upon their continued existence and expansion. There is
the rub. The math doesn't work.
We've reached the point where continued
expansion of debt and money printing no longer works. With a national debt
to GDP ratio of 102% and a total credit market debt to GDP ratio of 350%, we
have passed the
Rogoff & Reinhart point of no
return.
This time is not different. A country cannot run trillion dollar
deficits indefinitely and expect to not suffer the consequences.
This is why those in power are increasingly
resorting to propaganda, data manipulation, and outright lies to convince
the masses of their omnipotence and brilliance in managing the fiscal
affairs of the state.
"One
believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them."
Aldous Huxley -
Brave New World
Through decades of mass media messaging the
masses have been conditioned to believe whatever those in power want them to
believe.
To our invisible government rulers we are
nothing but rats to be manipulated through food pellets and shock therapy.
Pleasure and fear of pain are the drivers of our warped society. The ruling
oligarchs truly think they know what is best for the masses and believe any
means is worthwhile as long as the ends support their agenda.
This is blatantly obvious to anyone with their
eyes open and their brain functioning.
Sadly, the government run educational system
produces mostly drones that are barely able to tie their own shoes, spell
Cat, or make change from a one dollar bill. Only 20% of all high school
seniors score high enough on the SAT test to get a B minus in college and
most of these kids come from private and parochial schools. This is exactly
what those in power prefer.
They want non-critical thinking, mindless
consumers, who don't understand the criminal nature of Federal Reserve
created inflation or their enslavement in the chains of debt at the hands of
their Wall Street slave owners.
They certainly don't want the masses to
understand that real median household net worth is lower today than it was
in 1969. Luckily for the oligarchs, 95% of the public couldn't define the
terms: real, median or net worth.
Math is hard...
The average person is inundated on a 24/7 basis
with pabulum from liberal network media talking heads,
-
CNBC Wall Street
shills regurgitating whatever their sponsors desire
-
Fox News blonde bimbos
and neo-con war mongers programmed to spew Rupert Murdoch talking points
-
MSNBC tingling leg faux journalists
-
NYT intellectually corrupt Nobel prize
winners
-
NAR nitwits repeating "best time to buy" on a daily basis for the
last 12 years,
...and government agencies whose sole purpose is to manipulate
data in a way that supports the agenda of those in power.
The intellectually lazy and willfully ignorant
masses are no match for those who control the message and the media.
How else can you explain their ability to
convince millions of drones to line up for hours in front of a store and
stampede like crazed hyenas to grab a $5 crockpot, the Chinese produced
gadget of the moment or a designer top made by slave labor in safety
conscious Bangladesh factories?
How else can you explain,
-
a population willing to
be molested by government TSA dregs in the name of security from phantom
terrorists
-
the passive acceptance of military exercises in US cities
-
unquestioning submissiveness as Presidential Executive Orders allow the
government dictatorial powers based on their judgment
-
the monitoring of
internet and voice correspondence of all citizens
-
the believing that FBI
agents luring clueless teenage Muslim dupes into fake terrorist plots,
providing the fake explosives, and then announcing with great fanfare how
they saved us from another 9/11?
But, the prize for boldest, most outrageous,
blatant use of propaganda and misinformation to cover-up their criminal
looting of America goes to Ben Bernanke, his cronies at the Federal Reserve,
and the Wall Street banks that own and control our Central Bank.
Having the gall to portray themselves as the
stabilizer of our economic system over the last 100 years is a putrid joke
on the dying and broke middle class. Their mandate has been stable prices,
full employment, and avoiding financial crisis.
It is a tribute to Bernays and the rest of the
public relations swine that the average American actually believes inflation
is a good thing and it is under control despite the FACT that 96.2% of their
purchasing power has disappeared since 1900, with the most rapid decline
occurring since Nixon closed the gold window in 1971.
The average American actually believes Ben
Bernanke saved us from a Great Depression when in actuality he saved the
owners of the Federal Reserve from accepting the losses they generated
through the greatest financial fraud in history.
His "solutions" have zombified our economic
system, just as the Japanese Central Bank did 20 years ago.
He has destroyed
the concept of saving, while rewarding the indebted and profligate with his
QE to Infinity money printing policies. And the ignorant masses have been
convinced by the corporate media and their corrupt government lackeys that
Ben did this for them.
Kyle Bass knows otherwise.
He knows how the Fed and their backers have
preyed upon the masses through their understanding of human psychology:
"Humans are
optimistic by nature. People's lives are driven by hopes and dreams which
are all second derivatives of their innate optimism.
Humans also
suffer from optimistic biases driven by the first inalienable right of human
nature which is self-preservation. It is this reflex mechanism in our
cognitive pathways that makes difficult situations hard to reflect and opine
on. These biases are extended to economic choices and events.
The primary
difficulty with this train of thought is the bias that most investors have
for the baseline facts: they tend to believe that the central bankers,
politicians, and other governmental agencies are omnipotent due to their
success in averting a financial meltdown in 2009.
Central banks
have become the great enablers of fiscal profligacy. The overarching belief
is that there will always be someone or something there to act as the safety
net. The safety nets worked so well recently that investors now trust they
will be underneath them ad-infinitum. Markets and economists alike now
believe that quantitative easing ("QE") will always "work" by flooding the
market with relatively costless capital.
Unlimited QE and
the zero lower bound ("ZLB") are likely to bankrupt pension funds whose
expected returns happen to be a good 600 basis points (or more) higher than
the 10?year "risk-free" rate. The ZLB has many unintended consequences that
are impossible to ignore.
Our belief
is that markets will eventually take these matters out of the hands of the
central bankers.
These
events will happen with such rapidity that policy makers won't be able to
react fast enough. The fallacy of the belief that countries that print their
own currency are immune to sovereign crisis will be disproven in the coming
months and years. Trillions of dollars of debts will be restructured and
millions of financially prudent savers will lose large percentages of their
real purchasing power at exactly the wrong time in their lives.
Again, the
world will not end, but the social fabric of the profligate nations will be
stretched and in some cases torn. Sadly, looking back through economic
history, all too often war is the manifestation of simple economic entropy
played to its logical conclusion.
We believe
that war is an inevitable consequence of
the
current global economic situation."
Kyle Bass
What's Normal in a Profoundly
Abnormal Society?
"The real
hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to
be most normal.
Many of
them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence,
because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that
they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic
does.
They are
normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are
normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect
adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness.
These
millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to
which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted."
Aldous Huxley -
Brave New World Revisited
No sane person could honestly say that what has
happened to our society over the last forty years, and particularly in the
last five years, is normal.
But somehow those in power have convinced the
masses that $1.2 trillion deficits, 0% interest rates, declining real wages,
the highest average gas prices in history, pre-emptive wars, policing the
world and buying rubber dog shit produced in China with a credit card is
normal and beneficial to our economy. It seems that I and a few million
other people in this country are the abnormal ones. We choose not to be led
to slaughter by our masters.
The seekers of truth have turned to the
alternative media and are able to connect with like-minded critical thinking
individuals on websites like Zero Hedge,
Jesse's Americain Café,
Of Two Minds,
Mish,
Financial Sense, among many
other truth seeking blogs.
This is dangerous to the powers that be and they
are using their political clout and extreme wealth to try and lock down and
control free speech on the internet. If this is accomplished all hope at
disseminating truth will be lost.
Abraham Lincoln once said that he believed in
the people and that if you told them the truth and gave them the cold hard
facts they would meet any crisis. That may have been true in 1860, but not
today.
The cold hard facts are available for all to
see:
-
A $16.3 trillion National Debt
-
47 million people on food stamps
-
Over
$222 trillion of unfunded Federal entitlement liabilities
-
Over $5 trillion of unfunded State
entitlement liabilities
-
True unemployment above
20%.
-
True inflation above
5%.
-
A stock market at the same level as
1999, with a 10 year expected annual return of less than 4% - Stocks
for the really, really long run. 10 year bond returns of 0% will be
a miracle.
-
A savings rate of 3.7% and with
Bernanke's ZIRP, no incentive to save. Real hourly earnings continue
to fall.
-
Baby Boomers within 10 years of
retirement have saved an average of only $78,000, and more than a
third of them have less than $25,000. More than half of U.S. workers
have no retirement plan at all.
-
A crumbling, decaying infrastructure,
with 150,000 structurally deficient bridges, bursting water mains,
and an overstressed electrical grid.
-
Horrific government public education
producing millions of low functioning morons.
-
Rotting social fabric, with 40% of
children born out of wedlock (72% of black children) and a 50%
divorce rate.
-
An energy policy based upon unicorns
farting rainbows and press releases about green energy and the
miracle of shale fracking, as average gas prices in 2012 and 2011
were the highest in U.S. history.
As the pitiful excuses for statesmen
in
Washington D.C. pander and posture about the dreaded fiscal cliff which was
purposely created by the oligarchs as a show for the masses, none of the
true issues above are being addressed.
The dramatic compromise that will ultimately be
reached between the equally corrupt parties will be hailed by the corporate
media and Wall Street shysters and an HFT supercomputer engineered stock
market rally will ensue. The cowardice of these politicians is revolting.
As Huxley knew in 1958, politicians and
propagandists prefer nonsense and storylines to truth, knowledge and
honesty.
"Human
beings act in a great variety of irrational ways, but all of them seem to be
capable, if given a fair chance, of making a reasonable choice in the light
of available evidence. Democratic institutions can be made to work only if
all concerned do their best to impart knowledge and to encourage
rationality.
But today,
in the world's most powerful democracy, the politicians and the
propagandists prefer to make nonsense of democratic procedures by appealing
almost exclusively to the ignorance and irrationality of the electors."
Aldous Huxley -
Brave New World Revisited
We want to be lied to because the truth is too
painful.
Hope and denial with a dash of delusion is the
recipe the mindless masses prefer. The average person doesn't want to
understand the chart below. They want to believe the U.S. will dominate
economically and lead the world for decades to come. We are still the bright
shining beacon of democracy on the mountaintop. Even though the facts
unequivocally reveal a declining empire, the masses desperately grasp at
straws in the wind.
The United States share of world GDP will be
vastly lower in 2021, as the hubris of declining empires never allows them
to take the necessary steps to reverse the decline (Rome, Great Britain).
It is fitting that during this magical Christmas
season of fantasy, delusion, debt fueled material over-consumption and fairy
tales, we look at the biggest fairy tale of all - the great jobs recovery.
I know from the two thousand Obama campaign
commercials I was forced to watch in the last few months and 500 robo-calls
at dinner every night that we've added 4 million jobs due to
Obama's
wise
economic policies.
The magical journey from a 10.3% unemployment rate to a
7.9% rate is a humdinger.
I stumbled across a myriad of charts on those
truth-telling websites that I had previously mentioned.
"You
shall know the truth and the truth shall make you mad."
Aldous Huxley - The Doors Of Perception: Heaven and
Hell
The first chart that grabbed my attention shows
the historical relationship between the U3 unemployment rate reported to the
masses versus the U6 truer picture of unemployment, along with the
percentage of people unemployed for longer than 15 weeks.
A funny thing happened shortly after the
election of Barack Obama.
From 1994 through 2008 the gap between the U3 and
U6 rates consistently ranged between 3% and 4%. Suddenly, the gap surged to
7% and currently sits at almost 8%.
The figure reported to the masses of 7.9% is so
much easier to digest than the 15% to 17% that captures the truer level of
unemployment. If the gap between these two figures had remained at the
levels of the previous 14 years, the unemployment that should be reported to
the masses would be 11%.
That is unacceptable to those in power, so the
data is massaged and the propaganda machine spins the storyline necessary to
confuse and mislead the masses.
The next two charts from Mike Shedlock
again reveal truths the existing social order doesn't want you to know.
Even though the working age population has grown
by 10 million people since 2008, the BLS expects critical thinking people to
believe the labor force has only grown by 1.3 million people. You see, the
unemployment rate is calculated using the labor force. If your economic
policies don't create jobs, just adjust the labor force dramatically lower
based on nothing. In desperate economic times, people do not voluntarily
leave the workforce.
Only a non-thinking drone would believe that 8.7
million Americans voluntarily left the workforce since 2008, when only 4
million left the workforce from 2003 through 2007. It is not a coincidence
that student loan debt, which was taken over by the Obama administration in
2009 rose by $300 billion.
Those in power have doled out these billions
with no concern for credit risk or academic credentials in order to reduce
the number of people in the labor force.
Unemployed union Twinkie workers
seeking a new career in lesbian studies can get a $20,000 loan from the
American taxpayer to sit in their basement along with the 500,000 other
University of Phoenix enrollees.
The future $300 billion taxpayer bailout
was worth it to keep the unemployment rate low enough to insure Obama's
re-election.
The Obama PR machine never fails to expound upon
the fact that the economy added 4.9 million jobs since January 2009.
In the
same timeframe, uncovered employment rose by 6.6 million.
Inquiring minds
might want to know what an "uncovered" job entails.
-
Selling your accumulated Chinese crap on Ebay is
an uncovered job
-
Calling yourself a consultant while sleeping until noon is
an uncovered job
-
Day trading Facebook and Apple stock is an uncovered job
-
Trash picking is an uncovered job
The truth is that real jobs are 1.7
million lower than they were at the depths of the recession, while bullshit
jobs paying virtually nothing and offering no benefits have surged by 6.6
million.
These facts don't make a great campaign
commercial.
The number of employed Americans is at the same level as
mid-2005, even though the working age population has grown by 18 million.
Since 2008 there are 3 million less full-time jobs and 3 more part-time
jobs.
This trend is accelerating as small businesses
react rationally to the oncoming Obamacare train, resulting in aggregate
work hours declining and wage growth stagnating.
Zero Hedge reveals more truth about our glorious
jobs recovery with the following two charts.
They obliterate the false narrative spun by
liberal ideologues that the reason for the increase of those not in the
labor force is due to Baby Boomers retiring. The truth is that while those
in the 55-69 age brackets have gained nearly 4 million jobs under President
Obama, everyone else has lost just over 2.5 million jobs.
Is this a positive development or a sign of
extreme desperation among older Americans who have seen their interest
income vaporized by Ben Bernanke and there food, energy, and healthcare
expenses skyrocket?
Those in their prime earning years of 25 to 54
still have a net cumulative loss of 2.2 million jobs since 2009.
Recent college graduates, with their billions of
student loan debt, have nabbed 400,000
TGI Fridays jobs, singing happy
birthday to 3 year olds, with their newly minted college degrees.
This is the "normal" healthy jobs market sold to
the American public by the propagandists and politicians.
The final jobs chart that portrays the truth of
what has been a decades' long spiral downward paints a picture of a country
that once created wealth through producing goods from the 1940s through
1970.
Since 1970 we've degenerated into a debt
creating country that consumes foreign produced goods and makes entitlement
promises it can never keep. Selling houses to each other, peddling crap on
Ebay, and eating out three times a week has shockingly failed to propel our
economy.
The jobs picture has deteriorated rapidly since 2008 and is not
improving, despite the best propaganda money can buy.
There is absolutely no chance of any substantive
improvement over the next four years based on the policies in place and
refusal to acknowledge the economic realities that we face.
The accumulation of material possessions through
the use of consumer debt, peddled by bankers and reinforced through
relentless corporate marketing propaganda has left the country's citizens
weary, miserable, greedy, indebted and sick.
Our obsession with technology has merely
provided another means of distracting ourselves from confronting the dire
challenges that must be addressed. We can ignore the facts but that doesn't
mean they do not exist.
The abnormality that grips this nation is
breathtaking to behold, as the status quo cheer on and encourage consumers
to buy more things with money they don't have in order to support an
economic recovery that is dependent upon zero interest rates for Wall Street
banks, QE to infinity, and the delusional desire for a miraculous return to
the good old days when getting something for nothing was possible.
We can no
longer deny reality.
If we want to add 30 million people to Medicaid, it
must be paid for. If we want to wage never ending wars and police the world,
it must be paid for. If we want a Federal government to spend $3.8 trillion
per year, it must be paid for.
Nothing is free in this world, but more than 50%
of Americans seem to believe that to be true.
"Our
economy is based on spending billions to persuade people that happiness is
buying things, and then insisting that the only way to have a viable economy
is to make things for people to buy so they'll have jobs and get enough
money to buy things."
Philip Elliot Slater
We are seen by those in control as nothing more
than common house flies caught in their web of lies.
Your owners don't care about you. They only care
about their own wealth and power. They want to control and manipulate you.
They want to keep you enslaved in debt and running on the treadmill of
consumption. They want passive, non-critical thinking drones to do the
menial service jobs that remain in this country, while they use their
control of our financial, political, tax, and legal systems to ransack and
pillage the wealth of the dwindling middle class.
The truth is the
continuation of our current economic system is mathematically impossible.
Your owners know this.
This is why the use of propaganda, misinformation,
fake data, and false storylines has taken on astronomical proportions. The
time for passivity and accepting the deceitfulness of our leaders is coming
to an end.
While you're waiting in line this Christmas season at Wal-Mart to
purchase a fabulously priced shirt that only required the deaths of 112
Bangladesh slave laborers, try to figure out how we got here.
Your owners think they have you by the balls.
"They spend
billions of dollars every year lobbying to get what they want.
Well, we know
what they want; they want more for themselves and less for everybody else.
But I'll tell you what they don't want - they don't want a population of
citizens capable of critical thinking.
They don't
want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking.
They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against their
interest. You know something, they don't want people that are smart enough
to sit around their kitchen table and figure out how badly they're getting
fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago.
Because the
owners of this country know the truth, it's called the American Dream,
because you have to be asleep to believe it."
George Carlin
How many Americans are awake enough to handle
the truth?
All I want for Christmas is the truth.
