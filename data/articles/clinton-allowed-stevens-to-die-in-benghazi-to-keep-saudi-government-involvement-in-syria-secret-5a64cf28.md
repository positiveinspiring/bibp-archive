Despite the assertions of the US State
Department, witnesses to the attack at the rented villa in Benghazi where US
Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was murdered say that al-Qaeda was not
present.
Obama, using the premeditated incident for
political gain, and attempting to fool the American public, first said that
the assault was the work of terrorism and subsequent revolts against US
Embassies worldwide were caused by the 14 minute trailer of an anti-Muslim
film that was produced by the US and written and directed by an FBI
informant.
On September 15th, Obama stated in his
weekly address that the US,
must also send a clear and resolute message to
the world: those who attack our people will find no escape from justice.
The filmmaker, FBI informant Nakoula Basseley
Nakoula, a.k.a. Sam Bacile, was imprisoned in 2009 for banking fraud, he was
employed as an informant for the FBI just before he was used as a pasty
in the making of the film Innocence of Muslims that the US government is
claiming they had no hand in producing.
In order to cover their tracks, and
facilitate the psy-op that convinces the American public that Islam and
al-Qaeda are legitimate terrorists.
Anonymous US officials are stating that the
attackers were ill-planned, disorganized and did not have weapons. It is
said that they were looters looking to steal something of value from the
scene of the crime.
The landlord of the villa rented by the US State
Department, Mohammad al-Bishari,
stated that the was burned down after Stevens and Sean Smith, an
employee of the US State Department and
Hillary Clinton since 2009 were
murdered along with 2 US Marines.
Just days before Stevens and his entourage
arrived in Benghazi the employees at the villa were flown to the
actual US Embassy in Tripoli; with
some being flown to undisclosed locations in Europe.
Bashri
confirms that the men who attacked the villa, threw grenades over the
walls, shoot and killed the US Marines who tried to defend Stevens; then
looted and stole sensitive documents containing the names of Libyans working
with the US and the Saudi Arabian government in terroristic operations, as
well as oil contracts tying the US and Saudi Arabia, and burned it to the
ground after murdering Stevens.
The assailants were armed with American
assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and carried the black flag of the Ansar al-Sharia, or the Partisans of Sharia (PoS).
Sheik Mohamed Oraibi, an Islamic preacher who
arrived on the scene soon after the attack began also
says that many were carrying weapons.
Oraibi went on to explain that
the attackers came in 20 pickup trucks will mounted machine guns. More
witnesses have also reaffirmed that the attackers were heavily armed and
Libyan citizens.
The anonymous US official claimed that there was
no credible intelligence that the attackers pre-planned their assault days
or weeks in advance.
However, House Representative Mike Rogers,
chairman of the House Intelligence Committee stated that
there is evidence that this was a,
well-armed, well-coordinated event.
It had both indirect and direct fire, and it had military maneuvers that
were all part of this very organized attack.
To confuse the issue more and divert the truth
of the matter which resulted in the death of Stevens and 3 others is a meme
recently propagated by suspicious sources that Obama had planned to trade
the Blind Sheik for Stevens after a faked kidnapping.
The story touts
Obamas desire to recreate former US President Jimmy Carters success and
ultimate sympathy gained by the American public for the Iranian hostage
crisis.
This redirection has made its way to Republican
nominee Mitt Romney who
stated about the false story that,
I - I think the president just said
correctly that - that the buck does stop at his desk... and - and he
takes responsibility for - for that - for that - the failure in providing
those security resources, and those terrible things may well happen from
time to time.
Being called Benghazi-gate, this hit turned
terroristic event is further being shrouded in propaganda to keep the truth
from the American public.
Stevens diplomatic mission in Benghazi
consisted of surveillance work and intelligence gathering in
conjunction with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on the inner
workings of the National Transitional Council (NTC) and the use of militant
extremist cells by this deface-government installed by the US in Libya after
the assassination of Gadhafi in 2010.
In fact, when the attack on the villa
in Benghazi occurred, it posed a problem for the CIA who evacuated their
operatives and contractors from the area prior to the attack.
At one point,
Stevens met with the PoS in Benghazi, while staying at the gated-villa when
talking with the NTC.
During his time meeting with the NTC in Benghazi
(where their headquarters are located) Stevens negotiated arms deals with
the terrorist organization. Because of Stevens involvement with the
extremist faction the PoS, his dealings with the NTC and his surveillance
operations with the CIA, he became a sitting duck when he travelled to
Benghazi to stay at the villa.
Some of Stevens
deals for arms can be realized in the artillery and weapons being
funneled to the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in Syria who are fighting the proxy
war for the US. Stevens became the "liaison" between US-sponsored terrorist factions and the movement of
arms to Syria to assist the FSA. And this is the reason Stevens was
murdered.
Recent shipments to the FSA have come from Saudi
Arabia where the Salafi terrorists originated and the PoS is used to further
subversive interests. Thanks to the US, the Saudi government and Stevens,
the FSA are the
most heavily armed state-sponsored jihadist group in the Middle East.
The Brookings Institute, a globalist think-tank
said that the,
FSA could defeat Syrias armed forces and conquer the
country, or it could continue to gain strength and dishearten regime
stalwarts, leading to mass defections or even a coup that causes the regime
to collapse.
The FSA would then become the new Syrian army, subordinate to
an elected Syrian government, with the mission of ensuring the country
remains stable and has protected borders.
They go on to praise this fact and confirm that
it is the hope of the globalists that despite a year of violence, their
terrorist group will divide the Assad government and all other opposition.
The Brookings Institute suggests that the,
United States were to embrace the
policy of arming the opposition; a key initial step would be to make the
opposition more coherent.
The US has
covertly employed former
Blackwater mercenaries and certain members of
the CIA to aid the FSA in their mission to topple the Syrian government.
Stevens was concerned about being on a
terroristic hit-list and worried that the PoS may be planning his death.
He
contacted the US State Department and called for more security.
Hillary
Clinton, Secretary of State, and responsible for
diplomatic security,
denied Stevens request. And in response, there was an order from the US
government to disarm the US Marine Security by refusing them live ammo while
allowing them to keep their guns.
Clinton, not wanting the Saudi connection to
become common knowledge, and knowing that Stevens was directly involved in
arms trade deals between the NTC and the Saudi government to arm the FSA in
Syria paved the way for the US Ambassador to be murdered.
The FSA are comprised of
Salafi extremists sent from Saudi Arabia to fight against the Assad
government for the benefit of the US. They are also the same terrorists that
attacked the villa where US Ambassador Stevens was murdered is in Syria
fighting the proxy war for the US.
The Salafi terrorist cells are given
different names depending on their location geographically (such as
al-Qaeda, FSA, etc...) so that the idea that they are separate is
purveyed to the general public. However, they are subscribing to an extreme
form of Islam that is encompassing in Saudi Arabia.
The Salafis being used in Syria are
exceptionally violent and adhere to sectarianism with complete
abhorrence for the US. This ideal is fostered because it helps to facilitate
the psychological mindset necessary for manipulation.
Two weeks ago it was
confirmed
that the FSA are being armed by Saudi Arabia. The attack in Aleppo was
actually funded with ammunition and weaponry from the US-aligned Middle
Eastern nation.
The FSA denies knowledge of how they came to obtain this
shipment from Saudi Arabia; however it is fairly obvious that the Salafi
extremists in their country are supporting the US-backed terrorist faction.
Saudi officials have also declined comment thinking that refusal to speak
will correspond with their ignorance.
Yet, Saudi ammunition has been used
since the inception of the CIA-trained rebels paid for by foreign aid
from the US and British governments.
