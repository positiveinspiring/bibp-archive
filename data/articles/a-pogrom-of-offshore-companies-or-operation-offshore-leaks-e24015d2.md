From the beginning of April this year, the subject of "Offshore
Leaks" has
become a favorite with the world's media. Even the issue of Cyprus has paled
in significance.
Loosely speaking, "Offshore leaks" can be
defined as the leakage of sensitive information about offshore companies and
their clients.
Offshore leaks is a
planned operation
We are talking about a planned operation on a global scale.
On 4 April, the leading media companies of a
variety of countries almost simultaneously issued a sensational news story
claiming that an organization called the International Consortium of
Investigative Journalists (ICIJ
or
CPI) has a rich database on offshore
companies and their clients.
The overall volume of files at ICIJ's disposal
exceeds 260 gigabytes
That is 160 times more information than the embassy
reports made public
by Wikileaks in 2010...
The ICIJ files consist of more than 2.5 million
documents:
-
the registration data of 122,000
offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands
-
lists of people who have made use of
offshore companies
-
copies of personal documents including
passports
-
correspondence
-
information on banking transactions and
other databases related to world-class politicians and businessmen,
major companies and banks
The documents have a variety of dates, the very
earliest of which came into existence 30 years ago.
The names of 130,000 people from 170 countries
are also mentioned in the documents.
-
The first phase of the operation involved an anonymous person collecting raw
data on offshore companies.
We do not know how long they collected the
information for or which methods were used to obtain the information. It is possible that the ICIJ and individual
journalists know the answers to these questions, but they are keeping
silent.
They give one answer: we cannot jeopardize our informant. It should
be noted, however, that it would have been practically impossible for a
single person to have obtained such a large amount of information.
Incidentally, the idea that it was a lone person has already appeared in the
press.
It is exactly the same wild assumption as the
idea that 11 September 2001 was the work of a group of terrorists under the
command of Bin Laden.
-
The second phase began in January 2012, when the database on offshore
companies was anonymously passed on to the organization ICIJ. It was a huge
array of weakly-structured and weakly-organized information.
In fact, the ICIJ then had to set about
reorganizing this half-finished information. At this stage, the ICIJ used
the media capabilities of a number of countries, as well as their own
journalists. The bulk of the work was carried out in the field. It turns out
that the project's most prominent external participants were the British
Broadcasting Corporation and the British newspaper The Guardian.
During the course of the work, journalists
involved in the project added new information to the data obtained from the
anonymous source. Programmers and IT specialists from the US, Great Britain
and Costa Rica were also involved.
At this stage, the operation was given the
official name: "Secrecy For Sale
- Inside The Global Offshore Money Maze".
At this point, the work was not only not hidden,
it was even advertised in the media. At the end of 2012, a tiny fragment
from the database on offshore companies (DOC) was published which related to
a dozen offshore companies and their management structures. It was an
all-powerful delayed-action mine.
-
The third stage began early in April 2013.
Separate fragments of the
database were made public through the media of a variety of countries. In
each country, there were several "authorized" media companies that were
selected. In Russia, for example, the "authorized" media companies were Vedomosti and Novaya Gazeta.
It is remarkable that as the organization
holding the DOC, the ICIJ prohibited those national media companies that had
use of the DOC from passing on any of the database's documents to
law-enforcement agencies or other authoritative bodies in their own
countries.
Apparently, there is a risk that their informants could be
exposed.
There has already been a report that the German
media refused to provide information on local tax evaders mentioned in the
documents released at the beginning of April to the appropriate authorities
of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The third stage, involving the measured release of information from the DOC,
could last for many years.
However, the first sections of this "explosive
information" could already lead to a revolutionary upheaval of the current
world order.
Offshore leaks -
goals, aims and motives
Many people are asking a simple question: what are the operation's goals?
There is the official goal referred to by the
ICIJ, of course. This is the battle with offshore companies that have become
a "black hole" in the economy, an insurmountable obstacle to social and
economic development. It is difficult to dispute the fact that the process
of the "offshorization" of the global economy has gone too far.
The most recent valuations of the assets hidden
in the shadows of offshore companies are between 21 and 32 trillion dollars
(almost double the global GDP).
Measured on a global scale, annual losses to
state budgets alone as a result of offshore company clients avoiding taxes
amount to hundreds of billions of dollars. As of 2011, losses to the US
budget from the non-payment of taxes are estimated at 345 billion dollars,
including 100 billion dollars as a result of tax evaders using offshore
companies.
In the European Union, losses are reaching 1
trillion Euros through the use of tax optimization schemes and a flagrant
refusal to pay taxes.
It is not known how much of this can be put down to
the use of offshore companies, however. On the basis of America's percentage
ratio, we get 290 billion Euros, or at least 350 billion dollars.
Altogether, annual tax losses to the EU and the US as a result of offshore
"loopholes" amount to nearly 450 billion dollars.
Many believe that the battle with offshore companies is just an excuse to
cover up other aims.
An overview of the world's media shows that in
many of the reports, the main targets are not the offshore companies as
such, but individual oligarchs, politicians and government officials.
Individual countries are also cited as "targets".
World-renowned banks, transnational corporations
and financial groups are also sometimes cited.
One theory behind the operation's true motives is that it is specifically
aimed at dealing a blow to certain offshore companies in order to outrun the
money and clients in a small group of "select" and "untouchable" offshore
companies.
Note that almost all of the documents in the DOC relate to an
offshore territory called the British Virgin Islands (BVI).
Owing to a high level of confidentiality
regarding information on company owners, this area is one of the most
reliable and popular offshore territories.
Since 1984, when the British overseas territory
declared itself a "tax haven", the islands have sold more than one million
companies, the true owners of which have never been revealed. As well as the
BVI, other offshore territories are mentioned in the ICIJ press release,
including,
-
Singapore
-
Hong Kong
-
the Cook Islands
However, it should be emphasized that they are
mentioned only insofar as they serve as "offshoots" of the British Virgin
Islands.
There are also other theories behind the operation's true goals: not to
"blitz" a particular offshore company, but to stabilize the global economy
as a whole, to cause a political crisis in certain countries and,
ultimately, to move the world into a state of controlled chaos.
Moreover, the operation "Offshore
Leaks" is not
regarded as self-contained, but as part of a much larger, global plan. In
which case, operation "Offshore Leaks" is a logical continuation of the
operation to undermine the banking system of the offshore island of Cyprus.
Of course, one can only judge the aims of operation "Offshore Leaks"
hypothetically.
The most important organization involved in the
project, ICIJ, itself raises a number of questions. There is little
information about it. All that is known is that it was established in 1997,
its headquarters are situated in Washington and it includes nearly 160
journalists from 60 countries (88 journalists from 46 countries were
involved in operation "Offshore Leaks").
ICIJ was created as a project of the large
non-profit organization Center for Public Integrity (CPI). The Knight
Foundation, the Ford Foundation and
George Soros all act as sponsors of CPI.
All of this inclines one to think that the
operation really does have global aims.
The central characters
of "Offshore leaks"
In the first batch of materials published in the media, we see all kinds of
people.
They are able to appear in the documents under a
variety of titles: beneficiary, shareholder, proprietor, owner, recipient of
"trust services", director, owner, co-owner, principal etc. They are all
nevertheless united by the fact that they are "tax evaders".
The list includes the names of politicians and
government officials, businessmen and speculators, members of wealthy
families and bankers from a variety of countries:
-
the USA
-
Great Britain
-
France
-
Canada
-
Germany
-
Russia
-
the Ukraine
-
Mongolia
-
Azerbaijan
-
Venezuela
-
Iran
-
Indonesia
-
India
-
the Philippines
The Guardian points out that according to the
documentation, the largest number of offshore company owners are located in,
-
China
-
Hong Kong
-
Taiwan
-
the Russian Federation
-
former Soviet republics
The list also includes the names of 4,000 US
citizens.
In connection with the offshore scandal, a number of people have had their
cover blown in the press, including:
-
the campaign treasurer for French
President François Hollande, Jean-Jacques Augier
-
Mongolia's former Finance minister,
Bayartsogt Sangajav
-
Venezuela Army General José Eliécer
Pinto Gutiérrez
-
two sons of former Colombian president
Álvaro Uribe, Tomás and Geronimo
-
the daughter of former Philippine
president Ferdinand Marcos, Maria Imelda Marcos Manotoc
-
the Sheikh of Kuwait Sabah Jaber al-Ali
al-Sabah
-
a leading art collector, Spanish
Baroness Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza
-
the former wife of oil trader Marc Rich,
Denise Rich
-
British millionaire Scot Young, who has
been convicted of fraud
The media also mentioned,
-
Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev along
with members of his family
-
Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina
Ivanishvili
-
Kazakh businessman Mukhtar Ablyazov, and
co-owner of the company RosUkrEnergo
-
Ukrainian businessman Dmitry Firtash
As well as offshore companies and individuals,
the documents also mentioned various intermediaries who act like a kind of
"pilot" for individuals and companies who find themselves in the intricate
maze of tax havens.
The different intermediaries include legal
firms, trust funds, banks, "construction" companies and so on. The
intermediaries sometimes act as beneficiaries, but only interim ones. These
interim beneficiaries sometimes form complex chains in order to safely keep
the real owner, the ultimate beneficiary, a secret.
As for the role of banks in offshore schemes,
-
the German banking giant Deutsche Bank
-
the American company JP Morgan
-
the Swiss companies UBS and Clariden,
...are the most active, according to ICIJ.
Several days have passed since the first volley of gunfire from "Offshore
leaks". Government and political figures in a number of countries have had
time to respond.
The internal revenue services and
law-enforcement agencies in,
-
Germany
-
Great Britain
-
Belgium
-
India
-
Greece,
...have declared that they will be looking into
the issue of checking the published facts that relate to their own citizens.
Luxembourg's finance minister, meanwhile, has
declared that he is ready to cooperate with other EU countries regarding the
exchange of information on banks' clients who are avoiding paying taxes.
This means that the main country for offshore
banking in continental Europe has made it clear it is ready, on the heels of
Switzerland, to begin dismantling its institution of banking secrecy.
The
Austrian government is the only one that has decided to go against the flow. It has appeased the clients of Austrian banks by
announcing that it does not intend to hand them over to the tax authorities
of other countries.
