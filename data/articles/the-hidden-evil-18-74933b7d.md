Tactics (Part 2)
Setups and Confrontations
Informants have apparently been used to frame targets for crimes or to
participate in staged events which foster character assassination. A person
may not be aware of some of these setups. Some staged events may include
people provoking targets into confrontations. McKinney wrote about
"Recurrent confrontations by unusually hostile strangers." "Seemingly
homeless people who are well-dressed and very clean will get into
confrontations with targets... and create big public scenes," warned Moret.
McKinney described an episode involving a male target who spoke with a woman
who had often paced in the apartment above. After he spoke with her about
this pacing, which occurred even during her absence, she "immediately
complained to the building manager that he was stalking her," wrote
McKinney. "She conveniently forgot to inform the building manager that she
had assiduously 'courted' this individual for several months, without
success; and that she had been stealing his newspapers on a regular basis."
Presumably, these setups and staged confrontations are done to get targeted
people into the penal or mental health system. At the very least they can
aid with recruitment. Also, photos, or video footage taken of an enraged
target after they have been antagonized (setup), may also assist with a
smear campaign when leveraging support of the community to facilitate the
removal of the target. Multiple complaints filed independently which entail
the same report may also achieve this.
Reportedly, local police participate in stalking and have framed people for
crimes. Referring to one target's repeated encounters with a police officer,
McKinney wrote, "One of his recent acts was to 'frame' her with a drug
possession charge. After pulling her off the road (a frequent pastime) and
subjecting her to an illegal search (done, twice, so far), he conveniently
managed to find a glassine packet of cocaine eight feet away, in front of
his squat car."
Similarly, during the former Cointelpro, there were routine setups, and
fabricating of evidence used to destroy a person's character or have them
imprisoned. But this obviously hasn't stopped. According to the December 7th
2003 issue of the Sunday Herald, the FBI is on record using multiple
informants to frame innocent people for crimes by having informants commit
perjury. This can be done legally in the interest of "national security."
The article sited a 141-page report by the House Committee on Government
Reform, which stated that the FBI rigged evidence, and used informants to
provide "false testimony," so that innocent people would be imprisoned.
Oddly enough, some of these informants were murderers!
"Well over 20 murders were committed by FBI informants," the report
revealed, and to protect them federal law enforcement "actively worked to
prevent homicide cases [from] being resolved." The committee also concluded
that "officials in FBI Director J Edgar Hoover's office were well aware that
federal informants were committing murders." The article continued quoting
Judge Nancy Gertner saying, "It is hard to conceive of accusations that
shake the legal system closer to its foundation that would do more to
challenge this nation's most basic assumptions of honesty, fairness, and
trust in the administration of justice." She added, "All in the name of
'national security.'"
In his book, The Franklin Cover-up, former Senator John Decamp wrote, "In
case after notorious case entirely unrelated to Franklin, Justice Department
[DOJ] personnel appear as liars, perverts, frame-up artists, and even -
assassins." Apparently Senator DeCamp experienced significant turbulence
while investigating a child sex ring which included prominent individuals in
Washington D.C. According to DeCamp, the elite used the FBI to orchestrate
the cover-up.
Stores and Restaurants
Store and restaurant staff work in tandem with citizen informants to harass
targets. Wait-staff in restaurants will be rude or give targets bad service.
Or they may appear to be friendly as they stick their elbows in a targeted
person's face, repeatedly kick their chair, or crowd them while taking an
order or delivering food. They will also mess-up orders, and appear clumsy
or incompetent by accidentally dropping food or silverware on targeted
people.
If you're targeted and make a trip to the bathroom, you will be cutoff by
wait-staff who appear from around corners or through doors. Plain-clothed
citizens will be assisting them in the harassment as they crowd you while
you walk to and from your table. They'll also follow you into the bathroom
where they will crowd you or appear to be talking to someone on their cell
phone while parroting information about your personal life.
In restaurants, these citizens will be seated around the target, wearing a
color that he or she has been sensitized to. They may very well have
conversations which contain specific information about the target's personal
life. This is obviously a very empowering trip for some of them. This seems
to be done, both to harass targets and to try to evoke a sense of
helplessness in them by not being believed if they were to tell someone
about the harassment.
Similar to restaurant staff, store clerks work with citizen informants in
their store to crowd, block and cut targets off. They may engage in
conversations with citizen informants at the checkout line or in the isles
as a target walks by, which are obviously intended to be overheard, and
contain information about a target's personal life. A variation of these
tactics were used in East Germany, where the Stasi would co-opt a business
owner to utter some words in the presence of a targeted customer, in order
to let him know that they had been expecting him.
Stores and restaurants also participate in noise campaigns by banging
merchandise on shelves as they put it away, throwing boxes on the floor as
targets pass by, door slamming, slamming items on counters, and other types
of commotion. If there are low ceilings, there may be banging directly above
the target which will also follow them around the store. The Noise Campaigns
and Street Theatre are apparently intended to create a cloaked hostile
environment to persuade the target to leave, and let them know they're being
watched.
Also, specific products that a target shops for may be sold out in the
stores that they frequent. Apparently they are removed from the shelves
prior to the target's arrival. In addition, if targets purchase products
from vendors over the phone or online they will frequently encounter
representatives who don't return calls, appear vague, or incompetent.
Generally, targets will receive poor service. These things happen to all of
us, but for targets it is recurrent.
Friends and Family
If you're targeted, friends and
family may be recruited to break you down. They may participate in
harassment skits intended to make you look incompetent, inconsistent,
hypocritical, and to mock and demoralize you. The methods used to recruit
friends and family will be covered in the Informants section.
New friends, may be used in an attempt to do the same. "A number of
individuals in touch with us report a range of experiences with new
'friends,'" wrote McKinney. These 'friends' pose as confidants and abruptly
end these 'friendships' under deliberately degrading and humiliating
circumstances. She added, "When taken in the context of the ongoing
surveillances and harassment, these exercises appear intended to heighten
emotional trauma, perhaps to provoke an uncontrolled response and/or to
enforce isolation."
If you're targeted and live with someone who has been co-opted, perhaps a
friend or family member, they will probably be forced to carry out some of
these harassment tactics. At home they may frequently slam doors, cabinets,
draws, and make other types of noises. They may frequently crowd or block
you. Areas that you commonly occupy, or spaces normally used, will be
littered with objects (blocking), that you have been sensitized to.
Frequently used pathways will also be blocked. Traps may be set, such as
items frequently falling out of freezers or cabinets as you open them. Phone
conversations which occur while you're present will be loud and contain
information about your personal life. Out in public, these friends or family
members may be forced by their handlers to guide you through and participate
in Street Theatre, where they will interact with other citizen informants to
harass you. These skits will be intended to make you feel foolish,
incompetent, or inconsistent.
Thefts and Break-ins
When break-ins occur there is usually
no sign of forced entry, and they occur when the target is sleeping or
elsewhere. This is the case even if there is a Hi-Tech security system in
place. "In virtually all such cases [investigated], the burglars leave
evidence of their visits, such as by relocating objects, or by committing
petty and not-so-petty acts of vandalism," wrote McKinney.
This happens at the home as well as the workplace if the target is fortunate
enough to be employed. Targets have reported clothing being ripped, milk,
coffee and other items poured out, and small-scale damage. Items may be
stolen and brought back at a later date, and they may move items and place
them in a slightly different spot. These are essentially Gaslighting
tactics.
Victor Santoro claims that these subtle memory games can be used to drive
people insane. Small things such as pens, shoes, and silverware are taken or
tampered with so people will seem delusional if they file a police report.
"Burglarizing your home is very, very common," stated Moret, and "a lot of
times they'll leave evidence of their visits, just little small changes in
the target's home which is noticeable." Executive Order No. 12333 states
that these break-ins can be done legally.
Interestingly enough, surreptitious break-ins, thefts, and sabotage were a
staple part of the old Cointelpro. Other tactics Santoro advocates include
filling a target's gas tank, or substituting items of his clothing with ones
a size smaller. If you're unaware that you're targeted, as most people are,
then these small changes may be attributed to a lapse in your memory. If
these tactics are used in combination with others, then as Santoro
illustrates, you may think you're going insane.
Gunderson also spoke of Gaslighting tactics, which he described as
"psychological warfare." In his personal experience with what is presumably
state-sponsored harassment, he has noticed bits of furniture and other items
being moved around during surreptitious break-ins. He states they are, "so
arrogant that they almost always leave subliminal messages of their...
entry." The logic is that a thief would never break into your home and leave
a computer or stereo and just steal a toothbrush, or pour out a portion of
your milk.
In his book, Subliminal Mind Control, John J. Williams wrote, "If you are
being subjected to a secret and involuntary subliminal experience it is a
malevolent, sinister and often dangerous attack against you that you have
every right to vigorously oppose and thwart as if you are a POW or someone
has broken into your home to rob you of what is rightfully yours." He warns,
"In fact they have broken into your mind, and are trying to rob you of your
free will. Even in cases where there is actually an intended positive
outcome."
Sabotage, Vandalism and Staged Events
Targets may regularly experience acts of vandalism. Electronic equipment may
frequently be failing. People have reported having electrical systems in
their cars, brand new appliances, TVs, radios, PCs, and other electronic
equipment suddenly die, or act strangely.
Targets may experience frequent computer trouble such as failing hardware.
Ongoing computer problems which do not follow any logical pattern may also
occur. Some of this can be attributed to the E-bomb which can destroy
electrical equipment while not damaging humans.
Many times this vandalism is usually just below what you'd report to the
police. For instance, a small but noticeable portion of your masonry has
been chipped off, and a crack has appeared in one of your windows. This may
be restricted to minor vandalism, just to let you know that you're under
surveillance. However large-scale property damage is also done to homes and
vehicles, such as slashed tires, broken windows, tampering with break lines,
and destruction of electrical equipment.
Some targets have reported that their pets die suddenly of mysterious
illness. For instance, they come home to find a perfectly healthy pet dead.
Vandalism and pets being tortured may also be in retaliation for a target
taking action to expose them.
"Automobiles are one of the biggest targets," said Moret, adding "they slash
tires, they smash the windows, drain the oil out of the cars, fool with the
electronic components and batteries." She continued, "A lot of people have
complained about breaks suddenly failing, clutches failing." McKinney agreed
writing, "Vehicles invite peculiarly ferocious attacks in these harassment
campaigns-slashed tires, smashed windows, oil drainage, oil contamination,
destruction of electronic components and batteries... grounded fuel gages"
and "suddenly failed brakes and clutches," occur. Recurrent auto thefts have
also been reported.
McKinney explained that some of those she was in contact with had
experienced staged accidents. One involved the breaks failing on a tractor
which resulted in the death of the driver. And another episode included a
person barely escaping being run off the road by an off-duty bus. "Two
others," added McKinney "narrowly avoided what appeared to be deliberately
attempted collisions by drivers who quickly sped away from the scene."
Another episode involved a targeted person who avoided three attempts in
four days at being run off the road. Still another survived being run off
the road twice within week, which resulted in a totaling of her two
vehicles. "They also conduct staged accidents where people may be forced
into accidents in their cars," echoed Moret.
So, according to this information, multiple seemingly independent vehicles
can be used to facilitate an accident which can appear to have been caused
by a targeted person. Add to this, multiple independent witnesses
(informants) and you have a recipe for murder or a framing. In fact,
"accidental" deaths have reportedly occurred. Once more, the Stasi would do
similar things. "Car brake-leads have been cut, accidents and deaths
reverse-engineered," noted Funder.
Traveling
When targets drive, they may be surrounded by vehicles driven by citizen
informants who frequently cut them off and tailgate them. Targets will
experience more tailgating and cut-offs than what would naturally occur.
Vehicles will frequently pull out past stops signs as the TI approaches an
intersection. This is apparently done to startle them.
While traveling on the highway there will be a rotation of vehicles that
surround targets. These vehicles may be marked with an identifying feature,
or a color that they've been sensitized to. This seems to function as both
an NLP tactic to trigger negative emotions which have been anchored to the
feature, as well as a method to unite the group and promote group
cohesiveness. In other words, it is similar to a uniform, or a squad car.
There will also be a rotation of people tailgating targets. These vehicles
may cut them off after they've been tailing them for a while. Apparently
this is done to imply that they weren't going fast enough. When done in a
recurrent manner by multiple vehicles, this antagonizing behavior may also
serve to encourage the target to accelerate, which may result in them
getting pulled over. This may be especially effective if they're not aware
that they're targeted.
City and state vehicles which may stalk targets in public, include: off-duty
metro buses, school buses, local restaurant delivery vehicles, city and
construction vehicles, fire trucks and ambulances, police cars, postal and
UPS vehicles, taxis, and 18 wheelers. Helicopters and small planes have also
reportedly been used to stalk people. As will be revealed in the Informants
section, many of these are vehicles belonging to organizations which have
been selected for recruitment into the citizen informant programs.
Convoys of vehicles which are all spaced the same distance and traveling at
the same speed will participate in stalking. Within this convoy, there may
be several vehicles exhibiting traits that a target has been sensitized to
with NLP. These traits are thereby symbolic of a uniform. For instance, most
or all of them will be a shade of red. Or most of them will have their
lights on, even during the daytime. Or they may have the same bumper
stickers. During the evening targets may experience frequent Brighting while
driving or walking.
Brighting
Vehicular Brighting is an attack. It seems to be strategically used with
corners. For instance, if you're targeted and you're walking down a quiet
street late at night, you'll see vehicles repeatedly turn onto or off of
connecting streets. Their timing is such that they continually turn the
corners while you are at it. This effectively blinds you. This happens
frequently at corners. Or, as you walk down a side street, there is one or
more cars parked on the side, facing your direction with the lights on. They
will also wait for you to approach them and then pull out into the street,
thereby Brighting you as you walk by.
These Brighting tactics are maximized when a vehicle has one headlight
grossly misaligned. The misalignment produces a Hi-Beaming effect. Like
other tactics, frequency and duration play an important role here. Lights
being shined into a target's windows have also been reported. "Among the
most common non-lethal weapons are bright lights," wrote Dr. Alexander, in
his book, Winning the War. He says, "The intent is to reduce risks of
injury... by temporarily hindering the eyesight of the targeted personnel."
He also wrote of the use of bright lights on targeted people in his book,
Future War.
Blacklisting
Job opportunities will be trashed. Most targeted people are unemployed. Many
would be in the street if it weren't for parents, siblings, or friends.
Targets who are employed are usually Mobbed. "Progressive financial
impoverishment, [is] brought on by termination of the individual's
employment, and compounded by expenses associated with the harassment,"
wrote McKinney.
During her investigation she concluded, "The majority of those now in
contact with the Project - educated, white-collar professionals - have lost
their jobs. Termination of employment in many of these cases involved
prefatory harassment by the employer and co-workers [Mobbing], which
coincided with the other overt forms of harassment..."
According to an article in The Christian Science Monitor entitled,
Blacklisted by the Bank, Blacklisting was originally used as a
foreign-policy tool. At some point federal organizations obviously decided
to start using it on individuals as well. Slander may play an important role
in Blacklisting. Also there are Blacklists and software packages used to
check these lists for suspected "terrorists," "threats to national
security," etc. Apparently this is a flourishing business and some
organizations are required by law to use it.
An August 2004 article entitled, The Surveillance-Industrial Complex, by the
ACLU, stated "An entire industry has sprung up to produce software that
makes it easier for companies to enforce the government's blacklists and
other mandates. An example is 'Homeland Tracker,' produced by a subsidiary
of the giant database company Choicepoint to 'help any business comply with
OFAC and USA PATRIOT Act regulations.'" The article notes that the software
has a feature called "accept and deny lists... otherwise known as
blacklists."
Federal law enforcement has sent these watch lists to corporations. They
contained the names of individuals that were not under official
investigation or wanted, but that the agency just had an interest in. We
already know that some of these agencies are targeting and harassing
citizens. Unbeknownst to many, these agencies are apparently deliberately
destroying careers on a massive scale. Wired NewsWire spoke of these
Blacklists on August 9, 2004, in an article entitled, Big Business Becoming
Big Brother. The article concluded, "There is no way to determine how many
job applicants might have been denied work because their names appeared on
the list."
A form of Blacklisting has also been used on Russian dissidents by the
state. In his book, The Persecutor, Sergei Kourdakov, a member of the
plain-clothed People's Brigade declared, once a person was targeted, they
were "treated like a leper and could only get the worst jobs."(*) To
accomplish this Blacklisting, the USSR used something called a workbook. The
workbook was used to advance or destroy careers. If you were cooperative
with the state, your career could be very successful. If not, you would live
in poverty.
In East Germany dissidents were Blacklisted as well, and their careers were
destroyed. After the wall came down they were allowed to inspect their
files, and learned why they were unable to get jobs or enter into
universities. Dr. Munzert, speaks of the similarity between what is now
happening and what the occurred in Germany; he says the goal is "to bring
their finances down," by making them "loose their job." Your "financial
state is destroyed," added Moret.
If you've previously been Mobbed out of employment and are Blacklisted, the
Mobbing may continue during interviews. Presumably, this is used to further
traumatize you. For instance, if you're targeted, they may ask you a series
of questions for which you have to answer "no" to, such as asking you for
credentials that you did not list on your resume. They may ask you if you
possess skill-sets which were not listed on the AD they had placed. These
Mobbing tactics are apparently designed to humiliate you. These things
happen to everyone... once in a while. There is basically a "safe zone" that
these people can harass you from with little fear of being caught.
Interview questions may be asked with accusing, or mocking tones. Questions
may also be asked using certain key words, regarding the environment you
just left, which only you and your former co-workers (who Mobbed you) would
know. These questions are obviously designed to trigger negative emotions
which have been linked to a previously painful work environment, where you
experienced Mobbing. They may ask these questions over and over using a
slightly different syntax.
If you're targeted, during an interview you may have potential employers
demanding credentials that they did not list as a requirement in their AD.
During phone interviews you may have employers telling you that you
responded to an AD other than the one that you actually responded to. They
may also tell you that they did not place the AD, or that they placed a
slightly different one. You may be told that your updated resume says you're
currently working at a place that you never worked at, or a place you worked
at a decade ago.
The harassment is masked in layers of accommodation to help strengthen the
illusion that you're not working because you don't choose to. For instance,
you may have recruiters who have harassed you in the past leave messages on
your answering machine or with relatives/friends, indicating that there are
opportunities available to you. It will be made to look as if you're
unemployed due to your choice. The general public may not realize that
Blacklisting exists because the institutions that use it operate most major
news outlets. Reporters and historians are also Blacklisted for reporting
corruption or historical facts that the government-corporate complex does
not want the public to be aware of.
Publishers Weekly, gives an editorial review on Amazon.com of a book
entitled, Into the Buzzsaw, authored by Kristina Borjesson, in which they
state, "The buzzsaw is what can rip through you when you try to investigate
or expose anything this country's large institutions be they corporate or
government want kept under wraps." This "buzzsaw" is what others have called
the Invisible Government. The review continues, "Reporters who tattle risk
losing their jobs and being blacklisted... [by] concerted corporate and/or
government efforts to kill their controversial stories and their careers."
Communications Interference
Targets experience tampering or lost mail. The target's "mail is
intercepted," said Moret. There's theft and tampering." During the former
version of Cointelpro, they would blatantly watch homes, follow cars, and
open mail. The idea was to get as much info as possible to aid in the
harassment and intimidation of their targets.
The Stasi too, "inspected all mail in secret rooms above post office,"
described Funder, "and intercepted, daily, tens of thousands of phone
calls." Dr. Munzert noted that one objective of those running this program
is to "disrupt the communication systems of the victims." McKinney and Moret
state that targets usually receive lots of harassing telephone calls. These
pranks may be linked to an event unfolding in the target's personal life.
The phone has historically been an excellent harassment tool.
Online
Targets may also be stalked online. Search engine results may be filtered
(blocked) and replaced with information in a target's personal life.
Websites that a target visits may be spoofed and contain information which
is apparently intended to let the target know they're being stalked in the
internet as well. This appears to be simply an online version of the public
stalking. If you have a website devoted to exposing this program, you may
have people emailing you to flame you, or claiming that they are victims and
asking for support while making references to subjects unfolding in your
personal life. This tactic may be used to foster a sense of hopelessness and
isolation, (i.e., you're the only one).
If you're targeted, you may receive "unsolicited" email that parallels a
current event in your life. Or you may receive covert insults and threats.
If you join a support group, you may also receive harassment via threads
posted on message boards. Like other mediums of harassment, the topics of
these threads may be about events that are unfolding in your personal life,
as well as threats or insults covertly directed at you.
Your email may be blocked or filtered and your web activity may be
monitored. Carnivore, DCS1000, or similar tracking software can accomplish
some of this.(**) If you try to sell things online, participate in online
discussions groups, or respond to employment Ads, you will probably be
interrupted, trashed, or harassed.
Some people have reported that their inbox is clogged with junk messages
even if they have filters on. These unsolicited emails may contain cryptic
borderline-subliminal attacks. The words will be garbled but contain letters
that convey a message when arranged in the correct order. Or they may
contain a sounds like message. Your mind will automatically piece these
letters together so they make sense. This is done on the fly, without you
being aware of it.
These messages may contain junk in the body and the TI may not be able to
reply to it because it came from a bogus address. These cryptic attacks are
mentioned in the book, Subliminal Mind Control, by John J. Williams. If
you're targeted, the message will probably pertain to something in your life
situation. Any weakness you have can be exploited.
For instance, if you're going bald and have been
looking for treatment, you could receive the following attack:
To: John Doe
Subject: Euro Paulding Tummy
Body: asdfl;jkasdflkkjasdf;lkjasdfljkasdfl;jkasdfl
TI TV
The harassment of some targeted people is
apparently broadcasted around the country via closed circuit TV.
In the workplace this can easily be done by
surveillance systems, which many businesses now have in place. A report
based on a survey conducted on over 500 companies appeared in the May 19,
2005 issue of Business Wire in an articled entitled, Statistics Show Rise in
Surveillance of Workers. It stated, "More than half of the companies
surveyed use video monitoring to counter theft, violence and sabotage," and
that the number of businesses conducting surveillance is increasing.
McKinney has witnessed surveillance films of people being Gang Stalked in
the office. She declared that it might be used for the purpose of "creating
a sense of unity, [and] for identifying TIs who are to be harassed on the
street." In addition to facilitating group cohesiveness and identifying
targeted people, McKinney noted that it seems to be a "major source of
entertainment" for the individuals participating in this harassment.
Similarly, more overt degenerates have been known to record their actions so
they can "re-live" the experience.
"Covert workplace surveillance is big business," stated the Denver Rocky
Mountain News, on April 30, 2001. "Secret monitoring of employees has grown
dramatically," echoed Knight Ridder in their August 6, 1997 article
entitled, The Boss is Watching as Workplace Surveillance Grows. According to
these publications, the equipment is installed after hours and includes
miniature cameras hidden in thermostats, light switches, and on walls and
ceilings that are located in changing areas, locker rooms, break rooms, and
even bathrooms. Apparently there have been some lawsuits concerning this.
Non-lethal Weapons (NLW)
My goal here is not to cover this topic
in detail but to provide evidence that these weapons exist and are being
used on the civilian population.(***) They are also known as, Directed
Energy Weapons (DEW), Psychotronic Weapons, Less-lethal Weapons, and
Electromagnetic Weapons. Most targets of The Hidden Evil are hit with these
weapons. They are reportedly located in bases of operation which surround
TIs. Some may be satellite or tower-based. People also receive DEW attacks
while traveling, such as on airplanes or in vehicles. Apparently
briefcase-sized portable weapons are used.
Some of these Non-lethals are Through-The-Wall (TTW) in nature. Some states,
such as Massachusetts, have passed a law banning the illegal use of directed
energy weapons. However, the law states that federal and local law
enforcement can use these weapons. These weapons or similar ones are
currently being used on a massive scale against citizens of North America
and other NATO nations. Dr Munzert refers to "Directed energy weapons" as
the "high-tech arms of the century," and adds that they are "part of crimes
(in Europe) that almost nobody knows [about] except the victims and the
offenders."
On the topic of Directed Energy Weapons, Moret stated, "this technology was
outsourced to the FBI, and that was for the purpose of putting it in all the
police departments in the United States, where it now is." "Congress back in
the early 90s, late 80s, took the position that anyone complaining about
these systems were imagining things," declared McKinney. "By 1992," however,
"they were off the drawing board and in fact being fielded and conveyed to
law enforcement agencies." Although the surface intention for the creation
of these weapons is to save lives, the evidence suggests they are being
deliberately misused on a global scale as a traceless form of slow torture.
Some types of attacks that targets have reported can be explained with
conventional technology. For instance, some types of unclassified DEWs can
cause nausea, fatigue, headaches, liquefy bowels and a variety of other
symptoms. This is not science fiction. This technology currently exists.
Some of it is over thirty years old and has been tested on civilians for
decades. Although some of the technology being used on targeted individuals
is probably much more advanced than the weapons outlined below, I listed
them because their existence is undisputed.
In an article entitled, Wonder Weapons, the U.S. News and World Report
stated, on July 7, 1997 that, "So-called acoustic or sonic weapons... can
vibrate the insides of humans to stun them, nauseate them, or even 'liquefy
their bowels and reduce them to quivering diarrheic messes,' according to a
Pentagon briefing." Under the title, Surrender or We'll Slime You, the
February 1995 issue of Wired Digital Magazine, described that, "Enemy
soldiers might be confused by holographic projections," and "disoriented by
low-frequency acoustic beams that provoke vomiting and diarrhea." The
article stated that although these "weapons may seem like they've sprung
from the pages of Marvel Comics," that "research into these and other
non-lethal technologies has been underway for decades."
Moret contends that some of these weapons are both land and space based. And
McKinney spoke of the use of the electrical grid throughout the country, the
use of microwave towers, and devices affixed to poles that are connected to
power lines. She adds, "These weapons systems are used by neighbors
surrounding persons who have been singled out as targets of opportunity."
Despite some mainstream reports portraying this technology as "emerging," it
has been used on the civilian population for decades.
Microwave
Microwave DEWs will produce dizziness, burning, headaches, eye problems,
damaged nervous system and internal organs, heart attacks, strokes,
aneurysms, cancer, and an inability to concentrate. "Their capabilities,
generally, are to inflict pain in a highly focused fashion, and to alter
mental states," proclaimed McKinney. "In amplified forms... these
frequencies have the capacity to kill."
A common microwave oven can be turned into a DEW by modifying the appliance
to operate with the door removed. It can then be positioned against a wall
to attack someone on the other side. You can also build a weapon for a few
hundred dollars that will employ a more focused attack.
"The worst thing" says Dr. Munzert, are "the microwaves because they enter
the body... and hit the heart, and the brain, and testes." He asserts that
victims are attacked with these weapons, "night and day," and says that
those carrying out this secret policy are "merciless as you cannot imagine."
Moret stated that these weapons "cause deteriorating health, digestive
problems, tremendous pain... sleep depravation and disruption." "Sleep
disruption/deprivation," agreed McKinney, "is achieved by overt and
electronic harassment."
Similarly, the Stasi allegedly used Directed Energy Weapons on their
enemies. Dr. Munzert explained, "We have information that this Secret
Service (in German you call it Stasi) used microwave weapons to dissolute...
political opponents." Funder stated, "The Stasi File Authority began to
investigate the possible use of radiation against dissidents. What it
uncovered shocked a people used to bad news." According to Funder, although
the File Authority claimed they found no one had been killed with these
weapons, they did find that "it was used with reckless disregard for
people's health." Unfortunately, it seems that the File Authority was
probably wrong.
An article entitled, Dissidents Say Stasi Gave Them Cancer, appeared in the
BBC on May 25, 1999. It stated, "When three of former East Germany's
best-known dissidents died within a few months of each other, of similar
rare forms of leukemia, suspicions were aroused among their friends that
this was more than just a coincidence."
Speaking of the current epidemic, Dr. Munzert mentioned that a personal
friend of his was tortured to death and given cancer. In her book, The
People's State, Mary Fulbrook, declared, "The Stasi not only initiated
well-attested murders... of a number of individuals but also attempted more
subtle methods of causing long-term ill-health and death from less easily
identifiable causes, such as cancers caused by exposure to sustained high
levels of radiation."
LIDA
The Russian LIDA machine (patent 3773049) is an old brain entrainment device
used for the drugless sedation of mental patients. This device can be used
as a weapon to drain a person of energy. The pulse rate can be adjusted so
that it causes fatigue or excitability (sleeplessness). Although the LIDA
signal does not travel a great distance, it can be used TTW in an apartment
building. This device is about the size of a breadbox and works silently.
"The LIDA machine was made in the 1950's by the Soviets... [and] would put
rabbits into a stupor at a distance and make cats go into REM... The Soviets
included a picture with the device that showed an entire auditorium full of
people asleep with the LIDA on the podium."

Voice-To-Skull (V2K)
V2K, also called Microwave Hearing was
discovered during WWII when soldiers noticed buzzing sounds while standing
in front of an energized radar antenna. Dr. Joseph Sharp demonstrated a V2K
success in the mid 70s while working for the Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research. If you have a tightly focused antenna, this can be transmitted
through walls and over a distance. Voice or other sound can be transmitted
over a distance, through walls, directly into the skull of a person. This
was possible more than 30 years ago.
The March 1975 issue of The American Psychologist, which is the Journal of
the American Psychological Association, declared that 'wireless' and 'receiverless'
communications of SPEECH," had been achieved by Dr. Sharp. "Communication
has in fact been demonstrated," they proclaimed. "The capability of
communicating directly with a human being by "receiverless radio" has
obvious potentialities both within and without the clinic."
McKinney wrote, "The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) has
participated in this research since Project Pandora. In 1973, WRAIR
discovered that externally induced auditory input could be achieved by means
of pulsed microwave audiograms, or analogs of spoken words' sounds. The
effect on the receiving end is the (schizophrenic) sensation of 'hearing
voices' which are not part of the recipients' own thought processes."
V2K is used to taunt and mock targeted people. Targets of The Hidden Evil
have reported hearing doors slamming, voices, degradation of a religion,
screaming, etc. Some have experienced mock executions with gunshots.
Regarding this being a common tactic, McKinney stated, "the inducement of
auditory input [V2K]," is typical. "A lot of victims" report "Microwave
Hearing" which is a "scientific fact," announced Dr. Munzert. He describes
these V2K attacks as a type of torture.
Alex Constantine was aware of these weapons and their intended use when he
wrote in his book Virtual Government, "The intelligence agencies are capable
of transmitting voices [V2K] and images directly to the cranium's sensory
pathways. Anyone who falls into disfavor with this elite can be condemned to
interminable physical and psychological torture. The victim is often
murdered without a trace."
Silent Sound
Silent Sound (patent 5159703),
developed by Dr. Oliver Lowery of Norcross, Georgia, also called Clear
Channel, is an improvement over the time-slicing subliminal suggestions. It
does not need to compete with other sound to influence a subject because it
occupies a separate channel just beyond the human hearing range. Hence the
name, "Clear Channel." This channel is beyond human hearing but not human
perception. It is not normally in use but it is a direct conduit to the
subconscious.
Silent Sound can be used by installing a hidden speaker near person's area
of work or in their home. These suggestions can be played constantly and the
person would not be consciously aware of them. Apparently this weapon was
used on Iraqi soldiers during the first gulf war. Silent Sound can be
transmitted through ordinary radio or television carrier frequencies. Only a
speaker is necessary. But Silent Sound cannot only convey suggestions - it
can transmit cloned emotions!
An articled by Judy Wall entitled, Psy-Ops Weaponry Used In The Persian Gulf
War, which appeared in the October/November 1998 issue of Nexus Magazine,
stated, "Subliminally, a much more powerful technology was at work: a
sophisticated electronic system to 'speak' directly to the mind of the
listener... and artificially implant negative emotional states - feelings of
fear, anxiety, despair and hopelessness." Shockingly, the article continued,
"This subliminal system doesn't just tell a person to feel an emotion, it
makes them feel it; it implants that emotion in their minds" by the
transmission of "cloned emotional signatures, the result is overwhelming."
Silent Sound can also be piped through the V2K medium and transmitted over a
distance, according to retired engineer and Targeted Individual Eleanor
White. So this means that subliminal messages can be transmitted over a
distance, through walls, directly into a person's skull. In essence, into
their subconscious mind. "All schematics, however, have been classified by
the US Government and we are not allowed to reveal the exact details,"
stated Edward Tilton, the President of Silent Sounds, Inc. He announced,
"The system was used throughout Operation Desert Storm (Iraq) quite
successfully."
DEW harassment may be synchronized with other types of harassment. For
instance, if you're targeted, just as your computer crashes or the power
goes out, you get V2K. Or as you hold a letter from the IRS, you receive a
shock to your hand. This is apparently done for the purpose of mocking you.
As if to convey the message, "ha ha, it's from us." Some targets have
reported being hit with other more exotic types of weapons that cannot be
explained with current unclassified technology. These weapons have been
known to penetrate all types of shielding.
The Cincinnati Post ran an article entitled, U.S. Taps High-tech
Arsenal/Pentagon Likely to Debut New Weapons in Iraq, on March 30, 2003,
which included an interview with Clark Murdock, a former Air Force Strategic
Planner, who works for a Think Tank called the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS). Murdock declared, "Once you're engaged and you
have a capability that's almost ready, you'll try it." He continued, "All
kinds of things have been invented, particularly in the (classified) world
that will be used. If you use it and it works and no one knows, why talk
about it?"
When I consider who runs this planet, what they've done, and what their
obvious intentions are, it becomes clear to me that they intend to use these
weapons to defuse threats to their control. For instance, if someone is a
particular nuisance to the elite, they can arrange for them to experience
frequent confusion. Unless this individual knew that they were targeted,
they'd be completely unaware that this trouble was the result of an attack.
On the other end of the spectrum, if the situation calls for the immediate
neutralization of someone, they can be given cancer, a heart attack, or
stroke. This type of murder is completely silent and invisible. Dr. Munzert
refers to it as "the perfect crime."
Support Groups
My observation is that some of these support groups have been infiltrated
(or created) by perpetrators posing as victims, used for discrediting,
disinformation and disorganizing - the triple D. If you think that the
people who oversee this worldwide program have not infiltrated these groups,
or even deliberately created some as catch-nets in order to disrupt and
minimize progress, you are probably mistaken.
The people who designed this system are highly intelligent and some of these
support groups seem to be just another phase of the program. The East German
Stasi would create political groups and foster an informant's rise to
respectability. This influential informant would then impede the progress of
the group and misdirect its members at events. The logic here appears to be
that if these groups must exist, they would rather control them.
Some of these perpetrators seem to be very vocal and popular members of
these support groups. It seems that this a damage-control mechanism put in
place to corral people, manage them to some degree, and impede the groups'
progress. These people may also help with misdirecting events, or generally
keeping groups disorganized and ineffective, under the illusion that
progress is being been made.
Guided by their handlers, multiple prominent informants may work in unison
to jacket or otherwise discredit targets, who the organizers of this program
believe are a hazard to its exposure. Jacketing was often used during the
old Cointelpro, and involves the use of informants within an organization
who portray effective targets as informants. We can only conclude that in
the last twenty years they have perfected this tactic. If you are raising
awareness, then discrediting attempts will be standard practice. It appears
to be critical that they isolate you from group members who you may have a
positive influence on.
Similar to the East German informants, they may be installed and built up to
degrees of respectability by providing useful information to the group and
engaging in other activities which genuinely damage this program. Although
this may seem like a contradiction, this is the chess equivalent of
sacrificing a bishop to take a queen. They know some targets would have
eventually found the information anyway, so this trade-off is worth
appearing genuine and gaining trust, which may be exploited at a later date.
It may also create fear and uncertainty within some targets, causing them to
doubt their own judgment. Finally, this may further traumatize a target with
feelings of hopelessness when they learn that a very well respected group
member is harassing him/her. It's plain to me that these people exist to
expose a portion of the truth, but to help destroy those who seek to expose
all of it.
In my opinion, in order for a decent person to be harassing victims,
especially when he or she has an idea what they're going through, they would
have to have been blackmailed or tortured into becoming informants. If you
choose to participate in one of these support groups, you may want to limit
your exposure to certain people.
However, although these groups have their share
of perpetrators, not all of them are.
So, if you're targeted you may still want to
attend meetings and events as it will be a good opportunity to connect with
other people.
Summary
When used in combination on a recurrent basis, these tactics are a painful
and difficult to prove form of torture.
Targeted people are battered from state to state
and brought to financial ruin. Those who speak out may end up in mental
institutions. Some are framed for crimes, or setup in a manner to aid with
recruitment. Their homes are vandalized, pets tortured and killed. The
mental, emotional and physical torture that targeted people experience will
usually not stop until death.
The creators of this system have established a
virtually traceless protocol for murder.

* Sergie Kourdakov defected to Canada and
eventually ended up in Los Angeles, California. In addition to writing
his book, he spoke in churches, on television, gave newspaper
interviews, and spoke before government officials describing the
practices of the Soviet secret police. He reported to his friends that
he had received death threats. His plans to speak to the Russian youths
by way of radio broadcasts were cut short by his sudden death on January
1, 1973, which was first ruled a suicide, then an accident.

available to the public, that they're using to accomplish this online
harassment. More on this will be covered in a future book or article.
