Several developments that are coming to the fore indicate a noticeable
advance towards a government regulated, taxed and controlled system that
spells doomsday for the Internet as we know it.
The first steps in a move to charge for every e mail sent have already been
taken. Under the pretext of eliminating spam, Bill Gates and other
industry chieftains have proposed Internet users buy credit stamps which
denote how many e mails they will be able to send.
This of course is the death knell for political
newsletters and mailing lists.
The New York Times reports that,
"America Online and Yahoo, two of the
world's largest providers of e-mail accounts, are about to start using a
system that gives preferential treatment to messages from companies that
pay from 1/4 of a cent to a penny each to have them delivered. The
senders must promise to contact only people who have agreed to receive
their messages, or risk being blocked entirely."
The end game is a system similar to China,
whereby no websites even mildly critical of the government will be
authorized.
The
Pentagon admitted that they would engage in psychological warfare
and cyber attacks on 'enemy' Internet websites in an attempt to shut them
down. The fact that the NSA surveillance program spied on 5,000
Americans tells us that the enemy is the alternative media and that it will
be targeted for elimination.
Court
cases are pending after the Bush administration demanded the Google search
terms of American citizens.
The first wave will simply attempt to price people out of using the
conventional Internet and force people over to
Internet 2, a state regulated hub where
permission will need to be obtained directly from an FCC or government
bureau to set up a website.
The original Internet will then be turned into a mass surveillance database
and marketing tool.
The
Nation magazine reported last week,
"Verizon, Comcast, Bell South and other
communications giants are developing strategies that would track and
store information on our every move in cyberspace in a vast
data-collection and marketing system, the scope of which could rival the
National Security Agency. According to white papers now being circulated
in the cable, telephone and telecommunications industries, those with
the deepest pockets - corporations, special-interest groups and major
advertisers - would get preferred treatment.
Content from these providers would have
first priority on our computer and television screens, while information
seen as undesirable, such as peer-to-peer communications, could be
relegated to a slow lane or simply shut out."
We see a move to demonize the Internet and tar
its reputation. AOL is running ads equating Internet users with terrorists.
In the next few years we may see a staged Internet shutdown which is blamed
on cyber terrorists.
For the aspiring dictator, the Internet is a dangerous tool that has been
seized by the enemy. We have come a long way since 1969, when the ARPANET
was created solely for US government use. The Internet is freedom's best
friend and the bane of control freaks.
Its eradication is one of the short term goals
of those that seek to centralize power and subjugate the world under a
global surveillance panopticon prison.
