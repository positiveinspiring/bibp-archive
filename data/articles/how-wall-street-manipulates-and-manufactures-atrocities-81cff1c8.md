An attempted color revolution backed by Wall
Street unfolded in Bangkok, Thailand in 2010, leaving 91 dead.
Since then, Wall Street as well as its proxies
inside of Thailand have attempted to blame all 91 deaths on the Thai
military despite overwhelming evidence proving armed militants were involved
in the protests - this foreshadowed the techniques now being used on a
larger scale in Syria.
High profile deaths including those of foreign journalists caught in the
crossfire have become political points of leverage for Wall Street's media
machine (a technique also reused in Syria) and their Thai proxy, billionaire
Thaksin Shinawatra.
Unfortunately the same craven political stunt employed
at the expense of fallen Reuters journalist Hiro Muramoto who was killed
during the April 10, 2010 night ambush of Thai troops, is now being used
regarding the death of an Italian journalist by the Thai police currently
headed by Thaksin Shinawatra's own brother-in-law.
Police General Priewpan Damapong was appointed as head of Thailand's police
shortly after Thaksin's own sister took office last July, with much support
from Wall Street & London and demonstrating a breathtaking display of
third-world nepotism.
Damapong, it should be noted, also just recently, and
very eagerly, backed claims by both the US and Israel regarding the false
flag Bangkok bombing pinned on Iran - illustrating just how interconnected
these geopolitical ploys are regardless of geographic distance.
Claims regarding "new evidence" that Italian journalist Fabio Polenghi was
killed by a high-velocity bullet during 2010's unrest, and not an M-79
grenade as previously thought, and therefore "clearly" implicating
government troops, echoes of similar claims by Thaksin's associates in
regards to Muramoto's death and conveniently ignores the fact that both
government troops and Thaksin's militants employed not only assault rifles
firing high velocity bullets, but both fielded weapons that fired the exact
same 5.56mm rounds claimed by Thaksin and his opposition to only have been
used by government troops.
The evidence compiled in "Mainstream Propagandists: A Tale of Depravity,"
featuring photographs, video, witness testimony as well as a Human Rights
Watch report, confirms without a doubt that Thaksin's hired mercenaries not
only used the very same weapons as Thai troops, including M-16's, but had in
their possession scores of weapons confiscated from Thai troops during the
first violent confrontation on April 10, 2010.
It also provides geopolitical
analysts with perhaps the most transparent and well documented use of covert
violence to facilitate a Western-backed color revolution to date.
Video: Video footage from April 10, 2010, aired on AlJazeera, clearly shows
Thaksin's militants employing tactically both AK-47s and M16 assault rifles.
For those unfamiliar with these two weapons, and who find it difficult to
identify the weapon being carried by the Thaksin militant at (00:35), the
position of the rifle's front sight post gives it away.
The AK-47's front
sight post is located all the way at the end of the barrel and is integrated
with the compensator, while the M16A2's sight post is located right at the
end of the hand guards leaving a considerable amount of the barrel between
it and the compensator .

showing clearly the front sight posts of an M16A2.
Image: An AK-47. Notice the front sight post is located all the way at the
end of the weapon's barrel, as well as its more compact, and thicker
construction.
Image: An M16A2. Notice the front sight post's location next to the
hand-guards and the long section of barrel between it and the weapon's
compensator.

The cover of Human Rights Watch's "Descent into Chaos" report,
which, while published long after HRW itself did as much as possible to
support and defend Wall Street's proxy Thaksin Shinawatra and cover for his
armed mercenaries, finally confirms that not only did protesters have
amongst them armed militants, but that they in fact employed identical
weapons as Thai troops including M-16's firing 5.56mm rounds.
Page 62 states:
As the army attempted to move on the camp, they were confronted by
well-armed men who fired M16 and AK-47 assault rifles at them, particularly
at the Khok Wua intersection on Rajdamnoen Road.
They also fired grenades
from M79s and threw M67 hand grenades at the soldiers.
News footage and
videos taken by protesters and tourists show several soldiers lying
unconscious and bleeding on the ground, as well as armed men operating with
a high degree of coordination and military skills.
Clearly, if both sides were employing M16's - deaths and injuries resulting
from 5.56mm high velocity rounds could have been caused by either the Thai
military or Thaksin's mercenaries - exposing the latest "revelations" by
Thai police as nothing more than a shameless political stunt.
It most likely
will never be known from which rifle fired the fatal round, let alone who
was holding that rifle at the time.
Image: Not only did Thaksin's militants bring their own M16s to the
firefight, they also at one point during the night of April 10, 2010,
verifiably seized a large amount of weapons from Thai soldiers who fled in
disarray after an ambush organized by elements within Thaksin's movement.
While it is unproven whether these weapons were then used by militants
during their daily and nightly clashes with Thai troops, room is left for
considerable doubt even if Thailand's police were able to trace bullets to
rifles in government armories.
While this evidence was originally compiled and posted in regards to Reuters
journalist Hiro Muramoto's case, it can just as easily apply to all victims
of the April and May 2010 violence that unfolded in Bangkok, including that
of Fabio Polenghi to counter dubious, clearly politically motivated claims
regarding high-profile deaths during Thaksin's 2010 armed insurrection.
Atrocities Made-to-Order
- Tools of the Trade
Other examples show that while the West is perfectly content with
manipulating and spinning events as they unfold, it is also willing to
manufacture real atrocities for the sake of pinning them on a targeted
government.
This includes the premeditated murder of a pro-Thaksin protester
by Thaksin's own mercenaries - recorded on tape and extensively
photographed, then shamelessly and relentlessly used as propaganda to this
very day.
The incident took place on April 10, 2010, the same night Reuters
journalist Hiro Muramoto was killed, and gives us immense insight into how
Western-backed color revolutions will purposefully kill both protesters and
government troops to escalate tensions and violence while undermining the
legitimacy of a targeted government.
In a
YouTube video (WARNING: EXTREMELY GRAPHIC) recorded by Thaksin
propagandists, protesters can be seen facing off against troops to the left
of the screen with other protesters seeking cover as fire is exchanged
between militants and troops.
In the center of the frame, a very conspicuous
man is seen carrying a tall red flag with his attention fixated on men
directing him into position. He moves in steps, almost as if posing for a
picture with his attention focused on the men directing him.
Behind him,
with his hat turned backwards, appears to be a spotter shadowing the
flagman's moves and flashing a series of hand signals to the men on the left
directing the flagman.
Images: Frames taken from the video with annotations describe the events that
unfolded shortly before and directly after Thaksin mercenaries intentionally
killed one of their own protesters. The final image eventually made it onto
the cover of Thaksin propaganda magazine, "Voice of Taksin."
Men in the upper left of the screen can be seen waving the flagman into
position as they tell other protesters to "get down" before a shot is fired
taking off the top of the man's skull.
As protesters panic and run off
camera, the spotter moving with the flagman calmly stands above the dead man
and waves in a photographer who takes the infamous pictures that would soon
be featured on the cover of Thaksin's propaganda publication, the "Voice of
Taksin."
It must be remembered that the video camera was fixated on the
flagman the entire time to specifically capture the entire, premeditated
murder.
Image: A censored version of the very explicit "special" cover of Thaksin
propaganda magazine, "Voice of Taksin," featuring a man killed not even a
minute ago. The flag he was conspicuously waving just moments before lays
across his chest and was most likely handed to him to aid mercenary snipers
in targeting him. The original cover with translations can be found here.
(WARNING: EXTREMELY GRAPHIC.)
The editor of "Voice of Taksin" has since been
arrested and imprisoned for his role in the 2010 violence - however Western
"human rights" fronts including US-funded Prachatai maintain that he is a
"political prisoner" and a "human rights activist."
Note: on the bottom of
the magazine cover a "free" CD is offered featuring video of the gruesome
staged murder of this unfortunate young man.
This horrific, cold-blooded demonstration of the callous, murderous nature
of these so-called "pro-democracy" movements sowing chaos from Tunisia to
Thailand illustrates the full depths of depravity from which the global
elite and their proxies operate.
Behind the thin veneer of revolutionary
"singing tomorrows" is a heartless, craven killing machine as eager to
dispose of its most adamant supporters as it is inclined to eliminate its
opponents.
What was just described has played out not only repeatedly in
Thailand, but all across North Africa and the Middle East as well as during
previous attempts by the West to oust Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.
Conclusion
This not only concerns the ongoing Western-backed political destabilization
of Thailand and the implications it has for greater Asia, but serves as a
useful example, exposed in full detail, as to how Wall Street and London
runs color revolutions, how covert violence plays an integral part in
effecting both the undermining and toppling of national institutions, and
how the corporate-media preys on both ignorance and emotions to manipulate
such violence.
The lessons learned on the streets of Bangkok in 2010 allow
us to see current events unfolding in hotspots like Syria with a new, more
informed perspective and a deeper understanding of how "fourth generation"
warfare is waged.
