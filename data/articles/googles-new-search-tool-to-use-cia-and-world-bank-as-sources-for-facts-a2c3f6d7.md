Google is making a big change to how it displays results in its dominant
search engine. It is rolling out a new feature called the Knowledge Graph
which breaks from the traditional practice of matching keywords with
WebPages.
According to an article on Blog Tips about Googles Knowledge Graph,
immediate answers or facts from pre-selected sources like,
...will be provided in search results along side
the organic results:
Instead of using the typical search strength
of a particular answer, this new feature will draw facts from places
like Wikipedia for historical information,
CIA World Factbook for
geopolitical answers, the World Bank for economic facts, Freebase for
information about people and other predetermined sources.

This move by Google seems eerily similar to
Orwells Ministry of Truth in that search results or answers and facts
will no longer be gathered based on the algorithmic popularity of content,
but rather selected by Google.
Sure, most would argue that Wikipedia does a pretty good job through its
open-source format to nail down basic facts.
However, the CIA and the World
Bank are organizations with agendas sometimes counter to the truth, and
making them the authority on facts gives them tremendous power to shape
public knowledge.
Google also explains how it will collect data on you using the Knowledge
Graph:
Google-owned Freebase will also be used in the Google Knowledge Graph.
Freebase is a massive database, which according to Singularity Hub already,
has data on over 24 million people, places, and things.
Google then combines its Freebase with Metaweb algorithms to connect
everything and everyone. For the purposes of improving searches, this may be
wonderful, but its the exact type of software that can easily build and
organize a profile on all Internet users.
Watch how theyre already connecting your data points below:
So besides relying on the CIA and the World Bank to force feed internet
users facts, they will also construct and display how each person appears
in these new searches.
