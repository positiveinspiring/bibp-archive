Documentary by Andreas Pichler about NATO's secret army-net work, the
Operation Gladio and about the "shadow"-wing, operations that ran parallel
to the "official" Gladio, that infiltrated, radicalized and armed far-left
and right-wing groups in Europe.
These intelligence-"black ops" are still
operational and weren't dismantled like the official Operation Gladio-net
work.
In 1990, alarming evidence of NATO-sponsored terrorist attacks came to
light. This is the shocking story of Operation Gladio; a tale of espionage,
conspiracy and political violence.
