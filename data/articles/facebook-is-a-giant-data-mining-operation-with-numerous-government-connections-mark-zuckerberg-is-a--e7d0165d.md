# Facebook is A Giant Data Mining Operation with Numerous Government 
Connections - Mark Zuckerberg is A Hypocrite on Internet Privacy

Mark Zuckerberg the CEO
of Facebook has proven once again that
he is a hypocrite when it comes to the issues of government spying and
privacy.
Zuckerberg in a recent Facebook post made a
big fuss about all the news reports exposing government spy programs. In
fact Zuckerberg
wants us to believe he is so mad about
this that he even placed a personal telephone call to Barack Obama to
express his displeasure.
In reality, this is nothing more than a
public relations stunt by Zuckerberg as he couldn't give a damn about
your privacy. This is damage control for Facebook because they've been
caught red handed helping the government collect data.
This exposure is
bad for business because Facebook's entire business model is centered on
people trusting them with their information.
Back in 2013, one of the documents released
from the Edward Snowden leak revealed a National Security Agency
(NSA) data collection program called
PRISM.
This program allows the NSA to secretly
collect data from some of the biggest technology providers in the world.
The only oversight of the program is the secret FISA court which is
nothing more than a rubber stamp for all illegal and unconstitutional
government spying.
The document further revealed that Facebook began
participating with the NSA in that program beginning in 2009.
When this news originally broke,
Zuckerberg
flatly denied knowing anything about
PRISM claiming that the NSA did not have direct access to their servers. Notice how he did
not rule out indirect access.
Even though there are certainly questions
surrounding Snowden, it appears as if Zuckerberg has been lying about
Facebook's cooperation with the government.
The NSA's senior lawyer Rajesh De
stated on Wednesday that technology companies were fully aware of
the agency's widespread collection of data.
He also mentioned how
data was collected over the Internet and not directly from company
servers. This appears to be why Zuckerberg initially said that the
government did not have direct access to their servers.
Zuckerberg was
lying by omission since the data collection was happening indirectly.
Truth be told, Zuckerberg could really care
less about people's privacy. He has publically stated that
privacy is no longer a social norm. Facebook has also been
criticized for their
questionable privacy policies on
numerous occasions.
If all that
wasn't bad enough, Zuckerberg during the early days of Facebook
apparently told a college friend that
people were "dumb fucks" for trusting
him with their personal information.
All of the noise that Zuckerberg and others
have created has prompted the Obama regime to
hold a second meeting with technology
executives to discuss Internet privacy. Zuckerberg is supposed to be amongst the
people attending.
Despite the overtones, this is not a meeting in which
Internet privacy will be the main topic of conversation. Instead it will
be a meeting of angry technology executives expressing their displeasure
that their companies have been exposed as government data collection
fronts.
Looking at Facebook specifically most people
believe that Peter Thiel's initial $500,000 investment was what got it
off the ground. In a sense that is correct, but Facebook really took off
when James Breyer from venture capital firm Accel Partners
invested $12.7
million in the company.
Breyer is confirmed to have had associations
with Gilman Louie the CEO of
In-Q-Tel the venture capital firm
established by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1999.
In-Q-Tel is probably most well-known for
helping finance companies specializing in data mining.
They also
maintained an investment in Google before they became a household name.
This is an indirect but important connection that Facebook has to both
In-Q-Tel and the CIA especially considering what we see unfolding today.
It leaves little doubt that Facebook at the very least is a giant data
mining operation that cannot be trusted.
On top of this Facebook is filled with Jews
in key executive positions. Considering that there is an overabundance
of Jews causing havoc around the world, this in of itself is another
reason not to trust Facebook.
Besides Zuckerberg let's look at some of the
other Jews who are or who have been involved at the highest levels at Facebook.
-
The current Chief Operating Officer
is Sheryl Sandberg a Jew who spends her spare time dabbling in
ridiculous feminist garbage like trying to ban the word "bossy."
-
The current Chief Financial Officer
is another Jew named David Ebersman.
-
Eduardo Saverin who is recognized as
one of the original founders of Facebook is from a wealthy
Jewish Brazilian family.
-
Dustin Moskovitz another co-founder
who later left Facebook to help start the tech company Asana is
also Jewish.
There's probably other Jewish links to Facebook we could get into, but those are some of the major ones.
The bottom line is that Facebook is an evil
Jewish run corporation specifically designed to collect information from
as many people as possible for the purpose of data mining operations.
The extent of their cooperation with the NSA
and other government entities could be debated but there's already
enough questionable activity surrounding Zuckerberg to warrant avoiding
Facebook entirely.
It is obvious that Zuckerberg is very concerned that
Facebook's connections to government spy programs have been exposed.
Perhaps this is why he keeps repeating over
and over again that
the government "blew it" whenever the subject comes up.
Zuckerberg should just come out and tell the
truth instead of acting like such a hypocrite. Even though this would be
the easiest thing to do, he'll never do it. This is why he's pretending
as if he's on a crusade to strengthen Internet privacy.
This is all public relations to help protect
the Facebook brand and nothing else.
