As,
...and other forces seek to finalize the decades-old effort to
nationalize -
and even globalize - education by bribing and bludgeoning state
governments to impose
Common Core, one of the key agendas behind the deeply controversial
standards has been largely overlooked.
In essence, official UN documents and statements
by top administration officials reveal a plan to transform American
children, and students around the globe, into what globalists refer to as
"global citizens" ready for the coming "green" and "sustainable" world
order.
In recent years especially, UN reports and top
world leaders have been
openly boasting of
their globalist plot to create a top-down, planned,
and regimented society that is completely at odds with the U.S.
Constitution, national sovereignty, individual liberty, God-given rights,
Judeo-Christian values, and Western traditions.
A major component of the scheme surrounds
so-called "sustainability" and a
radical UN program known as
Agenda 21 encompassing virtually every facet
of life.
To prepare humanity for their vision, however,
requires
a new form of "education," globalists admit. UNESCO calls it "Education
for Sustainable Development."
On its website, UNESCO, the self-styled global
education agency, actually boasts of its plans.
"The UN Decade of Education for Sustainable
Development (2005-2014) seeks to mobilize the educational resources of
the world to help create a more sustainable future," the
UN outfit explains.
"Many paths to sustainability... exist and
are mentioned in the 40 chapters of Agenda 21, the official document of
the 1992 Earth Summit. Education is one of these paths. Education alone
cannot achieve a more sustainable future; however, without education and
learning for sustainable development, we will not be able to reach that
goal."
Before the term "sustainability" was in vogue,
the late UN Deputy Secretary General Robert Muller, the architect of
UNESCO's "World Core Curriculum," also offered some insight into the
purpose of UN-led, globalized pseudo-education.
The goals:
"Assisting the child in becoming an
integrated individual who can deal with personal experience while seeing
himself as a part of the greater whole.'
In other words, promote growth of the group
idea, so that group good, group understanding, group interrelations and
group goodwill replace all limited, self-centered objectives, leading to
group consciousness."
Put another way, smash individualism and notions
of individual rights, replacing them
with collectivism.
Meanwhile, actually educating children in the
traditional sense - teaching them reading, writing, critical thinking, math,
real history, actual science, and more - is on its way out, as globalists
openly admit in official documents and all across UN websites.
In its place,
...and other powerful globalist forces are working
quietly but fiendishly to
impose global education standards on humanity.
Among other schemes is a UN plot known as the
"World Core Curriculum" that has been in the works for decades.
So what will children learn in the "green" world
order? In a
2010 speech at a "Sustainability Summit," Obama Education Secretary
Arne Duncan offered more than a few hints.
Openly proclaiming the administration's loyalty
to the globalist UN "sustainability" agenda, Duncan boasts of how the U.S.
government is foisting it all on American children via the Common Core
national standards and a wide range of related federal and international
programs.
In fact, he said, the U.S. Department of
Education,
"is taking a leadership role in the work of
educating the next generation of green citizens and preparing them to
contribute to the workforce through green jobs."
Obama's former "Green Jobs" Czar, Van Jones,
of course, was eventually forced to resign after his own words exposed him
as a self-described "communist."
The notion of a centrally planned, UN-directed
"green" economy and "green" world order, however, never went anywhere. As
Duncan makes clear, central planners will determine what jobs citizens will
have, and central planners will train them accordingly.
Of course, the unconstitutional federal
education bureaucracy is not alone in the plot to transform America's youth,
Duncan continued, pointing to numerous other U.S. agencies and departments
that,
"have made important contributions linking
education and sustainability."
In the United States, like the imposition of
Common Core on state governments, Duncan explained that much of the federal
effort to indoctrinate young Americans into the "sustainable
development" agenda is being funded by the so-called "stimulus" plan.
At the global level,
...and more are all involved in harmonizing and globalizing
education as well.
As
Duncan made clear in a separate
2010 speech to UNESCO, the Obama
administration is fully on board with the planetary schemes as well.
"Our goal for the coming year will be to
work closely with global partners, including UNESCO, to promote
qualitative improvements and system-strengthening," he said,
quoting former South African President
Nelson Mandela to add that education "is the most powerful weapon which
you can use to change the world."
With the Obama administration as well as the
nationalization and
globalization of education via
Common Core, domestic
efforts will only intensify as well.
"Historically, the Department of
Education hasn't been doing enough in the sustainability movement," Duncan
explained in his speech, omitting the fact that the federal government has
been lawlessly pushing similar schemes to transform and undermine values on
U.S. schools for decades now - under Republican and Democrat presidential
administrations.
"Today, I promise you that we will be a committed partner
in the national effort to build a more environmentally literate and
responsible society."
The new "green" world order will be imposed
using federal power over schools, Duncan re-iterated in the speech.
"We must
advance the sustainability movement through education," he explained,
perhaps unaware that the vast majority of parents send their children to
school to be educated, not to advance the sustainability movement.
"We at
the Education Department are energized about joining these leaders in their
commitment to preparing today's students to participate in the green
economy, and to be well-educated about the science of sustainability."
The language may sound innocent enough to those
who know little or nothing about what globalists mean when they refer to
"sustainability" and the "green economy."
After all, taxpayers unwittingly
spent many millions of dollars on "focus groups" and "market research" to
help the schemers conceal the true agenda by identifying language and terms
that the public would be most likely to embrace.
But what exactly is it that
Duncan, UNESCO, Common Core, and the Obama administration admit they are
training your children to participate in?
In essence, according to UN documents and
reports, the idea is to
re-structure human civilization into a centrally planned global
society under the control of international institutions such as the UN - all
under the guise of "sustainable development."
In fact, they say so
themselves in countless reports and documents; even though, ironically
enough, central planning has always and everywhere produced environmental
devastation in addition to human misery.
Official UN documents show, for example,
that under the "green economy" banner, literally everything about human
existence must dramatically change:
-
lifestyles
-
opinions
-
education
-
health
-
consumption
-
production
-
agriculture
-
diet
-
law
-
taxation
-
industry
-
governance,
...and much more.
"Transitioning to a green economy requires a
fundamental shift in the way we think and act,"
explains a 2012 UN report entitled 'Working towards a Balanced and
Inclusive Green Economy.'
A more recent UN report, developed with help from
Obama policy architect John Podesta, noted that the "worldview and
behavior" of every person on Earth
must be
"dramatically altered."
On the other hand,
-
national sovereignty
-
individual liberty
-
free markets
-
unalienable rights
-
traditional values
-
self-government
-
religion,
...and more must all be pushed aside.
"But our commitment has to be about even more than career pathways,"
explained U.S. Education boss Duncan, sounding like a Soviet commissar
claiming that schools must "prepare workers" for jobs in the new green world
order.
"It also has to prepare all students with the knowledge they need to
be green citizens."
To that end, Duncan continued in his speech at
the "Sustainability Summit," the Obama administration is working to,
"build
the science of sustainability into the curriculum, starting in kindergarten
and extending until the students graduate from high school."
While the
Common Core standards and related establishment schemes are solidifying that
in the United States, the same phenomenon is taking place at break-neck
speed around the world.
At the
2012 UN "Conference on Sustainable Development" in Rio, for instance -
chaired by an anti-American Chinese Communist - virtually every national
government on Earth committed to do what Duncan described in the countries
they rule.
"We therefore resolve to improve the capacity of our education
systems to prepare people to pursue sustainable development, including
through enhanced teacher training, the development of curricula around
sustainability, the development of training programs that prepare students
for careers in fields related to sustainability," reads the text of the
final agreement, dubbed "The
Future We Want."
The "we," of course, refers to the
legions of bureaucrats, dictators, presidents, and mass-murderers at the
UN sustainability summit - not the public.
Traditional and classical notions of education,
however, have no place in the sustainable "green" world order.
In a stunning
admission posted directly on UNESCO's website in a document about the
agency's "Education for Sustainable Development"
machinations, the outfit makes that abundantly clear.
"Generally, more
highly educated people, who have higher incomes, consume more resources than
poorly educated people, who tend to have lower incomes," the UN
"toolkit" for
global "sustainable" education explains.
"In this case,
more education increases the threat to sustainability."
Read that sentence again, and again:
More
education threatens their vision of "sustainability" (as
do freedom, prosperity, humans, and more).
Lest there be any doubt about
the purpose of Common Core, the broader globalist vision for education, and
the fact that it has been burrowing its way into U.S. schools for decades,
consider a 1989 speech given to the federally funded National Governor's
Association - the unaccountable D.C.-based trade group that helped develop
and impose Common Core on America - by a prominent player in the "reform"
movement under contract with the U.S. Department of Education.
"What is happening in America today and what is
happening to Kansas in the Great Plains is not simply a chance situation in
the usual winds of change. What it amounts to is a total transformation of
our society," Dr. Shirley McCune, a senior official with a little-known
education outfit involved in writing national standards,
told the governors.
"So we have to anticipate what the future is and
then move back and figure out what it is we need to do today. That's called
anticipatory socialization or the social change function of schools."
Governors applauded...
Dr. Shirley McCune, who also worked with the National
Education Association, the U.S. Department of Education, and more, was not
shy about sharing the long-term agenda with the nation's governors.
"You
have to understand the breadth of the task that's before us," she continued.
"You cannot think about restructuring of education without understanding
that our total society is in a crisis of restructuring and you can't get
away from it... what we are facing is a total restructuring of the
society."
Some two decades after that speech, following a
long series of federal and international programs to pave the way,
Common Core was
officially born.
It was developed by establishment
forces infamous for openly advocating the nationalization of schooling, with
funding from prominent globalists, and using federal bribes to foist it on
states.
So far, some 45 state governments have imposed the poor-quality
national standards in exchange for "stimulus"-funded bribes and threats.
With the ongoing globalization of education
under UN and Obama administration guidance, Americans are at a crossroads.
One alternative is putting a stop to it all now,
withdrawing from Common Core, rejecting unconstitutional federal bribes and
mandates, and restoring proper education to promote a well-educated
citizenry capable of critical thinking and maintaining liberty.
The other
option, as globalist voices have made clear, is
a "green" economy - and everything that radical vision entails.
Choose wisely.
