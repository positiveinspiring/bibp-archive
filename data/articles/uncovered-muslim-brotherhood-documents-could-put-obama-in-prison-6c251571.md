In early 2012, Muslim Brotherhood
presidential candidate Mohammed Morsi pranced around Egypt
proclaiming "Jihad is our path," and thought there was nothing better than
to die in the cause of Allah - that is, the
exact language used by terrorists!
Despite this, Barack Obama gushed on
national television after Morsi was elected President of Egypt.
And oddly - or not so oddly - Obama continued to
gush over Morsi while reports surfaced that the Muslim Brotherhood were
setting up
torture chambers for their political
enemies, not to mention
openly crucifying Christians!
When Morsi was deposed, the Egyptian military
discovered a treasure trove of documents linking the Obama regime with
the illegal activities of the Muslim Brotherhood.
One such document is a list of Muslim
Brotherhood officials receiving secret bribes in U.S. currency, paid out by
the U.S. consulate, amounting to millions of dollars.
Investigative journalist
Jerome Corsi has obtained a copy of the
document held by the Egyptian military, proving the Obama regime sent
millions of dollars in bribes to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Enter
Malik Obama, Obamas half brother.
According to Egyptian television, citing the
Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt:
The Presidents brother
is one of the
architects of the major investments of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Were not just talking about the bribes the
Muslim Brotherhood received in Egypt, but the entire Muslim Brotherhood
finances - worldwide - that more than likely included an astounding
$8 billion dollar bribe to the
Muslim Brotherhood made by
the Obama regime.
The bribe was payment to guarantee that the huge
tract of Egyptian land, the Sinai Peninsula, be turned over to the Muslim
Brotherhood sister group Hamas, undoubtedly to put Israel in an indefensible
position. The Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas mince no words about their goals
for Israel: total annihilation.
According to
Egypt Daily News, a document exists showing the eight billion dollar
"holocaust" agreement with the Obama administration that was signed by
former Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Morsi and his second in command
Khairat Al-Shater, both under arrest by the Egyptian military for murder and
treason.
Does this document really exist, showing the $8
billion dollar bribe signed by Obama or one of his representatives?
Undoubtedly.
According to Khairat Al-Shaters son, Saad Al-Shater,
prior to being arrested by the Egyptian military, his father was in
possession of information linking Obama with the Muslim Brotherhood that
he says would put Obama in prison.
As reported by a multitude of
Arabic news sources:
In an interview with the Anatolia News
Agency, Saad Al-Shater, the son of a Muslim Brotherhood leader, the
detained Khairat Al-Shater said that his father had in his hand evidence
that will land the head of United States of America, President Obama, in
prison.
If the Egyptian military releases this document,
it would no doubt spell the end of the Obama presidency, bringing
impeachment, a long prison term, and perhaps even the death penalty.
Evidence U.S. Bribed...
Muslim Brotherhood Officials

Document surfaces ahead of
criminal trial of ousted leaders
Official Morsi government document:
"Direction of Grants and Gifts for
2013,"
submitted by Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabor Al Thani,
former Qatari prime
minister and foreign affairs minister
A question apparently being raised in next weeks trial in Cairo of Egyptian
Muslim Brotherhood leaders facing criminal charges is this:
Was the Obama administration paying bribes
as large as $850,000 a year to the Morsi government that were
distributed by top ministerial level officials to Muslim Brotherhood
leaders, with the direct involvement of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo?
WND is in possession of an official document
from inside the Morsi government that lends credibility to a report
published in Arabic by an Egyptian newspaper in Cairo that lists the charges
brought by the current military-controlled government against Egyptian
Muslim Brotherhood leaders.
As seen above, WND has obtained official records from the deposed Morsi
government in Egypt, with signatures, documenting monthly "gifts" paid to
Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt by the former prime minister and foreign
minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al Thani.
The document was seized from Egyptian government offices in Cairo when the
Morsi government was deposed by the military July 3.
As translated by former PLO member and native Arabic-speaker Walid
Shoebat, the monthly "gifts" listed in the document amount to bribes
paid by the Morsi government to leading Muslim Brotherhood members in Egypt,
including an annual payment of $750,000 to $850,000 in U.S. dollars.
Shoebat explained to WND the names listed on the Egyptian government
document correspond to information the Egyptian newspaper Almesryoon has
just published in Egypt reporting that the Cairo district attorneys office
has begun investigating alleged bribes the U.S. has paid through its embassy
in Cairo to
the Muslim Brotherhood.
According to the newspaper:
"A judicial source stated that the Attorney
General Hisham Barakat received during the past few days a number of
filed complaints accusing the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood and
leaders of the centrist party of receiving bribes thinly disguised as
gifts paid through the U.S. Embassy in Cairo."
The sources of the complaint stated that among
those receiving bribes paid in U.S. dollars from the U.S. include:
-
Mohamed Badie, general guide of the
Muslim Brotherhood
-
Khairat Al-Shater, deputy leader of the
Muslim Brotherhood and businessman
-
Mohamed Beltagy, the deputy head of the
Freedom and Justice Party, the Muslim Brotherhoods political party
in Egypt, and the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood group, Essam el-Erian
-
Abu Ela Mady, head of the Wasat Party
-
Essam Sultan, deputy head of the Wasat
Party
"What this document suggests," Shoebot
explained to WND, "is that the report the Egyptian newspaper Almesryoon
published in Cairo may be correct in that it appears the U.S. government
was paying monthly bribes in U.S. dollars, with payments as large as
$85,000 a month, to top Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt, with the
money being passed from the United States through the U.S. Embassy in
Cairo to the Morsi government."
Shoebat stressed to WND that the signatures seen
in the document mean it could be used as evidence in the upcoming trials of
key Muslim Brotherhood leaders, slated to begin Aug. 25 in Cairo.
Shoebat also noted that the names listed in the document match the names in
the Egyptian newspaper Almesryoon, including Mohamed Beltagy.
Reading closely the Almesryoon report, Shoebat concluded the document is
likely to be among the evidence the current government of Egypt plans to
introduce in its prosecution of the Muslim Brotherhood leaders.
The charges being brought in Cairo next week include not only bribes being
taken in U.S. dollars from the U.S. Embassy, but also murders and
assassinations, prison escapes, sniping at and the indiscriminate killing of
demonstrators, and spying or being a double-agent collaborating with foreign
governments, including both the U.S. and Qatar.
"The criminal charge being reported against
the Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Cairo suggest these are major trials
about to start," Shoebat explained to WND.
And with government documents entered into evidence, like the one WND
is publishing, the criminal charges will likely be construed as capital
offenses, with death by hanging the likely sentence."
Does Jailed Brotherhood Leader Have...
Goods on Obama?
by Walid Shoebat
August 13, 2013
from
Shoebat Website
The Obama administrations call for the release
of Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt is inexplicable.
The trip to Egypt by Senators John McCain
(R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), during which they called for the
same thing is even more inexplicable, especially since both men are
demanding answers in Benghazi.
Yes, we know Obamas leanings but why the rush
to release these prisoners and not shine a spotlight on them? If the details
of an interview with the son of one of those imprisoned leaders is any
indication, we may be getting closer to answering that question.
Saad
Al-Shater:
My father has the goods
on Obama
We caution that the following be taken with a
grain of salt but considering who said it, we thought it newsworthy too.
Here is a direct translation of the key points,
followed by some analysis:
In an interview with the Anatolia News
Agency, Saad Al-Shater, the son of a Muslim Brotherhood leader, the
detained Khairat Al-Shater, said that his father had in his hand
evidence that will land the head of
United States of America, president Obama, in prison.
He stressed that
the senior U.S. delegation currently
visiting Egypt, knows full well that the fate, future, interests and
reputation of their country is in the hands of his father, and
they know that he owns the information, documents and recordings that
incriminate and would condemn their country.
Such documents, he says, were placed in the
hands of people who were entrusted inside and outside Egypt, and that
the release of his father is the only
way for them to prevent a great catastrophe. He stated that a
warning was sent threatening to show
how the U.S. administration was directly connected.
The evidence was sent through intermediaries
which caused them to change their attitude and corrected their position
and that they have taken serious steps to prove good faith.
Saad also said that
his fathers safety is more important
to the Americans than is the safety of Mohammed Mursi.
Khairat
Al-Shater:
Does he have the goods
on Obama?
That this interview happened and the younger Al-Shater
made these claims is backed up by at least six Arabic sources.
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
[5]
[6]
When Saads comments are viewed in the context
of the bizarre behavior of U.S. officials, it provides the best explanation
to date for extremely irrational and inexplicable behavior of those
officials.
First, the interview with Saad was dated August
7, 2013.
The reference made to "senior U.S. delegation
currently visiting Egypt" is presumably a reference to McCain, Graham, and
Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns.
During that trip,
McCain and Graham both called for the
release of Muslim Brotherhood leaders with McCain making news by calling
Mursis ouster a "coup". Graham suggested that Egypt was "looking into the
abyss" and then suggested releasing Brotherhood leaders was the path away
from it (huh?).
In an interview with CNN, McCain
named Al-Shater specifically when asked
about individuals that could negotiate a future Egyptian government.
McCain and Graham:
Schizophrenia or
self-preservation?
In what may be an effort to play both sides of
the fence, Graham was one of eight Congressional Republicans who
sent a letter to incoming FBI Director
James Comey, just days before Graham went to Egypt.
That letter demanded more answers over what
happened in Benghazi. Such a demand, coupled with his call for the release
of individuals who,
probable cause suggests, should be
investigated over Benghazi is beyond curious; its schizophrenic.
The two Senators were clearly throwing bones to
the Brotherhood. Such behavior makes no sense. It would, however, if Saad
Al-Shater is telling the truth; it would also eliminate schizophrenia as a
cause.
Second, how about Saads claim that his fathers
safety is more important to the Americans than is the safety of Mursi? This
is where wed like to introduce Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns.
While Graham and McCain were busy sucking up to
the Brotherhood in Egypt, Burns visited one of its leaders in prison.
Bill Burns:
Met with Khairat Al-Shater
for 90 Minutes
He didnt visit Mursi; Burns
visited Al-Shater.
Reports put that visit at
about 90 minutes,
despite attempts by both parties to play
the visit down.
As we reported in
EXHIBIT A-1 of Addendum A,
Al-Shater is implicated in weapons trafficking through the Sinai and into
Gaza as well as negotiating prisoner releases in exchange for terrorists. He
has also been jailed multiple times.
Again,
We cant answer those questions but we can say
that Saad Al-Shaters alleged charges make more sense than the behavior of
U.S. officials.
Of course, State Department ventriloquist dummy
Jen Psaki called for the release of Mursi last month:
UPDATE on
August 13, 2013 at 6:30pm EST
Weve received feedback from more than one person who doesnt like our
including the "take it with a grain of salt" line in this post.
Just to clarify
We have no doubt that Saad
Al-Shater interviewed with Anatolia News Agency and said what he said.
In fact, thats the main reason we decided to post about it.
Were simply cautious when relying on the
veracity of a witness who happens to be the son of a terrorist and who
supports his fathers ideology.
We stand by the sourcing.
UPDATE on
August 19, 2013 at 8:15pm EST
Due to being unable to independently confirm that Anatolia News Agency
actually interviewed Al-Shater, we are issuing a disclaimer.
We stand by our translation and we initially
felt somewhat confident reporting this because so many Arabic sources
reported it as well. However, with no original source available, we would
like to make clear that any of the aforementioned claims attributed to Saad
Al-Shater cannot be confirmed.
Obama's Brother Linked to...
Muslim Brotherhood

Report says Malik directs
radical Islamic movement's investments
NEW YORK
President Obamas half-brother in Kenya could
cause the White House more headaches over new evidence linking him to the
Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and establishing that controversial IRS
supervisor Lois Lerner signed his tax-exempt approval letter.
Malik Obamas oversight of
the Muslim
Brotherhoods international investments is one reason for the Obama
administrations support of the Muslim Brotherhood, according to an Egyptian
report citing the vice president of the Supreme Constitutional Court of
Egypt, Tehani al-Gebali
In a news report on Egyptian television of a
Gebali speech,
translated by researcher Walid Shoebat, a former Palestinian
Liberation Organization operative, Gebali said she would like,
"to inform the American people that their
presidents brother Obama is one of the architects of the major
investments of the Muslim Brotherhood."
"We will carry out the law, and the
Americans will not stop us," she said. "We need to open the files and
begin court sessions."
"The Obama administration cannot stop us;
they know that they supported terrorism," she continued.
"We will open the files so these nations are
exposed, to show how they collaborated with [the terrorists]. It is for
this reason that the American administration fights us."
Shoebat said Gebali explained the news is
important to Americans who are concerned about their presidents actions,
calling it,
"is a gift to the American people," implying there were more
revelations to come.
In an interview on Egyptian television, Gebali
said the cost to Egypt has been great, and she vowed her country will not
allow any conspiracy against its people or the Egyptian state.
She insisted
that pushing Egypt to bankruptcy is unacceptable, because it would plunge
her country into a dire state similar to Iraq and Libya.
Shoebat said that if the reports are correct,
Turkey appears to play a central role in the alleged conspiracy. He
emphasized that Egypt has asserted to the international community that it
will not tolerate any attempt to push the country to bankruptcy.
Shoebats blog linked to three "very credible
sources" that corroborate the report on Gebalis comments.
Shoebat reported in May that Malik Obama is the
executive secretary of the Islamic
Dawa Organization, or IDO, a group
created by the government of Sudan, which is considered by the U.S. State
Department to be a terrorist state.
In 2010, Malik Obama attended an IDO conference
in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. One of the objectives of the IDO is to
spread Wahhabist Islam across the African continent.
Sudan President Omar Al-Bashir supervised the
conference. Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on seven
counts related to crimes against humanity.
Shoebat asserted the evidence places Malik Obama
"in bed with terrorists, working in a terrorist state as an official of an
organization created by terrorists."
Maliks
tax-exempt problems
WND reported in May that funds
contributed in the U.S. to a 501(c)3 foundation run by Malik Obama have been
diverted to support Maliks multiple wives in Kenya, an expert on Islamic
extremism has charged.
Lois Lerner, the director of the IRS tax-exempt
division currently under congressional investigation, signed the letter
approving tax-exempt status for the Malik Obamas Barack H. Obama
Foundation.
Lerner, currently on paid executive leave from
her IRS supervisory position, took the Fifth Amendment before the House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee on May 22 rather than answer
questions on inappropriate criteria used by her IRS department to delay or
otherwise deny tax-exempt status for tea party and "patriot" groups.
Shoebat has detailed his allegations in a
22-page investigative report titled "New IRS Scandal: Islamic Extremism
and Sex Slaves - Report Reveals Obamas Relatives Run Charities of Deceit,"
published on
his website.
After a thorough examination of available
evidence, Shoebat explained to WND his allegations against the Obama family
tax-exempt foundations:
When Malik Obama and Sarah Obama raised
money in the United States as the respective heads of foundations
claiming to be charities, not only did the Internal Revenue Service
illegally grant one of them tax-deductible status retroactively, but
these foundations have supported - to varying degrees - illegal
operations that acquire funding for personal gain, philandering,
polygamy and the promotion of Wahhabism, the brand of Islam practiced by
Al-Qaeda.
For the past two years, since long before the
current IRS scandals became public, WND has been reporting irregularities in
two IRS-approved 501(c)3 organizations operated in the U.S. by Obamas
half-brother and step-grandmother in Kenya.
WND reported in September 2011 the
Barack H. Obama Foundation apparently received IRS approval one month after
an application was submitted in May 2011.
The IRS determination letter June
11, 2011, granted a highly irregular retroactive tax-exempt approval only
after the group came under fire for operating as a 501(c)3 foundation since
2008 without ever having applied to the IRS.
In October 2012,
WND
reported a separate foundation, the Mama Sarah Obama Foundation, created
on behalf of Obamas step-grandmother in Kenya, has transferred funds, 90
percent of which are raised from U.S. individuals and corporations, to send
Kenyan students to the top three most radical Wahhabist madrassas in Saudi
Arabia.
Since its founding in 2008, the Barack H. Obama
Foundation, operating out of a commercial mail drop in Arlington, Va., has
solicited tax-deductible contributions on the Internet, listing addresses
and telephone numbers both in the U.S. and Kenya, without disclosing the
group lacked an IRS determination letter.
In September 2011, the IRS confirmed to WND that
the Barack H. Obama Foundation had received a determination letter in June
2011, awarding the group tax-exempt 501(c)3 status retro-actively to 2008
Malik
Obama,
best man at the wedding
of Barack H. Obama, Oct. 3, 1992
Tax-exempt polygamy?
On March 3, 2013, Andrew Malone,
reporting for the London Daily Mail,
documented that Maliks youngest wife in Kenya, Sheila Anyano, 35 years his
junior, had spent the past two years living with three of Maliks other
wives at the "Barack H Obama Foundation rest and relaxation center," a
restaurant complex that profits from visitors drawn by the familys
connection to the American president.
According to the Daily Mail, members of his
extended family in Kenya have accused Malik, a practitioner of Islam and a
polygamist, of being a wife-beater and philanderer.
Malik is accused of
seducing Sheila, the newest of his estimated 12 wives when she was a
17-year-old schoolgirl - a crime in Kenya, where the legal age of consent is
18.
Malone tracked down Sheilas mother, Mary, who
explained to the reporter that Malik Obama had "secret trysts" with the girl
after spotting her attending prayers at the mosque he has built in Kogelo,
the familys ancestral home.
Sheila, now age 20, told Ambrose that marrying
Malik, now age 55, was the "worst decision" of her life and confirmed that
she and Malik kept their marriage "a secret," because she was 17.
"At first he was good, after he started
speaking to me at the mosque," Sheila told the Daily Mail. "But he has
changed. Marrying him has been the biggest mistake of my life. He beats
me, but mostly hes just nasty and quarrelsome."
Shoebot charged
that Malik Obama is abusing non-profit funds.
"There is no evidence to suggest that Malik
is building any houses in Kogelo for widows and orphans as claimed,"
Shoebat said.
Neither is there evidence that the Mama Sarah
Foundation has built any homes for widows, orphans and HIV/AIDS victims.
"The only evidence where monies were spent
involves the Barack H. Obama Recreation and Rest Center in Kenya, which
housed Maliks 12 wives in a facility that includes a restaurant and a
mosque with a madrassa," he said.
"While building mosques is legally
considered charity, evidence shows the entire funding came directly from
entities and individuals from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain," Shoebat
said.
"There is nothing of charitable nature to
show for all the funds Malik raises from the United States. To date,
there is no evidence for any accomplishments toward building homes for
orphans, widows and AIDS victims in Kogelo or anywhere else in Kenya."
Limited financial
reporting
An IRS Form 990-EZ required for tax-exempt
organizations was filed on May 23, 2011, only days before the IRS
determination letter was sent.
Barack H. Obama Foundation,
Form 990-EZ, filed May 23,
2011, page 1
The Form 990-EZ appears to have been
hand-written by Malik Obama himself, complete with an unorthodox page of
calculations evidently included to back up the amounts entered into the
form.
The Form 990 reported the foundation had
received $24,250 total gross income for 2010, derived from contributions,
gifts and grants.
"We were not very successful this year
because of limited contributions," Malik reported on the Form 990. "The
Foundation sponsored a Youth Tournement (sic) and embarked on
construction of community bridges."
Malik surfaced during the 2008 presidential
campaign, dressed in African garb and holding a photograph of Barack Obama
in African garb.
