Once the research group
determines which parts of the brain are associated
with cognitive reasoning and narrative
comprehension, they will be attempt to impair those
sections in order to,
-
Once it is determined
that disruption of certain portions of the brain can
enhance persuasive messaging, individuals can be
persuaded to do things they normally would not do
and believe things they normally would not believe.
This could include
something as simple as telling a closely guarded
secret, to believing in government propaganda, or
even committing a violent act.
The group writes on page
26,
-
once we have
produced a narrative comprehension model [i.e.,
how individuals comprehend stories and
persuasive messages], end users [aka the
government] will understand how to activate
known neural networks (e.g., working memory or
attention) and positive behavioral outcome
(e.g., nonviolent actions) nodes with strategic
communication messages as a means to reduce
incidences of political violence in contested
populations.
The group will
investigate,
-
The group is so
confident that they will be able to induce or
disrupt the operations of narratives in the brain,
that they say on page 26 that the research,
-
offers the
capability to induce or disrupt the operation of
narratives in the brain, and develops the
capability to induce narrative validity [i.e.,
the believability of a particular
narrative/message], transportation [i.e., the
ability to be engaged by a narrative], and
integration [i.e., associating a particular
narrative with a larger, more culturally
specific narrative] with certainty.
-
The group gives the
following example of this projects usefulness:
-
If it is the case
that activation in one particular neural network
enables people to connect personal narrative to
master narratives [i.e., cultural narratives],
by disrupting activity in that brain area, we
should be able to selectively impair that
specific aspect of narrative processing while
holding other meaning making processes constant,
effectively creating a narrative disruptor.
Not only would this
be an important finding in the science of neural
networks and narrative persuasion, but would
also have considerably practical and strategic
importance.
(page 40)
Essentially, the
research aims to literally disrupt how people think
and comprehend ideas and messages.
-
Further, and perhaps
even more terrifying, on page 40, the group writes,
-
Mechanical
disruptions of narrative processing may be,
ultimately, replicated in through targeted
strategic communication campaigns that
approximate the narrative disruptions induced
via magnetic stimulation.
So, after figuring out
which parts of the brain are activated by particular
persuasive messages and propaganda, the government
can test out messages that only activate particular
portions of the brain and not others, in order to
persuade individuals to believe or not believe
something.
Essentially, they are
attempting to modify brain functioning without TMS,
and only words. One can only imagine the strategies
the government could use with this technology. They
could make the public believe almost anything that
suits their needs.
It could literally lead
to mass brainwashing.
But what does this mean,
practically?
It means that if this research
succeeds, the government will be able to modify how one
personally thinks. They could strap you in a chair, put a
machine to your head, turn off parts of your brain,
introduce a persuasive message, and make you believe it.
Further, through extensive research, they may be able to
replicate the machines brain disrupting functioning simply
through carefully crafted and researched persuasive messages
and propaganda.
They can use brain imaging to
determine which portions of the brain are activated when a
particular message is presented to an individual, and if the
right portions are activated, they know the message will
circumvent ones mental reasoning and lead to almost
automatic acceptance. With enough data, the government could
spread propaganda through the media that people will almost
automatically believe, whether it is true or not.
In terms of interrogation possibilities, Transcranical Magnetic
Stimulation can be forced upon individuals to make them
believe certain things, say certain things, and perhaps
admit to acts they did not actually commit (as the TMS can
induce narrative validity), or commit acts they normally
would not commit.
The government is literally trying to brainwash the public.
This is not science fiction.
Technology has made it possible to induce and disrupt
cognitive functioning in individuals. In the future, your
thoughts may not be your own, but ones that have been
implanted into your brain through exceedingly successful and
validated propaganda.
Meeting notes indicate concern about how the project will be
perceived, particularly the focus on the Christian/Muslim
element.

Additional
information
In 2002 The
Economist noted that neuroscience would be the
future of mind control. Well, now we're evidently here.
This area of study has received
$100 million in funding via Obama's ten-year BRAIN
Project, as well as a $1.3
billion commitment from Europe. The human brain is seen
as the final frontier, and is being explored from every
angle conceivable.
The above investments are
openly discussed.
The same is true for the National
Nanotechnology Initiative 2011 Strategic Plan. This
60-page document lays out a projected future "to
understand and control matter" for the management of
every facet of human life in the areas of environment,
health and safety. Twenty-five U.S. Federal agencies are
participating.
Concurrently, there is heavy
military funding through agencies such as the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). This
raises the question of transparency when
a "black budget"
often justifies total secrecy in the name of national
security.
Advancements in neuroscience
are coming at an exponential rate, as each day seems to
headline a new breakthrough.
For example, it recently has
been announced that:
These are mainstream
announcements and can no longer be dismissed as
conspiracy theory.
For now, there appears to be a lot of parsing of words
within the ASU project to stress that this is about
"persuasion" not "influence" which can be seen in the
meeting notes. It's also repeatedly mentioned that there
is not a desire to organically change the brain itself,
but to focus on the story being told and how to properly
disseminate information - propaganda, in other words.
Finally, there is the
troubling note about focusing on the Christian/Muslim
narrative as exemplary of the extremism which needs to
be reprogrammed.
Given what we know about the other military research
into direct mind control, any benign assertions of this
project at ASU must be called into question. The fact
that members of this group were divided into teams red
and blue to construct arguments for and against if word
were to get out to "activists" and the public is
additionally troubling.
If we combine all of this information with other
releases about The Pentagon's work with "narrative
networks," reported
on by the BBC, it becomes clear that now is
the time to discuss ethics, as no one in the scientific
and military communities seems eager to bring possible
attacks on our free will to the forefront.
This technology could affect
us all.
NOTE:
An e-mail sent to the program director at ASU requesting
comments on this research did not receive a response.
