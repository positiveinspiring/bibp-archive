After a stunning geopolitical move by Russia and
Syria involving the surrendering of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, the
special interests seeking war have been forced to adjust their rhetoric and
timetable around what is now a quickly dissolving casus belli.
The surrendering of Syria's chemical weapons would not only critically set
back rhetorical arguments being made to justify war with the nation, but
would also preempt future false flag operations in the works.
Perhaps fearing war was not possible, just such
a false flag appears to have been exposed by Russia's English language news
service, RT.
RT claims sources have discovered a plot by
terrorists to carry out a chemical weapons attack on Israel from government
controlled areas within Syria for the sole purpose of framing the Syrian
government and provoking an Israeli retaliation.
One can only imagine the torrent of propaganda that would burst forth from
the Western media invoking "gassed Jews" and the 21st Century "Hitler" Bashar al-Assad - right around the anniversary of the
September 11, 2001
attacks.

While Israel is portrayed as wanting to
"co-exist" with the current Syrian government, it should be remembered that
such public statements are meant to undermine and taint Syria's
credibility amongst the very extremist elements Israel, the United States
and Saudi Arabia have armed, funded, and covertly directed for decades.
Israel is a documented collaborator with the United States in the
subversion of,
...as indicated in the extensive body
of work represented by the Brookings Institution's 2009 "Which
Path to Persia?" report, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist
Seymour Hersh's 2007 New Yorker piece, "The
Redirection."
