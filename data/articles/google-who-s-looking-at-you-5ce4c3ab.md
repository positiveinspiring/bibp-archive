In the blissed-out California sunshine, the
glistening glass-and-steel curves of the Googleplex seem to sweep you up off
the pavement with the promise of a glimpse into the future and a good
time.
It is 8am on a Monday morning and battalions of
high-tech foot soldiers arrive at the gilded palace of the online
revolution. Laptops and lattes in hand, they step off conga lines of
biodiesel-powered buses, chatting loud and fast about the latest
skyrocketing Silicon Valley start-ups, which have names that sound like
Teletubbies: Jajah, Orgoo, Ningo.
Geek by geek, they head inside to begin surfing
and controlling the quadrillions of bytes of information that surge through
Googles giant servers, and which crash on to our desktops and mobile phones
every minute of every day.
The sidewalk outside Googles corporate headquarters in Mountain View, 40
minutes drive south of San Francisco, is about as close as most people get
to a company that has cornered the market in internet searching and become
the killer app of the modern information economy. For all its success,
Google is a closed system, as impenetrable as its complex search algorithms.
Its multibillionaire founders, Sergey Brin, 34, and Larry Page,
34, scarcely do interviews, and reporters rarely make it through the
companys doors to talk to top executives. But the dome-headed maths nerds
are facing their first big setback. Suddenly, they need to talk. So, a few
weeks ago they invited The Sunday Times into the heart of the search
industrial complex.
Google likes to think of itself as crunchy
wholesome and worthy and, walking into the Googleplex, it looks, at first
sight, a pretty crunchy kind of place. Theres free coffee and muesli in the
No Name breakfast cafe. Everyone gets around the campus on free bicycles. In
the car park, the canopies that protect the neat ranks of hybrid Toyota
Priuses from the sun are made from solar panels that power each building in
the 1.5-million-sq-ft complex.
There are swimming pools, massage chairs and
free medical checkups. A model of Sir Richard Bransons
SpaceShipTwo prototype commercial spacecraft hangs from the rafters in
the lobby. This is rocket science, after all.
Marissa Mayer is waiting in an anonymous-looking whitewashed conference room
in Building 43, the engine room of the search engine. Like all Google key
executives, she is annoyingly young 32 and, even more annoyingly, wealthy
worth hundreds of millions of pounds, thanks to the generous stock
options granted to the firms founding staff.
She does her best to deflect the wealth issue by
wearing flats, a studiously plain grey-black dress, and a $50 plastic watch
a combination that shrieks:
I know you know Im a zillionaire, but
please treat me as just one of the girls.
The young, fast-talking blonde is the firms
poster girl. Its her job to sell Googles vision of a connected future.
Weve only achieved 2% of what we can do, she smiles. The world of search will get much, much
bigger.
Her task used to be really, really easy. Google
made cool stuff the best search engine and some whizzy online services,
such as Gmail, Googles e-mail system and handed it out free. We grabbed
it and told all our friends about it, so they grabbed it too. Google became
the most popular internet service in the world. Thanks to its keyword online
advertising system that matches ads with search queries, it generated
billions Â£8 billion last year alone.
But as it prepares to celebrate its 10th birthday, Google has developed
serious engine trouble. A series of missteps have left it facing claims that
it has gone from a benign project creating the first free, open-all-hours
global library to the information societys most determined Big Brother.
It stands accused of plotting some sinister link between its computers and
us: that it wants, somehow, to plug us into its giant mainframe as
imagined in The Matrix or Terminator.
The crisis began a few months ago when Googles chief executive, Eric
Schmidt, popped up in London and made some extravagant remarks about the
firms ambitions.
He declared that the companys goal was to collect as much
personal data as it could on individual users so that it could improve the
quality of its search results and even start making recommendations, like a
trusted friend.
We are very early in the total information
we have, he said. We cannot even answer the most basic question about
you because we dont know enough about you. The goal is to enable Google
users to be able to ask questions such as What shall I do tomorrow?
and What job shall I take?
His comments provoked a firestorm.
Right-to-privacy campaigners howled that a machine that knows so much about
us that it can tell us what to do would be the biggest-ever threat to
personal privacy.
No totalitarian regime, no Bond villain had
dreamt up anything so creepy.
At what stage, one critic asked, did the
company whose motto is Dont be evil evolve into the Evil Empire?
-
Whats going on?
-
Is Google trying to take over the
worlds information and worm its way into our consciousness?
-
When he said he could implant a Google
chip in our brain, was Brin not joking, after all?
-
Or have we all got the wrong end of the
memory stick?
You only have to spend a few hours in the
Googleplex, talking to Mayer and fellow Googleytes, to realize that, if
anything, Schmidt was being conservative. Instead of worrying that they are
going too far, Googles top team talk, with poker faces, about a 300-year
mission that will eventually see almost everything including, perhaps,
one day you and me linked to the web and searchable online.
Googles techno-dream comes in three bytes.
The first is loosely referred to
as universal search. Scribbling frantically on a whiteboard, Mayer,
Googles head of search products and user experience, says the web is
currently very limited and primitive. It consists mainly of words, images
and some music, mostly created in the last few years. There is much, much
more that could and should be online.
At its simplest level, this includes every film,
TV show, video or radio broadcast ever made; every book, academic paper,
pamphlet, government document, map, chart and blog ever published in any
language anywhere; and any piece of music ever recorded. Google is currently
developing new software that will scan millions of new sources of
information to give richer search results.
Mayer illustrates the idea by googling her hero, Apples founder, Steve
Jobs, on her PC, which already uses an experimental version of universal
search.
The results include video news archives, the latest news on the iPhone, highlights of Jobss career, and up-do-date news stories.
You get six searches for the price of one,
she says in her curiously giggly voice.
So far, so uncontroversial but theres much
more.
Mayer and co argue that to be true to its
mission statement of "organizing all the worlds information and making it universally accessible
and useful", Google should be about more than searching for words, images
and music; it should be about finding objects and, eventually, people.
Any item that can be fitted with a
radio-frequency identifier an electronic tag called an
RFID can be
linked to the internet over local or national WiFi networks. Retailers
already use this technology for stocktaking, and fleet managers track buses
and taxis this way.
Why not, asks Mayer, "take the things you care about your
watch, your phone stick little tags on them and watch for their
receiving signals"?
This is not a joke.
It would have been really useful to me
yesterday when I lost my cell-phone while it was out of power. It took me
half an hour to find it had fallen behind a dresser.
And why not go one step further and tag your
partner or your children, so that you can find out where they are whenever
you want? Googleytes point out that we already do this with newborn babies
and pets.
The second part of Googles techno-dream is personalised search.
Google
has just launched iGoogle, a new turbocharged version of its regular search
service. It allows Google to monitor our search and web-surfing history, so
that it can find out:
... anything, in fact, that it can glean from our web-surfing,
which, since we do so much online these days, means pretty much everything.
Google wants us to sign up for iGoogle on our
PC, and also to install it, along with Gmail, Google Maps and
Google Earth
software, on our mobile phone, so that it knows not just who we are but
where we are in the world, 24 hours a day, thanks to the
satellite-positioning chips starting to be included in mobile phones.
Our goal is that you can, if you want,
search for anything, anywhere, any time, says Douglas Merrill, 37,
Googles chief information officer.
The final piece of the Google future is called
cloud computing.
Instead of using the internet to search for information
that we then copy and use to work on documents stored on the hard drives of
our computers, using the software on those computers, Google wants us to
create all our documents online, to work on them online using Googles
web-based software, and to store them online on Googles vast global network
of servers.
Google has recently launched its own web-based
software programs called Google Apps that enable us to create
password-protected word files and spreadsheets, edit them and store them
online.
These applications along with Gmail, Calendar,
Googles online diary, Picasa, its picture-management and storage system,
and Presentations, its online version of PowerPoint mean Google will
provide all our computing and storage needs, not on our PCs but, as Mayer
puts it, in the computational cloud.
Googles overall goal is to have a record of every e-mail we have ever
written, every contact whose details we have recorded, every file we have
created, every picture we have taken and saved, every appointment we have
made, every website we have visited, every search query we have typed into
its home page, every ad we have clicked on, and everything we have bought
online.
It wants to know and record where we have been and, thanks to our
search history of airlines, car-hire firms and MapQuest, where we are going
in the future and when.
This would not just make Google the largest, most powerful super-computer
ever; it would make it the most powerful institution in history. Small
wonder that the London-based human-rights group
Privacy International has
condemned its plans as hostile to privacy, and EU ministers called
Googles vision Orwellian.

Even John Battelle, one of the nets
leading evangelists, who co-founded the technology bible Wired magazine, and
wrote The Search, the definitive study of Googles rise, now says:
Ive found myself more and more wary of
Google, out of some primal, lizard-brain fear of giving too much control
of my data to one source.
It all begs one key question: why?
What makes a
bunch of California geeks who are relaxed enough to spend their lives
creating extraordinary products and then give them away for nothing
suddenly want to take over the world, or at least its information?
To Googleytes, the most surprising thing about the row over its plans for
the future is that anyone is surprised at all. Its founders have always
envisaged a vast super-computer that connects everything and everyone.
Ask Craig Silverstein. He knows because he was there at the beginning, when Brin
and Page were graduate students messing about with algorithms at Stanford
University, California, when they should have been out getting laid.
Silverstein is a man for whom the word geek
could have been invented. He is young 34 thin, has a beard and speaks
softly. He does not like to travel more than once a year. He was Googles
first employee and, even though he is now worth Â£250m, he still turns up to
work every day because he likes solving complex software-engineering
problems.
We meet in another anonymous meeting room with
no windows. For a firm that expects us to tell it everything about
ourselves, Google is remarkably coy about revealing the simplest information
about itself such as what its executives offices look like. Interviews in
the executive suite are banned for fear that journalists might uncover its
software secrets.
Over coffee, Silverstein, now director of technology, explains that, from
the earliest days, Brin and Page envisaged a super-connected computer.
The vision of search has always been
broader than has been portrayed in the press, he says. We would
explain it every chance we got. I dont think the press misunderstood
it. It was just that they were focused on what the users were into at
the time.
He recalls one example that shows that Brin and
Page imagined that one day even the smallest stuff would be online.
When we were doing the first
research, we used to eat in Whole Foods [an organic supermarket chain].
We talked about using search to find out what aisle the salt is on.
Instead of having to look at the big signs at the top of each aisle, you
could use a search engine to tell you where in the store everything is,
and maybe graph it out for you.
Brin and Page were obsessed with recording,
categorizing and indexing anything and everything, and then making it
available to anyone with internet access because they genuinely believed
and still do that it is a morally good thing to do. It may sound
hopelessly hippie-ish and wildly hypocritical coming from a couple of guys
worth Â£10 billion each, but Brin and Page insist they are not, and never
have been, in it for the money.
They see themselves as latter-day explorers,
mapping human knowledge so that others can find trade routes in the new
information economy.
Google has been trying to democratize
information to make it possible for everyone in the world to access the
information they need to do the things they need to do, Silverstein
says.
Belief in the value of information for its own
sake was behind the firms highly controversial decision to cave in to
demands from the Chinese government for censorship so as to break into the
giant local market. Some information, Google reckoned, is better than none.
In spite of the growing public paranoia over its omnivorous intentions,
Google is convinced that the more we find out about what it is up to, the
more we will agree with it. The man whose job it is to persuade us to live
on planet Google is Sep Kamvar, the firms head of personalization.
Hes a good choice. The 30-year-old shaggy,
flip-flop-wearing, softly spoken surfer dude could not look less Big
Brotherish if he tried.
We meet shock! in yet another whitewashed
conference room. He makes his pitch by first appealing to my wallet. Cloud
computing and data storage are free for personal users. If I sign up, I will
never again need to spend hundreds of pounds buying software and zip drives
to back up my data. Google will do it all for me.
The vision of a paperless future where all
documents reside online sounds tempting. Being tied to a physical PC box
is old-school.
Personalization, Kamvar concedes, sounds scary but is in fact
designed to help Google to help me. The more he and his fellow Google
engineers know about me, the better they can tailor search results to my
needs and interests. They can also start making recommendations I might find
useful.
Kamvar illustrates his point with a simple
example:
Say you are in Britain and youre
interested in new restaurants in your area. You search for new
restaurants. Google, now, will give you information about new
restaurants in Britain. If you want new local pizza or pasta
restaurants, you have to work through the list searching for the Italian
restaurants in your area. Its inefficient. If, however, you share your
web history with Google, it will know that you like Italian food best
because you search for it the most, and it will know the area you live.
It will move the Italian restaurants in your area up in your search
results.
Putting Google on my mobile phone and tracking
my movements is also designed to deliver the best search results.
When I search for new restaurants on my phone,
he tells me, it will automatically put new Italian restaurants at the top in
whatever location I find myself whether it is London or Silicon Valley. It
wont be long, he adds, before Google will tell me when hot new Italian
restaurants open in London without my even asking it to.
An early version of Googles Recommendations
service is currently available in the US and Europe. It will soon be
extended to cover new jobs, activities and even social networking so that
it can fulfill Schmidts dream of telling me what to do tomorrow or which
new job to apply for.
Put this way, Googles vision sounds a little less threatening but,
-
How long will my data be stored for?
-
How do I know that it will not be
misused?
-
Whats to stop Google mining my search
history and files and folders to create a detailed personal profile
that it can sell to advertisers who will bombard me with targeted
ads?
The man who claims to have the answers is Elliot
Schrage. The former member of the US
Council on Foreign Relations wears the
chinos on privacy as Googles head of global communications and public
affairs.
We meet in Charlies Cafe. Forget everything youve heard about hippies and
food. Google has the best canteen in the world. Oyster shuckers shuck
Washington States finest to order. There are freshly grilled prawns and
lobster, and the only lentils are in the Moroccan mezze. Schrage
points out that Google has legally binding privacy-protection agreements
with its users. If I sign up for iGoogle personalized search, Google
formally agrees to safeguard my privacy.
To prevent others rogue or negligent Google
employees or hackers misusing my profile, it is not directly linked to my
name. Only a handful of very senior Google engineers can access my data. Not
a single byte will ever be made available far less flogged to
advertisers.
Schrage adds that handing over my personal data is optional.
We are not forcing you to give us access.
I have to opt in to iGoogle. And even then, I
can control how my web use is monitored. I can, if I want, restrict it
simply to web searches, rather than all web history. I can delete certain
search queries or web pages that I have visited from my search history. If I
decide I dont like the idea of personalized search, I can permanently
delete my search history and go back to using Googles regular search
service, where I can be sure none of my personal search or web history will
be recorded.
Google stores all general search queries for 18
months, but the information is aggregated and not linked to individual
users.
We are only the 300lb gorilla in the corner
of the room if you want us to be your 300lb pet, Schrage jokes.
Critics dismiss the measures as ineffective.
They point out it is up to me to permanently delete my
iGoogle personalized
data. Many users will forget, and their personal data will be out there
for ever. Google, they claim, is experimenting with sending targeted ads to
mobile phones. However strict its privacy policies may be, some fear the
firm may be forced one day to
make public my private data whether it wants
to or not and regardless of whether I want it to or not.
Competition authorities on both sides of the
Atlantic have forced Microsoft to share some of its Windows software with
rivals because, regulators argued, Microsoft tried to use its
market-dominant system to stifle competition.
If Google uses our data to
create its own monopoly, regulators might take similar action.
Back in the lobby, the blissed-out California sun is dipping below the
horizon, turning the glass-and-steel curves of the Googleplex the color of
burnt sugar. The foot soldiers of the online revolution are heading home,
laptops and lattes in hand. I have spent two days inside the black box and
Googles aims are, at last, a little clearer.
Google thinks that creating a
free-to-use global library and global computer is a good thing. But it can only become a really useful library
and computer if it knows more about the people that use it: you and me.
If we trust it, it can do things for us we could
never have imagined, things that Googleytes call the magic stuff.
-
Want every computer in the world to be
our computer? Sign up for cloud computing.
-
Lost our keys? Google will find them.
-
Want to have an alfresco lunch? Use our
Google-enabled phone to view images of our nearest Italian
restaurant, check it has a terrace and book a table.
-
Want to know how far our bus is from the
bus stop or where the nearest taxi is? Look online.
-
Worried that our child has safely
reached school? Google him or her. Search and ye shall find.
The Â£100 billion question, therefore, is:
In spite of the growing furore over privacy, the
signs are that we might sign up. iGoogle personalized search is Googles
fastest-growing new product. It already accounts for one in five searches in
America.
The service has just been launched in Europe,
and Google claims the take-up is strong.
Apples wildly popular iPhone already uses location-aware Google Maps, and
online queues are forming for Googles soon-to-be-launched suite of
mobile-phone applications that will work on any handset. Some of Americas
largest firms, including Procter & Gamble and LOrÃ©al, are already using
cloud computing, in the first serious challenge to the dominance of
Microsoft Office.
Polls show that, in spite of the recent furore, many web-users here and in
the US do not care about privacy. According to a recent study by the
Ponemon
Institute, a US-based privacy think-tank, 68% of Americans believe that
online privacy is important, but only 8% care enough about it to change
their online behavior.
Above the din of chattering classes railing against
Googlezilla can be heard the tip-tap of hundreds of millions of ordinary
users willingly signing up to what they consider to be Googles benign
digital dictatorship. Whats another hunk of privacy lost if it makes life
easier?
As I walk out of the Googleplex, I notice a new feature by the exit. Its a
giant 3-D computer-generated image of the globe which has giant red lasers
shooting up into the sky. Each laser represents the number of Google search
queries made at that point on the Earths surface. The higher the spikes,
the greater the number of queries. It is supposed to be a celebration of
what Google has achieved so far.
But it also highlights how much of the world it
has already conquered and reveals how much it soon hopes to colonize. It is
the perfect metaphor for where that simple little search box we use every
day has come from and what its vaulting ambitions are. It does not simply
want to be a good search engine on the web: it wants to be the web.
Will it get there?
In the end, its up to us. Google has only gone
from being the most famous misspelling since potatoe to a verb recognized
by the Oxford English Dictionary because you, me in fact, almost all of us
use it. If we carry on logging on, it will carry on growing. And growing.
If we dont, it wont.
The choice the click is ours.
From a garage to the
globe
-
1997 Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two
24-year-old Stanford University computer- science graduate students,
register the domain name google.com. The word google is an
accidental misspelling of googol, which refers to the number 10 to
the power of 100 (or 1 followed by 100 zeros)
-
1998 Google becomes a private company
and launches on the worldwide web. Its headquarters are based in a
garage in Menlo Park, northern California
-
2000 Google begins to sell ads linked to
key search words
-
2001- 2 Advertising revenue and
deep-pocketed venture capitalists help Google to ride out the dotcom
crash
-
2003 Google expands rapidly, driving
internet use and threatening industries as varied as music,
newspapers, television, advertising, telephones, travel and
pornography
-
2004 Google floats on the Nasdaq. Its
shares initially sell for Â£40. Today they fetch more than Â£300,
valuing the company at almost Â£100 billion
-
2006 Google buys
YouTube, the largest
and most popular video-exchange website
-
2007 Google announces its Â£1.5 billion
plan to buy
DoubleClick, the leading display-advertising business
that also tracks web-users search behavior
What makes google go?
-
Two factors explain Googles
extraordinary success its search-related services and its
advertising business. Search brings in the crowds. Advertising
brings in the money
-
Google dominates the market for search
because in 1998 its founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, invented a
better way to index and rank web pages
-
Before Google, search engines simply
looked for keywords and their position on web pages to determine
their content and importance. Unscrupulous publishers manipulated
the system by filling their pages with popular keywords, usually
hidden from view, to earn high rankings in search results
-
Instead of analyzing the content of each
page, Brin and Page devised
PageRank, a complex mathematical
algorithm that tallied how many other influential sites linked to
that page
-
The partners reckoned that sites that
were well connected would be of higher quality. They were right.
Google delivered more useful search results than its rivals
-
Thanks to PageRank and dozens of other
constantly evolving filtering, classifying and indexing systems
Google is now the most popular internet-search engine. In the US,
the worlds biggest online market, Googles share of queries is
around 60%, Yahoos 23%, Microsofts 12%, Time Warners 4.5%. In the
UK and much of Europe, Asia and Latin America, Google handles three
out of every four search queries
-
Googles second big breakthrough came
with its advertising system, called
AdWords. When you search for a
topic on Google, small paid-for text ads show up next to search
results
-
While it didnt invent search-triggered
ads, Google figured out a far more efficient way of turning
web-users into buyers. Rather than doling out premium space to the
highest bidder, as its competitors did, Google used another
algorithm to work out how relevant the ad text was to a given query
and the odds someone would actually click on it. This meant ads were
targeted at the users most likely to respond to them. The result was
that Googles click through rate (the number of times users click
on ads) was twice as high as its nearest competitors. It has
captured more than half the search-engine advertising market
