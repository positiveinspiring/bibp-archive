Has the rest of the world really signed
up to GM foods - or are the politicians and biotech companies
telling GM porkies?
My heart always sinks when, listening to the
BBC's
Today program,
someone from the Department for International Development starts talking
about the "international food crisis", and the starving people in all those
poor undeveloped countries (the ones we helped to pauper with our empire
building).
I know for sure that in the next day or two, in
the top political slot on
Today, I'll be listening to
Environment Minister Owen Paterson telling us that we must embrace GM
technology if we want to feed the world.
It normally coincides with his giving a speech
or two about the wonders of GM crops and food, full of outrageous and
unscientific statements. Prime Minister David Cameron chips in with a
comment to the media about how Britain is losing the scientific race to feed
the world.
It happens with depressing regularity, and it
never goes as smoothly as they hope.
Although Monsanto has, for now,
withdrawn from Europe, the lobbying of politicians is relentless.
Last year the GM companies, having met with
ministers at a little-publicized 'Growing
for Growth' conference, started another push to promote GM. They were
immediately backed up by Owen Paterson insisting that GM food will sort our
problems - no worries.
He was followed in July by David Cameron saying
Europe was "being
left behind" even though the previous month it had been disclosed that
GM food is
banned from all the restaurants and cafes in the Palace of Westminster,
and he himself was refusing to say whether he'd feed GM food to his family.
Chivvied by the biotech people, Paterson made a
further push later last year but the campaign was spoilt in January by a
report stating that almost 50% of the world's food is
wasted.

The hunger is a result of how we manage the world, not the
earth's inability to feed us.
Perhaps the biotech companies were encouraged by
a survey
published in March last year, showing that more people were now
"unconcerned" about GM crops and food. The trouble with surveys like this is
that you can point to the bit that supports your opinion and, if you are the
Environment Secretary, Prime Minister or perhaps a biotech CEO, happily
ignore the rest.
So while both ministers and media trumpeted the
news that more people (25%) were now unconcerned about GM food (up from 17%
in 2003), they ignored the other 75%, especially the 46% that remain
concerned about the technology and its risks.
However, according to
Farmers Weekly, those who took part were also asked which crops they
would be happy to see grown - in the UK.
Having obviously listened
to Paterson's intemperate and inaccurate statements about Golden Rice, 64%
said they would "theoretically" support rice with added vitamin A.
It would seem the respondents have little
knowledge of our,
-
climate (rice grows in hot climates and
though some high-altitude strains exist, they need levels of
sunshine we can't provide);
-
agriculture (some people have succeeded
in growing rice in UK greenhouses, which hardly compares with fields
of wheat, maize and canola / rape);
-
biology (carrots, spinach, kale,
cabbage, pumpkins, winter squash etc, are all high in beta-carotene
/ vitamin A, so no need to add it to rice, just eat a balanced diet)
-
geography (the last time I looked, the
UK was not part of the Philippines which is where Golden Rice is
being
developed, and where 1.7 million Filipino children suffer from
vitamin A deficiency)
But then Guy Adams
wrote in June this year,
"a recent survey by Which? found
that 71 per cent of Britons believe GM food, and meat from animals fed
on GM food, should be banned from supermarkets. A further 15 per cent
are 'undecided'. In other words, just over one in ten thinks it's a good
idea."
And a YouGov poll this year found that only 21%
of the public supported GM food.
Further, despite the hard sell by Paterson and
Cameron, 43% of people said they "were completely against" the government
promoting GM technology.
A
survey of farmers published at the same time (funded by Barclays in
collaboration with Farmers Weekly), found that even farmers are
reluctant to grow GM crops and only 15% of them would eat GM food. They're
at one with Westminster there then, with its reluctance to eat the stuff.
Having failed with the public and with those who
grow our food, one could understand that GM companies feel the need to lobby
UK politicians in order to further their desire to control our food supply.
But in the United States, where much of the food
is now so GM based that it is difficult to avoid eating it, you would think
they had won the battle for American hearts and intestines. Yet Monsanto
still generously supports Republicans and anyone else that can push their
agenda forward, which argues that even there the battle over public opinion
is not won.
Last April US citizens were outraged by the
passing of what became
known as the 'Monsanto Protection Act', a rider (H.R.933) quietly added
to the Agriculture Appropriations bill, which says federal courts cannot
intervene and halt biotech companies from planting and selling GMO goods to
the public, even if testing proves them to be potentially hazardous to the
greater public.
Senator Barbara Mikulski issued
a statement
apologizing for letting this be signed into law.
She said that,
"she didn't put the language in the bill and doesn't support it either."
According to
Russia
Today,
"Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Missouri) has been
credited with crafting the language of H.R. 933 by working directly
alongside Monsanto. Blunt has received $64,250 from Monsanto towards his
campaign committee between 2008 and 2012."
Well, there's a surprise.
Last May, despite the fact that several states
wanted it, the Senate
refused to allow
them to enact laws forcing manufacturers to label products with GM content.
Senators of states that grow a lot of GM crops strongly opposed this move.
Among their reasons were that "labels would raise costs for consumers".
A bit of honesty and extra ink on a label is
going to cost more?
But the public fights on. In October the
Senate killed off the
Monsanto Protection Act. As in Britain, US citizens
are suspicious of GM foods.
According to the
Cornucopia Institute,
"polling conducted last year by the Mellman Group indicated that nearly
90% of Americans would like GMO foods labelled so they can make a choice
about what kinds of foods they purchase in the marketplace."
Choice? GM foods?
Where pro-GM politicians are
concerned, the two don't belong in the same room, let alone in the same
sentence.
And now we hear of the cosy government/biotech
relationship in South Africa. This month the African Centre for Biosafety,
having already shown that the entire maize meal market is saturated with GM,
released a
report showing how a select group of companies (with government backing)
now controls the entire maize chain, to the detriment of the poorest people.
In
Africa, only,
-
South Africa
-
Egypt
-
Sudan
-
Burkino Fasso,
...currently grow
commercial GM crops, and despite public opposition, the lobbying of
governments by Monsanto and others will most likely mean many more African
farmers being pressured into growing them.
You would think, if you listened to the constant
bleating of our politicians, that Britain is "being left behind" by the rest
of the world, because of our reluctance to join the GM revolution.
Primed by the lobbyists, they give the
impression,
-
that everywhere but here, people's fields and fridges are full of
GM crops and foods
-
that if anywhere suffers from food insecurity it will be
us
-
that poor people in the developing countries will suffer from food
insecurity unless we grow GM crops here (I'm still trying to understand the
logic of that one)
Has the rest of the world really signed up to GM
foods - or are the politicians and biotech companies telling GM porkies? [*]
[*]
For
international readers: 'porkies' is an example of Cockney rhyming slang.
Pork pies = lies.
The reverse of course is the truth. Politicians
who are less joined at the hip to big business are listening to the people,
the farmers and consumers. More places are opting to be GM-free.
Countries like Uruguay that have grown GM crops
are
banning the introduction of any new crops. The Mexican government
recently banned the planting of all GM maize - but then Mexican farmers
surely know more about real maize than Monsanto!
Several South American countries, having grown
GM crops for some time, are gradually changing the rules.
-
In November 2011
Peru introduced a
10-year ban on all GM crops.
-
Brazil has, for the time being at least,
introduced a ban on planting GM seeds.
-
Paraguay is planning a similar ban.
-
Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela have all
declared
national bans on GM foods.
-
In Europe, despite heavy lobbying and
pro-GM politicians trying to open up the market and our fields,
people are still making their voices heard.
In Europe,
-
Italy has a complete ban on all GM
crops.
-
France, Luxemburg, Germany, Austria,
Greece, Romania and Poland have banned Monsanto's maize.
-
Switzerland has a moratorium on all
genetically engineered crops and animals, due for renewal in
December 2017.
Switzerland did several studies on the risks and
benefits of GM crops and although they felt that there may be little danger
in growing them, also decided that, for Switzerland, there was little
financial benefit to be had either.
This year
Hungary, which had banned GM crops, found that the forbidden crops were
being grown illegally anyway. The government didn't hang about - all the
crops were destroyed.
A new Hungarian law enacted back in March
stipulates that before any new seeds are introduced into the market, they
must first undergo checks to make sure they are free of GMOs. They are now considering making the planting of
GM seeds a felony. And
Russia is considering a total ban.
However, other EU countries have not managed a
comprehensive ban, although various areas within countries have taken
action.
-
In the
United Kingdom both Scotland and Wales are officially 'GM-free', though
Owen Paterson will probably ignore such democracy. Various local authorities, including 17 County
Councils, have voted to remain GM-free, mostly in order to help protect
organic growers.
-
In
Ireland there are 9 GM-free counties. The Republic of Ireland wanted to
make the whole island GM-free, but sadly Northern Ireland wouldn't
cooperate.
In North America, some US states like California
are GM-free. Canada's civil society is constantly campaigning against GM.
New Zealand has a ban as does South Australia and Tasmania.
Japan banned the growing of GM crops but,
"Japanese food manufacturers are actively
importing 'Roundup Ready' GMO canola grown in Canada primarily to
manufacture canola oil.
As a
result, scientists have found that the GMO canola variety is now growing
wild along roadsides and ports that have been the supply line for canola
importation."
What is noticeable about these bans is that in
many places both people and their governments are not against research into
genetic modification. No. They are against the wholesale marketing of
the biotech corporations that have no regard for the earth.
But why Poland, Hungary, Paraguay and the rest?
One reason may be that in so many places,
despite the globalization of Western culture, people have managed to
maintain their links to,
-
a rural peasant culture
-
a culture that lives according to the
pace of nature
-
that lives closer to the land
-
whose farmers embody generations of
earth-based wisdom
-
whose people have an interest in growing
clean healthy food because it is what they themselves eat
This is not to say that the bans we have
achieved will not be reversed by GM-lobbied politicians.
We must keep up the pressure.
People who love their patch of earth and love
the food they eat are turning out to be remarkably GM-resistant - unlike
their genetically modified politicians who are now logic- and
science-resistant and extremely lobbyist-tolerant.
