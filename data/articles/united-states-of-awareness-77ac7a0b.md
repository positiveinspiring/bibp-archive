United States of Awareness
Governing without leaders
This Awareness indicates this as
a symbolic reference to consciousness eating itself, that those entities who
have worked in those organizations of that secret occult force for these eons
of time, whereby these forces have used their secret knowledge to perpetuate
their own action, whereby these forces have used the power of money, the power
of communication and the networks of education to confuse and intimidate the
masses, to condition, to control and regiment the masses, whereby these forces
have moved for these eons to time to categorize and identify the masses into
those smaller and smaller portions of experience into those more confined
areas of being, into those greater and greater mechanics of regimentation,
those forces have now reached that point whereby they begin to come face to
face with their own excess, with their own over-specialization, and have reached
that point whereby in their own over-specialization they are bursting through
into the oblivion of the bottomless pit.
This Awareness indicates there has occurred
that moment in time whereby those forces of the occult, those forces which
have moved from that area called Origani, those forces which have been moving
in those areas of control throughout many eons of time, these forces which
have been moving into and through Atlantis and from Atlantis up to the present
time, those forces which have been used the principle of control in order
to maintain and perpetuate their own actions and their own concepts, those
forces associated which that which is structure, the hierarchy system and
that which is known as the Luciferian system. This Awareness
indicates those forces have reached that point in time, whereby through the
Law
of Paradox they have come face to face with their own being and
have now begun to devour themselves even as the mythical serpent devours its
tail.
Chaos carries
with it total bliss and harmony
This Awareness indicates that this
action at this time as that which does lead to chaos, but the "chaos"
does carry with it total bliss and harmony.
There is always that which is the opposite of that which appears to be
This Awareness suggests the Law of Paradox as that which assures that there is always that which is the opposite of that which appears to be. This Awareness indicates that in reference to the action of controls and order that this is that which is undergoing a great change, and whereby those who are attentive attempting to create a greater degree of order through regimentation, through identification and through categorization that these are those who shall find their action come to naught.
Melting
and disappearing into the universal chaos of universal harmony
This Awareness indicates that these
energies of these occult forces which created that which is known as the hypnotic
stupor under which mankind has lived, these forces which have created that
which is the frozen consciousness, these forces which have created structures
through the controls of authorities over those who are obedient followers,
these forces are those which are diminishing, melting and disappearing into
the universal chaos of universal harmony.
The only possible
way for entities to survive
This Awareness indicates the temperature
as heating up and entities holding such structures and the structures themselves
are beginning to crumble and melt even as scrap iron structures are melted
when temperature rises enough. This Awareness indicates that from the chaos
there shall emerge that which is a system of communication which shall allow
entities to govern themselves without leaders with only the switchboard which
does coordinate every important movement and the energies to be exchanged.
(Pause) This Awareness indicates that chaos is coming on all levels that the
only possible way for entities to survive and continue their own action is
through giving attention, sensitivity, love and affection to one another.
This Awareness indicates that as governments begin collapsing, as the money
system begin to fail, as the controls begin to fall, there is no power that
remains except that which is used in communication and service from one to
another.
This Awareness indicates that is
the preparation for that which is to be the New governing system, which does
not govern entities but rather allows that method whereby they may communicate
their need and their service to one another whereby there may be mutual and
open communication of equal to equal, whereby there may be those who are capable
of accepting responsibilities yet are not seen as leaders, whereby there are
those who choose not to be responsible for any other than themselves and yet
not to be cast off as detrimental and useless.
Whereby entities may do that
which they choose and that which they choose may be acceptable as part of
the social order, whereby the order is based on that which is a natural process,
a reflection of higher laws, (rather than on those contrived, artificial laws
which are created by the imagery of those who would control a situation) whereby
the movement of these natural laws are in harmony with the chaos known as
the universe, and wherein these natural laws can be flexible enough to change
and flow from universal moment to moment energies; this as that which does
begin to come together in this year of 1976.
This Awareness indicates that the
action of those who are involved in
the Illuminati, the action of those involved
in all of the branches and actions of that organization, the actions of those
who are involved in the oppositions to those organizations, these actions
will all begin yielding and surrendering to one another in an action of some
compromise, whereby a reconciliation between two polarized forces begins to
take place. This begins with an action of approximately 5% reconciliation
on the part of each of these organizations and on the part of the individuals,
whereby that which is set in absolute certainty is receding 5%, and in that
receding of all those 5% there comes about a total change of vibration on
this plane.
This Awareness indicates this melting of consciousness, the melting
of those structures and forces and those certainties of mind which have held
entities trapped in concepts for eons of time, as now bringing about a change
whereby the evil is not as evil, the good is not as good and the joy becomes
overwhelming for those who experience this. This Awareness indicates that
in the moment of these currents of ecstasy which are flowing in on this plane
many entities will be swept up and deposited in these state of bliss. Those
who cannot move in the currents of ecstasy may be swept under into the memory
of past joys.
This Awareness indicates that there
shall be a moment in consciousness toward the action of looking toward a gathering
of new forces and of finding a way whereby entities may create a type of order,
that is based on communication, rather than on authority. This Awareness indicates
this as that which is called the United States of Awareness and this shall
be given in time by this awareness, This Awareness suggests there shall be
a call for astrologers, to assist on this, that the need for certain types
of entities capable of occupational classification, who are capable of working
with astrologers in this action and others shall also be involved in this.
This Awareness suggests the interpreter be brought out of trance at this time.
