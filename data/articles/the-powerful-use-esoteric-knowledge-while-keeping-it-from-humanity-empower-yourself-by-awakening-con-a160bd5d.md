You should be active in your spiritual life.
Youre never going to discover why you exist,
and what the purpose of your life is, if you dont do something about it. Do
you want to live your life superficially, or do you want to have a genuinely
spiritual life?
Reading, discussing, watching
videos and belonging to groups might be helpful to begin with, but
ultimately its not going to get you there. If you want to have a rewarding
spiritual life youre going to have to
EXPERIENCE.
It doesnt matter what you think about
consciousness, higher truths or
different dimensions, its what you experience and what you are that
counts.
Planes of existence beyond this world exist,
there are higher beings, heavens and demons, and hell is real; Ive been
there. Ive seen realities that cant even be imagined or dreamed about.
Wake up and see for yourself
whats really going on. Be more conscious in your life and learn from
the dimensions beyond this. But watch out, because youre ingrained in a
passivity that will stop you, and you dont even realize it.
That passivity is ingrained into the
subconscious in all of us by society, and by the feelings and emotions that
are part of natures program, which we were born with.
This will drag your inner state down when you
try to elevate it to spiritual states, it will make you search for pleasure
and satisfy
animal drives, it will keep your life stuck in this plane of existence,
locked on a mechanical track with few choices, and you wont even know its
there.
Esoteric Knowledge is Used by the Few and Denied
to the Many

and a hand sign symbolizing
three sixes.
The passivity has developed over time to the
extent that the human race has effectively become domesticated and in many
cases resemble passive sheep.
Unfortunately, pleasure is a powerful driving
force, and when people live for pleasure many compromises have to be made.
Not the least is a reluctance to attend to the things that really matter.
Corruption sets into society,
greed becomes a virtue, the environment is frivolously destroyed, there
are huge differences in the distribution of wealth, etc.
People have less inclination towards serious
issues and are more willing for others to do things for them. Other people
and institutions then
make many of their decisions for them. With the result that a huge
number of people are only able to understand simple slogans, and are thus
able to be manipulated by those in power.
And, in terms of spirituality, the tendency is
to follow the herd and accept what they have been brought up with or what
others do without any deep questioning.
But
spirituality is far too important a subject to leave up to someone else,
or to have as a blind belief. Its an individuals fate beyond this life
thats at stake and thats a very high stake not to take a serious interest
in.
If you look for knowledge far enough youll
discover a maze of ideas, but are likely to come across some information on
out-of-body experiences and symbols. The two are related since the
language of the astral plane is in symbols.
By learning to have out-of-body
experiences, youll be able to learn much more of what life and the universe
is about. But youll also start noticing that symbols from the astral plane
are everywhere in society.
They are in movies, in the logos of
corporations, in ancient art, in music videos, public buildings, religions,
theyre all over the place.
So,
Suppressing Higher Knowledge
The all-seeing eye within a
triangle
as used in the emblem for an intelligence agency.
The answer is that its suppressed knowledge,
its powerful and enabling.
Those in power want to restrict its use and
dont want it falling into the hands of the majority.
The establishment wants to have control over it. Many powerful
institutions throughout history have not wanted people to have it. Thats
been the basis of persecution of many people in the past.
It was part of the reasons behind the
inquisition, the witch hunts, the brutal suppression of early Christian
knowledge by the church, and the suppression of many individuals and groups
through the history of the world.
Those
behind religions dont want anything
new to arise to challenge their religion.
Society wants conformity, and profound spiritual knowledge doesnt
conform, its usually developed by small numbers of people who dont fit in.
The result is that esoteric knowledge basically
has been wiped out of societies repeatedly, and yet there are groups at the
higher levels of society who obviously have some kind of
knowledge of esoteric symbols and ritual and a wider esoteric knowledge
too.
But youll often find this knowledge is
inverted, its of darkness and is being used as a vehicle for power and
evil.
Dark symbols, landscapes and
themes
used in the music industry.
For most people though its taboo to even talk
about higher spiritual knowledge in many places, if you were to try talking
freely even about a simple subject such as astral projection you might get a
lot of negative responses.
Higher spiritual knowledge is demonized in many
ways in society and has been for a very long time. And yet its darker
aspects are so common in the music industry and Hollywood, most people take
it as fiction, but not all of it is, and I believe there are agendas behind
its use in the entertainment industry, some working
to affect people at a subliminal level.
And being used to direct peoples ideas and
attitudes in ways the media, and influences behind the media want them to
go.
This gives an extraordinary level of control
over people and thats not healthy.
Not All Secret Societies are Bad
There have been many types of secret esoteric
societies, some were created for sinister purposes, some out of religions to
further their agenda. Some were created with good intentions, and some today
have well meaning people in them doing good.
Not everything esoteric or occult is from the
dark side, fundamentalist Christians often label everything esoteric as
Satanic, but its not, some of it is actually a remnant of white ancient
knowledge. Some societies began as fully fledged esoteric orders, but became
watered down with time, lacking people with sufficient
inner awakening to participate in them.
Many of these became infiltrated by dark forces
as people motivated by greed and power took control of them. Their original
good intentions hijacked to fulfill sinister purposes.
It is necessary to have levels of secrecy in
many areas of life, in some areas of government for example (assuming the
government is working for the benefit of its citizens). Esoteric societies
used secrecy out of necessity for their own protection.
Have a look at a video of Gurdjieffs Meetings
with Remarkable Men, look at the levels of secrecy (at 1:20:00) in it, towards the end theres a secret esoteric school. They needed that secrecy to protect
themselves from people who would have destroyed their school.
Not everything secret is bad, esoteric knowledge
has been protected by hermetic silence. You cant have something like this today, people
would ruin it.
Pearls are not given to swine, as Jesus said, or they will
trample them underfoot.
The Use of the Word 'Cult' to Stop People
Forming Groups for Higher Spiritual Knowledge
The cult word today is being used as an
instrument of suppression and it restricts your freedom.
If you take an interest in something spiritual,
say
astral projection, and you get together with a group of interested
people, and they elect you to be the head in some way, youll immediately be
classified as a cult leader and your group as a cult.
And if someone attends and they dont like you
they can lie about you in public and be supported by a huge number of
institutions, religions, groups of abusive anti-cult witch hunters,
atheists, the media and society in general, and if you look for justice
youll find its priced beyond the reach of ordinary people.
How are you going to withstand that? Your life
will be ruined.
The media fuels the witch hunt, the sheep in
society follow, and the bullies attack.
Society is not free. People with agendas control the media, and this is
rotten. Heretic, blasphemer, witch, pagan, cult, these are all bigoted words
meant to shut people out of society and destroy them.
There are always
lawbreakers in every aspect of society including spiritual groups, but they
are the minority and there are laws to deal with them.
But the actions of a few become the brush to tar
the many with.
A poster for the EU
containing upside down pentagrams
and an image that bears a
striking resemblance to
the tower of Babel (mentioned
in the Bible) in construction.
What does the word cult make you feel? Bad?
Thats part of your programming.
Even Jesus, Mohamed, the Buddha would be called cult leaders
if they were alive today. Those with agendas pulling the strings behind
the scenes dont want you to study esoteric knowledge, they dont want you
to form groups around it.
They dont want challenges, at a deeper level,
the forces of darkness dont want the forces of light to emerge to counter
them.
They dont want you to become
empowered by consciousness and wisdom. Behind the scenes they manipulate
the media to make you believe these things are wrong, but they are not.
You have a right to gather with others to stand
together and face this ignorance, to fight for truth and to know the secrets
of esoteric knowledge. You should empower yourself with truth and
become active for the good of society.
Statistically the most persecuted religious
minority in the western world today are not Jews or Muslims, they are modern
Pagans.
Society is not free...
Spirituality has been Commercialized
Upside down pentagram used in
the emblem of a police force.
A pentagram the right way up
is a symbol of light (signifying a person ascending to heaven).
Forces of darkness use this
symbol by inverting it and thus attracting the powers of darkness.
While some spirituality is not allowed one type
is encouraged, that is commercial spirituality.
The
alternative health and lifestyle industry in the US in 2006 was worth
$300 billion dollars. Thats where your interest is being funneled. True
spiritual knowledge is given for free, youre being deceived.
The figures of commercial spirituality are not
spiritual teachers they are celebrities, their messages are simplified and
watered down to the extent they are misleading.
They often fish other peoples ideas and present
that work as their own, they are talented writers and speakers, but they are
businessmen and women, supported by a
highly sophisticated industry.
If you have a spiritual message to share, but
youre not up to making money for these corporations, youll be ignored.
The Source of the Suppression of
Knowledge in Society
Religion, lots of different interests,
corporations, individuals and groups combine and organize to create the
world as they want it and work behind the scenes. Ive been attacked by some
of them.
Its been going on for a long time in society.
Its my experience that there are people of a
religious persuasion who are able to go into the astral plane, they have
awakened psychic faculties for evil, and they go into the abyss where they
get their knowledge, they access the intelligence of evil. This is the
source behind the evil that is manipulating so much of the world today.
This spreads like the roots of a tree from
secret mystical societies through the
upper scales of
power and influence in society, until its influence permeates the lives
of the unsuspecting majority.
Darkness has its hierarchical structure, which
goes through society, to a small number of initiates of darkness, then
through the hierarchy of evil out-of-the body to demons and the forces of
darkness.
A hierarchy of light also exists, but THE HIERARCHY OF LIGHT IS BROKEN, it
has been smashed and does not reach society.
One of the results of this is that the different
ventures of truth and good in the world have little or no understanding of
the esoteric principles of life, lacking that common understanding they are
split, weakened, dissipated and often become infiltrated by dark forces.
Darkness has virtually won the war for the human
race.
A Global Awakening is Not Happening in
Consciousness
A pop star mimics a character
from the old film Metropolis
in which a woman was created
to destroy men
through sexual desire
using entertainment.
Notice the upside down
pentagram - used to summon the forces of evil.
The pop star then proceeds to
strip out
of the robot suit and dance
scantily clothed before millions of people.
A lot of people today talk of there being a
global awakening, but where is the awakening of consciousness?
People are more asleep now than ever, there are
no more
societies based around esoteric knowledge like there were in ancient
times, nor at this rate is there any chance of there ever being any. An
awakening of information about important things in the three dimensional
world, though good, is not an awakening of consciousness.
It may be that people are becoming more
conscious of several important issues, but people are not more awake in
consciousness, they are more asleep and are blind to the wider
reality of cosmic existence.
And dont be fooled by those studying
non-physical phenomena such as consciousness and the astral plane, who use
scientific methods to draw theories about what theyve never experienced.
Or who say that non-physical phenomena are
constructed by the mind alone.
The result of this will be to keep you from
searching for
higher knowledge while out-of-the body, while in life being immersed in
inaccurate theories.
Its great that people search for truth in
society, each human being has a responsibility to work for the forces of
light in the struggle against darkness, but becoming initiates is even
better.
A small number of initiates of light in the
world could create a powerful force for good.
You Need the Astral Plane to Understand
Secret Symbols and Ancient Knowledge

down crucifixes
and doing a symbolic gesture in covering their eye
- creating the all-seeing eye.
Most of the symbols in use today have their
origins in the symbols of the distant past.
Its unfortunate that so many people have taken
wrong direction when it comes to understanding
ancient knowledge, but its not surprising considering the suppression
that has been going on for so long.
When studying ancient cultures people draw all
kinds of theories about their symbols, but they dont understand that they
are looking at the symbolic universal language of
the astral plane, probably
because they have seldom if ever been there.
Some interpret them as tales of evil
reptilians
and codes of evil societies, but without understanding that without esoteric
knowledge, you cant interpret the more profound meanings in the
symbols of ancient civilizations. Nor can you get esoteric knowledge
without finding it beyond this three-dimensional world. And no one can get
profound esoteric knowledge without becoming an initiate.
Esoteric symbols are the language of the astral
plane, and that is their origin, just as it is the location of,
ghosts,
demons, angels, divine beings and much of the
paranormal.
Ancient peoples used the astral plane for knowledge and
brought back its symbolism for use in their teachings and temples.
Evil people become initiates of darkness and
thereby get access to knowledge of evil. Initiates of light get access to
knowledge of light. Ordinary people get ordinary knowledge = dull.
There are ascending serpents (light) and
descending ones (darkness), get knowledge and dont fall into the trap of
drawing conclusions from ideas that have no esoteric experience behind them.
Its easy to do that, but youll just stay blind to higher truth, even if
you fight for truth on a physical level.
Fight for truth on all levels and
empower yourself with white esoteric knowledge.
The Sleeping Majority Whose Destiny is
Out of Their Hands
The consumer society with its indulgence in the
lifestyle of greed has its price, in the suffering and destruction that
follows to people, animals and the environment.
But it has a higher more subtle cost in
enslavement to the many corrupt structures and people that exist in
society.
And an even greater enslavement which is of the dumbed down sheep
like existence of a person whose consciousness is asleep, who drifts through
life in a semi-comatose state, oblivious to the wider universe around them,
with a Santa Claus like view of cosmic reality, which
they call religion.
The average person is a person who doesnt know
why they exist, nor what the purpose of their life is, its a person who
dies and whose destiny is out of their hands.
Who moves on a circuit of lives from one to
another until the last life is over, then submerges into the abyss (look up
hellish
near-death experiences if you want to get some idea about this). The
majority of people dont want to wake up and dont want others to wake up.
Ignoring esoteric knowledge has a cost, a very
high one. Its much more difficult to discover and even talk about higher
universal truths than it is to explore the truth behind events that happen
in society.
But its necessary to find them if you want true
knowledge.
Know the Truth and the Truth Will Set You
Free
If you dont do enough to discover higher
truths, you wont get them, the best you can do is to get glimpses here and
there, and try to be content with that.
Why not be one of the few that wants
to discover more about whats going on, and be completely free in mind and
consciousness?
The problem is in
making the sacrifices to do it, facing opposition from the many forms of
the forces of darkness, and enduring the hardships of the way.
The hardships are the testing ground of life;
were all in creations testing ground, and thats why were here. Darkness
enables us to see form, and opposition is necessary for awakening. And yet
the difficulties of life are a major reason there are very few people
actually trying to self-realize.
Study yourself, get knowledge from outside the
physical world, become
an initiate of light and go through an esoteric process of change.
Be aware of what traps you, be strong and set
yourself free.
The world destroyed a man, but the man
became a serpent and lay hidden in the womb of the cosmic mother. But
darkness beware, because the serpent rises to one day reach the light
and be devoured by the eagle.
And then the feathered serpent can fly.
