A page from a longer listing
of secret Ferdinand Marcos bank accounts - including the White &
Case Trust account with Southeast Bank in the name of Marcos crony
Roberto Benedicto. Note also the Adnan Khashoggi accounts at the private
Swiss banks of Lombard Odier & Cie and Corraterie Gestion Coges.
The latter is where Marcos' personal private banker worked.
Other notable hidden Marcos
accounts were with HSBS, Citibank, Chase, BNL, Standard & Chartered,
Security Pacific - the bank where the MidAval-Dan Hughes Hammer transaction
appears to have been "back doored." Banque Paris, also listed,
is said to have been heavily involved in black gold transactions.
