About the Author
Andrew M. Lobaczewski was born in 1921 and grew up on a rural estate in the beautiful pied mountain vicinity of Poland.
Under the Nazi occupation he worked on the farm, was an apiarist, and then a soldier of the Home Army, an underground Polish resistance organization.
After the Soviet invasion of Poland, the family estate was confiscated and the owners driven out from their old house.
Working hard for living, he studied psychology at Yagiellonian University in Cracow.
The conditions under "Communist" rule turned his attention to the matters of psychopathology, especially to the role of psychopathic persons in such a governmental system.
He was not the first such researcher who followed a similar path.
The work was begun by a secret understanding of scientists of the older generation, which was destroyed shortly after by the Red security authorities.
Lobaczewski then later became the one who succeeded in accomplishing the work and putting it down on paper.
Working in a mental hospital, than a general hospital, and in open mental health service, the author improved his skills in clinical diagnosis and psychotherapy.
Finally, when suspected by the political authorities of knowing too much in the matter of the pathological nature of the system, he was forced to emigrate in 1977.
In the USA he became engulfed by the activity of the long paws of the Red diversion. Instead of his very hard times, the work presented now was written in New York in 1984.
All attempts to publish this book at this time failed.
With broken health, he returned in 1990 to Poland and went under the care of doctors, his old friends.
His condition improved gradually, and he became able to work and to publish another of his works in matters of psychotherapy and socio-psychology.
He is still living in his homeland.
