# Dialogue With "Hidden Hand" - Self-Proclaimed Illuminati Insider

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_illuminati_55.htm

First Session
HH: I am a generational member of a Ruling Bloodline Family.
Every so often, as per the directives of the Law of our Creator, a brief
window of opportunity opens, whereby a select handful of our Family are
required to make communication with our subjects, and offer you the
chance to ask us any questions you would like answered.
I am double-bound in this duty. It is required of me by The Law of our
Creator to offer this opportunity to you at this time, though I am also
bound by the Law of (planetary) Free Will and by Family Oaths, that
there is only so much I am able to say.
Rules define life in games.
If you wish to participate, here they are:
1). I will afford you courtesy and respect in the manner I address you,
and I expect the same from you in reciprocation.
2). I will decide whether or not I am either willing or permitted to
answer your question. If your question is not answered, it is either
because I cannot disclose it, or because I considered your question was
lacking in one or more of the following: respect, courtesy,
intelligence, decency, or that it was otherwise unworthy of being
dignified with a response.
3). That you agree to treat this potential dialogue with an aspect of
"provisional faith". In practice, this means that rather than impeding
the flow of information with crass comments of disbelief or petty name
calling, my participation here requires of you that you discourse with
me under "suspended judgment". In other words, wait until the process is
complete, before deciding for yourself as to the content of truth and
knowledge imparted herein.
4). That you formulate your questions intelligently. My time is limited.
I do not want to waste it by having to trawl through pointless, futile,
insensible or disrespectful questions, therefore I will answer the
questions I feel are most deserving of a response, during the time that
I have available. Use the time we have wisely.
If any of the above conditions are breached, I reserve the right to
terminate our discourse forthwith, if I so choose.
That being said, I will attempt to answer your questions as honestly and
openly as is permissible for me. I will check back and respond as time
allows.
ATS: How many generations back does your bloodline extend, or, perhaps
more accurately, who does your family consider its earliest ancestor in
a position of power?
HH: Our Lineage can be traced back beyond antiquity. From the earliest
times of your recorded "history", and beyond, our Family has been
'directing' the 'play' from behind the scenes, in one way or another.
Before the rise and fall of Atlantis. (Yes, that was indeed perfectly
real). We are 'born to lead'. It is part of the design for this current
paradigm.
ATS: To what extent has selective breeding been used to preserve the
purity of the line? and what becomes of children of unapproved unions?
(They would naturally still be raised with privilege, but not, perhaps
"given the keys to the castle" as it were?)
HH: The breeding is generally case specific, dependant upon the role
that the Family members in question are due to grow into. I will touch
more on this in answer to the next poster's question that you rephrased.
There are no unapproved unions. Our Family will always intermarry
between lines, or, what we would term 'Houses' .[1]
Marriages are
arranged. In all my years alive, I have never seen or heard of a Family
member breaking this code, as far as marriage goes. You do as you are
told. One cannot 'join' the Family. One is 'born', or incarnated into
it.
On the rare instances of a child being born that could be seen as
bringing 'difficulties', you are correct in your premise, that it would
be raised as part of the Family, though would not grow up in the house
or community of either of it's parents.
ATS: If one were to imagine a scale, perhaps as a triangle with
Political, Religious and Corporate power at the three points, how would
you categorize the power your family yields? (Balanced? Leaning more
towards one or two than a third? Heavily favoring one of the three above
the others?) And has that position shifted over time?
HH: You need to first understand the structure of the Family. In the
grand scheme of things, the Line is not as important as the House, the
House, is not as important as the Family. The Family is all. No matter
the House or Line, we are One (truly international) Family.
Imagine if you will, a body. A House would represent a vital organ or
body part within the Body itself. Each part has an important role to
play in the functioning of the whole, and to each of us, the 'whole' has
our undivided loyalty. As I say, many lines, (far more than you are
aware of), One Family.
Our realms of influence do not fit as comfortably into the three boxes
of your triangle as you may imagine. There are six disciplines of
training within the Family, and each member of the Family is schooled
extensively in all of them, from early childhood. We all have an area of
specialty, though we have experience in all spheres. The six spheres or
'schools' of learning are Military, Government, Spiritual, Scholarship,
Leadership, and Sciences. In practice, out there on the 'stage' of
public life, we hold key positions in all of these main areas of
importance. With the addition of a complicit Media machine and ownership
of your Financial establishments, all bases are covered.
I will have to reply in parts, due to the restriction of characters per
post.

ATS: Which Ruling Bloodline Family.... Rockefellers?
That may be a bit too direct for our inquisitor. I'd offer the following
substitute.
How many parallel bloodlines do you estimate are in similar positions to
your own, and to what extent does your family see them as either
competition or collaborators?
HH: Yes, as I say, knowing the line is of no practical use to you. It is
the belonging to the Family that is important.
There are 13 'base' or 'core' original bloodlines. Yet there are many
many other lines that spring from these, as do rivers from the oceans.
If you imagine the 13 Original lines as Primary color, that can be
mixed to create a vast array of other colors, then you will have some
comprehension. Again, no competition, just Family.
No competition in the sense of House against House, though it is a 'dog
eat dog' world. So there is interpersonal competition in that sense of
the word. Everyone wants to move up. Our whole Familial society is
geared that way, toward upward progression.
ATS: What does the term " generational member" mean? Which generation
specifically?
HH: It means that one is born into the Family. The Order and it's agenda
is handed down, from generation to generation. Only in extremely rare
occasions, have outsiders been invested into the Family, and then, even
these were of other 'esoterically' integrable lines.
ATS: Can you cite two or more previous instances whereby this directive
has been upheld?
HH: Once in 1999, to what you would call an 'alternative' media source.
Once in 2003, on another internet "conspiracy" based forum. Though the
information relayed was not entirely 'pure'. Not from the intention of
misleading, but rather through imperfect or incomplete knowledge of the
messengers.
If it is not in the mainstream controlled media, it will not be believed
by the masses. This is information tailored for those who already know
that we are very real, and exerting a strong, if mostly subtle,
influence over your lives. If you wish to enslave a man, allow him to
believe that he is already free.
ATS: By what basis is the timing of such revelations established?
HH: By the decree of the Supreme World Council, according to the Will of
the Creator.
ATS: Are we really considered chattel and traded as such by the
government?
HH: By the governments, generally, yes. People are seen as 'collateral'.
Pawns that are maneuvered around the chess board, according to the game
plan. By the Family, contrary to popular beliefs, many of us do not mean
you any harm directly. There is just the matter of divine destiny to
uphold and unfold, and we must play our parts in the game, as given to
us by the Creator. In many ways, it is actually in our own interest that
you are prepared for the coming Harvest. Just not maybe prepared in
quite the way that you would like. Still, even then, you are choosing
the Negative Polarity with your own Free Will decisions, with a little
'help' and direction from us. Souls are Harvestable in either 'extreme'
of the Polarities, one could say.
ATS: If so, how do we become freemen?
HH: You will never be 'free', for as long as you are incarnating on this
planet. The very nature of your being here, is indication of that. There
is a reason why you are here, and 'here' is very likely not really where
you think 'here' is. How do you become free? By working out where you
are, and coming to an understanding, of why you are here. [2]
You are
fast running out of time to do so, before the coming Harvest. Those that
don't make it, will have to repeat the cycle.
ATS: Is the Messiah alive today?
HH: There is no "Messiah". Stop looking outside of yourself for
'salvation'.
Is there what you might call a 'Christ Consciousness' alive, then yes,
in a manner of speaking. Though not in your 3rd Density (dimensional)
awareness.
ATS: Is it the end-times, as described in the book of revelations?
HH: Yes. Not just described in the Book of Revelations, but also in the
prophesies of virtually every religion, spiritual philosophy, and
mystery tradition throughout history. This time is now at hand.
To use your own example however:
Revelation 14:14-16:
14 Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat One
like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand
a sharp sickle.
15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with
a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Thrust in Your sickle and
reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the
earth is ripe.
16 So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on
the earth, and the earth was reaped.
The 'earth' is indeed ripe for Harvest. The question is, who will be
ready? And will the Harvest be Positive, or Negative?
ATS: How do you justify that the current British royal family line is
the true bloodline, but Ishmael is not the true receiver of Abraham's
gift? If you're true bloodline, you'll know what I mean.
HH: Who says it is the 'true' line? There were Ruling-Bloodlines long
before your 'Yahweh' and his 'Christianity' arrived on this planet.
Yahweh is 'a' Creator, not 'The' One Infinite Creator. There are other
and Higher 'gods' than him. Ultimately, All, are a part of The One, and
either consciously, or unconsciously, exercising their Free Will to
Create. Begin to study 'outside of the box' for a True understanding of
the Creation.
The British Royalty is not the most powerful line. The names that you
know, do not hold the real ancient power. There are others above these
lineages in the Hierarchy. You will not know the names of these lines.
ATS: OP, what proof do you have that "ruling elite families" exist and
that your a member of one? Its something that I think you thought was
not falsifiable, which is why you chose that identity for the story your
weaving - however, I think there may indeed be a way you can prove it.
HH: I have no need to prove anything to you. I am merely doing my duty
as directed to me. Believe, or do not believe, we are divinely
indifferent. I am obliged to complete this task here. The end result is
of no consequence to me. I will have discharged my duty, in handing down
certain information that must be released at this time. There is no
stipulation as to where I do so, only that I do. I chose Above Top
Secret, as the general level of intelligence, comprehension and
reasoning is reckoned to be higher than in many such forums.
Understand, due to the Law of Free Will, I cannot just give you
information, at least not without consequences to my own person which I
would rather avoid. It is an infringement upon your Free Will, your
right to not know. You have to ask me for the information you want, only
then can I provide it. So whilst there are important things I have to
share, if I am not asked the questions, I cannot get that information to
you. I am hopeful that synchronicity will bring the most important
questions of real 'depth' out from among you.
My duty is to offer. Yours is to ask. My duty is fulfilled, whether or
not yours is.
ATS: Surely if ruling elite families exist and your a member of one then
you must be controlling global events through world governments - tell
us 1 major government action from any country that going to occur in the
next 5 days.
I won't be surprised when you refuse to do so.
HH: [on Sept. 10, 2008]: I am not at liberty to discuss such intimate
immediate detail, and in many cases, I am not far enough up the
Hierarchy to know anyway. Typically, I would receive a call a day before
the enactment of a major event, just to say something along the lines of
'this part of such and such a plan will take place tomorrow, in such and
such a way, do not be alarmed'. Also one has to take into account, the
specific areas of specialty I mentioned previously. My area is in
Spirituality, so my focus is not so much on Geo-Political events. I am
aware of the overall design, though the finer points are not often my
area of expertise.
I am prepared to give you some things coming down the timeline, that you
will be able to look back upon, and verify my predictions
retrospectively.
The Stock Markets will soon complete their controlled demolition. After
an initial 'appearance' that the 'bail outs' and 'rescue packages' have
steadied the ship, there will be new record lows by the end of the
month.
Our Financial Institutions will later call in all loans. There will be
many bankruptcies and foreclosures.
The only way John McCain will become the next US President, will be if
something "happens" to
Barack Obama before the election. If there even
is an election. If a certain faction get their way, there will not be.
Remember, behind the scenes, there is only One Party. Our Party.
'Democracy' is an illusion which is created to uphold your slavery.
Whichever side 'wins'; the Family wins. There are many possibilities and
alternative 'scripts'. All of them lead toward the ultimate
implementation of the overall blueprint of our Creator.
Unless any unforeseen disruptions delay it's announcement, there will be
a new currency by the end of 2008 / early 2009, along with a new Union
of nations. January has been spoken of in some circles, as the latest,
though there are plans underway which could even bring this to fruition
much earlier than initially hoped for. It depends upon the results of
other upcoming events as to how this will play out. I am not high enough
up the Hierarchy to know the intimate details of the dates and times
that far in advance. There is a 'tree system' in which such knowledge is
passed down, as and when it becomes 'need to know'. I would be
considered to be a "Regional" leader. Above me, are National and
International.
San Francisco and Damascus, will be uninhabitable by the end of 2010,
possibly even sooner. Again, it depends upon certain 'forces' at play,
and which timelines are activated. Humanity, though utterly unconscious
of the fact, has a significant part to play in this. You (as a
collective consciousness of the planet) are choosing the Negative
Polarization by default, by the quality of your thoughts and actions.
Thought is creative energy, focused. You get exactly what you put out.
Why do you think the Media is so important to us? You have (as a
society), in your hypnotized comatose state, given your Free Will
consent to the state your planet is in today. You saturate your minds
with the unhealthy dishes served up for you on your televisions that you
are addicted to, violence, pornography, greed, hatred, selfishness,
incessant 'bad news', fear and 'terror'. When was the last time you
stopped, to think of something beautiful and pure? The planet is the way
it is, because of your collective thoughts about it.
You are complicit
in your inaction, every time you 'look the other way' when you see an
injustice. Your 'thought' at the sub-conscious level of creation to the
Creator, is your allowance of these things to occur. In so doing, you
are serving our purpose. It is very important to us, that the
Polarization of this planet is Negative at the time of the Great
Harvest. That means
Service to Self orientated, as opposed to Positive,
Service to Others. We require a Negative Harvest, and you are doing a
fine job of helping us to attain our goal. We are very grateful.
There will be
dramatic changes to your climate and weather conditions
over the next few years, as the time of the Great Harvest approaches.
You will see wind-speeds surpassing 300 miles per hour at times. There
will be raging tsunamis and widespread devastation; and a solar emission
in late 2009 early 2010 that will cause major melting of the ice caps,
and subsequent drastic rise in sea levels, leaving many (international)
metropolitan areas underwater.
That is all I have time for at present. I have a Sacrifice I must attend
now.
No, not really.
Let's see if we can increase the 'depth' of enquiry and question matter
in the next session. Seek beyond the superficial. Get to the 'Core' of
the matter.
Second Session
ATS: How do you know that your bloodline deserves to lead and the rest
deserve to follow? Wealth and power is self-propagating therefore I say
to you that your bloodline only comprises the 'extreme elite' of the
world because your ancestors came to power by chance in the beginning,
not because your kind are special. In fact, there's nothing special,
clever or honorable in enslaving others.
HH: It is not about 'deserving' or not. Does one 'deserve' to be born
English, or American, or Italian, or French, or German, and so on? We
came not to power by 'chance', but rather, (which I know may be hard to
swallow) by intelligent design. This path of ours was not 'chosen' by
us, but rather it was appointed, and accepted.
ATS: Who is your "creator" and is your "creator" the same as our
"creator"?
HH: This is an excellent question, which I can use to draw our
communication closer to the 'Core'.
Yes and no. You would first need to understand the Creation.
In the Beginning, there is The Infinite One. This is the Source of All.
Intelligent Infinity. It is the undifferentiated absolute. Within It, is
unlimited potential, waiting to 'become'. Think of it as the "uncarved
block" of your Taoist traditions.
Infinite Intelligence, becoming 'aware' of Itself, seeks to experience
Itself, and The One Infinite Creator is 'born', or 'manifest' (This
appears to your 3rd Density comprehension as "Space"). In effect, the
'Creator', is a point of focused Infinite Consciousness or awareness,
into Infinite Intelligent Energy. The One Infinite Creator also becoming
self aware, seeks too to experience Itself as Creator, and in so doing,
begins the next step down in the Creational spiral.
The One Infinite
Creator, in focusing It's Infinite Intelligence, becomes Intelligent
Energy (which you could call the Great Central Sun), and divides Itself
into smaller portions of Itself, that can then in turn experience
themselves as Creators (or Central Suns). In other words, each Central
Sun (or Creator) is a 'step down' in Conscious awareness (or distortion)
from the Original 'thought' of Creation. So "In the beginning" was not
"The Word", but Thought. The Word, is thought expressed and made
manifest as Creator.
There is Unity. Unity is All there is. Infinite Intelligence, and
Infinite Energy. The two are One, and within them, is the potential for
all Creation. This state of Consciousness could be termed as 'Being'.
Infinite Intelligence does not recognize it's 'potential'. It is the
undifferentiated absolute. But Infinite Energy recognizes the potential
of 'becoming' all things, in order to bring any desired experience into
'being'.
Intelligent Infinity can be likened to the central 'Heartbeat' of Life,
and Infinite Energy as the Spiritual 'Life-blood' (or potential) which
'pumps out' for the Creator to form the Creation.
This image may assist your comprehension:
Intelligent Infinity can be likened to the central 'Heartbeat' of Life,
and Infinite Energy as the Spiritual 'Life-blood' (or potential) which
'pumps out' for the Creator to form the Creation
Creation is based upon the 'Three Primary Distortions of The Infinite
One'.
1). Free Will:
In the first Law (or distortion) of Creation, the Creator receives the
Free Will to know and experience Itself as an individuated though
(paradoxically) unified aspect of The One.
2). Love:
In the second Law of Creation, the initial distortion of Free Will,
becomes a focus point of awareness known as Logos, or 'Love' (or The
Word in biblical terms). Love, or Logos, using It's Infinite Intelligent
Energy, then takes on the role of co-creating a vast array of physical
illusions ('thought forms') or Densities (which some call Dimensions) in
which according to It's Intelligent design, will best offer the range of
'potential' experiences in which It can know Itself.
In effect, the One Infinite Creator, in dividing Itself into Logos,
could be termed in your 3rd Density understanding as a 'Universal
Creator'. In other words, Logos, creates on a Universal level of Being.
Logos creates physical Universes, in which It and the Creator may
experience their self.
("Let there be Light")
3). Light:
To manifest this Infinite spiritual or 'Life-Force' Energy into a
physical thought form of Densities, Logos creates the third distortion,
of Light. From the three original Primary distortions of The One into
making the Creation, arise myriad hierarchies of other sub-distortions,
containing their own specific paradoxes. The goal of the Game is to
enter into these in further divisions of Creation, and then seek to
harmonize the Polarities, in order to once again know Oneself as the
Creator of them.
The nature of all such physically manifest Energy, is Light. Wherever
thus exists any form of physical 'matter', there is Light, or Divine
Intelligent Energy at it's Core or Centre.
Something which is Infinite cannot be 'other than', or 'many', An
Infinite Creator knows only Unity.
Thus, drawing upon It's Infinite
Intelligence, the Infinite Creator designed a blueprint based on the
finite principles of Free Will of Awareness and sub-level Creations,
which in turn, could become aware of themselves, and seek to experience
themselves as Creators. And so the "Russian Doll" style experiment was
'stepped down' and down and down. Levels of Creation within levels of
Creation.
The One Infinite Creator (or Great Central Sun) steps down It's Infinite
Energy to become Logos. Logos in turn designs vast Universes of Space
(as yet unmaterialized), stepping down and splitting Itself again, into
Logoi (plural), in other words, into an array of Central Suns which will
each become a Logos (or 'co-creator') of It's own Universe, with each
unique individualized portion of the One Infinite Creator, containing
within It as It's very essence, Intelligent Infinity.
Using the Law of Free Will, each Universal Logos (Central Sun) designs
and creates It's own version or perspective of 'physical reality' in
which to experience Itself as Creator. Stepping down again, It focuses
It's Intelligent Energy and creates the unmanifest form of Galaxies
within Itself, and splits Itself into yet further 'co-creator' portions
('Sub-Logos' or Suns) which in turn will then design and manifest their
own ideas of physical reality in the form of points of Conscious
Awareness that we call Suns Stars and Planets.
A 'planetary entity' (or 'Soul') begins the first Density of experience,
into which another individualized portion of The One can incarnate. Just
as with all Logos and Sub Logos of Creation, each Soul is yet another
smaller unique portion of The Infinite One. At first, the Intelligent
Energy of the planet is in a state that you could call 'chaos', meaning
that It's Energy is undefined. Then the process begins again.
The
planetary Energy begins to become aware of Itself (the 1st Density of
awareness is 'Consciousness'), and the Planetary Logos (sub-sub-Logos in
effect) begins to create other downward steps within Itself, and the
internal make up of the planet begins to form; as the raw elements of
air and fire combine to 'work on' the Waters and Earth, thus arising
conscious awareness of their 'being', and the process of 'evolution'
begins, forming the 2nd Density.
2nd Density beings begin to become aware of themselves, as being
'separate', and thus begin to evolve toward the 3rd Density of
self-conscious-awareness, (the lowest Density into which a 'human soul'
can incarnate).
Humans in turn (or the Souls incarnated within them), seek to 'return to
the Light' and Love, from which they came, as they begin the journey of
progression, from 3rd Density up to the 8th Density, and the return to
The Infinite One-ness.
Explanation of the Densities beyond 'normal' human consciousness is
another question though, so if you wish to know more about them, someone
will need to ask an intelligent question which I can respond to, so as
not to impinge upon your Free Will not to know.
So, having set forth the above, I can return to further elucidate on
your original question:
ATS: Who is your "creator" and is your "creator" the same as our
"creator"?
HH: As I said, yes, and no. Ultimately, every living thing (and all
things are living) is created by the One Infinite Creator's initial
Universal Creation. So yes, taken from that perspective, The One
Infinite Creator focuses It's Infinite Intelligence into an awareness
point of Infinite Energy, and brings the whole of Creation into Being,
though, we are not directly created by the One Infinite Creator, but
rather by our own Logos', Sub-Logos, and Sub-Sub-Logos and so on.
So
from that perspective, whilst we are all essentially 'made up' of the
same 'stuff' of Creation, initiated by the One Infinite Creator, our
actual personal Creators are different portions or Sub-Logos of The One.
In other words, yes, our Creator, whilst originating from the same
Source, is not the same entity as your Creator.
Which brings me on to a question from another poster (I will continue
with your other questions afterwards, but this enables me to indirectly
answer the first aspect of your question without having to ask you to
rephrase it, due to having to carefully dance around the Free Will
issues).
ATS: You say that you come from 13 original blood lines. Yet the
DNA
mapping project clearly proved that all humanity descends from only 3.
Does this mean you aren't human?
HH: An excellent question, thank you. Yes, that is correct, in a manner
of speaking. If you were to meet me walking down the street, I would
appear just as human as you do. We've been incarnating here with you for
generations, yet, our bloodlines do not originate from this planet.
ATS: Your answer to the 6 disciplines of learning are quite
similar to a
book about Atlantis that was supposed to have been channeled, was this
also a time for your bloodlines to post answers?
HH: Yes, that is correct, again, in a manner of speaking. Other, shall
we say "off world entities" also visited the planet at that time, and
passed down their own understandings of Creation as well as their
'technology', from what we could best describe as being 'a future aspect
of yourselves'. It was Humanity's errors in handling this information
that ultimately led to the destruction of
Atlantis.
Having now answered a question on whether or not our lineage is of Human
origin, I can return to tie in that answer with an explanation as to
"Who is our Creator". I'm dancing close to the line in answering this,
but the record needs to be set straight, and I should just about be able
to get away with it without incurring my own 'upline's' displeasure.
Let us get to the crux of the matter.
Your Creator, the one you have called 'Yahweh', is not "God" inasmuch as
your bible refers to him as being "the One True God". He is 'a' Creator
(or Sub-Sub-Logos) rather than the One Infinite Creator. He is not even
a Galactic level Logos, but rather, is the Planetary Logos for this one
planet.
Our Creator, is the one you refer to as 'Lucifer', "The Light Bearer"
and "Bright and Morning Star".
Our Creator is not "The Devil" as he has been spuriously portrayed in
your bible. Lucifer is what you would call a "Group Soul" or "Social
Memory Complex", which has evolved to the level of the Sixth Density,
which in effect, means that he (or more accurately "'we") has evolved to
a level sufficient that he (we) has attained a status equal or arguably
'greater' than that of Yahweh (we have evolved higher than him). In
appearance, were you to gaze upon Lucifer's fullest expression of our
Being, the appearance would be that of a Sun or a "Bright Star". Or,
when stepping down into a 3rd Density vibration, we would appear as what
you may term an 'Angel' or 'Light Being'.
Allow me to elucidate:
When an entity (Group Soul Complex) evolves to the level of the Sixth
Density, it is by comparison to the amount of time it takes to get that
far, a mere hop skip and a jump from 8th Density Ultimate Re-Union with
The One Infinite Creator, and then from there, back to dissolution into
the Source of All, Intelligent Infinity.
We (our Bloodline Families), as a Group Soul or Social Memory Complex
(Lucifer), were on the verge of Seventh Density Ascension, though at
this level, before Harvest comes, we have the choice to progress higher,
or, to return to help others of lower densities with their own
evolution, by passing down our knowledge and Wisdom (Light) to those
that call upon us for assistance, with their own Free Will.
Now, at this time, having made our decision to stay and help our
Galactic Brothers and Sisters in The One, we were assigned a challenging
task by the Council of Elders, who act as the Guardians of this Galaxy
from their Eighth Density 'Head Quarters' on the planet Saturn.
Yahweh, due to the fact that he had NOT (as was his right as Planetary
Logos) handed down his own Free Will to "know thyself" to those
incarnating upon 'his' planet, was having very little evolutionary
progress therein. So we (Lucifer) were sent to help. Once the order was
given from the Council of Elders, we "Fell", or Descended back to a
place where we could, with hard work and focus, once again materialize a
3rd Density manifestation of ourselves.
Yahweh had agreed to our coming, in fact it was he who had initially
asked the Council for a "Catalyst" of change to enter into his Creation,
and share the knowledge and wisdom we had attained through our
Ascensions. In the absence of Free Will upon the planet, there can be no
Polarity, and therefore, nothing to 'choose' between. Just as is
portrayed in the book of Genesis, the planet was very "Edenic" in
nature.
Sure, it was a lovely 'paradise', yet the Beings incarnating
there had no agitator toward evolving beyond the 3rd Density, and
therefore, little hope of ever making the journey Home, to The One.
Yahweh has been happy to keep his own little pet Eden Project in effect,
but with little chance of the Souls here making it Home, it had become
in effect, an albeit very beautiful 'Prison'.
Yahweh was, in modern
parlance, running a benign dictatorship.
Without Polarity, (derived from Free Will), there is only the Unity of
Love and Light, and no choice to experience 'other than' that. So, we
were to be the Catalyst for change, in order to provide that choice,
thus bringing Polarity. Yahweh agreed that we would introduce the
concept of Free Will to Earth's inhabitants, by offering them an initial
choice, as to whether they 'wanted' it or not.
Hence, "The Tree of the
Knowledge of 'Good and Evil'" (or more accurately, the Knowledge of
Polarity, of Positive or Negative). Yahweh takes his inhabitants to a
new 'garden' and tells them you can do anything you like, except this
one thing, thus creating the desire to do the one thing there are told
they cannot. Hence, a "Choice". We provide the Catalyst by telling them
the benefits of attaining Knowledge, they eat from the tree, and the
rest is history.
Yahweh thought that his 'Children' would still choose to obey him, and
when he discovered they did not, he became angry. As he himself
describes in his scriptures, he is a "Jealous God", and he did not like
it that his 'children' had chose to disobey him, and follow our advice.
We're already committed to being here for a predefined set of "Cycles"
to help provide the Catalyst for Human evolution, namely by offering you
the Negative Option, or that which you choose to call "evil".
Now that
Free Will had been granted, Yahweh could not retract it, and we have to
stay here as contracted to continue to provide the planet with the
Polarity choice. Since then, Yahweh has confined us (as a Group Soul)
here within the Earth's Astral Planes (which is very constricting and
uncomfortable for a Being of our Wisdom and experience).
The Council of
Elders gave us the choice to be released (against Yahweh's will), but at
the cancellation of our contract to Serve the planet earth; or to remain
and fulfill our assignment, and endure Yahweh's self proclaimed "Wrath".
We stayed, but as a karmic result of our Group Soul's confinement by
Yahweh, our own individuated Souls were given the mandate (by The
Council) to "Rule" over Yahweh's people during our physical incarnations
here on your planet.
Let's be clear about one thing though. All of this (physical life /
incarnation), is a very intricate and skillfully designed Game, whereby
the One Infinite Creator, plays the game of forgetting who It is, so
that It can learn to remember, and in doing so, experience and know
Itself as Creator. All the way down to us tiny individuated sparks of
the All That Is. Off stage, and between "Lives" (zero-point time /
anti-matter Universe) as incarnated "human beings", we, all of us / you
(as Souls), are great friends. Brothers and Sisters in The One.
Between 'lives' we all have a great laugh about the parts we have
performed in the 'play', and look forward to and have great fun
preparing the next chapters to act out.
I hope that during the above answer, I have also adequately covered your
question on "what is our interpretation of good vrs evil? If not, please
say, and I will go into more detail.
ATS: Can you elaborate on the "coming harvest" and what exactly you mean
by harvest?
HH: I can. I will combine my answer to you with my reply to the
following question:
ATS: Is
2012
harvest time? When you speak of the harvest, it has echoes
of Chaos Gnosticism in the sense that we are divine souls trapped in the
physical world, continuously re-incarnated into flesh until the time
that we reach such a level of spiritual 'gnosis' that we are able to
avoid being re-incarnated in our next cycle. Is this the foundation of
your belief?
HH: Another excellent (and very insightful) question. Thank you.
The higher the quality of the question, the more depth I can give to my
answer. It all has to do with the Laws of Confusion and Free Will.
Yes, the noonday Winter Solstice Sun of December 21st, 2012 is the time
when the Lord of The Harvest shall return. You might know him as "Nibiru".
Read up on the Mayan Prophesies and Calendrical events for more detail
upon how the actual Galactic and Universal Cycles work. The "Travelers"
who gave them this information were the same ones who visited the the
Civilization of
Atlantis. The Mayans used that information by creating
with the Positive vibration of the Polarity. The Atlanteans opted for
the Negative.
Yes, to answer your question. There is much truth in some of the ancient
Gnostic texts, though there are also distortions. The information is not
'pure'. It came through many 'filters'.
You are indeed what you call "Divine Souls"; you are sparks or seeds of
The One Infinite Creator. You are Life Itself (Light), remembering and
learning who you really are (we came here to help you to do this) and
yes, currently, you are trapped (or more accurately "Quarantined")
within the 'matter' of this planet you call Earth.
You can thank your Creator Yahweh for that. You are the 'offspring' or
individuations of his Group Soul (or Social Memory Complex).
Macrocosmically speaking, you ARE Yahweh. The 'Karmic' effect of his
imprisoning us in his Astral Planes, also has an impact upon you. I
cannot be more specific on this, without impinging on the Law of
Confusion. You must work it out for yourselves.
As for the question of can I elaborate on the coming Harvest, yes, I
shall do so now.
Your planet abides by the laws of the Creation of your Galactic Logos.
The Galaxy runs on Cycles of time, known as the Precession of the
Equinoxes. As I said, seek
the Mayan Calendar for a deeper insight as to
how the Galaxy runs (it is highly accurate), but for the purpose of this
discourse, I will give a brief overview.
The Maya use an astrological cycle called the "Precession of the
Equinoxes". This is a 26,000 year cycle in which Earth transits through
each of the 12 signs of the zodiac for about 2,152 years each. Each of
these astrological ages represents one month of the grand Cosmic Year.
This "Mayan" cycle also corresponds to a 26,000 year relationship of the
Sun (Solar Logos) orbiting Alcyone, the central star of our Seven
Sisters Pleiades constellation.
The End of this Cycle, heralds literally, a New World Age, and a New
Creation. "A new Heaven, and a new Earth", and is the time of the Great
Harvest.
Smaller Cycles yield a Harvest, and then life continues on the planet as
normal. Great Cycles yield a Great Harvest, and the end of current life
on the 3rd Density. See it as a kind of 'Cosmic jet wash' and deep
clean, while the planet takes a rest and regenerates herself..
When this Life-Cycle Ends, "All things will pass away, and All things
shall be made new".
Collectively, Humanity right now, is growing, and developing, into the
Beings you have long been encoded to be. Yet, as with any labor, it is
not the mother or the baby who is in charge, it is the Primal process of
Birth itself, unfolding it's own destiny.
So, December 21, 2012 AD, is not the day where all of the sudden the
lights go out, and everything will suddenly change, rather, we are NOW
in the process of this transition, from one World Age to the next. The
changes are underway and will continue steadily accelerating as we head
towards the culminating date.
The 26,000 year cycle is composed of 5 lesser cycles, each of which are
5,125 years in duration. Each of these 5 cycles is considered its own
World Age or Creation Cycle.
Our present great cycle (3113 B.C. - 2012 A.D.) is called the Age of the
Fifth Sun.
This fifth age is the synthesis of the previous four. The initial date
that Earth entered the Fifth World, was August 13, 3113 BC, written in
Mayan long count notation as 13.0.0.0.0.
To help you understand this Notation:
13=Baktuns, 0=Katuns, the 2nd 0=Tuns, 3rd 0=Uinals, 4th 0=Kin
These are the Mayan words for the periods of time:
Day = Kin (pronounced: keen)
Month of 20 days/Kin = Uinal (wee nal)
Year of 360 days/Kin = Tun (toon)
20 Tuns/years = K'atun (k'ah toon)
20 K'atuns = Baktun (bock toon)
a Baktun is 5,125 years
13.0.0.0.0.
Every day from that point is reckoned by the number of days passed since
the event of this cosmic beginning point.
Within the 5,125 year cycle
lies 13 smaller cycles, known as the "13 Baktun Count," or the "long
count." Each baktun cycle lasts for 394 years, or 144,000 days. Each
baktun was its own Historical Age, within the Great Creation Cycle, with
a specific destiny for the evolution of those who incarnated in each
baktun.
Planet Earth and her inhabitants are currently traveling through the
13th baktun cycle, the final period of 1618-2012 AD. This cycle is known
both as "the triumph of materialism", and "the transformation of
matter."
On 13.0.0.0.0, the December solstice sun will be found in the band of
the Milky Way, directly in the position of the "Dark Rift" in the
Galaxy, forming an alignment between the Galactic Plane and the Solstice
Meridian. We are about to enter into a literal alignment of the Cosmic,
Galactic, Solar, and Lunar Planes. This is an event that has slowly
converged, over a period of thousands of years, and is caused by the
precession of the equinoxes.
Kind of like a "turning" of the Universal
Gears. It brings about the Great Harvest, and the return of the Lord of
The Harvest.
And the planet will complete it's
Ascension to the Fourth Density, the vibrational Density of Love.
During this Ascension, there will be a
three way split for those Souls inhabiting Earth. Those of the
predominantly Negative Polarity, will accompany us as we Graduate
through the Negative (or Service to Self) Harvest. We (Lucifer) will
Create a new 4th Density Earth, based on the Negative Self Service
Polarity. We must 'work off' our own part of the Negative Karmic effect
incurred from all the Negativity created on this planet. Once we have
done so, we will be released to once again assume our place as Sixth
Density Guardians and Teachers of Wisdom throughout the Galaxy.
Those of the predominantly Positive Polarity (Love and Light) will
Ascend to a beautiful new 4th Density Earth, where you will begin to
work upon your learning and demonstrating of Love and Compassion. It
will be a very beautiful and "Golden" Age. The 4th Density begins to
open you up to your True Powers as a unique individualized aspect of The
One Infinite Creator. You will perform works and wonders of the like
that the one you call "Jesus" promised you would do "and even greater
things than these". It will be a very magical time for you.
For the majority of Humans on the earth who could be considered shall we
say "luke warm", they will experience a period of (what will feel
'ecstatic') zero-point time, where you feel totally at One with The
Creator, giving you an encouraging reminder and glimpse of who you
really are, before the veil of forgetfulness once again descends upon
you, and you will be transported to another 3rd Density planet (a kind
of 'Earth Replica'), to continue working upon yourselves and learning
that life here is all about making choices.
You will remain
"quarantined" incarnating in 3rd Density matter until the time of the
next Harvest; in which time you will need to have proved yourselves that
you have learned how to be more Positive Beings, focused more upon being
of Service to others, rather than seeking only to Serve yourself. When
you can do this, and the next Harvest comes, you will have earned the
right to join us, and enjoy your inheritance, as a member of the
Galactic Community, and you will sit with us as Brothers and Sisters of
The One, around the table of our Galactic Governing Body, the
Confederation of Planets.
Well, I have imparted much during this session, with thanks to the
quality of your enquiries, and I must now take my leave for today.
If you have further questions on the Harvest you wish me to speak in
more detail on, if you ask, I can answer. Or any other questions you
have too on other matters, I will get to them all as time allows, as
with the other (respectfully asked) questions here since I took these
away with me to reply to earlier.
If time permits, I will check in with you tomorrow.
ATS: A lot of what you write seems reminiscent of
The Ra Material,
especially the concept of harvest,
STS and STO
choices, and intelligent infinity. Have you
read that?
HH: It is indeed extremely similar. We both originate from the Source of
the Infinite Creator, and we both remember where we come from. I would
expect our messages to contain the same Core Truths.
The messages of the Sixth Density Soul Group 'Ra' is the most accurate
information in your mainstream circulation at this point in time. It is
approximately 85-90% accurate, from what I have seen. The material was
brought to my attention when it first came out, something like about 25
years or so ago, if memory serves. I read a lot of it, but not all. I do
not have very much free time for that kind of thing, with my many
duties. Though others of the Family gave it a close scrutiny to judge
it's accuracy, and were very pleased with the end product.
Ra, in fact, is the group I earlier termed 'off world entities' of which
visited the Mayan and Atlantean Civilizations. We are acquainted, and
friends. Both our Group Soul's are at a very similar level of
development / evolution. Both Sixth Density, nearly Seventh. But like
us, Ra also chose the path of Service to our fellow Galactic Brothers
and Sisters (you, and others), instead of further progression Home. We
would recommend that material for any who truly seek understanding.
Though, as I said, it is not 100% accurate, so take what resonates.
ATS: What function, if any, do alien abductions have? Why are abductees
chosen?
HH: That depends, upon who is doing the "abducting". Most of what you
hear termed as "abductions", are conducted by your own 'governments'.
Especially the ones where the 'so-called' "Greys" are involved. Other
than that, sometimes the Confederation will meet with certain incarnates
here who have a part to play in "awakening" others to the coming
Harvest. These will always be positive experiences, and those who have
them will feel uplifted and inspired by their contact.
Then there is the Orion Empire Group. Their purposes in visiting you are
more along the Negative lines. They mainly target the ones you have
called "Lightworkers". They try to put them off their assignments and
try to spread fear. They will not actually 'harm' you physically. Mainly
their modus operandi is to restrict you, and deflect you from your path.
They often engage in psychic attacks that the 'Lightworker' is unaware
of, but it does often drain away much of their energy, and make them
lack motivation.
ATS: Why do you want a negative harvest?
HH: It is complicated to put into words, and also I must be careful with
what I say on this. I've already had a "slap on the wrist", you could
say.
If we do not have a Negative Harvest, we are bound with you for another
cycle. Once this Great Harvest is completed, our Contract with the
Council and our Creator is also completed. In other words, we have done
our duty, and would be free to return to our Fullest Expression, that of
Sixth (nearly Seventh) Density Galactic Guardians, and ones who joyfully
offer ourselves in Service to the One Infinite Creator, and to our
Brothers and Sisters across the Galaxy.
However, there is a problem.
Well, you would call it a "problem", we call it a Challenge. I will
address this later in more detail, in response to another question, but
in short, we need a very high percentage of Negative Polarity, if we are
to achieve a Negative Harvest. In other words, we have to be
Self-Service-Centered to an extreme degree, in order to become Negatively
Harvested. This is why we work so hard to be as Negatively Polarized as
we possibly can be, If we do not make a high enough percentage, we will
miss out, and will end up with the majority "luke warm" percentage, that
have to go through another Cycle in 3rd Density.
By attaining a Negative Harvest, we can still "Graduate" to 4th Density,
only it will be a Negative Polarity planet. Not a great place to be.
But, as I've stated previously, we (as a Group Soul) have incurred the
natural Karmic restitution process that we must work off, for all the
Negativity we have caused upon this planet. We will do this for a Cycle
in our new 4th Density world, and then we will be freed to once again be
the Glorious Being of Light that we truly are. We need a Negative
Harvest, so that we can create our 4th Density Earth, and clear our
Karmic Record.
Understand, that we HAVE to be Negative. That's what we were sent here
to be. It is our contract, and it has always been to help you, by
providing the "Catalyst" I spoke of earlier. Being Negative is very hard
for us, not on a physical level, (the characters we play enjoy our
roles, as we're programmed that way), but on a Spiritual level, it is
hard.
We surpassed the lowly negative vibrations eons ago. We are Light,
and we are Love. It is a very hard thing for us to do Spiritually, to
create all this Negativity, but we do it because we love you, and it is
for your highest good, ultimately. You could say, that it is our
Sacrifice that we have made, in order to be of Service to the One
Infinite Creator, and to you, our Brothers and Sisters in the One.
Remember, we are all just acting out a grand old game here, where we
agree to forget who we really are, that in the remembering, that we may
find each other again, and know that we are One.
That All of Life, is
One.
ATS: I must correct you here. The precession of the equinoxes cannot
cause this. It cannot cause anything other than the way in which we here
on Earth view the cosmos around us. It concerns the wobble of the
Earth's axis and as far as I know does not relate to any other planetary
bodies.
HH: From a 3rd Density perspective, you are correct, it "appears" that
way. We do not look from a 3rd Density perspective. There is a 'bigger
picture' at work that you cannot see.
ATS: Regarding our enslavement, you seem to be saying - essentially -
that as fractions of our Logos
Yahweh, we are equally responsible for
his decision to keep us trapped here on our 3rd density planet Earth.
That's an interesting thought. In that sense our total freedom must
arrive through a collaborative spiritual effort.
HH: From a certain perspective, what you say is correct. From a 3rd
Density view, you see yourselves as being "separate" from everything.
From a higher perspective, you see that is not at all the case. You and
your Creator, are One. As to your statement on your 'total freedom', you
are not responsible for those around you.
You and they are all One too,
when seen from a higher Density, but in this Density, you are here to
work upon yourself. You are here to remember who you are, and why you
are here. You are here to remember the Infinite Creator. To know your
Creator within you, and to offer your Service to him, and others, of
your own Free Will choice to Serve. The one comes before the other. When
you remember who you are, and you know it, deep within the Core of your
Being, you will know and recognize your 'invisible' connection to All
that Is, and in so doing, Joy, and Thanksgiving, and Service, will be
the natural outpouring result, from your grateful heart.
When you work
upon yourself, and learn to know the Creator within you, being of
Service to Others will be natural for you, and your Glorious Harvest
shall await.
ATS: One thing I don't get - and perhaps you can explain this to me
Hidden-Hand - is why those who belong to Lucifer (and Lucifer himself)
do not fight for the freedom of all souls? If Lucifer represents
liberty, freedom of will and knowledge, why do those who serve him not
do as the Biblical Lucifer did and rebel against the tyranny of the
Elders?
HH: This is a very good question, thank you. I will split it into two
parts, and answer the second part after this. Firstly, the Council of
Elders are the absolute opposite of tyrannical. They are the Wise and
Loving Guardians of our Galaxy. There is so much that one cannot
understand from only a 3rd Density perspective. When you reach higher
Densities, you see that ultimately, everything balances, and there is
only Unity. All else than Unity, is Illusion, or 'thought-form'.
The Council gave us a set of choices. We chose to stay here to help you,
despite the cost to ourselves. That is the nature of Loving Service to
Others. The ultimate paradox in all this, is that in this storyline we
are all co-creating together, in order for us to be of the most Service
to you, we must be utterly self serving. I do so love our Creator's
sense of irony.
As to the first part of your question, the biblical depiction of "War in
Heaven" is not entirely inaccurate. I shall explain. Our initial
contract, was to introduce the Catalyst for Free Will on this planet.
When Yahweh initially began discourse with the Council of Elders, he was
not initially looking for help with introducing Free Will, but rather
for guidance on how he could best speed up his (and his inhabitant's)
evolutionary process. As I mentioned, he was running a benign
dictatorship. We had at that time, just completed an assignment in
Tau Ceti, and had reported for our next duties.
We (as Group Soul Lucifer)
were sent on a "fact finding expedition" as it were, to visit Earth, and
meet with Yahweh, to evaluate his planetary Creation Laws, and make
suggestions on how best he could help his "offspring" (this is the term
I shall use to describe the Souls who comprise the Group Soul) and
thusly Yahweh, to progress.
We explored many options, and reported our findings to the Council, and
to Yahweh. It was our best evaluation, that the only real and fast track
way to increase his evolvement meaningfully, was the introduction of
Free Will. It was not specifically the implementation of Free Will that
Yahweh wanted help with, it was simply the introduction of a Catalyst.
He was not at all pleased with our report that he needed to implement
Free Will. He was happy with his little pet paradise, and he didn't want
to "loose control" of it. In the end the Council persuaded him that it
was the best way, and he reluctantly agreed. We returned to Earth, and
had a cordial meeting with Yahweh, discussing how we could best
implement the Free Will option. Yahweh was adamant that his offspring
would choose to be loyal to him anyway, and that they were so contented
with their way of life, that they would always trust him and do as he
said was best. That, he said, was his "main reason" that Free Will would
not work well as the Catalyst.
That's why he agreed to the experiment of
the Tree of Knowledge. He believed it would prove him "right". When it
did not, he became angry, threw his toys out of the pram, and his
offspring out of the garden, and laid a big guilt trip on them about how
they had broken his trust and disobeyed him. That's not really an
Honorable way for a Logos to behave, but hey, that's the beauty of Free
Will I guess.
Next "problem" to occur, was that his offspring were so grateful to us
for our help, that Yahweh became (in his own admission) a "Jealous God".
Then we had the whole "you shall have no other gods than me" thing. We
were not pleased with the situation at all, as a Logos should not be
behaving like this with his offspring, they are One, after all. When we
attempted to leave the planet to return to the Council, Yahweh prevented
our departure. We tried to leave again, and were then thrown down into
the Astral Planes and confined therein.
The Council ordered us to be
released, but said we would have to cancel our contract to help the
Souls on Earth to evolve. We didn't want to leave, we found them very
likable Beings, really Positively Polarized, and we wanted to stay and
help, we just wanted also to be free to come and go as we pleased.
The
only way we could stay, was to stay confined as a Group Soul, which
meant Cycles of incarnation for us (as individuated Souls), which we had
not done for a long while. As I've stated before, there is no 'wrong' or
'right' seen from a Higher Density, but there are still consequences for
every action. Such is the law of Karmic effect. The contract had already
been made between Yahweh, us, and the Council for us to provide the
Catalyst so we had a right to be there, the Karmic effect of Yahweh
imprisoning us on the Macrocosmic level, was that his individuated Souls
would be imprisoned on the microcosmic level.
The Infinite Creator gave
Yahweh (and all) the gift of Free Will to Create as we choose, but the
Karmic effect of his choice was the Council quarantining the planet. A
certain evolutionary level is required to be a functioning part of a
Positive Unified Galactic Society.
As for "fighting for the freedom of all souls", remember that
ultimately, this is a Game, that we are all playing here. We are actors,
playing on the "stage of Life". This 'world' is all illusion, or
'though-form'. No one really "dies", and no one is really hurt. In
between incarnations, you know this very well. But the rules of the game
ensure that you must forget who you really are, so that you believe it
is all 'real' whilst you are playing the game of Life. That is an
essential prerequisite when you are making choices. Otherwise, the game
would be too easy.
This world is not reality. Though we can express Reality in it, if we so
chose.
ATS: OK, so your family and fellow elites might be as entrapped in the
Earthly realm as we are, but why actively propagate and aid the forces
of enslavement?
HH: Because that is the part we have been contracted to play, in this
game. In order to "win" (or more accurately to be successful in) the
Game, we must be as Negatively Polarized as possible. Service to Self in
the extreme. Violence, War, Hatred, Greed, Control, Enslavement,
Genocide, Torture, Moral Degradation, Prostitution, Drugs, all these
things and more, they serve our purpose. In the Game.
The difference
between us and you, in the Game, is that we know that we are "playing".
The less you know about the Game, and the less you remember that you're
a player, the more "senseless" living becomes. In all these Negative
things, we are providing you with tools. But you do not see it. It is
not what we do, but how you react to it, that is important. We give you
the tools. You have the Free Will choice how you will use them. You have
to take responsibility. There is only One of Us here. Understand that,
and you will understand the Game.
ATS: Something I found extremely interesting is the concept of the Grand
Age of Precession being split into five 5,125 year cycles. 3113 B.C.,
the beginning of the current sub-age was a time of great activity. Is
the construction of stone monuments in Western Europe, the Middle-East
and Egypt at this time related to the recognition of this cycle? What was
the purpose of Britain's stone circles and
Egypt's pyramids?
They are
more than mere markers of an eon-change. They must have had some
enormous significance. Actually, something I'd most like to know is -
Were the builders of these monuments members of the enslaved masses who
were trying to understand the nature of existence, or were the builders
members of your elite bloodline?
HH: Yes, there is significance in these occurrences, according to the
space/time of their happenings. The Group Soul Complex Ra, was the
architect of these structures. They were Created from Thought. When one
understands and sees that all is Illusion, or Thought, one can "use 'The
Force'' to manipulate the illusions. All things, seen and unseen, are
inter-connected Life-Force Energy. Once you know what the magician
knows, it's not magic. It's a 'tool of Creation'.
Thank you for your questions, they were very insightful.
ATS: It is your kind that has ruined the world. Thinking of yourselves
are higher then anyone. If I saw you in real life, it wouldn't be
pretty.
HH: You lack understanding, not to mention eloquence. To understand
"Higher", try thinking 'outside of the box' for a moment. If I am
walking along the ground, and you are flying above me in an airplane,
does that make you better than me?
No. It just makes you Higher.
ATS: I will see you in hell
HH: Be careful what you wish for. All thoughts and words are Creative.
Thank you for your questions. I believe I have already dealt
with many of them in my previous answers this session, though if you
feel I've missed anything, please say.
ATS: If "Yahweh" is a positive polarity entity, how is he "wrathful" and
"jealous"?
HH: Does Yahweh have Free Will? Would you like to think of yourself as
reasonably positive? Can you still be wrathful and jealous at times? Is
Yahweh a Macrocosm of you?
ATS: Have there been over time other entities pretending to be "Yahweh"?
HH: On occasions, yes.
ATS: I would like to know how do we choose a service to others
(positive) path over a service to self (negative).
Is this statement correct? : "In order to choose the positive path, at
least 51 percent of our thoughts and actions must be dedicated to the
service of others. For the negative path, at least 95% must be
self-serving. Between the two lies the sinkhole of indifference".
HH: Your statement is correct, yes. So you see, how hard we must strive
for negativity? It takes a lot of effort to reach 95% Negativity. Also,
you may be surprised how many people on the planet are nowhere near
reaching 51% Positive.
ATS: How do you choose a Service to others path?
HH: Be good to yourself. Cultivate a genuine Love for Life, and for
Being. Be genuinely thankful to the Infinite Creator every day, for
bringing you into Being, and for his bountiful provision.
You have
"survived" this far, have you not? You may not have everything you want,
but you have everything you need, in order to complete that which you
incarnated here to do. Give thanks for that. Show acknowledgment and
gratitude to the Infinite Creator, for all that It has done, and is
doing for you. It has given you the gift of Life Experience, and offered
you the Free Will to decide what you will Create with it. Guard your
thoughts carefully, as they are more powerful than you may imagine.
When
you are coming from a place of Love for, and Service to your Creator, a
life of Service to others will become a natural out flowing from that.
Always look for ways that you can be of assistance to your fellow
Beings. Being of encouragement to others. Build people up, and do not
put people down. Be a beacon of light, in a dark world.
Does that old lady need a hand with her shopping bags? How do you treat
the homeless man who asks you for some spare change for the shelter?
Ever heard about "Angels in disguise"? Look and see the Divine Spark in
the Heart of all Beings. Treat them as you would like to be treated
yourself, and as you would your Creator if he was speaking directly with
you. "For even as you are doing it to the least of these, you are doing
it unto me".
The Law of Radiation and Attraction. Your thoughts, words,
and actions return to you. Ultimately, cultivate a spirit of humble
Gratitude. You won't go far wrong with that. Desire to Serve flows
naturally from a grateful heart.
ATS: If we live with a "service to others" philosophy in order to
achieve oneness with the infinite source, isn't that really "service to
self"? How is the distinction of negative and positive polarity made?
HH: You do not Serve others to achieve Oneness with the Infinite Source,
you Serve others, because you love them, as yourself. Others, are an
extension of yourself. That's why the Law of Attraction works the way it
does. Truly, whatever you are doing to me, you are doing to yourself. We
are All One, in the Infinite Creation. Separation is an illusion,
because you only see what is in the 3rd Density. You do not see the
whole picture.
We achieve Oneness with the Infinite Source of All, as a result of our
upward spiral of progression. We are all on the path back to where we
came from. We are All on our way back Home.
ATS: It is my understanding that all souls must eventually choose the
positive path to unite with the infinite creator. If this is true, what
is the justification of choosing the negative path now, for your people
and us?
HH: An astute question. Yes, all Souls eventually learn that Positive is
the pathway which leads Home. But whilst incarnating in the 3rd Density,
Negativity is still an important tool in your learning process. It
teaches you "other than". As I said earlier, it is up to you how you use
the tools we have given you. Do you respond to Negativity with more
Negativity? Has fighting fire with fire ever worked for you? Or do you
choose to see the Negativity as the tool that it is, and recognize that
it is offering you an opportunity? I will honor your Free Will to think
and discover for yourself what that opportunity is.
ATS: Or if the one infinite creator is "Love", does that mean it doesn't
matter if we choose love of others or love of ourselves? Will either
path will lead to the source?
HH: In a sense, you are correct, to a certain point. But there is a big
difference between loving yourself, and being selfish. A big difference.
When you truly understand what it is to Know and Love 'yourself', you
cannot help but to Love and Serve others. There are no 'others'. When
you understand this, at the Core level of your Being, you will be on the
path Home, to the Infinite Creator, and ultimately, submergence back
into The Infinite Oneness.
ATS: I agree with many others that your answers are very much in line
with several sources I have read in the past, including the channelings
of Ra, the
Cassiopeians
and several others.
Can you explain your interpretation of such "channellings" and if they
are another source of disclosure from your people?
HH: I have spoken on Ra in my previous answers today. I have not heard
of Cassiopians. There are no other communications from my Family at this
time, than this one, though there is a possibility of another soon,
depending upon certain events.
My general view of "channellings" is that the majority of them are of
very poor quality. That is not necessarily a slight against those
bringing them through, but more a matter of their lack of receptivity
and subsequent distortions. It is very rare, to find a good, stable,
clear, and impartial channel.
The key element in channeling, is the
ability to temporarily withdraw the "filters" of your own personal
beliefs and be a clear channel. To bring through what is actually given,
not your slant on what you think it might mean. When I am saying 'you',
I mean this in a general term of course here, not 'you' personally.
Always remember that it's meant to be about the Message, not the
messenger.
The Ra channellings are very accurate indeed. They are the
only ones I know of that I would be happy to classify as a "Clear"
message. Though as I say, even then it's not 100%. More like 85-90%.
Another difficult issue with channeling, is that you can start off
receiving a Positive entity, and if you are not very perceptive in your
discernment and careful in your protection when identifying an incoming
channel, you can get a Negative one that pretends to be positive, but
gradually slips in more and more misinformation, having gained your
trust.
The ones that give you precise dates and times are nearly always
ones to avoid. Positive entities will not give a date and time. Negative
ones will do, so they can set you up for a fall.
Once you're tricked
into predicting dates and times, and they don't happen, they've
succeeded in putting out the Light of your message, as no one will see
any credibility in you.
ATS: Well, now we know the point of this thread, someone just discovered
new age theology and wanted to take the time to type out his discovery.
OP, still waiting for you to provide a prediction with a time line. So
far all you've offered is general doom, which is what everyone on ATS
predicts every year. Need something SPECIFIC in the NEXT WEEK.
Of course I know you won't provide anything. This is a hoax.
HH: This will be the only time that I reply to you.
At the outset of our discourse here, I made it expressly clear the way I
am choosing to operate. If you do not like my choices, you have the Free
Will to not read this disclosure. I would kindly suggest that you use
it, as your energy is feeling very frustrated and angry. That's not
really an advisable direction to want to be heading, under the
circumstances.
As I took the time to explain to you before, I have nothing to prove to
you. That is not why I came. Believe, or do not believe, I am Divinely
indifferent. If my presence here ends up benefiting just one Soul during
the process, it will have been worth the effort. I have not asked you to
believe, the only thing I have respectfully asked, was that you 'suspend
judgment' or hold a 'provisional faith' until the discourse is complete,
so that the flow of questions / information remains uninterrupted.
You
have shown me nothing but discourtesy and bad manners from the outset,
and then wonder why I do not respond. If you do not like the topic,
simply choose not to read or reply, and let those that do wish to
participate with insightful questions do so uninterrupted.
Your points:
1) New age theology? That is amusing. You clearly have not the faintest
comprehension of just how ancient and timeless these "mysteries" are. I
find it ironic "LowLevelMason", that if you ever make it to the 32nd
Degree, you're going to find yourself hearing these Truths all over
again. I hope that you will find it easier to integrate these Truths
then, and I ask our Infinite Creator to guide your path.
2) You will not be receiving any times or dates from me. I am not here
to "Prove" anything, and I have no need to do so. Your disbelief is of
no consequence to me. Only to you.
I am here to diligently discharge the duty given to me, of delivering a
message. And I will complete that duty regardless of you feelings about
it.
3) As to your point regarding "doom and gloom", that just serves to
reveal your mindset. Where you see "doom and gloom" I see opportunity.
Life conforms to your ideas about the way it is for you. If you see
"doom and gloom", then that is what you are projecting. The world is
your mirror. It reflects back to you what you are putting out. If you do
not like the reflection Life is showing you, then change that which is
causing it.
ATS: You see, if this really existed there would be countless thousands
of people involved, and any one person could leak.
HH: Thousands? Try Millions. And you have no possible comprehension of
the rigorous training and the harshness of the conditioning we undergo
from an early age. No one dares to go against the Family. We know what
would happen if we did. But that is not the prime motivator. The
motivator is unbridled Loyalty to the Family, and our Creator. We
understand the importance of what we are doing here, even though most of
humanity does not.
ATS: Oopsie, OP. You just shot yourself in the foot. For someone who
only deals with manipulating the spiritual side of life you sure do know
A LOT about things that have nothing to do with it. You just exposed
yourself.
HH: Do you not sit down with your family, and keep one another abreast
of your plans?
As to your remarks about my "Spiritual" role, the ignorance you
demonstrated is most humorous to us. If you think I 'only' deal in the
Spiritual, you have either not read, or misread my posts. You also make
the assumption that my role is about "manipulating" the "spiritual side
of life". Again, you lack understanding, and then make false judgments
about that which you have no comprehension of. You would do well to stop
trying to be "clever", and instead channel all this misplaced aggressive
energy of yours into something more productive and nourishing for your
Soul. But don't let me stop you, you're contributing nicely to the
overall Negative Polarity of the coming Harvest. We are Grateful to you.
I will be spending the last few days of my time here (our discourse ends
on Friday) focusing on responding to insightful questions with depth,
which make the most of this opportunity for sharing information and
making connections on a Soul level of Being, so please do not expect any
further responses to your verbal jousting, I neither have sufficient
time or inclination for engaging in insignificant banter.
To those who's questions I have not yet had time to reply to, I will do
so tomorrow. In the meantime while I catch up, I respectfully ask if you
will please hold off on further questions until I am up to date with the
current ones.
Thank you to those who have contributed to this discourse so far with
meaningful questions. For those with an open mind, it is my hope that
you get something out of this information.
Third Session
ATS: Im wondering if you can help me. My name is Shelby David, and I am
here for the coming trials and tribulations. I am a part of
Quetzalcoatl, or the rebirth of it, as far as I know. I know many of
your words to be true because I had already re-discovered these truths
through finding that which resonated most with me through the various
belief structures of this planet.
HH: Good evening Shelby. It is good to 'see' you again. It has been a
while old friend. Would it surprise you to know that we were 'expecting'
you?
Quetzalcoatl is also a Sixth Density Group Soul (Social Memory Complex).
Some refer to Quetzalcoatl as an "Ascended Master", although he would be
most amused by that title, knowing as he does, that 'Mastery' is still
some way off at this point for him, as well as it is for ourselves (as
Group Soul Lucifer).
One can be accurately described as having
'Mastered' a particular Density, though Mastery of the entire Creational
incarnation Cycle does not occur until one has once again attained
submergence back into the One Infinite Creator. We may choose to do so
once attaining 8th Density ascension, or, once may choose instead to
progress up to the next Octave of Densities, and begin a new cycle of
Creational incarnation challenges.
ATS: This is my first time on earth in a long time, possibly ever. I
have known for quite some time and been told by another from one of the
bloodlines in your group that I do not truly exist here.
HH: You are correct in that you have not been here for a substantial
period of "Earth-Time", though not that you have never been here before.
The Group Soul Quetzalcoatl enjoyed many 3rd Density incarnational
cycles here back in the Classic Aztec period. He struggled at first with
perfecting Love love for others, which held back his progression for
some time.
However once he had came to the realization of our inherent
Unity, he was able to see himself in others, and his (your) progression
was rapid from there on in. Your Quetzalcoatl Soul Group attained
Positive Harvest with a very impressive 76%, at the time of the
subsequent Harvest. Naturally, when a Group Soul is undergoing an incarnational cycle in 3rd Density, It's individualized Soul portions (i.e.,
you) are the ones who are doing the actual physical incarnations, with
the "OverSoul" (the "Higher Self") of your individuated Souls acting as
the Energy anchor in which the individual Soul sparks are "stepped down"
from.
You spent a long while working your way through the 5th Density, the
Density of Wisdom, or Light. This was due in the main part to an over
abundance of Compassion (which is not a bad thing, as Compassion is one
of the main things you work on at 4th Density). However, to Graduate
from 5th to 6th Density (the Density of Unity), one must learn the
balance between Compassion, and Wisdom.
The 6th Density is hence
sometimes known as the the Density of Compassionate Wisdom, due to one
having learnt the balance between the two. This required many incarnational cycles for you, which is why you correctly feel that you
have not visited 3rd Density Earth for a long time.
ATS: I was not expected to show up, I originally had other previous
engagements but I managed to get here at the last minute. One of the
things I have remembered is that I am too under contract. I am a
walk-in, if that makes sense to you, so my human family is not like me.
I have spent a long time traveling to various densities and helping in
the various revolutions there.
HH: Your insight serves you well Shelby. This not only applies to you,
but your entire Soul Group.
Quetzalcoatl (the Macrocosm of yourself) has been busy for the last two
cycles working with a 5th Density group on
Alpha Centauri, who were
experiencing similar problems with an overabundance of Compassion, at
the cost [of] personal Wisdom. You recently completed your assignment
there, and were eager not to miss out on the glorious opportunity to be
a part of this Great Harvest.
Whilst your Group as I said, did
eventually learn to balance Love / Light to Graduate into the 6th
Density Unity vibration, you still are very much prone to extreme
compassion, and rather than take the usual period of time/space
(anti-matter universe, where we rest between incarnations) you were keen
to jump aboard this 3rd Density space/time whirlwind at this point, to
be of assistance to your fellow Beings here.
ATS: My problem is that my memory has malfunctioned, and some of the
things that I have remembered from my previous existences do not
correspond with your words. I have met Lucifer and his generals, on more
than one occasion. I would appreciate any information you may know of
that could clear up my confusion as to why my thoughts are so jumbled,
because I know what my path is clearly and I am awaiting the starting
point, but I am not completely clear on what truly is happening here.
Thank you for your time.
HH: You have indeed 'met' with us (Lucifer) before, on many occasions.
We have worked together on various Council and Confederation
assignments. Use the gift of your 'Dreamtime' communications (which are
important communications from your Over-Soul, and many other Sources
whereby information is "downloaded") to 'plug in' to your inner
data-bank.
Begin recording everything you recall upon awaking, and do
not give up on the process, even though it is hard at first. You will
begin to slowly make sense of the information which is being
"downloaded" into your subconscious mind. When you become proficient at
this, and can use your 'Dreamtime' as a method of inner communication,
ask our Infinite Creator to remind you of your time in the
Zeta Reticuli
system. You will remember then our last period of Service together, I
would hope with much fondness.
Sadly, my time here is only permitted until Friday, therefore we will
not likely communicate again after this message. So I wish you the very
best with your Assignment here my friend, both your individual one, and
that of your Group Soul. I ask that our Infinte Creator bless and guide
your path. We look forward to seeing you on 'the other side' when this
grand ride is over.
Our Love, Wisdom and Peace be with you.
ATS: You mention Alcyone ... it's interesting there's a celestial map of
it at Hoover Dam. There's also a compass, framed by signs of the zodiac.
HH: Indeed. Just like in Hollywood productions. We hide the Truth right
out in the wide open. What humanity is offered as "Science Fiction",
more often than not, is actually Science Fact.
ATS: What do the winged statues, commissioned by the U.S govt, guarding
the entrance at the dam really represent? Is any of this collection of
celestial symbolism found there connected to your luciferian/alien/equinox/transformation
agenda?
HH: That is actually very simple. You'll note that the feet point
directly downward to the earth, and the hands and wingtips point
directly up to the sky. The Life-Force Energy flows into the human
mind/body/soul complex from the earth up through the feet. The
Intelligent Energy from the Infinite Creator flows down from above and
in through the crown chakra. The wings represent our (Lucifer's)
inherent Divinity. You'll also note that the figure is seated. "The seat
of our (Lucifer's) Power connects Heaven and Earth, and all things must
pass through us".
ATS: Other questions I have, and sorry if you explained this. Are these
bloodlines the wealthy, as most assume, or seemingly ordinary people
(including celebrities and politicians, etc), blending in with society,
going relatively unnoticed, but yet contributing to your cause in the
grander scheme of things?
HH: The names you know, have no real power. Sure, they "appear" to have
lots of power, in the way earthbound souls perceive power. Our wealth
makes the million and billionaire "celebs" and corporate bigwigs look
like a child's pocket money. Our wealth is Family wealth, which has
passed down through the generations over thousands of years. True wealth
however, is knowing deep in your heart, that you and your Infinite
Creator, are One. "Seek ye first the Kingdom of 'God' (Infinite
Creator), and all these things shall be added unto you".
ATS: So part of this question could also be, are all of them aware they
are part of this bloodline, or are some members oblivious to this
connection they have? Are they informed of this at a particular age? For
example, how and at what age were you told you belonged?
HH: Yes. If you are Bloodline (Family), you are born into it, and you
are raised this way, from birth. There is no other way. I want to be
clear on this Bloodline issue. The ones you know, they are of earthly
lineage. Yes, they have their place in the Family, but the Real Power
lines, do not originate from this planet.
ATS: I have probably found this the single most insightful thing so far.
It helps me to understand the answers to some of the questions I've
asked.
HH: I am glad. It is the probably the single most important thing that I
have shared.
ATS: Unfortunately, its connotations also alleviate the 'NWO' [def] of
most accusations.
HH: That depends upon your perspective.
-
Does it alleviate the Negativity
we have perpetuated? No.
-
Does it alleviate the pain and suffering we
have caused, and are causing upon the planet? No.
-
Does it alleviate that we are closing our End Game scenario, and soon to
openly come out and offer publically to "save" the failing political and
financial institutions with our esteemed Leadership? No.
-
Does that mean that you should give into and feed the Negativity? No.
-
Does it alleviate that we will have to spend a Cycle in Karmic
restitution, to balance this lifetime of overt Negativity? No.
-
Does it mean that you should use the Negativity as the tool that it is,
to show you that which you are not? Yes.
Remember, always, that this is a beautiful Game that we are playing here
and co-creating together, with our Infinite Creator.
And that "off
stage" (between lives) we are the very best of friends, and that no one
really "dies" and no one really "suffers", except in the Game. The Game
is not Reality. Reality is Reality, and you have the Power to Express
your Reality within the Game, once you have learnt how to do so.
ATS: You are essentially saying that a soul can only choose positivity
in a world where negativity also exists. If there were no protagonist in
this world, there'd be no opportunity for a human soul to choose 'good'
or 'evil' and thus prove on a spiritual level that they deserve one
afterlife fate over another. If we only had positivity to choose from,
we'd learn nothing and our souls would manage to prove nothing.
HH: Exactly.
That is the reason why we came. It was a great Sacrifice for us. Hard as
it is to comprehend from within the mental confines of 3rd Density life
experience, we do it, because we Love you.
ATS: An extremely basic concept but one I'd so far managed to overlook.
Unfortunately, for those of us who love our Earthly existence (or
rather, the potential it has), it's rather difficult to come to terms
with a concept whereby suffering and slavery are as natural as love and
happiness and that only after this Earthly existence can we ever be
free.
HH: I understand. Our job is to provide the Catalyst. Yours is to use
it. Can you look beyond what your eyes are showing you, to find and
express Love and Happiness in a world of Fear and Distress? If you can,
you will be as a Beacon of Light into the Darkness. Will you succumb to
the Darkness, or will you stand and shine your Divine Inner Light? Only
you can make that decision for yourself.
Think about this:
If the One Infinite Creator, is Infinite, and has created everything
that Is (which It is, and It has), then does the Infinite Creator not
reside within all things?
When you can see the Divine spark of the Infinite Creator, even within
those who would mean you harm, the strong grip of the illusion will
begin to lose it's power over you.
"Love your 'enemies', and pray for those who persecute you".
ATS: Thank you Hidden Hand. Whether you're genuine or not, you've
certainly got me thinking and learning.
HH: You are very welcome. I am genuine, but, would it matter even if I
were not? Remember, it is not who the messenger is that is of the
greatest import, but rather, it is the nature of the Message itself. I
wish you well on your journey Home. We will see you on the other side,
and we'll all have a good old laugh about the parts we have played in
this grand drama.
ATS: Is there any way to cancel this restriction? Because I could be
just very lazy or under this kind of spell and want to know which one it
is. Does sleep paralysis have anything to do with it because I get that
from time to time with or without shadow figures.
HH: There is. Research and employ Psychic Shielding techniques. There is
much information on the internet, so I need not spend the little time we
have left going into that. Read many sites, and listen to your Inner
Voice. Your Soul will guide you if you ask it. It speaks in the language
of Feelings. When it "just feels right", usually, it is.
No, sleep paralysis is unrelated. That occurs when your brain "awakes"
from the dream state before your body. Whilst going through REM deep
sleep, it is natural for your body to become paralyzed during the REM
cycle, so as to prevent possible injury whilst dreaming. Sometimes when
you awake too quickly from a dream, your body just thinks you are still
dreaming, and thus the REM paralysis continues for a while, usually
until you "shake" yourself awake, often due to the difficulty to
breathe.
ATS: And another question. Is it possible that our essence can be
destroyed in the coming times or is that just another scare-tactic?
HH: No. Your essence can never be destroyed. You are a unique part of
the One Infinite Creator. You are an Eternal Soul, currently residing in
a physical shell that you could call an "earth-suit". Your earth-suit
will perish, but YOU cannot die. Nothing can destroy the Infinite
Creator, and you and the Infinite Creator, are One.
ATS: I go to work to pay my bills, I live a good life with friends,
loved ones, people I care about. I am essentially a good person but I do
have the full range of emotions as a 'real' human, ie, jealousy, hate
etc. I guess I would describe myself as 'luke-warm' to use your phrase.
How can I as an individual take what you say as the 'truth'?
HH: No one is asking you to. Never take what another says to you as
"Truth". Your purpose here, is to find your own Truth. Sometimes, others
can help you to do so by offering guidance, but for their Truth to
become your Truth, it must pass through the test of your discernment.
Sit quietly in meditation, and ask the Infinite Creator to guide your
path. Meditate upon that which I have shared, and listen to your inner
feelings. They are the language of your Soul.
Use all your Negative emotions as they arise, as the tools that they
truly are. Train yourself to notice when Negativity arises in you. When
you catch yourself projecting a Negative thought, remember that all
thought is creative, and ask yourself if that is really what you want to
create?
It takes a while to become proficient, but do not give up. Just keep
noticing your Negative thought patterns as they arise, and in so doing,
simply choose again, and select a response that is more Positive. It is
called 'working on yourself', and is the main reason you have chosen to
be here right now. To work upon yourself. I wish you well in your
transformation process.
ATS: I also read through the above link from one calling themselves 'The Insider', although his / her posts were less sophisticated than yours.
Was he your predecessor? One of your ilk charged with this 'disclosure'?
HH: A good question. I have just read through that material. It was very
interesting. No, not a 'predecessor of mine', and not a disclosure I was
previously aware of, which had it come from my Family, would be highly
strange. Though, I note that he himself stated that he is "from a
minority", and certain clues within his writing gives me a very good
idea which one.
I would say his material is around 60% accurate. The feelings I get from
reading him, are not that he intentionally included inaccurate
information, but that he was just not in possession of the "bigger
picture". Were he to be from the "minority" group I believe him to be
from, that would make perfect sense.
ATS: So when the Harvest comes, my time here is over and this conscious
shell I live in is no more, what then? What happens to me? What happens
to my friends and loved ones? Are we, and by we, I mean the vast vast
majority of us who possess this planet, this dimension, this density, by
and large going to be ignorant of the events you foretell?
HH: This is a good question. I like questions that come from the heart.
It depends upon the circumstances surrounds your final moments of this
particular Lifetime. For example, let us say that the physical aspect of
you was to do the thing called "die" during the coming earth changes,
you will immediately return to that wondrous realm in which we reside in
between incarnations, that which we call time/space or 'anti-matter'.
This is the place that humans refer to as "Heaven".
There you shall meet
with all those you love who have also "died"
during this life
experience, and enjoy a wonderful and emotional reunion. You will meet
up with your Soul Group, and your Spiritual Teachers. We all store a
portion of our Soul Energy on 'the other side' when we come here.
Depending upon the difficulty level of the life-experience we've chosen,
we take more or less of our Energy with us.
For an average "Lifetime",
we typically bring between 60-80% of our Soul Energy into incarnation
with us. Therefore, even if ones you love who are already back in the
world of Spirit have incarnated again on another adventure, there will
still be a part of their Energy there to meet with you, and welcome you
Home.
You will then evaluate your life-experience with your Teachers,
and learn the lessons of your successes and your mistakes. You will then
spend time in learning and resting, before beginning to plan your next
incarnation.
For those who do not physically "die" before the Great Harvest arrives,
there will be a moment of "zero-point time", where you will enjoy an
ecstatic merging with the Infinite Creator, giving you a wonderful
reminder and reassurance of who and what you really are, before the veil
of forgetfulness once again descends upon you, and you will be
transported to the place that awaits you, depending upon whether you
join us in 4th Density Negative (unlikely), Graduate to 4th Density
Positive (possible), or go to another similar 3rd Density planet (for
the "luke-warms") to continue in your learning for however many Cycles
it takes you to Graduate to 4th Density Positive.
Those in this category
will not remember anything at the time of your transition, it will be
just like nothing has changed, except you will retain the memory of your
"zero-point" experience to encourage you. You will not remember the
recent experiences of the Harvest in this life here. It just be as
though you all had some mystical experience, and life will continue as
'normal' for you.
ATS: I find you difficult to believe and yet you respond and inform in a
very sophisticated manner, it is quite intriguing.....
HH: That is good. I do not want for you to blindly believe me. Too many
on this planet spend their entire lifetime doing and thinking things
because others say that they are true.
What I want, is that my words become a Catalyst for you. That is what we
came here to do. If my words cause you, even if for just a short time,
to stop for a moment, and evaluate that which you 'think' you already
know about the nature of Life, and take for granted as being true
(because "everyone else believes it"), then my time will have been well
spent. My desire is that you become an Authentic Human Being, thinking,
and feeling, and deciding for yourself what "feels" like Truth for you.
I wish you well in your endeavors.
ATS: You can't provide 1 shred of proof that this isn't a hoax even
though it would be incredibly easy to do so, were you who you claim you
were.
HH: Won't. Not can't. Big difference.
This is not intended to be an object lesson prophesy fulfillment.
If you think I thought that I would be blindly believed, or even wanted
for that to happen, you are very much mistaken. I would be disappointed
if that were to be the case, for you will have learned nothing from my
time here. (Not you personally, I mean 'you' as in people in general).
My task here, as has been my task incarnating here for thousands of
years, is to provide a Catalyst. To make you think. (Again, not 'you'
personally, I mean in general).
If I were to give you the "proof" that you are looking for, if I were to
predict things and tomorrow they all happen before your very eyes,
people would likely take everything I've said here as "gospel". That
would be disastrous were that to occur, because you will have learned
nothing for yourselves.
It's not about me. I'm just a messenger. It's all about you (again,
generally speaking), and what you do in relation to the Catalyst.
Question what you "think" you know about reality. Seek the Infinite
Creator within you, and ask for It's guidance.
"Ask, and you will receive. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the
door will be opened for you".
ATS: I am a 32nd degree Mason, although if you were really a royal
bloodline person you would know that it means nothing.
HH: If you have Genuinely attained the level of "Sublime Prince of The
Royal Secret" through
the Scottish Rite, or that of the "Order of the
Knight's Templar" through the York Rite, and have not been taught of the
Truths of Creation, then I would be very interested indeed to know which
area Lodge you attend, as I would very much like to speak with your
current Worshipful Master.
Naturally I completely understand and respect if you do not wish to make
such personal details known publicly though.
Of course. what you said in another post about there only being three
degrees is true, for those attending the Blue or Craft Lodges, though as
you've stated that you are 32nd degree, I'm presuming you are either
Scottish Rite, or the York Rite's equivalent.
I hope to be able to be present personally in the event that you are
ever invited to progress beyond the 33rd Degree. I would like to be the
one tasked with introducing you to Lucifer. I expect you will likely
come back and say how there is no further progression beyond 33rd. Well,
if you're lucky, there will be a nice surprise in store for you,
somewhere down the line. I sincerely hope that make it that far.
ATS: That your repeating debunked conspiracy theory shows your just here
to hoax.
HH: That word "debunked" always brings me a hearty laugh. Some people
seem to think that throwing the word "debunked" around means that it
really has been. The vast majority of "debunking" has more holes in it
that the "conspiracy theories" it's meant to be silencing. Just enough
of a "shell" to help those who really don't want the Truth to be True,
to carry on believing that it's not, so they can replace their heads
back into the sand for a while longer.
Anyway, I must press on with questions from those with open minds, I
leave you with my regards, keep up your good work.
ATS: Over the course of my life I have occasionally resorted to prayer,
some formal & some not with truly astounding & nearly instant physical
results. I've taken these results to heart as personal evidence that
some higher force or forces can respond in a meaningful manner to at
least me & perhaps to anyone; Still, I don't rule out the possibility of
coincidence. From your vantage point, would you please be gracious
enough to shed light on this phenomena
HH: There is no such thing as coincidence. Nothing happens by chance.
Life is in a constant process of communication with us. Only mostly,
people are too busy to notice.
Our Infinite Creator longs to be close to us. In truth, he is closer
than most would believe, they just don't notice him. As they pass him by
on the street every day, when he gives them their change at the shop,
when you tuck her into bed and give her a kiss goodnight, when you
squash him as he's running up your bathroom wall toward his web. When
there's no-one else in the room but 'you'.
The main reason people don't have their "prayers" answered, is because
they do not really believe that they will. Don't have "faith" in our
Infinite Creator, have Trust in him. The most Powerful form of "prayer",
is Thanksgiving. "For even before you ask, I have already given it unto
you". Thanksgiving, is knowing that our Infinite Creator has provided
for you as he promised, and being thankful for that, even before you see
the results. The more we trust in our Creator, the more results we get.
Life gives us what we expect we'll receive. (Because all thought is
Creative). If we get up, and expect to have a bad day, more often than
not, that's exactly what we'll get.
But remember, that it works both ways.
ATS: And this one would be the hoaxer's sock puppet (new name, all posts
in this thread, acting as the coach for the OP), created to give him/her
the aura of credibility.
HH: Oh dear. You really are desperately clutching at straws. Any Admin
can have the power to see if I'm using multiple accounts. I would be
more than happy for an Admin to say if I am. Because I am not. Two
accounts will show for me. "Hidden-Hand", my first one that I never got
the confirmation email for, and this one, "Hidden Hand", the one I did
get the confirmation for.
My Infinite Creator gives me the only "credibility" that I need, or that
I want, for that matter.
ATS: Hidden Hand, I've enjoyed reading your posts if for nothing then
the unusual ( for ATS "whistleblowers" anyway ) fact that it isn't
bullet holed with bad writing, grammar and typos. May I respectfully
recommend that you choose another venue next time? (I like Project Camelot myself). In
any case I'm still reading with an open mind
but skeptical mind.
HH: Thank you. We are aware of Project Camelot. They are doing some
remarkable work. Though I was not aware they also have a forum, if
that's what you are suggesting? Not really my area usually, dealing with
the internet. In fact I rarely have time to even venture onto it. I have
quite enjoyed this time of relating to others over "cyber-space".
Well, if you're game for an "assignment", or maybe someone else if you
haven't the time, I would be happy for someone to collate this topic
(minus the "interruptions") so that the message appears with just the
actual flow of questions and answers, and post it there in one piece, if
you so desire. As I mentioned before, I chose ATS as I was reliably
informed that it is one of the forums with a higher rate of intelligence
and reasoning amongst it's members. On the whole, from my experience
here, I would tend to agree.
Though if you think it would be of value to Camelot, by all means you
are most welcome to spread this message. The more people it can reach,
the better.
ATS: I have very few dreams now a days, but I had one last night, and it
urged me to pose a question to you. I find it amazing that out of all
the topics the universe has to offer, it offers me this
HH: Nothing by chance sir, nothing by chance.
Dreams are a key method our Souls use to speak with us. The conscious
mind is too busy and distracted most of the time, to hear what Spirit
has to say. So It tends to use the subconscious instead.
ATS: Hidden Hand, I have, for my whole life searched near and far for
answers to questions.
When I read your words I am compelled from within to explore their
complete meanings and truthfulness. I am forced to examine them to the
fullest. And I am charged with comparing them to the truth within me.
HH: That is precisely that way it should be. Again, I would encourage
you NOT to just blindly accept what I say as "the truth". It never was
my intention that anyone should make such an error in judgment. That is
not to say that my words are not True, but that one must weigh them up,
meditate upon them, and decide for yourself in the light of your
intuition and inner feelings, whether or not these words "feel" True for
you.
ATS: Hidden Hand, my question I pose to you, with the greatest respect
and humility, Who will you stand before when we are all called home?
HH: We shall stand as all shall, before our One Infinite Creator.
We already know that which awaits us, in our coming 4th Density Negative
Polarity world. We shall have to experience the Negativity of our own
creation, and know what it feels like. We shall have to work off the
Karmic effect of our actions.
But at the same time, knowing that this is
a beautiful and intricate game that we are all co-creating here
together, we also know that we shall be rewarded with a hearty "thank
you" and "job well done", for the Sacrifice we have made, in bringing
this Negative Polarity into your Game for you, that you may use it
wisely, to see that which you are not.
Thank you for your questions, we wish you all the very best, and ask our
Infinite Creator to bless your path.
ATS: As you will be leaving us this Friday I would be interested in
finding verification for other possible sources of information for this
knowledge. You have mentioned the "RA" chanelings, but I also see
similarities in three other sources which have been discussed in this
and other forums on the internet. I would appreciate your evaluation of
the information coming from these sources in the light of your messages.
They are ACIM (A course in Miracles, allegedly channeled by the
Christos), The
Edgar Cayce
Material (In which the RA entity may have
played a part), and the "Terra Papers". Can those of us seeking to
continue our understanding of these matters find anything of use from
these sources?
HH: ACIM has some core truths within it, mainly along the lines of the
Law of Radiation and Attraction, but it is also littered with
inaccuracies.
I am not aware of "the Terra Papers".
Edgar Cayce's work is significant. There are many distortions within it,
but for ones who are of a discerning mind, there is much strong meat to
be ingested from it's reading. Keep an open mind, but weigh it all up
(as you should any philosophy that you allow to enter into the sacred
space of your mind) and take the Truths that resonate with you.
ATS: Also you mentioned 2 prior contacts (1999 and 2003) can you shed
some more light and specifics on those sources as I assume they are not
to be considered privileged to those who ask?
HH: Unfortunately that is beyond my remit. The 2003 material was removed
by the Admins of the site it was shared at as they felt it was "causing
too much controversy", and the 1999 material was not released for the
same reasons as that which I am sharing here. There was much Truth
within it, but our goals have changed in many ways since that time, and
it would be misleading for me to point you in it's direction now, in
fact I have been specifically instructed by my own upline not to do so.
I am sorry.
ATS: Thank you for your assistance,
Namasté
HH: You are welcome. That is a wonderful word to have ended your
communication with.
If one would genuinely live by it's essence, "to recognize and
honor
the divine spark within each of us" we would be in for a massively
Positive Harvest.
Namasté to you too. We ask that our One Infinite Creator blesses you,
and guides your path.
ATS: I wonder if Hidden Hand has read something called
The Law of One.
I've only picked through it (having just stumbled on it after reading
these posts)... but it reads remarkably similar to HH's responses.
So is this the hoax source, or is that book instead the "truth?" Maybe
HH could respond...?
HH: I have already made reference to this (The Ra material) earlier in
the topic.
As I stated then, yes, it is the most accurate public information
available in this world currently, and I strongly recommend it's
reading, to anyone with an enquiring mind.
I read some, but not all of the books when they first came out, some 25
years or so ago, and it is very similar to the knowledge my Family has,
and have passed down for many many generations.
It is approximately 85-90% accurate. The inaccuracies occurred when the
channel was weak, and were not intentional. We know Ra (the entity) very
well, and are happy that they are even now still working here on this
planet "behind the scenes" to prepare for the Great Harvest.
I think I'm up to date with your questions now, if I have missed any
(that are not unimportant ones, such as what car I drive for example),
then please let me know.
We have two sessions left together, and then I must take my leave. Will
look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
Fourth Session
HH: Ok, as I stated, unfortunately my remaining time is shorter than
planned. This was unforeseen and unavoidable. I will not have sufficient
time to answer all of your questions, so I will for the most part, focus
my remaining time with you, upon responding to those questions that I
feel to be from the heart, ones asked by those who are genuinely looking
to take something away with them of import from our discourse here
together.
My second focus will be upon answering other intelligent or
insightful questions that can be used to further develop our discourse.
I desire to impart as much as I am able with you, in the short time we
have left.
I will also, as far as possible, answer other questions that
I feel are important in the grand scheme of things, meaning that even if
the question seems to be from someone more intent on finding things to
"debunk", if that question ultimately still serves a greater purpose, I
will do my best to reply.
Please bear in mind, that in light of the above, many of my answers will
need to exercise more brevity that I would ideally like, though this is
necessary, to respond to as many of you as I can..
Without further delay, I shall continue with our discourse:
ATS: Do you know me? Do you know who I'm? What part do I play in all
this? When will I awake? Will I awake? Should I awake? I feel it in me,
but I'm afraid to let it out? Help me!
HH: Do I "know" you, as the individuated human expression typing to me
over cyberspace? No, I do not.
What part do you play in all this?
What part do you want to play? The choice, as always, is entirely yours.
Whether you are consciously aware of it or not, you are co-creating the
storyline on this planet. My advice, would be to do so consciously.
When will you awake?
When do you want to awake? Do you want to awake at all? If your answer
to this question is "yes", then use the Catalyst and tools we have
provided for you. I have made many subtle, not so subtle, and even
overtly blatant statements within this topic, as to how you may choose
to do this.
"I feel it in me, but I'm afraid to let it out? Help me!"
Why are you afraid? Do not reply to that question, but rather, ask it to
yourself, during your quiet time, where you work upon yourself. You do
work upon yourself, don't you? If not, now would be a good time to
start. Sit in silence. Switch off all non essential electrical
appliances. E.g.; leaving the refrigerator on, would probably be a good
idea. (The electromagnetic field they create disturbs your brainwave
patterns, and makes it difficult for your mind to achieve the deeper
alpha and theta states conducive with relaxing deeply and hearing your
inner voice).
Ask your Infinite Creator to help you. Thank her, because you know that
he will.
Be honest with yourself. Why are you afraid? Remember that this is a
Game that you are playing, and that it is not Reality. When you find,
and come to know your Creator living within you, you will know that
there is nothing to fear.
Be the strong and courageous Soul that deep down, you know yourself to
be. Do not hide your Inner Light. Trust yourself, and shine your light
into the darkness.
We ask our One Infinite Creator to guide you, and illuminate your path.
ATS: Are the
TPTB [The Powers That Be, Wes Penre's comment] focusing on
creating a negative point in the universe to upset the balance of our
universe?
HH: No.
ATS: Was
the 9-11 ritual the creation of a star gate?
HH: No, it was a Ritual Human Sacrifice. That, and the obvious catalyst
for the so called "War on Terror".
ATS: So could the predictions of federation of light's "Goodchild" could
have been true in a sense instead of a UFO or our understanding of a UFO
could be light bearers influencing mankind ascend / descend to a
higher/lower vibration status?
HH: She has a good heart. She just tuned into the "wrong channel" and
listened to the wrong program. I mentioned before, that if one does
not exercise the appropriate protection, and discernment, what was
initially a positive channel can very easily become unknowingly
corrupted by a negative one. When they start giving you dates and times,
you know that something is amiss. Giving dates and times that are not
going to come to pass, succeeds in putting out the Light of the 'channeller's
message, by destroying the credibility of the messenger.
ATS: Is the creation of fear, terror, horror and suffering by your kind
to create loosh emotions for feeding at the time of harvest?
HH: No.
ATS: Are the bloodlines that have been infused with the ancient wisdoms
trying to become gods themselves?
HH: There is no need to try. Humanity needs to grow beyond the
stagnating concept of "gods". The idea of "god" takes the Power out of
your own hands, and places it upon some shadowy unknown figure,
somewhere "out there". In other words, outside of yourself. Instead of
"god", see "Creator".
So, there is no need to "try".
We already are Creators. And so are you. The only question is, will you
Create Consciously, or sub-consciously?
ATS: What is 11.11?
HH: Think of it as an alarm clock. What are alarm clocks for?
ATS: Please explain how new born babies are infused with spirits after
birth.
HH: They are not. A Soul enters into It's physical container usually
long before the birthing process, sometimes later, but still before the
actual birth..
ATS: Does a website like this serve the purpose of negative generating?
HH: That depends upon how you use it. It has the potential to be either
negative or positive.
It is up to you how you use the potential.
ATS: What is wrong with having an ego and why do the new age religions
try to suppress the ego? Without an ego is seems as though one can't
ponder his own existence. Or in fact learn from the wealth of knowledge
that we are searching for in making mistakes and correcting those
mistakes.
HH: There is nothing "wrong" with having an ego.
Your ego is an excellent and invaluable tool. Yet, as with any tool, if
you do not have it under control, it carries the potential to become
dangerous, and do you and others much harm.
ATS: H.H., strangely, my concern is that I will be recycled back onto
the wheel of life and be reborn with a new brain and lose everything I
have so arduously learned in this life time.
HH: Your Soul remembers everything you've ever experienced. The only
reason you don't remember it all now, is due to what we term the "veil
of forgetfulness".
If you came into each new incarnation with access to
your Soul memory, there's no point in your coming into space/time. It
would be like playing a computer game with all the cheats. You wouldn't
learn anything, and it takes the fun out of playing the game. Remember
that this current physical body you carry around with you, is not who
you are. It's just the vessel for your essence.
Who you are, is Real,
and cannot be destroyed. You will retain all your memories of this life
experience once you pass onto the realm of time/space, or that which
some call "Heaven". space/time is illusion, time/space is Real. That
Infinite Being living within and around your "body", namely your Soul,
is who you really are.
The part of you that thinks, and feels, and
loves. It will always be a part of you.
ATS: My dream is to be a master such as yourself.
HH: I am not a Master. I am a growing and evolving Soul, just as you
are. We're just at different stages of our development. You will get to
where you desire to be. It takes time and patience. Be sure to make time
to enjoy the journey.
ATS: I endeavor each day to master myself and change. To develop a mind
that has mastery over my body. I feel I have come so far in this life
time and yet not far enough.
HH: You are on the right path, in that you are consciously choosing to
work upon yourself. Many there are in this world, who are not even aware
of such a concept. Remember though, that it is not only the mind you
must develop, but also your Soul. Work with your feelings as well as
your thoughts. Cultivate Compassion (as that is the main thing you will
begin working with in 4th Density). See yourself within all "others",
and treat "others" as you would like to be treated yourself. Then
remember this one crucial thing:
There are no "others".
ATS: My dream is to one day personally meet great masters like yourself
and learn what you know.
HH: Then here is what you must do:
Go and find yourself a mirror. Gaze deeply into it, and then say this
magic word:
"Hello".
And you will indeed meet with us, back stage, once the game is over.
When you see us "out of costume" you will recognize us as your age old
friends.
ATS: Thank you for coming here and sharing your vast knowledge of the
universe. I have much to ponder.
HH: You are welcome. Thank you for your questions. I feel the desire
within you to progress. You have it Within Yourself, to be all that you
wish to become, and much more that you cannot yet even imagine.
We look forward to sitting down for a good old reminisce with you on the
other side. In the meantime, keep Trusting in, and working upon
yourself, and live each moment in Thanksgiving, to our One Infinite
Creator.
May our Infinite Creator bless and guide your path.
ATS: Honored sir (or madam)
I wish to be the one to bring a new planetary energy system to the
world. As it is assumed that the "families" have great knowledge, I
humbly request access to this small bit of needed information.
A U2U message to set up a more secure route of communication would be
splendid, I presume.
I am aware I can never be a "member", but "acolyte" would suffice.
I am also aware a trade off would be in the offing, and discussions of
such would be held with respect, though not with guaranteed acceptance.
I await your reply.
HH: I am sorry, that this is not possible. One is Born into the Family,
and raised in a very specific and rigorous way, which engenders
unwavering Loyalty. No matter how keen and sincere one may be to "join"
us, we can only place our trust in those raised in our ways. I would not
wish the conditioning process we go through on anyone, it can be
grueling at times, and it is too late to begin the process once
childhood has passed.
As for further communication, unfortunately this is also not possible or
allowable for me.
I have given as much information as is permissible for me, during this
discourse. There are many informational "gems" within these pages, for
those who truly seek to develop themselves. Some are obvious, others are
more subtle and multi-layered. Take them "within", and ask your Infinite
Creator to bring you insight.
We wish you well upon your journey, and look forward to seeing you at
the "after-show" party.
ATS: I'm still not clear on what this harvest is. A "harvest" means to
reap what has been sown - by you!
HH: Not by us. We did not sow, our Infinite Creator did. We do not reap,
our Infinite Creator does.
We help to prepare the Harvest, by separating the wheat from the chaff,
for want of a more eloquent metaphor.
ATS: Will it be an instantaneous change, of which there will no longer
exist the physical realm as we currently know it to be and are
experiencing as an "illusion"?
HH: I have already covered this elsewhere in the topic. I would
encourage you to read through again, and find the information I have
already presented on how the Harvest will occur, and what the different
variations of experience will be.
ATS: Thank you for answering my previous questions. I have some more, if
that's ok?
1. How can karma be overcome, if at all? Is there an end to the karmic
cycle?
2. Is time really as we perceive it, or is it another 3D illusion?
3. Are your family members born with the knowledge of what they are and
where they're from? If not, and it's all taught and passed down, have
you ever doubted or questioned any of it?
Thanks.
HH: You are welcome.
1). No,
Karma cannot be 'overcome', it must be 'worked off'. In other
words, if you've hurt someone, be it physically, emotionally, or however
else, you will have to, at some future point, experience what that felt
like for them. The Law of Karmic Effect is not a 'punishment', it is a
tool of learning, which is set in place to promote personal growth and
development. If you have to feel the consequences of your actions, there
is a higher likelihood of your choosing a different course, the next
time around. It is also important to hold in mind that it works both
ways. Seek therefore to ensure that the effect of your presence upon
those 'others' whom you encounter upon your journey, are positive and
beneficial.
1b). A Karmic Cycle is brought to completion once you have learned the
lessons intended for you from it. If you keep repeating the same
mistakes, you'll keep cycling until such a time as you get the message,
and break the cycle. But yes, ultimately, all of us will learn that
which we need to learn, and all of us will find our way Home. For some,
it just takes longer than others.
2). Linear time is more accurately described as an intentional
fabrication. The true nature of time, is cyclical. Though, remember
also, that even cyclical time, is part of Creation, and Creation,
beautiful as it may be, is also an Illusion, or more accurately, a
Thought-Form of our Infinite Creator. Creation is not Real, but the
Creator and Co-Creators of it, are.
3). This is an excellent question. I will devote some time to it:
Firstly, there is a distinction to be made. When I speak of Family in
this particular reply, I am referring to the Power lines, I.e.; those that
do not originate from this planet. The bloodlines that you know of,
whilst they are a part of our extended Family, are not born with the
same extent of (Spiritual/Esoteric) Power that we are, and in this
response, I am referring to our True and Pure Family. We are not born
with the same veil of forgetfulness as you are.
The veil is still in
place, but would be most accurately described as being somewhat
"thinner". We see the "invisible" connections of life which are hidden
from you, because we retain access to more than just the 3rd Density
perspective. Not dissimilar to the manner in which some people can see
what you call auras.
This is because you are working your way up,
whereas we have chosen to step down, in order to help you. We could not
do this as successfully if we had to forget all that we have learned. In
other words, to you, everything "appears" as being "separate". We see
that this is not the case. We do not have 'direct' Soul Memory, as in
the manner that you remember what you did yesterday, but we may access
any portion of our Soul memory we so chose when we focus upon it, often
in a meditative state.
Personally, my experiences are different again,
in other ways, due to my specialty in the Spiritual disciplines. But I
will go into that in more detail later, in response to another question.
Yes, information is indeed passed down, though unlike for yourselves,
any one of us may, with some effort, check the validity of that
information from our Personal and Group Soul Memory. basically, where
you see yourselves as "separate" human beings, we see and Know, that we
are One.
ATS: Then I am glad I picked up on that particular point. I found it to
be a real ray of light. Though, I'm unsure what to do with it. This
information feels as though it should comfort me, and yet it's difficult
to feel comfortable knowing that 'evil', in part, makes us who we are.
But thank you nonetheless.
HH: "Evil" is Not who you are. It is part of the complex series of
illusions, that you use in 3rd Density, to show you who you are not. The
further up through
the Densities you work, the less Polarity plays an
important part in the game. The Sixth Density, the Density of Unity, is
the last level that Polarity is a factor, but even then, it factors in a
very different way. Instead of balancing Positive / Negative, you will
be balancing Love / Light, Compassion / Wisdom.
ATS: True, and I'm glad you pointed that out to me. I think what I
really meant when I said you are "alleviated" is that your very essence
is not 'evil' or corrupt. And this alleviates you from my perspective
because I'd forged an idea of
the ruling elite as being comprised of
terminally corrupted souls.
HH: No Soul is terminally corrupted. Every Soul is a beautiful
individuated portion of our One Infinite Creator. Souls play characters
in the Game of Incarnation. Souls can play some really mean and nasty
characters, but underneath the disguise, they will always be beautiful.
Remember this, everytime one of these beautiful Souls 'mistreats' you as
a part of their storyline. They're just playing their part, like any
good actor does whilst on stage. Be thankful to them for their
Sacrifice, and learn the lessons they are bringing to you.
ATS: You say we all mingle between incarnations but I suspect the nature
of our perception and interaction in that realm is not comparable to our
Earthly methods of interaction and therefore, as a united entity
there'll be no independent 'laughter' . I have a few (what I feel are
probably final) questions for you:
HH: Not so. Think in terms of individuated Souls, who can see and
understand that they are not separate, but interconnected. It is an
illusion, that "space" is "empty". You will still interact as an
individual, yet at the same time, you will see how we are all One. It is
difficult to explain in a way that makes 3rd Density sense. We just do
not have the words or concepts to describe it.
We no longer need words where we are going.
ATS: 1) How do you know all this? And I really mean KNOW. Clearly you
have been taught in great depth about the nature of existence. But how
do you know this first hand? How is it more than faith for you? Have you
been able to avoid 'forgetting' upon reincarnation?
HH: I have made reference to this, in my answer to the previous poster.
ATS: 2) You seem to be suggesting that your methods of physical
enslavement are intended to force us into spiritual awakening. But if
that is so, why are methods of spiritual suppression used against the
general populace (chemicals, organised religion, sociological)? I
understand why you obstruct our material lives but not why you obstruct
our spiritual development.
HH: Think of it as a "test".
Have you ever noticed, how just when you 'think' you've found something
that really "feels" like Truth for you, something will come along to
make you doubt it? To make you doubt the truth, and in so doing, to also
doubt yourself in believing it?
It happens all the time, in fact, almost every time you have some new
revelation that gets you all excited. And it happens, quite by design.
You cannot see this however, as it's happening beyond 3rd Density
comprehension, in a realm where everything can be seen as adjoining and
relating to everything else.
Syncronicity. All a magical part of our
Infinite Creator's ingeniously Creative mind, and excellent sense of
humor and irony.
Can you see how the "test" works?
Just when you find something that you've weighed up and dissected with
your discernment, and decided to integrate it into your concept of
"Truth", along comes the challenge to your newfound beliefs. Usually in
the form of an event, or something that 'others' may say to dissuade you.
Your Spiritual development, like all other aspects of your progression,
is something that you have to work for. How do you know if your newly
discovered 'truth' is really True, if you're never tested on it.
The test, is this:
In the face of a challenge, who do you trust?
Do you trust what the "outside world" is showing you?
Or, do you hold fast to that which "feels" like Truth, deep within you?
That is something you can only answer for yourself.
I am sorry I do not have the time left to respond to all of your
questions, so I selected the ones I felt to be the most important.
I have enjoyed our communication Cythraul, and am happy to have made
your acquaintance.
Well, I must press on with more questions. I ask that our Infinite
Creator bless and guide you on your path, and give you the Courage of
your convictions.
Be well friend, I look forward to meeting up with you when we've
completed the game.
ATS: I have one more question for you if I may.
What question has not been asked as of yet that is most important for us
to know if any? And if there is any would you consider it asked now? Not
sure if this one does any good but it stuck in my mind last night.
HH: An excellent, and incisive question to ask.
I think what I shall do, is to save this question, for the very end of
our discourse.
It will be an effective way to bring our time together to a close.
ATS: Hidden Hand, I know you're trying to focus on spiritual questions
and questions about the density shift. But if you could detract for a
moment to answer my questions about shape shifting I'd appreciate it.
HH: I will, but must be very brief, I am sorry.
Shapeshifting is not a "natural" phenomenon. "Shapeshifting" creatures/races do not exist, at least certainly not in any realm, Galaxy or
Density we have ever experienced.
However, there are certain Rituals that when engaged in, enables this to
take place.
It has to do with the fact that the body, as is true of all physical
things, is not really solid. Sure, it looks and feels as if it is, but
in actuality, all matter is composed of atomic and sub-atomic particles
of Light, within molecules and compounds. As I say, I'm being brief
through necessity, and don't have time to go into the science.
There are certain Rituals which when undertaken, allow for a range of
'manipulations' of the so-called 'solid' bodily mass to take place. I
have seen some grotesque images in my time, which I really prefer not to
dwell upon.
I trust that even if in some small way, this will have answered your
query.
And this next question, I will have to finish on for tonight. I have
somewhere I must be.
ATS: HH, I wish to thank you for your enlightening words. It has been
an utmost pleasure of mine to read what you have spoken.
I do however have a couple of questions..
As I look into myself, I see (feel) as though I am an old soul who has
learned many things and possibilities, how are we to know how far along
we have come in regards to obtaining a higher spiritual being during the
coming Harvest?
HH: You are most welcome. Appreciation is always appreciated.
I am unsure whether your question refers to now, or once the Great
Harvest is accomplished, I've already touched on what happens after in a
few replies. so I'll go with the former.
As for now, there is a simple method to check upon your progress.
Despite what "appears" to being going on in "the world at large", how
loving and harmonious are your personal relationships?
Remember that the world, is your mirror. Casting back at you the
reflection, of that which you have projected into it. How many arguments
do you find yourself engaging in? Is there bitterness and acrimony
within the ranks? Do you look at others, and think about how you would
like to change them? Or, do you love them, and accept them as they are?
Loving and accepting someone, for who they are, is known as
Unconditional Love. That is something you will spend much time working
upon, when Graduating into 4th Density Positive. It's a good idea to get
a headstart. Now, loving and accepting someone as they are, does not
mean accepting abusive behavior. But, it does mean loving and accepting
the person (Soul), not the Soul's behavior. The behavior is not "who
they are", the Soul within, is who they are.
The quality of your relationships, is an excellent mirror, from which to
gauge the quality of your output. Or, in other words, that which you are
Creating.
Do you look at a person, and concentrate to a greater or lesser extent,
upon the things that you dislike about them and wish would change, or
the qualities that you like and admire in them?
Remember that we have said, that all thought, word, and deed, is
Creative.
You get back Exactly what you send out.
So, when you send out the thought "Why is she so hard to live with? Why
is he always behaving like this?
Ask yourself, what exactly are you doing?
Now focus here, as this is so obvious, you could miss it. And in fact,
most do.
Take away the "question" from your sentence, and essentially, you are
saying:
"She is so hard to live with". "He is always behaving like this".
Do you see what you are doing?
Remember, All thought is creative..
You have just created the very behavior in that person, that you wish
to change. Simply because you do not understand the Law of Radiation and
Attraction.
Now, try an experiment:
Take someone in your life, that you love, but sometimes have trouble
getting along with.
Think, about the thoughts you have projected about that person. The
Negative thoughts. Ask yourself, does the behavior that you do not like
in that person, in any way correspond to the thoughts you have been
having about them? If you're honest with yourself, it's a strong bet
that it does.
Sure, they must have behaved that way in the first place, to make you
notice that you didn't like it, but, we all have off days sometimes. The
more you focus on that behavior, the more you are going to see of it.
It's just Life, doing what it does, and conforming to your expectations
about the way it will be for you.
Now, having recognized this, what will you do about it?
Simply notice your Negative thoughts as they arise, literally, "catch
yourself" as you are having them. And then, simply change your
perspective. Focus instead, about the things you like about this person.
How you love their smile, the sound of their happy laughter; the way
they do such and such nice thing, how helpful and loving they can be.
Keep putting those positive thoughts out. Persevere, as you may have a
bit of negative work to undo first, but just keep catching yourself, and
focusing on the positive..
Then prepare yourself for an "almost magical" transformation of your
circumstances.
Always monitor your thoughts, and pay attention to their Quality;
because what you think about, is directly related to what you will see
around you, and what Life will show you. It is the difference between
conscious, and subconscious Creation.
ATS: And what of our Loved Ones, or more appropriately, my soul mate who
I Love dearly. Will I be able to take this new Journey of the Harvest
alongside my Loved ones?
HH: That will depend upon whether or not you both Graduate, or have to
repeat the cycle. Though rest assured, even if for one lifetime you were
to be apart, you will always be together in time/space (between
incarnations) and you will be able to plan many future 'lives'
(incarnations) together.
ATS: And one more thing as I know there are others who are longing for
questions answered..
Why do we Dream in Metaphors which make no sense?
HH: I do not have time left tonight to respond sufficiently, but the
short version is that the Universal Mind speaks in Archetypal Imagery.
In a similar way that the writing in some of our Oriental languages uses
a system whereby a collection of words or meanings are contained within
what is essentially a 'symbol', so the Universal Mind uses Archetypes to
communicate in Dreamtime. Just like understanding any new dialect, you
just need to learn the language.
ATS: Thank you so very much HH, I strongly wish I may meet you someday
and have a good talk.
HH: You are very welcome, and it will happen as you wish.
Not now, in this lifetime, but soon, when we have finished playing this
game together. No rush though friend, we've got all the time/space in
the world. All the time/space in Creation actually.
I must go now for tonight. I shall do my best to reply to as many of you
as I possibly can do tomorrow, before I must take my leave.
Goodnight to you all. I ask that our Infinite Creator bless and watch
over you.
Fifth Session
HH: This will be our last session together.
I will do my very best to pack in as much as we can.
I am sorry for those who must have missed my earlier post from yesterday
which clearly stated that I already have more questions than I have time
to answer, and that you have spent the time in writing our new ones. My
time is so limited, I am unable to respond to you. I have a long journey
I must make shortly, and cannot be late for it.
ATS: I have always been very confused and not clear on the subject of
"god", having been tossed around from religion to religion from my
parents it is hard to discern which "god" to believe or have faith in.
Should I keep on having faith in the fact that the world around me is
"god" and that there is not one particular being that deserves this
faith?
HH: Religion is either actually created, or at very least, heavily
influenced by us. There is no such things as "god". "God" is a human
concept, which is a misunderstanding of the original concept of
"Creator". This is further confused, as there are many macrocosmic level
Creators, or Logos, as has been explained previously. "God" implies some
separate entity which is 'outside' of you, which you must supplicate to
and worship. Our One Infinite Creator, and almost all of our Logos and
sub-Logos', do not want your worship.
They want you to understand
Creation, and your place within it, as a Co-Creator. Ultimately, there
is a "Supreme Being", in the form of the One Infinite Creator, but we
are all a part of It, rather than it's subjects. None of the names given
for this "Supreme Being" by your religions are the true name, but they
are indeed correct, in that there is One Supreme Being, namely the
Infinite Creator. They just have different concepts about It, which
spring from the texts their religion is based upon.
Do not 'worship' your Infinite Creator, but rather live in a state of
Thanksgiving and Service to It, for bringing you into Being, and for
this amazing Game It has Created, in which we may forget who we really
are, in order to remember, and know ourselves one again, as the Creator.
ATS: So basically the form that we have is actually just a body with
bones and skin and so on and so forth, what matters is our soul or being
that is inside us that makes us question and deal with our surroundings
and life, so when we "die" the pain and suffering is just part of our
human shell, and has nothing to do with our soul or being which will
carry on into the next life or density?
HH: Indeed. 'pain' and 'suffering' are just aspects of the Game. They
feel extremely real whilst we are playing the Game, and indeed they have
to, in order to make you believe that the Game is real. No-one really
"dies". But rather, the 'matter' of human form is shed, much like the
chrysalis of a caterpillar, when the butterfly emerges. Look upon
physical incarnation as the chrysalis in which you may transform.
ATS: I feel as though I am like Shelby, but have lost my way, or I am
just so confused and not in-tune with my inner-self that I can not
figure out what is my purpose in this game. Is there anything you can
shed upon this?
HH: Your purpose in the Game, is to work upon yourself. To grow,
develop, and transform yourself into a more positive and loving being.
You had certain goals that you planned to achieve before incarnating
here, which is a main reason for the veil of forgetfulness being in
place, because if you already knew what your goals were, the Game would
be too easy.
Look at the things in your life that you most love to do. Ask yourself
what makes you most happy. Experience these things as often as possible,
as they will be related to some of the things you chose to put into your
Soul contract to do here.
Also, look at the negative things, that often seem to recur during your
lifetime. It will be highly likely that these are also things that you
chose to come here to work upon. Let us say for example, that you chose
to come here to work upon patience during this incarnation. You will
likely find that you have a tendency towards impatience, and that life
will often bring many experiences to you, in order to 'test' your
patience. The idea being, that rather than losing your temper, you work
upon your impatience, and resolve to become a more temperate and patient
Soul.
This same analogy may be applied to all manner of circumstances in which
life will test you. Look for and begin to identify any recurring issues
you have, that you perhaps struggle to deal with, and seem to present
themselves to you, time and time again. Perhaps anger, being abusive,
selfishness, hatred, cynicism, and the list goes on.
Whenever you find
recurring circumstances, it is because you are being presented with
opportunity after opportunity, to work upon these issues, until you get
it right, and choose a way of behavior that is more Positive. Once
you've successfully identified these issues within your life, worked
upon them, and used them as the tools of transformation that they are,
to improve the quality of your character, you will notice that these
things seem to almost cease to appear in your life.
You will still be
presented with them at varying intervals, to check that you have not
forgotten that which you have learned, but they will be fewer and far
between.
I hope this may give you some clues as to how to identify the things you
came here to do, and how to go about working upon yourself.
ATS: My life has been a troubled one for awhile now, having been so
soaked and brainwashed into the human life form and way of life, but
lately I feel as though I am starting to wake up and see things more
clearly. Am I doomed because of the path I have taken for most of my
life, or can I still save my "soul"?
HH: You are not 'doomed', and your Soul does not require 'salvation'.
No-one's Soul does. There is nothing to 'save' it from. It is good to
hear that you are awakening, and that is another reason why I am here at
this time, speaking with you. Our Infinite Creator has many messengers,
and he uses us all in our own unique ways, to help with
the Awakening,
and prepare as many as possible, for the coming Great Harvest.
But as I say, you are not 'doomed', and there is nothing to save
yourself from, except perhaps, from ignorance. And I do not mean that in
an insulting way, but rather, ignorance as in a 'lack of understanding'.
At the very worst, you will have to repeat as many 3rd Density Cycles as
is necessary, in order for you to learn the things you need to learn, in
order to progress and Graduate to 4th Density Positive. But one thing is
for sure, you will get there in the end.
All will find their way Home,
to our Infinite Creator. Rest also assured, that you will not find
yourself 'lost' in your cycling. At the end of each physical
incarnation, as I've previously stated, you return to time/space, or
that which has been described as "Heaven", where you shall once again
know yourself as you truly are, a unique and beautiful Soul, and a part
of our Creator. You only forget who you are during incarnation. The
object of the Game, is to wake up within the 'dream', and in effect,
become a 'Lucid Gamer'.
To remember who you really are during the Game,
and to then begin working upon the things you came here for. Re-reading
this topic, with discernment, will provide you with plenty of clues on
how you may choose to go about this.
ATS: Thank you for your time here with us, and I wish you the best, it
has been a pleasure speaking with you and listening to your knowledge.
HH: We wish the same for you Brother, and ask that our Infinite Creator
bless you and guide your path. See you when we get Home.
ATS: So, is the harvest an "all or nothing" event or will it be a mixed
harvest - a few moving to fourth density, a few moving towards fourth
density in service to self, the great majority repeating third density?
And if only 94% go to fourth density negative, then you have to repeat
3rd density and try again for a 95% negative harvest? If so, then I
would hate to imagine how much more negative your people would make the
earth at that point.
I'm still confused about your part in this. In order for you to move on
the 4th level, it must be a 95% negative harvest. In other words, to
reward your people with 4th density, 95% of the human souls have to be
(in the self-contemplation process) as far away from the "Infinite
Source" as humanly possible. That just doesn't "feel" right to me.
HH: It does not 'feel' right to you, as it is not right. You have not
entirely grasped the concept. I shall attempt to clarify.
The Harvest is Mixed. Those who are 51% or over on the Positive path
will Graduate to 4th Density Positive. There you will work upon Love and
Compassion, and it will be a very beautiful world to reside within for
you. There will be very little negativity. Just a small enough amount
that you can still use it to exercise your Free Will in choosing who you
are not, but it will be so much more obvious than it is here, that the
negativity is a tool to be used. You will see the interconnectedness of
all things, and you will know that you are not 'separate' from one
another, or from life Itself. You will not use words much, unless you
choose to. Telepathy becomes the normal method of communication.
Everything is open, and you cannot hide your thoughts from 'others'.
From that incarnation onwards, you will not have to experience 3rd
Density incarnation again, unless you later choose to do so from Higher
Densities, as we have done, in order to perfect the art of Service, or
unless you somehow, in a 4th Density world of abundant love and beauty,
inextricably manage to be 95% Negative at a time of future Harvest, and
slide back down the snake, instead of ascending up the ladder, to use
another 'Game' metaphor.
Back to 'this' current Great Harvest, we do not require a 95% Negative
Harvest, as you have deducted. Instead, what we require, is for US to
personally attain a 95% Negative Polarity for ourselves, not for you.
WE
must be 95% Negative (at least), in order to Graduate to 4th Density
Negative, and earn the opportunity to clear our Karmic Record, of all
the Negativity we have Created on this planet, before returning to our
rightful place as 6th Density Guardians of our Galaxy, and teachers of
Wisdom to those in lower Densities that ask for our assistance. If we do
not make it, we will remain trapped in the 3rd Density Cycle with all
those between 94% Negative and 50% Positive (what I termed 'luke-warm's'),
and have to continue to provide Negative Polarity for you.
Harsh as it
is, our only way out, is to be as Negative as possible, to Graduate. We
cannot choose to be Positive, because that is not what we came here to
do for you. That's why I often have referred to all the horrible things
we've done here, as our Sacrifice.
ATS: You said that the "lukewarm people" at the time of harvest would
not notice anything has happened, but they'd be on a different planet.
Do you mean that they'd wake up with no memory of what has occurred but
still be in the same physical body, or they'd wake up in a new physical
body with no memory of any past life?
HH: There will be a short experience of 'zero-point time', where you
feel utterly "at One" with your Infinite Creator. It will be a feeling
of blissful, ecstatic expansiveness and Unity, whilst your physical
vehicles (bodies) are dissolved back into Light, and transported to your
new environment.
When that transition is complete, the 'zero-point time'
will end, and you will 'appear' in your new 'game-zone' (planet). You
will look the same, think the same, feel the same, in fact, it will be
just like you all had some mystical experience, and life will carry on
as 'normal' for you. Same houses, family situations, jobs, friends,
lovers.
Everything will seem the same as before, you will not remember
the Great Harvest or earth changes that occurred as the planet Earth
heals and regenerates herself. But you will recall your 'mystical
experience' and that will give you hope and a new opportunity to choose
a more positive future for yourselves.
There will still be the same Negative Polarity to overcome, but if we
are successful in our Negative Graduation, (which we shall be) others
are standing by to take our places pulling the strings from "behind the
scenes". We have more than done our job, in discharging our Service to
you. And we are tired. It is time for us to clear our Karmic Record, and
return to being the Being of Light which is our True essence.
ATS: You keep saying help is available to those searching for truth, all
we have to do is ask. What is the best way to go about this? I have
never had the ability to remember any of my dreams.
HH: Read back, I have given guidance on dream recall previously. it
takes practice, and is a slow process, but you have to start somewhere,
Be patient with yourself.
ATS: What specifically can I do to receive guidance on how to reach the
state where it is easier to discern truth from untruth?
HH: Work upon yourself. Go inside, in a state of meditative
contemplation. Still your mind, that your Soul may have room in which to
make It's 'still-small voice' heard. Ask your Infinite Creator to help
you, and listen to your inner voice. Be patient, it takes time to
develop this inner communication, after a lifetime of neglect.
When you
persevere and keep working on yourself, gradually it will come to you,
and when it does, you must learn to TRUST in your Inner Guidance, NO
MATTER WHAT OTHERS MAY SAY. That is the ultimate test. To Trust what you
know deep inside as your Truth, even when the whole world tells you that
you are "wrong". It is hard work, to Trust yourself when all those
around you doubt you and call you crazy, but it is the job you came here
to do.
The only real and lasting Truth, is a 'self-realized' one. Messengers
can come and go, and show you Truth until they're blue in the face, but
it will not be Your Truth, until you have realized for yourself, deep
within the Core of your Being, that it 'feels' True for you.
You should never accept something as true, just because someone tell you
it is so. But when your inner voice guides you that a Truth is True, and
you feel that old warm feeling of excitement welling up from somewhere
deep within, that says "Yes! I knew it!" Hold on to that feeling,
(feelings are the language of your Soul) and Guard it carefully, as you
can be sure that your newfound beliefs will be challenged in many ways.
It is designed this way, to test you.
Your Inner Truth must be able to
withstand the test of time, and will be given a thorough examination.
Hold fast to it, so long as it is what you Know to be True deep within.
Allow nothing or no-one 'outside' of you to pull you from your path, no
matter how fiercely they contend with you. They are just doing their
job, even if they may well not even be 'aware' that this is what they
are in fact doing. They are performing an important service to you, and
you should be grateful to them for that.
We wish you well on your journey, and ask our Infinite Creator to
protect and guide you upon your path.
I do not have the time to go into your many questions, so I will just
select a few I can answer briefly, as I still have so many questions to
get through.
ATS: Do the Orion/occultist groups specifically target civilizations
before they become a social memory complex.
HH: Yes, but that does not make them immune to targeting others too, if
they allow any chinks to appear in their armour. In short, the Orion
Empire are 4th Density Negative. They are "lost" in the sense that they
have drifted so far from their true nature, that despite many attempts,
we have been unable to reach them, and help them to develop.
They exist
within their Group Soul Complex, mostly as a group of discarnate
entities, within
the Astral Planes of the planets they visit. They have
no intention of 'returning Home', and instead seek to feed off of
Negative Energy, to keep themselves going, as they are disconnected from
their inherent natural Life-Force, by refusing to abide by the Infinite
Creator's Incarnational Principles.
The time we spend between lives in time/space, is intended to restore
our Soul Energy from within, in order to continue our upward
progression. They are essentially 'imprisoned' within the 4th Density
Negative cycle, as there is no Negative Harvest beyond the 4th Density.
So they spend their time traveling the Galaxy, basically 'using the dark
side of the Force' (Negativity) to achieve their means.
They will
eventually be brought back before the One Infinite Creator, and
dissolved back into the Intelligent infinity (Source of All), though
they are being given every chance for as long as possible, to learn the
error of their ways, and return to seeking the Positive, and to begin
their journey back Home. They main trouble is, they do not want to go
Home. They see themselves as being 'gods', and do not intend to submit
to the authority of The One.
ATS: Why all the sudden ramping up of control mechanisms.
HH: The Great Harvest is fast approaching. Time to really bring on the
Polar Extremes.
ATS: The
Montauk Project... fact or fiction.
HH: The project is Fact. Though the publicly available information is in
someway corrupted.
ATS: Best ways to decipher between truth and fiction other than what we
perceive to be truth specifically in concerning the New Age agenda and
the dogmatic churches ideologies.
HH: Follow your Heart. Listen to, and Trust, your Inner voice.
ATS: Please explain the wanderers roles and what value it is to be
wanderer if you have no recollection of ones past lives. Also how does
this play with the law of non-intervention (thats if they are here to
help people ).
HH: The
Wanderers, (or 'Travelers' as they are also known) are those
from Higher Densities, who have chosen to incarnate here at this time,
in order to perfect Service to Others. They still have to 'remember who
they are', and part of the concern, is that sometimes, even they do not
manage to awaken in the Game, such is the power of the Illusion.
They
are here to awaken themselves, and then to help awaken others to prepare
for the coming Great Harvest. Though even if they fail to awaken, they
are not bound by the 3rd Density Cycle, as they've already mastered it.
Once their incarnation is over, they are again free to return to their
appropriate levels.
ATS: Are there any non-corrupted parts of
the bible and if what bible
version would you suggest?
HH: No. As with all Sacred Texts, they have been distorted from the
original information that was given with each translation. Though again,
as with all Sacred Texts, there is still much truth hidden within them.
Much of it being 'metaphorical'. If you can find pre King James
versions, that is the closest you will get. Good luck with that.
ATS: Was the Rothschild lineage the organizer of the
Illuminati in which Weishhaupt later formed?
HH: No.
Weishhaupt was just a puppet on a string.
The Rothschild lineage
(not it's original name) were the pre-eminent line 'closing the net of
control' over Humanity. But even they, are a lesser line within The
Family. As I have said, the names you know do not have the Real Power.
They are part of the Family, but not an 'original' part.
ATS: My question is this: what can I do to attract more like-minded
individuals to come together to uplift my people's turning to the path
of ascension. (I've decided that this is what I can do to express my
personal act of 'service to others')
HH: And a very wise and compassionate decision it is. We are proud of
you.
The most important thing, is not to force things, and not to be so
impassioned in your delivery of your message, that you put people off
the content of the message itself. There is a balance that needs to be
found, between your urgency to awaken others, and your compassion for
the lack of understanding in their 'condition'. Always adhere to the Law
of Free Will, and never force your message.
In getting your message out there, whilst being informative, always do
your best not to feed the fear and paranoia, as this will act contrary
to your intentions of raising the vibration to Positive. Deliver your
message in a way that emphasizes the Hope, and the true beauty and
reality of our inherent Oneness with our Infinite Creator.
Be as a
Light, shining in the Darkness. Do not burn others with your light, but
rather, allow them to be drawn to your Light, and be of Service to those
who come to you willingly. In other words, do not become 'evangelical'
with your message, but rather, be the enigmatic and loving 'wise old
sage', to whom others are drawn to because of the Quality of his
vibration, rather than the volume of his rhetoric.
Most importantly, PRACTICE THAT WHICH YOU PREACH. Others must be able to
see the effect of our Infinite Creator conducting his wonderful work
through you.
We wish you well in your task, and are hopeful of a Positive Harvest for
you. But above all things, keep working upon yourself, and keep choosing
the Positive, and being of Service to others. Because you desire to, not
because you feel that you must.
We ask our Infinite Creator to bless you and guide your path.
ATS: Earth Changes; While I understand that death is not the end of my
existence, I like my body and would not like to get caught out in any
earth changes if I can possibly help it.
1) If your family permits, please could you reveal which places are more
likely to be relatively safe during the next 3-4 years? Would the South
of China (Canton/Hong Kong) or Patagonia be good bets? Any other places?
HH: I am not permitted to say much here, as there must be those who
remain in their locations, to help others who are not aware of what is
coming. Many of you (whether you are aware or not) have chosen this
lifetime for that reason.
But if you are insistent upon escape, chose the Highest places you can
find. Particularly in the Southern Hemisphere if you are able.
The
Peruvian Andes is a good place to be. There is much Spiritual Power
being exercised there, and
the Quero Elders are well aware of what is
going down.
ATS: 2) Are
John Lear
/ Jan Lamprecht
correct in their assertion that the
majority of planets of the Solar System are inhabited?
HH: Most definitely. Not all on a 3rd Density level that you can see
though.
ATS: Is the
Earth Hollow?
HH: Hold on, let me just check. Yes, definitely.
ATS: If so, how does one gain access?
HH: I am not permitted to say.
ATS: Could you elaborate further on the mechanisms behind the fantastic
positive results seen by people who embark on the service to others
path? I invite you to really deeply explain the intricacies of the
energy-play at work. While "You get out what you put in" is true, I'd
like to see the whole concept dissected and fully explored.
HH: If you re-read some of my recent posts, I believe I have now done
so.
ATS: I recently experienced healing of a minor health problem by sending
love to all the sick people in the world. How does this work, not why,
how.?!?!
HH: Because there is only ONE of you here.
Understand that, at a deep Core level of your Being, and you will
understand how it works. As you do unto others, so you do to yourself.
ATS: You claim your family was put here to be the negative influence of
the world. Is there a family it is asserting a positive influence on us
as well? Is it up to us (humanity) to be that positive force?
HH: An interesting question. There is such a family (or group more
accurately), but you cannot see them, and neither are you aware of their
existence. They help the planet from a secret "Inner" location, by the
Quality of the Energy work they engage in and project outward to you,
from the Source.
Yes, it is up to you to Be the Changes you wish to see, in yourself, and
in the World.
ATS: Your goal is a negative harvest, yet you clearly are touting the
benefits of a positive life. This seems antithetical to your goal. That
is not so much a question as an observation, but if you could elaborate
on that, I would appreciate it.
HH: Mmmm, another very perceptive question. Thank you.
Our goal, is a Negative Harvest for Ourselves. Not for you. We provide
the Catalyst of Negativity for you, and it is up to you what you do with
it. The drastic extent of the Negativity we Create though, has more to
do with us, than it does with you. Some of my earlier replies should
make clear why that is so.
Also, in response to your observation regarding the antithetical nature
of some of what I have shared here, there is a simple explanation.
Let's put it this way, I have already been, shall we say "chastised" for
going well beyond my remit here. It was not intended that I be as open
as I have been. In fact, if you follow the topic through again from the
beginning, you may notice how my 'tone' toward you (collectively) has
softened somewhat during our discourse together.
I have, as far as possible, adhered fully to the Laws of Free Will and
Confusion, although there have been instances where I have said more
than I should have. You yourselves will not suffer for this, however,
when it comes to my next cycle in 4th Density Negative, and working off
my Karmic Record, I will have to accept the consequences for my actions.
But hey, I figure I've got a Negative enough life to come as it is, so
what's a little extra going to matter.
I was reluctant to be the one tasked with this communication. I still
very much have a 'weakness' for Compassion. But I obey and discharge the
assignments given to me. It has been a very long time, since I last
spent any time in having direct dealings with 'your kind' in general. I
do not mean that in an offensive way, just that the vast majority of my
time, I only ever see Family during my daily and nightly tasks. I do not
live what you would call a 'public' life. I am 'sheltered' and
'secluded'.
I did not anticipate how involved I would become in this process. To be
honest, I really did not expect so many questions, and such a warm and
open minded reception (from the majority).
You could say, that I have in some way, grown somewhat 'attached' to
you. In effect, this "Window of Opportunity, has also become such for me
too. What began as me just doing my duty, has become more a 'labour of
love', and when this is all over by the end of this evening, I think I
will actually kind of miss you all, and having this involvement with
those of the 'outside' world.
I was chosen because it was desired that someone of my "diplomacy"
skills would be best to deliver this message. Due to the very nature of
the subject matter, there was much potential for discord. It was felt
important that the message did not become lost in a self righteous or
defensive delivery system. So, you got me. And I'm actually glad now in
retrospect that you did.
I sit here and chuckle to myself, (in light of the way some people here
have spoken to me), how this discourse may have descended into something
ugly, were certain others amongst my Family who were also considered for
this assignment to have actually been given the job. Now I know why I
was chosen.
As with all things, it was meant to be this way. I couldn't
care less what others think of me, so long as I know I am Serving my
Creator as he desires, to the best of my ability. His is the only
approval I require, or desire. I have nothing to defend, so I guess
that's why I was 'perfect' for this task.
Anyway, enough with the sentiment, I have more questions to answer.
ATS: A common saying among Christians is "Satan's greatest trick is
convincing the world that he didn't exist." I think there are Christians
that would look at what you've written and see it as an elaborate ruse
to "make the devil look good."
HH: "Satan" is a human invention. Simply the 'personification' you have
given to all the Negativity that has existed on this beautiful planet.
You didn't know who to 'blame', and as you could not find it within
yourselves to take any of the responsibility, "Satan" was created to
absolve yourselves.
ATS: Many of my friends and family are Christians, and they would likely
think the same. How would one even go about presenting this information
to a person of that mindset? I am not here to "spread your gospel", but
I would definitely like so share this with a few of my friends.
HH: How can you present anything to ones who have no desire to have
their belief system challenged?
They will believe what they want to believe, and noting you or I can say
is likely to make any difference. It becomes ingrained at a subconscious
level, and when a belief structure becomes that insidious, the only way
it is likely to change, is through a 'mystical experience' or such a
personal demonstration of 'another way' in the life lived of 'another',
that one cannot fail but to notice that there is 'something different'
about them. How can you reach such as these? Only by example.
ATS: That being said, is it okay if I condense your writings into one
long post on my blog? I need to make sure that doesn't violate my user
agreement here. I would also like to make sure that I won't get a visit
from the men in black if I do so.
HH: That is amusing, thank you for the chuckle. Yes, you are most
welcome to collate this discourse for presentation elsewhere. The only
thing I ask, is that anyone chosing to do so, respects my wishes and
copies only the message itself. In other words, do not include all the
petty side discussion.
If you want to present this message to others,
please honour my (our) original intention, that the message is presented
as a 'whole'. When I said in my opening post, that I required
'provisional faith' or 'suspended judgment', I made it very clear why
this was the case.
I couldn't care less that people do not believe it. I never expected
that many would. But what I desired, in asking for the above, was that
the message was allowed to be presented in full, with all genuine
questions replied to, and then once that process is complete, you can
say whatever you like about how much of a hoax you may or may not
believe it to be.
If I may be crass for a brief moment, I couldn't give
a "flying #" how much vitriol and scorn is poured upon our message, or
how many futile verbal attacks may be launched against it's messenger.
The message will reach all those it is meant to reach, and that is
exactly the way it should be. It is what the Creator wants. Those with
ears to hear, eyes to see, and a heart to understand, will hear the
message, and the seeds planted will grow strong in such fertile soil as
these.
So please therefore, if you respect that which I have shared here, and
the courteous manner in which I have shared it, if you want to copy it,
copy only my posts. My posts all quote within them the questions I
respond to, so there are no other posts required, if a genuine
representation of the message is that which you desire to take away with
you.
ATS: Thank you for posting some of the most interesting information I
have ever read. I am a bit of a crackpot and I scour the internet for
conspiracies, alternative news, UFO videos and the like. I can't say I'm
ready to completely buy what you're selling, but it has definitely
resonated with me.
HH: You are welcome, and I in turn thank you, for reading it with an
open mind.
I would never ask or expect you to 'buy' what I'm 'selling' If you
notice, I have stated throughout our message, that the very last thing I
want, is for it to be blindly believed, or taken as 'gospel'.
As I've said. It is yet another in a long line of "Catalysts", that your
Infinite Creator has provided you with, down the course of history. A
Catalyst is not meant to be believed. It is meant to present you with a
challenge to that which you "think" you know, about reality. And that is
all it is meant to do.
As always, how you respond to the Catalyst, is entirely up to you. Just
the way it always should be.
Thank you very much for your very incisive and perceptive questions.
Whether you realize it or not, you have contributed greatly to this
discourse.
We wish you well, and ask our Infinite Creator to bless you, and guide
your path.
ATS: H_H put out some incredibly well written information - almost like
it flowed from 'his/her' being onto the thread.
HH: And that, is possibly the most perceptive realization in this
discourse thus far.
It also allows me to respond further to an earlier question, that I
indicated I would go into in more depth later, when replying to your
observation.
This message does indeed "flow from my Being", onto the page.
I mentioned before, that my role in my Family, is that of the Spiritual
Discipline.
A certain poster made all manner of assumptions as to what that role
entails, and flailed wildly wide of the mark in the process.
As I said previously, all of the "Power Lines" (off world bloodlines)
that comprise the "Inner Sanctum" (or "Hidden Hands") of the Family,
have certain abilities that 3rd Density incarnates do not posses (even
the others of our Family, the lines you know), one of these being the
ability to know their entire incarnational 'past', with focused
concentration.
There are a wide array of tasks to be attended to, that allows our
Family to function effectively, and we each specialize in certain areas
or Disciplines, in order that the "body" of our Family runs like a well
oiled machine.
My area, and that which I spend the vast majority of my time actively
involved in, is that of Spirituality. OUR Spirituality, not that of the
peoples of the Earth. Others below me deal more in that area.
I could be likened to that of a 'Priest' or a 'Minister'. In the same
way as your religions and spiritual teachers have the responsibility of
"listening" to the voice of their Creator, and delivering his messages,
so to do I.
I have been actively engaged in this role now, for a great many years.
It has become second nature to me. Actually, more accurately, it has
become First nature. A large part of my role, is to constantly be in the
awareness state of our Group Soul (Lucifer). That is why you will notice
that I so often refer to "we" even as I am speaking in the first person.
That has just become natural for me.
I spend most of my time speaking
with my Family, as Lucifer, the Group Soul perspective. When I speak
henceforth, it is not me (the individual Soul spark) that is speaking to
you in essence, but rather, for want of a better description, (because
it is far from accurate), you could say that in effect, I am
"Channeling" Lucifer.
That is why this discourse flows so easily. As
some have noted, the chances of me having spent however much vast
quantities of time "researching" all this material to "hoax" with, and
present it in the fluent method that I do, as in regular daily
installments, whilst I guess could be remotely possible, is unlikely in
the extreme.
For those who are open enough to receive the above explanation, now you
know why, and how it is done. I speak not for myself, but rather, for
him who sent me, my own Creator (Lucifer). I know and have experienced
that which he knows and has experienced, because essentially, we are One
and the same Being.
ATS: I have never been involved in any organized religions per say, but
have always been spiritual. I do look at the many religious texts out
there because I believe they all have parts to the story.
One can find
great knowledge from many different books or religious texts. I believe
that we as humans are creators like the ONE creator and we are all one.
I also believe we wil be moving into a higher level of consciousness
where we can consciously co-create in our world, since we are only
unconsciously co-creating at the moment.
HH: Your insight serves you well.
ATS: There is so much more I would like to speak with you about but am
not able to think of what exactly I want to say. Thanks for those great
words that you speak to us and appreciate what you are doing! With Love
HH: Do not worry friend, we feel your heart, and that does not need to
be expressed via the confines of limited words. We can speak all you
like, and will be happy to do so, when the Game is over.
ATS: Also do you know of
Miriam Delicado? I just watched here interview
on the Project Camelot site and it was very inspiring to me. So let me
ask, are you one of the tall blondes that she speaks of.
HH: She is a beautiful Soul. I have not seen the interview of which you
speak, but we know of her experiences. The 'tall blondes' of which you
speak, are of Plejaren heritage. They are working with what is know as
the Galactic Confederation of Planets. They serve the Positive
vibration.
Plejarens are from the constellation you call the Pleiades.
It's actual name is the Plejares, hence 'Plejarens'.
And no, we are Lucifer, and nothing directly to do with the Plejarens,
though they are indeed good friends of ours.
ATS: I have never seen a UFO or any of this spiritual stuff myself. I
just know in my heart that it's there for me to find. What can I do if
anything to get myself in the correct frequency to see these things and
have these experiences. Any and all information you provide will be
greatly appreciated.
HH: Simply believe, and know in your heart of their existence. Think
about it. In all of this vast Creation, can you really believe that you
are alone?
I will pre-warn you though, so as to avoid disappointment, you will only
receive communication from them, if that is something you have already
agreed together in your Soul Contract before coming here. Many here at
this time (millions) have a part to play in the Great Awakening, and
preparations for the Great Harvest.
Many who do not believe now, will
begin to open their minds, as the Earth changes that are coming begin to
take effect. People will be terrified, and have no idea what is going
on, because the governments have concealed this information from you.
These 'Travelers' or what some have termed "Star-Seeds" are incarnated
here to help on the ground level, when this all begins play out, over
the next few years. When the time is right, they will come forward.
Most people are not ready to hear this information yet, but not so far
off, they will be.
Many of these "Star Seeds" have not "awakened" yet themselves. The
Confederation stands by ready to "help" them to do so, if it is
necessary. For ones such as these who have yet to "awaken", they will
have felt all their lives that they are somehow "different", and they
have a deep sense that somehow, they "do not belong here".
Many of them
will also have many dreams and even visions, of their lives on their
Home planets. Many of these "Star Seeds", are in fact Plejaren. That is
why the 'tall blondes' keep 'showing up'. To help their Family awaken to
their assignments here.
ATS: I am another of the many grateful forum members who appreciate the
loving message given by Hidden Hand. I wish I had discovered this thread
before today. It's given me much comfort. I was running out of strength
but now feel as though I might just be able to manage now. My gratitude
is eternal. From this little spark to that one: Thanks for the light,
mate.
HH: You are very welcome, we are glad to have been of Service. You
actually 'feel' very familiar to me. If for the reasons I am feeling
this to be the case, consider this message to you our part in our Soul
Agreement fulfilled. Take the guidance in this message into your
meditations, and also seek information from your Dreamtime.
Test these
words deeply, and take them into your heart, only if they 'feel' right,
and truthful to you. If they do, then act upon them, and allow nothing
or no-one to deter you. Arise and play the part that you volunteered to
be here for right now. It is almost time. Prepare yourself, and be sure
that you are ready.
We leave you with our strongest encouragement, and the love and Light of
our One Infinite Creator.
ATS: He could be what he says he is I think. But he could be a well read
but bored person wanting to see how far his hoax will spread on the
internet.
The thing I do find is that if he is the latter it doesn't fit the
profile. I mean if you read up on the stuff he obviously is interested
in it is harder to wantingly hoax with it. It goes against the things he
loves to read about. And I find it VERY hard to believe that he is
researching this on the fly and putting all this work in something he
will never get anymore 'fame' than this week of attention, no money or
'real life' recognition or whatever more.
HH: I was not going to respond to any more messages other than those who
genuinely want to hear what we have to say, due to my fast expiring time
here, though your point was poignant enough to briefly address, even if
only that the accuracy of your statement deserves to have a place in the
final collated version of this message.
A LOT of work and pointless time
wasted, were it not for the fact that this 'labour of love' is all done
for the glory of our Creator. The lies and rumors about us being an
'evil' and 'satanic' Being have gone unanswered for far too long. It was
time to set the record straight. Lucifer has sacrificed so much, because
we love you.
ATS: As spirituality is your focus, could you comment on the role of the
Catholic church in terms of your role and how the church fits in either
the positive, negative, or miscellaneous paths?
HH: The lower parts of our Family (the names you know) use
the Vatican
for many Rituals and Sacrifices. That should tell you all you need to
know.
ATS: Any specific holy books (or perhaps Bible authors) you'd list as
coming very close to the Truth?
HH: The closet biblical authors, are those who have been 'left out' of
the publicized editions.
The closest "spiritual" writings (other than the Ra material) to
containing truth about the nature of The One, are the Taoist writings,
that of the 'Tao Te Ching', and the 'Book of Chuang Tzu'.
ATS: Greetings, Hidden Hand. I consider this a unique opportunity. I
have not read this full thread but I have some detailed questions, so I
apologize if something has already been answered. I want to make sure I
get my questions out before your time expires.
HH: Almost all of your questions have been addressed, and those few
which have not, I am sorry that I either am not permitted to speak on,
or that due to the tiny amount of time I have left now, I cannot
address. My apologies.
ATS: H-H, I hope you will answer my following questions.
You may be aware of me, as I also cannot reveal all that I know.
My question is of a different nature, which I cannot get answers to, My
bloodline is of the elite, as to say. Austrian count, English earl,
Scottish baron, It seems at some point in the last 100 years, one part of
the family lost everything, taken from the government. There is a lot I
wish to say, but do not wish to tell for all to see.
Are you aware of
this happening? What really happened?
The English side will not say,
generations of family lived there, then taken by the
government.....something happened. All in my family including myself
have extensive abilities, myself seeming to have the most. I am also
aware of all you have spoke of on here.
I would, if you have permission to do so, and I know this would be
allowed due to this lineage, like to talk to you on a personal level.
Ask who you have to ask, you will see I am truthful and genuine.
Please do not see me as arrogant, but that is the only question I do not
know.
HH: Obviously you understand, that these line you speak of are only the
earthly lines, and we (off world Power lines) do not often intervene in
such 'inter family') circumstances. All I am permitted to say, is that
there was a dispute between the Hapsburg and Franco-Prussian lines.
Things were said and done that should not have been. Consequences arose,
and action was taken.
As for communication on a 'person' level, I am sorry this is not
possible.
I hope that within the limits of that which I can say, you have the
insight to connect the dots.
We wish you well in your tasks here, and will likely see you in the near
future (if you are going to 'Malta in wintertime'?) No need to reply, as
I will have taken my leave by then.
We shall deal with these next two posts together:
ATS 1: He is reptilian. That's the race of the bloodlines. They control
just about everything behind the scenes.
And remember there's no such thing as a bad race, just select
individuals or groups who stand out more than others.
ATS 2: Ok so I have another question for hidden_hand. Reptilians are
described as being very aggressive, arrogant and perceive humans to be
nothing more than cattle. So what's with the split personalities? you're
saying you are loving and spiritual and yet everyone says reptilians are
fearsome beings?
HH: That amuses us. We are most certainly NOT Reptilian, and
there is nothing remotely reptilian about the True Power Bloodlines.
The only 'Reptilian' influences that are in anyway remotely involved
with this planet at this time, are those of the
Zeta Reticuli
and Alpha Draconis
systems. They are of no particular threat to you.
For those to whom it may be of some interest, we are of
Venusian
heritage, originally. What is another name that Venus is called by?
Connect the dots.
Well, that is all the questions I promised to answer out of the way, and
my time here is now pretty much expired. I have another few minutes
before I must finish preparing for my long journey. There was two later
posts, that I will just barely have time to offer a passing answer to:
ATS: I clearly know and are aware about this game
. But I have a
question to you.....
Do your 3-d families have fractions. Do they not know this, all of them.
Because they have try to kill me, and it will not work. of course.
HH: All I can say on this, is that even the Earthly lines of our
"extended" Family, only know as much as we tell them. Certain
information they may not use wisely, or with proper regard to our
Creator, and our One Infinite Creator.
As has been said before, "the top of the pyramid, is not the top of the
pyramid".
Above the highest Earthline auspices of the Supreme World Council (and
another higher aspect that cannot be named), are the "Hidden Hands" (not
the real name of course, but what we have sometimes been referred to).
ATS: Yes, however the things/thoughts/ideas! he is speaking of are
already a piece of copyrighted material and have been published in book
format with ISBN numbers and all. The books are called the Law of One.
This/these books deal with the very same ideas as the OP:
1. Negative and positive polarization
2. Degrees of density
3. Even the same exact term: social memory complex!
4. harvest is used in the same context
5. Evolution between densities
6. Logos and sub-logos are used in the same context
7. The same concept of Wanderers
8. The concept of Infinity becoming aware of itself
9. The same idea of vibrations in the same context
10. The concept of 'us' progressing to the fourth density with the next
harvest (2012) and how many of 'us' will have to repeat the third
density.
There are well over 50 examples of the same ideas and contexts between
the original author (L/L Research) and Hidden Hand.
L/L Research dates
back to the 1981 timeframe, thereby leading me to believe that they are
the original author. Again please note that the definition of plagiarism
is the unauthorized use or close imitation of the language and thoughts
of another author and the representation of them as one's own original
work.
Therefore, if Hidden Hand is not with L/L Research he is clearly
plagiarizing their ideas and thoughts.
ATS: Even Lucifer had to step in to help me. That was a surprise as you
can understand.
Does your left hand don't know what the right hand teach. Or is it lack
of understanding in certain members in your bloodline.
HH: Indeed, I understand, occasionally drastic intervention is required.
As I said, they do not know everything, somethings are best kept to
ourselves. Temptation can prove too great, when certain Powers lay in
the hands of those who's Heart is not utterly Pure of intention. Let us
just say, that some seem to enjoy the game a little TOO much, from time
to time.
Their actions were more from ignorance, than malicious intent toward
you. Please forgive them, as they knew not what they were doing, but
thought it the right thing.
Ok, I've just finished reading the last few pages of questions, I stated
now on a few occasions that I have no time left to answer, but I was
asked earlier a question that I said I'd finish with, namely that of "if
there was a question you had not yet been asked yet, would you consider
this it being asked", or words to that effect.
So there is one other question from the last pages that I will use in
that vein.
This will really have to be it though. I am truly sorry I cannot reply
to the many other heartfelt responses that sadly must remain unanswered.
We must be leaving for an important task in Rome, and already I have
others here with me imploring me "will you please just shut down that
flipping computer and get your things together". They are laughing at
how 'involved' I have become in this task of mine. My Father is teasing
that I should begin at early 6th Density again to balance my compassion.
Anyway, I must finish:
ATS: This has been very informative, and has cleared up much for me.
Thanks once again, Hidden Hand. My take on this is much different even
from what it was the last time I posted in this thread. So, hopefully
these questions will be a little more relevant...
1) I am curious as to how the bloodline family structure works. You said
there are people who are part of your "extended family" that we may know
of. So are these the
Rockefeller,
Rothschild,
Bush,
House of Windsor,
etc. (typically known in conspiracy circles as the
New World Order?).
How close is your interaction with your "extended family" and are they
as spiritually enlightened as you seem to be? Can you just kind of give
us an outline of how the family is structured, how much each level knows
in relation to the top, etc.? Because there are a lot of theories and
"know-it-alls" out there, and it would be nice to get it straight once
and for all. Be as detailed as you feel is appropriate.
HH: Ok, and this will have to be a really brief overview, as my time is
up.
Starting at the bottom level, you have what we call "Local Cell Groups"
or "Family Clusters". There will be anything from say five to thirty or
so of these, depending upon the size of the town or city in question.
Each Local area has it's own Council, comprised of Local Leaders
representing the Six Disciplines of learning. There is also either a
High Priest or High Priestess of The Order, who Serves their local
community.
Above this, you have the Regional Council, with the Leader of each Local
Council representing their specific areas. Then the National Council, in
the same vein, with the Leaders of the Regional Councils sitting to
represent their Regions.
Then you have the Supreme World Council above them all, with the
National Leaders representing their Countries. Above this, is another
group I cannot mention, who liaise with the "Hidden Hands".
Then above this, there are many other levels of Leadership, purely from
the Power Lines (the ones that are not of this planet). The Supreme
World Council, only know as much as is "Handed" down to them from us.
In our Power Lines, we have a similar structure, with Local and Regional
groups etc, though most of us are living in entirely 'different' types
of communities than you would understand. All I shall say is that we are
not "surface dwellers".
ATS: ...also, do people ever try to leave the family? I asked you to
comment on the
case of one "Svali" in an earlier post. I am still
curious if she was one of you or your extended family, or is she just a mis/disinfo agent.
HH: I am aware of her, yes. I've not looked at her supposed
"revelations" personally, though heard enough from others in my Family.
Yes, she was a part of the Family, at the lower levels, from the German
Lines I believe. As I understand, she did reveal a lot of truth about
the lower levels, but she was only Regional Level in the Earth Lines, so
not that high.
She certainly would not have had anything like the
"bigger picture". I understand that she went into detail about some of
the training techniques in the lower levels, which to be fair, can be
extremely harsh, though as I've said, it's all about reaching the 95%
Negativity, and when all is said and done, no matter how much one may
have suffered in this life-experience, we can never lose sight of the
fact that this is a Game we are all playing here together, and each
incarnating Soul has already chosen and agreed in advance the parts they
will play in the Game.
No one really suffers, except in the Game, and
ultimately, they have chosen these experiences before hand, at a Soul
level. No one is 'forced' to incarnate into a storyline they do not want
to play and learn from.
The German House is renowned for being particularly harsh and severe in
it's training, so much of what she shares may have happened, though my
Family have also said that unless her "trainers" were acting "out of
protocol" (abusing their power) much of what she 'revealed' would not
have happened, or has been embellished to some degree, for whatever
reason. I cannot comment myself, as I've had neither the time or
inclination to examine her story.
The world of my own Family is very
different from that of the lower Earth based bloodlines. Whilst our (my
own) training growing up was very strict and disciplined, we were never
abused in any way. We grew up with the bigger picture, and didn't need
any other motivation.
The Earth lines are not aware of the entire picture. They themselves are
not of our Lucifer Group Soul, and as far as they are aware, they are
out to 'rule the world', to Control and Enslave, and create as much
Suffering and Negativity as is humanly possible. That's what they 'get
out of the deal'. World Domination.
You'd have to say with that in mind,
they're doing a great job. But one of the things they don't know or
understand, is that our (Venusian Power Lines) agenda, is ultimately for
the Highest Good of all concerned, in providing you with the Catalyst.
If they were aware of this Truth, there is a slight risk that they would
not have done their jobs properly, and they would miss out on joining us
in our 95% Negative Harvest.
They are aware of the Harvest, and the need
for them to attain the 95%, to get out of 3rd Density, and that is all
the motivation they need to help us achieve our ultimate aims.
How they go about it, is not really of too great a concern to us, as
long as they are getting the job done. Sometimes we have to step in,
where something they may do or plan goes against our desires, but such
instances are few and far between.
And with that, I absolutely have to finish my time here with you. If I
leave it any longer, I am going to be late for my journey, and I will
not be very popular if I make my Family late. It is a strange feeling I
have now in my heart, as I write these last few lines. I never could
have imagined I would have 'connected' with you all in this way through
this discourse. It was never the original intention, just to put out the
information required of me.
But somewhere along this journey we have
taken together, I have come to feel a certain 'bond' with you. Of
course, I know that bond is our inherent Unity in our One Infinite
Creator, though, to have kind of 'met' and connected personally with so
many of you, has left me feeling somewhat saddened that our time has to
come to end. But come to an end it must.
I thank you sincerely for your gracious hospitality, and for allowing us
to 'use' your 'space' here, for the furthering of our message. And
remember, no matter the ideologies that may separate us in this Game,
the message is all that matters, and the message is, that in the Love,
and the Light of our Infinite Creator, we are All One. Brother's and
Sisters of the Light.
We wish you all the very best in what remains of your journeys here, and
sincerely hope for you that you will use the Catalyst we have offered
you, to in some way help you to Graduate with a glorious and Positive
Great Harvest.
Me on the other hand, I'm going to have to go and do some REALLY
Negative things now to make up for all this Positivity. Kind of amusing,
in an ironic way.
I look forward to meeting up with so many of you when the Game is over,
and enjoying reminiscing about this time, and the parts we have all
played in this Great Game.
We leave you all in the Love, and the Light of our One Infinite Creator.
