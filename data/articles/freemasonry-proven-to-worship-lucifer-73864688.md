Rituals of Freemasonry Freemasonry Proven To Worship Lucifer
Part 3 of 5
Once you understand what is going on in the world you can then recognize evidences of Satanism in so many, many places.
THE PENTAGRAM It was proven from Masonic books that Masons worship both Lucifer and Satan. They serve both the "good" Lucifer and the "evil" Satan. They believe that both good and evil exist in equal measure in the world.
They also believe good cannot exist without an equally powerful evil. This belief is the reason we see both type of 5-pointed stars within Masonry; the star with the upright single point is a symbol of the "good" Lucifer, while the star with the two points upward is a symbol of the "evil" Satan. It also takes 33 degrees of rotation of a pentagram (one point up) to achieve a Satanic pentagram (two points up). Coincidence?
I don't think so.
The women's division of Freemasonry, Eastern Star (above right) is based upon the "evil Satan" Star, the Goats Head of Mendes. This is one of the Infernal Names of Satan within Satanism. In looking at the Eastern Star Goatshead (above right), the star itself is a Goatshead, and the star in the middle is a plain Goatshead, which is within an inverted pentacle. In one symbol there are three instances of inverted pentagrams. So, just how important is the Pentagram to the Satanist? Listen to the Witch of Salem, Massachusetts, Laura Cabot, on this question. In her book, Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment, Cabot says,
"It really isn't that difficult to distinguish the Craft from Satanism. Witches wear the pentacle with the point up. Satanists reverse it with the point down ..."
Once we examine the two symbols above, both Masonic, we can only conclude that Freemasonry admittedly serves both the "good Lucifer" and the "evil Satan!" Cabot has more to say on page 93, about the significance of the Pentagram to witchcraft.
"It [Pentagram] consists of a five-pointed star inside a circle. It is the key symbol of the Craft. It is the witch's Mandala ...."
The Pentagram, inside a circle or with no circle, is the key symbol of witchcraft. Both "good" and "evil" pentagrams are within Freemasonry in abundance.
THE TRIANGLE -- CONTINUED FROM PREVIOUS ARTICLE
The Triangle wasn't the first subject mentioned on this page because the Pentagram is far more important to their practice of Witchcraft. The triangle is part and parcel of the Pentagram. The triangle plays a big part within the Hexagram as well.
FREEMASONRY TEACHES MAN IS BECOMING GOD To the occultist, the triangle is very important. It is used constantly in every conceivable manner. It is used either with the point up or down.
When you see the point down, this represents the Deity and is called the Deity's Triangle or the Water Triangle. The Earthly Triangle or Pyramid Triangle is what it is called when one point is up. It "symbolizes the PERFECT OR DIVINE MAN." This quote is not from some heinous Black-hooded Satanist, it comes from a 33rd Degree Masonic author named George Steinmetz [Freemasonry: Its Hidden Meaning , New York, Macoy Publishing and Masonic Supply Company, 1948, p. 63, repeated on p. 67] Freemasonry joins all pagan groups in saying that man can become "divine" or "perfect." In another book, George returns to this theme once again:
"Be still -- and know -- that I am God ... That I AM GOD -- the final recognition of the All in All, the unity of the Self with the Cosmos -- the cognition of the DIVINITY OF THE SELF!" [George H. Steinmetz, The Lost Keys of Freemasonry, Richmond, Virginia, Macoy Publishing and Masonic Supply Company, 1923, p. 92]
"Be still -- and know -- that I am God ... That I AM GOD -- the final recognition of the All in All, the unity of the Self with the Cosmos -- the cognition of the DIVINITY OF THE SELF!"
[George H. Steinmetz, The Lost Keys of Freemasonry, Richmond, Virginia, Macoy Publishing and Masonic Supply Company, 1923, p. 92]
Freemasonry has been so sensitive about any of its secrets ever becoming public knowledge. Masons in every age knew that if the general public knew the Satanic core that existed in the heart of Freemasonry, the organization would either go into oblivion or would be arrested and put in jail. Now you know why Freemasonry insists that its Initiates pledge that, if they divulge any of Masonry's secrets, he would agree to having his throat slit and be disemboweled. Manly P. Hall, another 33rd Degree Mason, writes,
"Man is a God in the making ..." [The Lost Keys of Freemasonry, p. 92]
"Man is a God in the making ..."
[The Lost Keys of Freemasonry, p. 92]
Masonic author, Joseph Fort Newton, clearly and boldly states,
".. to the profoundest insight of the human soul -- that God becomes man that man may become God." [The Religion of Freemasonry: An Interpretation, Macoy Publishing and Masonic Supply Company, 1969, p. 37]
".. to the profoundest insight of the human soul -- that God becomes man that man may become God."
[The Religion of Freemasonry: An Interpretation, Macoy Publishing and Masonic Supply Company, 1969, p. 37]
MASONRY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT FREEMASONRY ORIGINATED IN THE PLACE WHERE SATAN DWELLS!
Albert Churchward, another Masonic author states that the triangle pointing upward us a symbol for Set, which is one of the Infernal Names for Satan. [Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man , George Allen and Company, Ltd., 1913, p. 189, 309, and 471]. Then, Masonic author, J.S.M. Ward states,
"With the point upwards, the equilateral triangle stands for Shiva the Destroyer and signifies the flame which rises upwards from the funeral pyre toward Heaven. This symbol is familiar to us in several degrees, most notably the Thirtieth degree." [Freemasonry and the Ancient Gods, 1921; also reported by Masonic authors William Meyer, The Order of the Eastern Star, p. 20; Alain Danielou, The Gods of India]

Shiva is another name for Satan in the occult. The triangle with one point pointing up is a symbol for Satan. Most likely this is the reason why the pyramid is such an important symbol to the Mason. This is the symbol on the reverse of the one dollar bill. This symbol contains two triangles: the Pyramid itself and the All-Seeing Eye of Horus (Osiris).
Occultists know that both Horus and Osiris are alternate names for Satan. There is one more proof from Masonic authors, that Satan is the one they worship.
Masonic authors tell us that they worship Lucifer in yet another way. Lynn Perkins (a Masonic Author), states that
"Shamballa has a bearing on the ancient origins of Freemasonry and upon its future in the coming Aquarian Age ..." [Masonry In The New Age, p. 56]
"Shamballa has a bearing on the ancient origins of Freemasonry and upon its future in the coming Aquarian Age ..."
[Masonry In The New Age, p. 56]
Then, on pages 55-56, Perkins says that today's Mason has no idea that Freemasonry comes from such an ancient, esoteric source. Most Masons today understand that the roots of their organization are in Satanism. When Perkins said that Freemasonry had its origins in Shamballa, he just identified Masonry as Satanic.
Alice Bailey, with her Demon Master - Master D.K. - writing through her, stated that
"Shamballa is the mythological place where the 'Lord of the World', Sanat Kumara, or Shiva , is supposed to live." [Discipleship in the New Age].
"Shamballa is the mythological place where the 'Lord of the World', Sanat Kumara, or Shiva , is supposed to live."
[Discipleship in the New Age].
Masonic author, Perkins, has just admitted that Freemasonry originated in the place where Shiva (Satan) lives.
Manly P. Hall, 33rd Degree Mason, K.T., in his book, Initiates of the Flame boldly admits Freemasonry is from Hell:
"Those who follow the path of faith (or the heart) use water and are known as the Sons of Seth, while those who follow the path of the mind and action are the Sons of Cain, who was the son of SAMAEL , the Spirit of Fire. Today, we find the latter among the alchemists, the Hermetic philosophers, the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons." [p. 20]
"Those who follow the path of faith (or the heart) use water and are known as the Sons of Seth, while those who follow the path of the mind and action are the Sons of Cain, who was the son of SAMAEL , the Spirit of Fire. Today, we find the latter among the alchemists, the Hermetic philosophers, the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons."
[p. 20]
Hall places Freemasonry among the circle of the damned -- Sons of Cain , who rebelled against God; alchemists who are known sorcerers, Black Magicians, and worshippers of Satan, and the Rosicrucians who have so desecrated the precious cross of Jesus Christ with Pentagrams and Hexagrams as to make you sick. Hall's major revelation was that Freemasonry is the son of SAMAEL. being careful not to confuse Samael with the beloved prophet Samuel. SAMAEL is one of the Infernal Names of Satan. In fact, House of Theosophy author, writing under the influence of her demon possessing her -- Master D.K. -- identifies SAMAEL as Satan! [The Secret Doctrine] In fact, Satanists have a symbol of SAMAEL. The pentagram on the left with the one point up represents the Divine Man specifically and Lucifer the good god generally; the pentagram on the right with two stars up and the goats head is called the Goats Head of Mendes by most Satanists, but Black Magick Satanists call him SAMAEL.
