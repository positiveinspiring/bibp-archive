Does Pope Francis intend to help the
global elite achieve their goal of uniting all of the religions of
the world under a single banner?
-
Will he be instrumental in establishing
a single global religion for the glorious new age that the global
elite believe is coming?
After he was elected, the cover of Time Magazine
declared Pope Francis to be the New
World Pope, and since his election Pope Francis has made it abundantly
clear that he is going to make ecumenical outreach a top priority.
He has spoken of his determination
to continue on the path of ecumenical dialogue, and he has already held
a number of very high profile ecumenical meetings.
Not only has he worked hard to reach out to
leaders from various Christian traditions, he has also made it a point to
try to acknowledge the mutual bonds that he feels with all other religions.
For example, in one
recent address he made it a point to say that he believes that Muslims
worship and pray to the one God that he also worships. This all roads lead to the same God philosophy
is a hallmark of
the one world religion that
the global elite have been
slowly building toward for decades.
The global elite know that even with a one world
economy and a one world government, humanity will never be truly united
until there is a single global religion.
Unfortunately, this one world
religion that they are seeking to establish is diametrically opposed to the
Christianity that we find in the Bible.
By throwing out Biblical truth for the sake of friendship
between men and women of different religious traditions, is Pope
Francis fundamentally betraying the faith that he claims to represent?
If there is going to be a one world religion,
there will have to be a bond formed between Roman Catholicism and Islam.
They are the two largest religious traditions on the planet, and so any
truly global religion would definitely require the participation of both
of them.
That is one reason why what
Pope Francis has
already had to say about Islam is so noteworthy.
The following comes from remarks that he made
during his very first ecumenical meeting
I then greet and cordially thank you all,
dear friends belonging to other religious traditions; first of all the
Muslims, who worship the one God, living and merciful, and call upon Him
in prayer, and all of you.
I really appreciate your presence: in it I
see a tangible sign of the will to grow in mutual esteem and cooperation
for the common good of humanity.
The Catholic Church is aware of the
importance of promoting friendship and respect between men and women of
different religious traditions - I wish to repeat this: promoting
friendship and respect between men and women of different religious
traditions - it also attests the valuable work that the Pontifical
Council for interreligious dialogue performs.
But are Allah and the God of the Bible the
same thing? Of course not.
For example, Christians believe that Jesus
Christ is God. Muslims deny this vehemently. For much more on why
Allah and the God of the Bible are not the same, please see
this article.
So either Pope Francis is denying the divinity
of Jesus Christ, or he is exhibiting a frightening ignorance of basic
Christian theology, or there is some other agenda at work here.
During
that same ecumenical meeting, Pope Francis also made it a point to state
that he feels close to those that belong to any religious tradition
In this, we feel close even to all those men
and women who, whilst not recognizing themselves belonging to any
religious tradition, feel themselves nevertheless to be in search of
truth, goodness and beauty, this truth, goodness and beauty of God, and
who are our precious allies in efforts to defend the dignity of man, in
building a peaceful coexistence among peoples and in guarding Creation
carefully.
It is one thing to love people and to seek to
build friendships with them, but it is another thing entirely to throw out
the most basic beliefs of the faith that you supposedly represent in order
to promote a specific agenda.
And Pope Francis definitely appears to
have an agenda.
On
another occasion, Pope Francis declared that it was time to intensify
dialogue with other religions, and that he was,
thinking
particularly of dialogue with Islam.
But this affinity for Islam did not just begin
recently.
The truth is that Pope Francis was working hard
to build bridges with Islam
even when he was the Archbishop of Buenos Aires
His humility drew my attention, Sheik
Mohsen Ali, an important Islamic leader in Argentina, told the Buenos
Aires Herald. He always showed himself a friend of the Islamic
community.
And Pope Francis has a reputation for being a
cleric that really knows
Islam
Sumer Noufouri, secretary-general of the
Islamic Center of the Republic of Argentina, told the Buenos Aires
Herald that the new pope is a respectful, pro-dialogue person who knows
Islam.
But of course Pope Francis is not just reaching
out to the Islamic world.
He has also been working hard to intensify
dialogue with other Christian traditions.
In particular, he seems
quite interested in improving relations with the Orthodox churches of
the east
Before his address, the pope had a private
meeting with
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew from Istanbul, who attended
Franciss inaugural Mass on Tuesday.
It was the first time the spiritual head of
Orthodox Christians had attended a Roman popes inaugural Mass since the
Great Schism between western and eastern Christianity in 1054.
At Wednesdays meeting, Francis called
Bartholomew my brother Andrew, a reference to the apostle who was the
brother of St. Peter and was the first bishop of the Church of
Byzantium.
Francis also held a private session with
Metropolitan Hilarion, the foreign minister of the Russian Orthodox
Church, the largest in the Orthodox world.
It wont happen tomorrow, of course, but could
Pope Francis be the Pope that brings the Roman Catholics and the Orthodox
back together?
And of course a one world religion will not
appear overnight either. There are far too many differences to overcome
right now.
But as the world becomes increasingly unstable,
people are going to be looking for answers. After the world is ravaged by
economic collapse, food shortages, nightmarish pandemics, unprecedented
natural disasters and horrifying wars, will it finally be ready for a one
world religion that promises peace and friendship among all of the
religions of the globe?
This is something to watch for in the years
ahead.
The global elite desperately want a single global religion, and they
will keep moving things in that direction. For now, Pope Francis just seems to be laying
the groundwork for the one world religion that is coming.
There is a 900-year-old prophecy that indicates
that Pope Francis could be
the last Pope.
If that prophecy is true, then it will be very
important to watch the actions of this Pope very carefully.
