It doesn't happen often, but The New York Times (NYT) has truthfully
reported on something recently.
On what did it report?
Well, on itself, and how alarmed it is due to
its own increasing irrelevance in the face of new sources of information.
NYT is well-aware of the "New Media," as a 96-page internal report, sent to
top executives last month, makes clear.
Obtained by Buzzfeed,
the report,
"paints a dark picture of a newsroom
struggling more dramatically than is immediately visible to adjust to
the digital world, a newsroom that is hampered primarily by its own
storied culture."
The report ignores its traditional mainstream
(MSM) competitors and takes a closer look at new digital companies like,
-
First Look Media
-
Vox
-
Huffington Post
-
Business Insider
-
Buzzfeed
"They are ahead of us in building impressive
support systems for digital journalists, and that gap will grow unless
we quickly improve our capabilities," the report states.
"Meanwhile, our
journalism advantage is shrinking as more of these upstarts expand their
newsrooms."
"We are not moving with enough urgency," it says.
A central issue for NYT is,
"a cadre of editors who remain unfamiliar
with the web."
"Many desks lack editors who even know how to evaluate digital work,"
the report continues.
A few suggestions NYT is looking into is a TED
talks-style event series and an expanded op-ed platform, including
location-based local news and information.
But it is too late...
STATING THE OBVIOUS
At the very least, thank you, NYT, for stating the truth even though it was
an internal document not meant for the public... and, even if it was already
painfully obvious.
Still it took bravery for such a dinosaur to admit its
own obsolescence.
The paper's model is obsolete, but even worse than the model has been the
paper's lack of interest in the truth.
As the US empire has grown more out of control,
more dangerous, and more insane, the NYT has functioned as a fourth branch
of government, a gatekeeper for a totalitarian world a la
1984 or
Brave New
World. But the gig is up.
The world knows NYT's complicity in erecting a
sick and deranged world, and unless the paper breaks major news stories and
outs itself as an undeniable friend of freedom, it will continue to lose
revenue.
No more can NYT expect to serve the elite and its bottom line at
the same time.
In the age of the Internet, what
David Rockefeller was once grateful for
is no longer possible:
"We are grateful to the Washington Post, the
New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose
directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of
discretion for almost forty years...
It would have been impossible for us to
develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of
publicity during those years.
But, the world is more sophisticated and
prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational
sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely
preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past
centuries."
Mainstream media is definitely dying, and this
is a VERY good thing.
The root of the word government combine as "to
control minds." The root of the word "govern" is control and the root of "ment"
is mind. Without control over minds via the media, the government will lose
all control.
More young people now get their news from the
Internet than television. In mere years most everybody will get their news
from the Internet because nobody will trust the mainstream:
This data shows that it is really only those
over 65 years old who are still completely brainwashed.
Not all, of course. But many or most. The good
news is they will be dying soon along with their interest in voting.
Newsweek (which I call Newspeak) has
released its last print issue. You'll remember one of Newsweek's last
attempts to be relevant again was uncovering the wrong Satoshi Nakamoto
as the creator of bitcoin.
They found some guy with the right name in the
phone book... You know, "quality journalism"...
Clearly the only valuable part of MSM media
sites is in the comments section which debunks 90% of the articles
published. Popular Science was so
overwhelmed by people bringing facts into many of their articles that
the site shut off its comments section.
CNN's viewership is at a
record-low (the network recently laid off 40 journalists), while CNBC
has
suffered a viewership collapse as well... and this with the Dow at all
time inflated highs.
Imagine if the stock market were going down how
low these numbers would be.
But once Larry King said that CNN would be
better off showing re-runs of Spongebob Squarepants 24 hours a day,
you knew it was over...
Larry King left CNN because he knew it
would collapse.
He left CNN
for the Russian government
propaganda channel,
RT, because it is more respected and
features more truth about the West. Twenty years ago, this would be have
been unheard of for Larry King! A career-ender! Not today... Nope.
Today it is a respect-earner. Oh, how things
have changed...
THE NEW MEDIA TAKEOVER
The New Media has taken over. Alex Jones is
almost a household name and groups like Luke Rudkowski's
We Are Change
have revolutionized how people get information.
(Editor's Note: We Are Change
offers "Change
Media University" to learn how to become a real investigative journalist
that we highly recommend. Forget traditional school).
For years now the most popular MSM
personalities, like Glenn Beck, have followed the playbook of new
media personalities in a bid to remain relevant. Now, in order to remain
relevant people like Glenn Beck need to quote or interview people in the
"alternative media".
It was not all that long ago that John Kerry
and
Zbigniew Brzezinski said that the
Internet, simply put, is making it hard for them to govern.
Secretary of 'Statism,' John Kerry, before a
group of State Department workers told
the audience that the world has been "complicated" by,
"...this little thing called the
Internet and the ability of people everywhere to communicate
instantaneously and to have more information coming at them in one day
than most people can process in months or a year."
According to Kerry,
the
Internet,
"makes it much harder to govern, makes it
much harder to organize people, much harder to find the common
interest."
Z-Big
echoed his sentiment, saying that public access to information stopped
war with Syria.
Bill Clinton, laughingly even suggested
the need for a "Ministry
of Truth" over the Internet, run by the US federal government, that
would censor anything it did not deem to be "truth".
In 5-10 years people will look at you funny if
you tell them you watch mainstream media.
Why? Because there is no real information nor
substance on mainstream media.
