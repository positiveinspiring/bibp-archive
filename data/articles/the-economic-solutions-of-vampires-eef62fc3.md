The vampire bat is a horrifying pig-nosed wart
of a creature which feasts in a manner that, believe it or not, is a rather
familiar scene to those of us who closely study alternative economics.
After erratically flittering about in the
sinking evening sky, it targets the warmth of a sleeping farm animal and
latches onto it with its claws. Carefully, it inserts a fang into a vein
dense region of the creature's body, and laps away at the blood. Normally,
the oblivious livestock are completely unaware and helpless to the attack.
The tiny parasite does not inflict an immediately mortal blow to its host,
but over time, disease and physical debilitation result.
The vampire has destroyed the animal, and,
pathetically, the animal has no idea.
Just as in nature, the economic world has its own bloodsucking vermin in the
form of banking elites which are a wretched drain on the whole of the human
race. Without their vicious and predatory presence, I envision a world so
rapturously above and beyond what we wallow in today that it is impossible
to describe.
The disgust many feel when considering the
virulent feeding habits of the common mosquito or the slithering leech does
nothing to compare to the utter gut churning revulsion I feel when studying
the financial habits of banks like
the Federal Reserve and the
"too big to
fails".
They are without a doubt the most malignant form
of social cancer imaginable.
And yet, after nearly four years of ongoing fiscal exsanguination, a sizable
portion of the American populace is still looking to these pests for
economic comfort and reassurance, just like farm animals consistently
grazing near the entrance of a vampire bat cave, as if it is a shelter from
harm. Worst of all is the willingness by which investors still, to this day,
commit their savings and their livelihoods to the stock market meat grinder.
Let's be honest; the typical American daytrading
investor is a complete moron. They have absolutely no sense of the
fundamentals of our financial structure nor the eccentric rules by which it
operates. They only have the faintest inkling of the functions of the highly
manipulated stock market. They foolishly believe that what little money they
make today riding the wave of an illegitimate liquidity driven rally they
will actually get to keep.
For them, stock investment is no different from
buying a scratch-off lotto ticket at a hillbilly gas station; it is a cheap
and tawdry game rife with failure but exciting to play, if only for a
fleeting guilt addled thrill.
To be fair, they play because the game is indeed "rewarding", at least,
initially. The first taste is so sweet that it soils the plasma; the very
skin of the cellular membrane of the financial mind becomes saturated. It
swells within the weakening heart of a culture, and overrides its sense of
logic. It makes us do terrible and stupid things, and we clasp our hands
together and pray that it will never end.
But, of course, an ending is painfully
inevitable. The more we indulge, the more it takes down the road to satisfy
us. We become an addict nation, riding the chemical wave of a pharmaceutical
roller coaster fed by the opiates of fiat and fantasy.
The bottom line; we are being drained of our lifeblood as a country.
However, the mainstream media is rife with talk of "recovery", and one might
ask how this could be possible.
An overwhelming spectrum of solutions has been
presented over the past 3-4 years, and each one has given the stock market a
little push towards the green, so what's the problem?
The problem is, the actions taken by our government and banking elites have
built the connecting strands of a spider's web, instead of a safety net.
Let's examine some the most common solutions presented to the increasingly
desperate American public and why these delusions have lulled us into the
role of victim in the most elaborate monster movie of all time
Centralization As a
Solution To
Centralization
?
Europe's current disintegration is a perfect example of this strange and
ultimately destructive policy.
The EU as an experiment is an utter disaster.
Once the jewel of the open border dynamic and a bastion of the "merits" of
globalization, the economic union has been exposed as a kind of waxwork
museum; a tourist trap curiosity filled with illusions of life, but rather
hollow upon closer inspection.
Half of the countries committed to the EU are burdened with liabilities well
beyond the 60% debt to GDP ratio outlined in the Growth and Stability
Pact'. Some countries, including Greece, met few if any of the presented
criteria for membership and were allowed to join anyway.
The only reason the system was able to function
at all was due to the imaginary wealth of the toxic derivative framework
which now no longer exists.
The problem with globalization is that it requires assimilation; it demands
that sovereign nations adopt the fiscal character of their neighbors in
order to present the face of a single entity. Of course, when these
countries are unable to do this because of their cultural differences, or
their incongruent economies, something has to be slapped together instead.
Artificially tying together societies by forcing
them to financially harmonize is, in my view, a criminal act of
collectivism. Now that this crime is being unveiled for all the world to
see, though, the corrupt governments and banking puppeteers of Europe have
suggested even MORE of the same!
That's right
their solution to the collapse of
the EU is a harmonization not just of finance, but of politics and law.
A
single governing body which would dictate every nuance of the union.
The claim that Europe was not centralized enough, and that this is what
caused the breakdown, is absolutely preposterous.
Globalization makes a
system inflexible and weak. If any portion of that system fails, it sends
shockwaves through the rest. This is because centralization removes the
protections of independently insulated structures and allows corrupt policy
to spread like a plague.
As the economic situation grows more dire, the
end result will always be a reduction in the common citizen's standard of
living. In harmonization, It is far easier to make everyone equally poor
than it is to make them equally rich.
With a single, narrow minded leadership,
especially one that is completely unaccountable to the people, the EU will
become the most fragile makeshift empire in history, and a model for a
global government that hopefully will never exist.
Print To Avoid The
Pain
I can't tell you how truly exhausted I am with the constant rehashing of
bailout bills and cheap lending windows as if they have ever or will ever
change anything.
Let's make this clear:
-
Keynesian stimulus
measures are useless. They will always be useless
-
Governments do NOT create
jobs, they destroy them
-
Central banks do NOT create wealth, they dilute it
-
Quantitative easing and zero interest lending does NOT diminish debt, it
displaces it; removing it from the shoulders of private corporate banking
institutions where it belongs and dumping it in the laps of taxpayers
I'll say it again; the debts created by major
banks have not been paid. They have been handed to you, and your children.
Forget the December Santa Rally and the temporary holiday job boost.
Nothing
has changed
since 2008. The process of transferring private debt into public obligation is a tool of
economic vampires.
The utility in this is obvious. A program of wealth
transference has the ability to prolong full collapse while at the same time
giving the impression of stability. The dollar itself characterizes this
conflict. The currency has been overprinted since the credit crisis began by
some estimates in the ten's of trillions.
Not only has it been devalued to temporarily
stave off a purging in the U.S., but now also in Europe. And yet, the dollar
index, which supposedly measures the Greenback's global value, has spiked.
We are lulled into a sense of safety by such arbitrary measurements, but our
buying power is being subversively annihilated.
In less than a year's time, those who dove into
the dollar as a safe haven will discover their bones picked clean by
predatory banks and hidden flesh eating inflation.
Count on it
Create A New Currency
Globalists love currencies, as long as they aren't tied down by a commodity.
For central bankers, each fiat currency is a
stepping stone to something more sinister. They are disposable. They are
expendable. Like toothbrushes. Yes
even the dollar. And in this rests the
key to economic control.
A currency is a symbol of trade and labor; if you
can create and destroy that symbol at will, then you can dominate trade and
labor.
Through a mere piece of paper, you manipulate
the very breath of social life. No one should be given that kind of power
without uncompromising transparency and constant public governance, but the
Federal Reserve is free from both.
The suggestion that we can solve our current financial despair with the
formation of a whole new currency, or a global currency, is like suggesting
to a slave that he would be much more free with a shinier set of chains.
Any solution that purports to undo the crisis by
doing more of the same was probably devised by an economic vampire.
This includes digital currencies like the failed "Bitcoin", which swagger
about in the classy looking threads of technology and diversity while
flashing us impromptu peace signs. Digital currencies are a Star Trek theme
park distraction, and just like any paper fiat currency, they make promises
they cannot keep.
Any trade system that depends upon good faith in
ones and zeros traveling across a network of machines that can be hacked or
rendered useless by collapse is doomed. We have already tasted the danger of
digital through the debauchery of credit cards.
Why tempt fate even further?
More Regulation And
Control
Regulation is not the problem in America's economy; the REGULATORS are the
problem with America's economy.
The SEC is given thousands of potential
investigations a year to pursue, but rarely do they ever follow through, and
when they do, it's to throw the angry masses a
Bernie Madoff or two; an act
of insincere appeasement in light of much greater fraud.
Being that true free markets have not existed for at least a century, the
insinuation that free markets are the root of the collapse is a bit absurd.
The guidelines for government oversight of business in the U.S. already
exist; government has just refused to implement them. Adding new
restrictions to an already restricted market will change nothing.
Therefore, the only solution that makes any
sense whatsoever as far as regulation is to wipe the slate clean entirely:
I have heard it said that the philosophy of our economic system is the
problem. This is an ignorant cop-out. The principals of free markets are not
the issue; the men who abuse them and diminish them, on the other hand, are.
Anyone who suggests that we as a country should
focus our anger on the idea of the system rather than the men behind the
misuse of that system is, without a doubt, an economic vampire.
Lurking in the
Shadows...
The question of solutions is difficult, not because there aren't any, but
because those that will actually succeed require pain, sacrifice, and
incredible hard work.
Most people don't like to think about that sort
of thing. This is why global banks and their proponents have been able to
maintain the recovery magic act for the past few years (just barely), and it
is why the useless concepts they put forward are still given public
consideration. We WANT to be sold on the proposal of an easy way out.
One rule to never forget when considering any solution is to take into
account who benefits most from its implementation, and who has to labor for
its success.
If average people are forced to exert all the
effort, and an elite few reap all the substantial benefits, this
contradiction outweighs any assertion of practicality. It is not worth our
time, nor our energy, to shadowbox reality. Unfortunately, this is all we
have been doing as a nation
since 2008.
The creeping terror that lay ahead is not the economic collapse, but the men
who would use it to their favor. The stakes are high. With
the NDAA and
similar bills in place, fiscal distress is no longer just a matter of
economics, but a matter of personal liberty.
Without a doubt, a collapse will be used as
a
rationalization for totalitarianism.
If we do not make the hard decisions now, and
take it upon ourselves to construct our own localized economies separate and
insulated from the mainstream, we will, indeed, find ourselves one day
cowering in the dark of a long drawn night infested with fiends, and
desperate enough to actually ask them for help.
They will be happy to give it, at a very bloody
price
