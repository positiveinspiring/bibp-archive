On Wednesday, July 28th, 41 countries have abstained in the United Nations General Assembly vote on Bolivias resolution to recognize access to water and sanitation as basic human rights.
Rather than honestly vote no, they abstained to avoid being labeled as opponents of access to water, but many made statements that reveal their hostility to the very idea of recognizing water as a human right.
