The EU's ruling elites in Brussels are going all
out for the May European Parliament elections, attempting to expand their
powers throughout the continent and beat back a growing rebellion against
centralization.
Viviane Reding (image above-right), the
controversial and voluble European justice commissioner, was in London on
February 10 for a public debate on "The Future of Europe," part of a
"Citizens' Dialogue" series launched by the commission in 2013 as a key
element of a year-long propaganda blitz.
That blitz is aimed at influencing the vote for
the 751 members of the European Parliament in elections that will take place
in every member state from May 22-25.
Reding's event in London, according to the EU
Commission's press office, was the 44th of "more than 47 such meetings"
planned throughout the continent, together with a massive propaganda
campaign involving television programming, social media trolling, literature
distribution, and other costly schemes that have been drawing widespread
criticism, even from political and media sectors that are normally
supportive of the EU.
As The New American's Bob Adelmann
reported recently, Reding struck a raw
nerve with her January federalism speech calling for transforming the
European Union into a United States of Europe, with even greater and more
centralized powers.
It was but the latest, blatant confirmation from
a top-level Eurocrat vindicating the warnings of critics that the proponents
of "an ever closer union" really intended to completely eradicate the
national sovereignty of EU member states and turn the EU into an omnipotent
government over the entire continent.
Of course, for most of the past nearly six
decades of the EU's existence (in its various permutations) its leaders and
promoters have publicly, vociferously denied that they desired, or were
working toward a federal United States of Europe - even while virtually
every action they took (as well as their revealed private statements) proved
otherwise.
Two and a half decades ago, in an April 10, 1989 article entitled
"United States of Europe," The New American detailed the
explicit, concrete steps that were being taken, as well as the many
admissions by key EU architects, that belied the denials of the
crypto-federalists concerning their true goals.
Now that the centralization and consolidation
schemes are so flagrant as to be undeniable, the EU plotters are trying to
bribe, bully, coerce, frighten, seduce, and threaten the increasingly
resistant EU inhabitants into accepting the final coup de grace to their
liberties.
However, the EU-mandated taxpayer bailouts of the big European
and Wall Street banks, along with monetary and regulatory policies that have
clobbered EU economies, have taken a huge toll on EU credibility and
popularity.
The truculence of Reding and her boss, Commission President
José
Manuel Barroso (image above-left), are adding to the growing outrage and anger
toward Brussels.
The anti-EU sentiments are running especially strong in
Britain, Germany, Austria, Greece, Cyprus, Hungary, and the Netherlands (the
latter of which was a founding member of the six-nation pact that grew into
the EU).
Commissioner Reding has attacked as "extremist"
British concerns over the massive illegal migration into the U.K. and
British efforts to curtail benefits to migrants. She has been joined in
these attacks by EU politicians such as Barroso and EU Employment
Commissioner Laszlo Andor, who have characterized the British efforts as
"nasty" and "pandering" to xenophobia and hate.
In her February 10 London debate, Reding said it
is important for British voters to see accurate "facts and figures on the
table" about the EU before May's European elections.
The headline for a BBC
story on the event
reads:
"'Give UK voters facts' - EU Commissioner
Viviane Reding."
Her comments were rich in the brazen hypocrisy
category, given that the European Commission has been repeatedly lambasted
for being extremely secretive and nontransparent, as well as for habitually
misstating the facts and promoting falsehoods.
And Reding herself is an
attendee of the very
secretive Bilderberg conferences; when questioned in
the past about her participation at Bilderberg, she has invoked the "Chatham
House rule," the vow of secrecy that applies to all attendees.
With the 2014 European Parliament elections
coming in less than 100 days, the commission is under fire from a wide array
of critics for costly EU propaganda campaigns that are not only a wasteful
expense in a time of austerity, but a violation of the supposed neutrality
of the EU institutions in electoral politics.
European Commission chief Barroso,
reports the UK's Telegraph, recently,
"asked his commissioners to send him
five-page eulogies - with pictures - of their good works to fill a
pro-EU 'booklet' ahead of the European elections in May."
"The commission already spends an enormous
amount on propaganda," said Geoffrey Van Orden, a Conservative MEP for
the East of England region. "This is another example of its efforts at
self-promotion at our expense."
Euronews, the multilingual news channel based in
Lyon, France, is notorious as a propaganda outlet for the European
Commission, which is its major source of funding.
But amidst Brussels'
demands since the financial crisis for "austerity" and belt-tightening from
national and local governments and citizens, the commission's spending on Euronews has continued to climb. So it is with the EU's spending across the
board for propaganda that polishes the EU image and argues for "an ever
closer union" (meaning one in which Brussels gains more and more powers).
In 2011, the EU opened an extravagant new
multi-million-dollar European Parliament visitor center in Brussels, called
the Parliamentarium, which the British group Taxpayers Alliance (TPA)
designated as "propaganda central."
The lavish edifice, which ran millions
of Euros over budget in projected construction costs, is but one of many
targets cited by angry European taxpayers.
TPA says of the Parliamentarium:
And be in no doubt, it is propaganda central.
The room entitled "United in Diversity" features "a walk-on map spread out
over the floor, showing a Europe without borders" and enables visitors to,
"interactively acquire information on events that caused the European
Parliament to draw up regulations that are valid and applicable throughout
Europe".
It includes a "light installation" entitled "Sky
of Opinions", while a special effort has been made to indoctrinate children
of the need for the European Union to exist, with a mock-up of the
Parliament chamber.
Again, according to the official blurb, this will enable
them to "learn what it means to actively participate in the idea of a united
Europe."
Brussels' Costly
"Twitter Trolls"
Last year leaked documents exposed the EU
Commission's use of millions of Euros in taxpayer funds to troll the
Internet and propagandize for pro-EU sentiments.
Bruno Waterfield, Brussels
correspondent for The Daily Telegraph,
wrote:
The Daily Telegraph has seen
confidential spending proposals and internal documents planning an
unprecedented propaganda blitz ahead of and during European elections in
June 2014.
Key to a new strategy will be "public opinion
monitoring tools" to "identify at an early stage whether debates of
political nature among followers in social media and blogs have the
potential to attract media and citizens' interest"
"Particular attention needs to be paid to the
countries that have experienced a surge in Euroskepticism," said a
confidential document agreed to last year.
The EU plans also called for another installment
on the $100-million "House of European History" museum to "promote awareness
of European identity." Naturally, "European identity" in this instance means
identification with, and support for, the European "Project."
The Daily Telegraph reported:
Paul Nuttall, UKIP's deputy leader, has attacked
the proposals, which he said, violate the neutrality of the EU civil service
by turning officials into a "troll patrol", stalking the internet to make
unwanted and provocative political contributions in social media debates.
"Spending over a million pounds for EU public
servants to become Twitter trolls in office hours is wasteful and truly
ridiculous," he said.
"It strikes me as bizarre that the EU
administration is playing such an explicitly political role with a brief to
target Euroskeptics - that's code for parties like Ukip, and this is hardly
neutral."
Among the many other propaganda programs
sponsored by the EU politburo is a series of high-profile celebrity ReACT
conferences it has sponsored.
"The European Parliament held its latest
ReACT conference in Rome, one of five held throughout Europe on
different themes ahead of the May 2014 European Elections," a European
Parliament news release stated on January 24, 2014.
"The conference took place in Cinecittà, the
legendary cinema studios on 23 January. Health, sustainability and food
were on the menu of the day for the experts and other interested people
attending the event."
The three speakers at the EU confab were,
-
Professor Riccardo Valentini, a so-called climate
'expert'
-
Italian chef and
TV star Carlo Cracco
-
TV journalist and health guru Michele Mirabella
The Rome conference was the fourth ReACT event.
The first ReACT affair took place in Paris and focused on employment; the
second was in Warsaw and dealt with the EU's role in the world; the third
was in Frankfurt and focused on the value of investment flowing from the EU
budget back to member states.
The economy will be discussed on February 20
in Madrid in the last conference. It has been no surprise that all the ReACT
events have been scripted to promote collective EU "solutions" to all the
real or perceived problems and "crises."
And these solutions always entail
the transfer of more power to the EU central authorities.
Another row last year erupted over the vote by
the European Parliament for 7.3 million to fund a three-day "summer camp"
next May (just before the elections) for 10,000 young people aged 16 to 30
to celebrate Europe's "cultural diversity" and debate "ideas for a better
Europe."
None of this is new, of course; the pro-EU
propaganda has been flowing non-stop, and in ever-grander and more militant
fashion, for decades.
However, in those earlier years, most people were
blinded by the free cheese, but now the mousetraps are snapping shut, with
lethal effect. The EU propaganda is ubiquitous, with EU flags and EU symbols
everywhere, and new EU agencies and buildings cropping up daily.
Then there
are the pro-EU school lessons and textbooks, comic books, radio and TV
broadcasts, billboards, bus and subway advertisements, etc.
However, as we have reported here previously,
support for the EU is crumbling throughout Euroland, and even all the
aggressive propaganda Brussels can muster may not be enough to save it from
breaking apart.
In fact, Reding, Barroso, and company appear to be
alienating and angering far more people with their offensive, ham-fisted
approach than they are winning to the EU cause.
