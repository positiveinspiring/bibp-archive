This is not the first time training exercises
were carried out on the same day attacks
happened.
Research all the examples provided.
1. The shooting incident at Denver's Aurora
movie theater was paralleled as a training exercise in a medical school on
the same day
On 20 July 2012, students, at the Rocky Vista
University College of Osteopathic Medicine, were being trained to respond to
the scenario where a shooter fires at people in a movie theater and also
uses a bomb in the attack.
"The irony is amazing, just amazing," said
Rocky Vista Dean Dr. Bruce Dubin.
Emergency specialist physicians from Dallas, as
well as from several other emergency programs around the country, are
teaching the 'Advanced Disaster Life Support Training'.
2. Just hours before the Norway attacks,
the Norwegian government was carrying out a simulation exercise similar to
the actual attacks
Norway drill just before
the attack.
Norwegian Police Confirm Drill Identical to Breivik's Attack.
Aftenposten
reports:
Police sources have confirmed that, hours
before the attack on Ut√∏ya island, police had conducted a drill for a
'practically identical scenario.'
3. Webster Tarpley, the historian, has
listed the "names of the military exercises and hijack drills that were
actually taking place on the morning of September 11"
"Fake radar blips, dummy hijacks, dummy
attacks, fighter jets sent off to Turkey, the skies left unprotected,
with the FBI's top anti-terror experts stuck on a training exercise in
California.
"The drills, said Tarpley, were important, because not only did they
weaken and confuse US air defence, but there was also a military drill
for each major component of the 9/11 attacks.
"The drills were cover, and the dummy threats were made real."

4. A few hours before the Madrid Bombings,
NATO carried out a terrorism exercise in Madrid
Former Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, described it
as a "coincidence" that, on 4 March 2004, there was an anti-terrorist
exercise (CMX-04) in Madrid, finishing just a few hours before the bombings.
The NATO counterterrorism exercise involved an imagined attack which would
kill 200 people.
This number is very close to the number of fatalities that occurred in the
actual Madrid Bombings.

5. The 7 July 2005 London Tube Bombings
occurred the same day as a government terror exercise
On the same day of the London bombings
Peter Power (above image) gave interviews on BBC Radio 5 Live and
ITV saying that he was involved in an exercise,
"based on simultaneous bombs going off
precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning".
He also gave an interview to the Manchester
Evening News where he spoke of,
"an exercise involving mock broadcasts when
it happened for real".
