to Facebook
I despise Facebook. This enormously successful
American business describes itself as "a social utility that connects you
with the people around you".
But hang on. Why on God's earth would I need a
computer to connect with the people around me? Why should my relationships
be mediated through the imagination of a bunch of supergeeks in California?
What was wrong with the pub?
And does Facebook really connect people?
Doesn't it rather disconnect us, since instead
of doing something enjoyable such as talking and eating and dancing and
drinking with my friends, I am merely sending them little ungrammatical
notes and amusing photos in cyberspace, while chained to my desk? A friend
of mine recently told me that he had spent a Saturday night at home alone on
Facebook, drinking at his desk.
What a gloomy image. Far from connecting us,
Facebook actually isolates us at our workstations.
Facebook appeals to a kind of vanity and self-importance in us, too. If I
put up a flattering picture of myself with a list of my favourite things, I
can construct an artificial representation of who I am in order to get sex
or approval. ("I like Facebook," said another friend. "I got a shag out of
it.")
It also encourages a disturbing competitiveness
around friendship: it seems that with friends today, quality counts for
nothing and quantity is king. The more friends you have, the better you
are. You are "popular", in the sense much loved in American high
schools.
Witness the cover line on Dennis Publishing's
new Facebook magazine:
"How To Double Your Friends List."
It seems, though, that I am very much alone in
my hostility.
At the time of writing Facebook claims 59
million active users, including 7 million in the UK, Facebook's
third-biggest customer after the US and Canada. That's 59 million suckers,
all of whom have volunteered their ID card information and consumer
preferences to an American business they know nothing about.
Right now, 2 million new people join each week.
At the present rate of growth, Facebook will have more than 200 million
active users by this time next year. And I would predict that, if anything,
its rate of growth will accelerate over the coming months.
As its spokesman Chris Hughes says:
"It's embedded itself to an extent where
it's hard to get rid of."
All of the above would have been enough to make
me reject Facebook for ever. But there are more reasons to hate it. Many
more.
Facebook is a well-funded project, and the
people behind the funding, a group of Silicon Valley venture capitalists,
have a clearly thought out ideology that they are hoping to spread around
the world.
Facebook is one manifestation of this
ideology. Like PayPal before it, it is a social experiment, an
expression of a particular kind of neoconservative libertarianism. On
Facebook, you can be free to be who you want to be, as long as you don't
mind being bombarded by adverts for the world's biggest brands. As with
PayPal, national boundaries are a thing of the past.
Although the project was initially conceived by media cover star Mark Zuckerberg, the real face behind Facebook is the 40-year-old Silicon Valley
venture capitalist and futurist philosopher Peter Thiel.
There are only three board members on Facebook,
and they are Thiel, Zuckerberg and a third investor called Jim Breyer from a
venture capital firm called
Accel Partners (more on him later). Thiel
invested $500,000 in Facebook when Harvard students Zuckerberg, Chris Hughes
and Dustin Moskowitz went to meet him in San Francisco in June 2004, soon
after they had launched the site.
Thiel now reportedly owns 7% of Facebook, which,
at Facebook's current valuation of $15bn, would be worth more than $1bn.
There is much debate on who exactly were the original co-founders of
Facebook, but whoever they were, Zuckerberg is the only one left on the
board, although Hughes and Moskowitz still work for the company.
Thiel is widely regarded in Silicon Valley and in the US venture capital
scene as a libertarian genius. He is the co-founder and CEO of the virtual
banking system PayPal, which he sold to Ebay for $1.5bn, taking $55m for
himself. He also runs a £3bn hedge fund called Clarium Capital Management
and a venture capital fund called Founders Fund.
Bloomberg Markets magazine recently called him
"one of the most successful hedge fund managers in the country".
He has made money by betting on rising oil
prices and by correctly predicting that the dollar would weaken. He and his
absurdly wealthy Silicon Valley mates have recently been labelled "The
PayPal Mafia" by Fortune magazine, whose reporter also observed that Thiel
has a uniformed butler and a $500,000 McLaren supercar. Thiel is also a
chess master and intensely competitive. He has been known to sweep the
chessmen off the table in a fury when losing.
And he does not apologize for this hyper-competitveness,
saying:
"Show me a good loser and I'll show you a
loser."
But Thiel is more than just a clever and
avaricious capitalist. He is a futurist philosopher and neocon activist.
A philosophy graduate from Stanford, in 1998 he
co-wrote a book called The Diversity Myth, which is a detailed attack on
liberalism and the multiculturalist ideology that dominated Stanford. He
claimed that the "multiculture" led to a lessening of individual freedoms.
While a student at Stanford, Thiel founded a rightwing journal, still up and
running, called The Stanford Review - motto: Fiat Lux ("Let there be
light").
Thiel is a member of
TheVanguard.Org, an
internet-based neoconservative pressure group that was set up to attack
MoveOn.org, a liberal pressure group that works on the web. Thiel calls
himself "way libertarian".
TheVanguard is run by one Rod D Martin, a philosopher-capitalist whom Thiel
greatly admires.
On the site, Thiel says:
"Rod is one of our nation's leading minds in
the creation of new and needed ideas for public policy. He possesses a
more complete understanding of America than most executives have of
their own businesses."
This little taster from their website will give
you an idea of their vision for the world:
"TheVanguard.Org is an online community of
Americans who believe in conservative values, the free market and
limited government as the best means to bring hope and ever-increasing
opportunity to everyone, especially the poorest among us."
Their aim is to promote policies that will
"reshape America and the globe". TheVanguard describes its politics as "Reaganite/Thatcherite".
The chairman's message says:
"Today we'll teach MoveOn [the liberal
website], Hillary and the leftwing media some lessons they never
imagined."
So, Thiel's politics are not in doubt. What
about his philosophy?
I listened to a podcast of an address Thiel gave about
his ideas for the future. His philosophy, briefly, is this: since the 17th
century, certain enlightened thinkers have been taking the world away from
the old-fashioned nature-bound life, and here he quotes Thomas Hobbes'
famous characterization of life as "nasty, brutish and short", and towards a
new virtual world where we have conquered nature.
Value now exists in imaginary things.
Thiel says that PayPal was motivated by this
belief: that you can find value not in real manufactured objects, but in the
relations between human beings. PayPal was a way of moving money around the
world with no restriction.
Bloomberg Markets puts it like this:
"For Thiel,
PayPal was all about freedom: it would enable people to skirt currency
controls and move money around the globe."
Clearly, Facebook is another uber-capitalist experiment: can you make money
out of friendship? Can you create communities free of national boundaries -
and then sell Coca-Cola to them?
Facebook is profoundly uncreative. It makes
nothing at all.
It simply mediates in relationships that were happening
anyway.

Thiel's philosophical mentor is one René Girard
of Stanford University, proponent of a theory of human behavior called
mimetic desire.
Girard reckons that people are essentially
sheep-like and will copy one another without much reflection. The theory
would also seem to be proved correct in the case of Thiel's virtual worlds:
the desired object is irrelevant; all you need to know is that human beings
will tend to move in flocks. Hence financial bubbles. Hence the enormous popularity of Facebook.
Girard is a regular at Thiel's intellectual soirees. What you don't hear
about in Thiel's philosophy, by the way, are old-fashioned real-world
concepts such as art, beauty, love, pleasure and truth.
The internet is immensely appealing to neocons such as Thiel because it
promises a certain sort of freedom in human relations and in business,
freedom from pesky national laws, national boundaries and suchlike. The
internet opens up a world of free trade and laissez-faire expansion. Thiel
also seems to approve of offshore tax havens, and claims that 40% of the
world's wealth resides in places such as Vanuatu, the Cayman Islands, Monaco
and Barbados.
I think it's fair to say that Thiel, like
Rupert
Murdoch, is against tax.
He also likes the
globalization of digital culture
because it makes the banking overlords hard to attack:
"You can't have a workers' revolution to
take over a bank if the bank is in Vanuatu," he says.
If life in the past was nasty, brutish and
short, then in the future Thiel wants to make it much longer, and to this
end he has also invested in a firm that is exploring life-extension
technologies.
He has pledged £3.5m to a Cambridge-based
gerontologist called Aubrey de Grey, who is searching for the key to
immortality. Thiel is also on the board of advisers of something called the
Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
From its fantastical website, the following:
"The Singularity is the technological
creation of smarter-than-human intelligence. There are several
technologies... heading in this direction... Artificial Intelligence... direct brain-computer interfaces... genetic engineering...
different technologies which, if they reached a threshold level of
sophistication, would enable the creation of smarter-than-human
intelligence."
So by his own admission, Thiel is trying to
destroy the real world, which he also calls "nature", and install a virtual
world in its place, and it is in this context that we must view the rise of
Facebook.
Facebook is a deliberate experiment in global manipulation, and Thiel is a bright young thing in the neoconservative pantheon, with a
penchant for far-out techno-utopian fantasies. Not someone I want to help get any richer.
The third board member of Facebook is Jim Breyer.
He is a partner in the
venture capital firm Accel Partners, who put $12.7m into Facebook in April
2005. On the board of such US giants as Wal-Mart and Marvel Entertainment,
he is also a former chairman of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA).
Now these are the people who are really making things happen in America,
because they invest in the new young talent, the Zuckerbergs and the like.
Facebook's most recent round of funding was led
by a company called Greylock Venture Capital, who put in the sum of $27.5m.
One of Greylock's senior partners is called
Howard Cox, another former chairman of the NVCA, who is also on the board of
In-Q-Tel. What's In-Q-Tel? Well, believe it or not (and check out their
website),
this is the venture-capital wing of the CIA.
After
9/11, the US intelligence community became
so excited by the possibilities of new technology and the innovations being
made in the private sector, that in 1999 they set up their own venture
capital fund, In-Q-Tel, which,
"identifies and partners with companies
developing cutting-edge technologies to help deliver these solutions to
the Central Intelligence Agency and the broader US Intelligence
Community (IC) to further their missions".
The US defense department and the CIA love
technology because it makes spying easier.
"We need to find new ways to deter new
adversaries," defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld said in 2003. "We need
to make the leap into the information age, which is the critical
foundation of our transformation efforts."
In-Q-Tel's first chairman was Gilman Louie, who
served on the board of the NVCA with Breyer. Another key figure in the
In-Q-Tel team is Anita K Jones, former director of defense research and
engineering for the US department of defense, and - with Breyer - board
member of BBN Technologies.
When she left the US department of defense,
Senator Chuck Robb paid her the following tribute:
"She brought the technology and operational
military communities together to design detailed plans to sustain US
dominance on the battlefield into the next century."
Now even if you don't buy the idea that Facebook
is some kind of extension of the American imperialist program crossed with a
massive information-gathering tool, there is no way of denying that as a
business, it is pure mega-genius.
Some net nerds have suggested that its $15bn
valuation is excessive, but I would argue that if anything that is too
modest.
Its scale really is dizzying, and the potential for growth is
virtually limitless.
"We want everyone to be able to use Facebook,"
says the impersonal voice of Big Brother on the website.
I'll bet they do.
It is Facebook's enormous
potential that led Microsoft to buy 1.6% for $240m. A recent rumor says that
Asian investor Lee Ka-Shing, said to be the ninth richest man in the world,
has bought 0.4% of Facebook for $60m.
The creators of the site need do very little bar fiddle with the program. In
the main, they simply sit back and watch as millions of Facebook addicts
voluntarily upload their ID details, photographs and lists of their favorite
consumer objects.
Once in receipt of this vast database of human
beings, Facebook then simply has to sell the information back to
advertisers, or, as Zuckerberg puts it in a recent blog post,
"to try to help people share information
with their friends about things they do on the web".
And indeed, this is precisely what's happening.
On November 6 last year, Facebook announced that 12 global brands had
climbed on board. They included Coca-Cola, Blockbuster, Verizon, Sony
Pictures and Condé Nast.
All trained in marketing bullshit of the highest
order, their representatives made excited comments along the following
lines:
"With Facebook Ads, our brands can become a
part of the way users communicate and interact on Facebook," said Carol
Kruse, vice president, global interactive marketing, the Coca-Cola
Company.
"We view this as an innovative way to cultivate relationships with
millions of Facebook users by enabling them to interact with Blockbuster
in convenient, relevant and entertaining ways," said Jim Keyes,
Blockbuster chairman and CEO.
"This is beyond creating advertising
impressions. This is about Blockbuster participating in the community of
the consumer so that, in return, consumers feel motivated to share the
benefits of our brand with their friends."
"Share" is Facebook-speak for "advertise".
Sign up to Facebook and you become a free
walking, talking advert for Blockbuster or Coke, extolling the virtues of
these brands to your friends. We are seeing the commodification of
human relationships, the extraction of capitalistic value from friendships.
Now, by comparison with Facebook, newspapers, for example, begin to look
hopelessly outdated as a business model. A newspaper sells advertising space
to businesses looking to sell stuff to their readers. But the system is far
less sophisticated than Facebook for two reasons. One is that newspapers
have to put up with the irksome expense of paying journalists to provide the
content. Facebook gets its content for free.
The other is that Facebook can target
advertising with far greater precision than a newspaper.
Admit on Facebook that your favorite film is
This Is Spinal Tap, and when a Spinal Tap-esque movie comes out, you can
be sure that they'll be sending ads your way.

It's true that Facebook recently got into hot
water with its Beacon advertising program.
Users were notified that one of their friends
had made a purchase at certain online shops; 46,000 users felt that this
level of advertising was intrusive, and signed a petition called "Facebook!
Stop invading my privacy!" to say so.
Zuckerberg apologized on his company
blog. He has written that they have now changed the system from "opt-out" to
"opt-in".
But I suspect that this little rebellion about
being so ruthlessly commodified will soon be forgotten: after all,
there was a national outcry by the civil liberties movement when the idea of
a police force was mooted in the UK in the mid 19th century.
Furthermore, have you Facebook users ever actually read the privacy policy?
It tells you that you don't have much privacy.
Facebook pretends to be about
freedom, but isn't it really more like an ideologically motivated virtual
totalitarian regime with a population that will very soon exceed the UK's?
Thiel and the rest have created their own country, a country of consumers.
Now, you may, like Thiel and the other new masters of the cyberverse, find
this social experiment tremendously exciting. Here at last is the
Enlightenment state longed for since the Puritans of the 17th century sailed
away to North America, a world where everyone is free to express themselves
as they please, according to who is watching.
National boundaries are a thing of the past and
everyone cavorts together in freewheeling virtual space. Nature has been
conquered through man's boundless ingenuity. Yes, and you may decide to send
genius investor Thiel all your money, and certainly you'll be waiting
impatiently for the public flotation of the unstoppable Facebook.
Or you might reflect that you don't really want to be part of this
heavily-funded program to create an arid global virtual republic, where your
own self and your relationships with your friends are converted into
commodities on sale to giant global brands. You may decide that you don't
want to be part of this takeover bid for the world.
For my own part, I am going to retreat from the whole thing, remain as
unplugged as possible, and spend the time I save by not going on Facebook
doing something useful, such as reading books. Why would I want to waste my
time on Facebook when I still haven't read Keats' Endymion? And when there
are seeds to be sown in my own back yard? I don't want to retreat from
nature, I want to reconnect with it. Damn air-conditioning! And if I want to
connect with the people around me, I will revert to an old piece of
technology.
It's free, it's easy and it delivers a uniquely
individual experience in sharing information: it's called talking.
