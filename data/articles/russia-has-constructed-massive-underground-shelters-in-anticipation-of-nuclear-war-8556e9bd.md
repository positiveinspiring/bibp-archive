# Russia has Constructed Massive Underground Shelters in Anticipation of 
Nuclear War

Did you know that the Russians have
a massive underground complex in the Ural mountains that has
been estimated to be approximately
400 square miles
in size?
In other words,
it is roughly as big as the
area inside the Washington D.C. beltway.
Back in the
1990s, the
Clinton administration was deeply concerned about the
construction of this enormous complex deep inside
Yamantau
mountain, but they could never seem to get any straight answers
from the Russians.
The command center for this complex
is rumored to be 3,000 feet directly straight down from the
summit of this giant rock quartz mountain. And of course U.S.
military officials will admit that there are dozens of other
similar sites throughout Russia, although most of them are
thought to be quite a bit smaller.
But that is not all that the
Russians have been up to.
For example, Russian television has
reported that 5,000 new emergency nuclear bomb shelters were
scheduled to have been completed in the city of Moscow alone by
the end of 2012. Most Americans don't realize this, but the
Russians have never stopped making preparations for nuclear war.
Meanwhile, the U.S. government has
essentially done nothing to prepare our citizens for an attack.
The assumption seems to be that a nuclear attack will probably
never happen, and that if it does it will probably mean the end
of our civilization anyway.
Needless to say, the Russians are
very secretive about their massive underground facility at
Yamantau mountain, and no American has ever been inside.
The following is what Wikipedia
has to say about it
Large excavation projects have
been observed by U.S. satellite imagery as recently as the
late 1990s, during the time of Boris Yeltsin's government
after the fall of the Soviet Union.
Two garrisons, Beloretsk-15 and
Beloretsk-16, were built on top of the facility, and
possibly a third, Alkino-2, as well, and became the closed
town of Mezhgorye in 1995. They are said to house 30,000
workers each.
Repeated U.S. questions have
yielded several different responses from the Russian
government regarding Mount Yamantaw. They have said it is a
mining site, a repository for Russian treasures, a food
storage area, and a bunker for leaders in case of nuclear
war.
Responding to questions
regarding Yamantaw in 1996, Russia's Defense Ministry
stated:
"The practice does not exist
in the Defense Ministry of Russia of informing foreign
mass media about facilities, whatever they are, that are
under construction in the interests of strengthening the
security of Russia."
Large rail lines serve the
facility.
Back in 1996,
the New York Times reported on the continuing construction
of this site.
U.S. officials were quite puzzled
that the Russians were continuing to build it even though the
Cold War was supposedly over at that point
In a secret project reminiscent
of the chilliest days of the cold war, Russia is building a
mammoth underground military complex in the Ural Mountains,
Western officials and Russian witnesses say.
Hidden inside Yamantau mountain
in the Beloretsk area of the southern Urals, the project
involves the construction of a huge complex served by a
railroad, a highway and thousands of workers.
Within the U.S. intelligence
community, there was a tremendous amount of debate at that time
regarding the purposes of this facility, but what everyone
agreed on was that it was going to be absolutely massive
A report in Sovetskaya Rossiya
said the project involves construction of a railroad, a
modern highway and towns for tens of thousands of workers
and their families.
"The complex is as
big as the Washington area inside the Beltway,"
said an American official familiar with intelligence
reports.
A couple of years later, a top U.S.
general
said that he believed that the complex at Yamantau had,
"millions of square feet
available for underground facilities"...
In 1998, in a rare public
comment, then-Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM)
Gen. Eugene Habinger, called Yamantau,
"a very large complex -
we estimate that it has millions of square feet
available for underground facilities. We don't have
a clue as to what they're doing there."
It is believed to be large
enough to house 60,000 persons, with a special air
filtration system designed to withstand a nuclear,
chemical or biological attack.
Enough food and water is
believed to be stored at the site to sustain the entire
underground population for months on end.
A few years after that, in 2003,
there was an article in the Washington Post
by Bruce G. Blair in which Yamantau was mentioned as a
potential key target for U.S. nuclear war planners
Die-hard [U.S.] nuclear war
planners actually have their eyes on targets in Russia and
China, including missile silos and leadership bunkers.
For these planners, the Cold War
never ended. Their top two candidates [i.e., targets] in
Russia are located inside the Yamantau and Kosvinsky
mountains in the central and southern Urals.
Both were huge construction
projects begun in the late 1970s, when U.S. nuclear
firepower took special aim at the Communist Party's
leadership complex.
Fearing a decapitating strike,
the Soviets sent tens of thousands of workers to these
remote sites, where U.S. spy satellites spotted them still
toiling away in the late 1990s.
But the Russians have not just been
building giant underground facilities deep in the Urals.
They have also been constructing
thousands of new underground bomb shelters in
major cities such as Moscow.
The following is an excerpt from an RT
article in 2010
Nearly 5,000 new
emergency bomb shelters will be built in Moscow by 2012
to save people in case of potential attacks.
Moscow authorities say the
measure is urgent as the shelters currently available in the
city can house no more that half of its population.
In the last 20 years, the area
of air-raid defense has been developed little, and the
existing shelters have become outdated.
Moreover, they are located
mostly in the city center, which makes densely
populated Moscow outskirts especially vulnerable in the
event of a nuclear attack.
In order to resolve the issue,
the city has given architects a task to construct a typical
model of an easy-to-build shelter that will be located all
over the city 10 to 15 meters underneath apartment blocks,
shopping centers, sport complexes and parks, as in case of
attack people will need to reach the shelters within a
minute.
Of course all of this construction
cost the Russians a lot of money.
One estimate put the cost at "anywhere
from half a billion to a billion dollars"...
Though the bunkers are supposed
to be designed to shelter the population in the event of a
nuclear attack, government officials say it's only a
precaution and they do not expect such an attack or nuclear
outbreak (e.g. Chernobyl) to occur.
Neither RT or the
Russian government provided estimates for the cost of the
facilities.
A
Popular Mechanics article that reviewed a number of
different types of bunkers and building practices had
varying prices depending on the type of shelter.
Since the proposed Russian
bunkers would hold roughly 1000 people each (based on the
population count and other details), one could estimate that
the lowest price point for a bunker this size, with basic
necessities like bathrooms and reserve food for a day or
two, may run in the area of around $100,000-$200,000.
This would put a conservative
price tag for 5000 shelters anywhere from half a billion to
a billion dollars.
A significant investment,
indeed.
So what about us?
Has the U.S. government constructed
any bunkers for the survival of the general population in the
United States?
Of course not. In the event of a
nuclear war, I guess they just expect pretty much all of us to
die.
The Russians also recently finished
work on a brand new national defense center in Moscow that
contains extensive
underground facilities
Russia is launching a new
national defense facility, which is meant to monitor threats
to national security in peacetime, but would take control of
the entire country in case of war.
The new top-security, fortified
facility in Moscow includes several large war rooms, a brand
new supercomputer in the heart of a state-of-the-art data
processing center, underground facilities, secret transport
routes for emergency evacuation and a helicopter pad, which
was deployed for the first time on Nov. 24 on the Moscow
River.
The Defense Ministry won't disclose the price tag for
the site, but it is estimated at the equivalent of several
billion dollars.
In addition, the Russians have also
been developing a new anti-ballistic missile system that is
designed to keep U.S. nuclear missiles from getting to their
targets in the first place.
The U.S. doesn't have anything like
the S-500 that is currently being developed by the Russians. At
the latest, it is scheduled to be deployed in 2017, but there
are rumors that it is already starting to be deployed today.
The following comes from
military-today.com
The S-500 is not an upgrade of
the S-400, but a new design. It uses a lot of new technology
and is superior to the S-400.
It was designed to
intercept ballistic missiles. It is planned to have a range
of 500-600 km and hit targets at altitudes as high as 40 km.
Some sources claim that this system is capable of tracking
5-20 ballistic targets and intercepting up to 5-10 ballistic
targets simultaneously. It can defeat ballistic missiles
traveling at 5-7 kilometers per second.
It has been reported
that this air defense system can also target low orbital
satellites. It is planned that the S-500 will
shield Moscow and the regions around it. It will replace the
current A-135 anti-ballistic missile system.
The S-500 missiles will
be used only against the most important targets, such as
intercontinental ballistic missiles, AWACS and
jamming aircraft.
Sadly, most Americans are not
interested in this stuff at all.
These days, most Americans just
assume that the Russians are "our friends" and that a war with
Russia could never possibly happen.
What they don't realize is that the
Russian people see things very, very differently.
Today,
81 percent of Russians have a negative opinion of the United
States. Our interference in the conflict in Ukraine has made the
Russian people very angry, and there are many over there that
now believe that a shooting war with the United States is
inevitable.
And this week things between the
United States and Russia got even more tense.
Barack Obama has
already announced that we will be sending "non-lethal" military
aid to the Ukrainians, but now the U.S. House of Representatives
has overwhelmingly passed a resolution that calls for Obama
to send "lethal" military aid to the government in Kiev
Yesterday, in a vote that
largely slid under the radar, the House of Representatives
passed a resolution urging Obama to send lethal aid to
Ukraine, providing offensive, not just "defensive" weapons
to the Ukraine army - the same insolvent, hyperinflating
Ukraine which, with a
Caa3/CC credit rating, last week started
preparations to issue sovereign debt with a US
guarantee, in essence making it a part of the United States
(something the US previously did as a favor to Egypt before
the Muslim Brotherhood puppet regime was swept from power by
the local army).
The resolution passed with broad
bipartisan support by a count of 348 to 48.
According to DW,
the measure urges Obama to provide Ukraine with,
"lethal
defensive weapon systems" that would better enable Ukraine
to defend its territory from "the unprovoked and continuing
aggression of the Russian Federation."
"Policy like this should not be
partisan," said House Democrat Eliot Engel, the lead sponsor
of the resolution. "That is why we are rising today as
Democrats and Republicans, really as Americans, to say
enough is enough in Ukraine."
If Obama does decide to send lethal
military aid to the Ukrainians, the Russians are going to flip
out.
Sadly, neither side seems very
interested in peace at this point.
We just continue to take even more
steps along the road toward World War III, and it is a war that
the United States is completely and utterly unprepared for.
