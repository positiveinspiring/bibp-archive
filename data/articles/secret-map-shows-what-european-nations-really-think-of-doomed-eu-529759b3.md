EUROPE is turning against Brussels
with anti-EU feeling spreading through the Continent
- as our exclusive map reveals. European Union Technocracy
taking Major Heat from Member Nations
Who say It is 'Doomed' The EU is thoroughly embedded with Technocracy
in that it is completely run by unelected and unaccountable technocrats.
Member states are getting fed up with the arrangement
and view the EU as on its last legs.
The outcome will be interesting to watch,
because if the EU falls apart, it will be a major blow to Technocrats everywhere
that their crackpot schemes are not acceptable.
Strong anti-Brussels feelings
are soaring in 25 out of 28 member countries
Optimism about the EU's future has plummeted in all but three of the 28 member states, most strikingly in the Netherlands and Germany, where people are now overwhelmingly negative about the outlook for the union. According to the latest figures from the EU's own Eurobarometer survey, the scale of optimism is,
Lowest in Greece, where just 34 per cent are upbeat about the future of the EU, compared with 63 per cent who are pessimistic. In Cyprus fewer than four in 10-37 per cent - are positive about the EU's prospects, compared with 58 per cent who are negative. In Austria 37 per cent are optimistic, compared with 56 per cent who are pessimistic. In the UK, the figures are 46 per cent optimistic and 44 per cent pessimistic. Germany has seen the biggest fall in the number of people who are optimistic about the future, with a 14 per cent drop since spring last year. Conversely, optimism is highest in Ireland and among the eastern European countries, with 73 per cent in Romania and 70 per cent in Poland saying they are positive about the future of the EU. The bi-annual survey conducted by the European Commission gauges public opinion across all member states. It was carried out between November 7 and 17 last year when the refugee crisis was getting worse. Migration is considered to be the most fundamental issue the EU must deal with.

EU-EXPRESS Optimism about the EU's future
has plummeted in all but three of the 28 member states
It is mentioned by 58 per cent of those questioned - a 20 per cent increase since spring 2015. The majority of the population in 25 of the 28 member states have a negative feeling about immigration of people from outside the EU. Around nine in 10 Europeans said additional measures should be taken to fight illegal immigration. Last night Arron Banks, founder of Leave.EU, said:
"It is no surprise that the rest of Europe has finally woken-up to the fact that the EU is a failed project. It is now clear there is a rising tide of Euroskeptic discontent across the entire Continent. "As usual Britain is leading the way and taking decisive action by holding a referendum which will liberate us from this overbearing, archaic, expensive, bureaucratic institution."

Pros and cons of Brexit
The Netherlands is looking to follow in Britain's footsteps by holding its own referendum. A Dutch opinion poll last week revealed 53 per cent want an in-out vote with 44 per cent opposed and the rest unsure.

Pollster Maurice de Hond also asked people how they would vote in a referendum. His results showed the remain and leave groups are very close with 44 per cent saying they would vote to stay compared with 43 per cent voting to leave.
Member states also feel the image of the EU is suffering as the union struggles to survive.
Its image has lost ground in 24 of the 28 member states since spring 2015, with Estonia and Germany seeing the sharpest fall. In Germany, there was an 11-point drop in the number of people saying they had a positive image of the EU. The EU's image is neutral for a majority of the population in 15 countries, up from 10 in spring 2015, and negative in Cyprus and Austria. The countries where people are most likely to have a positive image of the EU are, Romania (57 per cent) Poland (55) Ireland (54) Lithuania (53) Croatia (51) Trust in the EU has also plunged by eight points since spring 2015.

Farage said the G20 announcement
was 'no surprise' because it was 'mates helping each other out'
Meanwhile, the proportion of European citizens who "tend not to trust" the EU has risen by nine per cent to 55 per cent. The proportion of Europeans who agree that their voice counts in the EU has also fallen by three points to 39 per cent. Last night in Ireland, which has suffered years of EU-imposed austerity, there were signs that the mood against the status quo was shifting. Exit polls in its general election pointed to voters turning against established parties, prompting fears of a second election.
David Cameron was in Northern Ireland yesterday as he continued a tour of the UK setting out the case for staying in the EU. The Prime Minister said the country's economy and farming industry were too closely linked to the EU to risk the "leap in the dark" of voting to quit.

Finance ministers from the world's leading economies also urged Britain not to turn its back on the EU following a G20 meeting in China. Chancellor George Osborne said:
"Here at the G20, finance leaders and central bank governors of the world's biggest economies have raised serious concerns about the risks posed by a UK exit from the EU. "They have concluded unanimously that what they call the shock of a potential UK vote to leave is among the biggest economic dangers this year. If that's their assessment of the impact on the world economy, imagine what it would do to the UK. "This isn't some amusing adventure into the unknown. A British exit would hurt people's jobs, livelihoods and living standards. It's deadly serious. It's my responsibility as Chancellor to make it clear to people what the economic risks are and that we are stronger, safer and better off remaining in a reformed EU."

Ukip's Nigel Farage said the G20 announcement was,
"no surprise" because it was "mates helping each other out".
He added:
"I'm not surprised that big government gets together to support David Cameron. "This is big banks, big business, big government all scratching each other's backs. I don't think that impresses voters."
