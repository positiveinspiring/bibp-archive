The pursuit for dominance is the primary propellant of history, always has
been, always will be.
Those who don't identify this assumption are not
excused in the grand chess game, but instead are displaced and exploited by
forces they do not comprehend.
From the aspect of
those who rule the board it is unmistakably desirable to
have a populace of unaware pawns than it is to have a bunch of adversaries
which can escalate an effective battle.
To that end it has always been
preferable for the rulers to build up illusions which conceal the true
nature of the game.
Walter Lippmann explained the "manufacture
of consent" as an innovation in the usage of democracy.
Basically it's a method of domination, and he
said this was beneficial and essential because the prevailing interests, the
accepted concerns of the population elude the public. Lippmann wasn't
theorizing, nor was he explaining anomaly that he had observed from far
away, he was part of that particular class and he directly affected the
evolution of this new method of control.
So what was this new method that Lippmann was alluding to? The answer to that inquiry takes us back to the
dawn of World War I.
In 1917 Woodrow Wilson assembled the
Committee on Public Information, also known as the CPI. It was a
disinformation bureau and its goal was to boost war approval among the
American people.
The CPI, controlled by a man named George
Creel, was known for its vulgar approach, blatant overstatements and
outright deceptions.
However one representative of the CPI, Edward Bernays, had a much
more sophisticated approach.
Instead of using nonintellectual tactics Bernays analyzed the psychology of the American people, then according to
his scrutiny he conceived a campaign to advocate the idea that America's
function in the war was to:
"make the world safe for democracy."
