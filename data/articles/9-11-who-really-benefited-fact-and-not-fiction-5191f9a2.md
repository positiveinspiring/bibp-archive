# 9/11 - Who Really Benefited? - Fact and Not Fiction...

-
The New York Port Authority was having
difficulty renting out space in the Twin Towers. More importantly
there was a huge asbestos liability.
Surprisingly these Towers were
sold to a new owner Larry Silverstein just three months prior - who
managed to get an insurance contract for a big payout if any of the
Tower buildings got hit by an airplane.
This is a fact.
-
Our first international move was to bomb
Afghanistan under the assumption that people there were involved. So
the heroin industry of Afghanistan came back to life in a big way -
that is international and local drug cartels rediscovered a gold
mine of money supply.
Bin Laden and the Taliban, because of their
religious fanaticism, pretty much closed down the trade to a
trickle.
But after the bombing shake-up, people connected with the
heroin trade in Central Asia reaped billion dollars rewards -
including money-laundering groups of financiers - such as banksters,
etc. (And this is pretty much all the U.S. military/intelligence
has really accomplished - despite all the rhetoric and high-sounding
goals about exporting democracy.)
This is fact and not fiction.
-
Investors of profitable corporations
connected to the military industrial complex made a killing (pun
intended). Obviously war has been profitable for some industries for
eons as we are told by most war historians profits are an inevitable
consequence of war for merchants of death yet they say profit is
not the driving force behind war.
Think again.
For our American
culture, since at least the Vietnam War, it seems to have become the
driving force. (What else does America still manufacture?) Prior to
9/11 there was little in the way of war material inventories being
depleted. But soon after 9/11 this all changed. In fact some
corporate stocks immediately went up in value - as did some military
contracts.
Note as well that after the cold war both the Pentagon
and the Intelligence apparatus should have cut their budgets in
half. (But then no one would have been promoted and the Pentagon
would have lost some of its clout.) That did not happen. Rather the
budgets doubled in size.
How is that for 'financial austerity'?
This
is fact and not fiction.
-
Some powerful industry leaders and think
tank politicos believed it was necessary for certain companies to
control various strategic resources such as oil and gas. And not
surprisingly the very countries in which we declared a war against
terrorists are surprisingly the same countries that contain such
resources - especially in the Middle East.
Gas and oil reserves are coveted by every industrial civilization
and every military as a necessity. For example, there was a plan to
build an oil pipeline through Afghanistan and Pakistan to ship out
from the Indian ocean - requiring stable societies that dont
sabotage pipelines. Nevertheless despite things not going as planned
oil companies for whatever reason reaped huge profits.
Fact and not
fiction.
-
Advocates, such as Paul Bremer, for
extreme laissez faire economic policies, attempted to rewrite an
Iraqi constitution to promote a free market system of neo-liberal
economic principles to make it especially easy for foreign nations
to own Iraqs resources.
And if you do your research you will come
to learn that the U.S. did not have any gripes with Saddam Hussein
until he kicked oil companies out of Iraq because they wanted to
take the lions share of the profits. He nationalized oil.
This is
fact and not fiction.
-
Israel benefited by having one of their
neighboring enemies, namely Saddam Hussein and his standing army,
weakened and preoccupied. It is not a coincidence that advocates and
newspaper pundits most defensive about our invasion happen to be
strong advocates of Israels right-wing will.
Evidence clearly shows
that some Israeli supporters were part of the culture of deception
to take us to war with Iraq - as they are now working to take us to
war with Iran with a similar pattern of phony intelligence. Equally
it is a fact that whatever Middle East group harbors hostility
toward Israel is now considered terrorist in nature to Americans.
It
is a fact that
the Israeli lobby pushed hard for war with Iraq.
-
Right-wing politicos, especially
Christian and Judaic, who like to promote prejudice against anything
Muslim and Arab benefited. Since 9-11 there has been a constant
propaganda war against Muslims throughout Western countries. (This
is not to argue that Americans should not be wary of foreign
motives.)
But the fact is that those who do not wish Muslims to have
influence in this culture have clearly wages a major propaganda
campaign for Westerners to fear and distrust a huge segment of the
worlds population - as a cultural clash or clash of civilizations
like the medieval era of The Crusades.
This is to say that Israels
enemies have become our enemies as neocon propaganda campaign
harps on Islamo-fascism, Islamo-extremism, and Islamo-fanaticism.
Meanwhile this event is used to further persuade Americans Israel is
Americas natural ally and partner against the forces of evil.
(Yet rightwing Israelis too are not willing to separate Church and
State and so they discriminate against those not Jewish. Therefore
they too do not share our democratic values of equality for all
people - like many of the theocratic countries in the Middle East.)
This is opinion but it still reflects reality.
-
Politically motivated people with the
desire to use fear, namely terrorism, as an excuse to curtail and
destroy civil liberties and freedoms normally honored in democratic
countries.
We have become more a fascist state with Homeland
Security surveillance. This curtailment is similar to those who
continue to try to censor free speech - and make it more difficult
to have the right to associate via technologies such as the
Internet.
Such mentality has allowed spying on citizens by
privatized corporations not accountable to the tax paying public
who pay organizations to secretly spy and keep records on its own
citizenry.
Obama and his team have done
nothing to make real,
substantive changes, and in fact have reinforced this tyranny.
The
curtailment of our freedoms is fact and not fiction.
-
Some international political operatives
willing to take American bribe money in exchange to playing and
saying our tune have benefited, such as some political factions in
the Middle East who equally play they game with our tax dollars -
including journalists who will write and say whatever Uncle Sam
wants as long as there is a brick of one hundred dollar bills as
disappeared just like military contracts that did not get
performed - but were still played.
This could also include those
creating phony websites to spew messages or take credit for events
done by others.
-
People with a desire to destroy the
political strength and good will of the American people and
government. Our country is no longer looked upon as a positive
force for democracy.
Further our economy has been severely damaged
by corrupt forces willing to sacrifice real national security to
greedy and self-interested ends. We are seen as the rogue state by
too many. It doesnt seem to bother some profiting that America goes
broke invading foreign countries - irrespective of what the rest of
the world thinks - and what could be a long term disaster - if not a
World War 3. (It almost seems like a deliberate foil to destroy
military preparedness and to weaken our security.)
Furthermore,
those who believe in a two class system benefited because the wealth
investor class, including most of the Congress and Senate, are not
sending their kids to die - rather they rely on a volunteer military
of lower and middle class kids that cant find jobs or have few
prospects to go to school.
-
Along with this financial bust is a
drive to destroy liberal notions of any kind of welfare for the less
fortunate - save welfare for corrupt corporations. While it is true
that there is no free lunch (unless you live in the beltway) there
is also way too much scorn for people who are not super-rich as
deserving some kind of humanity.
