This is one of the most important trends you'll see
in 2012 and beyond:
Global supply lines are breaking down.
The just-in-time system of deliveries
on tap is deteriorating.
Have you noticed how often the products or parts
you need are backordered or delayed? That's what I'm talking about.
Try to order 3TB hard drives for data storage. You'll discover they're all
back-ordered. When you order items from Amazon.com that are shipped by third
party companies, they're often delayed due to sourcing problems. Even our
own NaturalNews Store has suffered from sourcing challenges, where customer
demand is much higher than the available supply, and the suppliers sometimes
can't get us products in a timely manner.
This issue is especially notable across the firearms industry, where record
firearm sales have pushed gun manufacturers way beyond their normal
capacities.
Not only was Black Friday the top day for gun sales in the
history of the USA, but I spoke with the owner of a local Austin gun shop
just a couple of days ago, and he told me that on the Thursday and Friday
before Christmas his shop was completely slammed with customers, and many of
the products they wanted were simply out of stock or unavailable.
Something is happening across the planet with all this:
Supply lines are
getting thin and starting to crack.
You've probably noticed it when you're
trying to buy car parts or appliance parts.
Even many service companies are
thinly staffed these days. How long does it take now to get a repair man for
your furnace? Or a plumber? Remember when it used to be same-day or next-day
service?
Now it's often 2-3 days (or even more) before somebody can fix the
problem, and even then, they often need parts that have to be ordered.
The complexity of
modern society is starting to rupture
All this is a worrisome sign to anyone who understands even a little bit
about the complexities of modern society.
Even to build something as simple
as a water bottle, a manufacturer must be able to depend on a very long and
highly complex chain of suppliers who individually specialize in metals,
plastics or o-ring manufacturing. Then there's the logo printing which
requires yet another supply chain of ink specialists and printing equipment.
While a stainless steel water bottle may seem simple, it's actually the
culmination of thousands of years of specialized knowledge, processes and
equipment.
Even manufacturing a pencil is a modern miracle. Try it yourself sometime
and you'll discover just how complex a pencil really is. You need sources of
metals, rubber, graphite, paint, wood, and all the specialized manufacturing
equipment and expertise that goes with it.
Why does this matter? Understand this hugely important point:
The more complex a society becomes, the more
the loss of efficiency in just one small area of service or
manufacturing ripples across the entire economy, magnifying its negative
impact.
You can't build a car, for example, without the
microchips manufactured in China.
Sure, you can put together the entire car
- minus the microchips - but all you have is a 3,000-pound piece of junk
sitting on the assembly line. Without the microchips, the car is useless,
and increasingly those microchips all come from China or Japan.
This is even
true across the military, where red alerts have been issued recently about
the strategic vulnerability of military gear that
relies on microchips from China.
Suppose the microchips you need happen to show up, but then you then have a
problem with rubber from Sri Lanka. Most Americans have absolutely no clue
how much rubber they need to survive in modern society. The average vehicle
contains over 500 pounds of rubber parts, all of which are 100% dependant on
international
rubber producers.
Without rubber, in fact, modern society grinds to a halt. It's one of the
most important strategic natural resources in the world, yet barely anyone
thinks about it. Without rubber, you would have no transportation (not even
bicycles). No trains, no trucks, no cars and no airplanes. A loss of rubber
would also hit medical supplies and agricultural equipment in a huge way.
Goodbye mechanized farming...
So even a tiny disruption in this crucial global resource could be
devastating to the global economy.
Rest assured, folks, that if you could
read all the secret military documents at the Pentagon, and you could find a
report on the world's "most important strategic resources," right underneath
OIL, you would find RUBBER. (And no, the synthetic stuff isn't a viable
replacement...)
The collapse ripple
The point is that a highly complex society has many points of failure that
individually impact the entire web of complexity.
-
Lose rubber and you've
lost your entire transportation sector.
-
Lose oil and much the same happens.
-
Lose your source of microchips and you have to revert back to pre-1980's
technology.
-
Lose your manufacturing base - which has already happened in
America - and you have no capability to start building the stuff you need in
your own country anymore.
In World War II, America turned its car factories into tank factories and
cranked out Armored Personnel Carriers, B-17 bombers, tracked vehicles and
Jeep transport vehicles.
Today, America's automobile manufacturing has been
gutted to the core. All the machine shops have been offshored to Asia. A new
generation of Americans has grown up with little or no knowledge of how to
actually build anything other than Legos.
The entire culture of innovative
machining and metals fabrication has been all but lost (not to mention
textiles).
What's behind these
supply line failures? Criminal banks
There's a reason why supply lines are getting dangerously thin in America:
Easy credit is disappearing.
The failure of
the global banking system is
causing a trickle-down effect of decreased capital across the business
sector. This, in turn, causes businesses to decrease their inventories and
wait for orders to come in before manufacturing anything. So instead of
excess supply sitting around, waiting to be delivered, more and more
companies are operating on a "you order first, and then we'll make it"
basis.
Capital is hard to come by for honest businesses, you see.
Sure, if you're a
criminal bankster like
Jon Corzine, scamming the taxpayers out of billions
(or trillions!) of dollars, you get free bailout money from the corrupt
criminal enablers known as "members of Congress."
But if you're an honest,
hardworking American trying to run an honest business supplying real goods
to business customers, you get royally screwed with high taxes, heavy
banking fees, and a routine denial of operating credit. So you scratch by,
doing the best you can with what you've got, even as the government is
eroding the value of
the Federal Reserve notes (dollars) you've worked so
hard to earn.
Everywhere across the economy, honest businesses are getting hammered while
the big money goes out to military contractors, weapons manufacturers,
anti-terrorism security companies and others who have the right buddies in
the right hallways in Washington.
An economy that used to be based on
manufacturing productivity and abundance is now based on false terrorism
driving what is essentially a war economy.
That war economy, by the way, is just a few short years away from total
default.
It's the oldest story in history:
-
Empire invades foreign nations,
empire conquers foreign nations, then the empire goes broke trying to pay
for its ever-expanding military to control those foreign nations.
-
Empire
collapses into the dark corners of history and becomes a lesson for the next
generation which will usually make the same mistake anyway, because humans
have a short memory and don't really understand what history means.
Do not fool yourself into thinking America isn't headed down this path right
now.
With
the coming banking failures, the currency devaluation and the
ever-expanding costs of running a false war (complete with home-grown false
flag terror attacks to keep everybody scared into blind obedience),
America's economy is headed for its own inevitable catastrophe, at which
point you can fully expect supply line disruptions to be frequent and
large-scale.
If you truly
understand complex societies, you will prepare now
For a while after the collapse, it will be impossible to buy many items,
including many food staples and possibly even fuel.
Those who do not prepare
for supply line disruptions will probably be weeded out of the human gene
pool, earning their own place in history as examples of a failed genetic
experiment that was ultimately incapable of adapting to a rapidly-changing
environment.
In nature, when the climate rapidly changes, the only animals that survive
are those with adaptive skills, mobility and backup resources (squirrels
store food for a reason).
In human society, when the mechanized production
climate of readily-available foods, goods and services suddenly disappears -
even for a short while - you will observe a sudden and shocking shift in the
human gene pool towards those who have the foresight to plan and prepare
rather than those who live day by day, partying, consuming, copulating and
laughing it up.
As usual, I urge you to be adaptive and be prepared. When the day
comes that you actually need this wisdom, it will be too late to try to
prepare.
This is a test of survival that must be won in advance.
Why does the U.S.
government stockpile food, medical supplies and weapons?
Remember:
The U.S. government stockpiles massive quantities of food,
weapons, ammunition, communications equipment and medical supplies. These
are held in huge underground storage facilities (caves) carved out of pure
granite.
Watch the video to see for yourself:
By the way, I have firsthand knowledge of these caves.
Being from Kansas
City, I used to drive by these caves quite frequently, witnessing 18-wheeler
rigs pulling in and out of these cave entrances, right off the highway. This
has been going on for decades.
They have
underground cities for the storage
of supplies. It's not a conspiracy theory, it's an admitted historical fact.
-
Ever wonder why the government bothers to do this?
-
For what purpose does the
government feel it needs to be prepared with years of supplies while, at the
same time, telling the American citizens they only need enough supplies to
last a few days?
That's not a flippant question.
If you answer it honestly, you will be ahead
of 99% of the rest of the population which now faces a precarious future in
a highly complex society that's already starting to tear apart at the seams.
