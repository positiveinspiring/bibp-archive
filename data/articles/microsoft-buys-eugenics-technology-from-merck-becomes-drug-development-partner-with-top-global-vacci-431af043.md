When you buy Microsoft products, you are now promoting the pharmaceutical
industry and its global vaccine agenda. That's the new reality in which we
live, where the world's largest software company is "in bed" with the
world's largest vaccine pusher.
How so? In 2009, Microsoft purchased a key piece of technology from the
drug
company Merck, the world's largest maker of vaccines (which
Bill Gates says
can help "reduce the global population" by 10 to 15 percent).
That technology, as you'll see below, can
conceivably be used to develop eugenics vaccines that target specific races
and nationalities with infertility-inducing pharmaceuticals - something that
is entirely consistent with Bill Gates' openly-admitted goal of reducing
world population through the use of vaccines (see link to video below).
This gene-targeting vaccine research technology purchased by Microsoft was
developed by the company known as Rosetta Biosciences, formerly owned by
Merck.
Their software
is described as a way to,
"figure out how genes interact with each
other, analyze peptides and metabolites, and determine how they relate
to gene expression."
An announcement on the Rosetta Biosoftware web
site
explains,
"The deal allows Microsoft to incorporate
genetic, genomic, metabolomic and proteomics data management software
into the Microsoft Amalga Life Sciences platform for enhanced
translational research capabilities."
This same announcement goes on to say that
vaccine maker Merck will "provide strategic input to Microsoft" as a part of
the deal. Merck's strategy, of course, is to make money by pimping vaccines
and pharmaceuticals, including the now-infamous
Gardasil vaccine.
Rupert Vessey, the vice president of Merck Research Laboratories,
openly admits this deal puts Microsoft in the role of being a drug
developer.
He says,
"We look forward to collaborating with
Microsoft to develop new bioinformatic solutions to enable and expedite
drug discovery and development..."
This is a key statement to understand, because
the term "bioinformatic" can only mean one thing.
What stores information in biology? These is
only one digital storage system in human biology, and that system is, of
course, DNA. Therefore, the idea of developing "bioinformatic solutions"
really means to develop "gene-targeting drugs and vaccines."
This is fully consistent with Bill Gates' admitted agenda of
reducing world
population with the help of drug company technologies.
At a TED conference,
he announced in front of a live audience:
"...if we do a really great job on new
vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower
[global population] by perhaps 10 or 15 percent."
See the video yourself:
All this comes on the heels of other recent news that Bill Gates is funding
sperm-destroying technology to
cause widespread male infertility.
His foundation
has also funded genetically
modified mosquitoes and other mad science experiments.
Microsoft the new
leader in eugenics technology?
What's clear from all this is that Bill Gates is pursuing an agenda of human
depopulation.
This is a similar agenda of those who pursue
eugenics efforts around the globe, including Adolf Hitler and a long list of
former FDA Commissioners in the United States. One of the most common
ambitions of those in the highest positions of power, it seems, is to cull
the human population and eliminate "the little people," leaving only a
"master race" of supreme beings.
Even major universities around the globe are now teaching students that
human beings are evil for merely being alive and exhaling carbon dioxide,
and that killing off humans is "green" for the planet.
In order to kill off large swaths of human beings, the most efficient
mechanism to use is a self-replicating, gene-targeted bioweapon.
Microsoft's
Amalga Life Sciences technology, purchased from vaccine developer March,
theoretically provides a viable platform to develop precisely such bioweapons.
It is interesting that no announcements from the
company appear to have been made since being acquired by Microsoft in 2009,
indicating that their work is now being conducted in total secrecy, behind
closed doors.
U.S. government admits
developing weaponized, deadly flu strains
Recent headlines reveal that the United States government has also secretly
funded bioweapons research that resulted in the development of super-deadly
flu strains that could wipe out far more than just 15 percent of the human
population.
As revealed in
recent news headlines:
"Scientists agreed Friday to a 60-day
moratorium on research into a modified avian flu virus that has been
demonstrated to be more transmissible among mammals.
Although the
investigators believe their research has a public health benefit, they
acknowledge the fear of some governments and others that the genetically
altered virus could escape from labs and infect people."
That may be precisely the point, it turns out.
There is no better way to promote the vaccine
profits of the
pharmaceutical industry than to actually release an
engineered bioweapon virus into the wild. And there is no faster way to
reduce the world population than to engineer either a vaccine or a
weaponized flu virus that burns through the human population, targeting
those of an "undesirable" genetic profile who need to be "cleansed" from the
human gene pool.
This about the next time you think about purchasing,
By doing so, you are funding what could very
well be a global eugenics agenda with the ultimate goal of wiping out a
significant proportion of the human race.
