In 2011 when Muhammar
Qaddafi refused to leave quietly as ruler of Libya, the
Obama Administration, hiding behind the skirts of the
French, launched a
ferocious bombing campaign and a
"No
Fly" zone over the country to aid the so-called fighters
for democracy.
The US lied to Russia and China with help of the
(US-friendly) Gulf Cooperation Council about the
Security Council Resolution on Libya and used it to
illegally justify the war.
The doctrine,
"responsibility to protect" was used instead, the same
doctrine Obama wants
to use in Syria.
Its useful top look at
Libya two years after the NATO humanitarian
intervention.
Chaos in oil industry
Libyas economy is dependent on oil.
Just after the war, Western media
hailed the fact the oil installations were not damaged by the population
bombing and oil production was near normal at 1.4 million barrels/day (bpd).
Then in July the armed guards hired by the government in Tripoli suddenly
revolted and seized control of the eastern oil field terminals they were
supposed to protect. There is where the vast bulk of Libyas oil is
produced, near Benghazi. It goes by pipeline to tankers on the Mediterranean
for export.
When the government lost control of the terminals production and export fell
sharply, then another armed tribal group seized control of two oilfields in
the south blocking oil flow to terminals on the northwest coast.
The tribal
occupiers demanded more pay and went on strike to demand pay and an end to
corruption. The end result is today, early September Libya pumped a mere
150,000 barrels of its capacity of 1.6 million bpd.
Exports have fallen to
80,000 barrels per day. [1]
Armed Militias vs.
Muslim Brotherhood
Libya is an artificial state like much of the Middle East and Africa, carved
out in the colonial era of World War I by Italy.
It is ruled by tribal
consensus among numerous tribes.
Qaddafi was chosen in a long process of
voting by tribal elders that can take up to 15 years I was told by one
expert. When he was murdered and his family hunted, NATO forced rule by a
Muslim Brotherhood-dominated National Transitional Council (NTC).
Now in August a new Assembly was elected dominated again by the Brotherhood
as in Morsi Egypt or Tunisia. Sounds nice on paper.
The reality is that, by
all accounts lawless bands, armed for the first time during the war with
modern weapons, including foreign Al Qaeda and other jihadists are carrying
out daily bombings across the country for local control.
Tripoli itself has
numerous armed gangs controlling sections of the capitol. It is turning into
an armed battle between local tribal militias that are forming and the
Brotherthood that controls the central government.
Leaders in the provinces
of Cyrenaica and Fezzan are considering breaking away from Tripoli and rebel
militias mobilizing across the country. [2]
Bombings in Tripoli
are daily as lawlessness spreads
Nuri Abu Sahmain, Muslim Brotherhood President of the newly elected Congress
has summoned militias allied to the Brotherhood to the capital to try to
prevent a coup, in a move the opposition sees very much like a coup by the
Brotherhood.
The main opposition party, a center-right National Forces
Alliance, as a result just deserted Congress together with several smaller
ethnic parties, leaving the Brotherhoods Justice and Construction party
heading a government with crumbling authority.
"Congress has basically
collapsed," said one diplomat in Tripoli. [3]
The
Obama Administration has
promoted a takeover across the Muslim world from Egypt to Tunisia to Syria
by the secretive Muslim Brotherhood as part of its long-term strategy of
controlling the Muslim Arc of Crisis from Afghanistan to Libya.
As the
Saudi-backed military coup against Brotherhood president Muhammed Morsi in
Egypt in July showed, the Obama strategy has some problems.
Riots and lawlessness
With rising violence the Interior Minister Mohamed Khalifa al Sheikh
resigned in August.
Some 500 prisoners in Tripoli jail did a hunger strike
to protest being held two years without charges. When the government ordered
the Supreme Security Committee to restore order, they began shooting
prisoners through the bars. In July 1200 prisoners escaped a jail after a
riot in Benghazi. In short lawlessness and anarchy is spreading. [4]
Ethnic Berbers, whose militia led the assault on Tripoli in 2011,
temporarily took over the parliament building in Tripoli.
Because the US and
NATO was adamant it wanted no "boots on the ground," instead they freely
gave arms to any and all rebels who would shoot at the Qaddafi government
troops.
Now they still have the guns and Libya was described to me by one
French journalist who had recently been there as,
"the worlds largest open
air arms bazaar," where for cash anyone can buy any modern NATO weapon.
Foreigners have mostly fled Benghazi since the American ambassador was
murdered in the US consulate by jihadi militiamen last September.
And
Libyas military prosecutor Colonel Yussef Ali al-Asseifar, in charge of
investigating assassinations of politicians, soldiers and journalists, was
himself assassinated by a bomb in his car on 29 August. [5]
Prospects are grim as the lawlessness spreads.
Sliman Qajam, a member of the
parliamentary energy committee, told Bloomberg that,
"the government is running on its reserves.
If the situation doesnt improve, it wont be able to pay salaries by
the end of the year."
The Obama Administration argues that the not-yet-proven use by the Assad
government of chemical weapons in Syria justifies a bombing war by NATO and
allies such as,
-
Saudi Arabia
-
Qatar
-
Turkey
-
Jordan,
...based on the
"humanitarian" doctrine deceptively known as "responsibility to protect,"
which argues that certain violations of human rights or safety are so
serious as to transcend international law, UN Charters or US constitutional
requirements and allow on moral grounds any US President to bomb any country
he or she chooses.
Something is not quite right here
