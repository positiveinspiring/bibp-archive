As we ponder the dark implications of living in a world where large numbers
of people rejoice at gruesome stage shows of death and merrily embrace the
murder of decent men, we'll leave you with the final, disgusting words of
the clearly psychopathic...
Hillary Clinton:
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shared a laugh with a
television news reporter moments after hearing deposed
Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi had been killed.
"We came, we saw, he died," she joked when told of
news reports of Qaddafi's death by an aide in
between formal interviews.
Clinton was in Tripoli earlier this week for talks
with leaders of Libya's National Transitional Council (NTC).
The reporter asked if Qaddafi's death had anything to do
with her surprise visit to show support for the Libyan
people.
"No," she replied, before rolling her eyes and saying
"I'm sure it did" with a chuckle.
