Previous attempts to overthrow the dynamic anti-Imperialist Hugo Chavez over a decade ago failed.
Now that they have surgically removed Chavez, they're feverishly back to their dirty tricks, activating their agents, moles and agent provocateurs ready and willing to act at the behest of the Oligarchs.
On March 6, 2013, I wrote the following introduction to a previous article on the upcoming grab for Venezuela and the imperialist program for Latin America.
It's perfectly suited for today as we see the Oligarchs making their move.
Introduction In light of the passing of Hugo Chavez, it's well worth another look at the situation in Latin America where we are bound to see the hand of the Oligarchs making their usual moves to regain banking, economic and political control. And Venezuela just happens to have a whole lot of oil... Sound familiar? Soros and his ilk have been licking their chops to activate their agents in place, no doubt to be disguised as some Latino version of their engineered color revolutions that were so successful in their middle eastern overthrows and the subsequent dismantling and destruction of country after country. Just watch the press go to town now, doing the aerial propaganda bombardment to clear the way of public opinion, as the military machine gets set for the wipe up after another fake "revolt of the people against a monstrous dictatorial regime" is ignited and exacerbated by the usual suspects.

In light of the passing of Hugo Chavez, it's well worth another look at the situation in Latin America where we are bound to see the hand of the Oligarchs making their usual moves to regain banking, economic and political control.
And Venezuela just happens to have a whole lot of oil... Sound familiar?

Just watch the press go to town now, doing the aerial propaganda bombardment to clear the way of public opinion, as the military machine gets set for the wipe up after another fake "revolt of the people against a monstrous dictatorial regime" is ignited and exacerbated by the usual suspects.
Now that the staged protests have started in earnest, it's time to revisit this situation and closely examine it.
These recent articles below show just how intent Washington is to re-escalate the trouble-stirring there.
Behind the Lies About Venezuela's Protests US Secretary of State John Kerry recently called on the Venezuelan government to end the "terror campaign against its own citizens." Kerry's words are just the latest in US and mainstream media efforts to portray the month-long protests in Venezuela as peaceful popular demonstrations against an authoritarian regime that has resorted to repression to quell the uprisings. As a result, the Venezuelan government, as Kerry's statement illustrates, is being blamed for most of the 28 deaths that have occurred. But is this portrayal accurate? A closer look at the reality on the ground paints a very different picture. From the beginning, the protesters have been armed, have conducted widespread arson and have been intent on achieving the unconstitutional overthrow of a democratically-elected government. MORE>

And
US lawmakers push for sanctions on Venezuela
US lawmakers intend to push for sanctions against the Venezuelan government, accusing Caracas of pursuing a terror campaign against protesters. The US Senate has already introduced a bipartisan bill that compels President Barack Obama to target Venezuelan officials, who it says, are involved in violence there. The proposed bill also includes an additional 15 million dollars in funds to help the opposition in the Latin American country. This is while 10 members of the House of Representatives are seeking to impose visa bans, asset freezes and financial sanctions on officials of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government. In addition, the House of Representatives calls for reducing crude imports from the oil rich South American country. MORE>

Same old story, same old script.
The oligarch's are feeling their oats to be opening up so many fronts at once - that or they're in a hurry, which means they have something they're afraid won't get done in time.
For what? Nor hard to guess.
The history of US thuggery in Latin America to promote its own agenda and extort their economies and resources is a long and sordid one.
As documented so well in John Perkins' "Confessions of an Economic Hitman", when the U.S. corporate greed machine and their controlling central bankers want something they will methodically use any means necessary to get it.
Several new yet not so new dynamics have been surfacing in the news over the past months that appear to indicate another wave of attacks in the area is in the offing. Since Chavez's passing we knew we would see these mechanisms put into gear to topple the popular socialist government in Venezuela.
All this is nothing new, nor surprising. The US march of tyranny knows no boundaries.
After all, it's not just the US, the Amerikan military machine is the fascist global military monster attack dog of the central banking cartel consuming everything in its path, and the bloodthirsty US with its easily persuaded populace makes a great henchman.
When this stuff surfaces, just like the staged Asian, Middle Eastern and now Russian "revolts" and various other color revolutions, the groundwork has been getting laid for a long, long time.
A lot of subversive training takes place as they ready for the right opportunity to take full advantage of an apparent "people's voice" and start a rebellion against a regime the US machine wants replaced.
Just look at this hype back in January of last year to prepare the way, as if everything in the region is going to blow. Well, how would they know that unless they were the ones pulling the strings?
Again, conditioning the masses for more war and hegemony:
Death of Hugo Chavez could set off shock waves across region The likelihood that Venezuela's Hugo Chavez is close to death will pitch rivals against one another in a battle for power and oil riches, and trigger political shock waves across the region. Source

A clear set up. It's setting the stage and the US military arm of the oligarchy has the trigger men and detonators ready to activate.
If you want to see how it works, besides the string of overthrows in Latin America and the Middle East, just look at the story of the overthrow of the popularly elected President Mossadegh in Iran in 1953.
He was admittedly overthrown by the CIA via "Operation Ajax" to place an oil and banking cartel puppet fascist named Reza Shah Pahlavi who also was disposed of and killed to make the way for the rise of radical Islam and set the stage for the era of Muslim terrorism, which has morphed into citizen terrorism, the ultimate eternal Orwellian war:
The fact that Mossadegh was elected by the will of Iran's citizens did not deter the efforts of an invigorated CIA that used the Cold War as a pretext to move away from the fact finding agency conceived of by President Harry Truman to an aggressive international political body willing to overthrow nations in contravention of popular national will. Mossadegh immediately angered the international power cartel with which the CIA actively interlinked. British Petroleum had been garnering the lion's share of profits from Iran's wealthy oil deposits. Mossadegh nationalized Iran's oil as a means of obtaining what he deemed to be a fairer portion of that important asset. The nationalization law was passed unanimously by the Iranian Parliament. Despite the fact that BP was offered considerable compensation by Mossadegh his days were numbered after the nationalization bill was passed. Richard Helms, who would later become CIA Director, was prepared to act with a close Iranian friend becoming political beneficiary. A plan was launched to overthrow Iran in a coup and hand over the reins of power to a reliable figure who would accede to the international power elite's interests on behalf of British Petroleum.

The US plans to overthrow Chavez I'm sure have been many more than we hear about, and there's a profound possibility his cancer was induced by CIA/Mossad operatives.
It's standard procedure, along with,
heart attacks getting suicided plane crashes,
heart attacks
getting suicided
plane crashes,
...and the like.
Chavez was supposed to have been taken out after the staged 9/11 event as one Rockefeller confided to Aaron Russo, who also suspiciously died of an aggressive cancer after he blew the whistle on all this.
Here's Russo's talk to an interviewer...
Listen all the way through, it's one of the greatest exposes of the cold, calculated elite mindset you'll see from a first hand encounter and specifically mentions their designs for Venezuela:
And sure enough, a neo-con coup attempt was temporarily successful in 2002 with the installment of an elite businessman as President.
However, massive pro-Chavez demonstrations that even drew military support forced the Bush installed government out and Chavez took back control (story here).
And as you know, they've been busy demonizing Chavez ever since, setting up for their next run at taking over the country.
They sure as hell didn't stop trying to overthrow Chavez there. They just morph and regroup and now with his death you can expect to see the carefully orchestrated media charade of the "rise of the people's voice" against this "horrible dictatorial regime" that wouldn't bow to the pressures of the globalist bankers. All staged. And they don't care if a civil war brings Venezuela to ruins.
They'll get their oil rights and pillage their banks, as usual, if they have their way.
Another apparent thorn in the elite's side is the dynamic leader of Ecuador, President Rafael Correa.
The bankster elite don't take kindly to being stood up to.
When Correa offered asylum to Assange it really ruffled some feathers. But the closing of the US Manta military base in Ecuador was huge. He also insisted on a large delivery of Ecuador's gold from the Bank of London's vaults.
He's also been working on tax reforms including the financial sector that are stepping on some serious toes since as we all know, you don't tax the banksters (see here)
Globalists don't take kindly to independent thought or actions.
And Correa knows that...
Ecuadorian president warns of possible 'CIA attack' before elections Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa has said the CIA may try to kill him prior to upcoming elections. Citing reports of a plot to "destabilize the region," Correa said the threats were "credible," given the history of US involvement in Latin America. Correa alluded to reports by Chilean journalist Patricio Mery Bell, who allegedly passed on information to the Ecuadorian government that President Correa's life was "under threat" by a CIA plot. "There are many cases of [the CIA] interfering" in Latin American affairs, Correa said during a campaign tour in the coastal province of Guayas. "These are credible [reports] because this has happened before in Latin America."

CIA Money Flooding In
Bell first voiced his concerns for the safety of President Correa three months ago when he released a report claiming the CIA sought to "destabilize" Ecuador. He said that the threat to Correa's life would be at its height from January 15 and onwards, as Correa applies to run for another presidential term. "We will have to be three times more vigilant with President Correa," Bell said in an interview with publication El Ciudadano. Bell maintained that although he was not a staunch supporter of Correa, it was his duty as a Latin American citizen to warn of the alleged $88-million CIA plot to destabilize the Ecuadorian government. The journalist believes that this money will be divided amongst extremist anarchist, leftist and hardline conservative groups, in the hopes of discrediting Correas. Source

Nasty...
The present day bankster elites and their minions have been making headway into the Latin lands for decades and already have a de facto stranglehold.
They just always want more, and to punish those who stand up against them.
Remember they've seriously bolstered US military presence in Haiti following the very convenient earthquake, making it much like the Puerto Rico military outpost, just a stone's throw away as another operational base to "help" insurgents in Venezuela.
There are now 13 Latin American countries where the US either has bases or has funded local bases capable of hosting US forces. Not the least of which is Colombia, Venezuela's rival neighbor.
These buggers take time to set things up to get the biggest bang for their buck.
Are they going to try to spread unrest throughout the entire region, as they've done in the Middle East?
If it suits their purposes they will. However, the Latins are very aware of US interference so if the Elites push this they may be in for a surprise, as the Latins have grown more politically savvy over the years.
Not only that, China has also made serious investments and commitments in the region and will not sit idly by. How interesting that the Chinese approach to global influence is expanding economic relationships rather than brute force.
Which influence would you choose in a pinch?
Keep your eyes peeled, and please alert any loved ones or friends in Latin America as to these designs.
