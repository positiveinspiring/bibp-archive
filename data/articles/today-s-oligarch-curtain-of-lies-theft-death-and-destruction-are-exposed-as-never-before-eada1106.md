In psychology our belief system shapes our
perceptions of the world around us, in fact becoming our very sense of
reality.
Our primary caregivers, most often our parents,
project their view of us and their world onto us and we in turn internalize
their views as our own sense of developing self and world view. In this last
century the influence of mass media has also come to increasingly shape our
world and self-concept.
As adolescents and young adults we often change
and modify our perceptions of the world based on our own interpersonal
experience particularly with peers and movement to finding resonance with a
more authentic, individuated self in relation to our surrounding world.
But with time and more adult experience
often comes an existential dilemma and/or crisis if and when we encounter
growing dissonance between what we thought we knew and changing reality
input increasingly at odds with our old world view.
Currently in America and many places throughout
the world many of us are undergoing a fundamental change in our belief
system as we come to realize what we have been taught as reality turns out
anything but. Many of us on the planet are currently undergoing a
mind-altering, transformative shift in how we view life and our world, in
effect causing a simultaneous global shift of belief amongst a sizeable
portion of the earth's population.
An unprecedented shift is moving away from what
we humans have traditionally and historically been told is the truth to a
state of mounting disbelief, skepticism and doubt in what our political
leaders, mainstream media and educational systems have been feeding us since
we were young.
Today more and more people around the globe are
waking up to the new emerging reality and insight that what we have
historically been taught, socialized and raised to believe politically as
the truth is but a crock of outright bullshit.
Trends and polls in recent years have documented
this shift in world view consciousness, consistently showing a growing
distrust toward the federal government in both the U.S. and Europe.
-
The Edelman poll from January this year
found that nearly
two out of
three Americans distrust their government
-
The Reason-Rupe poll from April 2014
indicates
three out
of four Americans believe their politicians are corrupt.
-
Last October Pew Research Center
discovered that more than
four out of
five Americans do not trust their own government either
at all or most of the time, a near all time high level for measuring
government distrust.
Declaring results from last month's
parliamentary election a complete and utter failure for the European Union
to become "the next United States of Europe," (as European Commission Vice
President
Viviane Reding
refers to her EU government), a surging backlash of
vehement anti-EU
voters from all over Europe sent fringe elements from both the
left and right to Brussels with the specific agenda to get rid of the
European Union once and for all.
The voters' ire was heard from the stagnant
economy of France and austerity-wary Greece, through Denmark all the way to
Britain.
A strong push for
Ireland
to opt out of the EU is in process. Many residents in especially southern
Europe hit hardest with severe austerity measures imposed by powerful
Germany are blaming the continental government.
Oil-rich
Scotland
is even leading a separatist movement seeking independence from Britain.
Many Europeans expressed contempt for big government that they blame for
high unemployment and failed policies deemed unresponsive to meeting their
localized needs.
Beyond the U.S. and Europe, more citizens around
the globe are growing angrier with their elected officials, realizing
politicians' priority is to serve the needs of their oligarch puppet master
over the needs of their own people.
Similar negative sentiments toward mainstream
media also represent an across the boards distrust toward corporatized media
coverage of world events. Recently more people are seeking alternative
online news sources for their information in response to growing public
awareness that corporate media has become a mere extension of the government
as its chief propagandist disinformation outlet.
Even such traditionally prestigious and
reputable newspapers like the Washington Post, New York Times and Wall
Street Journal are now regarded as in-bed, embedded journalism fused with
the government.
As such, last year's June Gallup poll indicated
that a
whopping 80% of
Americans aged 21 to 64 find mainstream media lacks credibility.
All these results reflect a growing trend that
an increasing segment of both the U.S. and global population has come to
believe and accept that they are systematically and regularly lied to and
misinformed by their corrupt leaders in both government as well as corporate
media.
As products of their social and cultural
environments, humans raised in the West have been victims of a massive
global brainwash forced into a world of duplicitous dualism to "choose"
sides, of course choosing the political side of their own nation, culture,
ethnicity and/or religion, conned into automatically accepting that their
nation/culture/religion is far more righteous and superior in comparison to
others on the opposing side.
Since World War II those of us in North America
have been dished the demonized view of Communist nations Russia and China,
and now with cold war part two in full swing, they have come full circle
again at our so called enemies. Then after the fall of the Soviet empire,
and the
9/11 neocon false
flag attack, came the new U.S. manufactured villain Osama bin
Laden and his band of evil bad guys, the al Qaeda terrorist network.
Always those who appear most foreign and
different from us are deemed the bad guys of the world.
Fortunately over time this oversimplified, black
and white rerun version of the world has been challenged and exposed as
jingoistic bias and distortion of how our complicated world actually is.
Many of us have intuitively known all along that as members of the same
human species, the striking similarities of our common human nature that
bind us together far outweigh whatever differences in culture, skin color,
nationality, political ideology, global region or religion.
What many of us are increasingly realizing both
here in America as well as in other nations around the globe is that we have
been purposely and methodically lied to and manipulated for a very long
time.
The education
system in America is more about socializing, programming and
brainwashing young people into becoming obedient, mindless, robotic adults
than learning any real truth or learning to cultivate and use their critical
faculties to seek the truth amidst the world of illusion.
This "us versus them," "you're either with us or
against us" dichotomy has been forever used as an artificial manmade device
to separate humans into an
in-group versus
out-group duality.
Unfortunately it has been operating nonstop ever
since cavemen first emerged from their caves and encountered other human
tribes.
Through human migration and modern technology of
air travel and most recently internet travel, more than any time prior in
man's relative short history on earth, Canadian communications philosopher
Marshall McLuhan's
concept of the world seen as a "global village" has shrunk the
earth into a here and now everyday accepted reality.
As a result, in recent years the world view of
nations and continents has become somewhat more homogenized, made more
accessible by mass media technology that transcends both geography and
culture. Learning and communicating with people from diverse cultures and
backgrounds have brought the world closer.
That said, conversely the earth today is
geopolitically moving rapidly toward more fragmented polarization, driven by
a single globalization economy owned, controlled and operated by a global
oligarchy. Its perverse vision of
a New World Order currently has much of
the global population brainwashed to fear, mistrust, hate and kill each
other with unparalleled potential.
But not all of us are being fooled by such
divisively spun projections from a shadowy elite madly pulling their
deceptive spin levers cloaked behind their gold curtain. An honest look at
what is actually happening now around the world exposes the oligarch agenda
to purposely increase worldwide tension, division and conflict.
Last February's notorious power grabbing
political coup pulled off by the U.S.
in Ukraine installing a weak, corrupt
and vicious fascist government certainly was no accident.
Neither was the IMF loan immediately slapped on
the Ukrainian people. Neither is the current civil war raging in eastern
Ukraine where government forces are committing war atrocities and ethnic
cleansing against a majority population of ethnic Russians. Nor for that
matter is the ongoing political crisis occurring this entire year long in
Venezuela a mere random accident.
By carefully orchestrated design, the
U.S.-EU-NATO alliance is obediently carrying out the oligarch high command
to destabilize, polarize and militarize every continent on earth, pitting
regional adversaries against each other in a
global offensive
with the West jabbing and baiting the East into military conflict from the
Arctic to every corner of the globe.
Right now in Asia tensions are mounting between
China and North Korea on the one side and on the other U.S. allied neighbors
Japan, South Korea, Philippines and Vietnam where a new U.S. naval base is
planned.
Then there is the perennial hotbed of a mess
exploding right now in the Middle East. The same war pattern has been raging
in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. And with covert predator
drone operations
likewise going on for years in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, the U.S. is
extending its imperialistic military foothold and hegemony further south
with Special Operations stretching deep into Sub-Saharan Africa.
For well over three years Washington has been
using U.S. taxpayer dollars to arm, bankroll and train al Qaeda extremist
militants throughout the Middle East and Africa to fight as its proxy
mercenaries against Syrian leader Assad's government forces as an obvious
precursor to launching war against Syria's foremost ally Iran.
Obama just pledged another half billion dollars
in arms to those same al Qaeda rebels in Syria.
But recently with the Syrian army gaining the
upper hand, Washington made the decision to seek yet another regime change
in Iraq, sending the so called Islamic Soldiers of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)
sweeping downward from Syria into Iraq, taking over every major city in that
country except the Shiite stronghold in the capital Baghdad.
A major bloodbath awaits as the sectarian civil
war America created years ago shifts into bloody regime-change overdrive.
The U.S. is guilty of backing both opposing sides in Iraq, ISIS and its weak
Maliki puppet government, not unlike how oligarchs back both Republicans and
Democrats using the old, highly effective, deceptive divide and conquer
strategy.
Of course a similar situation in
Afghanistan
has the Taliban enemy controlling most of the nation's territory, waiting
six more months for U.S. troops to withdraw by the end of the year.
The 9800 U.S. designated soldiers left behind
will supposedly be in an advisory role for the Afghan National Army. The
U.S. war on drugs has bolstered the pockets of both the U.S. drug smuggling
operation as well as raising millions of dollars for the Taliban cause that
controls the poppy field heroin production.
The current undoing of ten years of costly
American war and occupation of Iraq will more than likely be replicated in
Afghanistan in 2015 as the surging Taliban will then be closing in on the
capital Kabul.
In the meantime, virtually every other so called
Arab spring
CIA-Special Ops-induced regime change has been disastrous for the
native populations.
For example, in Egypt a third U.S. supported
government is run by an over-the-top, oppressive military dictatorship.
Meanwhile, the U.S. has created a highly chaotic, lawless, and violent
failed state now in Libya. The oligarch planetary vision of destabilizing
every Third World nation on earth is currently working according to plan now
at an accelerated pace.
In recent decades America has moved from a
corporatized pseudo-democracy to a
full
fledge oligarchy where oligarchs owning the most powerful
transnational corporations have merged with virtually all national
governments, regardless of ideology and culture. More than ever these days,
money buys power.
No longer does the U.S. President, the U.S.
Congress, nor the U.S. Supreme Court represent the interests of the American
people but as hand-picked players operating within a corrupt oligarchy, they
are all beholding to the powerbrokers that have made them their political
puppets in charge of doing their evil bidding.
As such, virtually all of the key political
players today are treasonous traitors guilty of betraying the U.S.
Constitution that under oath they all swore to protect and uphold, and also
betraying U.S. citizens for failing to represent the very people who voted
them into power.
Through the process of
globalization and
privatization, a parallel process to America has been unfolding
with nearly every nation and national government on every continent on
earth.
Deploying U.S.-EU-NATO power, the oligarchs have
had their way with all governments. Thus the people on this planet have
little to no say or power over their lives since a morally bankrupt global
economic system of indentured servitude and slavery keep people drowning in
insurmountable debt.
These days people find themselves working longer
and harder for less money just to keep a roof over their heads and food on
the table for their families. However, in this growing era of severe global
austerity and impoverishment, increasing pressures of providing for their
families have too many people barely able to survive, and regretfully many
around the globe are not.
Mounting inequality and
disparity between
the rich and poor are also accelerating to unprecedented levels
globally. The elite 1% of oligarchs and their power-broking stewards
continue growing exceedingly richer at the expense of the rest of us
have-nots on the planet. War, poverty and illness are becoming the new
normal far beyond Third World nations.
EU countries throughout southern Europe as well
as the U.S. are on an ominous fast track to economic collapse.
Led by cold war enemies and strongest BRICS
nations Russia and China, a growing international movement is afoot to
dump the U.S.
dollar as the standard international currency, which amounts to
an approaching fiscal cliff for America.
Over 40% and rising of
America's adult
working age population have not been working when the real
unemployment rate include the growing masses who stopped looking for jobs
that no longer exist for them. During the last couple decades, mothers as
single parents
have been struggling to raise America's children, for the first time
replacing the two parent nuclear family as head of household majority.
More than half of U.S. adults up to age 25 still
live with their
parents. But due to increasing financial necessity, a growing
trend of even older adults and their children are being forced to move back
in with parents at never before seen rates. U.S. college students and young
graduates today are mired in college loan debt now exceeding a
trillion dollars,
as of 2010 even surpassing the nation's credit card debt.
Upwardly mobile
progress is long gone in America as the younger adult generations
now for the first time can no longer expect to enjoy the same higher
standard of living as their parents.
The fast changing sociological economic dynamics
of the family structure and how younger generations of Americans are being
raised in an increasing climate of uncertainty and despair is far different
and far bleaker than all previous generations throughout American history.
Without a
manufacturing sector left in the U.S. and a decimated middle
class from funding an overstretched American Empire waging too many wars
around the world, America is a debtor nation dependent as a consumer society
on cheap outsourced products mostly from China.
U.S. permanent war policy with its conveniently
fabricated "war on terror" has drained the middle class during a severe
recession still floundering without recovery, chiefly caused by greedy
banksters and Wall Street criminals who further gouged already emaciated
taxpayers with enormous "too big to fail" bailouts.
The national priority in the U.S. has clearly
been to not take care of its own citizens but instead wage the longest
running wars in U.S. history to ensure that the military security complex as
the sole
profiteers of war
get filthily richer while reeking havoc all over the world
with destabilizing regime changes, massive death and global destruction.
Meanwhile, the overburdened middle class
shrinks to
an all time low as the poor in America reach an all time
high while decaying inner city war zones and rotting domestic infrastructure
remain long neglected disasters waiting to happen.
As a result of all this blatant theft, gross
mismanagement of dwindling resources and pervasive criminal malfeasance,
America is hopelessly stalled and a long ways from recovering from the 2008
bubble burst. Since 2008 the world's total government debt has
increased by 40%
while the largest bailed out banks have grown by a hefty 37% just in the
last six years alone.
Yet for all its criminal theft and human
suffering caused, not one bankster or corporate executive has been indicted
or gone to prison for nearly bankrupting the richest, most powerful nation
on earth.
Meanwhile, predatory worldwide IMF and world
bank loans have opportunistically straight-jacketed Third World nations into
debts they have no chance of repaying, leaving them defenseless against
their homelands being plundered by predatory privatizing transnationals bent
on extracting and stealing every last ounce of underground natural resource
available on the planet.
This calculated, sinister process of
globalization, privatization and increasing militarization bringing more
wars to the planet is all part of the preplanned oligarch agenda to
literally squeeze the life out of the world's population of seven billion
people, eugenically thinning the human herd down to anywhere from just a
meager
half to one billion
people.
This means that up to 13 out of 14 of us
currently living on planet earth right now are slated to be mass murdered
within the next few years.
This is how the oligarchic plan for a New World
Order will be fulfilled, complete with implanted micro-chips in the less
than a billion people left on earth as the calculated number of humans still
needed to serve as the oligarch's subservient lackey class. This is their
diabolical agenda currently being methodically executed to make life on
planet earth over the long haul more sustainable for them and them only.
With all this increasing theft, death and
destruction on every continent reaching such an explosive, unprecedented
scale where World War III is all but impending, by now every alert citizen
of the world should recognize what a handful of wealthy oligarch families
have been doing for centuries to this planet - manipulating and enslaving
the global masses through centuries of imperialist empire hegemony and
controlling international economies at will though war making.
How can so few number of humans control and
willfully destroy so many humans? Very evilly
as psychopaths.
But then they have had centuries of practice,
skillfully, secretively operating in back shadows, using their puppet front
men as their government leaders to lie constantly to the people. And of
course for quite awhile they have had mass media bombarding us with nonstop
lies, propaganda, disinformation and deceit just to make certain populations
are kept in the dark.
Today with big sports, video games, celebrity
worship and digital toys galore, their ploy is to keep the masses distracted
and ignorant of what has been really going on for a very, very long time.
Through whitewashed history books that purposely
cover up this same dark truth through the ages, Americans have long been
brainwashed and mesmerized into accepting their illusion of democracy,
equality, freedom and justice, but for only a few, not all of us as we were
always led to believe.
But as demonstrated most recently by the world
focus on the latest
annual Bilderberg gathering in Copenhagen, the oligarchs
are unable to pull the strings from afar any longer without our noticing.
Though they wield ultimate power over all the
most prominent governments and corporations on earth, there are seven
billion human beings who are beginning to wake up now and are onto their
evil agenda. Oligarchs taking notice and fast becoming nervous as their
Oz-like curtain is finally being lifted once and for all.
And behind that curtain we find a handful of
wrinkled, prune faced, feeble old white men who look like Mr. Burns on the
Simpsons still calling all the shots, but ultimately exposed naked like
never before.
With more and more of us world citizens every
single day becoming aware of their vicious and heinous crimes against
humanity, against all of us on this earth, like never before we are in a
unique position of burgeoning power to call them on their diabolical plan
and evildoing.
We have at our collective disposal much more
power than we even know at this relatively early stage of mindful
resistance.
As globally aware, ethically-motivated, humane
and compassionate citizens of the world, we possess the opportunity to
finally break free of the shackles that have stifled and enslaved humanity
for far too long.
Overwhelming similarities are currently binding
us earthlings together as richly diverse members of the same humanoid family
as well as like minded world citizen-activists committed to doing our
collective active best in bringing about peace and justice to our ailing,
only planet, before the handful of hugely outnumbered oligarchs destroy
everything we hold most dear and sacred.
It is up to us ordinary decent people to
recognize the truth and bravely act on that truth in unified solidarity for
the sake of preserving life on earth in the way that God intended.
Again, our beliefs and our actions will
determine our reality.
