B.C.
Julius Caesar (right) took back from
the money changers the power to coin money and then minted coins for the
benefit of all. With this new, plentiful supply of money, he established
many massive construction projects and built great public works. By
making money plentiful, Caesar won the love of the common people.
But the money changers hated him for it and this is why Caesar was
assassinated. Immediately after his assassination came the demise of
plentiful money in Rome, taxes increased, as did corruption.
Eventually the Roman money supply was reduced by 90 per cent, which
resulted in the common people losing their lands and homes.
30 A.D.
Jesus
in the last year of his life uses physical force to throw the money
changers out of the temple. This was the only time during the the life
of his ministry in which he used physical force against anyone.
When Jews came to Jerusalem to pay their Temple tax, they could only pay
it with a special coin, the half-shekel. This was a half-ounce of pure
silver, about the size of a quarter.
It was the only coin at that time which was pure silver and of assured
weight, without the image of a pagan Emperor, and therefore to the Jews
it was the only coin acceptable to God.
Unfortunately these coins were not plentiful, the money changers had
cornered the market on them, and so they raised the price of them to
whatever the market could bear. They used their monopoly they had on
these coins to make exorbitant profits, forcing the Jews to pay whatever
these money changers demanded.
Jesus threw the money changers out as their monopoly on these
coins totally violated the sanctity of God's house. These money
changers called for his death days later.
1024
The money changers had control of Medieval
England's money supply and at this time were generally known as
goldsmiths. Paper money started out and this was simply a receipt you
would get after depositing gold with a goldsmith, in their safe rooms or
vaults. This paper started being traded as it was far more convenient
than carrying round a lot of heavy gold and silver coins.
Over time, to simplify the process, the receipts were made to the
bearer, rather than to the individual depositor, making it readily
transferable without the need for a signature. This, also, broke the tie
to any identifiable deposit of gold.
Eventually the goldsmiths recognized that only a fraction of
depositors ever came in and demanded their gold at any one time, so
they found out how they could cheat on the system. They started to issue
more receipts than they had gold to back those receipts and no one would
be any the wiser. They would loan out these receipts which were not
backed by the gold they had in their depositories and collect interest
on them.
This was the birth of the system we know today as Fractional
Reserve Banking, and like this system of today this meant the
goldsmiths were able to make astronomical amounts of money by loaning
out, what was essentially fraudulent receipts, as they were for
gold the goldsmiths didn't even possess. As they gradually got more
confident they would loan out up to 10 times the amount they had in
their deposits.
To simplify how they made money on this, let's give an example in which
a goldsmith charges the same rate of interest to creditors and debtors.
In this example a goldsmith would pay interest of 6% on gold you had
deposited with them, and then charge 6% interest on money, I mean
fraudulent receipts, you borrowed from them. As they would lend out ten
times what you had deposited with them, whilst they're paying you 6%
interest, they are making 60% interest. This is on your gold.
The goldsmiths also discovered that their control of this fraudulent
money supply gave them control over the economy and the assets of the
people. They exacted their control by rowing the economy between easy
money and tight money.
The way they did this was to make money easy to borrow and therefore
increase the amount of money in circulation, then suddenly tighten the
money supply, taking it out of circulation by making loans more
difficult to get or stopping offering them altogether.
Why did they do this? Simple, because the result would be a certain
percentage of the people being unable to repay their previous loans, and
not having the facility to take out new ones, so they would go bankrupt
and be forced to sell their assets to the goldsmiths for literally
pennies on the dollar.
This is exactly what happens in the world economy of today, but is
referred to with words like, "the business cycle," "boom and bust,"
"recession," and "depression," in order to confuse the population of the
money changers scam.
1100
King Henry I (right) succeeds King William II to the throne
of England. During his reign he decided to take the power the money
changers had over the people, and he did this by creating a completely
new form of money that took the form of a stick! This stick was called,
a "talley stick," and ended up being the longest lasting form of
currency, lasting 726 years until 1826 (even though other currencies
came and went in that same period and ran alongside the talley sticks).
The talley stick was a stick of polished wood into which notches were
cut along one side, to indicate the denomination of money the stick
represented. The stick was then split lengthwise through the notches, so
that both pieces had a record of the notches. The King kept one half to
protect against counterfeiting and the other half was spent into the
economy and circulated as money.
It was also one of the most successful money systems in history, as the
King demanded that all the King's taxes had to be paid in, "talley
sticks," so this increased their circulation and acceptance as a
legitimate form of money. This system would work well in keeping the
power away from the money changers in England.
1225
St. Thomas Aquinas (right) is born, the leading theologian of
the Catholic Church who argued that the charging of interest is wrong
because it applies to "double charging," charging for both the money and
the use of the money.
This concept followed the teachings of Aristotle that taught the purpose
of money was to serve the members of society and to facilitate the
exchange of goods needed to lead a virtuous life. Interest was contrary
to reason and justice because it put an unnecessary burden on the use of
money.
Thus, Church law in Middle Ages Europe forbade the charging of interest
on loans and even made it a crime called, "usury."
1509
King Henry VIII (below) succeeds King
Henry VII to the throne in England. During his reign he relaxed the laws
regarding usury, and and the money changers did not waste any time in
re-asserting themselves over the population.
They quickly made their gold and silver coin
system plentiful again. It is interesting to note that under King Henry
VIII the Church of England separated from Roman Catholicism, whose
Church law prevented the charging of interest on money.
1553
Queen Mary I (below) succeeds Lady
Jane Grey's nine day reign to the throne in England. During her reign,
Queen Mary I, a staunch Catholic, tightened the usury laws again.
The money changers were not amused and in
revenge they tightened the money supply by hoarding gold and silver
coins and causing the economy to plummet.
1558
Queen Elizabeth I (below) succeeds
Queen Mary I, her half sister, to the throne in England. During her
reign, Queen Elizabeth I decided that in order to wrest control of the
money supply she would have to issue her own gold and silver coins.
She did this through the public treasury and
successfully took control of the money supply from the money changers.
1609
The money changers in the Netherlands
establish the the first central bank in history, in Amsterdam.
1642
Oliver Cromwell (below) is financed
by the money changers for the purposes of fomenting a revolution in
England, and allowing them to take control of the money system again.
After much bloodshed, Cromwell finally purges the parliament, overthrows
King Charles I and puts him to death in 1649.
The money changers immediately consolidate
their power and for the next few decades plunge Great Britain into a
costly series of wars. They also take over a square mile of property in
the center of London which becomes known as the City of London.
1688
The money changers in England following a
series of squabbles with the Stuart Kings, Charles II (1660 - 1685) and
James II (1685 - 1688), conspire with their far more successful money
changing counterparts in the Netherlands, who had already set up a
central bank there.
They decide to finance an invasion by
William of Orange (above) of Netherlands who they sound out and
establish will be more favorable to them. The invasion is successful and
William of Orange ascends to the throne in England as King William III
in 1689.
1694
Following a costly series of wars over the
last 50 years, English Government officials go, cap in hand, to the
money changers for loans necessary to pursue their political purposes.
The money changers agree to solve this problem in exchange for a
government sanctioned privately owned bank which could issue money
created out of nothing.
This was deceptively named the, "Bank of England," for the sole purpose
of duping the general public into believing it was part of the
government, which it was not.
Like any other private corporation the Bank
of England sold shares to get started. The private investors, whose
names were never revealed, were supposed to put up £1,250,000 in gold
coins to buy their shares in the bank, but only £750,000 was ever
received. Despite that the bank was duly chartered and began loaning out
several times the money it supposedly had in reserves, all at interest.
Although
the Bank of England's private investors were never revealed, one of the
Directors, William Paterson (right) stated,
"The Bank hath benefit of interest on
all monies which it creates out of nothing.
Furthermore the Bank of England would loan
government officials as much of the new currency as they wanted, as long
as they secured the debt by direct taxation of the British people. The
Bank of England amounted to nothing less than the legal counterfeiting
of a national currency for private gain, and thus any country that would
fall under the control of a private bank would amount to nothing more
than a plutocracy.
Soon after the Bank of England was formed it attacked the talley stick
system, as it was money outside of the power of the money changers, just
as King Henry I had intended it to be.
1698
Following four years of the Bank of England,
their plan to control the money supply had come on in leaps and bounds.
They had flooded the country with so much money that the Government debt
to the Bank had grown from the initial £1,250,000, to £16,000,000, in
only four years. That's an increase of 1,280%.
Why do they do it? Simple, if the money in circulation in a country is
£5,000,000, and a central bank is set up and prints another £15,000,000,
stage one of the plan, sends it out into the economy through loans etc,
than this will reduce the value of the initial £5,000,000 in circulation
before the bank was formed. This is because the initial £5,000,000 is
now only 25% of the economy. It will also give the bank control of 75%
of the money in circulation with the £15,000,000 they sent out into the
economy.
This also causes inflation which is the reduction in worth of money
borne by the common person, due to the economy being flooded with too
much money, an economy which the Central Bank are responsible for. As
the common person's money is worth less, he has to go to the bank to get
a loan to help run his business etc, and when the Central Bank are
satisfied there are enough people with debt out there, the bank will
tighten the supply of money by not offering loans. This is stage two of
the plan.
Stage three, is sitting back and waiting for the debtors to them to go
bankrupt, allowing the bank to then seize from them real wealth,
businesses and property etc, for pennies on the dollar. Inflation never
effects a central bank in fact they are the only group who can benefit
from it, as if they are ever short of money they can simply print more.
1757
Benjamin Franklin travels to England
and would spend the next 18 years of his life there until just before
the start of the American Revolution.
1760
Mayer Amschel Bauer changes him name
to Mayer Amschel Rothschild and sets up the,
House Of Rothschild, and soon learns
that if he loans out money to Governments and Royalty then this is far
more profitable than loaning to individuals. This is because the loans
made are bigger and backed by their nations' taxes.
He trains his five sons in the art of money
creation.
1764
Benjamin Franklin (right) is asked by officials of the Bank
of England to explain the prosperity of the colonies in America. He
replies,
"That is simple. In the Colonies we
issue our own money. It is called Colonial Scrip. We issue it in
proper proportion to the demands of trade and industry to make the
products pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this
manner creating for ourselves our own paper money, we control its
purchasing power, and we have no interest to pay no one."
As a result of Franklin's statement, the
British Parliament hurriedly passed the Currency Act of 1764. This
prohibited colonial officials from issuing their own money and ordered
them to pay all future taxes in gold or silver coins.
Referring to after this act was passed,
Franklin would state the following in his autobiography,
"In one year, the conditions were so
reversed that the era of prosperity ended, and a depression set in,
to such an extent that the streets of the colonies were filled with
the unemployed... The colonies would gladly have borne the little
tax on tea and other matters had it not been that England took away
from the colonies their money which created unemployment and
dissatisfaction.
The viability of the colonists to get power to issue their own money
permanently out of the hands of King George III and the
international bankers was the prime reason for the revolutionary
war."
Control of America's money system will
change hands 8 times since 1764.
1775
April 19th, start of the revolutionary war
in Lexington, Massachusetts. By this time the colonies had been drained
of silver and gold coins as a result of British taxation. As a result of
this, the continental government had no choice but to print money to
finance the war.
At the start of the revolution the American money supply stood at
$12,000,000. By the end of the war it was nearly $500,000,000 and as a
result the currency was virtually worthless. An example of this is that
a pair of shoes now sold for $5,000 dollars. This also shows the danger
of printing too much money.
The reason Colonial Scrip had worked was
because just enough was used to facilitate trade.
1781
Towards the end of the American Revolution
the Continental Congress were desperate for money, so they allowed
Robert Morris (right), their Financial Superintendent, to open a
privately owned central bank, in the hope this would sort out the money
problem.
Morris was a wealthy man who had grown wealthier during the revolution
by trading in war materials. This first central bank in America was
called the Bank of North America, which was set up with a four year
charter, and was closely modeled after the Bank of England. It was
allowed to practice the fraudulent system of fractional reserve
banking, so it could create money it didn't have, then charge
interest on it.
The bank's charter called for private investors to put up $400,000 of
initial capital, which Morris found himself unable to raise.
Nevertheless he unashamedly used his political influence to have gold
deposited in the bank, which had been loaned to America by France.
Morris then loaned the money he needed to buy this bank from this
deposit of gold that belonged to the government, or rather the American
people.
This Bank of North America, again deceptively named so the common people
would believe it was under the control of the government, was given a
monopoly over the national currency.
1785
Despite the promises of Robert Morris that his privately owned
Bank of North America would solve the problem with the money supply,
of course the economy continued to plummet, forcing the Continental
Congress not to renew the bank's charter.
The leader of the effort to kill this bank
was William Findlay (right) of Pennsylvania, who stated,
"This institution, having no principle
but that of avarice, will never be varied in its objective... to
engross all the wealth, power and influence of the state."
Mayer Amschel Rothschild moves his
family home to a five storey home in Frankfurt, Germany, which he shares
with the Schiff family, (a descendant of both Rothschild and Schiff,
Jacob Schiff, who would be born in this house, would, some 128 years
later, be instrumental in the setting up of the Federal Reserve).
1787
Colonial
leaders assemble in Philadelphia to replace the Articles of
Confederation with the Constitution (right). Governor Morris
headed the final draft of the Constitution and he knew the motivation of
the bankers well as he had once worked for them. Governor Morris along
with his former boss Robert Morris, and Alexander Hamilton had presented
the original plan for the Bank of North America to the Continental
Congress, in the final year of the Revolution.
Fortunately Governor Morris by this time had discovered his conscience,
defected from Robert Morris, and in a letter to James Madison dated July
2nd of this year he stated,
"The rich will strive to establish their
dominion and enslave the rest. They always did. They always will...
They will have the same effect here as elsewhere, if we do not, by
the power of government, keep them in their proper spheres."
James Madison (above) was opposed to
a privately owned central bank after seeing the exploitation of the
people by the Bank of England. Thomas Jefferson was also against it, and
Jefferson later made the following statement,
"If the American people ever allow
private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by
inflation, then by deflation, the banks and the corporations which
grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until
their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers
conquered."
Sadly the words of wisdom of Governor
Morris (above) and Thomas Jefferson fell on deaf ears. Alexander
Hamilton, Robert Morris and Thomas Wyling, convinced the the bulk of the
delegates to this Constitutional convention, not to give Congress the
power to issue paper money.
They were aware that most of these delegates were still reeling from the
wild inflation of the paper money during the revolution. These delegates
also had short memories and didn't remember how well Colonial Scrip had
worked before the war, or Benjamin Franklin's words of wisdom in 1764.
As a result the Constitution was silent on the issue of paper money by
the Government for the citizens, leaving a wide open door for money
changers in the future.
1790
Less than 3 years after the Constitution had
been signed, the newly appointed First Secretary of the Treasury,
Alexander Hamilton, proposed a bill to the Congress calling for a
new privately owned central bank.
Interestingly, Alexander Hamilton's first
job after graduating from law school in 1782 was as an aide to Robert
Morris, a man who he had written to in 1781 stating,
"a national debt if it is not excessive
will be to us a national blessing."
1791
The three main players behind the Bank Of
North America were: Robert Morris; Alexander Hamilton; and the Bank's
President, Thomas Willing (below). These men did not give up and
Alexander Hamilton, now Secretary of the Treasury, a man who described
Robert Morris as his, "mentor," managed to get a new privately owned
central bank through the new Congress.
This new bank was called the, "First Bank of
the United States," and was exactly the same as the Bank of North
America. Robert Morris controlled it, Thomas Willing was the Bank's
President, only the name had changed.
This bank came into being after a year of intense debate and was given a
20 year charter. It was given a monopoly on printing United States
currency even though 80% of it's stock was held by private investors.
The other 20% was purchased by the United States government, but this
was not to give it a piece if the action, but to provide the capital for
the private investors to purchase the other 80%.
As with the Bank of England and the old Bank of North America,
these private investors never paid the full agreed amount for their
shares. What
happened
was through the fraudulent system of fractional reserve banking, the
government's 20% stake which was $2,000,000 in cash, was used to make
loans to its private investors to purchase the other 80% stake,
£8,000,000, for this risk free investment.
Again like the Bank of England and the old Bank of North America, the
name, "First Bank of the United States," was deliberately chosen to hide
from the common people the fact that it was privately owned. The names
of the investors in this bank were never revealed, although it is now
widely believed that the Rothschilds were behind it.
Interestingly in 1790 when Alexander Hamilton (right) proposed
this bank in Congress, Mayer Amschel Rothschild made the following
statement from his bank in Frankfurt, Germany,
"Let me issue and control a nation's
money and I care not who writes the laws."
1796
The First Bank of the United States has been controlling the
American money supply for 5 years. During this time the American
Government has borrowed $8,200,000 from this Central Bank, and prices in
the country have increased by 72%.
In relation to this, Thomas Jefferson,
then Secretary of State stated,
"I wish it were possible to obtain a
single amendment to our constitution taking from the Federal
Government their power of borrowing."
1798
Mayer Amschel Rothschild sends his son,
Nathan, at the age of 21, to England with a sum of money equivalent to
£20,000, to set up a money changers there.
1800
In France, the Bank of France was set
up. However Napoleon (below) decided France had to break free of
the debt and he therefore never trusted this bank. He declared that when
a government is dependent on bankers for money, it is the bankers and
not the government leaders that are in control.
He stated,
"The hand that gives is among the hand
that takes. Money has no motherland, financiers are without
patriotism and without decency, their sole object is gain."
1803
Now President Thomas Jefferson
(below), President Jefferson struck a deal with Napoleon in France. The
United States would give Napoleon $3,000,000 of gold in exchange for a
huge chunk of territory west of the Mississippi River. This was called
the Louisiana purchase.
Napoleon used this gold to put together an
army. He then used this army to set off across Europe where he began to
conquer everything in his path. The Bank of England quickly rose to
oppose Napoleon and financed every nation in his path, as usual
profiteering from war.
Prussia, Austria, and then finally Russia
all went heavily into debt in a futile attempt to stop Napoleon.
1807
30 year old Nathan Rothschild, head of the
English branch of the family in London, personally takes charge of a
plan to smuggle a much needed shipment of gold through France to Spain
to finance an attack by the Duke Of Wellington (below) on
Napoleon, from there.
1811
A bill was put before Congress to renew the
charter of the First Bank of the United States. The legislatures of both
Pennsylvania and Virginia pass resolutions asking Congress to kill the
bank. The national press openly attack the bank calling it: a great
swindle; a vulture; a viper; and a cobra.
Nathan Rothschild (above) gets in on
the act and makes the following revealing statement as to who was really
behind the First Bank of the United States,
Either the application for renewal of
the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself
involved in a most disastrous war.
When the smoke had cleared the renewal bill
was cleared by a single vote in the house and was deadlocked in the
Senate. At this point America's fourth President, President James
Madison was in the White House. He was a staunch opponent of the bank
and he sent his Vice-President, George Clinton (above), to break
a tie in the Senate which killed the bank.
1812
As promised by Nathan Rothschild, because
the charter for the First Bank of the United States is not renewed,
thousands have to die and the British attack America. However, as the
British are still busy fighting Napoleon, they are unable to mount much
of an assault and the war ends in 1814 with America undefeated.
1814
Wellington's attacks from the South and
other defeats eventually forced Napoleon to abdicate and Louis XVIII is
crowned King. Napoleon is exiled to the tiny island of Elba, off the
coast of Italy.
1815
Napoleon escapes his exile and returns to
Paris. French troops were sent to capture him, but he uses his charisma
to convince these soldiers to rally round him, and they subsequently
hail him as their emperor once again. In March, Napoleon assembles an
army which England's Duke of Wellington defeated less than 90 days later
at Waterloo.
Even though the outcome is predetermined, these bankers don't like to
take any sort of risk, they're too used to a monopoly. Therefore Nathan
Rothschild sent a trusted courier named Rothworth to Waterloo where he
stayed on the edge of the battlefield. Once the battle was decided,
Rothworth took off for the Channel, and delivered the news of
Wellington's victory to Nathan Rothschild a full 24 hours before
Wellington's own courier.
Nathan Rothschild hurried to the London Stock market and stood in
his usual position. All eyes were on him as Rothschild had a legendary
communications network. Rothschild stood there looking forlorn and
suddenly started selling. The other traders believed that this meant he
had heard that Napoleon had won so they all started selling frantically.
The market subsequently plummeted, soon everyone was selling their
consuls (British Government Bonds), but then Rothschild secretly started
buying them all up through his agents on the floor, for a fraction of
what they were worth only hours before. A lot of these consuls were able
to be converted to Bank of England stock, which is how Rothschild
took over the control of the Bank of England and therefore the
British money supply.
Interestingly, 100 years later, the New York Times ran a story
stating that Nathan Rothschild's grandson had attempted to secure a
court order to suppress a book with this, what we would call today,
"insider trading," story in it. The Rothschild family claimed the story
was untrue and libelous, but the court denied the Rothschilds request
and ordered the family to pay all court costs.
Nathan Rothschild openly brags that in his 17 years in England he had
increased his initial £20,000 stake given to him by his father, 2500
times to £50,000,000.
Some people ask, why do bankers want war? Simple, bankers finance
both sides in a war.
They do this because war is the biggest debt
generator of them all. A nation will borrow any amount for victory, even
though the banks have already predetermined the outcome. The ultimate
loser is loaned just enough money to hold out a vain hope of victory and
the ultimate winner is given enough to ensure that he does win.
How do the banks ensure they will get all their money back? Easy, such
loans are given on the guarantee that the victor will honor the debts of
the vanquished. Never mind the thousands of troops that give their lives
on the pretext it is for the honor of their respective nations, when it
is actually for the profits of bankers.
In fact, during the period between the founding of the Bank of England
in 1694 and Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo this year, England had been at
war for 56 years, with much of the remaining time spent preparing for
war. If it's a good business for bankers' profits, then why change it.
1816
The American Congress passes a bill
permitting yet another privately owned central bank. This bank
was called the, "Second Bank of the United States," and it's charter was
a carbon copy of that of its predecessor, the First Bank of the United
States. The United States government would once again supposedly own 20%
of the shares of the bank.
Second Bank of the United
States
Their share was again paid up front into the
bank and thanks to fraudulent fractional reserve lending, this was
transformed into loans to the private investors who once again purchased
the remaining 80% of the shares. Just as before the names of these
investors was kept a secret.
1826
The talley stick is taken out of circulation
in England.
1828
After 12 years during which the Second Bank
of the United States, ruthlessly manipulated the American economy to the
detriment of the people but to the benefit of their own money grabbing
ends, the American people had unsurprisingly had enough.
Opponents of this bank nominated Senator
Andrew Jackson (above) of Tennessee to run for President.
To the dismay of the money changers, Jackson won the Presidency and made
it quite clear he intended to kill this bank at his first opportunity.
He started out during his first term in office, to root out the banks
many minions from government service. To illustrate how deep this cancer
was rooted in government, he fired 2,000 of the 11,000 employees of the
Federal Government.
1832
The Second Bank of the United States, ask Congress to pass a
renewal of the bank's charter, four years early. Congress complied and
sent the bill to President Jackson for signing.
President Jackson vetoed this bill and in
his veto message he stated the following,
"It is not our own citizens only who are
to receive the bounty of our Government. More than eight millions of
the stock of the Bank are held by foreigners... Is there no danger
to out liberty and independence in a bank that in its nature has so
little to bind it to our country?
Controlling our currency, receiving our public moneys, and holding
thousands of our citizens in dependence ...would be more formidable
and dangerous than a military power of the enemy. If government
would confine itself to equal protection, and, as Heaven does its
rains, shower the favor alike on the high and the low, the rich and
the poor, it would be an unqualified blessing.
In the act before me there seems to be wide and unnecessary
departure from these just principles."
In July, Congress was unable to override
President Jackson's veto. President Jackson then stood for re-election
and for the first time in American history he took his argument directly
to the people by taking his re-election campaign on the road.
His campaign slogan was, "Jackson And No
Bank!"
Even though the bankers poured over $3,000,000 into President Jackson's
opponent, the Republican, Senator Henry Clays' campaign, President
Jackson was re-elected by a landslide in November. President Jackson
knew the battle was only beginning however, and following his victory he
stated,
"The hydra of corruption is only
scotched, not dead!"
1833
President Jackson appoints Roger B. Taney
(below) as Secretary of State for the Treasury, with instructions to
start removing the government's deposits from the Second Bank of the
United States. President Jackson's previous two Secretaries of State for
the Treasury, William J. Duane and Louis McLane had both refused to
comply with President Jackson's request and were fired as a result.
However
the head of the, Second Bank of the United States, Nicholas Biddle
(right), used his influence to get the Senate to reject Roger B. Taney's
nomination and even threatened to cause a depression if the Bank was not
re-chartered.
Biddle stated,
"This worthy President thinks that
because he has scalped Indians and imprisoned judges, he is to have
his way with the Bank. He is mistaken."
Biddle then went on to brazenly admit that
the bank was intending to make money scarce in order to force the hand
of Congress into re-chartering the bank.
He stated,
"Nothing but widespread suffering will
produce any effect on Congress... Our only safety is pursuing a
steady course of firm restriction - and I have no doubt that such a
course will ultimately lead to restoration of the currency and
re-charter of the Bank."
What Biddle has done with that statement is
prove to the world what central banks were really about. He made good on
his word, and the Second Bank of the United States, sharply contracted
the money supply by calling in old loans and refusing to issue new ones.
Naturally a financial panic ensued, followed
by America being plunged into a deep depression.
Biddle then unashamedly blamed President Jackson for the crash, claiming
that it was Jackson's withdrawal of federal funds that had caused it.
This crash plunged wages and prices, unemployment soared along with
business bankruptcies. The United States was in uproar and newspaper
editors blasted the President in editorials.
1835
Congress assembled what was called the, "Panic Session," and on 27
March President Jackson was officially censured by Congress for
withdrawing funds from the Second Bank of the United States, in a vote
which passed the Senate by 26 to 20.
It was the first time a President had ever
been censured by Congress and Jackson stated of the Bank,
"You are a den of thieves vipers, and I
intend to rout you out, and by the Eternal God, I will rout
you out."
However,
Pennsylvania Governor, George Wolf (right), came out in support
of President Jackson and strongly criticized the Bank. This, coupled
with the fact that Nicholas Biddle had been caught boasting in public
about the bank's plan to crash the American economy, caused a shift in
opinion of President Jackson's action.
In a complete about turn on April 4, the House of Representatives voted
134 to 82 against re-chartering the bank. This was followed by another
strong vote which established a special committee to investigate whether
the Bank had caused the crash.
However, when the investigating committee arrived at the bank's door in
Philadelphia with a subpoena authorizing them to inspect the books,
Nicholas Biddle refused to give them up, or allow inspection of
correspondence with Congressmen relating to their personal loans and
advancements he had made to them. He also refused to testify before the
committee back in Washington.
1836
The Charter for the Second Bank of the
United States expires, and the Bank ceases functioning as America's
central bank. Nicholas Biddle was later arrested and charged with fraud.
He was tried and acquitted but died in 1844 still battling civil suits.
1838
On January 8th President Jackson pays off
the final installment of the national debt, which had been necessitated
by allowing the banks to issue currency for government bonds, rather
than simply issuing treasury notes without such debt. He was the only
President to ever pay off the debt.
On January 30th an assassin called Richard Lawrence (right) tried to shoot
President Jackson, but both pistols misfired. Lawrence was later found
not guilty by reason of insanity. However, after his release he openly
bragged that powerful people in Europe had put him up to the task and
promised to protect him if he were caught.
When asked what his most important accomplishment had been in life,
President Jackson stated without hesitation,
"I killed the Bank!"
It would take the money changers 75 years to
establish the next central bank, the Federal Reserve. This time they
would take no chances and use one of their own, Jacob Schiff,
from the Rothschild bloodline, to undertake this.
1850
Jacob (James) Rothschild in France is said
to be worth 600 million francs, which at the time was 150 million francs
more than all the other bankers in France put together.
1852
Future British Prime Minister, William Gladstone (below), stated the
following about when he became Chancellor of the Exchequer this year,
"From the time I took office as
Chancellor of the Exchequer, I began to learn that the State held,
in the face of the Bank and the City, an essentially false position
as to finance. The Government itself was not to be a substantive
power, but was to leave the Money Power supreme and unquestioned."
1861
One month after the inauguration of President Abraham Lincoln
(right),
the American Civil War got underway at Fort Sumter, South Carolina,
after South Carolina left the Union.
Slavery has always been cited as the cause
of the war but this was simply not the case, as President Lincoln
himself stated,
"I have no purpose directly or
indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the state
where it now exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and
I have no inclination to do so... My paramount objective is to save
the Union and it is not either to save or destroy slavery. If I
could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it."
The real reason for the war is that the
Southern States were in an a dire economic situation due to the actions
of the Northern States. Northern
industrialists had used trade tariffs
to prevent the Southern States from buying cheaper European goods.
Europe subsequently retaliated by stopping cotton imports from the
South. Thus the South were being forced to pay more for goods whilst
having their income slashed.
This is when the money changers saw the opportunity to divide and
conquer America by plunging it into Civil War.
This is confirmed by Otto Von Bismarck
(right)
when he was Chancellor of Germany (1871 - 1890), who stated,
"The division of the United States into
federations of equal force was decided long before the Civil War by
the high financial powers of Europe, these bankers were afraid that
the United States if they remained as one block and as one nation,
would attain economic and financial independence which would upset
their financial domination over the world."
Only months after these first shots in South
Carolina, the Central bankers loaned, Napoleon III (right) of France (the
Napoleon of the battle of Waterloo's nephew), 210 million francs to
seize Mexico and then station troops along the Southern border of the
United States, by taking advantage of the American Civil War to return
Mexico to colonial rule.
This was in violation of the, "Monroe Doctrine," which was issued by
President James Monroe during his seventh annual State of the
Union address to Congress, in 1823. This doctrine proclaimed the United
States' opinion that European powers should no longer colonize the
Americas or interfere with the affairs of sovereign nations located in
the Americas, such as the United States, Mexico, and others.
In return, the United States planned to stay neutral in wars between
European powers and in wars between a European power and its colonies.
However, if these latter type of wars were to occur in the Americas, the
U.S. would view such action as hostile toward itself.
Whilst the French were breaching the, Monroe Doctrine in Mexico, the
British followed suit by moving 11,000 troops into Canada and
positioning them along America's Northern border. President Lincoln knew
he was in trouble, so he went with his Secretary To The Treasury,
Salomon P. Chase, to New York to apply for the loans necessary to fund
America's defense.
The money changers had engineered the war to make the Union fail, and
were not about to save it now, so they offered loans at 24% to 36%
interest. President Lincoln declined this as they knew he would and
returned to Washington, where he sent for Colonel Dick Taylor
(below-right) of
Chicago, who he put in charge of the problem of how he should finance
the war.
During one meeting President Lincoln asked Colonel Taylor what proposals
he had come up with to finance the war. Colonel Taylor stated,
"Why Lincoln, that is easy, just get
Congress to pass a bill authorizing the printing of full legal
tender treasury notes...and pay your soldiers with them and go ahead
and win your war with them also."
President Lincoln asked Colonel Taylor if
the people of the United States would accept the notes, Colonel Taylor
said,
"The people or anyone else will not have
any choice in the matter, if you make them full legal tender. They
will have the full sanction of the government and be just as good as
any money, as Congress is given that express right by the
Constitution."
1862
President Lincoln began the printing of $450,000,000 worth of new
bills. These bills were printed in green ink on the reverse side, in
order to distinguish them from other bills in circulation, and were
called, "Greenbacks" (below). These were printed at no interest to the Federal
Government and were used to pay the troops and purchase their supplies.
President Lincoln would be the last
President to issue debt free United States notes, and on this subject he
stated,
"The Government should create, issue and
circulate all the currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending
power of the Government and the buying power of consumers. The
privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme
prerogative of Government, but it is in the Government's greatest
creative opportunity. By the adoption of these principles...the
taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest. Money will cease
to be master and become the servant of humanity."
In response to this statement, The Times
of London publishes a propaganda piece obviously put out by the bankers,
containing the following statement,
"If that mischievous financial policy,
which had its origin in the North American Republic, should become
indurated down to a fixture, then that government will furnish its
own money without cost. It will pay off debts and be without a debt.
It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce.
It will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of
civilized governments of the world. The brains and the wealth of all
countries will go to North America. That government must be
destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe."
1863
The bankers struck back. With President
Lincoln needing further congressional authority to issue more
Greenbacks, Lincoln was forced into allowing the bankers to push their,
"National Banking Act," through Congress.
The most important part of this Act was that from now on, the entire
United States money supply would be created out of debt by the National
Banks buying United States Government Bonds and issuing them for
reserves for banknotes. On top of this monopoly, the National Banks were
allowed to operate under a virtual tax free status.
This banking scam is best explained by
historian, John Kenneth Galbraith, who stated,
"In numerous years following the war,
the Federal Government ran a heavy surplus. It could not however pay
off its debt, retire its securities, because to do so meant there
would be no bonds to back the national bank notes. To pay off the
debt was to destroy the money supply."
Later this year, Tsar Alexander II
(right) gave
President Lincoln some unexpected help. The Tsar issued orders that if
either England or France actively intervened in the American Civil War,
and help the South, Russia would consider such action a declaration of
war. To show that he wasn't messing about, he sent part of his Pacific
Fleet to port in San Francisco.
This wasn't because the Tsar was benevolent towards America, instead he
was very clever. He, like Otto Von Bismarck in Germany, could clearly
see what the money changers were up to, indeed he had already refused to
let them set up a Central Bank in Russia.
He understood if America was to come under
the control of Britain or France, then America would be under the
control of Central Bankers once again, and such an expansion of the
bankers empire, would mean they would eventually threaten Russia.
1864
President Lincoln is re-elected on November 8th and on November 21
he wrote a friend the following,
"The money power preys upon the nations
in times of peace and conspires against it in times of adversity. It
is more despotic than monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, more
selfish than bureaucracy."
Salomon P. Chase (right), now President
Lincoln's Former Secretary To The Treasury, stated,
"My agency in promoting the passage of
the National Banking Act was the greatest financial mistake in my
life. It has built up a monopoly which affects every interest in the
country."
1865
On April 14th, 41 days after his second
inauguration, and just 5 days after General Lee surrendered to General
Grant at Appomattox, President Lincoln is shot by John Wilkes Booth, at
Ford's Theater. He would later die of his injuries. Subsequent
allegations that international bankers were responsible for President
Lincoln's assassination, would be made in the Canadian House of Commons,
nearly 70 years later in 1934.
The person who revealed this was a Canadian Attorney, Gerald G.
McGeer. He had obtained evidence deleted from the public record
provided to him by Secret Service Agents at the trial of John Wilkes
Booth (right), after Booth's death. McGeer stated that it showed that John
Wilkes Booth was a mercenary working for the international bankers.
His speech would be reported in an article
in the Vancouver Sun, dated, 2nd May 1934, which stated,
"Abraham Lincoln, the murdered
emancipator of the slaves, was assassinated through the machinations
of a group representative of the International Bankers, who feared
the United States President's National Credit ambitions. There was
only one group in the world at that time who had any reason to
desire the death of Lincoln. They were the men opposed to his
national currency program and who had fought him throughout the
whole Civil War on his policy of Greenback currency."
Gerald G. McGeer also stated that Lincoln's
assassination was not purely because the International Bankers wanted to
re-establish a central bank in America, but also because they wanted to
base America's currency on gold, which they of course controlled. They
wanted to put America on a Gold Standard. This was in direct opposition
to President Lincoln's policy of issuing Greenbacks, based solely on the
good faith and credit of the United States.
The Vancouver Sun article also quoted Gerald G. McGeer with the
following statement,
"They were the men interested in the
establishment of the Gold Standard and the right of the bankers to
manage the currency and credit of every nation in the world. With
Lincoln out of the way they were able to proceed with that plan and
did proceed with it in the United States. Within 8 years after
Lincoln's assassination, silver was demonetized and the Gold
Standard system set up in the United States."
1866
The European central bankers wanted the
re-institution of a central bank under their control and an American
currency backed by gold. They chose gold as gold has always been
relatively scarce and therefore a lot easier to monopolize, than, for
example, silver, which was plentiful in the United States, and had been
found in huge quantities with the opening of the American West.
So, on April 12th, Congress went back to work at the bidding of the
European central bankers. It passed the, "Contraction Act," which
authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to contract the money supply by
retiring some of the Greenbacks in circulation.
This money contraction and it's disastrous results is explained by
Theodore R. Thoren and Richard F. Walker, in their book, "The
Truth In Money Book," in which they state the following,
"The hard times which occurred after the
Civil War could have been avoided if the Greenback legislation had
continued as President Lincoln had intended. Instead there were a
series of money panics, what we call recessions, which put pressure
on Congress to enact legislation to place the banking system under
centralized control. Eventually the Federal Reserve Act was passed
on December 23rd 1913."
This is how the, "Contraction Act," passed
by Congress affected America (the money supply goes down purely because
currency in circulation is being withdrawn):
Therefore in the twenty years since 1866 two thirds of the American
money supply had been called in by the bankers, representing a 760% loss
in buying power over this twenty years. The money became scarce simply
because bank loans were called in and no new ones were given.
1872
Ernest Seyd is sent to America on a
mission from the Rothschild owned Bank of England. He is given $100,000
which he is to use to bribe as many Congressmen as necessary, for the
purposes of getting silver demonetized, as it had been found in huge
quantities in the American West, which would eat into Rothschild's
profits.
1873
Ernest Seyd obviously spent his money
wisely, as Congress pass the, "Coinage Act," which results in the
minting of silver dollars being abruptly stopped. Furthermore,
Representative Samuel Hooper, who introduced the bill in the
house, even admitted that Ernest Seyd had actually drafted the
legislation.
1874
Ernest Seyd himself admitted who was behind the demonetizing of
silver in America, when he makes the following statement,
"I went to America in the winter of 1872
- 1873, authorized to secure, if I could, the passage of a bill
demonetizing silver. It was in the interests of those I represented,
the governors of the Bank Of England, to have it done. By 1873, gold
coins were the only form of coin money."
1876
Due to the manipulation of the money supply
in America, one third of the workforce is unemployed and unrest is
growing. There are even calls for a return to Greenback money or silver
money. As a result, Congress creates the, "United States Silver
Commission," to investigate the problem.
This commission clearly understood that the national bankers were the
cause of the problem, with their deliberate contraction of the money
supply.
An excerpt of their report reads as follows,
"The disaster of the Dark Ages was
caused by decreasing money and falling prices ...Without money,
civilization could not have had a beginning, and with a diminishing
supply, it must languish, and unless relieved, finally perish. At
the Christian era the metallic money of the Roman Empire amounted to
$1,800,000,000. By the end of the 15th century it had shrunk to less
than $200,000,000...History records no other such disastrous
transition as that from the Roman Empire to the Dark Ages..."
Despite this damning report from the
commission, Congress took no action.
1877
Rioting breaks out from Pittsburgh to
Chicago. The bankers get together to decide what to do and they decided
to hang on, as they knew that despite the violence, they were now firmly
back in control. At the meeting of the American Bankers Association,
they urged their membership to do everything in their power, to put down
any notion of a return to Greenbacks.
The American Bankers Association secretary, James Buel, even
wrote a letter to the members in which he blatantly called on the banks
to subvert both Congress and the press.
In this letter he stated,
"It is advisable to do all in your power
to sustain such prominent daily and weekly newspapers, especially
the Agricultural and Religious Press, as well as oppose the
Greenback issue of paper money and that you will also withhold
patronage from all applicants who are not willing to oppose the
government issue of money....
...To repeal the Act creating bank notes, or to restore to
circulation issue of money will be to provide the people with money
and will therefore seriously affect our individual profits as
bankers and lenders. See your Congressman at once and engage him to
support our interests that we may control legislation."
1878
James Buel's letter clearly had some effect, as although pressure
mounted in Congress for change, the press tried to turn the general
public away from the truth. An example of this is from the New York
Tribune in their 10th January edition in which is stated in a bankers
propaganda piece,
"The capital of the country is organized
at last and we will see whether Congress will dare to fly in its
face."
This early control of the media didn't work
entirely nevertheless, as on February 28th Congress passed the, "Sherman
Law." This law allowed the minting of a limited number of silver
dollars, ending the 5 year hiatus. However this did not mean that anyone
who brought silver to the United States Mint could have it struck into
silver dollars, free of charge, as in the period prior to Ernest Seyd's
Coinage Act, in 1873.
Gold backing of the American currency also
remained.
However, this Sherman Law did ensure that some money began to
flow into the economy again, and coupled with the fact that the bankers
now realized that they were still firmly in control, they started
issuing loans again and the post Civil War depression was finally over.
1881
The American people elect the Republican, James Garfield
(right) as
the 20th President of the United States. This was a worry to the money
changers, because as a Congressman, he had been Chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, and was a member of Banking and Currency. The
money changers were therefore aware that President Garfield was in full
knowledge of their scam on the American people.
Indeed following his inauguration, President
Garfield stated,
"Whosoever controls the volume of money
in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce...
And when you realize that the entire system is very easily
controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top,
you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression
originate."
Strangely enough within a few weeks of
making that statement, President Garfield was assassinated on 2nd July.
1891
The money changers spent the last decade creating economic booms
followed by depressions, so that they could buy up thousands of homes
and farms for pennies on the dollar.
They were preparing to take the economy down
again in the near future, and in a shocking memo sent out by the
American Bankers Association, which would come out in the Congressional
Record more than twenty years later, the following is stated,
"On September 1st 1894 we will not renew
our loans under any consideration. On September 1st we will demand
our money. We will foreclose and become mortgages in possession. We
can take two-thirds of the farms west of the Mississippi, and
thousands of them east of the Mississippi as well, at our own
price... Then the farmers will become tenants as in England...,"
1891 American Bankers Association, as
printed in the Congressional Record of April 29, 1913.
1896
The central issue in the Presidential campaign is the issue of more
silver money. Senator William Jennings Bryan (right) from Nebraska, a
Democrat aged only 36, makes an emotional speech at the Democratic
National Convention in Chicago, entitled, "Crown Of Thorns And Cross Of
Gold." Senator Bryan stated,
"We will answer their demand for a gold
standard by saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow
of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a
cross of gold."
The bankers naturally supported the
Republican candidate, William McKinley who in return favored the
gold standard. Furthermore those in the McKinley campaign, got
manufacturers and industrialists to inform their employees that if Bryan
were elected, all factories and plants would close and there would be no
work.
This tactic succeeded, McKinley beat Bryan, albeit by a small margin.
1898
Pope Leo XIII (right) stated the following on the subject of usury,
"On the one hand there is the party
which holds the power because it holds the wealth, which has in its
grasp all labor and all trade, which manipulates for its own benefit
and its own purposes all the sources of supply, and which is
powerfully represented in the councils of State itself. On the other
side there is the needy and powerless multitude, sore and suffering.
Rapacious usury, which, although more than once condemned by
the
Church, is nevertheless under a different form but with the same
guilt, still practiced by avaricious and grasping men... so that a
small number of very rich men have been able to lay upon the masses
of the poor a yoke little better than slavery itself."
1907
During the early 1900's, the money changers were anxious to advance
their business of setting up another private Central Bank for America.
Rothschild, Jacob Schiff, the head of Kuhn,
Loeb and Co., in a speech to the New York Chamber of Commerce, stated,
or rather threatened,
Unless we have a Central Bank with
adequate control of credit resources, this country is going to
undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its
history.
They put Rothschild agent, J. P. Morgan
(right)
at the forefront of their charge. Interestingly J. P. Morgan's father,
Julius Morgan, had been America's financial agent to the British, and
after Julius' death, J. P. Morgan took on a British partner, Edward
Grenville, who was a long time director of the Bank Of England.
This year was the year of the money changers attack. J. P. Morgan and
his cohorts secretly crashed the stock market. They were aware that
thousands of small banks were so vastly over extended, some only had
reserves of 1% under the fraudulent fractional reserve principle. Within
only a few days, bank runs became commonplace across the nation.
Morgan then stepped up and publicly announced that he would support
these failing banks. What he failed to mention is that he would do this
by manufacturing money out of nothing. And then what happened,
surprise, surprise, Congress let him do it! So, Morgan manufactured
$200,000,000 of this completely reserveless private money, purchased
goods and services with it, and sent some of it to his branch banks to
lend out at interest.
As a result, the general public regained confidence in money, but most
importantly it meant the banking power was now further consolidated into
the hands of a few large banks.
1908
With the widespread financial panic over, J. P. Morgan was hailed as
a hero by the then President of Princeton University, Woodrow Wilson
(right),
who even crassly or arrogantly stated,
"All this trouble could be averted if we
appointed a committee of six or seven public spirited men like J. P.
Morgan, to handle the affairs of our country."
President Theodore Roosevelt had also signed
into law, following the financial panic, a bill creating the, "National
Monetary Commission."
This commission was supposed to study the banking problem and make
recommendations to Congress. Naturally, the commission was packed with
J. P. Morgan's friends and cronies.
The chairman was Senator Nelson Aldrich
(right) from Rhode Island, and he
represented the Newport Rhode Island homes of America's richest banking
families. His daughter married John D. Rockefeller Jr., and
together they had five sons (including Nelson who would become Vice
President in 1974 and David who would become Head of the
Council on Foreign Relations).
Following the setting up of this National Monetary Commission, Senator
Aldrich immediately embarked on a 2 year fact finding tour of Europe,
where he consulted at length with the private central bankers in
England, France, and Germany, or rather Rothschild, Rothschild,
and Rothschild.
The total cost of this 2 year trip to the American taxpayer? $300,000.
Yes, three hundred thousand dollars, that is not a misprint!
1910
Jekyll Island
Senator Aldrich returns from his two year
European fact finding mission on 22nd November. Shortly afterwards some
of America's most wealthy and powerful men boarded Senator Aldrich's
private railcar in the strictest secrecy.
They journeyed to
Jekyll
Island off the coast of Georgia.
In this group were
Paul Warburg (above), who was earning a $500,000 a
year salary from Rothschild owned firm, Kuhn, Loeb & Company.
This salary was for him to lobby for a privately owned central bank in
America.
Also present was Jacob Schiff (right), a Rothschild who had
purchased Kuhn, Loeb and Company shortly after he arrived in America
from England.
The Rothschilds, Warburgs and Schiffs, interconnected by marriage, were
essentially the same family.
Secrecy at this meeting was so tight that all the participants were
cautioned to use only first names, to prevent servants from learning
their identities.
Years later, one participant, Frank Vanderlip
(right), President of National Citibank and a representative of the Rockefeller
family, confirmed the Jekyll Island trip in a 9th February 1935 edition
of the Saturday Evening Post in which he stated,
"I was as secretive indeed, as furtive
as any conspirator ...Discovery we knew, simply must not happen, or
else all our time and effort would be wasted. If it were to be
exposed that our particular group had got together and written a
banking bill, that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by
Congress."
It was not just the setting up of a Central
Bank that was on the agenda. Other problems for these bankers were that
the market share of these big national banks was shrinking fast. In the
first ten years of the century the number of United States banks had
more than doubled to over 20,000.
By 1913 only 29% of all banks were national
banks and they held only 57% of all deposits.
As John D. Rockefeller put it,
"Competition is Sin!"
Senator Aldrich later admitted in a magazine
article,
"Before passage of this Act, the New
York Bankers could only dominate the reserves of New York. Now we
are able to dominate bank reserves of the entire country."
So one of the aims of these conspirators was
to bring these new banks under their control. Secondly the nations
economy was so strong that corporations were starting to finance their
own expansions out of profits instead of taking out huge loans from
large banks. Indeed, in the first ten years of the century, 70% of
corporate funding came from profits.
Basically, American Industry was becoming independent of the money
changers, and the money changers were not about to let that happen.
There was also much discussion regarding the name of the new bank, which
took place in a conference room in the Jekyll Island Club Hotel. Aldrich
believed the word, "bank," should not even appear in the name. Warburg
wanted to call the legislation, the, "National Reserve Bill," or the,
"Federal Reserve Bill." The idea was not only to give the impression
that the purpose of the new central bank was to stop bank runs, but also
to conceal its monopoly character.
However it was Senator Aldrich, the egomaniac, who insisted it be called
the, "Aldrich Bill." So, after nine days at Jekyll Island, the group
dispersed. This group of conspirators immediately set up an educational
fund of $5,000,000 to finance Professors at top universities to endorse
the new bank.
The new central bank would be very similar to the old Bank Of The
United States, in that it would be given a monopoly over United
States currency and create that money out of nothing. Also in order to
make the public think it was under control of the Government, the plan
called for the central bank to be run by a board of governors appointed
by the President and approved by the Senate.
This would not cause any undue problems for the bankers, as they knew
they could use their money to buy influence over the politicians, in
order to ensure the men they wanted got appointed to the board of
governors.
1912
The Aldrich bill is presented to Congress for debate. This was very
quickly identified as a bill to benefit the bankers, or an expression
for them which was coined at the time, "The Money Trust."
During the debate, the Republican,
Charles A. Lindbergh (right) stated,
"The Aldrich plan is the Wall Street
Plan. It means another panic, if necessary, to intimidate the
people. Aldrich, paid by the government to represent the people,
proposes a plan for the trusts instead."
As this debate continued on, the bankers
realized they didn't have enough support, so the Republican leadership
never brought the Aldrich bill to a vote. Instead the bankers decided to
switch their attention to the Democrats and started heavily financing
Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic Presidential nominee.
The Wall Street banker, Bernard Baruch
(right), was put in charge of the Wilson project, and as historian, James
Perloff, stated,
"Baruch brought Wilson to the Democratic
Party headquarters in New York in 1912, 'leading him like one wood a
poodle on a string.' Wilson received an, 'indoctrination course,'
from the leaders convened there...."
During the Democratic Presidential campaign,
Wilson and the rulers of the Democratic Party pretended to oppose the
Aldrich bill. As Republican representative, Louis T. McFadden
(below-right), explained twenty years later, when he was was Chairman Of The House
Banking And Currency Committee,
"The Aldrich Bill was condemned in the
platform... when Woodrow Wilson was nominated... The men who ruled
the Democratic Party promised the people that if they were returned
to power there would be no central bank established here while they
held the reins of government.
Thirteen months later that promise was broken, and the Wilson
administration, under the tutelage of those sinister Wall Street
figures who stood behind Colonel House, established here in our free
country the worm-eaten monarchical institution of the, 'King's
Bank,' to control us from the top downward, and to shackle us from
the cradle to the grave."
On November 5th, Woodrow Wilson was
elected, and J. P. Morgan, Paul Warburg, Bernard Baruch et al, advanced
a new plan which Warburg called the Federal Reserve System. The
leadership of the Democratic Party hailed this new bill called the,
"Glass-Owen Bill," as totally different to the Aldrich bill, when in
fact it was virtually identical.
Funnily enough the Democrats were so vehement in their denial of the
similarity of the, "Glass-Owen Bill," to the, "Aldrich Bill," that Paul
Warburg, the creator of both bill, had to inform his paid friends in
Congress, that the two bills were virtually identical and therefore they
must vote to pass it.
Warburg stated,
"Brushing aside the external differences
affecting the, 'shells,' we find the, 'kernels,' of the two systems
very closely resembling and related to one another."
However this admission by Warburg was not
made public. Instead, Senator Aldrich, and Frank Vanderlip, the
President of Rockefeller's National Citibank of New York, were to
publicly state their opposition to the bill in order to make people
think that the bill proposed was radically different to the Aldrich
bill.
Indeed, Frank Vanderlip stated years
later in the Saturday Evening Post,
"Although the Aldrich Federal Reserve
Plan was defeated when it bore the name Aldrich, nevertheless its
essential points were all contained in the plan that finally was
adopted."
1913
With Congress nearing a vote on the
Glass-Owen Bill, they called Ohio Attorney, Alfred Crozier, to testify.
However, Crozier noticed the similarities between the Aldrich Bill and
the Glass-Owen Bill, and subsequently stated,
"The...bill grants just what Wall Street
and the big banks for twenty-five years have been striving for -
private instead of public control of currency. It (the Glass-Owen
bill) does this as completely as the Aldrich bill. Both measures rob
the government and the people of all effective control over the
public's money, and vest in the banks exclusively the dangerous
power to make money among the people scarce or plenty."
The debate on this bill was not going well
for the banks, with many Senators intimating the bill was corrupt and
deceitful, however the bill was approved through the Senate on December
22nd. How did this happen? Because most of the Senators had left town to
return home for the Christmas holidays. Furthermore, these Senators had
been assured by the leadership, that nothing would be done regarding
this bill until long after the Christmas recess.
Representative Charles A Lindbergh Sr. stated,
"This Act establishes the most gigantic
trust on earth. When the President signs this bill, the invisible
government of the monetary power will be legalized. The people may
not know it immediately, but the day of reckoning is only a few
years removed... The worst legislative crime of the ages is
perpetrated by this banking and currency bill."
Interestingly, only a few weeks earlier, in
October, Congress finally passed a bill legalizing direct income tax of
the people. This was in the form of a bill pushed through by Senator
Aldrich, which is now commonly known as the 16th amendment. The income
tax law was fundamental to the Federal Reserve.
This is because
the Federal Reserve was a system
which would run up, essentially, an unlimited Federal debt.
The only way to guarantee the payment of interest on this debt was to
directly tax the people, as they had done with the Bank Of England. If
the Federal Reserve had to rely on contributions from the States, they
would be dealing with bigger entities, who could revolt and refuse to
pay the interest on their own money, or at least bring political
pressure to bear in order to keep the debt small.
Actually, this 16th amendment was never ratified, and therefore many
American citizens do not pay their income tax and there is nothing the
United States Government can do about it. For further information on
this go to
thelawthatneverwas.com. Also, back in
1895, the Supreme Court had also found an income tax law similar to the
16th amendment, as unconstitutional. The Supreme Court also found a
Corporate Tax Law unconstitutional in 1909.
Another important amendment that was put through this year is the 17th
amendment. This provided for the direct election by the people of two
Senators from each state as oppose to the original system of having
state legislatures elect United States Senators. More democratic, you
would think, until you realize these bankers could now provide the funds
for their hand picked people to run for the Senate, and thus avoid
future problems like getting the Federal Reserve through the Senate.
Anyway, back to the Federal Reserve, if you are in any doubt as to
whether the Federal Reserve is a private company, a basic check the
public can carry out is in their phone book. Look under the government
pages and it is not listed, but you will find it listed within the
business pages.
Actually some recent evidence has come forward as to
who really owns
the Federal Reserve, and they are the following banks:
-
Rothschild Bank of London
-
Warburg Bank of Hamburg
-
Rothschild Bank of Berlin
-
Lehman Brothers of New York
-
Lazard Brothers of Paris
-
Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York
-
Israel Moses Seif Banks of Italy
-
Goldman, Sachs of New York
-
Warburg Bank of Amsterdam
-
Chase Manhattan Bank of New York
Also some argue that the Federal Reserve is
a quasi-governmental agency, yet the President appoints only 2 of
the 7 members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, every four
years, and he appoints them to 14 year terms, which is far longer than
any term he could possibly serve as President.
The Senate confirms these
appointments, but as we have seen, that is the idea, because these are
the very people hand picked by the bankers who also finance their
campaigns, ensuring loyalty to them, not the people.
Let's summarize how the Federal Reserve creates money out of nothing. It
is a four step process:
-
The Federal Open Market Committee
approves the purchase of United States Bonds*.
-
The bonds are purchased by the Federal
Reserve.
-
The Federal Reserve pays for these bonds
with electronic credits to the seller's bank, these credits are
based on nothing.
-
The banks use these deposits as
reserves. They can loan out over ten times the amount of their
reserves to new borrowers, all at interest.
* Bonds are
simply promises to pay or Government IOU's. People purchase bonds in
order to get a secure rate of interest. At the end of the term of the
bond, the government repays the bond, plus interest and the bond is
destroyed.
Let's look at an example of how this works with a Federal Reserve
purchase of $1,000,000 of bonds. This then gets turned into over
$10,000,000 in bank accounts. The Federal Reserve in effect creates 10%
of this totally new $10,000,000 and the banks create the other 90%.
To reduce the amount of money in circulation this process is simply
reversed.
The Federal Reserve sells these bonds to the public and the
money flows out of the purchaser's local bank. Loans must be reduced by
ten times the amount of the sale, so a Federal Reserve sale of
$1,000,000 in bonds, results in $10,000,000 less money in the economy.
How does this benefit the bankers, whose
representatives met at Jekyll Island?
-
It prevented any future banking reform
efforts, as the Federal Reserve was to be the only producer of
money.
-
This in turn prevented a proper debt
free system of government finance, like President Lincoln's
Greenbacks, from making a comeback. Instead, the bond based system
of government finance, forced on Lincoln after he created
Greenbacks, was now cast in stone.
-
It delegated to the bankers the right to
create 90% of our money supply based on a fraudulent system of
fractional reserve banking and allowed them to loan out that 90% at
interest.
-
It centralized overall control of our
nations money supply in the hands of and for the profits of a few
men.
-
It established a private central bank
with a high degree of independence from effective political control.
1914
The start of World War I. In this war, the
German Rothschilds loaned money to the Germans, the British Rothschilds
loaned money to the British, and the French Rothschilds loaned money to
the French.
One year after the passage of the Federal Reserve Bill, Representative
Charles A Lindbergh Sr., outlined how The Federal Reserve created
the, "business cycle," and how they manipulated that to their own
advantage.
He stated,
"To cause high prices, all the Federal
Reserve Board will do will be to lower the rediscount rate...,
producing an expansion of credit and a rising stock market, then
when ...business men are adjusted to these conditions, it can
check... prosperity in mid-career by arbitrarily raising the rate of
interest.
It can cause the pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing
gently back and forth by slight changes in the discount rate, or
cause violent fluctuations by a greater rate variation, and in
either case it will possess inside information as to financial
conditions and advance knowledge of the coming change, either up or
down. This is the strongest, most dangerous advantage ever placed in
the hands of a special privilege class by any Government that ever
existed.
The system is private, conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining
the greatest possible profits from the use of other people's money.
They know in advance when to create panics to their advantage. They
also know when to stop panic. Inflation and deflation work equally
well for them when they control finance."
1915
J. P. Morgan became the sales agent
for the, "War Materials Board," to both the British and the French
engaged in World War I, and becomes the biggest consumer on the planet,
spending 10 million dollars a day. Furthermore, President Woodrow Wilson
appointed banker, Bernard Baruch, to head the, "War Industries
Board."
According to historian, James Perloff, both Bernard Baruch and the
Rockefellers profited by approximately 200 million dollars during World
War I.
A lot of people believe the key to an effective money supply is to
ensure it is backed by something of worth such as gold. However, who do
you think would control that gold?
As Republican, Charles A. Lindbergh stated
this year,
"Already the Federal Reserve Banks have
cornered the gold and gold certificates."
1916
President Wilson began to realize the gravity of the damage he had
done to America, by unleashing the Federal Reserve on the American
people.
He stated,
"We have come to be one of the worst
ruled, one of the most completely controlled governments in the
civilized world - no longer a government of free opinion, no longer
a government by ...a vote of the majority, but a government by the
opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.
Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of
commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know there
is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so
interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not
speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it."
1917
The money changers never forgave the Tsars
of Russia for both continually opposing their request to set up a
central bank in Russia, as well as their support of President Lincoln
during the Civil War. Therefore, Jacob Schiff, a Rothschild,
spent 20 million dollars through his firm, Kuhn, Loeb & Co., in
financing the Russian Revolution.
It is commonly believed that Communism is the opposite of Capitalism, so
why would these capitalists support it?
Respected researcher, Gary Allen,
explains it as follows,
"If one understands that socialism is
not a share-the-wealth program, but it is in reality a method to
consolidate and control the wealth, then the seeming paradox of
super-rich men promoting socialism becomes no paradox at all.
Instead it becomes logical, even the perfect tool of power seeking
megalomaniacs. Communism, or more accurately socialism, is not a
movement of the downtrodden masses, but of the economic elite."
1919
In January the Paris Peace Conference takes
place following the end of World War I. The bankers put World Government
at the top of their agenda, and Paul Warburg and Bernard Baruch attend
this conference with President Wilson. To the bankers dismay, the world
was not yet ready to dissolve national boundaries and accept World
Government, so that part of their plan had failed.
The plan for World Government was called the, "League Of Nations," and
although many nations accepted this proposal, the United States Congress
would not support it, and thus without the support of money from the
United States Treasury, the bankers had failed and the League Of Nations
died.
1920
Warren G. Harding (right) is elected
President of the United States, and succeeds Woodrow Wilson in 1921.
This will be the start of a period which became known as the, "roaring
twenties." Despite the fact that World War I had saddled America with a
debt that was ten times larger than its civil war debt, the United
States economy grew in abundance. Also, gold had poured into America
during the war and continued during the 1920's.
The reason for this growth is that President Harding reduced taxes
domestically, and increased tariffs on imports to record levels.
1921
The Inventor of the electric light, Thomas Edison (below), said in an
article published in the New York Times, on December 6,
"If our nation can issue a dollar bond,
it can issue a dollar bill. The element that makes the bond good,
makes the bill good, also...It is absurd to say that our country can
issue 30 million dollars in bonds and not 30 million dollars in
currency. Both are promises to pay, but one promise fattens the
usurers and the other helps the people."
1922
President Theodore Roosevelt (right) who died in 1919 was quoted in
the March 27th edition of the New York Times with the following
statement,
"These International bankers and
Rockefeller-Standard Oil interests control the majority of
newspapers and the columns of these newspapers to club into
submission or drive out of public office officials who refuse to do
the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliques which compose the
invisible government."
The reason the New York Times ran
this article, was due to the Mayor of New York, John Hylan
(below), who
had been reported in the same paper the previous day, March 26th, with
the following statement,
"The warning of Theodore Roosevelt has
much timeliness today, for the real menace of our republic is this
invisible government which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy
length over city, state, and nation... It seizes in its long and
powerful tentacles our executive officers, our legislative bodies,
our schools, our courts, our newspapers, and every agency created
for the public protection...
To depart from mere generalizations, let me say that at the head of
this octopus are the Rockefeller-Standard Oil interest and a small
group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as
international bankers. This little coterie of powerful international
bankers virtually run the United States Government for their own
selfish purposes.
They practically control both parties, write political platforms,
make cats paws of party leaders, use the leading men of private
organizations, and resort to every device to place in nomination for
high public office only such candidates as will be amenable to the
dictates of corrupt big business ...these International Bankers and
Rockefeller-Standard Oil interests
control the majority of newspapers and
magazines in this country."
1923
On August 2nd, President Warren Harding
died on a train in mysterious circumstances. The cause was given as
either food poisoning or a stroke although no autopsy was performed. He
was succeeded by his Vice-President Calvin Coolidge (right). President
Coolidge continued Harding's tax cutting and tariff raising policies.
This policy was so successful that the economy still continued to grow,
and the huge Federal Debt built up during World War I, under Harding and
Coolidge was reduced by 38% down to 16 billion dollars. This was when
the Federal Reserve started flooding the country with money, increasing
the money supply by 62%.
Representative Charles A Lindbergh Sr. stated,
"The financial system... has been turned
over to... the Federal Reserve Board. That board administers the
finance system by authority of ...a purely profiteering group. The
system is private, conducted for the sole purpose of
obtaining the greatest possible profits, from the use of other
people's money."
1924
Shortly before his death this year, President Woodrow Wilson made
the following statement in relation to his support for the Federal
Reserve,
"I have unwittingly ruined my country."
1927
In July, in Europe, Bank of England Governor
Montagu Norman (right), Benjamin Strong (below) of the Federal Reserve
Bank, and Dr. Hjalmar Schacht (far below-right) of the Reichsbank, met in
conference.
No public reports were ever made of these conferences, which
happened on numerous occasions and were wholly informal, but which
covered many important questions of gold movements, the stability of
world trade, and world economy.
Montagu Norman was obsessed with getting back the gold that England had
lost to America during World War I and returning the Bank of England to
its former position of dominance in world finance.
Republican Congressman, Louis T. McFadden,
Chairman of the House Banking & Currency Committee, from 1920 to 1931,
would comment on this Bank of England plan in the midst of the Great
Depression in February 1931 when he stated,
"I think it can hardly be disputed that
the statesmen and financiers of Europe are ready to take almost any
means to reacquire rapidly the gold stock which Europe lost to
America as a result of World War I."
1929
In April, Paul Warburg sent out a
secret warning to his friends that a collapse and nationwide depression
had been planned for later that year. It is certainly no coincidence
that the biographies of all the Wall Street giants of that era:
...all marveled at the fact these people got
out of the stock market completely just before the crash and put their
assets into cash or gold.
So, as all the bankers and their friends already knew, in August the
Federal Reserve began to tighten the money supply. Then on 24th October
the big New York bankers called in their 24 hour broker call loans. This
meant that both the stockbrokers and their customers had to dump their
stocks on the stock market to cover their loans, irrespective of what
price they had to sell them for.
As a result of this the stock market crashed on a day that would go down
in history as, "Black Thursday."
In his book,
The Great Crash 1929, John Kenneth
Gailbraith makes the following shocking statement,
"At the height of the selling frenzy
Bernard Baruch brought Winston Churchill into the visitors gallery
of the New York Stock Exchange to witness the panic and impress him
with his power over the wild events on the floor."
Republican Congressman, Louis T McFadden,
Chairman of the House Banking & Currency Committee, from 1920 to 1931,
was as usual quite candid as to who was responsible. He stated of this
crash,
"It was not accidental. It was a
carefully contrived occurrence... The international bankers sought
to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge
as rulers of us all."
Curtis B. Dall, the son-in-law of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was working for Lehmann Brothers as a
broker, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, on the day of the
crash, stated in his 1967 book,
F. D. R. My Exploited Father-In-Law,
"Actually, it was the calculated
'shearing' of the public by the World-Money powers triggered by the
planned sudden shortage of call money in the New York Money Market."
Despite the claims of how the Federal
Reserve would protect the country against depressions and inflation,
they continued to further contract the money supply. Between 1929 and
1933, they reduced the money supply by an additional 33%.
Even, Milton Friedman (right), the Nobel Peace Prize
winning economist stated the following in a radio interview in January
1996,
"The Federal Reserve definitely caused
the Great Depression by contracting the amount of currency in
circulation by one-third from 1929 to 1933."
In only a few weeks from the day of the
crash, 3 billion dollars of wealth vanished.
Within a year, 40 billion
dollars of wealth vanished. However, it
did not simply disappear, it
just ended up consolidated in fewer and fewer hands, as was planned. An example of this is
Joseph P. Kennedy (right), John F. Kennedy's
father. In 1929 he was worth 4 million dollars, in 1935 that had
increased to over 100 million dollars.
This is why depressions are caused. As stated previously the top bankers
and their friends got out of the stock market and purchased gold just
before the crash, which they shipped over to London. This meant that the
money lost by most Americans during the crash didn't just vanish, it
just ended up in these people's hands.
It also was spent overseas, as whilst the Great Depression was
occurring, millions of American dollars was being spent on rebuilding
Germany from damage sustained during World War I, in preparation for the
bankers World War II.
Republican Louis T. McFadden,
Chairman of the House Banking & Currency Committee from 1920 to
1931, stated the following in relation to this,
"After World War I, Germany fell into
the hands of the German International Bankers. Those bankers bought
her and now they own her, lock, stock, and barrel. They have
purchased her industries, they have mortgages on her soil, they
control her production, they control all her public utilities.
The international German bankers have subsidized the present
Government of Germany and they have also supplied every dollar of
the money Adolph Hitler has used in his lavish campaign to build up
a threat to the government of Bruening. When Bruening fails to obey
the orders of the German International Bankers, Hitler is brought
forth to scare the Germans into submission...
Through the Federal Reserve Board over 30 billion of dollars of
American money... has been pumped into Germany... You have all heard
of the spending that has taken place in Germany ...modernistic
dwellings, her great planetariums, her gymnasiums, her swimming
pools, her fine public highways, her perfect factories.
All this was done on our money. All this was given to Germany
through the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board... has
pumped so many billions of dollars into Germany that they dare not
name the total."
The
money pumped in to Germany to build her
up in preparation for World War II, was into the German Thyssen banks
which were affiliated with the Harriman interest in New York.
1930
The Bank for International Settlements
(BIS)
was established by Charles G. Dawes (left) (Rothschild agent and Vice
President under President Calvin Coolidge from 1925-1929), Owen D.
Young (below-right) (Rothschild agent, founder of RCA and Chairman of General
Electric from 1922 until 1939), and Hjalmar Schacht of Germany
(President of the Reichsbank).
Bank for International Settlements
The BIS is referred to the bankers as the, "Central bank for the central
banks."
Whereas the
IMF and the
World Bank deal with governments, the
BIS deals only with other central banks. All its meetings are held in
secret and involve the top central bankers from around the world.
For
example the former head of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan,
would go to the BIS headquarters in Basel, Switzerland, ten times a year
for these private meetings.
The BIS also has the status of a sovereign power and is immune from
governmental control.
A summary of this immunity is listed below:
-
Diplomatic immunity for persons and what
they carry with them (i.e., diplomatic pouches).
-
No taxation on any transactions,
including salaries paid to employees.
-
Embassy-type immunity for all buildings
and/or offices operated by the BIS worldwide including China and
Mexico.
-
No oversight or knowledge of operations
by any government authority, they are not audited.
-
Freedom from immigration restrictions.
-
Freedom to encrypt any and all
communications of any sort.
-
Freedom from any legal jurisdiction,
they even have their own police force.
BIS' current board of directors, only five
of which are elected and the rest of which are permanent, are:
-
Nout H E M Wellink, Amsterdam (Chairman
of the Board of Directors)
-
Hans Tietmeyer, Frankfurt am Main
(Vice-Chairman)
-
Axel Weber, Frankfurt am Main
-
Vincenzo Desario, Rome
-
Antonio Fazio, Rome
-
David Dodge, Ottawa
-
Toshihiko Fukui, Tokyo
-
Timothy F Geithner, New York
-
Alan Greenspan, Washington
-
Lord George, London
-
Hervé Hannoun, Paris

Alfons Vicomte Verplaetse, Brussels
Georgetown Professor and historian,
Carroll Quigley (right), commented on the creation of this central bank in
his 1975 book,
Tragedy And Hope,
as follows,
"The powers of financial capitalism had
(a) far reaching (plan), nothing less than to create a world system
of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political
system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This
system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central
banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived
at in frequent meetings and conferences.
The apex of the system was to be the Bank For International
Settlements in Basel, Switzerland
*,
a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks
which were themselves private corporations.
Each central bank ...sought to dominate its government by its
ability to control treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges,
to influence the level of economic activity in the Country, and to
influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in
the business world."
* Home of
first World Zionist Congress, chaired by Theodor Herzl in 1897
A handful of United States Senators led by Henry Cabot Lodge
(below), fought to keep the United States out of the Bank for International
Settlements.
However, even thought the United States
rejected this World Central Bank, the Federal Reserve still sent members
to participate in its meetings in Switzerland, right up until 1994 when
the United States was, "officially," dragged into it.
1932
Republican Representative Louis T. McFadden of Pennsylvania,
the Former Chairman of the House Banking & Currency Commission during
the
great depression, states,
"We have in this country one of the most
corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the
Federal Reserve Board...This evil institution has impoverished...the
people of the United States...and has practically bankrupted our
government. It has done this through...the corrupt practices of the
moneyed vultures who control it."
In his final year in office, President
Herbert Hoover (right) puts forward a plan to bail out the failing banks, he
seemed to feel that they took priority over millions of starving
Americans, however this plan did not receive support from the Democratic
Congress. Hoover's Presidency failing, Franklin D. Roosevelt is elected
President later this year.
1933
On March 4th, during his inaugural address, President Roosevelt made
the following statement,
"Practices of the unscrupulous money
changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by
the hearts and minds of men... The money changers have fled from
their high seats in the temple of our civilization."
However, later that year, President
Roosevelt outlawed private ownership of all gold bullion and all gold
coins with the exception of rare coins. Most of the gold in the hands of
the average American was in the form of gold coins and this decree by
Roosevelt was
effectively a confiscation.
In small town America, the people did not trust Roosevelt. However, the
people were given a simple choice. Either turn in your gold and be paid
the official price for it of, $20-66 an ounce, or you will be liable for
a $10,000 fine and a ten year prison sentence.
This confiscation order was so unpopular, it's author has never been
discovered. No Congressman ever claimed having written it, President
Roosevelt stated he had not written it, nor had he even read it.
Roosevelt's Secretary of the Treasury, William H. Woodin (right), claimed
he'd never read it either, but that it was, he stated,
"What the experts wanted."
I wonder to what, "experts," he refers!
1934
In its 20th June issue, New Britain magazine of London published a
statement made by former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George
(below)
that,
"Britain is the slave of an
international financial bloc."
Also in the article was the following words
written by Lord Bryce (right),
"Democracy has no more persistent and
insidious foe than money power ...questions regarding Bank of
England, its conduct and its objects, are not allowed by the Speaker
(of the House of Commons)."
Louis T. McFadden, Republican
Congressman and Chairman of the House Banking & Currency Committee
from 1920 to 1931 stated,
"Through the Fed the people are losing
their rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution ...common
decency requires us to examine the public accounts of the government
and see what kind of crimes against the public welfare have been
committed... the people of these United States are being greatly
wronged...
Every effort has been made by the Fed to conceal its powers-but
truth is-the Fed has usurped the Government... the sack of these
United States by the Fed is the greatest crime in history... what
King ever robbed his subject to such an extent as the Fed has robbed
us... it is a monstrous thing for this great nation of people to
have its destinies presided over by a traitorous government board
acting in secret concert with international usurer.
When the Fed was passed, the people of these United States did not
perceive that a world system was being set up here ...a super state
controlled by international bankers, and international
industrialists acting together to enslave the world for their own
pleasure."
1935
All the gold held by American citizens had
finally been turned in under President Roosevelt's 1933 confiscation
order at the price of $20-66 an ounce. Without explanation the official
price of gold was then raised to $35 per ounce. The only catch was that
only foreigners could sell their gold at the new higher price. Where is
the world price of gold set? Since 1919, in the same room of private
bank N. M. Rothschild & Sons in London, at 11:00 a.m., on a daily basis.
Therefore Warburg and his banking friends who put their money into gold
at $20-66 before the stock market crash and shipped it to London, could
now ship it back and sell it to the United States Government for the new
higher price.
The money changers have a golden rule,
"He who has the gold, makes the rules."
President Roosevelt orders the
building of a new gold bullion depository to hold the vast amount of
gold the United States government had illegally confiscated. That
depository was Fort Knox.
1936
On October 3, Republican Congressman,
Louis T. McFadden, Chairman of the House Banking & Currency
Committee, from 1920 to 1931, is poisoned to death. This was the
third assassination attempt on his life, he had suffered an earlier
poisoning and had had shots fired at him.
He had been trying for years to get the Federal Reserve, and as you will
have read thus far, had made very revealing statements about the Federal
Reserve. He had been warned to back off, but this great American
Patriot, put the people he represented before himself, as all elected
officials are supposed to do, and was killed by the bankers as a result.
1937
With Fort Knox having been completed only
the previous year, the gold now began to flow into it.
Fort Knox
1938
With the Federal Reserve having been in control of the United States
economy for 25 years under the pretext of promoting monetary
stability, it has caused three major economic downturns including
the Great Depression.
As Nobel Prize winning economist Milton
Friedman put it,
"The stock of money, prices and output
was decidedly more unstable after the establishment of the Reserve
System than before. The most dramatic period of instability in
output was, of course, the period between the two wars, which
includes the severe (monetary) contractions of 1920-21, 1929-33, and
1937-38. No other 20 year period in American history contains as
many as three such severe contractions.
This evidence persuades me that at least a third of the price rise
during and just after World War I is attributable to the
establishment of the Federal Reserve System...and that the severity
of each of the major contractions - 1920-21, 1929-33, and 1937-38 -
is directly attributable to acts of commission and omission by the
Reserve authorities...
Any system which gives so much power and so much discretion to a few
men, (so) that mistakes - excusable or not - can have such far
reaching effects is a bad system. It is a bad system to believers in
freedom just because it gives a few men such power without any
effective check by the body politic - this is the key political
argument against an independent central bank...To paraphrase
Clemenceau money is much too serious a matter to be left to the
central bankers."
Milton Friedman would also state,
"I know of no severe depression, in any
country or any time that was not accompanied by a sharp decline in
the stock of money, and equally of no sharp decline in the stock of
money that was not accompanied by a severe depression."
1941
Sir Josiah Stamp, director of the Bank of England during the
years 1928-1941, made the following statement with regard to banking,
"The modern banking system manufactures
money out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astounding
piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banking was
conceived in iniquity and born in sin. Bankers own the Earth. Take
it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and
with the flick of the pen they will create enough money to buy it
back again...
Take this great power away from them and all great fortunes like
mine will disappear, and they ought to disappear, for then this
would be a better and happier world to live in. But if you want to
continue to be slaves of the banks and pay the cost of your own
slavery, then let bankers continue to create money and control
credit."
1944
The United States income is running at 183
billion dollars, yet 103 billion dollars is being spent on World War II.
This was thirty times the spending rate during World War I. Actually, it
was the American taxpayer that picked up 55% of the total allied cost of
the war.
In Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), and the World Bank (initially called the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development or IBRD - the name, "World Bank," was not
actually adopted until 1975), were approved with full United States
participation.
The principal architects of the Bretton Woods system, and hence the IMF,
were Harry Dexter White (right) and John Maynard Keynes
(far-left).
Interestingly Harry Dexter White who died in 1946, was identified as a
Soviet spy whose code name was, "Jurist," on October 16, 1950, in an FBI
memo. Also, John Maynard Keynes was a British citizen.
What these two bodies essentially did, was repeat on a world scale what
the National Banking Act of 1864, and the Federal Reserve Act of 1913
had established in the United States. They created a banking cartel
comprising the world's privately owned central banks, which gradually
assumed the power to dictate credit policies to the banks of all
nations.
In the same way the Federal Reserve Act authorized the creation of a new
national fiat currency called, Federal Reserve Notes, the IMF has been
given the authority to issue a world fiat money called, "Special Drawing
Rights," or SDR's. Member nations were subsequently pressured into
making their currencies fully exchangeable for SDR's.
The IMF is controlled by its board of governors, which are either the
heads of different central banks, or the heads of the various national
treasury departments who are dominated by their central banks. Also, the
voting power in the IMF gives the United States and the United Kingdom
(the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England), effective control of it.
1945
The second, "League Of Nations," now renamed
the, "United
Nations," was approved.
The bankers, World War II, had been a
success this time as a result of the physical, emotional, and mental
exhaustion the world had felt after yet another World War.
United Nations
This blueprint for
world government would
soon have its own international court system as well.
1946
The Bank of England was nationalized, which
might seem at first sight to be a far reaching measure, but actually
made little difference in practice. Yes, the state did acquire all the
shares in the Bank of England, they now belong to the Treasury and are
held in trust by the Treasury Solicitor.
However, the government had no money to pay for the shares, so instead
of receiving money for their shares, the shareholders were issued with
government stocks. Although the state now received the operating profits
of the bank, this was offset by the fact that the government now had to
pay interest on the new stocks it had issued to pay for the shares.
So, although the Bank of England is now state-owned, the fact is that
the British money supply is once again almost entirely in private hands,
with 97% of it being in the form of interest bearing loans of one sort
or another, created by private commercial banks.
As a result of this, the bank is largely controlled and run by those
from the world of commercial banking and conventional economics. The
members of the Court of Directors, who set policy and oversee its
functions, are drawn almost entirely from the world of banks, insurance,
economists and big business.
Bank of England
Although the Bank of England is called a central bank it is now
essentially a regulatory body that supports and oversees the existing
system. It is sometimes referred to as "the lender of last resort," in
so far as one of its functions as the bankers' bank is to support any
bank or financial institution that gets into difficulties and suffers a
run on its liquid assets.
Interestingly, in these circumstances, it is not obliged to disclose
details of any such measures, the reason being so as to avoid a crisis
in confidence.
1950
Every nation involved in World War II
greatly multiplied their debt. Between 1940 and 1950, United States
Federal Debt went from 43 billion dollars to 257 billion dollars, a 598%
increase. During that same period Japanese debt increased by 1,348%,
French debt increased by 583%, and Canadian debt increased by 417%.
James Paul Warburg appearing before the Senate on 7th February
states,
"We shall have World Government, whether
or not we like it. The only question is whether
World Government will be achieved
by conquest or consent."
This is when the central bankers got to work
on their plan for global government which started with a three step plan
to centralize the economic systems of the entire world.
These steps were:
-
Central Bank domination of national
economies worldwide.
-
Centralized regional economies through
super states such as the European Union, and regional trade unions
such as NAFTA.
-
Centralize the World Economy through a
World Central Bank, a world money, and ending national
independence through the abolition of all tariffs by treaties like
GATT.
1953
President Eisenhower (right) orders an audit
of Fort Knox.
Fort Knox is found to contain over 700 million ounces of
gold, 70% of all the gold in the world. Although Federal Law requires an
annual physical audit of Fort Knox's gold, it is under Eisenhower's
presidency that the last audit is carried out, for reasons that
will soon become clear.
1963
President Kennedy (below) issues dollar bills
carrying a red seal, and called United States Note. A lot of people
believe he was already printing his own debt free money and that is why
he was killed, in much the same way as President Lincoln.
However, these
United States Notes carrying the red seal were merely a reissue of
the Greenbacks introduced by President Lincoln.
What could have been motive though, is that on June 4, President Kennedy
signed Executive Order No. 11110 that returned to the United States
government the power to issue currency, without going through the
Federal Reserve. This order gave the Treasury the power to issue silver
certificates against any silver bullion, silver, or standard silver
dollars in the Treasury.
This meant that for every ounce of silver in
the United States Treasury's vault, the government could introduce new
debt free money into circulation.
1967
Congressman Wright Patman (right), then the Chairman Of The House
Banking And Currency Committee, stated in Congress,
"In the United States today, we have in
effect two governments... We have the duly constituted government...
Then we have an independent, uncontrolled and uncoordinated
government in the
Federal Reserve System, operating
the money powers which are reserved to Congress by the
Constitution."
1969
Congress approves laws authorizing the
Federal Reserve to accept the IMF's, "SDR's," as reserves in the United
States and to issue Federal Reserve Notes in exchange for SDR's.
1971
All the pure gold had been secretly moved
from Fort Knox, sold to international money changers for the $35 per
ounce price, and is believed to now be kept in London. This is also when
President Nixon repeals Roosevelt's Gold Reserve Act of 1934, allowing
Americans to once again buy gold.
As a result of this gold prices began to
soar. In fact, 9 years later, in 1980, gold sold for $880 per ounce, a
staggering 25 times what the gold in Fort Knox was sold to the
international bankers for.
1974
A New York periodical publishes an article
claiming that the Rockefeller family were manipulating the Federal
Reserve for the purpose of selling off Fort Knox gold at bargain
basement prices to anonymous European speculators.
3 days after the publication of this story,
its anonymous source, long time secretary to Nelson Rockefeller
(right),
Louise Auchincloss Boyer, mysteriously fell to her death from the
window of her ten storey apartment block in New York.
1975
Edith Roosevelt (below), the grand-daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt
questioned the actions of the government in a March 1975 edition of the
New Hampshire Sunday News, in which she stated,
"Allegations of missing gold from our
Fort Knox vaults are being widely discussed in European financial
circles. But what is puzzling is that the Administration is not
hastening to demonstrate conclusively that there is no cause for
concern over our gold treasure, if indeed it is in a position to do
so."
The United States government still did not
undertake an audit of the gold in Fort Knox to quell this speculation.
1981
When President Ronald Reagan (right) took
office, his conservative friends suggested to him that he return to a
gold standard, as a means to curbing government spending.
President Reagan was on board with this idea
and so he appointed a group of men called the, "Gold Commission," to
undertake a feasibility study and report their findings back to
Congress.
1982
President Reagan's, "Gold Commission,"
reports back to Congress and makes the following shocking statement
concerning gold,
"The U. S. Treasury owned no gold at
all. All the gold that was left in Fort Knox was now owned by the
Federal Reserve, a group of private bankers, as collateral against
the National Debt."
1983
In order that Ecuador's government be
allowed a loan of 1.5 billion dollars from the IMF, they were forced to
take over the unpaid private debts Ecuador's elite owed to private
banks. Furthermore in order to ensure Ecuador could pay back this loan,
the IMF dictated price hikes in electricity and other utilities.
When that didn't give the IMF enough cash
they ordered Ecuador to sack 120,000 workers. Ecuador were required to
do a variety of things under a timetable imposed by the IMF.
These included:
-
raising the price of cooking gas by 80%
by November 1 2000
-
transferring the ownership of its
biggest water system to foreign operators
-
granting British Petroleum the rights to
build and own an oil pipeline over the Andes
-
eliminating the jobs of more workers and
reducing the wages of those remaining by 50%
1985
In order to illustrate that the great majority of money is not even
printed these days, please see the following speech by the late Lord
Beswick which appeared in HANSARD, 27th November 1985, vol. 468, columns
935-939, under the title, "Money
Supply and the Private Banking System," which states,
"Lord Beswick rose to call attention to
the statement made by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on
23rd July 1985 that the 96.9 per cent increase in money supply over
a five-year period has been created by the private banking system
and without Government authority
.
The noble Lord said,
'My Lords, on 10th June this year I
asked Her Majestys Government by what amount the money supply
had increased in the five-year period to mid-April 1985.
Interestingly, they gave me the answer in percentages and not in
pounds. Having given him prior notice, perhaps the Minister
would be good enough later to give me the answer in money terms.
The Government reply on 10th June was that the increase had been
by 101.9 per cent, and that of that very large amount only 5 per
cent was accounted for by the state minting of more coins and
the printing of more notes. That 96.9 per cent increase
represented not only an enormous sum of money but also a
crucially important factor in our economy.
I wanted to know by whom it had been created, and on 23rd July I
again asked Her Majestys Government to what extent this
increase had Government approval. I was told by the Chancellor
of the Duchy, speaking for the Government, 'The 96.9 per cent
represented new bank deposits created in the normal course of
banking business and no Government authority is necessary for
this.'
Had he said that some counterfeiter of
coins or forger of notes had been at work there would of course have
been an immediate and indignant outcry, yet here we have a
government statement that private institutions have created this
enormous amount of extra purchasing power and we are expected to
accept that it is normal practice and that the government authority
does not come into it.
When I asked whether we ought not to consider more deeply who was
benefiting from this money-creating power, the Minister said that
the implications, though interesting, were maybe too far reaching
for Question Time, and so I raise the matter again in debate and
hope to get more enlightenment.
The issues are important, they are certainly under-discussed,
perhaps not adequately understood, and I hope that I am not being
unduly unfair if I say that those who understand the mechanisms
often do very well out of them. I make no party point; it is all
much bigger and wider than that."
Notice how the Chancellor of the Duchy gave
the game away when he said that no government authority was needed for
this present system of credit creating.
1987
Edmond de Rothschild (right) creates the
World Conservation Bank which is designed to transfer debts from
third world countries to this bank and in return those countries would
give land to this bank.
This is designed so
the Rothschilds can gain control of the
third world which represents 30% of the land surface of the Earth.
1988
The three arms of the World Central Bank,
the
World Bank, the
BIS and the
IMF, now generally referred to as the
World Central Bank, through their BIS arm, require the world's
bankers to raise their capital and reserves to 8% of their liabilities
by 1992. This increased capital requirement put an upper limit on
fractional reserve lending.
To raise the money, the world's bankers had to sell stocks which
depressed their individual stock markets and began depressions in those
countries. For example in Japan, one of the countries with the lowest
capital in reserve, the value of its stock market crashed by 50%, and
its commercial real estate crashed by 60%, within two years.
The idea is for the IMF to create more and more SDR's backed by nothing,
in order for struggling nations to borrow them. These nations will then
gradually come under the control of the IMF as they struggle to pay the
interest, and have to borrow more and more. The IMF will then decide
which nations can borrow more and which will starve.
They can also use this as leverage to take
state owned assets like utilities as payment against the debt until they
eventually own the nation states.
1991
At the
Bilderberg Conference on June 6 to 9,
in Baden-Baden, Germany,
David Rockefeller (right) made the following
statement,
"We are grateful to the Washington Post,
the New York Times, Time Magazine, and other great publications
whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their
promises of discretion for almost 40 years. It would have been
impossible for us to develop our plan for the world, if we had been
subjected to the lights of publicity during those years.
But the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march
towards a world government. The super-national sovereignty of an
intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the
national auto-determination practiced in past centuries."
1992
The third world debtor nations who had
borrowed from the World Bank, pay 198 million dollars more to the
central banks of the developed nations for World Bank funded purposes
than they receive from the World Bank. This only goes to increase their
permanent debt in exchange for temporary relief from poverty which is
caused by the payments on prior loans, the repayments of which already
exceed the amount of the new loans.
This year Africa's external debt had reached 290 billion dollars, which
is two and a half times greater than its level in 1980, which has
resulted in
deterioration of schools, deterioration of housing,
sky-rocketing infant mortality rates, a drastic downturn in the general
health of the people, and mass unemployment.
The Washington Times reports that Russian President, Boris
Yeltsin (right), was upset that most of the incoming foreign aid was being
siphoned off, and he stated,
"Straight back into the coffers of
Western Banks in debt service."
This year American taxpayers pay the Federal
Reserve 286 billion dollars in interest on debt the Federal Reserve
purchased by printing money virtually cost free.
1994
The Regal Act is introduced in the United
States to authorize the replacement of President Lincoln's Greenbacks
with debt based notes. They had lasted for 132 years.
1996
Ever wondered why all the world's production
seems to be moving to China? In a report entitled, "China's Economy
Toward the 21st Century," released this year, it predicts that the per
capita income in China in 2010, will be approximately 735 dollars.
This is less than 30 dollars higher than the
World Bank definition of a low income country.
1997
Less than two months before Tony Blair
(right) came to power in
England, another interesting entry can be found in HANSARD, 5th March
1997, volume 578, No. 68, columns 1869-1871, in which the Earl of
Caithness is recorded as having stated,
"The next government must grasp the
nettle, accept their responsibility for controlling the money supply
and change from our debt-based monetary system. My Lords, will they?
If they do not, our monetary system will break us and the sorry
legacy we are already leaving our children will be a disaster."
On 6 May, only four days after Tony Blair's
election as Prime Minister, his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon
Brown (left),
announces he is going to give full independence from
political control to the Bank of England.
In his 1997 book,
The Grand Chessboard, Zbigniew
Brzezinski reveals that Germany is the largest shareholder in the World
Bank.
When you bear in mind that bankers of the Rothschild bloodline
were said to own Germany, "lock, stock and barrel," at the end of World
War I, it is not difficult to see who controls the World Bank now.
1998
The IMF eliminate food and fuel subsidies
for the poor in Indonesia. At the same time the IMF soaked up tens of
billions of dollars to save Indonesia's financiers or rather the
international banks from whom they had borrowed.
A document leaks out of the World Bank, called, "Master Plan for
Brazil." In it it spells out five requirements to ensure a flexible
public sector workforce.
These are as follows:
-
Reduce Salary/Benefits
-
Reduce Pensions
-
Increase Work Hours
-
Reduce Job Stability
-
Reduce Employment
1999
In Brazil, Rio's privatized electric company
named, "Rio Light," is responsible for repeated blackouts in
neighborhoods. The company blames the weather in the Pacific Ocean for
the blackouts, when Rio is on the Atlantic. The blackouts wouldn't have
anything to do with the fact that after privatization Rio Light axed 40%
of the company's workforce would it?
No problem for Rio Light, as a result of
that their share price went up 33%.
2000
The IMF require Argentina to cut the
government budget deficit from its current $5.3 billion to $4.1 billion
the following year, 2001. At that point unemployment was running at 20%
of the working population. They then upped the ante and demanded an
elimination of the deficit. The IMF had some ideas of how this could be
achieved. Cut the government's emergency employment program from $200 a
month to $160 a month.
They also asked for an across the board 12 - 15% cut in salaries for
civil servants and the cutting of pensions to the elderly by 13%. By
December of 2001, middle class Argentineans sick of literally hunting
the streets for garbage to eat, started burning down Buenos Aires. In
January Argentina devalued the Peso wiping out the value of many common
people's savings accounts.
Dismayed that they can't rape that country
further, James Wolfensohn (right), President of the World Bank,
states,
"Almost all major utilities have been
privatized."
How do they control the unrest within the
population?
Let me see, an Argentinean bus driver, a thirty seven year
old father of five, lost his job as a bus driver from a company that
owed him 9 months pay. During a demonstration against this and other
injustices perpetrated upon him and the population, the military police
shot him dead with a bullet through the head.
In Tanzania with approximately 1.3 million people dying of AIDS, the
World Bank and the IMF decided to require Tanzania to charge for what
were previously free hospital appointments. They also ordered Tanzania
to charge school fees for their previously free education system then
expressed surprise when school enrolment dropped from 80% to 66%.
The IMF and World Bank have been in charge of Tanzania's economy since
1985 during which time Tanzania's GDP dropped from $309 to $210 per
capita, standards of literacy fell and the rate of abject poverty
increased to envelop 51% of the population.
When the IMF and World Bank took charge in
1985, Tanzania was a socialist nation. In June 2000 the World Bank
reported arrogantly,
"One legacy of socialism is that most
people continue to believe the State has a fundamental role in
promoting development and providing social services."
There is rioting in Bolivia
after the World
Bank drastically increase the price of water. The World Bank claim this
is necessary to provide for desperately needed repairs and expansion.
This is poppycock, my own water supplier is Wessex Water, a privatized
water company that was actually owned by Enron! Since privatization
(England was the first country to privatize the public water supply),
the quality dropped and the prices exploded.
Almost all
privatized water companies in Britain
have consistently failed to meet government targets on leakages.
2001
Professor Joseph Stiglitz (right), former
Chief Economist of the World Bank, and former Chairman of President
Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, goes public over the World
Bank's, "Four Step Strategy," which is designed to enslave nations to
the bankers.
I summarize this below,
-
Step One - Privatization
This is actually where national leaders are offered 10%
commissions to their secret Swiss bank accounts in exchange for them
trimming a few billion dollars off the sale price of national
assets. Bribery and corruption, pure and simple.
-
Step Two - Capital Market
Liberalization
This is the repealing any laws that taxes money going over its
borders. Stiglitz calls this the, "hot money," cycle. Initially cash
comes in from abroad to speculate in real estate and currency, then
when the economy in that country starts to look promising, this
outside wealth is pulled straight out again, causing the economy to
collapse.
The nation then requires IMF help and the IMF provides it under the
pretext that they raise interest rates anywhere from 30% to 80%.
This happened in Indonesia and Brazil, also in other Asian and Latin
American nations. These higher interest rates consequently
impoverish a country, demolishing property values, savaging
industrial production and draining national treasuries.
-
Step Three - Market Based Pricing
This is where the prices of food, water and domestic gas are
raised which predictably leads to social unrest in the respective
nation, now more commonly referred to as, "IMF Riots." These riots
cause the flight of capital and government bankruptcies. This
benefits the foreign corporations as the nations remaining assets
can be purchased at rock bottom prices.
-
Step Four - Free Trade
This is where international corporations burst into Asia, Latin
America and Africa, whilst at the same time Europe and America
barricade their own markets against third world agriculture. They
also impose extortionate tariffs which these countries have to pay
for branded pharmaceuticals, causing soaring rates in death and
disease
There are a lot of losers in this system,
but a few winners - bankers. In fact the IMF and World Bank have made
the sale of electricity, water, telephone and gas systems a condition of
loans to every developing nation. This is estimated at 4 trillion
dollars of publicly owned assets.
In September of this year, Professor Joseph Stiglitz is awarded
the Nobel Prize in economics.
2002
On April 12th every major paper in the USA
runs a story that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez (right) had resigned
as he was, "unpopular and dictatorial." In fact he had been kidnapped
under a coup, where he was imprisoned on an army base.
Following
sympathy from the guards, the coup falls apart and President Chavez is
back in his office one day later. Interestingly he has video evidence
that whilst he was imprisoned on that base a United States military
attaché entered the base.
President Chavez, demonized by the controlled western media, gives milk
and housing to the poor, and gives land not used for production by big
plantation owners for more than two years, to those without land. His
big crime however, was in passing a petroleum law that doubled the
royalty taxes from 16% to 30% on new oil discoveries, which affected
Exxon Mobil and other international oil operators.
He also took full control of the state oil company, PDVSA, which before
was nominally owned by the government, but in actual fact was in thrall
to these international oil operators. Not only that but President Chavez
is also the President of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries). The main reason is, however, that President Chavez fully
rejects the World Bank's, "Four Step Strategy," and plan to reduce wages
of the people for the benefit of the bankers.
Indeed President Chavez has increased the minimum wage by 20%, which has
increased the purchasing power of the lower paid workers and
strengthened the economy.
His minister, Miguel Bustamante Madriz,
fully aware of the danger Venezuela poses to the bankers when people
contrast the fact it wouldn't let them in, for example, with Argentina
who did, stated,
"America can't let us stay in power. We
are an exception to the new globalization order. If we succeed, we
are an example to all the Americas."
2006
America and Britain is now at war in both
Afghanistan and Iraq, and looking toward an invasion of Iran. As I
mentioned before the greatest debt generator of them all is war. This
has pushed America to the brink of financial collapse.
This timeline is
intended as a record of the past, but before you look at the
conclusions, you may like to look at one person's prediction for the
near future in this mind-blowing article.
