This Awareness wishes to remind you that
the story of Jesus, the
first written word, was that which was put down some 80 years after
his existence on this plane, that it wishes also to inform you that
the composite known as the entity Jesus was that which was put
together from a variety of information.
This Awareness indicates that essentially, under
Constantine, the
concept of the Catholic or Universal religion (Catholic meaning
Universal), the official Roman religion, as that which was a
composite of various religious writings which were brought together
to form that which is known as the Christian religion. That many of
the writings were assembled from various sources, and brought into,
and comprised those books of the Bible.
(...)
This Awareness suggests, there is a book by
Lloyd Graham titled
"Deceptions and Myths in the Bible", that this book goes into the
origin of the stories that have been related in the Old Testament,
especially in the Old Testament, which were literally taken, in many
cases word for word, or concept for concept from earlier writings.
For example, the story of Noah and his four sons having been taken
from writings which long predated the stories in the Old Testament
and which used terms and names for the sons which were identical to
those reported in the Old Testament.
This Awareness indicates that the
story of Moses as having been
stolen from a Syrian myth that had come down in relation to an
entity names Misis. This Awareness indicates that a great number of
the stories within the Old Testament were simply the result of the
Hebrew priests attempting to create a set of myths and stories by
which they could organize their own religion, their own philosophy,
in order to form a more cohesive society in those days.
This
Awareness indicates that the works of Lloyd Graham go deeply into
finding these earlier stories from Babylon, which was the source of
the story of the Garden of Eden, through Syrian and other cultures
and Indian records and stories of India.
This Awareness indicates that even the New Testament is assembled
from patterns related to stories taken from earlier sources, such as
Zoroastrian, Mithrain, Krishna, Buddhism, and Egyptian, and others,
in which many verses are literally paraphrasing earlier writings,
and many of the stories attributed to the story of Jesus, were
lifted directly out of these other writings.
The story of Jesus at
the well, as one which was taken from earlier writings. This
Awareness indicates that it is of importance that entities realize
the origins of the Bible did not come from the pen of God, but came
from the earlier writings in different cultures and nations at the
time these Hebrew priests put this work together.
This Awareness
indicates that these countries who were plagiarized then became
labeled as heathen, nations whose philosophies were heathenistic,
but this was only after their stories had been stolen.
(...)
This Awareness indicates what occurred in Rome was a political
effort by Constantine to gather the energies of conflicting
religious groups and to bring them together to stop the warring and
fighting between these groups that was tearing Rome apart.
The
action of Constantine was that he informed those religious leaders
of the various warring sects in Rome that if they did not come
together and join in some kind of compromise religion, their
religion would not be recognized or legal in Rome, thus, most of
those came and put their best effort into giving their particular
religious dogma and values and their deity into the compromise that
was formed which became the Holy Roman Catholic religion, "catholic"
meaning "universal."
(...)
This entity Apollonius of Tyana is the central figure of a certain
religious order that was prevalent at that time in Rome and his life
was incorporated into the Holy Roman religion or Catholic version of
the Christian epic which became the official Roman religion in
approximately 300 AD.
This Awareness indicates that this energy of
Apollonius was
incorporated, there was also energies of several other spiritual
leaders of Roman religious sects whose stories were also brought in
and there were those spiritual personalities or deities from other
Roman religious orders whose histories or religious myths came from
other cultures.
Krishna for example, of India, was one of the religious cults and
groups in Rome, and his story was merged with that of Apollonius of
Tyana. The story of Krishna as that entity who came into the earth
born of a virgin and who attempted to save people from error and
sin, but who was hanged for his efforts.
This Awareness indicates that this was incorporated in the story of
Jesus and the Apollonius story was also part of this story, and
there were also entities whose religion was that of sun worshipping,
wherein there was the sun and the 12 houses or signs, and these sun
worshippers had their story of Jesus in which the sun god had 12
disciples and these 12 disciples of course reflected the 12 signs of
those who were the sun worshippers in Rome. This was of course an
astrological religion.
(...)
This Awareness indicates there was of course an entity whose name
was Hesus and this entity came from Nazareth, lived in the area of
Nazareth, and therefore, there was an entity Jesus of Nazareth who
was one of the various entities in the composite, but much of the
information attributed to the composite was information relating to
other entities: Apollonius of Tyana for one, Krishna for another,
and the sun god of the Roman sun worshippers, Helios, as another.
This Awareness indicates it realizes this is extremely confusing to
many people. It does not expect entities to fully understand this,
nor does it care whether entities accept this. This Awareness is
only dedicated to giving truth as it sees it in response to
questions asked.
(...)
This Awareness indicates it appears that the
story of Heysoos of
Nazareth, that this entity had a following and was the one who was
crucified on the cross, that the entity Heysoos of Nazareth in his
sojourns had learned much from studying with Indian teachings.
This
entity had learned, for example, the art of moving into suspended
animation and when the entity was crucified, he gave the appearance
of being dead, by moving into a state of suspended animation.
Once it was assumed that he was dead, he was removed and placed into
a tomb, and later resurrected. This Awareness indicates that this is
the entity who went with Mary Magdalene in the direction of France
and England. This Awareness indicates that the entity from Tyana
went westward toward India and many of his experiences later were
attributed to, were associated with and reflections of the story of
Christ, and therefore, it was presumed that he was the Christ.
This Awareness indicates that in understanding that these entities
were each contributors to the story of Jesus the Christ, one can see
how there could be many different forms of evidence of the Christ
story continuing in different directions.
(...)
This Awareness indicates that it wishes to explain how the suspended
animation is effected and how it works to give the appearance of
death. This is still practiced by some entities in India, wherein
through deep breathing exercises and meditation, entities can fill
the body with oxygen so that the bloodstream is saturated with
oxygen and when it is saturated with oxygen, the heart and the
breathing activity no longer have to do their work.
The heart does not have to pump blood to the brain to give new
oxygen to the brain because all of the blood in the body by this
time is saturated with oxygen, therefore, the heart can slow down
and stop moving. This Awareness indicates that this process is
taught through the meditation called Kriya Yoga. Kriya Yoga has been
taught in the United States through the Self-Realization Fellowship
teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda.
This Awareness indicates that in Kriya Yoga, the breathing action
occurs over a period of time with each breath carrying more oxygen
into the body than is expelled, until the body is highly oxygenated,
so that the blood throughout the body is filled with oxygen, and
when this occurs, the heartbeat has been gradually brought to a
halt.
If there is no heartbeat and is no breathing, no energy is being
expended and no more oxygen needs to be brought in, the entity can
lie in suspended animation for up to approximately as long as 30
days. Some may even go longer, but most in the early stages of this
development of the suspended animation will stay in for minutes or
hours at a time.
Masters of the art can stay for days or weeks or even months without
breathing. This Awareness indicates there is no pulse, there is no
heartbeat, there is no breath going in or out, and the entity
appears dead.
This Awareness indicates occasionally you may hear of someone who
comes back to life suddenly, such as at their funeral, or someone
who looks in the coffin at an entity during his funeral ceremony and
the entity's eyes suddenly focus, or he moves or looks and the
people seeing this, realize he is alive, and occasionally these
entities are brought back to life. There is no known understanding
of how it happened, but the entities were still alive.
The embalming process, which is required in many countries now,
tends to have made this a more infrequent occurrence. Once the blood
is exchanged for embalming fluid, there is no likelihood of the
entity coming back to life. This Awareness indicates however, that
in third world countries, where embalming is not practiced, and in
ancient times, when embalming was not practiced, these entities
might still be alive, with the appearance of death.
Thus it was with the entity
Jesus at his crucifixion, and he came
back to life and this was called the Resurrection. This Awareness
indicates that these entities then moved, after that experience of
the crucifixion, as a family, along with Mary Magdalene who was the
daughter of Joseph of Arimathea, through France and on up to England
as described in the book "Holy Blood, Holy Grail".
This Awareness indicates that at a later time, this became the
motivation for the creation of the Knights Templar, and this Knights
Templar became a protector of the Holy Grail. But the Grail was not
a cup: it was the blood of the family, in a genetic sense, the
carrying on of this holy family in its generation and descendancy.
This Awareness indicates that there are books out about this in a
kind of underground networking or recognizable form of structure
which the Church has long sought to keep subdued and to destroy in
terms of any evidence or any exposition.
The secret organizations, particularly those that came out of the
Knights Templar, which includes the Rosicrucians and the
Freemasonry
organizations, have sprung from these earlier groups of people who
were dedicated to the protection of the Holy Family as it moved
toward England, and later toward America.
This Awareness indicates that it was mostly
the Jesuits who were set
about to destroy these energies of the Holy Family to keep them from
surfacing, because the very action of the information coming out
would be detrimental to the dogmatic myth or structure promoted by
the Church. This Awareness indicates the Jesuits were essentially
behind
the Inquisition, and there is also even today, a threat of
destruction to entities who bring out this information.
This Awareness indicates it does not wish to go into any of this
deeply at this time, but to point entities to the books that are
available for entities to research in this area if they so desire.
(...)
This Awareness indicates that the truth often hurts, yet truth also
makes entities free. It is important that entities accept what they
believe to be truth and to keep their minds open in regard to things
they hear or read, to discover whether there is truth that can be
useful. It is not asking that you believe what this Awareness has
given, it is asking that you keep your mind searching, open, willing
to consider, able to think without having your mind already made up.
This Awareness indicates that it has given before: the true mind is
never really thinking until it turns to question everything it
knows.
