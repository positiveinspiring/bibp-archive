This week, secret negotiations are underway in a remote
resort in Lansdowne, Virginia for the greatest global
corporate coup in history.
Its called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and if you
havent heard about it, then you are in the majority because
there is a virtual media blackout in the United States.
To raise awareness of
the TPP and to delay
the negotiations, I shimmied
up a 20 foot-high metal pole early yesterday morning in the driveway of
the Lansdowne resort and attached myself at the top to a tripod.
Negotiators abandoned their cars and walked up
the driveway past me on the tripod and our banners that read Trading away
Peoples lives and Planets future and
"FlushtheTPP.org"
Police arrived almost immediately and initially
threatened to spray me with pepper spray and to taser me until I came down.
A member of our team tossed me a pair of goggles. I quickly attached my
safety lines and then I let go of the poles.
I was ready for their assault and willing to
accept it knowing that millions will lose their jobs or have poverty wages
and slave working conditions, will suffer or die because they are unable to
afford necessary medications and that the planet will be poisoned even more
by large corporations if the TPP isnt stopped.
I write negotiations above in quotation marks
because this process really amounts to the U.S. using its power to bully
smaller nations such as Vietnam, Brunei, Chile and Peru into agreeing to a
trade treaty that larger nations will then sign as written.

The TPP will redefine the terms of globalization
in a way that completely resets the social contract in favor of corporate
rights rather than human rights.
In fact, this agreement is largely being shaped
by corporations.
Ron Kirk is the US Trade Representative. He works for the
Office of the President. And he has 600 corporate advisers working with him.
These advisers have real-time access to the text of the treaty as it is
being negotiated so they can comment and suggest amendments.
However, members of Congress have very limited
access to the text. Congress members can only see the text if they go into a
private room to read it, and they cannot take a phone or pen and paper with
them. And the media and public have no access to the text.
We only know what has been leaked, and that is
pretty scary.
The negotiators are trying to give the
appearance of being inclusive, but it is a complete sham. On September 9,
they held a Stakeholder Briefing at which non-profit organizations were
allowed to make presentations to the negotiators and ask questions.
Kevin Zeese of ItsOurEconomy.us described how the drafts favored
corporate greed over human needs and criticized how they were negotiated in
an anti-democratic way. He asked if the U.S. Trade Representative would
guarantee a democratic process including open debate in Congress and
amendments rather than fast-tracking the treaty.
The representative said that she could not
guarantee that, pretty much confirming our concerns that this treaty will be
rammed through without committee hearings, amendments or debate. After the
briefing, many who attended marveled at the skill of the negotiators to
avoid answering questions.
My broad concerns are with the secrecy and lack
of democracy. The trade negotiators know that if the public knew what was in
the agreement there would be a mass uprising here as there has been in other
countries.
They are calling this trade agreement a
partnership because the public is aware of the harm of free-trade
agreements.
NAFTA has been responsible for the outsourcing of nearly one million US
jobs and crashed the Mexican economy.
The TPP is being called 'NAFTA on steroids.'
Even in Leesburg, VA, where many of the people
are conservative, every person we met supported our protest when we
explained why we were there.
We were protesting the TPP because what we know
so far is that it will:
TPP is the biggest corporate power grab in
history.
Under the TPP transnational corporations will
have more power than individual nations.
President Obama promised to renegotiate NAFTA in a way that was
favorable to the American people.
However, it appears that the opposite is
happening with the TPP. We are
asking President Obama to live up to his campaign promise of greater
transparency and release the text of the TPP. We are also asking that there
be a democratic review process in Congress before a vote on the TPP.
Time is of the essence because this is the final
round of negotiations in the U.S. TPP negotiations were started under
President Bush but didnt really get going in earnest until three years ago.
The goal of the White House is to complete the TPP soon because larger
nations are interested in signing onto it.
I ask that every person who reads this to
forward it to their family and friends. Pressure your local media to cover
the TPP. Do what you can do to raise visibility. We can stop this global
corporate coup if we expose it. And we must stop it if we want a healthy
future for ourselves, our families and all people across the globe.
Last Sunday I stood with hundreds of people
outside of the Lansdowne Resort.
We chanted,
The TPP stinks! Flush the TPP.
