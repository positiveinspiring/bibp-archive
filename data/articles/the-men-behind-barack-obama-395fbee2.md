In this interview, conducted by Deep Journal
before the 4 November elections, Webster Tarpley expounds on the topic of
his recently published book "Obama, The Postmodern Coup, The Making of a
Manchurian Candidate".
Does Obama represent a real change or is it the
same old imperialism with cosmetic surgery?
Tarpley argues that there is more to Obama than his charismatic appearance.
Exit the "neo-cons", the real power behind the throne is now
Zbigniew
Brzezinski whose policies, he claims, are far more dangerous and insane.
There will be an immediate shift in the hit-list of countries, starting with
Pakistan, widely expanding the theatre of war operations in the pursuit of a
global geostrategic agenda where Russia and China are the ultimate targets.
Tarpley foresees a catastrophic outcome for the
entire world should Brzezinskis plans be allowed to go through. Whether his
views are correct for now is a matter of opinion and remains to be seen, but
for the public debate it is relevant to take note of his facts and
arguments.
It would nevertheless appear that, so far, his
analysis is being borne out by the recent developments in South West Asia.
