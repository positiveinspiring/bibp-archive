In a less than reassuring twist,
the U.S. government will argue that no one
can sue to end one form of intelligence
surveillance
because nobody is safe from surveillance.

Intelligence James Clapper

Suppose Big Brother is watching you. You in
particular, and all your friends - recording your phone conversations,
reading your emails and instant messages - all with the aim of finding
something to use against you and your friends.
As my students would say, sucks to be you. It
sucks badly enough, in fact, that you might be able to go into federal court
and ask a judge to make the government explain why they're doing it, and
maybe force them to get a warrant.
But suppose you find out that Big Brother is
watching some other unnamed people. And those other people sound a lot like
some of the people you sometimes work with. And if Big Brother really is
watching those people, you need to watch what you say, or stop talking to
those people altogether. But you don't know for sure.
It still sucks to be you. But does it suck
enough that you can go to court to try to stop it? That is the issue that
will be argued Monday in front of the Supreme Court.
The case is called
Clapper v. Amnesty International.
The underlying question is an important one in
post-9/11 America:
-
How extensively can the government
eavesdrop on phone calls and emails by foreigners of "interest" to
our intelligence agencies?
-
And how much can such government
surveillance legally impact American citizens seeking to communicate
with people our government may dislike or suspect of unsavory deeds?
That issue, however, won't be squarely presented
Monday.
Instead, the case will turn on what courts call
"standing to sue." This abstruse lawyers' question sometimes turns my con
law students' thoughts to career change. But it is vitally important for
understanding how the courts deal with constitutional claims.
So let's try to break it down in non-soporific
language.
Article III of the Constitution extends "the
judicial power of the United States" to "cases and controversies."
That means, courts have said over the years,
that citizens can't sue just because they think the government has violated
the Constitution; they must show that they personally have a remediable
quarrel with the government - that it particularly sucks to be them, and
that a victory in court will make things better.
The basic questions behind "standing to sue" are
twofold.
-
First, how badly does it suck to be you?
-
And, second, what do you expect the
government to do about it? If the answer to the first question is
"about the same as it sucks to be anybody else," you're out of
court.
Ditto if the answer to the second question is
"nothing in particular."
Here are the facts in Clapper.
During the 1960s and 70s, intelligence agencies
engaged in widespread electronic eavesdropping on Americans when they
decided that what they intercepted related to national security. The Supreme
Court
held in 1972 that this sort of warrantless spying on Americans violates
the Fourth Amendment.
The decision led to the enactment in 1978 of the
Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act.
That law sharply limited government's power to
eavesdrop on "United States persons," meaning individuals or organizations
lawfully present in the country. At the same time, it set up a secret
judicial body - the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) - that
can give the government permission to intercept communications that come
from foreigners, foreign organizations, or foreign governments, if it can
spell out why it needs the information.
Even then, the government must undertake
"minimization" proceedings to keep from gathering unnecessary information on
"United States persons."
A group of lawyers, human rights groups, news
media, and journalists
filed suit in federal court, claiming that the
surveillance laws
impeded their ability to communicate with
overseas contacts.
The government responded, in essence,
that paranoia could not establish standing.
The FISC has virtually never turned a government
application down.
Nonetheless, after 9/11, the Bush Administration
refused to follow the Act's procedures and began a massive secret program of
warrantless surveillance on communications abroad, including some to and
from people in the United States.
Once that program became public knowledge, the
Administration sought Congressional authorization for this kind of spying.
In 2008, Congress passed the
FISA
Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA).
As a result, the government no longer needs to
specify the targets of its spying; it simply must file with the FISC a
declaration that it needs to conduct surveillance, not on a given
individual, but on a certain class of communications. The FISC does not
review this filing; it simply makes sure the government has filled it out
properly, and then issues a surveillance order.
Government may still not "intentionally target"
persons in the U.S. - but it no longer has to designate a specific target at
all, and it does not need to show that it has "probable cause" to spy on
anyone in particular.
It's a license for wholesale spying, as long as the
communications involve one party in another country.
After FAA passed, a group of lawyers, human
rights groups, news media, and journalists (including Pulitzer winner
Chris Hedges) filed suit
in federal court. They are seeking a declaration that the new, looser
procedures violate the Fourth Amendment.
After FAA's passage, they argued, it now really
sucked to be them; if the FAA program was stopped, it would suck a lot less.
That's because they had frequent confidential dealings with sources overseas
- clients seeking to communicate confidentially with their U.S. lawyers,
human rights advocates and witnesses not eager to be known publicly for
opposing oppressive regimes, and journalistic sources displeasing to the
United States.
After FAA, they charged, they had to assume that
their phone calls and emails might be intercepted. As a result, they often
had to travel abroad to meet with their clients or sources, or, if they
could not, forgo communicating at all.
The government responded, in essence, that
paranoia could not establish standing. True, intelligence agencies might be
listening; but then again, they might be listening to other people entirely.
If the plaintiffs got antsy and wanted to spend money to travel abroad
rather than call or email, well, that wasn't an "injury in fact," just a
choice by the plaintiffs themselves.
In a ground-breaking opinion, a panel of the
Second Circuit
held that the plaintiffs did have "standing to sue."
The plaintiffs had suffered an "injury in fact"
- they had to spend money, a quintessential legal injury. The panel ordered
the district court to hold a trial on the constitutional issue. But the
government petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn the panel's order, and
the court has granted review.
It's hard to believe that it has done so in
order to affirm the Second Circuit.
In the 1972 case of
Laird v.
Tatum, the Supreme Court refused to restrain the military from
conducting surveillance on civilian groups in the U.S., because the
plaintiffs claimed only that the program had a "chilling" effect on their
freedom of expression.
"Allegations of a subjective 'chill' are not
an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or
a threat of specific future harm," Chief Justice Burger wrote.
Laird was a 5-4 decision, but it would be
hard to argue that the changing makeup of the court since 1972 has
strengthened its commitment to civil liberties.
In addition, almost everyone agrees that federal
courts don't exist in order to review any action the government takes
just because someone doesn't like it. If there were no "standing" rules -
rules that prevent relatively frivolous suits - government might be
paralyzed, and the courts inundated, with abstract or ideological lawsuits.
So some "standing" rule is needed; it's just
hard to draw the line when deciding whether to apply it.
In this case, the government argues not only
that the plaintiffs are paranoid, but also that winning the lawsuit wouldn't
help soothe their paranoia.
"The government has several alternative
means of conducting foreign-intelligence collection targeting non-United
States persons abroad and, as respondents describe them, respondents'
contacts could be targets for surveillance by other countries," the
government's
brief explains - meaning that the plaintiffs would (or should)
continue to be equally paranoid even if they obtain an order striking
down the FAA.
The government has ways of finding things out,
not to mention friends in other countries who will pass information along.
In other words: You're right. Big Brother is
watching.
Whatever the Court decides, Big Brother will
still be watching. Big Brother may be watching you right now, and you may
never know. Since 9/11, our national life has changed forever.
Surveillance
is "the new normal." Sucks to be all of us.
