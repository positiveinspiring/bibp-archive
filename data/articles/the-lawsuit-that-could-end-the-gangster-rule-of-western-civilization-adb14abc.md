-
Between 1927 and 1938, under
arrangements made between
T.V. Soong (Finance Minister of China) and
Henry Morgenthau, Secretary of the Treasury, The United States
Government purchased some 50 million ounces of silver and leased
vast amounts of gold from the Nationalist Chinese Government, known
as Kuomintang.
During this period China was partly
occupied by Japanese troops and there was the fear of China being
overrun by the Japanese.
-
For all the treasure handed in,
certificates were given to those who surrendered their precious
metals. The surrendered precious metals and gemstones were sent to
the United States under a lease agreement made between T.V. Soong
and Henry Morgenthau.
The Certificates became the underlying
funds of the Kuomintang and were good and accepted securities.
-
In
1934 a new Securities Act was
promulgated in the United States, together with
the Gold Act, which
required all bullion gold and gold coin to be surrendered to the
Federal Reserve, a private corporation chartered to operate as the
Central Bank of the United States and to be the issuer of the
currency known as the United States Dollar.
-
Domestically owned gold was purchased.
Foreign Gold held by the Treasury was also surrendered to the
Federal Reserve, so, was leased to the Federal Reserve.
This began the series 1934 Notes issued
by the Federal Reserve. These have never been redeemed and the
interest cost was met by further issuances of the 1934 series FRNs
(Federal Reserve Notes.)
-
These 1934 FRNs guarantee the lease
payments and to allow the Chinese Government to continue
financially. These came under the control of the Kuomintang, the
Nationalist Government in China from whom the Gold had been
received.
Many were left in China when the
Kuomintang had to flee to Taiwan.
The Gold had been nationalized by the
Kuomintang who moved much of the FRNs (but not all) to Taiwan which
was built on these notes. These Notes were the underlying wealth of
Taiwan and they were good for value as they were backed by gold.
-
During the war in China, most owners of
the depository notes issued by Chinese Banks were killed by the
Japanese, others later being killed by both the Kuomintang and the
Chinese Communists, thus the Gold became property of the Nation,
especially so, the Kuomintang.
In Europe, Jews who had owned wealth
were stripped of that wealth through various means and were then
eliminated. The gold was taken either by stealth or
by force, that is a reality of history.
-
The Kuomintang appointed guardians of
this Gold and the securities issued by the United States; they are
euphemistically known as the Dragon Family.
The Dragon Family is in fact an
organization that operates between old families within China and
Taiwan, and as such is above the political divide of the two
independent Chinese Governments.
Chinese are remarkable in this regard,
that old family ties and functions supersede political arrangements
which, though they might last for generations, are regarded as
inconsequential over the passage of time to most Chinese. Attached to this is the wealth of
several nations.
The United States in support of the Kuomintang and
resistance groups actually printed more of these FRN notes inside
China itself. These operations were run by
the CIA to buy loyalty of
various factions in the fight against the communists, eventually
being driven out into Burma around 1960.
Largely due to the additional printing
of these notes, the additional Notes were given in lieu of interest,
but directed to specific persons and parties.
-
At the end of the World War II, with
Communist and Kuomintang factions at war in China, the International
Community and the Chinese assented to the Gold being placed under
the overt control of Indonesian President Soekarno.
Soekarno then, on August 17, 1945, came
to be known as M1 under United Nations Approval No. MISA 81704
Operation Heavy Freedom."
This was because much of the worlds
gold had been delivered into Indonesia and the Philippines. Canada,
Australia, Great Britain, India and other British Colonies sent
their gold to the so called impregnable Singapore.
The Japanese, as
per the arrangements agreed to by Hirohito in the
1921 Pact Between
Nations made in London, delivered much of this gold to Indonesia
(Then a Dutch Colony) and to Philippines (Then a US Colony) into
secret bunkers that had been mostly constructed by the Japanese
between 1924 and 1945.
This is why the Allied troops in Malaya
had no air cover or sufficient supplies to that would have allowed
them to resist the Japanese. Singapore had to fall so most of the
global wealth could be lost into a secret system that made
the Gold Standard redundant and fiat currencies a reality.
This gold was documented into accounts through the Swiss Commercial
Bank Union Bank of Switzerland, placed under protection of the Swiss
Attorney General, registered through the Swiss National Bank into
the Bank for International Settlements International Collateral
Combined accounts and then from within
the BIS, blocked to form the
Institutional Parent Registration Accounts of the Federal Reserve
System.
Later President Marcos of the Philippines was appointed and held the
position of M1 until 1987 and then the position was transferred to
Dr.
Ray C. Dam, in October of 1987,
under Legal Decadency to Heir RCD1087 Far East Entire with formal
Power of Attorney and Assignment of Indonesian Assets signed by Sarinah Soetiwi (holder of the assets on behalf of the Nation of
Indonesia as assigned by President Soekarno) in 1992, Dams
authority later promulgated January 20, 1995.
Dam proved to be impossible for the
entire system to work with, (either because he refused to allow
those who placed him in authority to steal, or because of his
personal arrogance
Difficult to know which is correct) and
his authority over the Institutional parent registration Accounts
set aside and the system reverted to the three Nations who had
controlled these accounts since World war II, United States, Great
Britain and France, who systematically and illegally subverted the
established system since 1996.
-
From this we can see that there are two
functional operations.
-
One was ownership and Depository control by
the owners of the Gold
-
The other a control system
set in place to administer and control the Collateral
Combined Accounts as an independent Arbiter
Ownership rights are held by the
signatory to the Depository Accounts in Commercial Banks and Control
Rights have been held by M1.
-
So it was, that the entire world supply
of bullion and coinage gold was withdrawn and fiat currencies became
the order of the day.
However, underneath the notes and money
issued by the Federal Reserve was the underlying wealth within a
centralized system that Nations was intended to be used equitably,
but Bankers determined they would use to raid national economies.
-
In 1963, President John F. Kennedy
entered into an Agreement with President Soekarno to provide the
funds to allow the United States Treasury to print its own currency,
thus subverting the right to print the currency held by the
Federal Reserve.
The Agreement would have transferred
some 59,000 tons of gold to underpin this currency. The problem with
this was that the US domestic currency would have then been backed
by gold which would have been a violation of international
agreements meant to stabilize currencies.
11 days after signing this
agreement, President Kennedy was assassinated.
President Johnson the suspended
EO-11110
as issued by Kennedy and transferred the bullion to the Federal
Reserve. The Green Hilton Agreement was not implemented until 1968
when Soekarno fell from office and when Global Trade made it
imperative that the world have a Global Currency.
As the Gold had been transferred to the
US Treasury in 1968, a series of Bonds known as Kennedy Bonds
were issued in order to honor the terms of the Green Hilton
Agreement made between Kennedy and Soekarno, the 1968 terms of the
gold delivery to the United States being different than made in
1934.
When after 30 years, interest had not
been paid as promised, a reissue of the bonds in an increased number
were issued as commemorative notes and were accepted by the owners
of the Gold, the Dragon Family.
-
From copies of Bank documents received
by Neil Keenan, within the
Green Hilton Memorial Agreement, the
funds the amounts of gold and platinum are specified.
These amounts of gold are certificated
and the certificates and ledger copies with full and exact
identification and recognition codes are available. These
certificates are further proven by the bank reports, copies of which
are now held by Neil Keenan.
The truth of these instruments can be
vigorously defended through documentation in our hands and further
through interrogation of the Black Screens where the off ledger
collateral is held, together with an interrogation of the grey and
blue screens where we will find enormous fraud from the illegal use
of these assets.
-
In the few documents we present with
this complaint we can see that the assets have been deposited, the
counter-assets created and presented to the depositors, the
depositors have been cheated for over 70 years through the
intentional and fraudulent failure of the Obligor to honor the
Agreements.
-
In recent weeks we have come into
possession of the books and records of the late President Soekarno,
and all the codes and ledgers of the Global Accounts.
The size of these accounts can be seen
by reviewing the Collective Agreement between the Garuda Memorial
Hilton Indonesia and the Green Memorial Hilton Geneva, established,
structured and made operational between 1961 and final signature in
1972.
Under this Agreement the assets of the
international collateral combined were established and brought
forward, then, within a short period of time misused to change the
operating systems of banks.
-
Reviewing these books, we can now see
that Banks set aside the notion of operating under the Charters they
hold as banks, instead of being Banks they became like very poor
casino operators and traders, selling what they do not own.
The records in our possession, signed
and registered by the receiving and managing commercial bank, show
the underlying funds in numbers and amounts that stagger the
imagination.
The Green Hilton and Garuda Memorial
Agreements demonstrate clearly the value of the global account
system.
-
Gold and Platinum Deposits ran
into millions of tons.
-
1934 series Federal Reserve
System Bonds, Notes issued in 1928 , Kennedy Bonds ran into
Quadrillions of US Dollars, Dragon Bonds are all recorded
and acknowledged within the Green Hilton and Memorial Hilton
Collective Agreements.
Both Assets in the form of
Bullion surrendered to the Global Accounts through the
United States Government and then entrusted to a private
corporation, the Federal Reserve System.
