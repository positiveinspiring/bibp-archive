# Five Reasons Obama is A Proven Stooge of The Elite

1 - Continuing The Iraq & Afghanistan Debacles
You knew that our invasions and occupations
of Iraq and Afghanistan went against every moral compass you claim to
possess.
You knew the Iraq thing was all about lies
and disinformation. You knew we had no legal or moral justification to
bomb the hell out of that country and then invade and occupy it. You
could have told Congress and the American people that funding such a
disgrace would bankrupt us financially and spiritually
as it has.
As president, you could have and should have
used the bully pulpit to alter the conversation and push for a
withdrawal of forces and funds immediately.
Yes, you would have gotten slack from it, yet with folks like
Republicans Ron Paul and Walter Jones, and Democrats like Dennis
Kucinich and many others, the case would have been one of a bipartisan
nature.
The fact is, Barack, that most Americans
would have agreed with you, despite the bought-and-paid for mainstream
media with its phony left-and-right slants. As far as Afghanistan, this
whole get those who did 9/11 (if they were even the real culprits)
action should have been part of a United Nations policing effort
not a
vendetta or revenge act of imperialism.
By now you should realize that it really had
very little, if at all, to do with Bin Laden or Al Qaeda. It was about
extending our power to that region. History should have taught you, the
scholar, that no foreigners have ever successfully colonized or occupied
Afghanistan.
How many of our own former military officers
and CIA analysts do you need to tell you that?
2 - Increasing Funding For This Military Empire
You have turned out to be the same as that
jackass who you followed into the Oval Office.
Instead of drawing down our 800+ bases
worldwide and cutting this outrageous military spending, you give us
halfhearted political stunts. The military spending last year was over
560 billion dollars
and that does not include the black budget that even
you probably know very little about (so much for who runs things
Barack).
Ten years ago, the military spending was
almost half of what it is now! We now spend, and you know this, Mr.
President, 56 cents of every federal tax dollar on it
and you say we
need economic stimulus!?
Now, you are being forced, along with
Congress, to cut spending. The plan you are selling us is a joke Barack,
and you know it! It comes out to less than 8 % a year over 10 years. Ron
Paul says all the cuts should be completed in one year!
How many more foreclosures, lost jobs,
homeless, hungry, medically untreated and underwater Americans need you
see before you 'Get it'?
3 - Bailing Out the Rich and Not the Public
Have you seen the new film Margin Call yet?
Watch it and understand what really went
down, just in case your so called economic advisors have kept the truth
from you. You could have stopped the TARP program, or at least put
pressure on Congress to revamp it.
How?
Well, that money could have gone to having Uncle Sam negotiate the
purchase of all the bad mortgage paper at fire-sale prices. Then, the
homeowners could have been given a choice to make a much lower payment
each month, which would still go towards what they owed on the original
mortgage.
That way, even if it meant a longer time to
finally repay the mortgage, the homeowner would not have to leave or
lose the house. More important, the home would be off the market and all
the rest of our homes would slowly increase in value.
Instead, your advisors told you to continue
the bailout of the rich investment sharks and let the rest of us
struggle because of their recklessness.
Now, in a reelection bid, you say you finally see the light' and
understand that the super rich need to contribute more by way of federal
taxes. Yet, just like your phony party, you go halfway' on all good
ideas. Your way is to make sure those millionaires pay 30%.
You must know that in 1960 when JFK took
office, the top bracket for federal income tax was at 90%.
When Reagan took office, I believe it was
around 77%, we both know that no one actually pays that high a rate,
what with how accountants can nibble away here and there. Why not a
simple Surtax with NO deductions? You cannot do it because your wealthy
handlers wont like that Barack, would they?
I bet even your new poster boy Warren Buffet
would not go for that much leaving his pocket either.
4 - Keeping Health Coverage With the Sharks
On this one you really blew it kiddo.
You made sure that the Public Option of
buying into Medicare was taken off the table. Why? Because it made
sense! Instead, you push through this phony Health Care Reform
(oxymoron) that not only opens the door for the Private Insurance
cartel
it forces us all to go there!
You really think that the clown who runs
United Health Care, and made over $60 million in one year for himself,
isnt going to circumvent any reforms you push on his industry?
Even if they were forced to cover
pre-existing conditions and keep premiums reasonable (another oxymoron),
they would simply raise co-pays and deductibles to the roof! Who knows
what they would do concerning repayment schedules for the doctors and
hospitals.
You blew it Barack! All you had to do is what Newnan, Georgia did in
regard to cable television in the1990s.
The franchised cable provider kept raising
rates and playing games, so the town went into the cable business
nonprofit. Why couldnt Uncle Sam simply offer any American under age 65
who wished to buy into Medicare to do just that? No reform bill, no
nothing, just good old American spirit of competition.
Oh, guess what?
When Newnan, Ga. opened their own cable
business, the private company decided to
lower rates and increase
service.
5 - Defense Authorization Act & Other Acts of
Aggression
How dare you, the guy who spoke of Hope and
Change', continue on the same course as the Bush gang?
You send drone attacks into a sovereign
nation, Pakistan, without approval of their government. These attacks
kill many innocent civilians and destroy our good name.
You allowed your
NSA to authorize the bombing of Libya when it was involved in a
manipulated civil war.
You allow extraordinary rendition to
continue. You allow Gitmo to stay open, and keep those prisoners from
having their day in court. You push and sign this latest Defense
Authorization Act that allows Uncle Sam to detain American citizens
without the right of Habeas Corpus.
Who will determine whether someone is a terrorist or supporter of such
groups? Lets play the game What if: What if your daughter was friends
with an Arab kid?
This kid has a cousin who is on some
terrorist watch list, and the cousin visits her here. Your daughter
befriends the cousin, and sends and receives emails to him. She hangs
out at parties at the cousin's apartment etc. One night, the SWAT teams
come and sweep all of them up in a raid.
What if your daughter is not the daughter of
the president, rather the daughter of a professor
a very ultra-liberal
professor who speaks out quite a bit against Israel and our empire?
Suddenly, the daughter is refused habeas corpus and detained
indefinitely.
How can this still be called the land of the
free?
