His enemies call him a tyrant and a dictator,
but he is neither.
Hugo Chavez is a tireless champion of the poor and a
committed christian socialist. The only difference between Chavez's type of
christianity and Barack Obama's, is that Chavez walks the walk.
For example, on Tuesday, Chavez used his powers under the new "enabling
laws" to enact the "Law for Dignified Refuge" a presidential decree that
mandates "dignified and humane" housing for all Venezuelans. The Venezuelan
parliament approved the controversial (and temporary) enabling laws because
the country faced an unprecedented housing crisis due to the massive floods
in December.
More than 125,000 people lost their homes in the disaster requiring a speedy
response from the government.
Chavez swung into action immediately turning
the presidential palace into a homeless shelter and initiating a campaign to
construct permanent housing for the victims. Now he has pushed through
landmark legislation that will legally require the government to help the
homeless.
Contrast Chavez's response to Obama's during the
BP oil spill, where BP was
allowed to wreak havoc on the environment and destroy people's livelihood
without any consequences. In fact, Obama even provided cover for the oil
giant by appearing in public relations "I feel your pain" photo-ops on a
beach in Louisiana that were intended to divert public rage away from BP.
So, now the fishing and shrimping industries are devastated, sensitive
estuaries and ecosystems have been destroyed, the level of toxins in the
bloodstreams of people living in the region have skyrocketed and - worst of
all - BP has gotten off Scot-free. Thanks, Barack.
Now imagine what would have happened if Chavez had been in charge.
BP's
stateside operations would have been shut down, their assets would have been
seized, and Tony Hayward and his buddies would have been thrown in the
hoosegow.
Got a problem with that?
Last week, while Obama was singing the praises of "deregulation" on the
editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal,
".. the rules have gotten out of
balance, placing unreasonable burdens on business - burdens that have stifled
innovation and have had a chilling effect on growth and jobs",
...and first
lady, Michelle Obama was hawking "healthy foods" for food behemoth Walmart
in the national media, Chavez was busy transforming shelters into
institutions of the state to make sure that people had a place to stay
while they get back on their feet again.
The new law stipulates that these people be provided with food and medical
assistance (Venezuela has universal health care) as well as "scholarships,
pensions and special allotments of resources" depending on their needs.
The new state facilities that are being set up by Chavez will focus
primarily on,
"the most vulnerable population; the children, adolescents,
seniors, people with disabilities, and pregnant women.
Its not a question of the government wanting to do this or not, said
Chavez. It is now a legal obligation.

Right on. And how has Washington reacted to Chavez's emergency programs and
new laws?
Here's an excerpt from a recent article by ex-pat
Eva Golinger
that sums it up pretty well:
"This week, (Venezuelan) opposition leaders will meet with their
counterparts in Washington. They have already said their mission is to seek
more aid to help remove President Chavez from power.
Unfortunately, their
undemocratic actions have already been welcomed in the US Capitol.
Representative Connie Mack (R-FL), now head of the House Sub-Committee on
Foreign Relations for the Western Hemisphere, announced on the first day of
Congress that his one goal this year is to place Venezuela on the list of
"state sponsors of terrorism".
And Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
(R-FL), now head of the House Foreign Relations Committee, has backed that
objective, even going as far as to publicly state she would welcome the
"assassination of Fidel Castro or any other repressive leader" such as Hugo
Chavez."
("Setting the Record Straight on Venezuela and Hugo Chavez", Eva Golinger, Global Research)
Surprised? Don't be.
Any foreign leader who attempts to control his
country's resources, improve human rights, or distribute the nation's wealth
more equally among its people, is the de facto enemy of the United States.
People thought that things might
change
under Obama, but they were wrong.
He's as bad
as Bush.
