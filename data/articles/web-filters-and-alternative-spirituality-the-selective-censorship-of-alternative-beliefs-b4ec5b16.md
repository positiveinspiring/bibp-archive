Commercial web filters
are often rigged to selectively target alternative
spirituality and beliefs.
Sites like this one can
be classified, segregated and blocked under an "alternative
spirituality/belief" category, which is often described
negatively.
The widespread use of
filters to block alternative beliefs on public networks,
while allowing access to
traditional/mainstream
(religious) beliefs,
raises issues of censorship, discrimination and prejudice.
There are various web filters available that can
be customized to block just about anything.
They are sold to households as "parental
controls" and allow carers to block content they don't want children to see.
Organizations use them to prevent staff from visiting sites deemed
inappropriate or a distraction from work. And they are installed on public
internet networks, such as in libraries, cafes, schools, to make the
internet "family friendly".
Sometimes internet service providers
(ISPs) have filters directly over their network which customers can opt-in
to, while in some countries ISP filters are mandatory for Government
censorship.
But in Western countries, filters are usually an
extra product or service an individual household, organization, school or
library chooses to put on their internet connection independently.
Typically filters use automated algorithms to
classify sites into categories based on their content.
But no filter is
foolproof and they inevitably allow access to sites they are meant to block,
while over-blocking some sites by mistake. They may compensate for this by
allowing users to report wrongly-blocked sites and suggest how sites should
be classified and blocked.
When you consider the range of content on the
internet, it's easy to understand the appeal of filters if you have children
or underage users to cater for. Despite their flaws, their broad appeal is
that they provide some control over the content on a family's or
organization's internet connection.
Provided filters are not controlled by the
government and used to suppress dissent, as happens in authoritarian
countries, or forced
onto the public under a false pretext and operated without
transparency, as has happened in UK, then there is nothing wrong with
individuals or organizations choosing to put filters over their own
connections, is there?
In principle, no, but in practice, apart from
over-blocking, filters can have serious issues of bias built into the way
they choose to classify and describe certain content. This is apparent in
their often prejudicial treatment of "alternative spirituality/belief."
I believe that the way filters separate
alternative spirituality and beliefs from mainstream/traditional religions
and beliefs is a form of cyber-segregation. I doubt such segregation would
be tolerated if filters separated and blocked websites based on racial
content or origin.
And when filters are used to selectively block
alternative spirituality in public places like libraries, it can even be
illegal discrimination.
Filters and the Cyber-Segregation
of Spirituality
Most filters are customizable, which means that
just because a content category can be blocked, it doesn't mean you have to.
And because filters cater to a wide audience,
it's not surprising that they can give you the option of blocking just about
anything.
But not every category is treated equally.
Filters can have prejudice built into the way they label and describe a
category.
This is the case when it comes to "alternative beliefs" or
"alternative spirituality/belief", which are common categories used by web
filter providers, while "religion" is usually a separate category for
dominant mainstream beliefs.
Classifying "alternative beliefs" separately
from traditional or conventional religious beliefs gives the impression that
conventional beliefs are "normal" and "socially acceptable" while
alternative spiritual viewpoints and beliefs are not.
But some filters go further and describe the
alternative belief category using loaded language that makes such material
sound sinister or risqu√©, or they lump it into a broader "adult content"
category alongside things like drugs, pornography and gambling.
This seems to encourage guilt by association,
and makes it appear there is something illicit or wrong about having
"alternative beliefs" as opposed to the "respectable" conventional beliefs
of mainstream religions, which, in contrast, are usually described in
neutral matter-of-fact language.
In other words, filters do not treat all beliefs
equally; they often give mainstream dominant beliefs preferential treatment
while portraying alternative beliefs negatively.
What this may mean in practice is that when
parents, a school or a library etc. install and set up a filter, they are
pre-positioned to view "alternative beliefs" in a negative light by the
filter itself.
This may feed into and encourage people's own
prejudices, or, if they simply don't know any better, it might encourage
them to block this classification on precaution (especially when alternative
beliefs are labeled "adult") while giving sanctioned traditional beliefs
preferential treatment.
Common Web Filters That Block
Alternative Beliefs
There are many web filters on the market: two
major ones are Fortiguard and Blue
Coat. Both of these companies are major providers which service not only
households but schools and enterprises.
Fortiguard groups the content it can block into 6
main categories.
One of these is "Adult/Mature Content" which
includes the subcategory "Alternative Belief" alongside pornography,
gambling, weapons and marijuana and other such topics.
Traditional beliefs
are conspicuously absent from "Adult/Mature Content", instead being classed
under the subcategory "Global Religion" in the more benign-sounding "General
Interest - Personal" umbrella category.
The "Alternative Belief" classification is
described as applying to:
"Websites that provide information about or
promote religions not specified in Traditional Religions or other
unconventional, cultic, or folkloric beliefs and practices.
Sites that
promote or offer methods, means of instruction, or other resources to
affect or influence real events through the use of spells, curses, magic
powers, satanic or supernatural beings."
Conventional religions/beliefs get a far more
prosaic description:
"Sites that provide information about or
promote Buddhism, Bahai, Christianity, Christian Science, Hinduism,
Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Shinto, and Sikhism, as well as atheism."
Blue Coat is another major web filter that
blocks "alternative spirituality/belief".
According to the datasheet (pdf) on its website this category comprises:
"Sites that promote and provide information
on alternative spiritual and non-religious beliefs such as atheism,
agnosticism, witchcraft, and Satanism.
Occult practices, voodoo rituals or any
other form of mysticism are represented here. This includes sites that
endorse or offer methods, means of instruction, or other resources to
affect or influence real events through the use of spells, incantations,
curses and magic powers.
The category includes sites that discuss or
deal with paranormal or unexplained events."
Contrast the above with the neutral language
they use to describe conventional religion:
"Sites that promote and provide information
on traditional, organized religious belief, practice and observance and
directly-related subjects such as religious catechism or dogma and
places of religious worship or observance (e.g., churches, synagogues,
temples, etc.).
This category does not include sites about
non-traditional spiritual and non-religious belief systems (Alternative
Spirituality/Belief)."
Another major web filtering company is the New
Zealand-based company Watchdog (formerly
known as Familynet) which operates as Watchdog
International worldwide with the slogan "get the worst out of the
internet".
The Watchdog categories include:
"Alternative journals"
Sites for non-mainstream periodicals,
information on self-awareness, spirituality, healing arts, holistic
living, junk culture, fringe media, art perspectives, etc.
Cults/gothic
Sites promoting cult or
gothic subject
matter, use of mind control, paranoia, fear, and any other type of
psychological control or manipulation."
Rather than servicing households, Watchdog
International provides filtering services to ISPs, businesses, governments,
mobile operators, education institutions and non-government organizations,
who in turn filter the networks they provide.
If you take the description text for their
"Cults/gothic" category and drop it into Google, you will find that a vast
array of organizations are using their filtering criteria, including schools
and ISPs in the USA.
What all the above filters have in common is
their use of loaded language to describe "alternative spirituality".
While
being broad enough to capture just about any belief that doesn't fit into an
establishment religion, notice how these descriptions are loaded with words
that have negative connotations, like "cultic" "satanic" "satanism" "occult"
"voodoo rituals" "mind control" "paranoia" "fear" and so forth.
These categories all seem to conflate
alternative spirituality with dark and sinister things.
When you compare the distorted tone of these
descriptions to the language used to describe conventional religious
beliefs, the difference is striking.
-
Isn't this a form a prejudice?
-
If so, what is the reason?
-
Are filter providers consciously
encouraging bigotry towards alternative spirituality and beliefs, or
are such descriptions just a passive reflection of stereotypical
fears and prejudices that already exist in society, which the filter
providers are seeking to cater to?
What "Alternative Beliefs" are
Blocked?
To their credit, both Fortiguard and Blue Coat
provide a portal where you can enter any URL and check how they classify a
website, which does provide a degree of transparency.
You can check how Fortiguard classifies a
website by entering its URL in the search box on the right side of this
page, while Blue Coat provides a similar function here.
And guess what? Both Fortiguard and Blue Coat
have this site, consciousreporter.com in
their sights.
Fortiguard has this site down under "Alternative
Belief", and Blue Coat has it under "Alternative Spirituality/Belief".
Anyone using a connection where these filters are set to block these
categories will not be able to read this article.
Here are some examples of websites blocked by
one or both of these filters under these categories:

I haven't done an exhaustive search of sites,
but after checking some URLs it doesn't take long to see that a diverse mix
of views are slotted into these "alternative belief" categories.
Pagan and
Wiccan sites fare particularly badly,
new age sites are also in the mix, and it seems you don't have to go to
China to have Falun Gong websites blocked either.
Of course, if people choose to install filters
over their own private connection to block what they personally don't want
to see, then that's their business.
But serious issues arise when these filters are
installed over entire networks by ISPs, schools, libraries or public WiFi
providers, and block out alternative beliefs in public places in a
discriminatory way.
Web Filters as Tools of
Discrimination
Filters on UK public WIFI block almost half of
religious sites.
In the UK we have seen alternative
spirituality and beliefs blocked on mobile internet, and it's been found
that public
WiFi blocks almost half of religious sites.
Indeed, the overzealous
government-backed filtering regime in the UK appears to be out of control,
and was recently found to block almost one
fifth of the top 100,000 sites on the web.
But when it comes to the cyber-segregation of
spirituality using filters, service providers are not the only culprits.
When a public school or library set up a filter
to selectively block alternative beliefs, while permitting access to
traditional beliefs, they can be liable for discrimination.
Although anti-discrimination laws vary from one
place to another, public institutions are generally not supposed to dictate
which beliefs are acceptable or not, or treat certain beliefs more
favourably than others, or interfere with an individual's right to access
material related to their own personal beliefs or spiritual interests.
Such discrimination may also violate human
rights. For example, article 18 of the
International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights gives everyone the right to
"freedom of thought, conscience and religion" in "public or private" and
forbids any "coercion" which would impair this freedom.
In the USA, discriminatory filtering of
alternative beliefs in public libraries has been found to be in direct
breach of the First
Amendment.
Salem Witch Hunt 2.0
A legal precedent has been set on this front in
the US.
The Salem Public Library in Missouri was caught
carrying out a virtual witch-hunt on its internet services by blocking
so-called "occult" beliefs. The library was using the Netsweeper filter
provided through MOREnet.
Netsweeper - according to a whitepaper it
released in 2010 - classified the subcategory "Occult" in the "Adult"
category alongside things like,
"Criminal Skills", "Extreme", "Gambling",
"Hate Speech", "Pornography", "Profanity", "Substance Abuse" and "Weapons",
...which seems to encourage guilt by association.
Netsweeper defined occult
material as:
"
sites involving the study of secret or
hidden knowledge and includes any URLs about cults, supernatural forces
and events, occult lore, vampires, astrology, witchcraft, mysterious
symbols, and other phenomena beyond ordinary understanding.
It also
includes information and instructions on astrology, spells, curses,
magic powers, satanic or supernatural beings."
Notice the loaded language.
The Salem library using this filter ran into
trouble when a resident researching websites about Native American religions
and the Wiccan faith found that these minority faiths were categorized and
blocked as "occult" or "criminal".
After she complained to the library, full access
was still withheld. So she went to the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) who took
the library to court and won.
The Judge ruled in March 2013 that
blocking material solely on viewpoint was unconstitutional.
Discrimination Toward Alternative
Spirituality in Public Schools
Web filters are used to selectively block
alternative beliefs on internet networks in public schools
Discrimination against alternative spiritual
beliefs can also be an issue in public schools. In 2005 students at Pine
View public school in Florida made complaints about how their school
filter blocked non-mainstream religions and so-called "cults" yet
allowed access to major religions.
In Australia, the state of Queensland currently
filters the internet in public schools,
using the Blue Coat filter mentioned previously.
The Queensland government displays the filter
settings they use online, which reveals they set the filter to block
"Alternative Spirituality/Belief" while allowing access to "Religion" for
students.
In the USA, the ACLU has had success stopping
public schools from using filters in a discriminatory way. The Clark County
School District agreed to stop filtering "Alternative Spirituality/Belief"
after the ACLU complained.
The ACLU reported in a press
release:
"Although the First Amendment does not
require the school district to provide students with Internet access,
once a school district does so, it may not selectively censor access to
websites based on particular viewpoints," said Staci Pratt, Legal
Director for the ACLU of Nevada.
The "Alternative Spirituality/Belief"
filter prevented student access to educational and age-appropriate
websites covering a,
"wide range of non-traditional and/or non-religious
spiritual, existential, experimental, and philosophical belief systems."
Notably, even though the School District
blocked "Alternative Spirituality/Belief" related web sites, it
continued to allow access to "Religion," or websites representing
mainstream and traditional religious views, as well as information on
"churches, synagogues, or other houses of worship."
What is Behind This Prejudice and
Discrimination?
According to research carried out last decade,
the selective targeting of alternative beliefs by filters may be deliberate
in some cases.
In 2002, Nancy Willard published the
report 'Filtering
Software - The Religious Connection' which looked at eight filtering
providers in the US and found they all had links to conservative religious
organizations.
Many of the providers were also marketing their products to
public schools.
Willard also looked at the categories used to
target alternative beliefs and found schools were using the filters to block
non-traditional religious sites, which she deemed unacceptable:
"It should be noted that the terms "occult,"
"cult," "new age," "witchcraft," and the like are terms that are
frequently applied to any non-traditional religions.
Virtually all "new age" religious topics are
grounded in spiritual traditions and religious thought of various
groups, including Native American and Asian religions.
Therefore, blocking access to such material
may raise issues related to race, as well as religion. To classify
non-traditional religious sites in the same category as Satanism is
unacceptable.
If students are allowed to access Christian
sites, which most people would argue they should be allowed to access,
it is unacceptable for schools to block access to non-traditional
religious sites."
More than a decade later, it seems little has
changed when it comes to using loaded language and selective categories to
discriminately target alternative beliefs with web filters.
Conclusion
When alternative beliefs are blocked on public
internet networks, such as in public schools and libraries,
Usually a public-funded institution like a
school or library is under a legal obligation to provide its services in a
non-discriminatory way, without favoring particular beliefs over others.
They have a responsibility to operate any filters they use without violating
the law or people's rights.
It is not clear just how widespread the use of
discriminatory filters has become on public internet networks, but it's
clearly not uncommon. If such places violate someone's rights by censoring
alternative spirituality, there are often clear avenues to complain, and
legal precedents that have been set (such as ACLU vs. the Salem Public
Library).
Some jurisdictions may also have specific anti-discrimination
bodies you can go to for help.
When it comes to the companies providing these
filters, I think they would probably argue that their filters are
customizable, and they are not responsible for the settings third parties
use.
But the companies providing these filters also
bear some responsibility in my view. When you consider the negative way in
which many filters segregate alternative spirituality and beliefs, and
describe this category with language better suited to the Inquisition, I
think it is reasonable to conclude that filters play a role in actually
encouraging discrimination.
This is reinforced further when alternative
spirituality is lumped in with "adult" content. I doubt this approach would
get very far if content was segregated in the same manner based on race.
Whether this inbuilt cyber-segregation of
spirituality is part of a deliberate agenda by filter providers, or merely
unconscious prejudice born from social stereotypes is difficult to say.
But whatever the case, current filter setups
both enable discrimination as well as actively encourage it when it comes to
alternative spirituality.
I think filter providers should lift their game
and stop employing double standards in their treatment of alternative
spirituality in comparison to mainstream and traditional religions.
As filters become more and more prevalent on
public networks, perhaps the greatest danger of all is indifference.
Filters
provide silent suppression:
people may not know what they are missing out
on, and those with no interest in alternative spirituality may not even
realize censorship is happening.
But the good news is that filter settings
can easily be changed.
And laws and rights often do exist to deal with
this discrimination - but only if those affected by it speak up.
If enough of us value alternative spirituality
and the principles of freedom and fairness, then the silent suppression of
alternative spirituality via web filters can be prevented.
Actions to be taken:
