'You
Are Still Being Lie To'
We are told that the "War on Drugs" is being waged, on our behalf, by our
governments and their armed bureaucracies and police forces, to save us from
ourselves.
"Potential for abuse and harm" are supposed to be the criteria by
which the use of drugs is suppressed.
The greater a drugs potential for
abuse and harm, the greater and more vigorous the degree of suppression, and
the more draconian the penalties applied against its users.
In line with this scheme drugs are typically ranked into a hierarchy:
Schedules I, II, and III in the US, Classes A, B, and C in the UK, and so on
and so forth all around the world.
Thus, to be arrested for possession of a
Schedule I or Class A drug results in heavier penalties than possession of a
Schedule III or Class C drug.
Generally if a drug is deemed to have some
currently accepted medical use it is likely to be placed in a lower schedule
than if it has none, notwithstanding the fact that it may have potential for
abuse or harm.
In the absence of any recognized therapeutic effects, drugs
that are highly addictive, such as heroin or crack cocaine, or drugs that
are profoundly psychotropic, including hallucinogens such as LSD,
psilocybin, or DMT, are almost universally placed in the highest schedules
and their use attracts the heaviest penalties.
The notable exceptions to this system of ranking according to perceived
"harms" are, of course, alcohol and tobacco, both highly addictive and
harmful drugs - far more so than cannabis or psilocybin, for example - but
yet socially accepted on the grounds of long customary use and thus not
placed in any schedule at all.
The Failed War
When we look at the history of the "War on Drugs" over approximately the
last 40 years, it must be asked whether the criminalization of the use of
any of the prohibited substances has in any way been effective in terms of
the stated goals that this "war" was supposedly mounted to achieve.
Specifically, has there been a marked reduction in the use of illegal drugs
over the past 40 years - as one would expect with billions of dollars of
taxpayers money having been spent over such a long period on their
suppression - and has there been a reduction in the harms that these drugs
supposedly cause to the individual and to society?
When we look at the history of the "War on Drugs" over approximately the
last 40 years, it must be asked whether the criminalization of the use of
any of the prohibited substances has in any way been effective in terms of
the stated goals that this "war" was supposedly mounted to achieve.
It is unnecessary here to set down screeds of statistics, facts, and figures
readily available from published sources to assert that in terms of its own
stated objectives the "War on Drugs" has been an abject failure and a
shameful and scandalous waste of public money.
Indeed, it is well known, and
not disputed, that the very societies that attempt most vigorously to
suppress various drugs, and in which users are subject to the most stringent
penalties, have seen a vast and continuous increase in the per capita
consumption of these drugs.
This is tacitly admitted by the vast armed
bureaucracies set up to persecute drug users in our societies, which every
year demand more and more public money to fund their suppressive activities;
if the suppression were working, one would expect their budgets to go down,
not up.
Meanwhile the social harms caused by the "War on Drugs" itself are manifest
and everywhere evident. In the United States, for example, there have been
more than 20 million arrests for the possession of the Schedule I drug
marijuana since 1965 and 11 million since 1990.
The pace of arrests is
increasing year on year, bringing us to the astonishing situation where,
today, a marijuana smoker is arrested every 38 seconds.1
The result, as Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, recently
observed, is that marijuana arrests outnumber arrests for "all violent
crimes combined," meaning police are spending inordinate amounts of time
chasing nonviolent criminals.2
And it goes without saying that those who are
arrested for
the use of marijuana and other illegal drugs do suffer immense
harm as a result of the punishments inflicted on them - including, but not
limited to, personal trauma, loss of freedom, loss of reputation, loss of
employment prospects, and serious, long-lasting financial damage.
Inventory of Harm
Such matters are only the beginning of the long inventory of harm caused by
the "War on Drugs."
Western industrial societies, and all those cultures around the globe that
increasingly seek to emulate them, teach us to venerate above all else the
alert, problem-solving state of consciousness that is particularly
appropriate to the conduct of science, business, war, and logical inquiry,
and to such activities as driving cars, operating machinery, performing
surgery, doing accounts, drawing up plans, accumulating wealth, etc., etc.,
etc.
But there are many other states of consciousness that the
amazing and
mysterious human brain is capable of embracing, and it appears to be a
natural human urge, as deep-rooted as our urges for food, sex, and nurturing
relationships, to seek out and explore such "altered states of
consciousness."
A surprisingly wide range of methods and techniques (from
breathing exercises, to meditation, to fasting, to hypnosis, to rhythmic
music, to extended periods of vigorous dancing, etc.) is available to help
us to achieve this goal, but there is no doubt that the consumption of those
plants and substances called "drugs" in our societies is amongst the most
effective and efficient means available to mankind to explore these
profoundly altered states of consciousness.
The result is that people naturally seek out drugs and the temporary
alterations in consciousness that they produce.
Not all people in every
society will do this, perhaps not even a majority, but certainly a very
substantial minority - for example the 2 million Britons who are known to
take illegal drugs each month 3 or those 20 million people in the US who have
been arrested for marijuana possession since 1965.
And these of course are
only the tip of the iceberg of the much larger population of American
marijuana users, running into many more tens of millions, who have, by luck
or care, not yet fallen foul of the law and are thus not reflected in the
arrest statistics.
Needless to say, it is of course exactly the same urge to alter
consciousness that also impels even larger numbers of people to use legal
(and often extremely harmful) drugs such as alcohol and tobacco - which,
though they may not alter consciousness as dramatically as, say, LSD, are
nevertheless undoubtedly used and sought out for the limited alterations of
consciousness that they do produce.
For the hundreds of millions of people around the world whose need to
experience altered states is not and cannot be satisfied by drunken oblivion
or the stimulant effects of tobacco, it is therefore completely natural to
turn to "drugs" - and, since the "War on Drugs" means that there is no legal
source of supply of these substances, the inevitable result is that those
who wish to use them must resort to illegal sources of supply.
Herein lies great and enduring harm.
For it is obvious, and we may all see
the effects everywhere, that the criminalization of drug use has empowered
and enriched a vast and truly horrible global criminal underworld by
guaranteeing that it is the only source of supply of these drugs.
We have,
in effect, delivered our youth - the sector within our societies that most
strongly feels the need to experience
altered states of consciousness -
into the hands of the very worst mobsters and sleazeballs on the planet.
To
buy drugs our sons and daughters have no choice but to approach and
associate with violent and greedy criminals. And because the proceeds from
illegal drug sales are so enormous, we are all caught up in the inevitable
consequences of turf wars and murders amongst the gangs and cartels
competing in this blackest of black markets.
It should be completely obvious to our governments, after more than 40 years
of dismal failure to suppress illegal drug use, that their policies in this
area do not work and will never work.
It should be completely obvious, a
simple logical step, to realize that by decriminalizing drug use, and making
the supply of all drugs available to those adults who wish to use them
through legal and properly regulated channels, we could, at a stroke, put
out of business the vast criminal enterprise that presently flourishes on
the supply of illegal drugs.
It ought to be obvious, but somehow it is not.
It appears to be a natural human urge, as deep-rooted as our urges for food,
sex, and nurturing relationships, to seek out and explore such "altered
states of consciousness."
Instead
the powers that be continue to pursue the same harsh and cruel
policies that they have been wedded to from the outset, ever seeking to
strengthen and reinforce them rather than to replace them with something
better.
Indeed the only "change" that the large, armed bureaucracies that
enforce these policies has ever sought since the "War on Drugs" began has,
year on year, been to demand even more money, even more arms, and even more
draconian legislative powers to break into homes, to confiscate property,
and to deprive otherwise law-abiding citizens of liberty and wreck their
lives.
In the process we have seen our once free and upstanding societies -
which used to respect individual choice and freedom of conscience above all
else - slide remorselessly down the slippery slope that leads to the police
state.
And all this is being done in our name, with our money, by our own
governments, to "save us from ourselves"!
Winners and Losers
Who benefits from this colossal stupidity and systematic wickedness? And who
loses?
The beneficiaries are easy to spot.
First, the large and ever-expanding armed bureaucracies, funded with large
and ever-growing sums of public money to suppress the use of drugs, have
benefited enormously.
Everyone who works for them, including the PR people
and spin merchants who concoct the propaganda used to sell their policies to
us, including their subcontractors both public and private, and including
the (often privately run) prisons stuffed to bursting point with their
victims, are the beneficiaries of this catastrophic failure on the part of
our governments to think laterally, generously, and creatively.
Whether you
are a Drug Enforcement Administration agent or a prison guard, you naturally
have a deeply vested interest in maintaining the miserable status quo,
justified by the "War on Drugs," that keeps you in your job, that ensures
your monthly paychecks continue to come in, and that continuously expands
your budgets.
The second main category of beneficiaries is - of course! - the criminal
gangs and cartels that the present misguided official policies have
empowered as the sole source of drugs in our societies.
Over the past
40-plus years they have earned countless billions of dollars from the sale
of illegal drugs which, had they only been legal, would not have earned them
a single penny.
Who are the losers?
First and most directly those millions upon millions of
good, nonviolent people in our societies who have been jailed or otherwise
punished for the possession and use of drugs.
And second (regardless of
whether or not they use illegal drugs themselves), virtually everyone else
in our societies as well. For the quality of life of all of us has been
diminished by
the growth of the police state and by the murderous activities
of the criminal gangs enfranchised, and kept in business, by the blind and
mindless perpetuation of this failed and bankrupt "War on Drugs."
So, in summary, the criminalization of drug use has brought no positive
effects, only negative ones, and it has not stopped or even reduced the use
of dangerous and harmful drugs.
On the contrary, we have been so little
"saved from ourselves" by this phony war that the use of almost all illegal
drugs, far from decreasing, has dramatically increased during the past 40
years.
Learning from Tobacco
A contrary example, but one that is most instructive, concerns the use of
tobacco in our societies.
Tobacco has never been illegal; far from that, its use has been actively
encouraged by clever advertising campaigns mounted by the
multibillion-dollar tobacco industry.
But the use of tobacco does
undoubtedly lead to great harms, both for the health of the individual and
the health of society at large, and facts about these harms have been widely
and successfully disseminated without a single tobacco user ever being
arrested or persecuted.
Its interesting in this connection to compare the success of public
information campaigns about the dangers of tobacco use with the utter
failure of public information campaigns about the dangers of marijuana use.
The reason the anti-marijuana campaigns have failed is that millions of
users know from their own direct, long-term experience that marijuana does
not do them any great harm and (with reference to the most recent anti-
marijuana propaganda) most definitely does not drive them mad. It may well
be true that very small numbers of fragile teenagers whose mental health was
already compromised have had their latent schizophrenia or other similar
conditions worsened by the use of marijuana - but the vast majority of
marijuana users are not at all affected in this way.
Likewise efforts by
government agencies to persuade us that new, stronger strains of marijuana
presently available on the market (e.g., "skunk") are more dangerous to our
health than traditional strains of marijuana because they deliver much more
of the
active ingredient THC to our systems, have not persuaded anyone.
Regular marijuana users presented with a stronger strain simply adjust their
consumption, consuming far less of it than they would of a weaker strain in
order to achieve the same effect, and feel intuitively that smoking less of
any substance has got to be better for their lungs and general health than
smoking more.
The consequence of this disconnect between personal experience and "facts"
purveyed by official public information campaigns is that huge numbers of
people no longer believe anything that our governments have to say to us
about drugs.
There is an increasingly widespread recognition that tainted,
unreliable, and tendentious information is being passed on - information
that cannot be trusted.
And this distrust of official sources of information
is, of course, only worsened by the propagandistic character, witch hunts,
and scare tactics of the "War on Drugs" and by the realization that the
health information purveyed in anti-drug campaigns is not underwritten by
caring and nurturing official policies but instead by draconian criminal
sanctions and punitive authoritarian attitudes.
Where the health hazards of tobacco use are concerned, on the other hand,
since there are no criminal sanctions against tobacco users, no large, armed
bureaucracies to enforce them, and no special interests to serve by the
dissemination of misleading information, the evidence has been accepted and
believed by most rational adults freely making up their own minds, precisely
as one would expect.
The result? While the use of illegal drugs has everywhere skyrocketed over
the past 40 years, regardless of the violent persecution of the users of
these drugs, the use of tobacco, in a climate of free choice and reliable
information, has plummeted to an all-time low.
The consumption of tobacco,
once seen as a socially approved, even desirable, and, indeed, "stylish"
habit, has come to be regarded as a pariah-creating activity that only
idiots would indulge themselves in.
Although there are, of course, still
many tobacco users - because nicotine is intensely addictive - their numbers
continue to fall dramatically year on year as more and more of us make the
free choice to give up the habit for the sake of our health.
We have, in effect, delivered our youth - the sector within our societies
that most strongly feels the need to experience altered states of
consciousness - into the hands of the very worst mobsters and sleazeballs on
the planet.
-
Is it not obvious that the "tobacco model" could be applied with equal
success to all illegal drugs?
-
In other words, is it not obvious, if our
governments really wish us to stop using drugs, that immediate legalization
of adult personal use must follow, that the giant, armed bureaucracies that
persecute drug users must be closed down, and that the whole matter must be
thrown open, in the way that tobacco use has been thrown open, to the
effects of good, reliable information and the sound commonsense of the vast
majority of the population?
If that happens then we can be certain that
drugs that are genuinely harmful to health and wellbeing (in the way that
tobacco certainly is) will fall out of favor with their users in exactly the
way that tobacco has done.
And if it turns out that some of these drugs are
in fact not so harmful, then it should not concern us at all if some adults
make the free choice to continue to use them.
Of course, even against a backdrop of legalization and good information,
some adults will make the free choice to continue to use genuinely harmful
drugs as well, just as some adults today do continue to make the free choice
to continue to use tobacco. But that, too, is as it should be in a truly
free society.
Republican Congressman Barney Frank was spot on the truth of
what a free society really means when he announced a proposal in August 2008
to end federal penalties for Americans carrying fewer than 100 grams (almost
a quarter of a pound) of marijuana.
"The vast amount of human activity ought
to be none of the governments business," Frank said on Capitol Hill. "I
dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your
leisure time."
It goes without saying that Franks proposal is unlikely to succeed in the
hysterical climate of disinformation that presently surrounds this subject,
and we must ask ourselves why this should be so.
-
Why are commonsense
proposals for the legalization of drugs never adopted, or even seriously
considered by our governments?
-
Why, on the contrary, are such proposals
dogmatically opposed with even more propaganda and tainted information
emanating from the big, armed anti-drug bureaucracies?
That legalization of drugs would shrink the budgets of those selfsame
bureaucracies, and ultimately put them out of business, is part of the
answer.
But to find the real engine that perpetuates the "War on Drugs" we
need to look deeper and ask fundamental questions about the relationship
between the individual and the state in modern Western democracies.
Freedom of
Consciousness
What is Western civilization all about? What are its greatest achievements
and highest aspirations?
Its my guess that most peoples replies to these questions would touch -
before all the other splendid achievements of science, literature,
technology, and the economy - on the nurture and growth of freedom.
Individual freedom.
Including, but not limited to,
-
freedom from the unruly
power of monarchs
-
freedom from the unwarranted intrusions of the state and its agents into our
personal lives
-
freedom from the
tyranny of the Church and its Inquisition
-
freedom from hunger and want
-
freedom from slavery and servitude
-
freedom of
conscience, freedom of religion
-
freedom of thought and speech
-
freedom of
assembly
-
freedom to elect our own leaders
-
freedom to be homosexual,
...and
so on and so forth.
The list of freedoms we enjoy today that were not enjoyed by our ancestors
is indeed a long and impressive one. It is therefore exceedingly strange
that Western civilization in the twenty- first century enjoys no real
freedom of consciousness.
There can be no more intimate and elemental part of the individual than his
or her own consciousness. At the deepest level, our consciousness is what we
are - to the extent that if we are not sovereign over our own consciousness
then we cannot in any meaningful sense be sovereign over anything else
either.
So it has to be highly significant that, far from encouraging
freedom of consciousness, our societies in fact violently deny our right to
sovereignty in this intensely personal area, and have effectively outlawed
all states of consciousness other than those on a very narrowly defined and
officially approved list.
The "War on Drugs" has thus unexpectedly succeeded
in engineering a stark reversal of the true direction of Western history by
empowering faceless bureaucratic authorities to send armed agents to break
into our homes, arrest us, throw us into prison, and deprive us of our
income and reputation simply because we wish to explore the sometimes
radical, though always temporary, alterations in our own consciousness that
drugs facilitate.
The reason the anti-marijuana campaigns have failed is that millions of
users know from their own direct, long-term experience that marijuana does
not do them any great harm and (with reference to the most recent
anti-marijuana propaganda) most definitely does not drive them mad.
Other than being against arbitrary rules that the state has imposed on us,
personal drug use by adults is not a "crime" in any true moral or ethical
sense and usually takes place in the privacy of our own homes, where it
cannot possibly do any harm to others.
For some it is a simple lifestyle
choice. For others, particularly where the hallucinogens such as LSD,
psilocybin, and DMT are concerned, it is a means to make contact with
alternate realms and parallel dimensions, and perhaps even with the divine.
For some, drugs are an aid to creativity and focussed mental effort. For
others they are a means to tune out for a while from everyday cares and
worries.
But in all cases it seems probable that the drive to alter
consciousness, from which all drug use stems, has deep genetic roots.
Other adult lifestyle choices with deep genetic roots also used to be
violently persecuted by our societies.
A notable example is homosexuality, once punishable by death or long periods
of imprisonment, which is now entirely legal between consenting adults - and
fully recognized as being none of the states business - in all Western
cultures.
(Although approximately thirteen US states have "anti-sodomy" laws
outlawing homosexuality, these statutes have rarely been enforced in recent
years, and in 2003 the US Supreme Court invalidated those laws.)
The
legalization of homosexuality lifted a huge burden of human misery,
secretiveness, paranoia, and genuine fear from our societies, and at the
same time not a single one of the homophobic lobbys fire-and-brimstone
predictions about the end of Western civilization came true.
Likewise, it was not so long ago that natural seers, mediums, and healers
who felt the calling to become "witches" were burned at the stake for
"crimes" that we now look back on as harmless eccentricities at worst.
At the deepest level, our consciousness is what we are - to the extent that
if we are not sovereign over our own consciousness then we cannot in any
meaningful sense be sovereign over anything else either.
Perhaps it will be the same with drugs?
Perhaps in a century or two, if we
have not destroyed human civilization by then, our descendants will look
back with disgust on the barbaric laws of our time that punished a minority
so harshly (with imprisonment, financial ruin, and worse) for responsibly,
quietly, and in the privacy of their own homes seeking alterations in their
own consciousness through the use of drugs.
Perhaps we will even end up
looking back on the persecution of drug users with the same sense of shame
and horror that we now view the persecution of gays and lesbians, the
burning of "witches," and the imposition of slavery on others.
Meanwhile its no accident that the "War on Drugs" has been accompanied by
an unprecedented expansion of governmental power into the previously
inviolable inner sanctum of individual consciousness.
On the contrary, it
seems to me that the states urge to power has all along been the real
reason for this "war" - not an honest desire on the part of the authorities
to rescue society and the individual from the harms caused by drugs, but the
thin of a wedge intended to legitimize increasing bureaucratic control and
intervention in almost every other area of our lives as well.
This is the way freedom is hijacked - not all at once, out in the open, but
stealthily, little by little, behind closed doors, and with our own
agreement.
How will we be able to resist when so many of us have already
willingly handed over the keys to our own consciousness to the state and
accepted without protest that it is OK to be told what we may and may not
do, what we may and may not explore, even what we may and may not
experience, with this most precious, sapient, unique, and individual part of
ourselves?
If we are willing to accept that then we can be persuaded to accept
anything.
