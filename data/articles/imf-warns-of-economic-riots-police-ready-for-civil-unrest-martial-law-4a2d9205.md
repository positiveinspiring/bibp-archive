Pentagon resources and U.S. troops may be used if needed to quell protests
and bank runs during an economic crisis, the U.S. Army War College's
Strategic Institute reported.
"Widespread civil violence inside the United
States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in
extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security," the War
College study states.
Incidents of economic collapse, terrorism and
disruption of legal order could require deployment of forces within the
U.S., it said.
A "strategic shock" could require the nation
to use "military force against hostile groups inside the United States."
International Monetary Fund
Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn has warned that
advanced nations could face civil unrest during distressful economic times
"[S]ocial unrest may happen in many
countries including advanced economies" if the economic crises are not
properly dealt with, Strauss-Kahn said.
"He added that violent protests could break out in countries worldwide
if the financial system was not restructured to benefit everyone rather
than a small elite," London's Guardian reported.
In a recession where consumer spending is
plummeting, foreclosures are rampant, workers are losing jobs, credit is
tight and markets are strained, some are warning about a worst-case
scenario.
Last month, trends forecaster Gerald Celente told Fox News
that America will morph into the first "undeveloped" nation of the world by
2012.
He said there will be a tax revolution marked by "food riots, squatter
rebellion, tax revolts and job marches."
He also said by 2012, the holidays will be more
about getting food rather than gifts.
According to the Phoenix Business Journal, U.S. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.,
and U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., said Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson considered the prospect of civil unrest while he pushed
for September's Wall Street bailout even suggesting martial law might be
essential.
Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano, Barack Obama's pick for secretary of
Homeland Security, would not provide comment to the Business Journal on the
possibility of civil unrest during economic crisis. But state and local
police indicated that they have trained for such an event.
"The Phoenix Police Department is not
expecting any civil unrest at this time, but we always train to prepare
for any civil unrest issue. We have a Tactical Response Unit that trains
continually and has deployed on many occasions for any potential civil
unrest issue," Phoenix Police spokesman Andy Hill said.
"We have well established plans in place for such civil unrest,"
Scottsdale Police spokesman Mark Clark told the Business Journal.
Maricopa County Sheriff Deputy Chief Dave
Trombi concurred:
"We're prepared."
Nick Dranias, director of constitutional
government at the libertarian Goldwater Institute, told the Phoenix Business
Journal declaration of martial law would allow U.S. armed forces to control
civilian authorities.
While he said the Posse Comitatus Act limits the military's role in
domestic law enforcement, he referenced a 1994 U.S. Defense Department
Directive (DODD 3025) that gives military commanders authority during
domestic emergencies to "save lives, prevent suffering or mitigate great
property damage," according to the report.
"I don't think it's likely," he said. "But
it's not impossible."
Arizona police say they are prepared as War

IMF warns of economic riots

A new report by the U.S. Army War College talks about the possibility
of Pentagon resources and troops being used should the economic crisis lead
to civil unrest, such as protests against businesses and government or runs
on beleaguered banks.
Widespread civil violence inside the United
States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in
extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security, said the
War College report.
The study says economic collapse, terrorism and
loss of legal order are among possible domestic shocks that might require
military action within the U.S.
International Monetary Fund Managing
Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn warned Wednesday of economy-related
riots and unrest in various global markets if the financial crisis is not
addressed and lower-income households are hurt by credit constraints and
rising unemployment.
U.S. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., and U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman,
D-Calif., both said U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson brought up a
worst-case scenario as he pushed for the Wall Street bailout in September.
Paulson, former Goldman Sachs CEO, said that might even require a
declaration of martial law, the two noted.
State and local police in Arizona say they have broad plans to deal with
social unrest, including trouble resulting from economic distress.
The security and police agencies declined to
give specifics, but said they would employ existing and generalized
emergency responses to civil unrest that arises for any reason.
The Phoenix Police Department is not
expecting any civil unrest at this time, but we always train to prepare
for any civil unrest issue. We have a Tactical Response Unit that trains
continually and has deployed on many occasions for any potential civil
unrest issue, said Phoenix Police spokesman Andy Hill.
We have well established plans in place for such civil unrest, said
Scottsdale Police spokesman Mark Clark.
Clark, Hill and other local police officials
said the region did plenty of planning and emergency management training for
the Super Bowl in February in Glendale.
Were prepared, said Maricopa County
Sheriff Deputy Chief Dave Trombi citing his offices past dealings with
immigration marches and major events.
Super Bowl security efforts included personnel
and resources from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S.
militarys Northern Command, which coordinated with Arizona officials. The
Northern Command was created after 9/11 to have troops and Defense
Department resources ready to respond to security problems, terrorism and
natural disasters.
Northern Command spokesman Michael Kucharek and Arizona Army National
Guard Major Paul Aguirre said they are not aware of any new planning
for domestic situations related to the economy.
Nick Dranias, director of constitutional government at the
libertarian Goldwater Institute, said a declaration of marital law would be
an extraordinary event and give military control over civilian authorities
and institutions. Dranias said the Posse Comitatus Act restricts the
U.S. militarys role in domestic law enforcement. But he points to a 1994
U.S. Defense Department Directive (DODD 3025) he says allows military
commanders to take emergency actions in domestic situations to save lives,
prevent suffering or mitigate great property damage.
Dranias said such an emergency declaration could worsen the economic
situation and doubts extreme measures will been taken.
I dont think its likely. But its not
impossible, he said.
The economy is in recession. Consumer spending
is down, foreclosures are up and a host of businesses are laying off workers
and struggling with tight credit and the troubled housing and financial
markets.
The U.S.
Federal Reserve Bank and U.S. Treasury Department have pumped
more than $8.5 trillion into the economy via equity purchases of bank
stocks, liquidity infusions, Wall Street and bank bailouts and taxpayer
rebates. U.S. automakers are seeking more than $14 billion in federal loans
with fears they could fall into bankruptcy without a bailout. The U.S.
housing and subprime lending-induced recession also has hit economies in
Europe, Japan and China.
Gov. Janet Napolitanos office declined comment on emergency planning
and possible civil unrest. Napolitano is president-elect Barack Obamas pick
for secretary of Homeland Security, an agency that oversees airport
security, disaster response, border security, customs and anti-terrorism
efforts.
As governor, Napolitano sent National Guard troops to Palo Verde Nuclear
Generating Station in 2003 in response to terrorism threats.
Glendale Police spokesman Jim Toomey said the West Valley suburb
developed new emergency plans with the approach of Y2K computer changeovers
leading up to the year 2000 and police have updated those plans several
times including after 9/11.
Toomey said strategies to deal with public
unrest usually involve deploying personnel and equipment to deal with
specific incidents while still providing usual services.
