She had probably done this a dozen times before.
Modern digital technology had made clandestine communications with overseas
agents seem routine.
Back in the cold war, contacting a secret agent
in Moscow or Beijing was a dangerous, labour-intensive process that could
take days or even weeks. But by 2004, it was possible to send high-speed,
encrypted messages directly and instantaneously from CIA headquarters to
agents in the field who were equipped with small, covert personal
communications devices.
So the officer at CIA headquarters assigned to
handle communications with the agency's spies in Iran probably didn't think
twice when she began her latest download. With a few simple commands, she
sent a secret data flow to one of the Iranian agents in the CIA's spy
network. Just as she had done so many times before.
But this time, the ease and speed of the technology betrayed her.
The CIA officer had made a disastrous
mistake. She had sent information to one Iranian agent that exposed an
entire spy network; the data could be used to identify virtually every spy
the CIA had inside Iran.
Mistake piled on mistake. As the CIA later learned, the Iranian who received
the download was a double agent. The agent quickly turned the data over to
Iranian security officials, and it enabled them to "roll up" the CIA's
network throughout Iran. CIA sources say that several of the Iranian agents
were arrested and jailed, while the fates of some of the others is still
unknown.
This espionage disaster, of course, was not reported. It left the CIA
virtually blind in Iran, unable to provide any significant intelligence on
one of the most critical issues facing the US - whether Tehran was about to
go nuclear.
In fact, just as President Bush and his aides were making the case in 2004
and 2005 that Iran was moving rapidly to develop nuclear weapons, the
American intelligence community found itself unable to provide the evidence
to back up the administration's public arguments.
On the heels of the CIA's failure to provide
accurate pre-war intelligence on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction,
the agency was once again clueless in the Middle East.
In the spring of 2005, in the wake of the CIA's
Iranian disaster, Porter Goss, its new director, told President Bush
in a White House briefing that the CIA really didn't know how close Iran was
to becoming a nuclear power.
But it's worse than that. Deep in the bowels of the CIA, someone must be
nervously, but very privately, wondering:
"Whatever happened to those nuclear
blueprints we gave to the Iranians?"
The story dates back to the Clinton
administration and February 2000, when one frightened Russian scientist
walked Vienna's winter streets.
The Russian had good reason to be afraid. He was
walking around Vienna with blueprints for a nuclear bomb.
To be precise, he was carrying technical designs for a TBA 480 high-voltage
block, otherwise known as a "firing set", for a Russian-designed nuclear
weapon. He held in his hands the knowledge needed to create a perfect
implosion that could trigger a nuclear chain reaction inside a small
spherical core.
It was one of the greatest engineering secrets
in the world, providing the solution to one of a handful of problems that
separated nuclear powers such as the United States and Russia from rogue
countries such as Iran that were desperate to join the nuclear club but had
so far fallen short.
The Russian, who had defected to the US years earlier, still couldn't
believe the orders he had received from CIA headquarters.
The CIA had given him the nuclear blueprints and
then sent him to Vienna to sell them - or simply give them - to the Iranian
representatives to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
With the Russian doing its bidding, the CIA
appeared to be about to help Iran leapfrog one of the last remaining
engineering hurdles blocking its path to a nuclear weapon.
The dangerous irony was not lost on the Russian
- the IAEA was an international organization created to restrict the spread
of nuclear technology.
The Russian was a nuclear engineer in the pay of the CIA, which had arranged
for him to become an American citizen and funded him to the tune of $5,000 a
month. It seemed like easy money, with few strings attached. Until now...
The CIA was placing him on the front line of a
plan that seemed to be completely at odds with the interests of the US, and
it had taken a lot of persuading by his CIA case officer to convince him to
go through with what appeared to be a rogue operation.
The case officer worked hard to convince him - even though he had doubts
about the plan as well. As he was sweet-talking the Russian into flying to
Vienna, the case officer wondered whether he was involved in an illegal
covert action.
Should he expect to be hauled before a
congressional committee and grilled because he was the officer who helped
give nuclear blueprints to Iran?
The
code name for this operation was Merlin; to
the officer, that seemed like a wry tip-off that nothing about this program
was what it appeared to be. He did his best to hide his concerns from his
Russian agent.
The Russian's assignment from the CIA was to pose as an unemployed and
greedy scientist who was willing to sell his soul - and the secrets of the
atomic bomb - to the highest bidder. By hook or by crook, the CIA told him,
he was to get the nuclear blueprints to the Iranians. They would quickly
recognize their value and rush them back to their superiors in Tehran.
The plan had been laid out for the defector during a CIA-financed trip to
San Francisco, where he had meetings with CIA officers and nuclear experts
mixed in with leisurely wine-tasting trips to Sonoma County.
In a luxurious San Francisco hotel room, a
senior CIA official involved in the operation talked the Russian through the
details of the plan. He brought in experts from one of the national
laboratories to go over the blueprints that he was supposed to give the
Iranians.
The senior CIA officer could see that the Russian was nervous, and so he
tried to downplay the significance of what they were asking him to do.
He said the CIA was mounting the operation
simply to find out where the Iranians were with their nuclear program. This
was just an intelligence-gathering effort, the CIA officer said, not an
illegal attempt to give Iran the bomb.
He suggested that the Iranians already had the
technology he was going to hand over to them. It was all a game. Nothing too
serious.
On paper, Merlin was supposed to stunt the development of Tehran's nuclear
program by sending Iran's weapons experts down the wrong technical path. The
CIA believed that once the Iranians had the blueprints and studied them,
they would believe the designs were usable and so would start to build an
atom bomb based on the flawed designs.
But Tehran would get a big surprise when its
scientists tried to explode their new bomb. Instead of a mushroom cloud, the
Iranian scientists would witness a disappointing fizzle. The Iranian nuclear
program would suffer a humiliating setback, and Tehran's goal of becoming a
nuclear power would have been delayed by several years.
In the meantime, the CIA, by watching Iran's
reaction to the blueprints, would have gained a wealth of information about
the status of Iran's weapons program, which has been shrouded in secrecy.
The Russian studied the blueprints the CIA had given him.
Within minutes of being handed the designs, he
had identified a flaw.
"This isn't right," he told the CIA officers
gathered around the hotel room. "There is something wrong."
His comments prompted stony looks, but no
straight answers from the CIA men.
No one in the meeting seemed surprised by the
Russian's assertion that the blueprints didn't look quite right, but no one
wanted to enlighten him further on the matter, either.
In fact, the CIA case officer who was the Russian's personal handler had
been stunned by his statement.
During a break, he took the senior CIA officer
aside.
"He wasn't supposed to know that," the CIA
case officer told his superior. "He wasn't supposed to find a flaw."
"Don't worry," the senior CIA officer calmly replied. "It doesn't
matter."
The CIA case officer couldn't believe the senior
CIA officer's answer, but he managed to keep his fears from the Russian, and
continued to train him for his mission.
After their trip to San Francisco, the case officer handed the Russian a
sealed envelope with the nuclear blueprints inside. He was told not to open
the envelope under any circumstances. He was to follow the CIA's
instructions to find the Iranians and give them the envelope with the
documents inside. Keep it simple, and get out of Vienna safe and alive, the
Russian was told.
But the defector had his own ideas about how he
might play that game.
The CIA had discovered that a high-ranking Iranian official would be
travelling to Vienna and visiting the Iranian mission to the IAEA, and so
the agency decided to send the Russian to Vienna at the same time. It was
hoped that he could make contact with either the Iranian representative to
the IAEA or the visitor from Tehran.
In Vienna, however, the Russian unsealed the envelope with the nuclear
blueprints and included a personal letter of his own to the Iranians.
No matter what the CIA told him, he was going to
hedge his bets. There was obviously something wrong with the blueprints - so
he decided to mention that fact to the Iranians in his letter. They would
certainly find flaws for themselves, and if he didn't tell them first, they
would never want to deal with him again.
The Russian was thus warning the Iranians as carefully as he could that
there was a flaw somewhere in the nuclear blueprints, and he could help them
find it. At the same time, he was still going through with the CIA's
operation in the only way he thought would work.
The Russian soon found 19 Heinstrasse, a five-storey office and apartment
building with a flat, pale green and beige facade in a quiet, slightly
down-at-heel neighborhood in Vienna's north end. Amid the list of Austrian
tenants, there was one simple line: "PM/Iran."
The Iranians clearly didn't want publicity.
An Austrian postman helped him. As the Russian
stood by, the postman opened the building door and dropped off the mail. The
Russian followed suit; he realized that he could leave his package without
actually having to talk to anyone. He slipped through the front door, and
hurriedly shoved his envelope through the inner-door slot at the Iranian
office.
The Russian fled the mission without being seen. He was deeply relieved that
he had made the hand-off without having to come face to face with a real
live Iranian. He flew back to the US without being detected by either
Austrian security or, more importantly, Iranian intelligence.
Just days after the Russian dropped off his package at the Iranian mission,
the National Security Agency (NSA)
reported that an Iranian official in Vienna abruptly changed his schedule,
making airline reservations to fly home to Iran. The odds were that the
nuclear blueprints were now in Tehran.
The Russian scientist's fears about the operation seemed well founded.
He was the front man for what may have been one
of the most reckless operations in the modern history of the CIA, one that
may have helped put nuclear weapons in the hands of a charter member of what
President
George W Bush has called the "axis of
evil".
Operation Merlin has been one of the most
closely guarded secrets in the Clinton and Bush administrations.
It's not clear who originally came up with the
idea, but the plan was first approved
by
Clinton. After the Russian
scientist's fateful trip to Vienna, however, the Merlin operation was
endorsed by the Bush administration, possibly with an eye toward repeating
it against North Korea or other dangerous states.
Several former CIA officials say that the theory behind Merlin - handing
over tainted weapon designs to confound one of America's adversaries - is a
trick that has been used many times in past operations, stretching back to
the cold war.
But in previous cases, such "Trojan
horse" operations involved conventional weapons; none of the
former officials had ever heard of the CIA attempting to conduct this kind
of high-risk operation with designs for a nuclear bomb.
The former officials also said these kind of
programs must be closely monitored by senior CIA managers in order to
control the flow of information to the adversary. If mishandled, they could
easily help an enemy accelerate its weapons development.
That may be what happened with Merlin.
Iran has spent nearly 20 years trying to develop nuclear weapons, and in the
process has created a strong base of sophisticated scientists knowledgeable
enough to spot flaws in nuclear blueprints. Tehran also obtained nuclear
blueprints from the network of Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan,
and so already had workable blueprints against which to compare the designs
obtained from the CIA.
Nuclear experts say that they would thus be able
to extract valuable information from the blueprints while ignoring the
flaws.
"If [the flaw] is bad enough," warned a
nuclear weapons expert with the IAEA, "they will find it quite quickly.
That would be my fear"
