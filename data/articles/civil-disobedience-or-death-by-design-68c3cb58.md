Friends. How much time do we have left?
By my clock it's five minutes past midnight.
We are into unchartered
territory. Territory where only bravery and vision can hope to cut through
the torpor and stupor which is bringing about the designed obsolescence
(below video) of
the human race and the
transgenic
re-engineering of the common gene pool of our planetary biodiversity.
As I write this, the technocrats in Brussels are lining up to enforce an Act
designed put an end to our seeds. The saving and resowing of 'real' seeds.
Those in high places believe we need to
'move-on' concerning
the control of the food chain. It's time
for total control. Only seeds registered and licensed by the State will be
legal. And only those with money will be able to afford to do this exercise.
The corporations will own the seeds and fulfill
their ambition to have 'full spectrum dominance' of the food chain.
"He who controls food controls the people".
Check mate...
They have decided that its time to cease the perpetuation of a pattern of
life on planet Earth that goes back to the birth of agriculture - and
before. That is what they are doing in Brussels 6 May 2013 and beyond.
From now on, unless we cut free of obeysance to
the centralized, totalitarian regimes whose take-over of our planet is
almost complete, we will have only ourselves to blame. For we are complicit
in allowing ourselves to become slaves of the Corporate State and its cyborg
enforcement army.
That is, if we continue to remain hypnotized by
their antics instead of taking our destinies into our own hands and blocking
or refusing to comply with their death warrants.
This 'refusal' is possible. But it will only
have the desired affect when, and if, it is contemporaneous with the
birthing of the Divine warrior who sleeps in us all. The warrior who
sleeps-on, like the besotted Rip Van Winkle in the Catskill mountains.
We have arrived at the optimum point to draw a line in the sand. I say
optimum, because the need for food faces everyone of us every day - so it's
not possible to run and hide when it comes to eating.
Its a bottom line necessity. It's a bottom line
that is now one step from being removed from our control. I say 'one step'
because we can turn around , draw our swords and say "No".
Artists and spiritually inspired human beings are not exempt. In fact they
will have a critical role to play in the great fight-back which is our one
and only genuine resource at times of extreme crisis. And, in case some
think otherwise, I want to state that this is such a time.
No artist or spiritually inclined individual can
claim to be such unless he or she is willing to enlist in the cause of
protecting the sacred nature of life itself.
What the technocrats and their Illuminati masters cannot do is defy the
power of the spirit - once its lit-up. And we must get it lit up - or die of
starvation.
Starvation of the spirit is just as prevalent as
starvation from lack of food, on this tragic planet; perhaps more so. It's
an artists job to light-up the starving spirit by feeding it something that
will bring it to life and steer it towards victory, not something that will
encourage it to remain sleep.
I am a farmer, actor, activist and writer. I see no contradiction here.
They are each mutually reinforcing elements of
one life force. Of the gift of life which brought us here. And this gift of
life starts as a seed.
When lit-up - it presents the one power that can
ultimately defeat,
They will all fall to our Excalibur once we
remember how to use it.
Remember we must. To put an end to that darkly scheming little cabal which
is, at this very moment, dipping the ancient sacred seed into the patented
petri-dish of a genetically engineered holocaust. Attempting to forever
remove it from its origins in the subtle soil of a thousand lands. Fight
this with a thousand shining swords, for it is we who are being engineered.
Those subverter's of the sacred are convinced they will succeed in locking
this seed away from the light - for ever, and enlisting all humanity into
their sinister power games.
But, brave souls, nothing can stir us like a
challenge to kill us off. Nothing can set the red corpuscles racing faster
than the thought of an insentient trans-humanist cyborg future for us and
our children. For the human race...
So let us use this occasion - the funeral
preparations for the passing of the seed - to surprise and shock our
opponents.
Let us use this attempt at absolute enslavement
to pledge to take back control of our destinies and that of this Universe.
And by so doing, realize that our oh so long sleeping potentiality can wait
no longer to see the light, and must go forth to fight in its defence.
We can push back the encircling Brussels' vultures and all their prying ilk,
once we are sufficiently stirred. Just as we warriors of the heart can also
defeat the tyrants and madmen of Washington, Rome, Moscow, Berlin and
London. Everywhere...
Let 'saving the seeds' serve as a symbol of defying all life threatening
acts.
We cannot just leave it to the farmers and
growers to push back such a momentous and callous global theft.
Just as we can't leave it only to,
-
'artists' to reveal the creative nature
that exists in all human beings
-
'doctors' to tell us when we are sick
and how to get cured
-
'bankers' to tell us where to put our
money
Saving the seeds is up to all of us.
-
Make a point of demanding an end to the
tyranny
-
Refuse to comply with any demands that
lead to the death of nature
-
Shun the hyper stores
-
Grow your own foods
-
Join hands with your local growers
-
Link-up with local friendly farmers
-
Inspire them to grow ecologically sound
'real' food for you
-
Pay them a fair price and offer to help
them harvest it
Only connect. Connect. Never allow yourself to
be just another number at the stupor-market check-out desk.
Life begins when we turn and face our enemy and
say NO.
