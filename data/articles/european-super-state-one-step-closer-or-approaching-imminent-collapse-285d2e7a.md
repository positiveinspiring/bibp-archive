Jean Monet, the founding father of the European Union, had a very particular
vision of Europe's future back in 1952, and he expressed it in a letter to a
colleague on 30th April that year:
Europe's nations should be guided
towards the superstate without their people understanding what is happening.
This can be accomplished by successive steps, each disguised as having an
economic purpose, but which will eventually and irreversibly lead to
federation.
Here, in a nutshell, we plainly see the trickery that stands behind the
fabricated 'Union' of individual nations, each of which was led to believe
that its economic and social stability would prosper once it committed to
the 'common market' and the various treaties which mark its inexorable
passage to 'superstate'.
The actual mission of the founders of the EU has always been something of a
chimera; Monet's letter makes it clear however, that the motivation was both
idealistic and elitist.
The supranational entity was to be created without
(their) people understanding what was happening following a pattern of
elitist oligarchical ambition stretching back through past dynasties.
We can trace the roots of this latest 'superstate' experiment to the
Schuman
Plan of 1951, which was signed up to by six countries and took the form of a
treaty (The Treaty of Paris) centered around coal and steel industries being
placed under common management, ostensibly to prevent any recurrence of the
death and destruction of the second World War.
-
Germany
-
France
-
Italy
-
the
Netherlands
-
Belgium
-
Luxembourg,
...were the signatories to this treaty
whose empirical purpose was stated to be ensuring that none of these
countries could ever again manufacture weapons of war to be used against the
other.
Then in 1957, the same six countries expanded cooperation to other economic
sectors and signed The Treaty of Rome. Thus creating the 'European Economic
Community' also known as The Common Market. The UK joined up to this in 1973
under Mrs Thatcher.
The formal creation of the European Union, under the guidance of Jaques
Delors, didn't occur until February
1992 under the Maastricht Treaty. It
formalized the introduction of the European Parliament and European
Commission, the latter gaining considerable 'management power' under Jaques
Santer, its first president.
Interestingly, the Commission was originally to
be named The High Authority, which has strongly Masonic overtones.
But
this name was dropped in the 1960's.
The single currency (Euro) element of the expanding Union was launched in
1999, along with the European Central Bank. Lastly came
the Lisbon Treaty of
December 2009 which created the new post of President of the European
Council.
Within this brief synopsis of the EU's birth and expansion, we can detect
the process of creeping homogenization which reflects Jean Monet's covert
master plan. As intended, on the surface it certainly appears that economic
considerations were to the fore, not withstanding the supposedly benign
'common' interests like modernized infrastructure, the Common Agricultural
Policy and the 'no border' agreements which were deemed to give the EU a
more flowing socio economic (and cultural) connectivity.
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was supposed to ensure that no one
would go hungry in the new Europe and that farming interests would be
financially protected against undue volatility within the wider market.
Needless to say, the subsidized mono-crops and intensive livestock holdings
of the CAP have proved an unmitigated disaster for traditional bio-diverse
mixed family farms, food quality and the ecology of European farmland.
Distorted (subsidized) trading policies have also exacted their toll on
others.
What is undeniable in all this, is that Monet's grand experiment has
concentrated a very large amount of power into very few hands; and those
hands are a long way removed from the hands of the labourers and workers who
continue to form the majority of European Union citizens.
The creation of the single currency (Eurozone) has served to expose the
fault lines that have, on more that one occasion, come to the surface of EU
affairs.
Whatever the founding fathers may have thought, the idea that
countries as socially, culturally and economically contrasting as Greece and
Germany, could find commonality via some form of 'fiscal agreement' was
anything but wise.
The creation of the European Central Bank epitomizes the 'trading block'
mentality of the Eurozone.
It has, as Winston Churchill once noted, brought
home the fact that the EU could operate like A United States of Europe.
A
United States of Europe is just what Europe is becoming, with the president
of the European Commission acting as the front man; a powerful central bank
acting as Europe's vault and a weak parliament struggling to introduce some
semblance of democracy.
Within this top heavy and highly bureaucratic regime, global banking cartels
have fully exploited the underlying sense of political insecurity.
The
European Central Bank has teamed up with the
International Monetary Fund to
act as central controllers of the destinies of struggling Eurozone
countries. The result is a cold and soulless brand of exploitation which
appears blind to anything other than the imposition of Orwellian
authoritative control structures that suck dry the assets of any country
foolish enough to seek its financial support.
After presiding over the collapse of various European economies, Jose Manuel Barroso has used his position as President of the European Commission to
recommend the imposition of a European Superstate as the only effective
medicine left to hold the troubled 'Union' together. Resistance to this
solution is taken as an infringement of the spirit of the project and those
who dare to raise their voices as 'deniers'.
Sixty years on from the date of
the Monet letter and the framework of the envisioned superstate is pushed
into place.
As ailing Eurozone member states pledge their dwindling national assets to
the voracious demands of the IMF and ECB, the interest payments that the IMF
and ECB extract continue to fuel the financier led cabal's war chest.
Countries outside the Eurozone are now being asked to further top-up this
chest, because apparently there is not enough in it to prepare further
poisoned loan packages for the next victims.
What Jean Monet had in mind when he wrote his infamous letter, was the
carefully crafted, covert instigation of an ultimate power heist.
A heist
which firmly installs a small band of all powerful technocrats and oligarchs
in the undisputed driving seat of one of the largest trading blocks of the
planet. Under this regime, the sovereignty of nation states becomes
strategically weakened and so heavily dependent upon outside economic
support that it ultimately ceases to operate as a functional 'sovereign'
system.
Decisions of national importance once made via elected parliaments,
are usurped by the centralized control system based in Brussels, but
directly linked to,
-
London
-
New York
-
Washington
-
Frankfurt
-
Paris
-
Rome
-
Tokyo
Any country not part of this 'club' automatically becomes side-lined as a
second class nation with little or no right to sit on key committees and
influence the future.
The fiscal union club is held up as the holy grail by
which all nations must abide if they are to be members of the inner sanctum.
Under this regime transnational corporations, bankers and EU bureaucrats
flourish, while the working citizens of the EU are imprisoned in a modern
serfdom in which the banker controlled European Commission and member nation
states demand that the European labour force bail out the private banks by
accepting lower pay, later retirement and the loss of social services.
In this way, we (the people) are asked to carry the can and submit to the
austerity measures imposed upon us in order that governments can bail out
banks and banks can satisfy their Eurocrat pay masters ensconced behind
their mahogany desks at the European Financial Stability agency.
In close
proximity also sit the shadowy 'Frankfurt Group'.
According to Larry Elliot, economics correspondent of the Guardian, the
Frankfurt Group is,
an unelected cabal made up of eight people:
-
Lagarde
(IMF)
-
Merkel
-
Sarkozy
-
Mario Draghi (president of ECB)
-
Jose Manuel Barroso
(president European Commission)
-
Jean Claud Juncker (chairman Eurogroup)
-
Herman van Rompuy (president European Council)
-
Olli Rehn (Europe's
Economic and Moneytary affairs commissioner)
This group, which is
accountable to no one, calls the shots in Europe.
Given the free reign which this cabal now exercises in its management of
European (if not global) financial matters, its hardly surprising that money
and power constitute the overriding theme of Eurozone ambitions.
How many
times have you heard, over the past few months, heads of state declaring
that meetings must be concluded at such and such a time,
in order to give
the markets a clear message?
Please note: not the people
- but the markets. Everything, it now seems, is
beholden to 'the markets'. They have become a totem to which we are all
expected to bow our heads in obeisance. The pervasive consumption and growth
ideology and the covert lust for power which accompanies its pre-eminence
suggests a deep sickness reaching into the heart of society. A sickness
which gives license to the establishment of technocratic dictatorships and
the demotion of the instinct for democracy.
Jean Monet no doubt recognized this at the inception of the European Union.
Maybe he saw how a small group of well-schooled power seekers would be able
to engineer the economic collapse of countries that failed to fulfill the
diktats of the private club which he and his colleagues had instigated.
Was
it foreseen that it might be possible to achieve what
the Reichstag had
failed to achieve, but this time with little or no need for bloodshed?
In any event, gone is the Europe standing for a group of independent nation
states banding together when appropriate, on internationally significant
issues. The entire edifice of the extended family of nations called Europe,
has been brought to a point of crisis due to the artifice and brinkmanship
of the executors of this global power grab.
A power which now
controls the
media, the politicians, the market and the people.
We give them what we
make them think they want is an apt summary of the heist's blue print for
success.
In a world of mass media hype; virtual reality; 'shopping' as the
number one leisure pursuit, plus every conceivable gismo to play around
with; one can see how the artful creation of these superficial distractions
has combined to become such a powerful opiate.
Tragically, the bankrupt materialistic imagination of the modern European
fails to penetrate the veil of deceit which has allowed the clandestine
takeover to proceed so smoothly.
As Aldous Huxley warned in
Brave New World Revisited, 1958:
Democracy and Freedom will be the theme of every broadcast
and editorial. Meanwhile the ruling oligarchy and its highly trained elite
soldiers, police, thought-manufacturers and mind manipulators will quietly
run the show as they see fit.
So here we stand, on the edge of the precipice, yet mostly failing to
recognize that it is a precipice.
The federal superstate, currently managed
by the infamous 'troika', is closing around us, regardless of any nation's
membership or non-membership of the single currency regime.
This control
system works on the principle of keeping people just intelligent enough to
serve the system but not intelligent enough to recognize that it is a
system.
It has been largely successful in this mission, since up until now
we have been pacified into accepting the role of grudging servitude with few
signs of outward resistance.
However, all that may be about to change. 2012 looks set to be the crunch
year.
-
Signs of rebellion are appearing where once only the mists of sleep
prevailed.
-
The extremity of US and EU neo-colonial war mongering in Africa,
the Persian Gulf and Central Asia, is raising eyebrows if not a few hairs on
the nape of the neck.
-
Oil companies are turning in record profits; banks are
barely humbled by their carefree profligacy of 2008/9 and multi-millionaires
are created every week in extravagant game shows and lottery draws.
All this
while government instigated austerity packages are bearing down on citizens
struggling to make a reasonable living and hold onto some modicum of social
responsibility and decorum.
Something has to give. And probably more than
Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
Our long running pretence at being anything other than the schizoid and
hypocritical society that we are, is finally falling away. The bare bones of
the truth can no longer be disguised behind placatory rhetoric and artful
deception.
As the realization of what stands in front of us grows, we have a
very real choice to make:
stand on our own two feet and free ourselves from
the encircling tentacles of the Monet and Delors inspired supranational
dictatorship - or slide further under its control - losing our ability to
forge our destinies for generations to come.
The choice has never been so
stark.
It's down to each of us to reach into richer soils and ensure that
something altogether better is brought to birth.
