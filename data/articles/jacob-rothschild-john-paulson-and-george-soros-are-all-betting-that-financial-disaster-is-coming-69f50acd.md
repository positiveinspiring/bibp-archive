Are you willing to bet against three of the
wealthiest men in the entire world?
-
Jacob Rothschild recently bet
approximately 200 million dollars that the euro will go down.
-
Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson made somewhere around
20 billion dollars
betting against the U.S. housing market during the last financial
crisis, and now he has made huge bets that the euro will go down and
that the price of gold will go up.
-
As I wrote about
in
an article, George Soros put approximately 130 million
more dollars into gold last quarter.
So will the euro plummet like a rock? Will
the price of gold absolutely soar?
Well, if a massive financial disaster
does occur both of those two things are likely to happen. The European
economy is becoming more unstable with each passing day, and investors all
over the globe are looking for safe places to put their money.
The
mainstream media keeps telling us that everything is going to be okay, but
the global elite are sending us a much, much different message by their
actions. Certainly Rothschild, Paulson and Soros know about things
happening in the financial world that the rest of us don't. The fact that
they are all behaving in a consistent manner right now should be alarming
for all of us.
Let's start with
Jacob Rothschild. Apparently
he believes that the euro is headed for quite a tumble.
The following is
from a recent
CNBC article...
You know the
euro is in deep water when a doyen of the banking industry, Lord Jacob
Rothschild takes a Â£130 million ($200 million) bet against it.
Okay, but the euro has already been falling
dramatically.
In mid-2011, the EUR/USD was above the 1.40 mark, and right
now it is at about 1.23.
Does it really have that much more that it can
fall? If the Eurozone ends up breaking apart it sure
does.
If there is a Greek default, or if Germany
leaves the euro, or if a new currency comes along to replace the euro those
currently betting against it will end up looking like geniuses.
Another big name in the financial world that is
betting against the euro right now is
John Paulson.
The following is from a
recent
Der Spiegel article....
One of these
warriors is John Paulson. The hedge fund manager once made billions by
betting on a collapse of the American real estate market.
Not
surprisingly, the financial world sat up and took notice when Paulson,
who is now widely despised in America as a crisis profiteer, announced
in the spring that he would bet on a collapse of the euro.
And as I noted
in an article, Paulson has also been putting billions of dollars
into gold.
So just what are Rothschild and Paulson
anticipating? Could we be on the verge of a massive financial
collapse in Europe?
According to the Der Spiegel article mentioned
above, a lot of investors seem to be preparing for such a possibility right
now...
Banks,
companies and investors are preparing themselves for a collapse of the
euro. Cross-border bank lending is falling, asset managers are shunning
Europe and money is flowing into German real estate and bonds.
The euro
remains stable against the dollar because America has debt problems too.
But unlike the euro, the dollar's structure isn't in doubt.
The financial world is starting to wake up to
the fact that the globe is absolutely drowning in debt and it is not really
good to be holding fiat currencies when a debt crisis erupts.
When men like John Paulson and
George Soros
start pouring huge amounts of money into gold, it is time to start becoming
alarmed about the state of the global financial system.
The amount of money that these men are investing
in gold
is staggering...
There was
also news last week in an SEC filing that both George Soros and John
Paulson had increased their investment in SPDR Gold Trust, the worlds
largest publicly traded physical gold exchange traded fund (ETF).
Mr Soros
upped his stake in the ETF to 884,400 shares from 319,550 and Mr Paulson
bought 4.53m shares, bringing his stake to 21.3m.
At the
current price of about $156 a share, these are new investments of about
$88m of Mr Soros cash and more than $700m from Mr Paulsons funds.
These are significant positions.
And the central banks of the world are certainly
buying gold at an unprecedented rate as well.
According to
the World Gold Council, the central banks of the world added 157.5
metric tons of gold last quarter. That was the biggest move into gold by
the central banks of the globe that we have seen in modern financial
history.
But that might just be the beginning.
According to a recent
Marketwatch article, there are persistent rumors that China has plans to
buy thousands of metric tons of gold...
Within the
gold market, there is unconfirmed speculation that China plans to buy up
to at least 5,000 to 6,000 metric tons of gold and that it will start to
buy during this year, according to Kevin Kerr, president of Kerr Trading
International.
If China buys
this much gold, that would exceed annual, global production of gold, he
said. We do not have enough gold for China to buy that much, and it
will take China time to purchase this amount of gold.
So what comes next? Nobody is quite sure.
Another major financial crisis could erupt in
Europe at any moment.
A major war in the Middle East could start
literally
at any time.
Renowned investor Jim Rogers believes that
things are really going to get "bad
after the next election". Others believe that the action could start even
sooner than that.
The truth is that even though we have not seen a
"Lehman Brothers moment" yet, things in Europe just continue to get
progressively worse.
The following is from a recent article
by Mark E. Grant...
Whether you turn your attention to Greece, Spain, Italy,
Portugal or even Ireland; it is getting worse.
Nowhere on the Continent are things improving and even in France and
Germany the financial strains are beginning to show. It is not a
question of Euro-bear or Euro-bull; it is just the numbers as they come
rolling out month after month.
There is a growing realization in Europe that
the euro simply does not work.
Italy is absolutely drowning in debt,
the Spanish economy has basically descended into a depression, and
Greece has been experiencing depression-like conditions
for years at this point.
The euro is doomed. The only question is who is
going to blink first.
Nobody wants to be the first to leave the euro. There are rumblings that it could actually
be Finland that leaves the euro first, and that would please Germany
just fine because they don't want to look like the bad guys in all of this.
But that doesn't mean that Germany won't
eventually pull the trigger if nobody else does. The German public is sick
and tired of bailing out the weak sisters of southern Europe, and at this
point it looks like it would take perpetual bailouts just to keep the euro
together.
And recently there have been
lots of little signs that Germany is starting to move slowly toward the
exit doors.
In fact, I found it quite interesting that a
giant euro sculpture was
recently removed from the Frankfurt International Airport...
A massive
sculpture (identical to the one in front of the European Central Bank)
was dismantled and removed from the Frankfurt International Airport in
Germany Thursday.
The official
explanation is the plastic parts are getting weak after 11 years and
the terminal needed the space.
Does
sculptures removal from the Frankfurt Airport indicate Germany is
preparing for a surprise return to the Deutsche Mark?
Sure that might just be a coincidence, but it
also could be a harbinger of things to come.
Sadly, most average people living in North
America and Europe have absolutely no idea what is coming. Most of them
just want to be able to get up in the morning and go to work and pay the
bills and take care of their families.
Unfortunately, millions upon millions of those
hard working individuals are in for a very rude awakening.
A lot of people are about to have their current
lifestyles totally turned upside down. But it doesn't have to be all bad.
In fact, I found it very interesting to read
about how some young people are responding
to the depression in Greece...
In the spring
of 2010, just as the Greek government was embarking on some of its
harshest austerity measures, 29-year-old Apostolos Sianos packed in his
well-paid job as a website designer, gave up his Athens apartment and
walked away from modern civilisation.
In the
foothills of Mount Telaithrion on the Greek island of Evia, Mr Sianos
and three other like-minded Athenians set up an eco-community.
The idea was
to live in an entirely sustainable way, free from the ties of money and
cut off from the national electricity grid.
The group
sleeps communally in yurts they have built themselves, they grow their
own food and exchange the surplus in the nearest village for any
necessities they cannot produce.
I think there is a lesson to be learned there.
When the system fails, it is going to be
important to be able to live independently of the system. Governments and big banks all over the world
have been rapidly preparing for the coming financial collapse.
Perhaps the rest of us should be too.
If you can believe it, 77 percent of all
Americans live paycheck to paycheck
at least some of the time. If another major economic crisis comes along,
many of those people are going to be totally wiped out.
And there are already signs that the U.S.
economy is basically on life support at this point. Just look at the velocity of money. In an economy that is growing and healthy, money
tends to circulate very, very quickly.
But when an economy is sick, money tends to
circulate very slowly.
And that is exactly what is happening right
now. In fact, the velocity of money is currently at the lowest level in
modern U.S. history...
For much more discussion on this, please check
out
this article.
This is exactly what happened back in the
1930s. The velocity of money absolutely plummeted. When people are scared,
credit is tight and times are hard, money does not exchange hands as
rapidly.
But this is just the beginning.
What we are experiencing right now is
rip-roaring prosperity compared to what is coming.
Jacob Rothschild, John Paulson and George Soros
are preparing themselves for the tremendous chaos that is coming.
Are you getting prepared?
