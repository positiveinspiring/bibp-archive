According to SPIEGEL
research, United States intelligence agencies have not
only targeted Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone, but
they have also used the American Embassy in Berlin as a
listening station.
The revelations now pose a
serious threat
to German-American
relations.
Part 1
The NSA's Secret Spy Hub in Berlin
It's a prime site, a diplomat's dream. Is there
any better location for an embassy than Berlin's Pariser Platz? It's just a
few paces from here to the Reichstag. When the American ambassador steps out
the door, he looks directly onto the Brandenburg Gate.
When the United States moved into the massive
embassy building in 2008, it threw a huge party. Over 4,500 guests were
invited. Former President George H. W. Bush cut the red-white-and-blue
ribbon.
Chancellor Angela Merkel offered warm words for the occasion. Since then, when the
US ambassador receives high-ranking visitors, they often take a stroll out
to the roof terrace, which offers a breathtaking view of the Reichstag and
Tiergarten park. Even the Chancellery can be glimpsed. This is the political
heart of the republic, where billion-euro budgets are negotiated, laws are
formulated and soldiers are sent to war.
It's an ideal location for
diplomats - and for spies.
Research by SPIEGEL reporters in Berlin and
Washington, talks with intelligence officials and the evaluation of internal
documents of the US' National Security Agency and other information, most of
which comes from the archive of former NSA contractor
Edward Snowden, lead to the conclusion that the US diplomatic mission in
the German capital has not merely been promoting German-American friendship.
On the contrary, it is a nest of espionage.
From the roof of the embassy, a
special unit of the CIA and NSA can apparently monitor a large part of
cellphone communication in the government quarter. And there is evidence
that agents based at Pariser Platz recently targeted the cellphone that
Merkel uses the most.

a large part of
cell phone
communication in the government quarter.
The
NSA spying scandal has thus reached a new level, becoming a serious
threat to the trans-Atlantic partnership.
The mere suspicion that one of
Merkel's cellphones was being monitored by the NSA has led in the past week
to
serious tensions between Berlin and Washington.
Hardly anything is as sensitive a subject to
Merkel as the surveillance of her cellphone. It is her instrument of power.
She uses it not only to lead her party, the center-right Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), but also to conduct a large portion of government
business.
Merkel uses the device so frequently that there was even debate
earlier this year over whether her text-messaging activity should be
archived as part of executive action.
'That's Just Not Done'
Merkel has often said - half in earnest, half in
jest - that she operates under the assumption that her phone calls are being
monitored.
But she apparently had in mind countries like China and Russia,
where
data protection is not taken very seriously, and not Germany's friends
in Washington. Last Wednesday Merkel placed a strongly worded
phone call to US President
Barack Obama.
Sixty-two percent of Germans approve of her harsh
reaction, according to a survey by polling institute YouGov. A quarter think
it was too mild. In a gesture of displeasure usually reserved for rogue
states, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle
summoned the new US ambassador, John Emerson, for a meeting at the
Foreign Ministry.

The
NSA affair has shaken the certainties of German politics. Even Merkel's
CDU, long a loyal friend of Washington, is now openly questioning
the trans-Atlantic free trade agreement.
At the Chancellery it's now
being said that if the US government doesn't take greater pains to clarify
the situation, certain conclusions will be drawn and talks over the
agreement could potentially be put on hold.
"Spying between friends, that's just not done,"
said Merkel on Thursday at a European Union summit in Brussels. "Now
trust has to be rebuilt."
But until recently it sounded as if the government
had faith in its ally's intelligence agencies.
In mid-August Merkel's chief of staff, Ronald Pofalla, offhandedly described the NSA scandal as over. German authorities
offered none of their own findings - just a dry statement from the NSA
leadership saying the agency adhered to all agreements between the
countries.
The scandal unleashed
by these latest revelations has shaken the certainties of German politics,
possibly endangering
the long-anticipated trans-Atlantic free trade agreement.

ally.

the NSA scandal as finished.
Now it is not just
Pofalla who stands disgraced, but Merkel as well.
She appears like a head
of government who only stands up to Obama
when she herself is a
target of the US intelligence services.
Now it is not just Pofalla who stands disgraced,
but Merkel as well. She looks like a head of government who only stands up
to Obama when she herself is a target of the US intelligence services.
The
German website Der Postillon published a satirical version last
Thursday of the statement given by Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert:
"The
chancellor considers it a slap in the face that she has most likely been
monitored over the years just like some mangy resident of Germany."
Merkel has nothing to fear domestically from the
recent turn of affairs.
The election is over, the conservatives and the
center-left Social Democrats are already in
official negotiations toward forming a new government. No one wants to
poison the atmosphere with mutual accusation.
Nevertheless, Merkel must now answer the
question of how much she is willing to tolerate from her American allies.
Posing as Diplomats
A "top secret" classified NSA document from the
year 2010 shows that a unit known as the "Special Collection Service"
(SCS) is operational in Berlin, among other locations.
It is an elite corps run in concert by the US
intelligence agencies NSA and
CIA.
The secret list reveals that its agents are
active worldwide in around 80 locations, 19 of which are in Europe - cities
such as Paris, Madrid, Rome, Prague and Geneva. The SCS maintains two bases
in Germany, one in Berlin and another in Frankfurt. That alone is unusual.
But in addition, both German bases are equipped at the highest level and
staffed with active personnel.
The SCS teams predominantly work undercover in
shielded areas of the American Embassy and Consulate, where they are
officially accredited as diplomats and as such enjoy special privileges.
Under diplomatic protection, they are able to look and listen unhindered.
They just can't get caught.
Wiretapping from an embassy is illegal in nearly
every country. But that is precisely the task of the SCS, as is evidenced by
another secret document.
According to the document, the SCS operates its
own sophisticated listening devices with which they can intercept virtually
every popular method of communication: cellular signals, wireless networks
and satellite communication.
The necessary equipment is usually installed on
the upper floors of the embassy buildings or on rooftops where the
technology is covered with screens or Potemkin-like* structures that protect
it from prying eyes.
* Potemkin: word now used, typically in
politics and economics, to describe any construction (literal or figurative)
built solely to deceive others.
That is apparently the case in Berlin, as well.
SPIEGEL asked British investigative journalist Duncan Campbell to appraise
the setup at the embassy.
In 1976, Campbell uncovered the existence of the
British intelligence service GCHQ. In his so-called "The
ECHELON Report - Signals intelligence and human rights" in
1999, he described for the European Parliament the existence of the global
surveillance network of the same name.
Campbell refers to window-like indentations on
the roof of the US Embassy.
They are not glazed but rather veneered with
"dielectric" material and are painted to blend into the surrounding masonry.
This material is permeable even by weak radio signals. The interception
technology is located behind these radio-transparent screens, says Campbell.
The offices of SCS agents would most likely be
located in the same windowless attic.
No Comment from the NSA
This would correspond to internal NSA documents
seen by SPIEGEL.
They show, for example, an SCS office in another
US embassy - a small windowless room full of cables with a work station of
"signal processing racks" containing dozens of plug-in units for "signal
analysis."
On Friday, author and NSA expert James Bamford
also visited SPIEGEL's Berlin bureau, which is located on Pariser Platz
diagonally opposite the US Embassy.
"To me, it looks like NSA eavesdropping
equipment is hidden behind there," he said. "The covering seems to be
made of the same material that the agency uses to shield larger
systems."
The Berlin-based security expert Andy MÃ¼ller
Maguhn was also consulted.
"The location is ideal for intercepting
mobile communications in Berlin's government district," he says, "be it
technical surveillance of communication between cellphones and wireless
cell towers or radio links that connect radio towers to the network."
Apparently, SCS agents use the same technology
all over the world.
They can intercept cellphone signals while
simultaneously locating people of interest. One antenna system used by the
SCS is known by the affable code name "Einstein."

But documents show that
is precisely the task of the SCS.
The unit can apparently

while simultaneously

This "top secret"
NSA document shows what appears to be
an SCS antenna system
with the code name "Einstein"
and its corresponding
control device "Castanet."
When contacted by SPIEGEL, the NSA declined to
comment on the matter. The SCS are careful to hide their technology,
especially the large antennas on the roofs of embassies and consulates.
If
the equipment is discovered, explains a "top secret" set of classified
internal guidelines, it,
"would cause serious harm to relations
between the United States and a foreign government."
According to the documents, SCS units can also
intercept microwave and millimeter-wave signals.
The SCS teams
predominantly work undercover in shielded areas
of the American Embassy
and Consulate, where they are
officially accredited
as diplomats and as such enjoy special privileges.
Under diplomatic
protection, they are able to look and listen unhindered.
They just can't get
caught. Pictured here and in the next slide are extracts
from a secret NSA
document with guidelines for surveillance
based out of diplomatic
facilities.
The necessary equipment
is usually installed
on the upper floors of
the embassy buildings or on rooftops
where the technology is
covered with screens or Potemkin-like structures
that protect it from
prying eyes.
That is also apparently
the case in Berlin.
Some programs, such as one entitled
"Birdwatcher," deal primarily with encrypted communications in foreign
countries and the search for potential access points. Birdwatcher is
controlled directly from SCS headquarters in Maryland.
With the growing importance of the Internet, the
work of the SCS has changed.
Some 80 branches offer "thousands of
opportunities on the net" for web-based operations, according to an internal
presentation. The organization is now able not only to intercept cellphone
calls and satellite communication, but also to proceed against criminals or
hackers.
From some embassies, the Americans have planted
sensors in communications equipment of the respective host countries that
are triggered by selected terms.
This "top secret" NSA
document outlines the SCS unit's capabilities.
Another secret list
seen by SPIEGEL reveals that
its agents are active
worldwide in around 80 locations,
19 of which are in
Europe - cities such as Paris, Madrid, Rome, Prague and Geneva.
The SCS maintains two
bases in Germany, one in Berlin and another in Frankfurt.
That alone is unusual.
But in addition, both
German bases are equipped at
the highest level and
staffed with active personnel.
Part 2
How the Scandal Began
There are strong indications that it was the SCS
that targeted Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone.
This is suggested by a document that apparently
comes from an NSA database in which the agency records its targets. This
document, which SPIEGEL has seen, is what set the cellphone scandal in
motion.
The document contains Merkel's cellphone number. An inquiry to her team
revealed that it is the number the chancellor uses mainly to communicate
with party members, ministers and confidants, often by text message. The
number is, in the language of the NSA, a "Selector Value."
The next two fields determine the format ("raw
phone number") and the "Subscriber," identified as "GE Chancellor Merkel."
In the next field, labeled "Ropi," the NSA defines who is interested in the
German chancellor: It is the department S2C32.
-
"S" stands for "Signals Intelligence
Directorate," the NSA umbrella term for signal reconnaissance.
-
"2" is the agency's department for
procurement and evaluation.
-
"C32" is the unit responsible for Europe,
the "European States Branch."
So the order apparently came down from Europe
specialists in charge of signal reconnaissance.
The time stamp is noteworthy. The order was transferred to the "National
Sigint Requirements List," the list of national intelligence targets, in
2002.
That was the year Germany held closely
watched parliamentary elections and Merkel battled Edmund Stoiber of
Bavaria's Christian Social Union to become the conservatives' chancellor
candidate. It was also the year the Iraq crisis began heating up.
The document also lists status: "A" for active.
This status was apparently valid a few weeks
before President Obama's Berlin visit in June 2013.
Finally, the document defines the units tasked with implementing the order:
the "Target Office of Primary Interest":
"F666E."
"F6" is the NSA's internal name for the global
surveillance unit, the "Special Collection Service."
Thus, the NSA would have targeted Merkel's cellphone for more than a decade,
first when she was just party chair, as well as later when she'd become
chancellor. The record does not indicate what form of surveillance has taken
place.
Were all of her conversations recorded or just
connection data? Were her movements also being recorded?
'Intelligence Target
Number One'
Among the politically decisive questions is whether the spying was
authorized from the top: from the US president.
If the data is accurate, the operation was
authorized under former President
George W. Bush and his NSA chief,
Michael
Hayden. But it would have had to be repeatedly approved, including after
Obama took office and up to the present time.
Is it conceivable that the NSA made the German
chancellor a surveillance target without the president's knowledge?
The White House and the US intelligence agencies periodically put together a
list of priorities. Listed by country and theme, the result is a matrix of
global surveillance:
The list is called the "National
Intelligence Priorities Framework" and is "presidentially approved."
One category in this list is "Leadership Intentions," the goals and
objectives of a country's political leadership.
The intentions of China's
leadership are of high interest to the US government. They are marked with a
"1" on a scale of 1 to 5. Mexico and Brazil each receive a "3" in this
category.
Germany appears on this list as well.
The US intelligence agencies are
mainly interested in the country's economic stability and foreign policy
objectives (both "3"), as well as in its advanced weapons systems and a few
other sub-items, all of which are marked "4."
The "Leadership Intention" field is empty.
So
based on the list, it wouldn't appear that Merkel should be monitored.
Former NSA employee Thomas Drake does not see this as a contradiction.
"After the attacks of
September 11, 2001,
Germany became intelligence target number one in Europe," he says.
The US government did not trust Germany, because
some of the Sept. 11 suicide pilots had lived in Hamburg.
Evidence suggests that the NSA recorded Merkel
once and then became intoxicated with success, says Drake.
"It has always been the NSA's motto to
conduct as much surveillance as possible," he adds.
A Political Bomb
When SPIEGEL confronted the government on Oct. 10 with evidence that the
chancellor's cellphone had been targeted, the German security apparatus
became deeply unsettled.
The Chancellery ordered the country's foreign intelligence agency, the
Federal Intelligence Service (BND), to scrutinize the information.
In
parallel, Christoph Heusgen, Merkel's foreign policy adviser, also contacted
his US counterpart, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, to tell her about SPIEGEL's research, which had been summarized on a single sheet of paper.
Rice said she would look into it.
Shortly afterwards, German security authorities got back to the Chancellery
with a preliminary result:
The numbers, dates and secret codes on the
paper indicated the information was accurate.
It was probably some kind of form from an
intelligence agency department requesting surveillance on the chancellor's
cellphone, they said.
At this point, a sense of nervousness began to grow at
government headquarters. It was clear to everyone that if the Americans were
monitoring Merkel's phone, it would be a political bomb.
But then Rice called the Chancellery on Friday evening to explain that if
reports began to circulate that Merkel's phone had been targeted, Washington
would deny it - or at least that is how the Germans understood the message.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney assured
his counterpart, Merkel's spokesperson Steffen Seibert, of the same thing.
The message was passed on to SPIEGEL late that evening without comment, at
which point editors decided to continue investigating.
With this, both the US agencies and Berlin won themselves more time to come
up with a battle plan for approaching the deep crisis of confidence between
the two countries. And it was clearly already a crisis of confidence,
because Berlin obviously doubted the statements coming from the US and
hadn't called off its probe. And, as later became clear, there were also
inquiries taking place in the US, despite the denial from Rice.
Over the weekend, the tide turned.
Rice contacted Heusgen once again, but this time her voice sounded less
certain. She said that the possibility the chancellor's phone was under
surveillance could only be ruled out currently and in the future. Heusgen
asked for more details, but was put off.
The chief adviser to the president on Europe,
Karen Donfried, and the Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia
at the US State Department, Victoria Nuland, would provide further
information midweek, he was told.
By this time it was clear to the Chancellery
that if Obama's top security adviser no longer felt comfortable ruling out
possible surveillance, this amounted to confirmation of their suspicions.
Going on the Offensive
This detail only served to intensify the catastrophe.
Not only had supposed friends monitored the
chancellor's cellphone, which was bad enough on its own, but leaders in
Berlin were also left looking like a group of amateurs. They had believed
the assurances made this summer by Obama, who downplayed the notion of
spying in Germany on a visit to Berlin.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich
had even gone so far as to say at the time that Germany's concerns had
"dissipated."
On Tuesday morning Merkel decided to go on the offensive. She had seen how
strongly French President FranÃ§ois Hollande had reacted to allegations that
US intelligence agencies had conducted widespread surveillance on French
citizens.
Hollande called Obama immediately to air his anger. Merkel now
wanted to speak with Obama personally too - before her planned meeting with
Hollande at the upcoming EU summit in Brussels.
Heusgen made a preliminary call to Obama to let him know that Merkel planned
to make some serious complaints, with which she would then go public. At
stake was control over the political interpretation of one of the year's
most explosive news stories.
Merkel spoke with Obama on Wednesday afternoon, calling him from her secure
landline in her Chancellery office. Both spoke English. According to the
Chancellery, the president said that he had known nothing of possible
monitoring, otherwise he would have stopped it.
Obama also expressed his deepest regrets and
apologized.
Around 5:30 p.m. the same day, Merkel's chief of staff, Pofalla, informed
two members of the Parliamentary Control Panel, the body in Germany's
parliament charged with keeping tabs on the country's intelligence agencies,
of what was going on.
At the same time, the administration went public with
the matter. It contacted SPIEGEL first with a statement containing Merkel's
criticism of possible spying on her cellphone.
Her spokesman Seibert called it a "grave breach
of trust" - a choice of phrase seen as the highest level of verbal
escalation among allied diplomats.
Part 3
Surprising Unscrupulousness
The scandal revives an old question: Are the
German security agencies too trusting of the Americans?
Until now, German
agencies have typically concerned themselves with China and Russia in their
counterintelligence work, for which the domestic intelligence agency, the
Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BFV), is responsible.
A year ago, there was already debate between the agencies, the Interior
Ministry and the Chancellery over whether Germany should be taking a harder
look at what American agents were up to in the country. But the idea was
jettisoned because it seemed too politically sensitive.
The main question at
the time came down to whether monitoring allies should be allowed.
Even to seasoned German intelligence officials, the revelations that have
come to light present a picture of surprising unscrupulousness. It's quite
possible that the BFV could soon be tasked with investigating the activities
of the CIA and NSA.
The ongoing spying scandal is also fueling allegations that the Germans have
been allowing the NSA to lead them around by the nose. From the beginning of
the NSA scandal, Berlin has conducted its attempts to clarify the
allegations with a mixture of naivety and ignorance.
Letters with anxious questions were sent, and a group of government
department leaders traveled to Washington to meet with Director of National
Intelligence James Clapper. The BND was also commissioned with negotiating a
"no-spying pact" with the US agencies. In this way, Merkel's government
feigned activity while remaining largely in the dark.
In fact, it relied
primarily on the assurance from the US that its intentions were good.
It also seems to be difficult for German intelligence agencies to actually
track the activities of the NSA. High-level government officials admit the
Americans' technical capabilities are in many ways superior to what exists
in Germany. At the BFV domestic intelligence agency, for example, not even
every employee has a computer with an Internet connection.
But now, as a consequence of the spying scandal, the German agencies want to
beef up their capabilities.
"We're talking about a fundamental realignment
of counterintelligence," said one senior security official.
There are
already more than 100 employees at the BFV responsible for
counterintelligence, but officials are hoping to see this double.
One focus of strategic considerations is the embassy buildings in central
Berlin.
"We don't know which roofs currently have spying equipment
installed," says the security official. "That is a problem."
Trade Agreement at Risk?
When the news of Merkel's mobile phone being tapped began making the rounds,
the BND and the BSI, the federal agency responsible for information
security, took over investigation of the matter.
There too, officials have
been able to do nothing more than ask questions of the Americans when such
sensitive issues have come up in recent months.
But now German-American relations are threatened with an ice age. Merkel's
connection to Obama wasn't particularly good before the spying scandal. The
chancellor is said to consider the president overrated - a politician who
talks a lot but does little, and is unreliable to boot.
One example, from Berlin's perspective, was the military operation in Libya
almost three years ago, which Obama initially rejected.
When then-Secretary
of State
Hillary Clinton convinced him to change his mind, he did so without
consulting his allies. Berlin saw this as evidence of his fickleness and
disregard for their concerns.
The chancellor also finds Washington's regular advice on how to solve the
euro crisis irritating. She would prefer not to receive instruction from the
country that caused
the collapse of the global financial system in the first
place.
Meanwhile, the Americans have been annoyed for years that Germany
isn't willing to do more to boost the world economy.
Merkel also feels as though she was duped. The Chancellery now plans once
again to review the assurances of US intelligence agencies to make sure they
are abiding by the law.
The chancellor's office is also now considering the possibility that the
much-desired trans-Atlantic free trade agreement could fail if the NSA
affair isn't properly cleared up.
Since the latest revelations came out,
some 58 percent of Germans say they support breaking off ongoing talks,
while just 28 percent are against it.
"We should put the negotiations for a
free-trade agreement with the US on ice until the accusations against the NSA have been clarified," says Bavarian Economy Minister Ilse Aigner, a
member of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's
Christian Democrats.
Outgoing Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger has used the
scandal as an excuse to appeal to the conscience of her counterpart in
Washington, Attorney General Eric Holder.
"The citizens rightly expect that
American institutions also adhere to German laws. Unfortunately, there are a
number of indications to the contrary," she wrote in a letter to Holder last
week.
EU Leaders Consider Consequences
The American spying tactics weren't far from the minds of leaders at the EU
summit in Brussels last Thursday, either.
French President Hollande was the
first to bring it up at dinner, saying that while he didn't want to demonize
the intelligence agencies, the Americans had so blatantly broken the law on
millions of counts that he couldn't imagine how things could go on this way.
Hollande called for a code of conduct among the intelligence agencies, an
idea for which Merkel also showed support.
But soon doubts emerged:
British
Prime Minister David Cameron pointed out how many terror attacks had been
prevented because of spying capabilities.
Then it was asked whether it has
been proven that Obama even knows what his agencies are doing. Suddenly,
mutual understanding seemed to waft through the group.
That was a bit too rich for Hollande:
No, he interjected, spying to such an
immense degree, allegedly on more than 70 million phone calls per month in
France alone - that has been undertaken by only one country: the United
States.
The interruption was effective.
After nearly three hours, the EU
member states agreed on a statement that can be read as clear disapproval of
the Americans.
Merkel no longer wants to rely solely on promises. This week
GÃ¼nter Heiss,
Chancellor Merkel's intelligence coordinator, will travel to Washington.
Heiss wants the Americans finally to promise a contract excluding mutual
surveillance.
The German side already announced its intention to sign on to
this no-spying pact during the summer, but the US government has so far
shown little inclination to seriously engage with the topic.
This is, of course, also about the chancellor's cellphone. Because despite
all the anger, Merkel still didn't want to give up using her old number as
of the end of last week. She was using it to make calls and to send text
messages.
Only for very delicate conversations did she switch to a secure
line.
