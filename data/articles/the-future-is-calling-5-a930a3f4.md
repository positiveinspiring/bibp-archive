An Idea Whose Time Has Come

There is no point in worrying about the erosion of personal freedom that is
the reality of our present era if we can do nothing about it.
They say that
knowledge is power, but that is one of the greatest myths of all history.
Knowledge without action is useless and leads only to apathy and despair. So
the question is: what type of action can reverse this trend? Writing letters
and signing petitions to the same people who have created the problem is not
going to do it.
Voting for candidates selected by power brokers with hidden
agendas will not do it either. There have been many proposals to reverse the
tide of totalitarianism but, after decades of effort, none of them have
worked.
In this address, G. Edward Griffin, Founder of Freedom Force, tells
us why; and the reason is so simple, it will astound you.
Once we clear away
that single barrier, the plan for a pro-active counter-force falls quickly
into place. This is the missing piece of the puzzle, the ultimate solution
we have been seeking.
The solution is simple. It is to take back control of the power centers of
society, one-by-one, just the way they were captured in the first place.
Replace the collectivists with people who have no personal agendas except to
defend freedom.
This will unleash the vast human potential for prosperity
and happiness that can be realized only in the absence of government
oppression. However, to reach that goal, it will be necessary for those who
cherish freedom to do more than complain and far more than just casting a
vote every few years. They must reach for power.
That is the reason for the
motto of Freedom Force: Impotentes defendere libertatem non possunt, which
is Latin for "Those without power cannot defend freedom."
