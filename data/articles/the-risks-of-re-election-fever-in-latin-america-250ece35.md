# The Risks of Re-Election Fever in Latin America

On Nov. 6, Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega of the ruling Sandinista National Liberation
Front, or FSLN, was re-elected to a third consecutive term, his
fourth overall since 1984.
There was
little doubt about the outcome of the election given his
overwhelming popularity and the lack of any viable opposition.
Though Nicaragua's characteristically high voter turnout was
down to 68 percent, Ortega
won 72 percent of the vote.
But Ortega's route to re-election has not been without
controversy. Critics point to the erosion of democratic
institutions and principles over his past two administrations.
In 2010, the country's Supreme Court cleared the way for his
re-election by declaring the constitution's prohibition on
re-election "inapplicable."
In 2014, a constitutional amendment
provided for indefinite re-election, while victories at the
ballot box in 2011 and 2012 ensured that the FSLN controlled the
country's institutions.
Court decisions in 2016 transferred
leadership of the main opposition party to a historical faction
within the party; its deputies were then required to vacate
their seats in the National Assembly after they refused to
recognize or meet with the new party leadership.
For his detractors, Ortega naming
his wife, Rosario Murillo, as vice-president was merely the coup
de grace to the facade of democracy in Nicaragua.
Ortega's immense popularity has rendered much of this criticism
moot, though. He routinely enjoys approval ratings of more than
70 percent - the highest for any president in the hemisphere.
Whether Ortega can hold onto this popularity remains to be seen.
Some factors are out of his control:
The crisis in Venezuela, for
example, threatens access to low-interest loans used to fund
vital and popular social programs. While financial and
investment forecasts remain positive for Nicaragua, cuts to
those programs could undermine Ortega's popularity.
Nicaragua is one of several Latin
American countries that have amended laws on term limits and
re-elections in recent years, including,
-
Bolivia
-
Colombia
-
Costa Rica
Following the region's transitions
to democracy in the 1980s, many new civilian constitutions
prohibited consecutive re-election, while a few permitted a
single nonconsecutive term.
The prohibitions were a response to
military regimes and dictatorships during the 1960s and 1970s.
But less than a decade later,
countries throughout the region began to amend these rules. Now,
most countries allow presidents to be elected more than once, in
some form - either two consecutive terms or nonconsecutive
terms.
Only,
-
Guatemala
-
Mexico
-
Paraguay,
...prohibit re-elections altogether, while only Nicaragua and
Venezuela permit indefinite re-election.
Last February, a bid by
Bolivian President Evo Morales to run for another term was
defeated in a popular referendum, but Morales said this week
that
he anticipated another referendum on re-election would be
held soon.
In 2015, Honduras became the latest Latin American country to
allow a president to be re-elected when the Honduran Supreme
Court,
in a rather dubious ruling, overturned a constitutional ban.
That cleared the way for President
Juan Orlando Hernandez
to run again, and last week he accepted the nomination of
the ruling National Party to be its candidate in next year's
elections.
His announcement comes in spite of
the fact that no legal procedures have been approved for
re-election. Honduras' Congress has yet to determine whether
re-election will be permitted for consecutive or nonconsecutive
terms. Nor has it fixed the number of permissible terms.
Moreover, despite the court's
ruling, the language banning re-election is still in the
constitution, and there's no clear sense of a procedure to
change it.
Across Latin America,
many citizens see
legislatures
as impediments for
progress;
for some they are even
expendable.
Opposition leaders and members
of civil society oppose Hernandez's nomination, claiming the
ruling is not valid because the court does not have the power to
amend the constitution.
Student protesters opposing
his re-election bid
have clashed with police in recent days.
Making matters worse is the fact that former Honduran President
Manuel Zelaya was ousted in a coup in June 2009 after he
attempted to schedule a poll on whether to hold a referendum on
amending the constitution, potentially to rewrite the rules on
re-election.
The opposition claimed that
Zelaya's move was a Chavez-style attempt to hold onto power,
despite the fact that the poll would not have had any impact on
the elections already scheduled for later that year.
That same opposition now
supports Hernandez's re-election, while Zelaya's left-wing Libre
party opposes it.
So far the U.S. reaction to Hernandez's bid has been neutral.
A statement from the
U.S. Embassy in Honduras read,
"The U.S. Government does not
oppose President Hernandez or others from presenting
themselves for re-election according to the Honduran
democratic processes. It is up to the Honduran people to
determine their political future through their democratic
institutions and processes."
This is curious given that
Hernandez used a court that he stacked with partisans to get the
re-election ruling he wanted - the same scenario that resulted
in
scathing U.S. criticism of Ortega.
What does this re-election trend reveal about Latin America? One
explanation is that the region has become increasingly
comfortable with democracy, and there's little concern that
today's democratic leaders will attempt to keep themselves in
power at all costs.
After all, only in a handful
of circumstances have Latin American presidents sought to extend
their time in office - such as Venezuela's Huge Chavez and
Colombia's Alvaro Uribe, along with Morales and Ortega - and not
all of them have been successful.
But another explanation is that Latin America's democracies are
hyper-presidential, giving presidents significant leeway to
govern as they see fit.
This system is supported by
popular attitudes toward government institutions. Across Latin
America, many citizens see legislatures as impediments for
progress; for some
they are even expendable.
But analysts like the
Brookings Institution's Daniel Zovatto
warn of the danger that this combination of
hyper-presidentialism and re-election poses to liberal democracy
in the region.
Whatever the explanation, numerous Latin American leaders have
come to view themselves as indispensable. Ortega has been the
FSLN's sole presidential candidate since 1984, running in a
total of seven elections.
Some view Ortega's appointment
of his wife as his vice president as an attempt to cement a line
of succession, and he wouldn't be alone in doing so.
Other recent first ladies have
succeeded their husbands in office, like Cristina Fernandez de
Kirchner in Argentina, or attempted to, like Sandra Torres in
Guatemala.
Earlier this year, Keiko
Fujimori, the daughter of Peru's former President Alberto
Fujimori, who also served as Peru's first lady, lost her second
bid to become president. Of course, Fujimori himself also had
controversial re-election bids.
In Honduras last week, Zelaya
announced that his wife, Xiomara Castro, who ran against
Hernandez in 2013, would be Libre's 2017 presidential candidate.
If the re-election trend reveals anything, it is the presence of
a small clique of presidential hopefuls that have been aided by
a lack of political competition and credible opposition.
Latin America's political
parties have long been viewed as vehicles for self-promotion,
nepotism and corruption; the re-election trend does little to
dispel that perception.
If they are to survive, opposition
parties need to develop deeper roots and cultivate new leaders
for the future.
