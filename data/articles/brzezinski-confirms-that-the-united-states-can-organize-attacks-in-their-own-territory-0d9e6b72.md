With the exception of Washington Note and
Financial Times, the mainstream media decided not to report
Zbigniew Brzezinskis comments that shatter the United Stator ruling
class. Auditioned on February 1st, 2007 by the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations, the former National Security Adviser read a statement
the terms of which had been carefully chosen.
He indicated that:
"a plausible scenario for a military
collision with Iran involves Iraqi failure to meet the benchmarks,
followed by accusations of Iranian responsibility for the failure, then
by some provocation in Iraq or a terrorist act in the US blamed on Iran,
culminating in a defensive US military action against Iran that
plunges a lonely America into a spreading and deepening quagmire
eventually ranging across Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan".
As you must have noticed: Mr Brzezinski evoked
the
Bush administration
plausible organization of an attack in the United States, and the
possibility of holding Iran wrongly responsible for it.
In Washington the analysts hesitate between two interpretations of this
statement. For certain officials, the former National Security Adviser tried
to beat the neoconservatives to it and to cast doubt in advance on any
circumstance which would lead to the war.
For others, Mr Brzezinski wanted, in addition,
to suggest that in case of collision with the war partisans, he could
reopen the September 11th file.
In any case, Thierry Meyssans hypothesis -
according to which the September 11th attacks would have been perpetrated by
a Military-Industrial Complex faction to provoke the Afghanistan and Iraq
wars - leaves suddenly the taboo domain to be discussed publicly by
Washington elites.
