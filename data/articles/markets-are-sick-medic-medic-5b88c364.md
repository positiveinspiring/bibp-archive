# Markets Are Sick - Medic! Medic!

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/sociopol_globalbanking133.htm

As 2010 fades rapidly from sight, and mind,
we note that the Markets entity is pretty much as its primary supporting
descriptors would have it, a [basket (of) crises (struggling) to not
overturn].
The [basket-case markets] set has secondary support coming
from [interwoven] and [inextricably twined] which are themselves both
supported at their primary levels by [bad foods] which, given its
supporting sets, we are interpreting as [indigestible products].
These [indigestible (financial) products]
are about to make [minions (within markets)] go into [spasms] of
[violent puking]. This is indicated to be a [planet wide] level event
that in its turn brings [international grievances] and [inter country
tensions] to a [visible] and [frightening] level that will be described
(in the msm propaganda press) as being a [boil over] situation.
The interpretation that we have about the
[indigestible products] is that they fall into the category of
[derivatives] in general, but specifically there are linguistics around
the idea of a [gold price tied/bound] form of [derivative] that [fails]
in an [instant] due to a [crisis] in the [gold/precious metals market].
This forecast is based on a lot of immediacy
data value sets and so may be within days of happening, and likely will
be occurring by the time that this Shape report is published.
Both the shorter term (3/three weeks out
through 3/three months) and longer term (4/four months to 19/nineteen
months) within the Markets entity are pointing to a [change of state
(condition)] for the [usofa dollar]. The [change of condition] is
indicated to be [directly preceding] the [completion] of the [usofa
dollar (as global reserve currency].
This [global completion] is itself a
temporal marker for the [crumbling/degradation] of the [federal reserve
criminal cabal]. Further, the [completion] of the [usofa dollar] is also
a temporal marker for the [political (infrastructure) crisis] that is
described as [wrenching] and [twisting] the [political structure] into
[dysfunction]. The [dysfunction] sub set is supported at the primary
level by a complex descriptor set labeled [slated (entombed)].
This supporting set is large, and complex,
and complicated.
The label was chosen due to the overall
impression of a [government/officialdom] that will [self isolate] or
[self entombed]. The [self isolation] aspect/attribute set is supported
by [fleeing (from) responsibility]. This [flight from] sub set is also
supporting several other sets both in the Populace/USofA entity and the
Markets entity that go to actual [flights (to avoid) responsibility].
It is 'mere' coincidence of universe that this Shape of Things To Come
report is to be published on the same day as the State of the Union
speech from [officialdom] here in US. It is not coincidence that there
are rumors of [change of dollar state] language circulating the internet
prior to the speech.
The previous Shape reports of 2010 have been
pointing to early 2011 for the 'unexpected bump in the road' for the
[populace (mostly sheeple)] relative to the [dollar] and [global
currencies] in general. It would seem from the language expressed in the
rumors about pending, and perhaps 'hidden' messages in the State of the
Union speech, that prescient mental triggers are going off in large
numbers of people and that these are finding expression on the internet.
Within the Markets entity language sets,
there are repeated sets that include [waiting], and [anticipating], and
[tingling (skin)], and [stiff (no, not that, but hairs)], and other
references to human body parts that are seemingly [hypersensitive] to a
'something' that is clearly being felt across the collective psychic
antenna.
The Markets entity continues to point toward [dollar (currency)
depression] as the cause of the jittery feeling expressing itself as
rumor. The [dollar death] sub sets grow rapidly from late Winter through
Spring, with several large [social order events] taking place during
this period.
Some of the [dollar impacting] events are
shown in cross links over to the Terra entity where the sheer number of
Terra 'intrusions' over 2011 is indicated to be a major factor in the
global economy taken on its own. But wait, there is more, compounding
the [alterations forced on business] by the [terra intrusions], will be
a truly [bizarre] set of [direct human impacts].
These [direct human impacts] {ed note:
discussed in other areas of this report} are, within the Markets entity,
showing as [causing], some soon-to-be-notorious, and highly [visible],
[bad decisions]. Some of the [decisions] are to be so [beyond
understanding] that there will be some [public calls (by interested
parties)] for [do-overs], or [reset on the markets].
The sub sets for the [precious metals] {ed note: does not include the
rare earths or other metallic minerals soon to be more 'precious' than
gold. These precious metals are gold, silver, and the platinum group}
are showing that a [great (leaping past/over coming)] of
[(decayed/weakening) limiting corruption] is pending.
The accruing aspect/attribute sets in
support of the primary supporting set of [great leap overturning past
constraints] include [internal (to markets) corruption] and [external
(to banks) corruption] that in both instances show [sagging (support)
for (the) secrecy veil] and [imminent (threat of) exposure].
These sets of [corruption] aspect/attributes
have, in previous ALTA and Shape reports, contained cross links
indicating [church of rome] involvement within the [banking corruption],
as well as [politicians (minions)] also being [tainted]. Now the data
accretion patterns are suggesting that [shit (will be) rolling down]
from the [seven hills of rome (including the sorcerers palace =
vatican)].
The data sets are suggesting that upcoming [bankster
suicides], as well as [mysterious transportation crashes] of an
[international nature] will be a result of attempts to [chop (the) chain
(of evidence)] and [curtail (the) exposure (of the) corruption].
The [precious metals] sub sets gain support from directly held
aspect/attributes for [success], and [jumping (from the building) before
(the roof breaks inward)]. Other supporting language includes [leaps
(over obstacles)] during a [blazing Spring]. Note though that problems
will exist at [governmental levels] for [precious metals (and owners?)]
later in 2011, probably in Fall.
For this Spring however, the directly
held sets include [everyone (will) regret laziness (to not get
gold/silver)]. Further aspect/attribute sets include [distractions (of)
youth (= political passions)] will be [regretted] when [older (and have)
no coins (of silver)]. Further language gains along this line are also
being seen within the [panic to own ] sub set that has been building
since 2003.
However, the largest accretions of supporting sets for the
[precious metals ] sub sets go to the [unleashing (of hidden secrets)],
and [exposure (of treasure hiding)]. This last is internally supported
by [international], and [banksters], and [central banks]. The [central
banks] sub set is itself supported in this case by [crime (against one's
fellow) criminals].
In this set the details suggest that [one (amongst)
the central banks] has been [hiding the stash (within the sleeve)] and
is/has been a [secret gold horder].
As model-space is progressed from Winter 2010/2011 into Spring 2011, the
[dollar (federal reserve system note)] has as its primary supporting
set, the descriptor of [dangerous situation]. There are supporting sets
for [looking out (just over the next rise/hill)] for [backwardization
(*of unknown focus, but a commercial asset type)], and a [document (of
indebtedness - derivative?)] which will be [triggered/invoked].
These
sets have accrual patterns suggesting that some form of large scale
[failure to perform] within [documents (debt notes)] held by (or issued
by?) [sovereign states] will be the [proximate cause] of a [cascading
default]. The [cascading default] in in the supporting sets for [dollar
debacle] that will involve or cause an [emergency international
meeting].
However note that elsewhere in this report, [international
travel] is cited as a potential [problem] for [currency flows].
There are a number of [dollar death] sub sets that are temporally linked
to [terra changes]. These include [earthquakes], and [new oceanic
phenomena]. In the Markets entity a couple of the long forecast [new
electrics] sub sets are now gaining both supporting sub sets as well as
[visibility] within the msm = the stooge press licking the backsides of
TPTB/W.
These [new electrics] sub sets are pointing to both [south africa], and [canada] as becoming [more visible] within the [portable
power from over unity devices] markets due to [strategic materials] to
be found in those countries. The data would seem to be suggesting that
this [formative technology] does its [emergence] with some significant
[visibility] in 2011.
For the Markets entity, 2011 is going to be
[shit]. Or [the shits]. Or [the vomiting (unto/like purging out one's
bowels through the mouth]. Hmmm...wonder what this may mean for the banksters and their cousins? All of the above language being found
within the secondary support layers for the Markets entity.
As modelspace is progressed into Spring, the data sets accrue with
[disruption (in commercial/products/financial) flows] that come from a
number of sources.
Not only the Terra intrusions, but also [corruption
investigations] seemingly [sprouting from the ground] will be [impeding
the flow] of [stolen funds]. The [stolen funds] sub set has both cross
links and a directly held mirror within the SpaceGoatFarts entity, where
it also is reflecting the [stolen funds shrinkage] as a linguistic
structure with very high emotional sums.
The [stolen funds] sub set,
within Markets entity, is perceived as negative both due to the [loss of
income], but also separately for the [reduction (in the) flow of monies
(to be laundered?)].
The Markets entity brings in negative language in all three data types
starting with the immediacy value sets that have supporting details for
[yet more (scandals)] around [money (currency) theft]. In the immediacy
sets, the primary level of support is for [pharmaceuticals scandals] to
impact [supplies] of [drugs]. The [drug supply reduction] is indicated
to be a [trigger] for yet more [visibility] on the part of the [congress
critters] as they ['deal'] with [yet more reductions (in 'lifestyle')]
for [american populace].
The data sets are still building for [severe reductions (in percentage
of planetary resources consumed by american populace)]. Unlike the
[announced austerity programs] in [europe] and elsewhere that have
triggered riots and protests, the Markets entity, both direct, and
through cross links to the Populace/USofA entity, is indicating that a
form of [sneaky austerity] will be initiated by [corporations] doing
business in the [usofa].
The data includes descriptors for [shelves
empty], and [half filled (delivery) trucks]. These and other linguistics
for [delivery slow down] will all apparently be [blamed] on [global
economics], rather than [deliberately (by suppliers) shifting
resources].
The Markets entity also has extensive cross links to the SpaceGoatFarts*
entity connecting yet another [reduction] set of linguistics.
* SpaceGoatFarts (SGF)
This entity is newly formed. While references to Space Goat Farts have
appeared within Terra, sub set Space in the past, the data set now
demonstrates a need for an entity to allow for the growth of 'unknown
forces of all kinds from space which are terra/populace affecting'.
Includes non-earth based, non-human/non-mammal intelligent beings
usually considered as 'space aliens' or 'extraterrestrials'.
Created during 1207 clean up.
In this
case, the idea coming across is that some [new players] or [new buyers]
entering the [gray markets] of the planet, and the [new money] will be
[noticed]. The data suggests that the [gray markets] will also [feel]
and [react] to the [withdrawal] of the [siphoned funds].
This last is
indicating that the [parasitism of the hidden civilization] will have
several levels of effects within the [markets] at both levels of
[illegality (approved = wallstreet/banksters), (marginalized = gray
markets)].
The [banksters] sub set is showing that the [last great
grunch (homage to Bucky Fuller) of the giants] has been [digested], and
now the data sets are showing that [shit] in the [system] is about to
[explode outward]. In 14/fourteen of the top supporting sets there are
explicit references to body functions, the majority of these are
[digestive process] focused.
Probably this is not a good sign.
The forecast bird and fishes die off (posted in
ALTA 1309 report in mid 2009
with the very early 2011 timeframe as a target for manifestation), has
brought a number of questions to the fore.
Some conclusions can (maybe)
safely drawn, such as the method of death being an 'impact' with an energy
of 'unknown type'. From there, however, things get a bit dodgy.
Did spasms
from the sun either directly or by triggering a reaction in the planet,
cause these die offs? Are these animal deaths the result of 'warfare', here
on earth or beyond, involving energy weapons? Either or both are plausible.
Does it matter? Well, maybe not.
From the viewpoint of populace soon to be
herded by events, the 'truth' will somehow 'matter' in spite of the [daily
terrors] that will be [surfacing] to [control their thoughts (and lives)].
This year, according to how some humans interpret the
Mayan, and Aztec
calendars, is to be a year of acceleration of events as cycles within cycles
race to completion. Of course we note that so far in this manifestation of
universe, cycles just start over.
In the case of
2012 though, there is doubt. Not only by the actual language
used by the creators of
the Dresden and Madrid codices, but also within the
now huge volume of material spewing out about the subject. There is so much
coming out that the newly awakening mind, faced with the torrents of
material, is probably better off eating pie and reading the book of self
as the taoist pie bakers said waaaay back when
.
Self knowledge is the beginning of wisdom. Serious martial artists refer to
the process of self knowledge as the struggle. True victory, for those on
the path, does not come from vanquishing any number of enemies, but rather
from a single, lifelong battle with self.
To stand alone is to be uncorrupted, innocent, free of all tradition, of
dogma, of opinion, of what another says, and so on. Such a mind does not
seek because there is nothing to seek; being free, such a mind is completely
still without a want, without movement. But this state is not to be
achieved; it isnt a thing that you buy through discipline; it doesnt come
into being by giving up sex, or practicing a certain yoga.
It comes into
being only when there is an understanding of the ways of the self, the me,
which shows itself through the conscious mind in every day activity, and
also in the unconscious.
What matters is to understand for oneself, not
through the direction of others, the total content of consciousness, which
is conditioned, which is the result of society, of religion, of various
impacts, impressions, memories - to understand all that conditioning and be
free of it. But there is no how to be free.
If you ask how to be free, you
are not listening.
So says
J. Krishnamurti
a smart human.
Some time back, perhaps three years or so, while working on tuning the
lexicon, and as part of personal, linguistic background processing, and in
order to maintain currency (not the paper debt kind) with the subtle changes
in meaning of words, experiment c (the me here now), was playing a video
of a
Project Camelot (on line woo-woo guys) conference which had taken place
in South America, probably Ecuador, if memory serves.
Anyway, the conference
had gotten to a question and answer session, and a young woman stood to ask
a question (which
Bob Dean answered?) .
The question went to the
David Wilcock (a
woo-woo guy, also on line) idea of a
2012 Ascension with a big
A.
The idea that David proposes is that, (hopefully stated correctly
herein otherwise sure to be shit headed my way), some humans, by virtue of
some virtue, will, in 2012, ascend to another level of density, wherein
they will not be here on this terra, but on a terra in another state of
being, and wherein they will all have all the
siddhis (be able to create
pies out of thin air by merely thinking about them, and other trivial tricks
such as fly, bi-locate, telepathy, et al kinds of good things).
So, sitting
there, working lexical issues, coffee in hand and about to drink, when the
young woman asks the PeeCamel panel about the whole ascension issue for
2012. Both the details of the question, and the answer are entirely
irrelevant here, as the point is that the phrase she used was so perfectly
hilarious given the setting and participants and concept.
She somehow
prefaced her question with the statement that I have been doing the
work
or words to that effect
at that point, coffee began spewing out of
my nose and all over the keyboard, the rest of the conversation was lost.
What was so striking, so totally disruptive of the swallowing process that
the coffee decided it had to jump right out the snout, was the phrase doing
the work that she used. The way she used it, saying it with a bit of pride,
but also as though totally disgusted in the doing of it
annoyed, somehow,
that Ascension required effort.
It was the context expressed in the language
that begged the question as to just what the work was? Did she do extra
poses in yoga? Or more pilates? Or was she kind to homeless? Or did she tip
extra well on the way to the first class section of the plane?
Her reference to
David Wilcocks big A, ascension theory was clearly
stated as though it was a proven fact, and that she expected it to be
accepted in the setting in which she spoke as proven fact. Her language
betrayed the layers of conditioning that the big A ascension theory had
put upon her mind.
David may not have any clue that his words are used by
anothers mind to form layers of conditioning in her experience of our
common collectively manifesting reality. There is evidence that he is so
aware that comes leaking out in his choice of words in front of crowds, but
there is also no sign of any maliciousness involved.
There is no evidence
for instance that David is a control freak trying to work the religion
angle, in the dependency sense.
Unlike some personalities in the wujo, and
in the greater woo-woo world out there, who are aware that conditioning
comes from their words. Some of these beings seek to exploit the
conditioning layers that they heap out continuously. Some try to be real
pindars about being in control and telling others how to be in universe.
And
thus is revealed why
new age isn't no better than
old tyme religion
just yet
more damn conditioning between the mind and its attempt to know self. Or as
my pappy from Missouri used to say,
religion is just a man in a dress
trying to tell you that he gets a piece of your pie just because he has
voices in his head telling him that he is in charge of the slicing.
The memory of that entire video comes down to that phrase doing the work.
So much of our presence, our life directions and our karmic process leaks
out in our language. It is my experience, maturing into the wujo, that words
have power, and must be used deliberately and with care, as undoubtedly
universe will use these words to form layers of conditioning in some other
humans life. Karmic bonds come from such interweaving of life energies.
Even in noting Krishnamurtis discussion on desire, and the effects of the
klesa duality on life, it is still the desire here at hph to put out our
descriptions of leaking language lexical puzzles and to not have these
reports become part of someones conditioning, or dogma.
The idea here is to
provide a forecast of manifesting reality that can be used by the
aware
individual in their examination of self. The idea is to reject any words
herein that would be used to condition mind. In any damn direction. By any
foolish person.
And as with the young woman asking the question at the PeeCamel conference,
J. Krishnamurti said it pretty plainly
If you ask how to be free, you are not listening.
