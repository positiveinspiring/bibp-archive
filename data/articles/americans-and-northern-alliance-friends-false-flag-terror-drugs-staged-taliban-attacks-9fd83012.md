ARRESTING
"HEROIN" TO
BE IMPRISONED
IN THE BODIES OF AMERICAN
CHILDREN AND CHILDREN THE WORLD OVER
Everyone in the
world knows America's invasion of Iraq was a lie, an oil raid, from day one.
Everyone who stood against Bush and Cheney is dead, in jail or in hiding.
Similarly,
anyone who, from day one, knew 9/11 had a "smell" about it was eliminated,
down to academics, diplomats, intelligence agents, anyone who spoke up and
thousands did ON 9/11.
A STARTLING
FACT TO EVERYONE BUT THOSE RUNNING THE WAR:
Not only is
there no Al Qaeda, but what we know to be "the Taliban" is actually the
Northern Alliance.
The terror acts, persecution of women, the extremism,
is all orchestrated and staged by CIA contractors with
Blackwater and
related companies, using Northern Alliance drug lords and their gangs
pretending to be "Taliban."
This, in itself, is only one of the
Bush era
scandals. Now we have had access to an intelligence dump from Afghanistan.
The facts are startling. That war, our
"good
war," was even worse and is being continued by trickery.
We have
startling reports of human trafficking,
children being stolen around Afghanistan and sold into sexual slavery by the
tens of thousands, stories of terror bombings and assassinations meant to
prolong war, rig elections, end negotiations and compromise and control key
regions to maximize drug profits.
With full
access to "on the ground" intelligence in every province of Afghanistan,
the truth about that war will make you sick. Not one word that hits the
press is true.
We will start with the recent visit by General
Dempsey. He had just left Tel Aviv after telling Netanyahu that America
would never support an attack on Iran. NEVER.
When Dempsey landed, his plane
was rocketed and blamed on the Taliban.
Solid
intelligence cites the Northern Alliance in
cooperation with Israeli agents in Afghanistan, some of the hundreds there,
mostly with false German passports who run half the phony
United
Nations NGOs
(Non-Governmental Organizations).
They, along
with Indian intelligence, the RAW, train bomb makers, stage attacks,
supply detonators and the endless stream of Indian built weapons, run
training camps that actually do exist and have been managing a covert
war on Pakistan while the U.S. has turned a blind eye even though they are
responsible for hundreds of attacks on Americans.
Karzai - What leader can have any
credibility
who has to be protected by foreign bodyguards?
Let's
look at Karzai, a Durani tribesman,
representing, at best, 4% of the population but personally governing an area
smaller than the average American backyard.
He can't be given a large enough
security detail to freely travel in his own capitol, much less country. His rule has been maintained through a flood of
money, some billions in American aid, he pays out in bribes.
The other
money, you can guess about that.
Afghanistan produced almost NO opium when the
U.S.
invaded in late 2001. Our chosen allies were the drug lords of the Northern
Alliance, seen as criminals and foreigners by the majority of Afghans.
They have
been the worst allies imaginable and our
continued dependence on them and our appointment of Karzai, a former oil
executive, as president has made things worse.
Karzai has surrounded himself with former
Communists and Northern Alliance outcasts, they make up his government, them
and anyone willing to take money.
America's
Special Envoy, the "now dead" Richard Holbrooke is the one responsible
for certifying the narcotics production effort as central to U.S. policy.
It received key Republican support in Congress, and made war in
Afghanistan possible forever.
Why?
Richard Holbrooke
the
Diplomat Drug Lord
Colonel
Eugene Khrushchev,
former First Secretary of both the Soviet and Russian embassies in Kabul, an
editor of Veterans Today and longtime friend calls Holbrooke one of the
world's biggest "drug kingpins."
There are more American names involved including
two American senators up to their necks in the Afghan drug business, from
the "money laundering" end, making use of thousands of secret bank accounts
in the Cayman Islands, Switzerland and elsewhere. Any of this sound
familiar?
Afghanistan doesn't export opium paste anymore.
Key
Americans, many elected officials, some
military, aided by foreign intelligence services, India, Britain, Canada and
Germany have built the world's heroin processing industry there.
Shipping is handled by the Northern Alliance,
for the local market, Afghanistan is a nation of addicts now, and the
massive Russian market.
Europe is handled out of two bases,
Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo, where the U.S. flies heroin and turns
it over to the Kosovo/Albanian mafia for distribution and to Belgium, where
it is distributed for Northern Europe.
Much goes
directly to the United States via long range
drones of the private air force of CIA contracting companies, shipped as
"rendition prisoners."
Camp Bondsteel
THE REAL TALIBAN
Early in the Afghan War, 6000 POWs were taken by
American led Northern Alliance forces. All were murdered.
This is a fact,
unreported, but verifiable and indisputable. The orders came, not from some
local leader but the White House. America wanted a war "forever," not one we
could win, as we never wanted to win.
Winning a
war means
ending a war
and when a war ends,
the money stops.
About 5% of those we are fighting are
"Taliban,"
a word that means "student."
For years, the press and U.S. Army has kept the
truth from the American people.
Also
HERE...
The
Taliban has not only tried to negotiate with
the United States for year but they also have advocated that the U.S. begin a
serious opium eradication program.
They eliminated the problem before and say they
are ready to do it again, with or without us. Please remember, Taliban use
no money, have no banks, have no planes, have no stores, have nothing to
buy, own nothing, and certainly aren't part of the drug business.
The idea
that they need money is insane.
The real
Taliban stands ready to join with the governments of the U.S. and Russia
to end all drug trafficking in the region and would have done so long
ago.
As to who they are, what they believe and how
"extreme" they
actually are, every word the American people have been told is a lie.
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar
The worst
criminals in Afghanistan like
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the
"Butcher of Kabul" have secretly worked for the Americans for years though
on "terrorist lists."
Is he still living in a VIP suite on Bagram Air
Force Base as a top advisor to the U.S. command? He was last time I checked though anyone thought
to be connected to him, no matter now many "degrees of separation" has been
"drone killed," jailed or silenced.
We don't want the world to know that we
communicate with real terrorists through monsters.
We don't want anyone to
know our allies are, in fact, real terrorists and always have been.
THE PHONY TALIBAN
TERRORISM
We have learned from sources in Afghanistan that
acts of terrorism credited to the Taliban, school burnings, murders, acid
throwing, suppression of women, are not done by the Taliban at all.
We have the
names, we hold proof that Taliban "terrorism" has been systematically
staged by U.S. allies in the Northern Alliance in order to feed news
organizations around the world a continual flow of propaganda in order
to support false ideas of extremism.
The acts credited to the Taliban are done by
groups of Tajik's close to Karzai and CIA contractor units.
The real
terrorism is a result of actions by these groups, some of it actually "on
demand" by American private intelligence contractors tied to worldwide drug
distribution that need to keep the mythology going.
HAQQANI TERROR
Similarly,
much of the "Haqqani Network" said to
be under the control of Pakistan's ISI is, as with the "Taliban," staged
phony terrorism paid for by the U.S. and performed by the gangsters of the
Northern Alliance, the group the U.S. used as allies.
The whole thing is a farce, Taliban, Haqqani,
bin Laden, Al Qaeda, all just cover and deception for a long planned
geo-political, geo-gangster move toward world domination as described by the
Project for a New American Century, the author of America's downfall.
REAL STORY OF CIVIL WAR
Pashtuns
Some
say the best light infantry in the world
Most of
Afghanistan and much of Pakistan is
Pashtun.
These are the best fighters in the world as
150 years of British experience and the Russian defeat will tell you.
They exist on both sides of the border and are
ruled by two groups, one of political representatives who represent Pashtuns
in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan.
The second group are the real rulers, the
traditional tribal leaders. The U.S. has assassinated 700 Pashtun tribal
leaders, calling them "militants" or "Taliban," when, in fact, they are the
actual government of Afghanistan and always have been. This is what the "drone war" is for.
Real
government in Afghanistan, recognized even by
the U.S., is tribal "jirga's" or conferences, attended by local, regional and
national leaders. Leadership is traditional, based on tribal affiliation,
family and personal leadership characteristics.
Karzai has none of the aspects needed to lead,
he is of a minor tribe of "middlemen," the Durani, he is backed by the U.S.
and the Northern Alliance, a minority group of what were once migratory
tribesmen from the Soviet Union who became Afghanistan's real organized
crime.
They are America's best friends and Karzai's
backers, those and the people who take money and Karzai gives out billions
in U.S. taxpayer cash to his friends.
The
Pashtuns, those in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and they number in the tens
of millions, all are militarily trained, all are armed, will,
eventually, push the Northern Alliance out of Afghanistan entirely,
based on what has happened during the U.S. occupation.
That is already "written."
As Americans say in slang,
"they are toast."
We have more than substantial proof that the
enemies America claims to be fighting are created by the U.S. itself.
America attacked the majority of Afghanistan's
people, all are armed tribesmen, conveniently accused them of being "Al
Qaeda," a group that has never existed in Afghanistan, not one member of
that imaginary group has been found, not one of their bases has been located
and we have the video to prove it.
PAKISTAN'S ISI,
HAMID GUL AND THE LIARS
Hamid Gul during
his Soviet Afghan War days
There is no ISI presence in Afghanistan
despite the GOP and statements of stooges paid to say so. Pakistan's ISI,
their version of the CIA, is entirely made up of ethnic groups unacceptable
to the people of Afghanistan.
The idea that they run the Taliban is so
fanciful as to be laughable. The idea that Veterans Today editor, the 75
year old General Hamid Gul is running the war against America is equally
insane. Gul has more friends in Washington than a pharmaceutical lobbyist.
He has been long retired, takes care of his
grandchildren, is still well informed but lives a very sheltered life.
Why
the U.S. hates him is simple.
He was
the first person, head of one of the world's
major intelligence agencies, to
cite 9/11 as a
U.S. government
"false flag"
operation. He carefully explained the "why and how" using decades of
intelligence background and military expertise.
No American officer had the guts to do the same
except Army Intelligence Chief General Stubblebein and he has "slipped away"
as age, threats and abuse have had their toll.
Every story
about the ISI backing the Taliban is the creation of the Israeli/Indian
alliance. Pakistan wishes it had the influence in Afghanistan it had
back during the 80s when it worked with the Mujahedeen and CIA so
closely.
I know many of those involved, most are aged, some extremely
so.
That reminds me of the Taliban, most of them
are, of course, dead and those that now exist are a different generation and
have different beliefs.
In truth, we never knew their beliefs anyway.
They began as U.S. allies and the only reason we invaded is because they
wanted too much money for the right to build oil and gas pipelines across
Afghanistan.
This is
what we thought.
Heroin
Where the good guys became bad guys
because the endless money made them even more powerful.
Nobody imagined that America
would build 98% of the world's heroin empire there as well, an empire that
has contributed to the 15 million Americans now in prison or under some
aspect of custody.
With "privatization" of that industry, keeping
heroin flowing into America has two benefits,
-
it fills private prisons,
whose owners fund
the GOP
-
it keeps laundered corporate drug cash flowing
into the GOP as well through "Citizens United"
What has the U.S. done in Afghanistan? It is
simple.
We sent
in special operations personnel, who joined
with organized crime, a failed oil company hack, a group of burned out
former communists and set up a dictatorship while building a drug empire,
staging terror attacks to blame on the Taliban.
We allowed India and Israel to run terror
operations against our ally Pakistan and trucked thousands of tons of drugs
into Russia. In the process, we made heroin so cheap any American child can
afford addiction, one of mine did.
He is dead now.
As our
military melted down, themselves drugged with anti-psychotics, trained
to hate the local population, undisciplined, unlead, unqualified, it
began.
Americans formed gangs, murdered civilians, raped, randomly
killed local citizens in "drive by" shootings, killed any of their own
who objected and it was all covered up except for a few "Soviet Type"
show trials.
All information out of Afghanistan flows through
the hands of gangsters and drug dealers and those under their influence.
If Hitler stood on the steps of the Capitol
Building in 1945 with his boot on the neck of President Truman, we would
never have lost a war so shamefully as we have in Afghanistan.
I never
thought I could say this but Afghanistan makes Vietnam look like "the good
war."
What has been done to our troops.
The
responsibility lies here.
As for
what war has done to America, other than
filling jails with drug "victims," broken soldiers,
ruining our economy it
has also made every American fully complicit with much of our own government
in worldwide organized crime.
Afghanistan is a "milk cow," producing the
world's heroin supply, endless billions in drugs, which our "special
operations community," you know, the ones you see on TV with their night
vision and special training, the glamour boys of the military, every single
one of them knows the truth, every word I have written.
Our
information sources are throughout Pakistan
and Afghanistan, on the ground, they are direct, they are accurate and as
detailed as anyone could care for. We can cover incident by incident, tell
you who really did it, who ordered it and who paid for it.
The vast
majority of terror attacks in Afghanistan and
Pakistan are and have always been staged to justify the American presence
there, a war on America by Americans using gangsters as surrogates, working
hand in hand with corrupt spy agencies largely privatized during
the
Bush
administration.
There is so
much proof of this you could drown in it. U.S. military intelligence knows
every word and were aware this was going to be written today. There were
NO objections.
Addendum
A Note on
Training an Army
In 1968 and 1969 at the height of the Vietnam
War, the United States Marine Corps maintained two training facilities, one
at San Diego, MCRD, and one in South Carolina, Parris Island.
Each facility had one training Regiment with 48
training platoons each. There were a total of 96 platoons with 3 training
NCO's each, called "drill instructors." These units turned out the best
trained soldiers in the world.
The entire United States Marine Corps was
trained by 288 drill instructors in 8 week sessions who turned out about
8000 Marines. Three sessions, totaling 24 weeks, was adequate to supply the
entire combat contingent that successfully held the northern half of
Vietnam.
These units, which included as few as 9000
combat soldiers at one time (casualties and rotation), saw the majority of
the combat during the Vietnam War.
When they left their areas of operation
they had 100% control during the day and 65% control at night against an
enemy that could conquer Afghanistan, Pakistan and probably India as well
and have time for lunch.
During the Second World War, a similar force,
abandoned with no fire support, food and little ammunition defeated half the
military forces of Japan on the island of Guadalcanal.
In 1918, the 5th Marines, a much smaller unit, stopped the entire German army at Belleau
Wood. I belonged to both of these units. For each unit, this was their first
combat experience, all were "raw recruits."
We have been training the Army of Afghanistan
and their police force using over 12,000 trainers for 11 years and have
created a force that controls 10% of a nation when augmented with a massive
U.S. force.
On their own, they hold 0% of Afghanistan.
