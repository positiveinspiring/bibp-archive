In the wake of a public outcry against internet regulation bills such as
SOPA and PIPA, representatives of the EU have signed a new and far more
threatening legislation yesterday in Tokyo.
Spearheaded by the governments
of the United States and Japan and constructed largely in the absence of
public awareness, the measures of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)
dramatically alter current international legal framework, while introducing
the first substantial processes of global internet governance.
With complete
contempt towards the democratic process, the negotiations of the treaty were
exclusively held between industry representatives and government officials,
while excluding elected representatives and members of the press from their
hearings.
Under the guise of protecting intellectual property rights, the treaty
introduces measures that would allow the private sector to enforce sweeping
central authority over internet content.
The ACTA abolishes all legal
oversight involving the removal of content and allows copyright holders to
force
ISPs to remove material from the internet, something that presently
requires a court order.
ISPs would then be faced with legal liabilities if
they chose not to remove content. Theoretically, personal blogs can be
removed for using company logos without permission or simply linking to copy
written material; users could be criminalized, barred from accessing the
internet and even imprisoned for sharing copyrighted material.
Ultimately,
these implications would be starkly detrimental toward the internet as a
medium for free speech.
The Obama Administration subverted the legal necessity of allowing to US
Senate to ratify the treaty by unconstitutionally declaring it an executive
agreement before the President promptly signed it on October 1st, 2011.
As
a touted constitutional lawyer, Barack Obama is fully aware that
Article 1,
Section 8 of the US Constitution, mandates Congress in dealing with issues
of intellectual property, thus voiding the capacity for the President to
issue an executive agreement. The White House refused to even disclose
details about the legislation to elected officials and civil libertarians
over concern that doing so may incur "damage to the national security."
While some may hang off every word of his sorely
insincere speeches and
still be fixated by the promises of hope offered by brand-Obama, his
administration has trampled the constitution and introduced the most
comprehensive authoritarian legislation in Americas history.
In addition to imposing loosely defined criminal sanctions to average web
users, the ACTA treaty will also obligate ISPs to disclose personal user
information to copyright holders.
The measures introduce legislative
processes that contradict the legal framework of participant countries and
allows immigration authorities to search laptops, external hard drives and
Internet-capable devices at airports and border checkpoints.
The treaty is
not limited solely to internet-related matters, ACTA would prohibit the
production of generic pharmaceuticals and outlaw the use of certain seeds
for crops through patents, furthering the corporate cartelization of
the
food and
drug supply.
ACTA would allow companies from any participating country (which include EU
member states, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand,
Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Morocco) to shut down websites without any
explanation.
Hypothetically, nothing could prevent private Singaporean
companies from promptly taking down American websites that oppose the
Singapore Air Force conducting war games on US soil, such as those conducted
in December 2011.
By operating outside normal judicial framework,
exporting
US copyright law to the rest of the world and mandating private corporations
to conduct surveillance on their users, all prerequisites of democracy,
transparency and self-expression are an afterthought.
The further monopolization of the existing resources of communication,
exchange and expression is ever present in the form of deceptive new
articles of legislation that unanimously call for the implementation of the
same austere censorship measures.
Even if the ACTA treaty is not
implemented, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TTP) between,
-
Australia
-
Brunei
-
Chile
-
Malaysia
-
New Zealand
-
Peru
-
Vietnam
-
the
United States,
...offers more extensive intellectual property regulations.
Leaked documents prepared by the
U.S. Business Coalition, which have been
reportedly drafted by,
-
the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of
America
-
the US Chamber of Commerce
-
the Motion Picture Association of
America,
...report that in addition to ACTA-style legislation, the TTP will
impose fines on non-compliant entities and work to extend the general period
of copy write terms on individual products.
Under the sweeping regulations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, individual
infringers will be criminalized and sentenced with the same severity as
large-scale offenders.
Within the United States, the recently announced
Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade (OPEN) H.R. 3782
regulation seeks to install policies largely identical to SOPA and PIPA. The
Obama administration is also working towards an Internet ID program, which
may be mandatory for American citizens and required when renewing passports,
obtaining federal licenses, or applying for social security.
Spreading these
dangerous measures to other countries participating in these treaties would
necessitate a binding obligation on the US to retain these policies,
averting any chance of reform.
The ACTA will become law once it is formally ratified and cleared by the
European Parliament in June.
By petitioning members of the European
parliament and educating others about the potential dangers imposed by this
legislation, there is a chance of the treaty being rejected. Upon closer
examination of the human condition with all of its inequalities, food
insecurity and dire social issues, our governments have lost their
legitimacy for giving such unwarranted priority to fighting copyright
infringement on behalf of lobbyists from the pharmaceutical and
entertainment industries.
The existence of ACTA is a clear statement that
surveillance, regulations and securing further corporate centralization
dwarfs any constructive shift towards stimulating human innovation and
self-sufficient technologies.
When former US National Security Advisor and
Trilateral Commission
co-founder,
Zbigniew Brzezinski spoke before the
Council on Foreign
Relations in 2010, he warned of
a global political awakening beginning to
take place.
Technology such as file sharing, blogging, and open source
software has the potential to undermine the oligarchical governing interests
seeking to centrally control on our society and enforce the population into
being entirely dependent on their commodities.
The following excerpt from Brzezinskis book
Between Two Ages - America's
Role in the Technetronic Era,
provides invaluable insight into the world being brought in,
The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled
society. Such a society would be
dominated by an elite, unrestrained by
traditional values.
Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous
surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files
containing even the most personal information about the citizen.
These files
will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities.
