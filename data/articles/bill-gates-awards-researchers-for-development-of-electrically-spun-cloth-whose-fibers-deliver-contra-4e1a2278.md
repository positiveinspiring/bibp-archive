Bill Gates is at it again, throwing
money at any researcher with a claim to fame and everything to gain by using
scientific advances to prevent as many babies as possible from being born.
Soft kill drugs in the pretext of protection is the common theme for the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Cheap, effective contraceptive and HIV
pharmaceuticals are now the objectives soon to target the third world.
A University of Washington team has developed a platform they say
simultaneously offers contraception and prevents HIV.
Electrically spun cloth with nanometer-sized
fibers can dissolve to release drugs, providing a platform for cheap medical
use. The research was published this week in the Public Library of Sciences
open-access journal
PLoS One.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation last month awarded the UW
researchers almost $1 million to pursue the technology.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has
committed 10 billion dollars over the next ten years to make it the most
aggressive decade ever to roll out
new vaccines
to poor nations around the
world.
The commitment
will also effectively create widespread fertility
problems across vaccinated populations.
Bill Gates told a recent TED conference, an organization which is sponsored
by one of the largest toxic waste polluters on the planet, that vaccines
need to be used to reduce world population figures in order to solve global
warming and lower CO2 emissions.
"We have the drugs to do that. Its really
about delivering them in a way that makes them more potent, and allows a
woman to want to use it, said author Kim Woodrow, a UW assistant
professor of bioengineering.
Electrospinning uses an electric
field to catapult a charged fluid jet through air to create very fine,
nanometer-scale fibers.
The fibers can be manipulated to control the
materials solubility, strength and even geometry. Fibers may be even better
at delivering medicine than existing technologies such as gels, tablets or
pills.
Nano-microchips invisible to the naked eye are a reality that are
already being hosted in wide-range of applications.
No high temperatures are involved, so the method is suitable for
heat-sensitive molecules. The fabric can also incorporate large molecules,
such as proteins and antibodies, that are hard to deliver through other
methods.
The final material is a stretchy fabric.
This method allows controlled release of
multiple compounds, said coauthor Cameron Ball. We were able to tune
the fibers to have different release properties.
One of the fabrics they made dissolves within
minutes, potentially offering users immediate, discrete protection against
unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
Another dissolves gradually over a few days,
providing an option for sustained delivery, more like the birth-control
pill, to provide contraception and guard against HIV.
The fabric could incorporate many fibers to
include more than one anti-HIV drug. Mixed fibers could be designed to
release drugs at different times to increase their potency, like the
prime-boost method used in vaccines.
The electrospun cloth could be inserted directly
in the body or be used as a coating on vaginal rings or other products.
This is the first study to use nanofibers for vaginal drug delivery. Critics
claim that no long-term studies have been established to assess safety which
could pose serious health implications to third world countries where the
cloths are targeted for use.
Further research is needed into the risks associated with the growing field
of nanotechnology manufacture. A vast and rapidly expanding array of
engineered nano-products are
flooding the consumer market unregulated as evidence of toxicities
accumulate.
The team is focusing on places like Africa, but
the technology could be used in the U.S. or other countries to offer birth
control.
The team will use the new Gates Foundation grant
to evaluate the versatility and feasibility of their system. The group will
hire more research staff and buy an electrospinning machine to make
butcher-paper sized sheets.
The expanded team will then spend a year testing
combinations that deliver two antiretroviral drugs and a hormonal
contraceptive, and then six months scaling up production of the most
promising materials.
No long-term studies have been planned before officially releasing the new
drug technology to the public.
The public will be the long-term study...
