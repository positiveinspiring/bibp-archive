It is now admitted by the
New York Times that the entire armed so-called
"opposition" is comprised entirely of Al Qaeda, meaning
the torrent of cash and weapons sent to the "opposition"
by the West and its regional allies, were intentionally
sent directly to listed terrorists guilty of a multitude
of unprecedented atrocities.
"Nowhere in Rebel-Controlled
Syria
is There a Secular Fighting Force to
Speak Of"
NYT
In an astounding admission, the New York Times
confirms that the so-called "Syrian opposition" is entirely run by Al Qaeda
and literally states:
Nowhere in rebel-controlled Syria is there
a secular fighting force to speak of.
From the beginning, it was clear to geopolitical
analysts that the conflict in Syria was not "pro-democracy" protesters
rising up, but rather the fruition of a well-documented conspiracy between
the US, Israel, and Saudi Arabia to arm and direct sectarian extremists
affiliated with Al Qaeda against the Syrian government.
This was documented as early as 2007 - a full 4 years before the 2011 "Arab
Spring" would begin - by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh in
his New Yorker article titled, "The
Redirection - Is the Administrations new policy benefiting our enemies in
the war on terrorism?" which stated specifically:
To undermine Iran, which is predominantly
Shiite, the Bush Administration has decided, in effect, to reconfigure
its priorities in the Middle East.
In Lebanon, the Administration has coöperated with Saudi Arabias government, which is Sunni, in
clandestine operations that are intended to weaken Hezbollah, the Shiite
organization that is backed by Iran.
The U.S. has also taken part in
clandestine operations aimed at Iran and its ally Syria. A by-product of
these activities has been the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that
espouse a militant vision of Islam and are hostile to America and
sympathetic to Al Qaeda.
For the past two years,
-
the US
-
UK
-
France
-
Saudi
Arabia
-
Qatar
-
Jordan
-
Turkey,
...have sent billions of dollars and
thousands of tons of weapons into Syria
along side known-terrorists from,
-
Libya
-
Chechnya
-
Lebanon
-
Jordan
-
Iraq
In the Telegraph's article titled, "US
and Europe in 'major airlift of arms to Syrian rebels through Zagreb',"
it is reported:
It claimed 3,000 tons of weapons dating
back to the former Yugoslavia have been sent in 75 planeloads from
Zagreb airport to the rebels, largely via Jordan since November
The story confirmed the origins of
ex-Yugoslav weapons seen in growing numbers in rebel hands in online
videos, as described last month by The Daily Telegraph and other
newspapers, but suggests far bigger quantities than previously
suspected.
The shipments were allegedly paid for by
Saudi Arabia at the bidding of the United States, with assistance on
supplying the weapons organized through Turkey and Jordan, Syria's
neighbors.
But the report added that as well as from Croatia,
weapons came "from several other European countries including
Britain", without specifying if they were British-supplied or
British-procured arms.
British military advisers however are
known to be operating in countries bordering Syria alongside French
and Americans, offering training to rebel leaders and former Syrian
army officers.
The Americans are also believed to be providing
training on securing chemical weapons sites inside Syria.
Additionally, The New York Times in its article,
"Arms
Airlift to Syria Rebels Expands, With C.I.A. Aid," admits that:
With help from the C.I.A., Arab governments
and Turkey have sharply increased their military aid to Syrias
opposition fighters in recent months, expanding a secret airlift of arms
and equipment for the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad,
according to air traffic data, interviews with officials in several
countries and the accounts of rebel commanders.
The airlift, which began on a small scale in early 2012 and continued
intermittently through last fall, expanded into a steady and much
heavier flow late last year, the data shows.
It has grown to include
more than 160 military cargo flights by Jordanian, Saudi and Qatari
military-style cargo planes landing at Esenboga Airport near Ankara,
and, to a lesser degree, at other Turkish and Jordanian airports.
And more recently the US State Department had
announced hundreds of millions of dollars more in aid, equipment and even
armored vehicles to militants operating in Syria, along with demands of its
allies to "match" the funding to reach a goal of over a billion dollars.
The
NYT would report in their article, "Kerry
Says U.S. Will Double Aid to Rebels in Syria," that:
With the pledge of fresh aid, the total
amount of nonlethal assistance from the United States to the coalition
and civic groups inside the country is $250 million. During the meeting
here, Mr. Kerry urged other nations to step up their assistance, with
the objective of providing $1 billion in international aid.
And as this astronomical torrent of cash,
weapons, and equipment was overtly sent by the West into Syria, the US State
Department since the very beginning of the violence has known that the most
prominent fighting group operating inside Syria was Al Qaeda, more
specifically, the al Nusra front.
The US State Department's official press
statement titled, "Terrorist
Designations of the al-Nusrah Front as an Alias for al-Qa'ida in Iraq,"
stated explicitly that:
Since November 2011, al-Nusrah Front has
claimed nearly 600 attacks - ranging from more than 40 suicide attacks
to small arms and improvised explosive device operations - in major city
centers including Damascus, Aleppo, Hamah, Dara, Homs, Idlib, and Dayr
al-Zawr. During these attacks numerous innocent Syrians have been
killed.
The State Department admits that from the very
beginning, Al Qaeda has been carrying out hundreds of attacks in every major
city in Syria.
Clearly for those who read
the 2007 Hersh piece in the New Yorker, and then witnessed the rise of
Al Qaeda in Syria, the explanation is quite simple - the West intentionally
and systematically funded and armed Al Qaeda to gain a foothold in Syria,
then overthrow the Syrian government in an unprecedented sectarian bloodbath
and subsequent humanitarian catastrophe, just as was planned years ago.
However, now, according to Western leaders, the public is expected to
believe that despite the US, UK, France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, and
Turkey flooding Syria with billion in cash, and thousands of tons of
weapons, all sent exclusively to "secular moderates," somehow, Al Qaeda has
still managed to gain preeminence amongst the "opposition."
How can this be? If a 7-nation axis is arraying the summation of its
resources in the region behind "secular moderates," who then is arraying
even more resources behind Al Qaeda?
The answer is simple. There never were
any "secular moderates," a fact the New York Times has now fully admitted.
In its article titled, "Islamist
Rebels Create Dilemma on Syria Policy," the New York Times admits:
Across Syria, rebel-held areas are
dotted with Islamic courts staffed by lawyers and clerics, and by
fighting brigades led by extremists.
Even the Supreme Military
Council, the umbrella rebel organization whose formation the West
had hoped would sideline radical groups, is stocked with commanders
who want to infuse Islamic law into a future Syrian government.
Nowhere in rebel-controlled Syria is
there a secular fighting force to speak of.
However, in an explanation that defies reason,
the article states:
The Islamist character of the opposition
reflects the main constituency of the rebellion, which has been led
since its start by Syrias Sunni Muslim majority, mostly in
conservative, marginalized areas.
The descent into brutal civil war has
hardened sectarian differences, and the failure of more mainstream rebel
groups to secure regular arms supplies has allowed Islamists to fill the
void and win supporters.
To "secure regular arms supplies" from whom?
According to the West, they have been supplying "mainstream rebel groups"
with billions in cash, and thousands of tons of weaponry - and now
according to
the BBC, training as well.
Where if not intentionally and directly into
the hands of al-Nusra, did all of this cash, these weapons, and training go?
The NYT also admits:
Of most concern to the United States
is the Nusra Front, whose leader recently confirmed that the group
cooperated with Al Qaeda in Iraq and pledged fealty to Al Qaedas top
leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, Osama bin Ladens longtime deputy.
Nusra has claimed responsibility for a number of suicide
bombings and is the group of choice for the foreign jihadis pouring into
Syria.
Not only is the Syrian government fighting now
openly admitted Al Qaeda terrorists, but terrorists that are not even of
Syrian origin.
More outrageous still, is that the New York Times fully admits that the very
oil fields the European Union has lifted sanctions on and is now buying oil
from in Syria (see BBC's "EU
eases Syria oil embargo to help opposition"), are completely controlled
by Al Qaeda - meaning the European Union is now intentionally exchanging
cash with known international terrorists guilty of horrific atrocities, in
exchange for oil.
The NYT reports:
Elsewhere, they [al-Nusra] have seized
government oil fields, put employees back to work and now profit from
the crude they produce.
And:
In the oil-rich provinces of Deir al-Zour
and Hasaka, Nusra fighters have seized government oil fields, putting
some under the control of tribal militias and running others themselves.
The Times continues by admitting:
Nusras hand is felt most
strongly in Aleppo, where the group has
set up camp in a former childrens hospital and has worked with
other rebel groups to establish a Shariah Commission in the eye
hospital next door to govern the citys rebel-held neighborhoods.
The commission runs a police force and an Islamic court that hands
down sentences that have included lashings, though not amputations
or executions as some Shariah courts in other countries have done.
Nusra fighters also control the power
plant and distribute flour to keep the citys bakeries running.
This last point, "and distribute flour to keep
the city's bakeries running," is of extreme importance, because that "flour"
they are "distributing" comes admittedly, directly from the United State of
America.
In the Washington Post's article, "U.S.
feeds Syrians, but secretly," it is claimed that:
In the heart of rebel-held territory in
Syrias northern province of Aleppo, a small group of intrepid
Westerners is undertaking a mission of great stealth.
Living anonymously
in a small rural community, they travel daily in unmarked cars, braving
airstrikes, shelling and the threat of kidnapping to deliver food and
other aid to needy Syrians - all of it paid for by the U.S. government.
The Washington Post then claims that most
Syrians credit Al Qaeda's al-Nusra with providing the aid:
America has done nothing for us. Nothing at
all, said Mohammed Fouad Waisi, 50, spitting out the words for emphasis
in his small Aleppo grocery store, which adjoins a bakery where he buys
bread every day.
The bakery is fully supplied with flour paid for by the
United States.
But Waisi credited Jabhat al-Nusra - a rebel group the
United States has designated a terrorist organization because of its
ties to al-Qaeda - with providing flour to the region, though he
admitted he wasnt sure where it comes from.
Clearly, the puzzle is now complete.
Indeed Mr.
Mohammed Fouad Waisi was correct, Jabhat al-Nusra, a listed terrorist
organization by the US State Department, is supplying the people with flour,
flour it receives by the ton directly and intentionally from the United
States in direct contradiction to its own anti-terror laws, international
laws, and the US State Department's own frequent denials that it is
bolstering terrorists inside of Syria.
Clearly the US and its allies are propping up terrorism, and more alarming
is that the "aid" they have been providing the Syrian people, appears to
have been used as a political weapon by Al Qaeda, allowing them to take,
hold, and permanently subjugate territory inside Syria.
It should be noted
again, that the New York Times itself admits that the ranks of al-Nusra are
filled with foreign, not Syrian, fighters.
Revealed is a conspiracy so insidious, so outrageous, and a web of lies so
tangled, that Western governments perhaps count on their populations to
disbelieve their tax money is being used to intentionally fund and arm
savage terrorism while purposefully fueling a sectarian bloodbath whose
death toll is sounded daily by the very people driving it up to astronomical
heights.
The cards are down - the US has been exposed as openly funding,
arming, and supplying Al Qaeda in Syria for two years and in turn, is
directly responsible for the death, atrocities, and humanitarian disasters
within and along Syria's borders that have resulted.
While the US attempts to sell military intervention on behalf of Al Qaeda in
Syria,
using the flimsy, yet familiar pretext of "chemical weapons," it appears
that before even one American boot officially touches Syrian soil, an
already horrific crime against humanity of historic proportions has been
committed by the US and its allies against the Syrian people.
