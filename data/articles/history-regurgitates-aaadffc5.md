Those who cannot remember The Past
are Condemned to Repeat It.
George Santayana
Charles Dickens begins his book 'A Tale of Two Cities' with the line,
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
I doubt Dickens time could have look better or worse than our times now: let me explain. We are witnessing a violent regurgitation of history never learned. It's happening again, according to script in the same way as the last times - even discussing it seems cartoonish. When will mankind ever learn? Perhaps this is our last chance, our Hail Mary moment, because the enemy does learn and is about to lock the entire world in a grotesque, dystopian tyranny, using the same deceptions, recreated drama, clownish tricks, tactics and false flag fear used each time in the past.
Only this time, it would seem the enemy has learned how to make it last. Its astounding the new(old) world tyranny would attempt, again, to use the same psychological deceptions and just plain tiring bromides to deceive Americans and the Western world into disarming and capitulating to iron-fisted tyranny.
A tyranny busy in plain sight building a prison planet, a permanent residence for humanity - with no doors and no windows, only darkness.
From the Cradle to the Grave
For at least the past 600 years (and no doubt longer) the financially super wealthy and so-called elite families (hereditarily psychopaths) have been busy planning to capture the entire planet in a web of tyranny which, for the first time in our recorded history, could put the entire planet in the hands of those who believe they would be kings. The strategy has included a patient, slow planning and testing period using country after country as a laboratory for improving both technological and psychological tools for use in the final enslavement of the planetary population.
The United States of America was chosen as the vehicle for the final 200+ years of wealth generation and technological improvements to fund and develop the entire package necessary for world domination.
Along the way many ancient secrets and previously failed ideas were tried again with improvements added to increase efficacy.
So, rather than using physical methods to subdue large populations, chemical, biological, psychological, electrical and nanotechnologies are being implemented to create the perfect environment for total capture. An important and necessary component of the total domination is the practical requirement that mankind assist in their enslavement.
Over the years many failed philosophies and social ideologies have been marketed to humans as a way to enlist support of the psychopaths' plan. Collectivism has been one of the most successful ways to recruit weak, unprotected, minds into cooperating with their own enslavement. Collectivist-based governments and social systems result in outstandingly miserable conditions and crippling losses of liberty; but, interestingly, when packaged and marketed properly, a majority of people will adopt and aggressively support the ideas. Human psychological frailties help maintain support for Collectivism, even when it becomes apparent it is a prison, a trap wherein victims have been collected as slaves. Since collectivism has repeatedly been tried by tyrants attempting to control entire countries, there has been much written and many warnings previously issued exposing these ideas.
Modern psychopaths have used education systems, food and water contaminants, and the proclivity for humans to become docile when constantly entertained, as a way to prevent this highly documented knowledge from passing generation to generation. Those of us awake have to watch in continuing horror as Obama, intellectual heir of Marxist Frank Marshal Davis, and confidant of terrorist and communist activist Bill Ayers, makes speeches to college students and political rallies spewing the same second-hand communist propaganda spoken in former soviet Russia, communist China, communist Cuba and elsewhere.
The rhetoric is entraining, delivered with the confidence of a trained actor, but the message is the same:
We are the government and we will take care of all of your needs from the cradle to the grave.
A key word in this tired, communist, repetitive, repudiated, drone-on, is the grave; the grave will be the first stop for most of those standing and loudly supporting this fabricated deception. The idea of the technocrats, bureaucrats, and our benevolent betters, controlling society is not a new thing.
The Just City or Utopia or the workers' paradise or any other outright inversions of reality repeated and promulgated by serial liars, disguised as do-gooders, has been a plague on humankind since the time of Babylon.
Plato in his famous bit of predictive prose The Republic envisioned a Just City, run by guardians, chosen at childhood and raised by the state to be the perfect caretakers of the lower classes.
Just City was based on a communist model of shared property, including women, children raised by the State, and regimented societies managed by layers of bureaucracy.
Children of inferior parentage would be left to die (sacrificed for the State.)
Not surprisingly - Platos Just City is just the city psychopathic power tyrants would love to infest, and eventually occupy and rule. (see Pathocracy - Tyranny at the hands of Psychopaths.) After Just City, variations of Platos enlightened and intellectually pleasing, but reality-challenged ideas, came along, such as Thomas Mores Utopia, loosely resembling Platos idea, with communal property and legislated morality - basically a community, which at least aesthetically, is reminiscent of the communities in the movie The Hunger Games.
Each of the 54 communities in the Utopian, Utopia, were broken down into groups of 30 communes controlled by a bureaucracy; a hierarchy of "managers" with absolute power over the commune. Utopian schemes and sugar-coated derivatives typically feature control over sex, religion, choice of occupation, child raising, choices regarding what to think and believe, etc.
Utopian ideas have been refined with years and years of intellectual improvements leading to modern police states, properly called technocracies, with technology aiding the controllers in relentless refinements in the control of humans.
The primary ideas of police-state control zones based on "Utopian" delusions involve a total loss of individuality in subservience to a State or control paradigm. Utopias, ancient or modern, value uniformity over individuality with penalties for expressions of individuality. Plato and More and many other contributors to ideas resulting in modern authoritarian police states (such as Rousseau, Marx etc.) are expressing symptoms of their own psychological pathology.
How would it be consistent with mans continued survival and ascendancy toward higher expressions of consciousness if the nature of living were to support a static uniformity while functioning as a component in a mechanized equivalent of a human bee hive?
See the YouTube video in the references for a modern approach to an old Utopian idea:
The crime of the intellectual establishment, generally funded by wealthy psychopathic elite, is ignoring the mental health of those espousing systems of human civilization which clearly have no benefit to the individual, or worse, these systems, in the long run, result in the destruction of the individual.
It must be obvious being born an individual, as are all other men, implies a maximally individual experience is the natural goal and highest value of being alive.
Pathologies ranging from denial, reaction formation and victim identity cycle operating in the personality types of psychopaths can lead to projections of human personality disorders on physical systems in real life.
Hitler Lenin Trotsky Stalin Mao Pol Pot,
Hitler
Lenin
Trotsky
Stalin
Mao
Pol Pot,
...and so many others, are examples of psychological pathologies preying on the "intellectual" sanctification of neurotic Utopian ideas.
Mentally ill minds projecting a distorted reality into real-world constructions ultimately result in classic tyranny and suffering by those affected. Organizations can evolve from malignant ideas, resulting in dangerous life extinguishing paradigms enveloping whole societies as cults of death and misappropriating the human experience. The wealthy psychopathic elite use large monetary endowments and trusts to create, fund, direct and manipulate organizations based on mentally ill and malignant ideas. As the ideas of Plato and More have been tried and failed, with each failure they have been refined and repackaged into something sounding even better than previous renditions.
Words like Marxism (19th century) and Communism or workers' paradise (20th century renditions), have been upgraded to sustainable and environmentally responsible societies, promising happiness through serving others, living more austere and protecting the planet while serving a collective goal and authority.
This claptrap has been created to appeal to "smart," socially responsible and trendy intellectual types that have already been programmed to find these kind of ideas attractive. Publicly educated, modern "intellectuals" having been granted "degrees," representing knowledge, fully understand why it is important to support a belief their education and degrees are actually based on truth and real knowledge - they are not.
The degrees are more akin to degrees of freemasonry or other occult, reality isolated, paradigms. The education is a narrative supporting the paradigm, called knowledge, since it represents knowledge of the paradigm. So-called Liberals were yesterdays communists and a former generations Utopians. Controlled education systems (think Rockefeller, Carnegie, Ford foundations) ensure history is replaced with fiction, and thinking is reserved only for most deserving elite. This plan guarantees well-educated (indoctrinated), taxpayer (slave) common folk can never know when these hereditary thieves regurgitate the same wholly repudiated body of fabricated "knowledge" and hurl it on the minds of the naive, once again achieving the predicted results.

How humiliating it is, that the majority of Americans have bought and paid for the same package of tyranny responsible for the American Revolution some 237 years ago.
The same re-packaged garbage resulting in the murder of tens of millions of Russians while the psychopaths at the top promised a workers' paradise.
The workers got paradise - they were quickly dispatched to kingdom come, while the grand architects of that workers' paradise reveled in what I call a psychopath's moment of ecstasy: the precise moment at which the bubble of deceit finds it largest diameter and explodes, exposing the victim to a tumultuous emotional mountain of pain.
When I look for these people, I look for someone to exploit, someone to expose all their weaknesses to themselves and leave them broken, hating themselves more than most of them already do. I enjoy causing people to realize the nasty truths of themselves (which is usually that they are pathetic lying individuals) even if I have to be hypocritical and lie myself in order to get my point across. -- a female psychopath

The psychopaths moment of ecstasy happens as the deceiver is revealed to the deceived, with further criteria: the deceived is powerless to take any action. To explain by example, and belabor the point, the psychopaths moment of ecstasy is the moment when people discover the PATRIOT Act is not patriotic at all, but really the exact opposite, but, it is too late.
Homeland Security is already at the door with goons and guns. Its the moment food lovers learn the FDA is not about food safety, but rather about carefully concealing food poisons - oh but its too late, you just started chemotherapy.
Its when you learn the government is not stockpiling weapons to fight terrorists - but rather they are the terrorists and the bullets are for Constitution-supporting real patriots.
It's when it you fully understand that Obama Care is the end of health care, but its too late for you, because the death panel has just decided you are too old for a liver transplant. The empathically devoid psychopath is not lovable, but he can be called a tireless worker - working for a crescendo moment such as when its learned "sensible and reasonable" gun control really means a sensible and reasonable way to disarm a population before using guns against them. The same psychopaths writhe in ecstasy as Americans, when hearing North Korea announce the intention to launch nuclear weapons on America, are paralyzed in fear. Fear the psychopaths know will obscure the facts: North Korea is the least likely nation on Earth to be able to build nuclear weapons.
North Korea is a fully devolved communist disaster; hungry, brain drained, ruled by a child video gamer - a nation destroyed from within by the same scourge once responsible for leaving the Soviets unable to produce even a working pair of gloves after their glorious Red Revolution. Sure the NK have developed nukes, and they have anti-gravity flying machines, too.
The point being, if the North Koreans have a working, deployable nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States, then it must be true the Western World, namely the United States, and the Western intelligence agencies, gave it to them to menace and terrorize, on cue, those very same Western countries.
North Korea is nation-state incarnation of Orwells Emmanuel Goldstein - ready to attack and never stoppable. America, the wealthiest nation on Earth and by far the most industrious of any in the past thousand years, should have been able to protect the minds of their children from careful and relentless manipulations of power-lusting psychopaths, which axiomatically are always awaiting the opportunity to create a crisis and take control.
However, it is also true that advanced technology, both physical and psychological, has been developed using confiscated American money, through taxes and direct theft, and deployed in many paradigms to block and interfere with truth and dissemination of information. Advances in mind control technology, developed in secrecy over the previous 100 years have resulted in sophisticated and subtle thought manipulation, with many channels to the mind, including electromagnetic (non visual), visual, language, chemical and other more exotic technologies, creating a false reality pulled over our heads.

The history of the psychopath is the history of humanity, intertwined and revolving in a perpetual yin and yang.
Like a double-stranded DNA spiral, the psychopaths rise and fall corresponds to humanity's rise and fall. It is only at troughs, or after a civilization collapses, when people become aware of the psychopath's affect; but the knowledge is ephemeral, like memory of birth pains in a female, it fades away.
Perhaps there is a deliberate, built-in biological blind spot, something genetically engineered into humans forcing an endless building and destruction and rebuilding again.
Perhaps we are just amusements in the hands of an angry god, doomed to repetitive replay and violent regurgitation of the same story, over and over again.
Can it be so hard to remember that man is either self-responsible or the ward of another? Can it be so hard to retain and pass on the knowledge man must be able to protect himself in order to survive and reproduce, and therefore cannot be deprived of weapons for self-defense? Is it so hard to pass on to the next generation the Wisdom of Insecurity? Is the transference of self-responsibility to nameless collectors a fatal flaw in the expression of Earths humanity?

At this moment we are about to experience a historic psychopath's moment of ecstasy.
As far as I know, this has happened on this planet over and over since time immemorial, with remains of advanced-civilizations-fallen littered around the globe as our possible proof. The psychopath's moment of ecstasy is a period when the majority of the people on the planet are exposed to a hyperbolic explosion of a bubble of deceit - when reality comes rushing in as the oxygen of delusion is all consumed.
Its at this time humanity faces its greatest danger and simultaneously its greatest opportunity to grow and earn a rite of passage.
It is the worst of times and it is the best of times.

Part Two - Paradigms Lost
Paradigms of the past are cracking; the gigantic sound of twisted metal and concrete creaking and falling to the ground can be heard by anyone awake and aware.
Most sense something - but what? Most have a viewpoint based on a view of life - likely a view derived from the prison of paradigms now lost. The awakening is approaching and paradigms of deception are coming down all around. It is complicated, in my mind, to explain the race underway - the race between hard-working psychopaths, intelligent indeed; planners and patient no doubt; and the lazy, life-go-lucky, "normal-paths" (my made-up word) who are starting to see the writing on the wall.
This is an important race, not just for the sheep on their way to slaughter, but for the wolves, carefully and jealously incubating and nurturing this long-term plan now about to un-cloak. The psychopaths have arranged for a defining moment of ecstasy - an extended ecstasy, because the diameter of the bubble of deception is larger than at any time in recorded history. But not only does the psychopath have his moment, normal-paths, too, will experience an emotional thunder as paradigms once thought immutable vanish as vapor.
The depth of the psychopath's experience is dependent on the emotional expression of the normal-path; an experience maximized as the distance between reality and delusion most are suffering is maximized.

The paradigms of our false reality are all lies. Paradigms created over thousands of years for occulted purposes of collecting and harvesting human energies are now being exposed and the result will challenge humanity's ability to cope, assimilate and recover.
Some, but by no means all, of the paradigms up for exposure include:
[ Paradigm = Reality ] Government = Enslavement for profit and lust of control, psychopaths' pretended necessity to keep man safe. Primary uses include creating constant turmoil, confusion, periodic war and wealth transference. Organized Religion = Mind control, suppressing spiritual knowledge, suppressing humanity's history, suppressing technology and historical science. Polarizing diverse cultures against each other. Creating diversity that can be exploited for maximum division of groups. Medicine = Long-term illness for profit, suppressing natural cures providing for manufactured symptom management. Education = Disinformation, confusion, support of false paradigms. Suppression and control of powerful knowledge including energy systems and the history of humanity. Science = Limit human knowledge, preventing full understanding of reality, supporting profitable false paradigms of limited energy. The Nature of Reality = Suppressing spiritual knowledge, suppressing humanity's history, suppressing the knowledge that man does not require authorities to live free and happy, suppressing knowledge that energy is free and all around. Suppressing knowledge about our neighbors in the universe. Trust = Deceit. The psychopaths are masters of the authority figure, the icon producers, exchanging trust for pseudo-intellectual symbols of trust - wooden nickels and tungsten-filled gold, a stethoscope and lab jacket. Security = A prison. Security provided by the psychopaths is false. It is the deliberate destruction of all security in trade for liberties and payable in horror and fear. Banking and Finance = Complete fraud, millenniums-old scam purposely skimming wealth in small degrees over short periods of time while siphoning all wealth over long periods. A system of enslavement requiring the complete surrender of economic power or wealth to the banking conglomerate. It is a special Alchemy of turning the psychopaths empty desire into gold (humanity's gold.)

These are a few paradigms soon to be lost as will soon be evident.
For non-psychopaths, waking up will be groggy as the drug of complacency starts to wear off. Meanwhile, as if the hangover and withdrawal symptoms are not enough, the psychopaths are already closing the prison doors - hurrying to complete the plan before humanity shakes off its spell. Is there time to stop this ticking bomb ? No, but there is time to change the ending and use this opportunity to tear down all the old paradigms and begin again. Because the greatest fear of the psychopaths is: Humanity will use their work and years of preparation against them - right at the moment when the trap is sprung. I think the universe, or God or whomever each of us believes has our best interest in mind, has created an opening, a last-minute possible escape, but it is only available if enough of us wake up, shake it off, see it for what it is, and then use it for everyones benefit; turning it back on our oppressors and taking back our birth right to life. The paradigms lost were actually paradigms of enslavement and must be lost if humanity is to grow, once and forever, past this game of dominator and dominated and ascend into a world of intellectual, spiritual and individual enlightenment.
If we are to grow beyond the fear of insecurity, while learning to not need false comfort from controllers, and then renounce the need for some authority to offer the way, humanity will finally be able to leave the nest and self-actualize into its destiny. Now,
as the psychopaths bring down the paradigms looking for fear and resignation, preying on emotional collapse as financial systems are destroyed and our perceived means of protections fall away as claims to property and other rights are repudiated and religions fail to rapture as the psychopaths pretend unimaginable emergencies and bring false flag destruction and murder,
as the psychopaths bring down the paradigms looking for fear and resignation, preying on emotional collapse
as financial systems are destroyed and our perceived means of protections fall away
as claims to property and other rights are repudiated and religions fail to rapture
as the psychopaths pretend unimaginable emergencies and bring false flag destruction and murder,
...now is the time to let go of the paradigms lost.
Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth. Buddha
Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth.
Buddha
It is at this juncture between an end of one package of paradigms and a new paradigm, when mankind can release the chains, lose the paradigms of enslavement and regain responsibility for our own lives.
As the fog of deception and the depravity of enslavement give way to reason and truth, it will become clear nothing has actually been taken away; our resources are still here and intact, and no contracts signed tacitly or under duress are valid - our souls will be free and the veil of a false reality will fall, revealing a world of infinite possibilities. For the first time in recorded history, the races of humanity can lose the paradigms of racial division, exacerbated for purposes of division by the psychopaths, and join together to fight a common enemy. The comments of Ronald Reagan regarding mankinds need to come together in the event of an alien invasion, is actually a bit of predictive programming and can be used to overcome racial differences by recognizing we all have a common enemy now and we must come together. The paradigms are lost and we can shout hallelujah and thank the psychopaths for bringing our souls to cleansing, for unlocking our sleeping minds to knowledge and spiritual enlightenment and the realization enough is really enough. The co-evolution of humanity with the psychopath can now end, and those that served the purposes of evil personified are finished and mankind can be freed from this parasite; the yin and yang of construction to destruction, over and over, completed and its purpose fulfilled.
Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away. Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities

If only we open our eyes and see the opportunity.
It is here right now and it will seem like a long time as the opening appears before closing - but the door to enlightenment will close soon enough again, and without courage and fortitude and willingness to push the boundaries of our paradigms now lost, it will close without us, perhaps forever. Here are a few things that might help pry open the doors of our perception so we can break on through through to the other side. Axiom:
Psychopaths exist and are actively seeking to control and enslave your life.
Corollaries:
Institutions based on trust alone will never be trustworthy. Liberty traded for security will result in neither. A childs best and first champions are his and her parents. Only coercion-free competition can regulate a market. There is no such thing as the public interest. There is no public interest in national interests. There are only individual interests. Organized religion was organized for mind control. Mandatory education systems funded by coerced payments will teach support of the system. Mandatory health care will eventually kill you. All men and women should be armed. Cartels benefit only those in the cartel. Patents and copyrights can be no longer than a generation (i.e. less than 20 years). Words have definitions and will be used to deceive. Knowledge is power and knowledge will be hoarded. Individuals must continuously self-educate. Democracy is a tool of the psychopath. Truth must be the highest virtue. If groups must operate in secrecy they have something to hide. Property taxes mean you do not own your property. Income taxes are slavery. Contract, maritime, and private law are legal fictions used to deceive. Psychopaths will always work to eliminate competition. Prohibitions will be used as protection for systems above the law. The prohibitors will become the pusher. Legislating morality will increase corruption and immoral behavior.
