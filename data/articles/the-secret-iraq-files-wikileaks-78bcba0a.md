In the biggest leak of
military secrets in history, WikiLeaks, the whistleblower website, has
released 400,000 secret US files detailing every aspect of the war in Iraq,
copies of which have been obtained by Al Jazeera.
The sheer magnitude of data contained in the secret files reveals a graphic
narrative of the war that goes far beyond any information about the conflict
ever released into the public domain.
Using thousands of classified US military reports, Al Jazeera is now able to
tell the inside story of a war which left thousands dead and a country
fractured along sectarian lines.
Working with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism in London for the past
10 weeks, Al Jazeera has analyzed tens of thousands of documents, finding
facts the US has kept hidden from public scrutiny.
What has been uncovered often contradicts the official narrative of the
conflict. For example, the leaked data shows that the US has been keeping
records of Iraqi deaths and injuries throughout the war, despite public
statements to the contrary.
The latest cache of files pertains to a period of six years - from January
1, 2004, to December 31, 2009 - and shows that 109,000 people died during
this time. Of those, a staggering 66,081 - two-thirds of the total - were
civilians.

In the biggest official files leak in history nearly 400,000 Iraq war logs
reveal the massive scale of civilian deaths and new torture allegations
following an investigation by Channel 4′s Dispatches.
Channel 4 News has accessed the data in the classified documents via The
Bureau of Investigative Journalism and WikiLeaks.
The only TV doc to have advance access to the biggest WikiLeaks release
ever. This is what really happened during the Iraq war, not what the US PR
machine of the time wanted us to believe. The reality behind the civilian
death count; al-Qaedas fictitious presence; torture, torture and more
torture.
A wall of truth revealing unprecedented levels of unwarranted
aggression.
Dispatches, Channel 4′s flagship current affairs strand, exposes the full
and unreported horror of the Iraqi conflict and its aftermath, revealing the
true scale of civilian casualties and allegations that even after the
scandal of Abu Ghraib, American soldiers continued to abuse prisoners.
And that US forces did not systematically intervene in the torture and
murder of detainees by the Iraqi security services.
The program also
features previously unreported material of insurgents being killed while
trying to surrender.
