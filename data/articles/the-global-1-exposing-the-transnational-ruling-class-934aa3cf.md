The Occupy Movement has developed a mantra
that addresses the great inequality of wealth and power between the worlds
wealthiest 1 percent and the rest of us, the other 99 percent.
While the 99 percent mantra undoubtedly serves
as a motivational tool for open involvement, there is little understanding
as to who comprises the 1 percent and how they maintain power in the world.
Though a good deal of academic research has dealt with the power elite in
the United States, only in the past decade and half has research on the
transnational corporate class begun to emerge.1
Foremost among the early works on the idea of an
interconnected 1 percent within global capitalism was Leslie Sklairs
2001 book, The Transnational Capitalist Class.2
Sklair believed that globalization was moving
transnational corporations (TNC) into broader international roles, whereby
corporations states of origin became less important than international
agreements developed through the World Trade Organization and other
international institutions. Emerging from these multinational corporations
was a transnational capitalist class, whose loyalties and interests, while
still rooted in their corporations, was increasingly international in scope.
Sklair writes:
The transnational capitalist class can be
analytically divided into four main fractions:
(i) owners and controllers of TNCs and
their local affiliates
(ii) globalizing bureaucrats and
politicians
(iii) globalizing professionals
(iv) consumerist elites (merchants and
media)...
It is also important to note, of course,
that
the TCC [transnational corporate class]
and each of its fractions
are not always entirely united on every issue.
Nevertheless, together, leading personnel in
these groups constitute a global power elite, dominant class or inner
circle in the sense that these terms have been used to characterize the
dominant class structures of specific countries.3
Estimates are that the total worlds wealth is
close to $200 trillion, with the US and Europe holding approximately 63
percent.
To be among the wealthiest half of the world, an
adult needs only $4,000 in assets once debts have been subtracted. An adult
requires more than $72,000 to belong to the top 10 percent of global wealth
holders, and more than $588,000 to be a member of the top 1 percent. As of
2010, the top 1 percent of the wealthiest people in the world had hidden
away between $21 trillion to $32 trillion in secret tax exempt bank accounts
spread all over the world.4
Meanwhile, the poorest half of the global
population together possesses less than 2 percent of global wealth.5
The World Bank reports that, in 2008, 1.29
billion people were living in extreme poverty, on less than $1.25 a day, and
1.2 billion more were living on less than $2.00 a day.6
Starvation.net reports that 35,000 people,
mostly young children, die every day from starvation in the world.7
The numbers of unnecessary deaths have exceeded 300 million people over the
past forty years. Farmers around the world grow more than enough food to
feed the entire world adequately.
Global grain production yielded a record
2.3 billion tons in 2007, up 4 percent from the year before - yet, billions
of people go hungry every day.
Grain.org describes the core reasons for
ongoing hunger in a recent article, Corporations Are Still Making a Killing
from Hunger:
while farmers grow enough food to feed the world, commodity
speculators and huge grain traders like
Cargill control global food prices
and distribution.8
Addressing the power of the global 1 percent -
identifying who they are and what their goals are - are clearly life and
death questions.
It is also important to examine the questions of
how wealth is created, and how it becomes concentrated. Historically, wealth
has been captured and concentrated through conquest by various powerful
entities. One need only look at Spains appropriation of the wealth of the
Aztec and Inca empires in the early sixteenth century for an historical
example of this process. The histories of the Roman and British empires are
also filled with examples of wealth captured.
Once acquired, wealth can then be used to
establish means of production, such as the early British cotton mills, which
exploit workers labor power to produce goods whose exchange value is
greater than the cost of the labor, a process analyzed by Karl Marx in
Capital.9
A human being
is able to produce a product that has a certain value. Organized business
hires workers who are paid below the value of their labor power. The result
is the creation of what Marx called surplus value, over and above the cost
of labor.
The creation of surplus value allows those who own the means of
production to concentrate capital even more. In addition, concentrated
capital accelerates the exploitation of natural resources by private
entrepreneurs - even though these natural resources are actually the common
heritage of all living beings.10
In this article, we ask:
Who are the the worlds
1 percent power elite? And to what extent do they operate in unison for
their own private gains over benefits for the 99 percent?
We will examine a
sample of the 1 percent:
the extractor sector, whose companies are on the
ground extracting material from the global commons, and using low-cost labor
to amass wealth.
These companies include oil, gas, and various mineral
extraction organizations, whereby the value of the material removed far
exceeds the actual cost of removal.
We will also examine the investment sector of
the global 1 percent:
companies whose primary activity is the amassing and
reinvesting of capital.
This sector includes global central banks, major
investment money management firms, and other companies whose primary efforts
are the concentration and expansion of money, such as insurance companies.
Finally, we analyze how global networks of
centralized power - the elite 1 percent, their companies, and various
governments in their service - plan, manipulate, and enforce policies that
benefit their continued concentration of wealth and power.
The Extractor Sector -
The Case of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)
Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is the worlds largest
extractor of copper and gold.
The company controls huge deposits in Papua,
Indonesia, and also operates in North and South America, and in Africa. In
2010, the company sold 3.9 billion pounds of copper, 1.9 million ounces of
gold, and 67 million pounds of molybdenum.
In 2010, Freeport-McMoRan
reported revenues of $18.9 billion and a net income of $4.2 billion.11
The
Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia, employs
23,000 workers at wages below three dollars an hour. In September 2011,
workers went on strike for higher wages and better working conditions.
Freeport had offered a 22 percent increase in wages, and strikers said it
was not enough, demanding an increase to an international standard of
seventeen to forty-three dollars an hour.
The dispute over pay attracted
local tribesmen, who had their own grievances over land rights and
pollution; armed with spears and arrows, they joined Freeport workers
blocking the mines supply roads.12 During the strikers attempt
to block busloads of replacement workers, security forces financed by
Freeport killed or wounded several strikers.
Freeport has come under fire internationally for
payments to authorities for security.
Since 1991, Freeport has paid nearly
thirteen billion dollars to the Indonesian government - one of Indonesias
largest sources of income - at a 1.5 percent royalty rate on extracted gold
and copper, and, as a result, the Indonesian military and regional police
are in their pockets.
In October 2011, the Jakarta Globe reported
that Indonesian security forces in West Papua, notably the police, receive
extensive direct cash payments from Freeport-McMoRan. Indonesian National
Police Chief Timur Pradopo admitted that officers received close to ten
million dollars annually from Freeport, payments Pradopo described as lunch
money.
Prominent Indonesian nongovernmental organization Imparsial puts the
annual figure at fourteen million dollars.13
These payments
recall even larger ones made by Freeport to Indonesian military forces over
the years which, once revealed, prompted a US Security and Exchange
Commission investigation of Freeports liability under the United States
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
In addition, the states police and army have
been criticized many times for human rights violations in the remote
mountainous region, where a separatist movement has simmered for decades.
Amnesty International has documented numerous cases in which Indonesian
police have used unnecessary force against strikers and their supporters.
For example, Indonesian security forces attacked a mass gathering in the
Papua capital, Jayapura, and striking workers at the Freeport mine in the
southern highlands. At least five people were killed and many more injured
in the assaults, which shows a continuing pattern of overt violence against
peaceful dissent.
Another brutal and unjustified attack on October 19, 2011,
on thousands of Papuans exercising their rights to assembly and freedom of
speech, resulted in the death of at least three Papuan civilians, the
beating of many, the detention of hundreds, and the arrest of six,
reportedly on treason charges.14
On November 7, 2011, the Jakarta Globe
reported that,
striking workers employed by Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Golds
subsidiary in Papua have dropped their minimum wage increase demands from
$7.50 to $4.00 an hour, the All-Indonesia Workers Union (SPSI) said.15
Virgo Solosa, an official from the union, told the Jakarta Globe
that they considered the demands, up from the (then) minimum wage of $1.50
an hour, to be the best solution for all.
Workers at Freeports
Cerro Verde copper mine in
Peru also went on strike around the same time, highlighting the global
dimension of the Freeport confrontation. The Cerro Verde workers demanded
pay raises of 11 percent, while the company offered just 3 percent.
The Peruvian strike ended on November 28, 2011.16
And on December 14, 2011, Freeport-McMoRan announced a settlement at the
Indonesian mine, extending the unions contract by two years. Workers at the
Indonesia operation are to see base wages, which currently start at as
little as $2.00 an hour, rise 24 percent in the first year of the pact and
13 percent in the second year. The accord also includes improvements in
benefits and a one-time signing bonus equivalent to three months of wages.17
In both Freeport strikes, the governments
pressured strikers to settle. Not only was domestic military and police
force evident, but also higher levels of international involvement.
Throughout the Freeport-McMoRan strike, the
Obama administration ignored the
egregious violation of human rights and instead advanced US-Indonesian
military ties.
US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, who arrived in
Indonesia in the immediate wake of the Jayapura attack, offered no criticism
of the assault and reaffirmed US support for Indonesias territorial
integrity. Panetta also reportedly commended Indonesias handling of a
weeks-long strike at Freeport-McMoRan.18
US President Barack Obama visited Indonesia in
November 2011 to strengthen relations with Jakarta as part of Washingtons
escalating efforts to combat Chinese influence in the Asia-Pacific region.
Obama had just announced that the US and Australia would begin a rotating
deployment of 2,500 US Marines to a base in Darwin, a move ostensibly to
modernize the US posture in the region, and to allow participation in joint
training with Australian military counterparts.
But some speculate that the
US has a hidden agenda in deploying marines to Australia.
The Thai newspaper
The Nation has suggested that one of the reasons why US Marines
might be stationed in Darwin could be that they would provide remote
security assurance to US-owned Freeport-McMoRans gold and copper mine in
West Papua, less than a two-hour flight away.19
The fact that workers at Freeports Sociedad
Minera Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru were also striking at the same time
highlights the global dimension of the Freeport confrontation. The Peruvian
workers are demanding pay rises of eleven percent, while the company has
offered just three percent. The strike was lifted on November 28, 2011.
The fact
that the US Secretary of Defense mentioned a domestic strike in Indonesia
shows that the highest level of power are in play on issues affecting the
international corporate 1 percent and their profits.
Public opinion is strongly against
Freeport in Indonesia.
On August 8, 2011, Karishma Vaswani of the BBC
reported that,
the US mining firm Freeport-McMoRan has been accused of
everything from polluting the environment to funding repression in its four
decades working in the Indonesian province of Papau... Ask any Papuan on the
street what they think of Freeport and they will tell you that the firm is a
thief, said Nelels Tebay, a Papuan pastor and coordinator of the Papua Peace
Network. 21
Freeport strikers won support from the US
Occupy movement.
Occupy Phoenix and East Timor Action Network activists
marched to Freeport headquarters in Phoenix on October 28, 2011, to
demonstrate against the Indonesian police killings at Freeport-McMoRans
Grasberg mine.22
Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) chairman of the board
James R. Moffett owns over four million shares with a value of close to
$42.00 each. According to the FCX annual meeting report released in June
2011, Moffetts annual compensation from FCX in 2010 was $30.57 million.
Richard C. Adkerson, president of the board of FCX, owns over 5.3 million
shares.
His total compensation in was also $30.57 million in 2010 Moffetts
and Adkersons incomes put them in the upper levels of the worlds top 1
percent.
Their inter-connectness with the highest levels
of power in the White House and the Pentagon, as indicated by the specific
attention given to them by the US secretary of defense, and as suggested by
the US presidents awareness of their circumstances, leaves no doubt that
Freeport-MacMoRan executives and board are firmly positioned at the highest
levels of the transnational corporate class.

The board of directors of Freeport-McMoRan
represents a portion of the global 1 percent who not only control the
largest gold and copper mining company in the world, but who are also
interconnected by board membership with over two dozen major multinational
corporations, banks, foundations, military, and policy groups.
This twelve-member board is a tight network of
individuals who are interlocked with - and influence the policies of - other
major companies controlling approximately $200 billion in annual revenues.
Freeport-McMoRan exemplifies how the extractor
sector acquires wealth from the common heritage of natural materials - which
rightfully belongs to us all - by appropriating the surplus value of working
peoples labor in the theft of our commons.
This process is protected by governments in
various countries where Freeport maintains mining operations, with the
ultimate protector being the military empire of the US and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Further, Freeport-McMoRan is connected to one of
the most elite transnational capitalist groups in the world: over 7 percent
of Freeports stock is held by
BlackRock, Inc., a major investment
management firm based in New York City.
The Investment Sector -
The Case of BlackRock, Inc.
Internationally, many firms operate primarily as
investment organizations, managing capital and investing in other companies.
These firms often do not actually make anything except money, and are keen
to prevent interference with return on capital by taxation, regulations, and
governmental interventions anywhere in the world.
BlackRock, based in Manhattan, is the
largest assets management firm in the world, with over 10,000 employees and
investment teams in twenty-seven countries.
Their client base includes,
BlackRock acquired Barclay Global Investors in
December of 2009.
As of March 2012, BlackRock manages assets worth $3.68
trillion in equity, fixed income, cash management, alternative investment,
real estate, and advisory strategies.23
In addition to Freeport-McMoRan, BlackRock
has major holdings in,
-
Chevron (49 million shares, 2.5 percent)
-
Goldman
Sachs Group (13 million shares, 2.7 percent)
-
Exxon Mobil (121 million
shares, 2.5 percent)
-
Bank of America (251 million shares, 2.4 percent)
-
Monsanto Company (12 million shares, 2.4 percent)
-
Microsoft Corp. (185
million shares, 2.2 percent),
...and many more.24
BlackRock manages investments of both public and
private funds, including,
-
California Public Employees Retirement System
-
California State Teachers Retirement System
-
Freddie Mac

According to BlackRocks April 2011 annual
report to stockholders, the board of directors consists of eighteen members.
The board is classified into three equal groups - Class I, Class II, and
Class III - with terms of office of the members of one class expiring each
year in rotation.
Members of one class are generally elected at each annual
meeting and serve for full three-year terms, or until successors are elected
and qualified. Each class consists of approximately one-third of the total
number of directors constituting the entire board of directors.
BlackRock has stockholder agreements with,
-
Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America
Corporation

A 2011 University of Zurich study, research
completed by Stefania Vitali, James B. Glattfelder, Stefano Battiston at the
Swiss Federal Institute, reports that a small group of companies - mainly
banks - wields huge power over the global economy.26
Using
data from Orbis 2007, a database listing
thirty-seven million companies and investors, the Swiss researchers applied
mathematical models - usually used to model natural systems - to the world
economy. The study is the first to look at all 43,060 transnational
corporations and the web of ownership between them.
The research created a
map of 1,318 companies at the heart of the global economy. The study found
that 147 companies formed a super entity within this map, controlling some
40 percent of its wealth.
The top twenty-five of the 147 super-connected
companies includes:
-
Barclays PLC *
-
Capital Group Companies Inc.
-
FMR Corporation
-
AXA
-
State Street Corporation
-
J. P. Morgan Chase & Co.*

Notably, for our purposes, BlackRock board
members have direct connections to at least seven of the top twenty-five
corporations that Vitali et al. identify as an international super entity.
BlackRocks board has direct links to seven of
the twenty-five most interconnected corporations in the world. BlackRocks
eighteen board members control and influence tens of trillions of dollars of
wealth in the world and represent a core of the super-connected financial
sector corporations.

The directors of these super-connected companies
represent a small portion of the global 1 percent.
Most people with assets
in excess of $588,000 are not major players in international finance. At
best, they hire asset management firms to produce a return on their capital.
Often their net worth is tied up in nonfinancial
assets such a real estate and businesses.
Analysis - TCC and
Global Power
So how does the transnational corporate
class (TCC) maintain wealth concentration and power in the world?
The
wealthiest 1 percent of the worlds population represents approximately
forty million adults. These forty million people are the richest segment of
the first tier populations in the core countries and intermittently in other
regions.
Most of this 1 percent have professional jobs
with security and tenure working for or associated with established
institutions. Approximately ten million of these individuals have assets in
excess of one million dollars, and approximately 100,000 have financials
assets worth over thirty million dollars.
Immediately below the 1 percent in
the first tier are working people with regular employment in major
corporations, government, self-owned businesses, and various institutions of
the world.
-
This first tier constitutes about 30-40 percent
of the employed in the core developed countries, and some 30 percent in the
second tier economies and down to 20 percent in the periphery economies
(sometimes referred to as the 3rd world).
-
The second tier of global workers represents
growing armies of casual labor: the global factory workers, street workers,
and day laborers intermittently employed with increasingly less support from
government and social welfare organizations.
These workers, mostly
concentrated in the megacities, constitute some 30-40 percent of the workers
in the core industrialized economies and some 20 percent in the second tier
and peripheral economies.
-
This leaves a third tier of destitute people
worldwide ranging from 30 percent of adults in the core and secondary
economies to fully 50 percent of the people in peripheral countries who
have extremely limited income opportunities and struggle to survive on a few
dollars a day.
-
These are the 2.5 billion people who live on less than two
dollars a day, die by the tens of thousands every day from malnutrition and
easily curable illnesses, and who have probably never even heard a dial
tone.27
As seen in our extractor sector and investment
sector samples, corporate elites are interconnected through direct board
connections with some seventy major multinational corporations, policy
groups, media organizations, and other academic or nonprofit institutions.
The investment sector sample shows much more powerful financial links than
the extractor sample; nonetheless, both represent vast networks of resources
concentrated within each companys board of directors.
The short sample of directors and resources from
eight other of the super-connected companies replicates this pattern of
multiple board corporate connections, policy groups, media and government,
controlling vast global resources. These interlock relationships recur
across the top interconnected companies among the transnational corporate
class, resulting in a highly concentrated and powerful network of
individuals who share a common interest in preserving their elite
domination.
Sociological research shows that
interlocking directorates have the potential to facilitate political
cohesion.
A sense of a collective we emerges within such power networks,
whereby members think and act in unison, not just for themselves and their
individual firms, but for a larger sense of purpose - the good of the order,
so to speak.28
Transnational corporate boards meet on a regular
basis to encourage the maximization of profit and the long-term viability
of their firms business plans. If they arrange for payments to government
officials, conduct activities that undermine labor organizations, seek to
manipulate the price of commodities (e.g. gold), or engage in insider trading
in some capacity, they are in fact forming conspiratorial alliances inside
those boards of directors.
Our sample of thirty directors inside two
connected companies have influence with some of the most powerful policy
groups in the world, including,
They influence some ten trillion dollars in monetary resources and
control the working lives of many hundreds of thousands of people.
All in
all, they are a power elite unto themselves, operating in a world of power
elite networks as the de facto ruling class of the capitalist
world.
Moreover, this 1 percent global elite
dominates and controls public relations firms and
the corporate media.
Global corporate media protect the interests of the 1 percent by serving as
a propaganda machine for the superclass. The corporate media provide
entertainment for the masses and distorts the realities of inequality.
Corporate news is managed by the 1 percent to maintain illusions of hope and
to divert blame from the powerful for hard times.29
Four of the thirty directors in our two-firm
sample are directly connected with public relations and media.
Thomas H.
OBrien and Ivan G. Seidenberg are both on the board of Verizon
Communications, where Seidenberg serves as chairman. Verizon reported over
$110 billion in operating revenues in 2011.30
David H. Komansky and Linda Gosden Robinson are
on the board of
WPP Group, which describes itself as the world leader in
marketing communications services, grossing over $65 billion in 2011.
WPP is
a conglomerate of many of the worlds leading PR and marketing firms, in
fields that include advertising, media investment management, consumer
insight, branding and identity, health care communications, and direct
digital promotion and relationship marketing.31
Even deeper inside the 1 percent of wealthy
elites is what David Rothkopf calls the superclass.
David Rothkopf, former
managing director of Kissinger Associates and deputy undersecretary of
commerce for international trade policies, published his book Superclass:
the Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making, in 2008.32
According to Rothkopf, the superclass constitutes approximately 0.0001
percent of the worlds population, comprised of 6,000 to 7,000 people - some
say 6,660.
They are the,
-
Davos-attending
-
Gulfstream/private jet-flying
-
money-incrusted
-
megacorporation-interlocked
-
policy-building elites of the
world,
...people at the absolute peak of the global power pyramid.
They are 94
percent male, predominantly white, and mostly from North America and Europe.
These are the people setting the agendas at the,
They are from the highest levels of finance capital,
transnational corporations, the government, the military, the academy,
nongovernmental organizations, spiritual leaders, and other shadow elites.
Shadow elites include, for instance, the deep politics of national security
organizations in connection with international drug cartels,
who extract
8,000 tons of opium from US war zones annually, then launder $500 billion
through transnational banks, half of which are US-based.33
Rothkofts understanding of the superclass is
one based on influence and power.
Although there are over 1,000 billionaires
in the world, not all are necessarily part of the superclass in terms of
influencing global policies. Yet these 1,000 billionaires have twice as much
wealth as the 2.5 billion least wealthy people, and they are fully aware of
the vast inequalities in the world. The billionaires and the global 1
percent are similar to colonial plantation owners.
They know they are a
small minority with vast resources and power, yet they must continually
worry about the unruly exploited masses rising in rebellion. As a result of
these class insecurities, the superclass works hard to protect this
structure of concentrated wealth.
Protection of capital is the prime reason
that NATO countries now account for 85 percent of the worlds defense
spending, with the US spending more on military than the rest of the world
combined. 34
Fears of inequality rebellions and other forms of
unrest motivate NATOs global agenda in the
war on terror.35
The Chicago 2012 NATO Summit Declaration reads:
As Alliance leaders, we are determined to ensure
that NATO retains and develops the capabilities necessary to perform its
essential core tasks collective defence, crisis management and cooperative
security - and thereby to play an essential role promoting security in the
world.
We must meet this responsibility while dealing with an acute
financial crisis and responding to evolving geo-strategic challenges. NATO
allows us to achieve greater security than any one Ally could attain acting
alone.
We confirm the continued importance of a strong
transatlantic link and Alliance solidarity as well as the significance of
sharing responsibilities, roles, and risks to meet the challenges
North-American and European Allies face together... we have confidently set
ourselves the goal of NATO Forces 2020: modern, tightly connected forces
equipped, trained, exercised and commanded so that they can operate together
and with partners in any environment.36
NATO is quickly emerging as the police force for
the transnational corporate class.
As the TCC more fully emerged in the
1980s, coinciding with the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics (USSR), NATO began broader operations. NATO first ventured into
the Balkans, where it remains, and then moved into Afghanistan. NATO started
a training mission in Iraq in 2005, has recently conducted operations in
Libya, and, as of July 2012, is considering military action in Syria.
It has become clear that the superclass uses
NATO for its global security.
This is part of an expanding strategy of US
military domination around the world, whereby the US/NATO
military-industrial-media empire operates in service to the transnational
corporate class for the protection of international capital anywhere in the
world.37
Sociologists William Robinson and
Jerry Harris anticipated this situation in 2000, when they described,
a shift from the social welfare state to
the social control (police) state replete with the dramatic expansion of
public and private security forces, the mass incarceration of the
excluded populations (disproportionately minorities), new forms of
social apartheid... and anti-immigrant legislation.38
Robinson and Harriss theory accurately predicts
the agenda of todays global superclass, including,
-
President Obamas continuation of
the
police state agendas of his executive predecessors,
George W. Bush,
Bill Clinton, and George H. W. Bush
-
the long-range global dominance agenda
of the superclass, which uses US/NATO military forces to discourage
resisting states and maintain internal police repression, in service
of the capitalist systems orderly maintenance
-
the continued consolidation of capital
around the world without interference from governments or
egalitarian social movements 39
Furthermore, this agenda leads to the further
pauperization of the poorest half of the worlds population, and an
unrelenting downward spiral of wages for everyone in the second tier, and
even some within the first tier.40
-
It is a world facing economic crisis, where the
neoliberal solution is to spend less on human needs and more on security.41
-
It is a world of financial institutions run amok, where the answer to
bankruptcy is to print more money through quantitative easing with trillions
of new inflation-producing dollars.
-
It is a world of permanent war, whereby
spending for destruction requires even more spending to rebuild, a cycle
that profits the TCC and its global networks of economic power.
-
It is a
world of drone killings, extrajudicial assassinations, and death and
destruction, at home and abroad.
As Andrew Kollin states in State Power
and Democracy,
There is an Orwellian dimension to the
Administrations (Bush and later Obama) perspective, it chose to
disregard the law, instead creating decrees to legitimate illegal
actions, giving itself permission to act without any semblances of power
sharing as required by the Constitution or international law. 42
And in Globalization and the
Demolition of Society, Dennis Loo writes,
The bottom line, the fundamental division
of our society, is between, on the one hand, those whose interests rest
on the dominance and the drive for monopolizing the society and planets
resources and, on the other hand, those whose interests lie in the
husbanding of those resources for the good of the whole rather than the
part. 43
The Occupy movement uses the 1 percent vs. 99
percent mantra as a master concept in its demonstrations, disruptions, and
challenges to the practices of the transnational corporate class, within
which the global superclass is a key element in the implementation of a
superelite agenda for permanent war and total social control.
Occupy is exactly what the superclass fears the
most - a global democratic movement that exposes the TCC agenda and the
continuing theater of government elections, wherein the actors may change
but the marquee remains the same.
The more that Occupy refuses to cooperate with
the TCC agenda and mobilizes activists, the more likely the whole TCC system
of dominance will fall to its knees under the people power of democratic
movements.
