by Richard Boylan,
Ph.D.
Dr. Michael Wolf
has since 1979 served as a scientific consultant to the President
and the National Security Council on extraterrestrial matters, and a
member of its Majestic Twelve (MJ-12),
UFO-secrecy management agencys, Special Studies Group, and has been
in charge of its lead agency, the Alphacom Team.
Previously he has served as an Air Force Colonel, pilot, flight
surgeon and counter-intelligence officer for the CIA
and NSA.
He has an MD
in Neurology, a
Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics, a ScD
in Computer Science, a JD in Law, an
M.S. in EM influence on organisms, and a
B.S. in biogenetics.
Dr. Wolf has
decided to reveal to the world what he has learned inside secret
government programs about the visiting extraterrestrial cultures, "because
we have a right to know."
His book,
The
Catchers of Heaven (1996) makes many
well-informed revelations.
Dr. Wolf states
that the most important mission objective of his
Alphacom Team is resumption of negotiations with the
visiting extraterrestrials. In the 1950s, the U.S. administration
entered into treaty terms with the so-called Grey
extraterrestrials from the fourth planet
of the star system
Zeta Reticuli, but these treaties were never ratified as
Constitutionally required.
The Greys shared certain of their
technological advances with military/intelligence scientists,
apparently often while prisoner "guests" within secure underground
military installations in Nevada and New Mexico. The
extraterrestrials have given the U.S. government some of their
antigravity craft and a
huge amount of fuel (element 115).
On May 1, 1975
during one such technology exchange in Nevada, a demonstration of a
small ET antimatter reactor, the lead Grey asked the Colonel in
charge of the Delta Forces guarding the ETs to remove
all their rifles and bullets from the room, (so that they would not
accidentally discharge during the energy emissions.)
The guards
refused, and in the ensuing commotion a guard opened fire on the Greys.
One alien, two scientists and 41 military personnel were
killed. One guard was left alive to attest that the ETs
apparently used directed mental energy in self-defense to kill the
other attacking Delta Forces.
Dr. Wolf states that,
"this
incident ended certain exchanges with (the Greys)."
Military/intelligence scientists learned cloning techniques from the
extraterrestrials.
After perfecting cloning techniques on animals,
Dr. Wolf and his associates cloned an artificial-intelligence
human being, "J-Type Omega", as part of Project
SENTINEL, an effort to create a superbright, superpowerful
soldier who would follow orders without fear or question.
The J-Type
clone was terminated, because he would not follow an order to kill
an innocent dog, because Dr. Wolf had surreptitiously
programmed ethics into his artificial intelligence.
Wolf notes that the extraterrestrials are not
comfortable with the world money and power brokers need for
continuing world industrialization, which they see as headed towards
planet-killing.
Another of the Alphacom Teams
missions is to determine,
"whether we can use the ETs technology
to restore this planet to its former pristine state of natural
balance."
The ETs are also concerned about the
massive proliferation of nuclear devices into many countries.
Wolf states that other missions of the MJ12SSGs Alphacom Team are:
-
to determine the number
and types of ET visitors,
-
the extent of visitation
and the reasons,
-
to learn about human
interactions with extraterrestrials in the past and currently,
-
the cultures of the
various off world visitors,
-
and how we can negotiate
with them.
According to Dr. Wolf,
several confederations of extraterrestrial civilizations are
visiting us in loosely-coordinated fashion. These are:
-
the Alliance
(of human-looking ETs from the Altair Aquila system),
-
the Corporate
(of Greys from the Zeta Reticuli system),
-
the Federation of
Worlds (of unspecified races from many star systems),
-
and the United Races
of Orion (cultures from those star systems).
-
Further, the Alliance is
in affiliation with the Corporate and with the Federation of Worlds.
-
The United Races of Orion
are in affiliation with the Corporate, and, through them, with the
Alliance and the Federation of Worlds.
Dr. Wolf told
of learning during a high-level briefing in the UK that
the Vatican had been applying pressure concerning the
possible announcement by President Clinton of UFO
visitation.
Of specific
Vatican concern was,
"whether he will make reference to
the extraterrestrial biological entities data revealing in detail
how religion was created and why".
Wolf comments,
"Rich organized religions feel threatened by such an announcement."
Perhaps Wolfs most startling revelation is that within the UFO
Cover-Up there is a dark, covert renegade organization known as
the "Cabal".
He describes it as,
"well-orchestrated
conspiratorial bevy of plotters... top-heavy with the military, and
headed by (a Navy Under- Secretary)."
The paranoiac Cabal
works against, and deliberately undermines, the goals of peaceful
negotiations with the extraterrestrial visitors. The
Cabal uses Star Wars weapons to shoot down
extraterrestrial spacecraft and overcome the ETS by
military might.
Wolf concludes by stating,
"In all of my preparation as
a scientist, nothing ever prepared me for our visitors. We must
understand the complexity of the various forces at work on this
planet, and yes, on others. Let us not forget multi-dimensionality
and space-time distortions, and the spirituality we must
regain.
I feel I must also mention that spirituality is
gaining strength on this planet, this Sol Three. But also is the
evil. We have the power to sanction whatever is ...for a better good
for mankind."
