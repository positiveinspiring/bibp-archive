Islamabad -
A prominent official in the Afghan Taleban movement announced
yesterday the death of Osama bin Laden, the
chief
of al-Qa'da organization, stating that bin Laden suffered serious
complications in the lungs and died a natural and quiet death.
The official, who asked to remain
anonymous, stated to The Observer of Pakistan that he had
himself attended the funeral of bin Laden and saw his face prior
to burial in Tora Bora 10 days ago.
He mentioned that 30 of al-Qa'da
fighters attended the burial as well as members of his family
and some friends from the Taleban. In the farewell ceremony to
his final rest guns were fired in the air.
The official stated that it is
difficult to pinpoint the burial location of bin Laden because
according to the Wahhabi tradition no mark is left by the grave.
He stressed that it is unlikely that the American forces would
ever uncover any traces of bin Laden.
