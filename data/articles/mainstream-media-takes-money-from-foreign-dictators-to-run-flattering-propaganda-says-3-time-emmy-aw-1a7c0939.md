American News Networks
...Run
Infomericals for Foreign Dictators
Pretend Its Actual Reporting
If youve been paying attention, you know that
the American media
act as presstitutes for rich and powerful Americans. But it turns out
that the American media will turn tricks for foreign johns as well
Specifically, three time Emmy award winning
reporter Amber Lyon was until very recently a respected CNN reporter:
Lyon was fired from CNN after she refused to
stop reporting on her first-hand experience of the systematic torture and
murder of peaceful protesters by the government of Bahrain.
Lyons special report on Bahrain was scheduled
to run on both CNNs U.S. and international networks, but was pulled after
only a limited showing due to pressure from the Bahrainis and their
lobbyists:
CNN
Amber Lyon Report On Bahrain
22-04-2011
At the same time that Lyon was risking her life
to do on-the-ground reporting in Bahrain, another CNN journalist was filming
a paid propaganda piece on how the Bahraini leaders are a bunch of friendly
pro-democracy reformers.
Thats right
the Bahraini government
paid CNN to do what was literally an infomercial for that brutal
regime and pretend it was real journalism.
Lyon says that China and many other foreign,
authoritarian regimes also pay CNN and other mainstream networks to run
flattering propaganda pieces.

The Amber Lyon
story is just the latest in a series of articles that
expose the total Joseph Goebbels like censorship rampant
in mainstream media today.
The first one I
posted several weeks ago exposed how the NY Times
basically just regurgitates whatever government
officials tell them, while the other showcased how an
NPR reporter covering D.C. had to leave and do her own
thing out of frustration.
This is precisely
why alternative media sites are taking off. They provide
the only outlets left for genuine journalism.

So back to Amber. Back in March 2011, CNN sent a four
person team to Bahrain to cover the Arab Spring.
Once there, the
crew was the subject of extreme intimidation amongst
other things, but they were able to record some
fantastic footage.
As Glenn Greenwald
of the UK's Guardian writes in his blockbuster article
from today:
"In the
segment, Lyon interviewed activists as they
explicitly described their torture at the hands of
government forces, while family members recounted
their relatives' abrupt disappearances. She spoke
with government officials justifying the
imprisonment of activists.
And the segment
featured harrowing video footage of regime forces
shooting unarmed demonstrators, along with the mass
arrests of peaceful protesters.
In sum, the
early 2011 CNN segment on Bahrain presented one of
the starkest reports to date of the brutal
repression embraced by the US-backed regime.
Despite these accolades, and despite the dangers
their own journalists and their sources endured to
produce it, CNN International (CNNi) never broadcast
the documentary.
Even in the
face of numerous inquiries and complaints from their
own employees inside CNN, it continued to refuse to
broadcast the program or even provide any
explanation for the decision.
To date, this
documentary has never aired on CNNi.
Having just returned from Bahrain, Lyon says she
"saw first-hand that these regime claims were lies,
and I couldn't believe CNN was making me put what I
knew to be government lies into my reporting."
We are grateful for Ms. Lyons expos√© of this
revolting practice
especially because real reporting is
treated as terrorism by the American government.
