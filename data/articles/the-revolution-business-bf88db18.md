Democratic change has been demanded across the
Middle East. But was what seems like a spontaneous revolution actually a
strategically planned event, fabricated by 'revolution consultants' long in
advance?
Revolution consultants are the worst nightmare of every regime.
Srdja Popovic was a founder of the
organization 'Otpor', a revolution training school. It was instrumental in
the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic in the 1990s and has now inspired a new
generation of activists.
Political commentators like William Engdahl
are convinced Otpor is being financed by the USA.
"The people from Otpor gave us a book in
which they described all their strategies", says Ezzedine Zaatour of the
Tunisian uprising.
That book was written by an American, Gene
Sharp, and is now considered the "revolution guide book", being used by
opposition movements worldwide.
As Optor release their latest gadget, a
resistance training computer game sponsored by American organizations, world
leaders are voicing their concerns.
"This is called a gentle coup!", insists
Hugo Chavez.
