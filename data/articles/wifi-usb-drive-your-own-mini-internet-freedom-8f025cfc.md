# WiFi + USB Drive = Your Own Mini-Internet (Freedom)

Worried about draconian
Internet laws?
-
Creeping surveillance?
-
The inability to share with
others without being criminalized? The Internet is still
a tool of tremendous power, but a deep rot has set in.
We have caught it early and we are
fighting to stop this rot, but there are other options we can begin
exploring to hedge our bets, enhance our current efforts of fighting
against corporate monopolies, and eventually,
build an Internet of the people, by the people, for the people -
big-telecom monopolies not welcomed.

Once the PirateBox is up
and running, either on a standalone device like
the one pictured to the right (background), or
on your laptop
as described here,
it will appear as another WiFi network for
people in range to connect to.
Once connected files can be freely shared, and
there is even a chat client users can
communicate with.
It is just as useful as a file server for a
small business, as it is for circumventing the
draconian criminalization of Internet file
sharing.
In last week's "Fighting
Back Against the "Intellectual Property" Racket," the "PirateBox"
was introduced.
The PirateBox transforms a laptop,
router, or single board computer into a mini-Internet hub where
files can be freely shared, and even features a chat program so
users can communicate. It is a lite version of the mesh networks
described in December 2012's "Decentralizing
Telecom" where independent mesh networks featured many software
alternatives to emulate popular online programs such as Facebook,
Twitter, Blogger, and others.
The PirateBox is an introductory project
anyone with a WiFi adapter and a USB thumbdrive can do on their own
with a little motivation and an hour to experiment.
In a busy office, a PirateBox can serve as a simple local wireless
file server and chat client. In an apartment complex, it can become
the center of a social experiment, an opportunity to reach out to
neighbors and organize constructively, or just for fun - building
badly needed local communities back up.
Instructions for perhaps the easiest of PirateBox's implementations
can be found on blogger, designer, and activist
David Darts'
website here. The instructions are nearly fool proof, and a lot
of the common problems ran into are described and their solutions
linked to throughout the explanation.
The PirateBox does not connect to the Internet, nor does it operate
from your hard drive. It works entirely on the USB thumbdrive you
install it on, simply using your computer's WiFi to network all who
are in range.
Ideally you'd want to make a dedicated, standalone PirateBox to
serve your space, office, and neighbors. A great place for beginners
to embark on this is at your local hackerspace. If you don't have a
local hackerspace,
look into starting one up.
Protesting is important, but protesting alone will not stem the
problem at its source. The rot will continue to spread unless we
develop tangible tools to pragmatically excise it and repair the
damage it has already done.
The problem of
corporate monopolies ensnaring and subjugating us through their
telecom monopolies can and is being solved by solutions like mesh
networks, the PirateBox, and the onward march of open source
software and hardware, simply displacing proprietary products and
services.
The best way to ensure success is to
have as many informed and constructive people as possible join in
the problem-solving process.
Editor's Note: There seems to
be some confusion over the concept of the PirateBox.
The entire
point is not to be connected to the controlled,
restricted, & monopolized Internet, and begin using local
alternatives leveraging technology to go around draconian laws
and regulations.
A PirateBox is the smallest, but
easiest way to connect with others locally and wirelessly, as
well as anonymously, without connecting at all to the Internet.
It is the first step to building
larger local mesh networks, and eventually a parallel Internet
built using mesh architecture designed, maintained, and used by
the people, for the people - no government or corporate
infrastructure would be required, and the means of monopolizing
and controlling
a decentralized people's Internet made nearly impossible.
Think of the PirateBox as a
prototype of a building block for something bigger and more
significant.
In the fight for freedom, we will not find complete
solutions, prepackaged and waiting for us on the shelves of WalMart. We will have to research and develop our own solutions,
patiently, incrementally, and in collaboration with our friends,
family, neighbors and local community.
Our problems were not
created overnight, neither will the solutions.
Since posting about the PirateBox, LocalOrg has received several
success stories of people who have either already been using it, or
have looked into it, prompting this follow up.
