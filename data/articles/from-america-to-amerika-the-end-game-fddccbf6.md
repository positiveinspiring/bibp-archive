America - The End Game
by Dennis Cimino and Jim Fetzer
NDAA, The National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, if you havent heard,
gives the U.S. military the authority to indefinitely detain without charge
and incarcerate any American citizen on U.S. soil, for reasons and on
grounds that the military does not have to disclose.
It is stunning that
this act subverts habeas corpus, originally formalized by an
Act of
Parliament in England (1679), but which recognized the long standing
practice that a citizen cannot be detained for prosecution by a court of law
without due process, including the right to know the charges being brought
against him and the right to legal representation.
If you ask perhaps how
this Senate bill and the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor are
related, the answer is not difficult to discern for multiple reasons,
including the treatment of Japanese-Americans in the wake of Pearl Harbor,
but especially because of the early warnings involved.
The truth is, imagine yourself being the Japanese emperor, and you send FDR
an advisory message warning him of your intention to attack Pearl Harbor. By
breaking the code the Japanese high command was using to communicate was,
militarily comparable, assuming the Japanese knew we had broken their code.
Look at the McCain and Levin amendments to this appropriations bill, and how
this is more or less the same thing as the Emperor Hirohito getting on the
phone and telling an Adversary who has embargoed his countrys access to oil
that he planned to retaliate. (see
Day of Deceit by Robert Stinnett)
In real life, you would expect the duly
informed party to take countermeasures to prevent taking it on the chin,
would you not? It is a highly probable response when a viable and verified
threat is issued from one party to another to take some form of rather
extreme action.
In the case of the McCain/Levin amendment, this is a warning to every
American citizen who takes issue with this corrupt, murderous, even
illegitimate government in Washington, D.C., no matter where they are here
in the United States, that the military now has a hunting license to come
get you and ferret you off to a secret gulag for torture and indefinite
incarceration.
As any reasonable person would do when so threatened, you
might well begin to prepare for that contingency. You might buy ammunition
and make sure your firearms are well serviced and ready. You might create
hard-to-penetrate-by-small-arms-fire zones in your basement if you have one,
or home.
You might go somewhere and get re-familiar with how to safely
defend your home from such an incredible, unConstitutional and even
treasonous intrusion by the armed forces of our own country.
Internment Camp Services Bid Arrives After NDAA
On 6 December 2011, Kurt Nimmo and Alex Jones reported that infowars.com has
received a document originating from KBR, a subsidiary of Halliburton, that
offers details of plans to activate FEMA and U.S. Army camps around the
United States.
Entitled Project Overview and Anticipated Project
Requirements, the document describes services that KBR is looking to farm
out to subcontractors.
As they explain,
Services up for bid include
catering, temporary fencing and barricades, laundry and medical services,
power generation, refuse collection, and other services required for
temporary emergency environment camps located in five regions of the
United States.
This means that the activation of those camps is not a
distant event but has become imminent.
As they report,
YouTube - Veterans Today -
KBRs call for FEMA camp service bids [has arrived] soon after the Senate
overwhelmingly passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which
permits the military to detain and interrogate supposed domestic terror
suspects [including OWS protesters] in violation of the Fourth Amendment and
Posse Comitatus.
Section 1031 of the NDAA bill declares the whole of the
United States as a battlefield and allows American citizens to be arrested
on U.S. soil and incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay.
On Section 1031 of the
Non-Detention Act of 1971
The Japanese American Citizens League (JACL),
the nations oldest and largest Asian American civil and human rights
organization, which is not surprising given the treatment Japanese-Americans
received in the wake of Pearl Harbor.
Thus,
In a letter addressed to
Congress, S. Floyd Mori, the national director of JACL, said the NDAA is the
first time that Congress has scaled back on the protections provided by the
Non-Detention Act of 1971, including Section 1031. Mori said the
legislation, if enacted and put into use, would be reminiscent of the
unconstitutional indefinite detention of Japanese Americans during World War
II.
KBR Instrumental in
Establishing Camps in 2006
As they also explain,
In 2006, KBR was awarded a contingency contract from
the Department of Homeland Security, allegedly to support its Immigration
and Customs Enforcement facilities in the event of an emergency," Market
Watch reported.
The contract was effective immediately and provided for
establishing temporary detention and processing capabilities to expand
existing ICE Detention and Removal Operations Program facilities in the
event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S., or to support the
rapid development of new programs, KBR said.
The contract may also provide
migrant detention support to other government organizations in the event of
an immigration emergency, as well as the development of a plan to react to a
national emergency, such as a natural disaster, the company explained.
Internment / Resettlement
Specialist (31E)
The sentence alluding to the rapid development
of new programs, of course, offers no indication of what those new
programs might be.
But, at this point in time, given the inclusion of
language in NDAA 2012 authorizing the apprehension and indefinite detention
of American citizens in violation of habeas corpus at the request of the
Obama administration, there can be scant reason to doubt that these new
programs are intended to suppress dissent by the most powerful possible
means, no matter how much the Constitution and Bill of Rights are thereby
obviated.
There are precursors for these events in European history, of
course, including the Enabling Act passed by the German Parliament at the
insistence of then-Chancellor Adolph Hitler.
Most U.S. citizens are ignorant
of those developments, even though they paved the way for The Third Reich.
And others remain infatuated with the notion of American exceptionalism,
which is a form of mass delusion that it cant happen here.
Unfortunately,
it not only can but actually is happening here!
Army Civilian Inmate
Labor Program
Enemy Prisoner of War/Civilian
Internee (EPW/CI) Camp
As Nimmo and Jones also report,
Soon after KBRs announcement, a
little-known Army document surfaced. Entitled the Civilian Inmate Labor
Program, the unclassified document describes in detail Army Regulation
210-35.
The regulation, first drafted in 1997, underwent a rapid act
revision in January 2005 and now provides a policy for the creation of
labor programs and prison camps on Army installations.
Moreover,
In 2009, the National Emergency Centers Act
or HR 645 was introduced in Congress. It mandates the establishment of
national emergency centers to be located on military installations for
the purpose of providing temporary housing, medical, and humanitarian
assistance to individuals and families dislocated due to an emergency or
major disaster, according to the bill.
In addition to emergencies, the
legislation is designed to meet other appropriate needs, as determined
by the Secretary of Homeland Security, an open ended mandate which many
fear could mean the forced detention of American citizens in the event
of widespread rioting after a national emergency or total economic
collapse, as Paul Joseph Watson noted in January of 2009.
Those fears, alas, are not coming to fruition.
Pearl Harbor and
the New Pearl Harbor
As history records, the U.S. Navy took one massive pasting in Pearl Harbor
on 7 December 1941.
B-17 bombers were arrayed in neat rows at the Naval Air
Station, Ford Island, in the middle of the harbor, while battleships - which
were no longer the core of the fleet and thus were moderately expendable,
while the carriers, which would be necessary to a war in the Pacific, had
been put to sea - were left at pier side.
The military was not on any alert
status of any kind, in spite of the fact that the intelligence community in
the United States had plenty of reason to do so.
The old Pearl Harbor has
now been succeeded by the new Pearl Harbor as a fabricated attack
intended to instill fear into the American people in order to manipulate us
to promote a political agenda.
The first event was allowed to happen to induce the citizens of this nation
to abandon isolationism and engage with our allies in World War II.
The
second event was made to happen to induce us to support wars of aggression
against nations that had never attacked us, with regard to our foreign
policy, and to surrender civil rights guaranteed under the Constitution, as
a matter of domestic politics, both of which were strikingly contrary to our
values and traditions.
The consequences of the new Pearl Harbor are now
coming to their culmination in the complete abdication of our Constitution
and the emplacement of a national security/police state. The question thus
becomes what we should do about it.
Telegraphing the actions that the government is about to take may have been
an unavoidable consequence of securing Congressional approval by the passage
of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2011. It was something that
those who are about to enslave us simply could not avoid.
But we have to ask
ourselves:
-
If you were issued advance warning that your government was about to go
rogue and abandon the last vestiges of the rule of law by shredding the
Constitution in front of you, would you not be disposed to take certain
actions to make it , if not very difficult, at least very stupid for
them to send soldiers to seize you for exercising your right of dissent?
-
Is
our own government counting on our naïveté to take for granted that our
Senators and Representatives are looking out for our best interests, just as
Bush and
Cheney were looking our for us on 9/11?
-
And when Sen. Carl Levin
has explained Obama himself wanted these provisions, how dumb are we?
We would guess that the number of citizens who have valid and quite genuine
disagreement with the outrageous and criminal policies of the government in
Washington, D.C., might represent as much as 20-30% of the adult population
and possibly more.
Applied to 300,000,000 citizens, that might equal roughly
60,000,000. If its half that, around 30,000,000; and half that, only
15,000,000.
Calculations done on the basis of the number of railroad cars
that Halliburton has been commissioned to construct times the number of
those they can carry using the shackles with which they are equipped
approximates 15,000,000 detainees.
So maybe that number is the closer
approximation.
A FEMA Camp awaiting
occupation by American civilians
Estimates have it that some 80,000,000 American citizens are armed, where
the certainty is that more than a hundred and fifty million households in
the U.S. have some form of firearm beyond a .22 caliber Saturday night
special, and at least two or three members of that household may well be
able to aim and fire it at an intruder, be they a thief or a person in a
police or a military uniform.
In any case,
since 9/11, we have had the
government put every one of us on the highest paranoia alert status in
American history with a series of fear mongering, wholly unjustified reasons
for us to either look for Muslims coming from every nook and cranny, as well
as the recent advice by Janet Napolitano, who would have each of us conduct
surveillance on our friends and neighbors
Where do we go from
here?
We have experienced the FBI having set up dozens of fake terror suspects,
and have had to endure insane scenarios such as underpants and shoe
bombers who either cant get the loads in their pants to go off or
effectively light a cigarette with repeated attempts.
We are told that a guy
with no passport was waltzed past security to board an international flight
without any problems, apparently because he was escorted by some official no
one has been able to identify.
We were conned about 19 Arab hijackers
magically overcoming the totality of the entire North American Defense
Command on 9/11 using box cutters as their weapons.
But it turns out that
the government has never been able to prove that they were actually aboard
any of those planes. And the alleged phone calls from all four planes turn
out to have been faked.
How dumb are we supposed to be?
These plans date at
least from REX 84
The government, it now appears, has given us a two year head start on arming
and loading to protect ourselves, even if it would have preferred not to
have done so.
By putting an advertisement for INTERNMENT SPECIALISTS with an
MOS of 31 ECHO in the advertising section of The Wall Street Journal and in
other printed media, when, since the Patriot Act was morphed three times,
they didnt have to say a public word and could have hired these specialists
in secret with a far more covert approach than by announcements in these
publications.
But the point may be to make it appear as though these moves
were undertaken in the public interest. After all, if something terrifying
and subversive were going on, it could be argued, why would it be done in
such a public fashion? But to ask the question is to answer it.
As Hitler
observed, BIG LIES are simply beyond the comprehension of most citizens - of
Germany or of any other country.
Tactically, it doesnt make any sense. Militarily the U.S. does not have the
troop strength to quell massive civil unrest without the use of
non-conventional force application.
Which is it? Is it another Pearl Harbor
let it happen on purpose like 7 December 1941 and, for that matter, also
similar to the 9/11 made it happen on purpose gambit used to
psychologically traumatize and induce fear into the the American public by
fabricating a non-existent enemy striking from the caves of Tora Bora?
The
threat of NDAA appears to be real but, to those of us who understand what
it represents, as ludicrous as Emperor Hirohito calling FDR on the phone and
telling him that on Sunday, 7 December 1941, he was going to attack the U.S.
fleet.
Something is seriously wrong with this picture.
Perhaps they want to
provoke a civil war that would justify to complete deconstruction of
America. Perhaps they are simply playing us for saps. It has worked before.
It can work again...
