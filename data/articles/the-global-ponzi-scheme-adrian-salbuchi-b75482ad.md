An Argentine opinion on the Global Financial Crisis.
Adrian Salbuchi
describes the whole
Global Financial System as one vast Ponzi Scheme. Like a
pyramid, it has four sides and is a predictable model.
The four sides are:
-
Artificially control the supply of
public State-issued Currency
-
Artificially impose Banking Money as the
primary source of funding in the economy
-
Promote doing everything by Debt
-
Erect complex channels that allow privatizing profits when the Model is
in expansion mode and socialize losses when the model goes into contraction
mode
Part 1
Part 2
