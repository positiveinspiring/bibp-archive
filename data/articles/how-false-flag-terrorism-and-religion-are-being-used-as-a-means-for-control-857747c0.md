Has religion really been used to control humanity?
I definitely believe so, and I think that it becomes self evident if one looks at the bulk of human history. There was a time when religion was indistinguishable from the state - either you were part of the church or you were considered a heretic.
Even the work of scientists like Galileo was completely banned and disregarded for years. The whole system of religion was, and still is (in some cases), based on fear.
If you don't do this, you'll go to hell, or if you don't do that, God will not be your friend and you will suffer, if you don't pay taxes to the church, you will be punished.
If the churches took half the money that they was making, and gave it back to the community we'd be alright. We'd be alright. If they take half the buildings they use to praise God and gave it to [people] who need God, we'd be alright. Have you seen some of these goddamn churches lately? There's ones that take up the whole block in New York. It's homeless people out here. Tupac Shakur

Below is video of Jon Shelby Spong, a retired American bishop of the Episcopal Church, discussing these problems:
He argues that religion is a business and it is used as a control mechanism (and he's not the first insider to do so).
We can see this happening most clearly in the rise of Islamophobia. Islam has been turned into a scapegoat, a target at which we can direct all our fears and anger, and an excuse to invade other countries and create a more intense global national security state.
But the truth is, Islam has nothing to do with violence or terrorism.
These manufactured fears are all part and parcel of 'false flag' terrorism, which you can read more about here if you are unfamiliar with the concept.
In the video, Spong affirms that,
"religion is always in the control business, and that's something people don't really understand. It's in the guilt producing control business."
It is not my aim to belittle or diminish anyone's beliefs.
My problem is not with faith but with religion as an organization, which has been used as a means of control, to pit people against each other, and to incite terror and war. Religion in this context serves the purposes of many various global elitist agendas.
I believe that if, you asked 'God' about religion, God would not be able to tell you what it is.
If you asked Jesus, Mohammad, or any other ancient religious figure, they would have no idea about the word religion, because (I believe) it was made by man. I think it would be difficult to dispute the argument that faith is not the same thing as religion.
Don't get me wrong, there are many points made in various religious texts that completely resonate with me and (obviously) millions of other people around the world. I've always felt that many of these texts were written in a time far different from what we are living in today.
I believe these texts were taken, used, and re-written by various people (which is why we see so many different versions).
Ultimately, I believe original sacred events, teachings, and revelations have been concealed, and new versions were created in order to control the people. I do believe religion is rooted in good will, but has been taken, twisted, and re-distributed, in a sense.
I also believe that various religious figures were indeed real, and they all shared one thing in common, and that was knowing the key for humanity to thrive.
The key is love.
What do you think...?
Terrorism is just one example of this kind of control.
Atrocities happen every day and most of them go unreported, but the ones that we do hear about have one thing in common, and that's blaming Muslims.
We label them as terrorists and then use that identification as justification to create a heightened national security state - one in which our rights are continually diminished through quiet legislature.
I personally believe these things are being used to justify the infiltration of other countries for ulterior motives, and I know I am not alone in my thoughts.
It seems clear that there is a wealth of evidence to prove this theory, but so many people are still believing everything they hear on television without ever questioning whether or not it is the truth, or a version of the truth, or outright false.
Statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them. And thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception.

It's called false flag terrorism, and it represents one modern day example of how religion is used to create a situation in which "the one percent" profit.
We are constantly bombarded with the idea that terrorist attacks like 9/11 and the more recent incidents in France are a result of the 'Islamic State.'
Is this really happening? According to many, it's not.
Millions, if not billions, of people around the world believe that these so-called 'terrorist' attacks are not being executed by those who represent any kind of religion. People are starting to wake up to this fact and paying more attention to alternative media outlets as a result.
It seems clear that there is no religion which would actually support such actions, so to equate terrorism with the Muslim faith is completely unacceptable.
We are dealing with a criminal undertaking at a global level and there is an ongoing war the global war on terrorism is a US undertaking, which is fake, it's based on fake premises. It tells us that somehow America and the Western world are going after a fictitious enemy, the Islamic State, when in fact the Islamic state is fully supported and financed by the Western military alliance... They say Muslims are terrorists, but it just so happens that terrorists are Made in America. They're not the product of Muslim society, and that should be abundantly clear to everyone on this floor. The global war on terrorism is a fabrication, a big lie and a crime against humanity. Dr. Michel Choissudovsky Canadian Economist & Ottawa's Professor of Economics (source)

Think about that for a second.
Why are we so patriotic, so eager to go in and fight the war on terror, if this terrorism we speak of is homegrown? Are there people in power who are actually sacrificing human lives while dishing out lies and propaganda to the masses to cover up the atrocities they are committing? What is really going on here? Does the government really have any control, do they even know what is going on?

There exists a shadowy government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of the national interest, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself.

Sometimes certain truths can be hard to swallow, especially if they conflict with your belief systems. In this day and age, new information is constantly emerging that is forcing people to question their beliefs, and admittedly, it is not easy.
But it is always in the best interests of ourselves and society at large to keep an open mind and consider alternative perspectives.
It seems clear that things haven't changed, so what can we do about it? It starts with becoming aware of the things happening around the world which do not resonate with you, and then talking about them.
Do not be afraid to voice your opinion...
The change that needs to take place is a shift in consciousness; from that place we can take the necessary action steps to create a human experience that resonates with all life on this planet, and part of this shift in consciousness includes global transparency.
So ask yourself,
What is really happening on this planet, and why is it happening? What can we do to change it? How often do we look at information like this without ever contemplating the consciousness aspect of it?
What is really happening on this planet, and why is it happening?
What can we do to change it?
How often do we look at information like this without ever contemplating the consciousness aspect of it?
If we want change, we have to look at ourselves and within ourselves.
We cannot keep looking to others for solutions. We have, every one of us, the power to impact the world in a positive way.
Things are looking really good right now, we've come so far with regards to our knowledge about various events that are created by the same ones who propose the solution.
More and more people simply desire a human experience where all live can thrive. This desire and intention alone has tremendous implications, and there is no doubt we are heading in the right direction, but there is still lots of work to do.
It's time for us to open our hearts, expose the hidden, and start creating a better world, one based on cooperation, love, understanding and sharing...
