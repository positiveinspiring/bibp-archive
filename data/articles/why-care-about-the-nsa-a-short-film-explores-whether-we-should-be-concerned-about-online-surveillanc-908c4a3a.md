Like many Americans and people around the world,
I was deeply disturbed to hear the
revelations of Edward
Snowden about N.S.A. surveillance, which is an affront to the
United States Bill of Rights.
But as a filmmaker who has made a number of
documentaries about technology and online activism, I cant say that
Snowdens revelations came as a surprise. Some concerned citizens have long
understood that powerful digital technologies can be abused to carve away at
civil liberties.
I created this Op-Doc with excerpts from interviews that I filmed for an
ongoing documentary about the programmer and online activist
Aaron Swartz,
who was concerned about surveillance issues long before Mr. Snowdens
disclosures.
This short film addresses the most common
arguments Ive heard from people who are not concerned about online
surveillance, such as:
Im not doing anything wrong, so why should
I care? and We need this to keep us safe.
The Internet has placed all of us firmly in a
new and insecure world.
Simultaneously, a
perpetual war on terror
has
infused within that world a culture of fear and anxiety, along with
surveillance policies that will have long-lasting implications.
Now is the
moment for a course correction, where civil liberties are written not just
into our laws but also into our computer code.
Edward Snowden has ignited a debate, and for that I am grateful. But now
that hes done his part, its time for all Americans to decide how to
respond to his revelations.
That is to say, it is no longer his story. It is
ours...
