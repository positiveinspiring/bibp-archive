APPENDIX 6.1
Copy of purported Trilateral Commission's Communique to President Marcos
Page 1
The following 12 images were scanned from the appendix of a book published in 1998 in Makati City, Philippines entitled Marcos Legacy Revisited subtitled: Raiders of the Lost Gold, by Erick A. San Juan. A text version of the letter is available HERE
Thanks are due to to "Dirk" for scanning and providing these images (Redcat says hello, Dirk) and for transcribing the contents of the letter.
Naturally, the veracity of the letter cannot be established with any certainty. However, it is interesting, I think, that this document corresponds precisely with the Marcos letter that Bob Curtis now holds and which he communicated parts to this writer.
