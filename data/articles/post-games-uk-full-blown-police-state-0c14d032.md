London that is widely known as a perfect example of surveillance society
with its
watchful CCTVs, is now a perfect example of
a police state after the massive Olympics militarization, a fact even
organizers implicitly acknowledge.
Organizers decided earlier this year to dress the official mascot for the
2012 Olympics in London, where the security and surveillance cordon are
nicknamed the Ring of Steel, in a Metropolitan police outfit.
The mascots, Wenlock and Mandeville, feature a huge single eye that is
actually a camera lens that organizers said can record everything.
The dolls effectively create an explicit symbol of the pervasive
surveillance state and suggest an unwelcome addition to British social life
that is now subject to an even more intrusive surveillance system thanks to
the biggest and most expensive British security operation in decades for the
Olympics.
The irony has been taken up by critics of the Games.
Water cannon and steel cordon sold
separately. Baton rounds may be unsuitable for small children. A more
perfect visual metaphor for 2012, I cannot imagine, Games Monitor
mocked.
One can only appreciate what the Olympic mascots
have been ironically symbolizing when a few figures on the military
deployment during the Olympics are taken into consideration.
The British government deployed more than three times as many regular troops
as former US president
George W. Bush administration did in 2002 for the
Winter Olympics at Salt Lake City, which began only six months after
the
9/11 incidents and four months after the US invaded Afghanistan.
A total 41,000 troops, police officers, private
security staff, etc were deployed in London.
There also comes a long list of equipment on the ground and in the air:
-
a Navy aircraft carrier HMS Bulwark and
the forces largest warship HMS Ocean will watch the city
-
Typhoon fighter jets
-
Apache Helicopters
-
eagle-eyed surveillance drones and E-3
Sentinel spy planes will swarm the skies
-
radars and surface-to-air missiles will
scan the skies while an 18km, 5,000-volt electrified security
barrier partitions off the Olympic zone
The police state was further intensified by a de
facto suspension of civil liberties.
Public protests were banned - and remain so - during the Games in exclusion
zones near key locations and protesters face police with enhanced powers
including the right to use force to enter private properties, seize
political posters and prevent the display of any material that challenges
the image of London as a clean city, which advertising sponsors including
McDonalds and
Coca-Cola kept promoting.
Security measures also included,
And is that all set to be removed now that the
Games have ended?
The answer is no as there are speculations that the government is using the
opportunity to impose limitations on the British social life that would be
otherwise impossible thanks to civil rights campaigners.
The idea for the continuation of the draconian measures would be that
Britain faces threats from terrorists lurked inside its own cities and
increasingly bigger surveillance would be needed to predict and contain such
threats.
Here, victims would be the ethnic minorities and in particular Muslims.
The police did announce in May 2011 that 290 CCTV cameras formerly installed
in the Muslim areas of Birmingham will be back online for the Games and
there is no end visible to the extra surveillance.
What is more is that Olympic hosts have been unwilling to shelve the
security measures taken up for the Games as the example of Greeces
high-tech surveillance cameras showed back in 2004.
After all, dissent is not desirable especially in the surveillance society
of Britain and police began preparing London for the Games by predicting
crimes early before the Games.
Back in July, officers reportedly arrested several graffiti artists in
pre-emptive raids, which serves as a good example of the state intrusion
into legal private activities of individuals in the police state the
Olympics have helped intensify.
After media reports of 30 arrests, police claimed they arrested only four
people for illegal wall paintings.
However, one of the detainees Darren Cullen turned out to be a known
graffiti businessmen whose company Graffiti Kings has carried out graffiti
projects for big names including Microsoft, Olympic sponsor Adidas and even
for Team GB.
In a separate incident in Cardiff in July, police faced human rights
campaigners call not to turn the city into a police state after a
WalesOnline journalist was stopped and searched outside their headquarters.
The concerned journalist said he was shaken up by the police behavior and
their violation of their guidelines.
Working in the city centre, it feels like
this place is turning into a police state, he added.
That was echoed by anti-surveillance campaigners
Privacy International.
Olympics shouldnt be an excuse to turn
Britain into a police state, it said.
