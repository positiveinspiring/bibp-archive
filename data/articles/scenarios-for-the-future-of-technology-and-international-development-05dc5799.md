There is little
doubt that technology will continue to drive change
across the developing world.
However,
uncertainty exists about the role of technological
advances in alleviating poverty. To uncover the range of
possibilities that may emerge, novel approaches like
scenario planning are essential.
"Scenarios for the Future of Technology and
International Development," a new report, features four
very different - yet very plausible - visions of how
technology could profoundly alter how we address some of
the most pressing challenges in the developing world.
Scenario planning - an innovative method of creating
narratives about the future - is a powerful tool for
assisting organizations in considering how complex
problems could evolve and be solved over the long term.
The scenario
planning process helps to identify unique opportunities,
rehearse important decisions by simulating their broader
implications, and illuminate previously unexplored areas
of intersection.

Letter from Judith
Rodin
President of the Rockefeller Foundation
The Rockefeller Foundation supports work
that expands opportunity and strengthens resilience to social, economic,
health, and environmental challenges - affirming its pioneering
philanthropic mission, since 1913, to "promote the well-being" of
humanity.
We take a synergistic, strategic approach
that places a high value on innovative processes and encourages new ways
of seeking ideas, to break down silos and encourage interdisciplinary
thinking.
One important - and novel - component of our strategy toolkit is
scenario planning, a process of creating narratives about the future
based on factors likely to affect a particular set of challenges and
opportunities.
We believe that scenario planning has great potential for
use in philanthropy to identify unique interventions, simulate and
rehearse important decisions that could have profound implications, and
highlight previously undiscovered areas of connection and intersection.
Most important, by providing a
methodological structure that helps us focus on what we don't know -
instead of what we already know - scenario planning allows us to achieve
impact more effectively.
The results of our first scenario planning exercise demonstrate a
provocative and engaging exploration of the role of technology and the
future of globalization, as you will see in the following pages. This
report is crucial reading for anyone interested in creatively
considering the multiple, divergent ways in which our world could
evolve.
The sparks of insight inspiring these
narratives - along with their implications for philanthropy as a whole -
were generated through the invaluable collaboration of grantee
representatives, external experts, and Rockefeller Foundation staff.
I
offer a special thanks to Peter Schwartz, Andrew Blau, and the entire
team at Global Business Network, who have helped guide us through this
stimulating and energizing process.
Leading this effort at the Rockefeller Foundation is our Research Unit,
which analyzes emerging risks and opportunities and thinks imaginatively
about how to respond to the complex, rapidly changing world around us.
This outward-looking intelligence function adopts a cross-cutting
mindset that synthesizes and integrates knowledge that accelerates our
ability to act more quickly and effectively.
It has also helped to shape and build the
notion of "pro-poor foresight" that is committed to applying
forward-looking tools and techniques to improve the lives of poor and
vulnerable populations around the world.
I hope this publication makes clear exactly why my colleagues and I are
so excited about the promise of using scenario planning to develop
robust strategies and offer a refreshing viewpoint on the possibilities
that lie ahead.
We welcome your feedback.

Letter from Peter Schwartz
Cofounder and Chairman of Global Business Network
We are at a moment in history that is full
of opportunity.
Technology is poised to transform the lives
of millions of people throughout the world, especially those who have
had little or no access to the tools that can deliver sustainable
improvements for their families and communities.
From farmers using
mobile phones to buy and sell crops to doctors remotely monitoring and
treating influenza outbreaks in rural villages, technology is rapidly
becoming more and more integral to the pace and progress of development.
Philanthropy has a unique and critical role to play in this process. By
focusing its patience, capital, and attention on the links between
technology and international development, philanthropy will change not
just lives but the very context in which the field of philanthropy
operates.
This report represents an initial step in that direction.
It explores four very different - yet very
possible - scenarios for the future of technology and development in
order to illuminate the challenges and opportunities that may lie ahead.
It promotes a deeper understanding of the complex forces and dynamics
that will accelerate or inhibit the use of technology to spur growth,
opportunity, and resilience especially in the developing world.
Finally, it will seed a new strategic
conversation among the key public, private, and philanthropic
stakeholders about technology and development at the policy, program,
and human levels.
The Rockefeller Foundation's use of scenario planning to explore
technology and international development has been both inspired and
ambitious. Throughout my 40-plus-year career as a scenario planner, I
have worked with many of the world's leading companies, governments,
foundations, and nonprofits - and I know firsthand the power of the
approach.
Scenario planning is a powerful tool
precisely because the future is unpredictable and shaped by many
interacting variables. Scenarios enable us to think creatively and
rigorously about the different ways these forces may interact, while
forcing us to challenge our own assumptions about what we believe or
hope the future will be.
Scenarios embrace and weave together
multiple perspectives and provide an ongoing framework for spotting and
making sense of important changes as they emerge. Perhaps most
importantly, scenarios give us a new, shared language that deepens our
conversations about the future and how we can help to shape it.
The Rockefeller Foundation has already used this project as an
opportunity to clarify and advance the relationship between technology
and development.
Through interviews and the scenario
workshops, they have engaged a diverse set of people - from different
geographies, disciplines, and sectors - to identify the key forces
driving change, to explore the most critical uncertainties, and to
develop challenging yet plausible scenarios and implications.
They have stretched their thinking far
beyond theoretical models of technology innovation and diffusion in
order to imagine how technology could actually change the lives of
people from many walks of life. This is only the start of an important
conversation that will continue to shape the potential of technology and
international development going forward.
I look forward to staying a part of that
conversation and to the better future it will bring.

Introduction
For decades, technology has been dramatically changing not just the lives of
individuals in developed countries, but increasingly the lives and
livelihoods of people throughout the developing world.
Whether it is a community mobile phone, a solar
panel, a new farming practice, or a cutting-edge medical device, technology
is altering the landscape of possibility in places where possibilities used
to be scarce. And yet looking out to the future, there is no single story to
be told about how technology will continue to help shape - or even
revolutionize - life in developing countries.
There are many possibilities, some good and some
less so, some known and some unknowable.
Indeed, for everything we think we
can anticipate about how technology and international development will
interact and intertwine in the next 20 years and beyond, there is so much
more that we cannot yet even imagine.
For philanthropies as well as for other organizations, this presents a
unique challenge.
Given the uncertainty about,
How the future will play out,
how can we best position ourselves not just to identify technologies that
improve the lives of poor communities but also to help scale and spread
those that emerge?
And how will the social, technological, economic,
environmental, and political conditions of the future enable or inhibit our
ability to do so?
The Rockefeller Foundation believes that in order to understand the many
ways in which technology will impact international development in the
future, we must first broaden and deepen our individual and collective
understanding of the range of possibilities.
This report, and the project upon which it is
based, is one attempt to do that. In it, we share the outputs and insights
from a year-long project, undertaken by the Rockefeller Foundation and
Global Business Network (GBN), designed to explore the role of technology in
international development through scenario planning, a methodology in which
GBN is a long-time leader.
This report builds on the Rockefeller Foundation's growing body of work in
the emerging field of pro-poor foresight.
In 2009, the Institute for
Alternative Futures published the report Foresight for
Smart Globalization - Accelerating and Enhancing Pro-Poor
Development Opportunities, with support from the Rockefeller Foundation.
That effort was a reflection of the Foundation's
strong commitment to exploring innovative processes and embracing new
pathways for insight aimed at helping the world's poor.
With this report, the Foundation takes a further
step in advancing the field of pro-poor foresight, this time through the
lens of scenario planning.
WHY SCENARIOS?
The goal of this project was not to
affirm what is already known and knowable about what is happening right
now at the intersections of technology and development.
Rather, it was to explore the many ways in
which technology and development could co-evolve - could both push and
inhibit each other - in the future, and then to begin to examine what
those possible alternative paths may imply for the world's poor and
vulnerable populations.
Such an exercise required project
participants to push their thinking far beyond the status quo, into
uncharted territory.
Scenario planning is a methodology designed to help guide groups and
individuals through exactly this creative process. The process begins by
identifying forces of change in the world, then combining those forces
in different ways to create a set of diverse stories - or scenarios -
about how the future could evolve.
Scenarios are designed to stretch our
thinking about both the opportunities and obstacles that the future
might hold; they explore, through narrative, events and dynamics that
might alter, inhibit, or enhance current trends, often in surprising
ways.
Together, a set of scenarios captures a range of future
possibilities, good and bad, expected and surprising - but always
plausible. Importantly, scenarios are not predictions.
Rather, they are thoughtful hypotheses that
allow us to imagine, and then to rehearse, different strategies for how
to be more prepared for the future - or more ambitiously, how to help
shape better futures ourselves.
WHY TECHNOLOGY?
Technology was chosen as a focal
point of this project because of its potentially transformative role -
both in a positive and negative way - in addressing a wide range of
development challenges, from climate change, healthcare, and agriculture
to housing, transportation, and education.
Yet while there is little doubt that
technology will continue to be a driver of change across the developing
world in the future, the precise trajectory along which technological
innovation will travel is highly uncertain.
For example, will critical technological
advances come from the developed world, or will innovators and their
innovations be more geographically dispersed? Or, how might the global
economic and political environment affect the pace of technology
development?
It is important to state that in focusing on technology, this project
did not set out to identify a set of exact, yet-to-be-invented
technologies that will help shape and change the future.
Rather, the
goal was to gain a broader and richer understanding of different paths
along which technology could develop - paths that will be strongly
influenced by the overall global environment in which the inventors and
adopters of those technologies will find themselves working and
dwelling.
Technology, as a category, cannot be
divorced from the context in which it develops. The scenarios shared in
this report explore four such contexts, each of which, as you'll see,
suggests very different landscapes for technology and its potential
impacts in the developing world.
Finally, a note about what we mean by "technology." In this report, we
use the term to refer to a broad spectrum of tools and methods of
organization.
Technologies can range from tools for basic
survival, such as a treadle pump and basic filtration technologies, to
more advanced innovations, such as methods of collecting and utilizing
data in health informatics and novel building materials with real-time
environmental sensing capabilities.
This report focuses on themes
associated with the widespread scalability, adoption, and assessment of
technology in the developing world.
While the scenarios themselves are
narratives about the global environment, we have paid particular
attention to how events might transpire in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast
Asia, and India.
THE FOCAL QUESTION
Every scenario project has a focal question - a broad yet
strategic query that serves as an anchor for the scenarios.
For this project, the focal question was:
How might technology affect barriers to
building resilience and equitable growth in the developing world
over the next 15 to 20 years?
In other words, what new or existing
technologies could be leveraged to improve the capacity of individuals,
communities, and systems to respond to major changes, or what
technologies could improve the lives of vulnerable populations around
the world?
A 15- to 20-year timeframe was chosen on the
assumption that it is both sufficiently long enough that significant
technological change is plausible and sufficiently short enough that we
can imagine some possibilities for the kinds of technologies that could
be developed and applied.
Focusing on how to overcome a set of
obstacles associated with the application of technology to the
challenges of development helped to both bound the inquiry and promote a
problem-solving approach that seeks to identify potential, systematic
intervention opportunities.
A Note on Terminology
The Foundation's work promotes "resilience and equitable growth."
Resilience refers to the capacity of individuals, communities, and
systems to survive, adapt, and grow in the face of changes, even
catastrophic incidents. Equitable growth involves enabling individuals,
communities, and institutions to access new tools, practices, resources,
services, and products.
ENGAGING YOUR IMAGINATION
It is our hope that these scenarios help inspire the same
future-orientation in other initiatives that are broadly concerned with
technology and international development.
Of course, there is no hard data about the
future - nobody yet knows precisely what technologies will be successful
at addressing new and evolving development needs.
Rather, as you read
the scenarios, think of them as a journey - four journeys - into a
future that is relevant, thought-provoking, and possible. Imagine how
the world will function and how it will be organized to tackle the
challenges it faces.
Who will be responsible for driving local
and global development initiatives and what would that require? And what
is your own role in leading your organization, community, or region to a
preferred future?
Scenarios are a medium through which great change can be not just
envisioned but also actualized.
The more closely you read them, the more
likely it becomes that you will recognize their important but less
obvious implications to you, your work, and your community. We strongly
encourage you to share and discuss this report widely, use it as a
springboard for further creative thinking about how technology could
shape development, and test and adjust your strategies or personal
actions accordingly.
It is also our hope that these scenarios help to identify potential
areas of future work for governments, philanthropies, corporations, and
nonprofits, and that they illuminate choices and commitments that a wide
range of organizations may want to make in these areas in the future.

The Scenario Framework
The Rockefeller Foundation and GBN began the scenario process by surfacing a
host of driving forces that would affect the future of technology and
international development.
These forces were generated through both
secondary research and in-depth interviews with Foundation staff, Foundation
grantees, and external experts. Next, all these constituents came together
in several exploratory workshops to further brainstorm the content of these
forces, which could be divided into two categories: predetermined elements
and critical uncertainties.
A good starting point for any set of scenarios
is to understand those driving forces that we can be reasonably certain will
shape the worlds we are describing, also known as "predetermined elements."
For example, it is a near geopolitical certainty
that - with the rise of China, India, and other nations - a multi-polar
global system is emerging.
One demographic certainty is that global
population growth will continue and will put pressure on energy, food, and
water resources - especially in the developing world. Another related
certainty: that the world will strive to source more of its energy from
renewable resources and may succeed, but there will likely still be a
significant level of global interdependence on energy.
Predetermined elements are important to any scenario story, but they are not
the foundation on which these stories are built.
Rather, scenarios are formed around
"critical
uncertainties" - driving forces that are considered both highly important to
the focal issue and highly uncertain in terms of their future resolution.
Whereas predetermined elements are predictable driving forces, uncertainties
are by their nature unpredictable: their outcome can be guessed at but not
known.
While any single uncertainty could challenge our thinking, the future will
be shaped by multiple forces playing out over time.
The scenario framework provides a structured way
to consider how these critical uncertainties might unfold and evolve in
combination.
Identifying the two most important uncertainties guarantees
that the resulting scenarios will differ in ways that have been judged to be
critical to the focal question.
CHOOSING THE CRITICAL UNCERTAINTIES
During this project's scenario creation workshop, participants - who
represented a range of regional and international perspectives -
selected the two critical uncertainties that would form the basis of the
scenario framework.
They chose these two uncertainties from a
longer list of potential uncertainties that might shape the broader
contextual environment of the scenarios, including social, technology,
economic, environmental, and political trends.
The uncertainties that were considered
included, for example,
-
the pervasiveness of conflict in the
developing world
-
the frequency and severity of shocks
like economic and political crises, disease, and natural
disasters
-
the locus of innovation for crucial
technologies for development.
(A full list of the critical uncertainties
identified during the project, as well as a list of project
participants, can be found in the Appendix.)
The two chosen uncertainties, introduced below, together define a set of
four scenarios for the future of technology and international
development that are divergent, challenging, internally consistent, and
plausible.
Each of the two uncertainties is expressed
as an axis that represents a continuum of possibilities ranging between
two endpoints.
GLOBAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ALIGNMENT
This uncertainty refers to both the amount of economic integration - the
flow of goods, capital, people, and ideas - as well as the extent to
which enduring and effective political structures enable the world to
deal with many of the global challenges it faces.
On one end of the axis, we would see a more
integrated global economy with high trade volumes, which enables access
to a wider range of goods and services through imports and exports, and
the increasing specialization of exports.
We would also see more cooperation at the
supra-national level, fostering increased collaboration, strengthened
global institutions, and the formation of effective international
problem-solving networks.
At the other axis endpoint, the potential
for economic development in the developing world would be reduced by the
fragility of the overall global economy - coupled with protectionism and
fragmentation of trade - along with a weakening of governance regimes
that raise barriers to cooperation, thereby hindering agreement on and
implementation of large-scale, interconnected solutions to pressing
global challenges.
ADAPTIVE CAPACITY
This uncertainty refers to the capacity at different levels of society
to cope with change and to adapt effectively.
This ability to adapt can mean proactively
managing existing systems and structures to ensure their resilience
against external forces, as well as the ability to transform those
systems and structures when a changed context means they are no longer
suitable.
Adaptive capacity is generally associated
with higher levels of education in a society, as well as the
availability of outlets for those who have educations to further their
individual and societal well-being.
High levels of adaptive capacity are
typically achieved through,
-
the existence of trust in society
-
the presence and tolerance of
novelty and diversity
-
the strength, variety, and overlap
of human institutions
-
the free flow of communication and
ideas, especially between and across different levels, e.g.,
bottom-up and top-down.
Lower levels of adaptive capacity emerge in
the absence of these characteristics and leave populations particularly
vulnerable to the disruptive effects of unanticipated shocks.
Once crossed, these axes create a matrix of four very different futures:
-
LOCK STEP A world of tighter
top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership,
with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback
-
CLEVER TOGETHER A world in
which highly coordinated and successful strategies emerge for
addressing both urgent and entrenched worldwide issues
-
HACK ATTACK An economically
unstable and shock-prone world in which governments weaken,
criminals thrive, and dangerous innovations emerge
-
SMART SCRAMBLE An
economically depressed world in which individuals and
communities develop localized, makeshift solutions to a growing
set of problems
THE SCENARIO NARRATIVES
The scenarios that follow are not meant to be exhaustive - rather, they
are designed to be both plausible and provocative, to engage your
imagination while also raising new questions for you about what that
future might look and feel like.
Each scenario tells a story of how the
world, and in particular the developing world, might progress over the
next 15 to 20 years, with an emphasis on those elements relating to the
use of different technologies and the interaction of these technologies
with the lives of the poor and vulnerable.
Accompanying each scenario is a range of
elements that aspire to further illuminate life, technology, and
philanthropy in that world.
These include:
-
A timeline of possible headlines and
emblematic events unfolding during the period of the scenario
-
Short descriptions of what
technologies and technology trends we might see
-
Initial observations on the changing
role of philanthropy in that world, highlighting opportunities
and challenges that philanthropic organizations would face and
what their operating environment might be like
-
A "day in the life" sketch of a
person living and working in that world
Please keep in mind that the scenarios in
this report are stories, not forecasts, and the plausibility of a
scenario does not hinge on the occurrence of any particular detail.
In
the scenario titled "Clever Together," for example, "a consortium of
nations, NGOs [non-governmental organizations], and companies establish
the Global Technology Assessment Office" - a detail meant to symbolize
how a high degree of international coordination and adaptation might
lead to the formation of a body that anticipates technology's potential
societal implications.
That detail, along with dozens of others in
each scenario, is there to give you a more tangible "feel" for the world
described in the scenario.
Please consider names, dates, and other such
specifics in each scenario as proxies for types of events, not as
necessary conditions for any particular scenario to unfold.
We now invite you to immerse yourself in each future world and consider
four different visions for the evolution of technology and international
development to 2030.
In
2012, the pandemic that the world had been
anticipating for years finally hit.
Unlike
2009's H1N1, this new influenza strain -
originating from wild geese - was extremely virulent and deadly.
Even the most pandemic-prepared nations were
quickly overwhelmed when the virus streaked around the world, infecting
nearly 20 percent of the global population and killing 8 million in just
seven months, the majority of them healthy young adults.
The pandemic also
had a deadly effect on economies:
international mobility of both people and
goods screeched to a halt, debilitating industries like tourism and breaking
global supply chains.
Even locally, normally bustling shops and office
buildings sat empty for months, devoid of both employees and customers.
The pandemic blanketed the planet - though disproportionate numbers died in
Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America, where the virus spread like
wildfire in the absence of official containment protocols. But even in
developed countries, containment was a challenge.
The United States' initial policy of
"strongly
discouraging" citizens from flying proved deadly in its leniency,
accelerating the spread of the virus not just within the U.S. but across
borders.
However, a few countries did fare better -
China
in particular.
The Chinese government's quick imposition and
enforcement of mandatory quarantine for all citizens, as well as its
instant and near-hermetic sealing off of all borders, saved millions of
lives, stopping the spread of the virus far earlier than in other countries
and enabling a swifter post- pandemic recovery.
China's government was not the only one that took extreme measures to
protect its citizens from risk and exposure. During the pandemic, national
leaders around the world flexed their authority and imposed airtight rules
and restrictions, from the mandatory wearing of face masks to
body-temperature checks at the entries to communal spaces like train
stations and supermarkets.
Even after the pandemic faded, this more
authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck
and even intensified. In order to protect themselves from the spread of
increasingly global problems - from pandemics and transnational terrorism to
environmental crises and rising poverty - leaders around the world took a
firmer grip on power.
At first, the notion of a more controlled world gained wide acceptance and
approval.
Citizens willingly gave up some of their
sovereignty - and their privacy - to more paternalistic states in exchange
for greater safety and stability. Citizens were more tolerant, and even
eager, for top-down direction and oversight, and national leaders had more
latitude to impose order in the ways they saw fit.
In developed countries, this heightened
oversight took many forms:
biometric IDs for all citizens, for example,
and tighter regulation of key industries whose stability was deemed
vital to national interests.
In many developed countries, enforced
cooperation with a suite of new regulations and agreements slowly but
steadily restored both order and, importantly, economic growth.
Across the developing world, however, the story was different - and much
more variable.
Top-down authority took different forms in
different countries, hinging largely on the capacity, caliber, and
intentions of their leaders. In countries with strong and thoughtful
leaders, citizens' overall economic status and quality of life increased. In
India, for example, air quality drastically improved after 2016, when the
government outlawed high-emitting vehicles.
In Ghana, the introduction of ambitious
government programs to improve basic infrastructure and ensure the
availability of clean water for all her people led to a sharp decline in
water-borne diseases.
But more authoritarian leadership worked less well -
and in some cases tragically - in countries run by irresponsible elites who
used their increased power to pursue their own interests at the expense of
their citizens.
There were other downsides, as the rise of virulent nationalism created new
hazards: spectators at the 2018 World Cup, for example, wore
bulletproof vests that sported a patch of their national flag. Strong
technology regulations stifled innovation, kept costs high, and curbed
adoption.
In the developing world, access to
"approved"
technologies increased but beyond that remained limited:
the locus of technology innovation was
largely in the developed world, leaving many developing countries on the
receiving end of technologies that others consider "best" for them.
Some governments found this patronizing and
refused to distribute computers and other technologies that they scoffed at
as "second hand." Meanwhile, developing countries with more resources and
better capacity began to innovate internally to fill these gaps on their
own.
Meanwhile, in the developed world, the presence of so many top-down rules
and norms greatly inhibited entrepreneurial activity.
Scientists and innovators were often told by
governments what research lines to pursue and were guided mostly toward
projects that would make money (e.g., market-driven product development) or
were "sure bets" (e.g., fundamental research), leaving more risky or
innovative research areas largely untapped.
Well-off countries and monopolistic companies
with big research and development budgets still made significant advances,
but the IP behind their breakthroughs remained locked behind strict national
or corporate protection.
Russia and India imposed stringent domestic
standards for supervising and certifying encryption-related products and
their suppliers - a category that in reality meant all IT innovations.
The U.S. and EU struck back with retaliatory
national standards, throwing a wrench in the development and diffusion of
technology globally.
"IT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL SOME
SOCIETIES FOR SOME TIME,
BUT NOT THE WHOLE WORLD
ALL THE TIME."
GK Bhat, TARU
Leading Edge, India
Especially in the developing world, acting in
one's national self-interest often meant seeking practical alliances that
fit with those interests - whether it was gaining access to needed resources
or banding together in order to achieve economic growth.
In South America and Africa, regional and
sub-regional alliances became more structured.
Kenya doubled its trade with southern and
eastern Africa, as new partnerships grew within the continent. China's
investment in Africa expanded as the bargain of new jobs and infrastructure
in exchange for access to key minerals or food exports proved agreeable to
many governments. Cross-border ties proliferated in the form of official
security aid.
While the deployment of foreign security teams
was welcomed in some of the most dire failed states, one-size-fits-all
solutions yielded few positive results.
By 2025, people seemed to be growing weary of so much top-down control
and letting leaders and authorities make choices for them. Wherever national
interests clashed with individual interests, there was conflict.
Sporadic pushback became increasingly organized
and coordinated, as disaffected youth and people who had seen their status
and opportunities slip away - largely in developing countries - incited
civil unrest. In 2026, protestors in Nigeria brought down the government,
fed up with the entrenched cronyism and corruption.
Even those who liked the greater stability and
predictability of this world began to grow uncomfortable and constrained by
so many tight rules and by the strictness of national boundaries.
The feeling lingered that sooner or later,
something would inevitably upset the neat order that the world's governments
had worked so hard to establish.
ROLE OF PHILANTHROPY IN LOCK STEP
Philanthropic organizations will face hard choices in this world.
Given the strong role of governments, doing
philanthropy will require heightened diplomacy skills and the ability to
operate effectively in extremely divergent environments. Philanthropy
grantee and civil society relationships will be strongly moderated by
government, and some foundations might choose to align themselves more
closely with national official development assistance (ODA)
strategies and government objectives.
Larger philanthropies will retain an outsized
share of influence, and many smaller philanthropies may find value in
merging financial, human, and operational resources.
Philanthropic organizations interested in promoting universal rights and
freedoms will get blocked at many nations' borders. Developing smart,
flexible, and wide-ranging relationships in this world will be key; some
philanthropies may choose to work only in places where their skills and
services don't meet resistance.
Many governments will place severe restrictions
on the program areas and geographies that international philanthropies can
work in, leading to a narrower and stronger geographic focus or grant-making
in their home country only.
TECHNOLOGY IN LOCK STEP
While there is no way of accurately predicting
what the important technological advancements will be in the future, the
scenario narratives point to areas where conditions may enable or accelerate
the development of certain kinds of technologies.
Thus for each scenario we offer a sense of the
context for technological innovation, taking into consideration the pace,
geography, and key creators. We also suggest a few technology trends and
applications that could flourish in each scenario.
Technological innovation in "Lock Step" is largely driven by government and
is focused on issues of national security and health and safety.
Most technological improvements are created by
and for developed countries, shaped by governments' dual desire to control
and to monitor their citizens. In states with poor governance, large-scale
projects that fail to progress abound.
Technology trends and applications we might see:
-
Scanners using advanced functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology become the norm at
airports and other public areas to detect abnormal behavior that may
indicate "antisocial intent."
-
In the aftermath of pandemic scares,
smarter packaging for food and beverages is applied first by big
companies and producers in a business-to-business environment, and
then adopted for individual products and consumers.
-
New diagnostics are developed to detect
communicable diseases. The application of health screening also
changes; screening becomes a prerequisite for release from a
hospital or prison, successfully slowing the spread of many
diseases.
-
Tele-presence technologies respond to
the demand for less expensive, lower-bandwidth, sophisticated

Driven by protectionism and national

varying degrees of success in policing Internet traffic, but these
efforts nevertheless fracture the "World Wide" Web.
LIFE IN LOCK STEP
Manisha gazed out on the Ganges River,
mesmerized by what she saw.
Back in 2010, when she was 12 years old, her
parents had brought her to this river so that she could bathe in its holy
waters. But standing at the edge, Manisha had been afraid. It wasn't the
depth of the river or its currents that had scared her, but the water
itself: it was murky and brown and smelled pungently of trash and dead
things.
Manisha had balked, but her mother had pushed
her forward, shouting that this river flowed from the lotus feet of Vishnu
and she should be honored to enter it. Along with millions of Hindus, her
mother believed the Ganges's water could cleanse a person's soul of all sins
and even cure the sick.
So Manisha had grudgingly dunked herself in the
river, accidentally swallowing water in the process and receiving a bad case
of giardia, and months of diarrhea, as a result.
Remembering that experience is what made today so remarkable.
It was now 2025. Manisha was 27 years old and a
manager for the Indian government's Ganges Purification Initiative (GPI).
Until recently, the Ganges was still one of the most polluted rivers in the
world, its coliform bacteria levels astronomical due to the frequent
disposal of human and animal corpses and of sewage (back in 2010, 89 million
liters per day) directly into the river.
Dozens of organized attempts to clean the Ganges
over the years had failed. In 2009, the World Bank even loaned India $1
billion to support the government's multi-billion dollar cleanup initiative.
But then the pandemic hit, and that funding dried up.
But what didn't dry up was the government's
commitment to cleaning the Ganges - now not just an issue of public health
but increasingly one of national pride.
Manisha had joined the GPI in 2020, in part because she was so impressed by
the government's strong stance on restoring the ecological health of India's
most treasured resource.
Many lives in her home city of Jaipur had been
saved by the government's quarantines during the pandemic, and that
experience, thought Manisha, had given the government the confidence to be
so strict about river usage now:
how else could they get millions of Indian
citizens to completely shift their cultural practices in relationship to a
holy site?
Discarding ritually burned bodies in the Ganges
was now illegal, punishable by years of jail time. Companies found to be
dumping waste of any kind in the river were immediately shut down by the
government.
There were also severe restrictions on where
people could bathe and where they could wash clothing. Every 20 meters along
the river was marked by a sign outlining the repercussions of "disrespecting
India's most treasured natural resource." Of course, not everyone liked it;
protests flared every so often. But no one could deny that the Ganges was
looking more beautiful and healthier than ever.
Manisha watched as an engineering team began unloading equipment on the
banks. Many top Indian scientists and engineers had been recruited by the
government to develop tools and strategies for cleaning the Ganges in more
high-tech ways.
Her favorite were the submersible bots that
continuously "swam" the river to detect, through sensors, the presence of
chemical pathogens.
New riverside filtration systems that sucked in
dirty river water and spit out far cleaner water were also impressive -
especially because on the outside they were designed to look like
mini-temples.
In fact, that's why Manisha was at the river today, to oversee
the installation of a filtration system located not even 100 feet from where
she first stepped into the Ganges as a girl. The water looked so much
cleaner now, and recent tests suggested that it might even meet drinkability
standards by 2035.
Manisha was tempted to kick off her shoe and dip
her toe in, but this was a restricted area now - and she, of all people,
would never break that law.
The recession of 2008-10 did not turn into the
decades-long global economic slide that many had feared.
In fact, quite the
opposite: strong global growth returned in force, with the world headed once
again toward the demographic and economic projections forecasted before the
downturn.
India and China were on track to see their middle classes explode
to 1 billion by 2020.
Mega-cities like Sao Paulo and Jakarta expanded
at a blistering pace as millions poured in from rural areas. Countries raced
to industrialize by whatever means necessary; the global marketplace
bustled.
But two big problems loomed.
-
First, not all people and places
benefited equally from this return to globalized growth: all boats
were rising, but some were clearly rising more.
-
Second, those hell-bent on development
and expansion largely ignored the very real environmental
consequences of their unrestricted growth.
Undeniably, the planet's climate was becoming
increasingly unstable.
Sea levels were rising fast, even as countries
continued to build-out coastal mega-cities.
In 2014, the Hudson River overflowed into New
York City during a storm surge, turning the World Trade Center site into a
three-foot-deep lake. The image of motorboats navigating through lower
Manhattan jarred the world's most powerful nations into realizing that
climate change was not just a developing-world problem.
That same year, new measurements showing that
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were climbing precipitously created new
urgency and pressure for governments (really, for everyone) to do something
fast.
In such an interconnected world, where the behaviors of one country,
company, or individual had potentially high-impact effects on all others,
piecemeal attempts by one nation here, one small collective of environmental
organizations there, would not be enough to stave off a climate disaster -
or, for that matter, to effectively address a host of other planetary-scale
problems.
But highly coordinated worldwide strategies for
addressing such urgent issues just might. What was needed was systems
thinking - and systems acting - on a global scale.
International coordination started slowly, then accelerated faster than
anyone had imagined.
In 2015, a critical mass of middle income and
developed countries with strong economic growth publicly committed to
leveraging their resources against global-scale problems, beginning with
climate change. Together, their governments hashed out plans for monitoring
and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the short term and improving the
absorptive capacity of the natural environment over the long term.
In 2017, an international agreement was reached
on carbon sequestration (by then, most multinational corporations had a
chief carbon officer) and intellectual and financial resources were pooled
to build out carbon capture processes that would best support the global
ecosystem. A functioning global cap and trade system was also established.
Worldwide, the pressure to reduce waste and
increase efficiency in planet-friendly ways was enormous.
New globally coordinated systems for monitoring
energy use capacity - including smart grids and bottom-up pattern
recognition technologies - were rolled out. These efforts produced real
results: by 2022, new projections showed a significant slowing in the rise
of atmospheric carbon levels.
Inspired by the success of this experiment in collective global action,
large-scale coordinated initiatives intensified. Centralized global
oversight and governance structures sprang up, not just for energy use but
also for disease and technology standards. Such systems and structures
required far greater levels of transparency, which in turn required more
tech-enabled data collection, processing, and feedback.
Enormous, benign "surveillance" systems allowed
citizens to access data - all publicly available - in real time and react.
Nation-states lost some of their power and importance as global architecture
strengthened and regional governance structures emerged. International
oversight entities like the UN took on new levels of authority, as did
regional systems like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD),
and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
The worldwide spirit of collaboration also
fostered new alliances and alignments among corporations, NGOs, and
communities.
These strong alliances laid the groundwork for more global and participatory
attempts to solve big problems and raise the standard of living of everyone.
Coordinated efforts to tackle long-entrenched problems like hunger, disease,
and access to basic needs took hold. New inexpensive technologies like
better medical diagnostics and more effective vaccines improved healthcare
delivery and health outcomes.
Companies, NGOs, and governments - often acting
together - launched pilot programs and learning labs to figure out how to
best meet the needs of particular communities, increasing the knowledge base
of what worked and what didn't.
Pharmaceuticals giants released thousands of
drug compounds shown to be effective against diseases like malaria into the
public domain as part of an "open innovation" agenda; they also opened their
archives of R&D on neglected diseases deemed not commercially viable,
offering seed funding to scientists who wanted to carry the research
forward.
There was a push for major innovations in energy and water for the
developing world, as those areas were thought to be the key to improving
equity.
Better food distribution was also high on the
agenda, and more open markets and south-south trade helped make this a
reality. In 2022, a consortium of nations, NGOs, and companies established
the Global Technology Assessment Office, providing easily accessible,
real-time information about the costs and benefits of various technology
applications to developing and developed countries alike.
All of these efforts translated into real
progress on real problems, opening up new opportunities to address the needs
of the bottom billion - and enabling developing countries to become engines
of growth in their own right.
In many parts of the developing world, economic growth rates increased due
to a host of factors.
Improved infrastructure accelerated the greater
mobility of both people and goods, and urban and rural areas got better
connected. In Africa, growth that started on the coasts spread inward along
new transportation corridors. Increased trade drove the specialization of
individual firms and the overall diversification of economies.
In many places, traditional social barriers to
overcoming poverty grew less relevant as more people gained access to a
spectrum of useful technologies - from disposable computers to
do-it-yourself (DIY) windmills.
"WHAT IS OFTEN SURPRISING ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGIES
IS COLLATERAL DAMAGE:
THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM THAT YOU CAN CREATE
BY SOLVING ANOTHER
PROBLEM IS ALWAYS A BIT OF A SURPRISE."
Michael Free
Program for Appropriate Technology in
Health (PATH)
Given the circumstances that forced these new
heights of global cooperation and responsibility, it was no surprise that
much of the growth in the developing world was achieved more cleanly and
more "greenly."
In Africa, there was a big push for solar
energy, as the physical geography and low population density of much of the
continent enabled the proliferation of solar farms.
The
Desertec initiative to create massive
thermal electricity plants to supply both North Africa and, via undersea
cable lines, Southern Europe was a huge success. By 2025, a majority of
electricity in the Maghreb was coming from solar, with exports of that power
earning valuable foreign currency.
The switch to solar created new "sun" jobs,
drastically cut CO2 emissions, and earned governments billions
annually. India exploited its geography to create similar "solar valleys"
while decentralized solar-powered drip irrigation systems became popular in
sub-Saharan Africa.
Reduced energy dependency enabled all of these countries and regions to
better control and manage their own resources. In Africa, political
architecture above the nation-state level, like the African Union,
strengthened and contributed to a "good governance" drive.
Regional
integration through
COMESA (the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa) and other institutions allowed member nations to better
organize to meet their collective needs as consumers and increasingly as
producers.
Over the course of two decades, enormous strides were made to make the world
less wasteful, more efficient, and more inclusive.
But the world was far from perfect. There were
still failed states and places with few resources.
Moreover, such rapid progress had created new
problems. Rising consumption standards unexpectedly ushered in a new set of
pressures: the improved food distribution system, for example, generated a
food production crisis due to greater demand. Indeed, demand for everything
was growing exponentially.
By 2028, despite ongoing efforts to guide
"smart
growth," it was becoming clear that the world could not support such rapid
growth forever.
ROLE OF PHILANTHROPY IN CLEVER TOGETHER
In this world, philanthropic organizations focus their attention on the
needs of the bottom billion, collaborating with governments, businesses, and
local NGOs to improve standards of living around the globe.
Operationally, this is a "virtual model" world
in which philanthropies use all of the tools at their disposal to reinforce
and bolster their work. With partnerships and networks increasingly key,
philanthropies work in a more virtual way, characterized by lots of wikis,
blogs, workspaces, video conferences, and virtual convenings.
Smaller philanthropies proliferate, with a
growing number of major donors emerging from the developing world.
Systems thinking and knowledge management prove to be critical skills, as
philanthropic organizations seek to share and spread best practices,
identify leapfrog opportunities, and better spot problems in failed or weak
states.
There are considerable flows of talent between
the for-profit and nonprofit sectors, and the lines between these types of
organizations become increasingly blurred.
TECHNOLOGY IN CLEVER TOGETHER
In "Clever Together," strong global cooperation on a range of issues drives
technological breakthroughs that combat disease, climate change, and energy
shortages.
Trade and foreign direct investment spread
technologies in all directions and make products cheaper for people in the
developing world, thereby widening access to a range of technologies.
The
atmosphere of cooperation and transparency allows states and regions to
glean insights from massive datasets to vastly improve the management and
allocation of financial and environmental resources.
Technology trends and applications we might see:
-
The cost of capturing data through
nanosensors and smart networks falls precipitously. In many
developing countries, this leads to a proliferation of new and
useful services, including "sousveillance" mechanisms that improve
governance and enable more efficient use of government resources.
-
Intelligent electricity, water
distribution, and transportation systems develop in urban areas. In
these "smart cities," Internet access is seen as a basic right by
the late 2010s.
-
A malaria vaccine is developed and
deployed broadly - saving millions of lives in the developing world.
-
Advances in low-cost mind-controlled
prosthetics aid the 80 percent of global amputees who live in
developing countries.
-
Solar power is made vastly more
efficient through advances in materials, including polymers and
nanoparticles. An effective combination of government subsidies and
microfinance means solar is used for everything from desalination
for agriculture to wi-fi networks.
-
Flexible and rapid mobile payment
systems drive dynamic economic growth in the developing world, while
the developed world is hampered by entrenched banking interests and
regulation.
LIFE IN CLEVER TOGETHER
Standing next to his desk at the World Meat Science Lab in Zurich,
Alec took another bite of the steak that his lab assistants had just
presented to him and chewed it rather thoughtfully.
This wasn't just any steak. It was research.
Alec and his research team had been working for months to fabricate a new
meat product - one that tasted just like beef yet actually contained only 50
percent meat; the remaining half was a combination of synthetic meat,
fortified grains, and nano-flavoring. Finding the "right" formula for that
combo had kept the lab's employees working around the clock in recent weeks.
And judging from the look on Alec's face, their
work wasn't over.
"The flavor is still a few degrees off," he
told them. "And Kofi and Alana - see what we can do about enhancing this
texture."
As Alec watched his team scramble back to their
lab benches, he felt confident that it wouldn't be long before they would
announce the invention of an exciting new meat product that would be served
at dinner tables everywhere.
And, in truth, Alec's confidence was very well
founded. For one, he had the world's best and brightest minds in food
science from all over the world working together right here in his lab.
He also had access to seemingly infinite amounts
of data and information on everything from global taste preferences to meat
distribution patterns - and just a few touches on his lab's research screens
(so much easier than the clunky computers and keyboards of the old days)
gave him instant access to every piece of research ever done in meat science
or related fields from the 1800s up through the present (literally the
present - access to posted scientific research was nearly instantaneous,
delayed by a mere 1.3 seconds).
Alec also had strong motivation. There was no doubt that meat science
- indeed, all science - was much more exciting, challenging, and rewarding
in 2023 than it was a few decades ago. The shift from "lone wolf" science to
globally coordinated and open-platform research had greatly accelerated the
speed and spread of breakthrough ideas and developments in all fields.
As a result, scientists were making real
progress in addressing planet-wide problems that had previously seemed so
intractable: people were no longer dying as frequently from preventable
diseases, for example, and alternative fuels were now mainstream.
But other trends were troubling - especially to a scientist who had spent
his whole career researching food. In cities and villages around the world
where children used to be hungry, access to higher-calorie meals had
produced alarming increases in the incidence of obesity and diabetes.
The
demand for meat, in particular, was rising, but adding more animals to the
planet created its own set of problems, such as more methane and spiking
water demand.
And that's where Alec saw both need and
opportunity: why not make the planet's meat supply go further by creating a
healthier alternative that contained less real meat?
"Alec, we have a new version for you to
try," yelled Kofi from across the lab.
That was fast, thought Alec, as he searched
around his desk for the fork.
Devastating shocks like
September 11, the
Southeast Asian tsunami of 2004, and the 2010 Haiti earthquake had certainly
primed the world for sudden disasters.
But no one was prepared for a world
in which large-scale catastrophes would occur with such breathtaking
frequency.
The years 2010 to 2020 were
dubbed the "doom
decade" for good reason:
the 2012 Olympic bombing, which killed
13,000, was followed closely by an earthquake in Indonesia killing
40,000, a tsunami that almost wiped out Nicaragua, and the onset of the
West China Famine, caused by a once-in-a-millennium drought linked to
climate change.
Not surprisingly, this opening series of deadly
asynchronous catastrophes (there were more) put enormous pressure on an
already overstressed global economy that had entered the decade still in
recession.
Massive humanitarian relief efforts cost vast sums of money, but
the primary sources - from aid agencies to developed-world governments - had
run out of funds to offer.
Most nation-states could no longer afford their
locked-in costs, let alone respond to increased citizen demands for more
security, more healthcare coverage, more social programs and services, and
more infrastructure repair.
In 2014, when mudslides in Lima buried
thousands, only minimal help trickled in, prompting the Economist headline:
"Is the Planet Finally
Bankrupt?"
These dire circumstances forced tough tradeoffs.
In 2015, the U.S. reallocated a large share of
its defense spending to domestic concerns, pulling out of Afghanistan -
where the resurgent Taliban seized power once again. In Europe, Asia, South
America, and Africa, more and more nation-states lost control of their
public finances, along with the capacity to help their citizens and retain
stability and order.
Resource scarcities and trade disputes, together
with severe economic and climate stresses, pushed many alliances and
partnerships to the breaking point; they also sparked proxy wars and
low-level conflict in resource-rich parts of the developing world.
Nations
raised trade barriers in order to protect their domestic sectors against
imports and - in the face of global food and resource shortages - to reduce
exports of agricultural produce and other commodities.
By 2016, the global coordination and
interconnectedness that had marked the post-Berlin Wall world was tenuous at
best. With government power weakened, order rapidly disintegrating, and
safety nets evaporating, violence and crime grew more rampant.
Countries with ethnic, religious, or class
divisions saw especially sharp spikes in hostility:
-
Naxalite separatists dramatically
expanded their guerrilla campaign in East India
-
Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed escalated
-
across Africa, fights over resources
erupted along ethnic or tribal lines
Meanwhile, overtaxed militaries and police
forces could do little to stop growing communities of criminals and
terrorists from gaining power.
Technology-enabled gangs and networked criminal
enterprises exploited both the weakness of states and the desperation of
individuals. With increasing ease, these "global guerillas" moved illicit
products through underground channels from poor producer countries to
markets in the developed world.
Using retired 727s and other rogue aircraft,
they crisscrossed the Atlantic, from South America to Africa, transporting
cocaine, weapons, and operatives.
Drug and gun money became a common recruiting
tool for the desperately poor. Criminal networks also grew highly skilled at
counterfeiting licit goods through reverse engineering. Many of these
"rip-offs" and copycats were of poor quality or downright dangerous.
In the context of weak health systems,
corruption, and inattention to standards - either within countries or from
global bodies like the World Health Organization - tainted vaccines
entered the public health systems of several African countries.
In 2021, 600 children in Cote d'Ivoire died from
a bogus Hepatitis B vaccine, which paled in comparison to the scandal
sparked by mass deaths from a tainted anti-malarial drug years later.
The deaths and resulting scandals sharply
affected public confidence in vaccine delivery; parents not just in Africa
but elsewhere began to avoid vaccinating their children, and it wasn't long
before infant and child mortality rates rose to levels not seen since the
1970s.
Technology hackers were also hard at work. Internet scams and pyramid
schemes plagued inboxes. Meanwhile, more sophisticated hackers attempted to
take down corporations, government systems, and banks via phishing scams and
database information heists, and their many successes generated billions of
dollars in losses.
Desperate to protect themselves and their
intellectual property, the few multinationals still thriving enacted strong,
increasingly complex defensive measures. Patent applications skyrocketed and
patent thickets proliferated, as companies fought to claim and control even
the tiniest innovations.
Security measures and screenings tightened.
This "wild west" environment had a profound impact on innovation. The threat
of being hacked and the presence of so many thefts and fakes lowered the
incentives to create "me first" rather than "me too" technologies. And so
many patent thickets made the cross-pollination of ideas and research
difficult at best.
Blockbuster pharmaceuticals quickly became
artifacts of the past, replaced by increased production of generics.
Breakthrough innovations still happened in various industries, but they were
focused more on technologies that could not be easily replicated or
re-engineered.
And once created, they were vigorously guarded
by their inventors - or even by their nations.
In 2022, a biofuel breakthrough in Brazil was
protected as a national treasure and used as a bargaining chip in trade with
other countries.
"WE HAVE THIS LOVE AFFAIR WITH STRONG CENTRAL
STATES,
BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY.
TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO MAKE THIS EVEN MORE REAL
FOR AFRICA.
THERE IS THE SAME CELLPHONE PENETRATION RATE IN
SOMALIA AS IN RWANDA.
IN THAT RESPECT, SOMALIA
WORKS."

Verifying the authenticity of anything was
increasingly difficult.
The heroic efforts of several companies and NGOs to
create recognized seals of safety and approval proved ineffective when even
those seals were hacked.
The positive effects of the mobile and Internet
revolutions were tempered by their increasing fragility as scamming and
viruses proliferated, preventing these networks from achieving the
reliability required to become the backbone of developing economies - or a
source of trustworthy information for anybody.
Interestingly, not all of the "hacking" was bad.
Genetically modified crops (GMOs) and
do-it-yourself (DIY) biotech became backyard and garage activities,
producing important advances. In 2017, a network of renegade African
scientists who had returned to their home countries after working in Western
multinationals unveiled the first of a range of new GMOs that boosted
agricultural productivity on the continent.
But despite such efforts, the global have/have-not gap grew wider than ever.
The very rich still had the financial means to protect themselves; gated
communities sprung up from New York to Lagos, providing safe havens
surrounded by slums. In 2025, it was de rigueur to build not a house but a
high-walled fortress, guarded by armed personnel.
The wealthy also capitalized on the loose
regulatory environment to experiment with advanced medical treatments and
other under-the-radar activities.
Those who couldn't buy their way out of chaos - which was most people -
retreated to whatever "safety" they could find. With opportunity frozen and
global mobility at a near standstill - no place wanted more people,
especially more poor people - it was often a retreat to the familiar: family
ties, religious beliefs, or even national allegiance.
Trust was afforded to those who guaranteed
safety and survival - whether it was a warlord, an evangelical preacher, or
a mother. In some places, the collapse of state capacity led to a resurgence
of feudalism.
In other areas, people managed to create more
resilient communities operating as isolated micro versions of formerly
large-scale systems. The weakening of national governments also enabled
grassroots movements to form and grow, creating rays of hope amid the
bleakness.
By 2030, the distinction between
"developed" and "developing" nations no longer seemed particularly descriptive or relevant.
ROLE OF PHILANTHROPY IN HACK ATTACK
Philanthropy is less about affecting change than about promoting stability
and addressing basic survival needs.
Philanthropic organizations move to support
urgent humanitarian efforts at the grassroots level, doing "guerrilla
philanthropy" by identifying the "hackers" and innovators who are catalysts
of change in local settings.
Yet identifying pro-social entrepreneurs is a
challenge, because verification is difficult amid so much scamming and
deception.
The operational model in this world is a "fortress model" in which
philanthropic organizations coalesce into a strong, single unit to combat
fraud and lack of trust. Philanthropies' biggest assets are their
reputation, brand, and legal/financial capacity to ward off threats and
attempts at destabilization.
They also pursue a less global approach,
retreating to doing work in their home countries or a few countries that
they know well and perceive as being safe.
TECHNOLOGY IN HACK ATTACK
Mounting obstacles to market access and to knowledge creation and sharing
slow the pace of technological innovation.
Creative repurposing of existing technologies -
for good and bad - is widespread, as counterfeiting and IP theft lower
incentives for original innovation. In a world of trade disputes and
resource scarcities, much effort focuses on finding replacements for what is
no longer available.
Pervasive insecurity means that tools of aggression and
protection - virtual as well as corporeal - are in high demand, as are
technologies that will allow hedonistic escapes from the stresses of life.
Technology trends and applications we might see:
-
Echoing the rise of synthetic chemicals
in the nineteenth century, synthetic biology, often state-funded, is
used to "grow" resources and foodstuffs that have become scarce.
-
New threats like weaponized biological
pathogens and destructive botnets dominate public attention, but
enduring technologies, like the AK-47, also remain weapons of choice
for global guerrillas.
-
The Internet is overrun with spam and
security threats and becomes strongly associated with illicit
activity - especially on "dark webs" where no government can
monitor, identify, or restrict activities.
-
Identity-verification technologies
become a staple of daily life, with some hitches - a database of
retina recordings stolen by hackers in 2017 is used to create
numerous false identities still "at large" in the mid-2020s.
-
With the cost of cosmetic surgery
dropping, procedures like the lunchtime facelift become routine
among emerging middle classes.
LIFE IN HACK ATTACK
Trent never thought that his past experience as a government intelligence
officer would convert into something
philanthropic.
But in a world full of deceit and scamming, his
skills at discerning fact from fiction and developing quick yet deep local
knowledge were highly prized. For three months now he had been working for a
development organization, hired to find out what was happening in the "grey"
areas in Botswana - a country that was once praised for its good governance
but whose laws and institutions had begun to falter in the last few years,
with corruption on the rise.
His instructions were simple: focus not on the
dysfunctional (which, Trent could see, was everywhere) but rather look
through the chaos to see what was actually working. Find local innovations
and practices that were smart and good and might be adopted or implemented
elsewhere.
"Guerrilla philanthropy" was what they called
it, a turn of phrase that he liked quite a bit.
His trip into Botswana had been eventful - to put it mildly. On-time flights
were rare these days, and the plane got diverted three times because of
landing authorization snafus.
At the Gaborone airport, it took Trent six hours
to clear customs and immigration. The airport was bereft of personnel, and
those on duty took their time scrutinizing and re-scrutinizing his visa.
Botswana had none of the high-tech biometric scanning checkpoints -
technology that could literally see right through you - that most developed
nations had in abundance in their airports, along their borders, and in
government buildings.
Once out of the airport Trent was shocked by how
many guns he saw - not just slung on the shoulders of police, but carried by
regular people. He even saw a mother with a baby in one arm and an AK-47 in
the other. This wasn't the Botswana he remembered way back when he was
stationed here 20 years ago as an embassy employee.
The organization that hired him was probably more right than it realized in
calling it guerrilla philanthropy. After many weeks spent chasing
down leads in Gaborone, then an unfortunate stint that had him hiking for
miles alone through the Kalahari Desert, Trent found himself traveling deep
into the Chobe Forest (a nice reprieve, he thought, from inhaling all that
sand).
One of his informants had told him about a group
of smart youngsters who had set up their own biotechnology lab on the banks
of the Chobe River, which ran along the forest's northern boundary. He'd
been outfitted with ample funds for grant-making, not the forest bribes he
had heard so much about; regardless of what was taking place in the world
around him, he was under strict orders to behave ethically.
Trent was also careful to cover his tracks to
avoid being kidnapped by international crime syndicates - including the
Russian mafia and the Chinese triads - that had become very active and
influential in Botswana. But he'd made it through, finally, to the lab,
which he later learned was under the protection of the local gun lord.
As expected, counterfeit vaccines were being
manufactured. But so were GMO seeds. And synthetic proteins.
And a host of other innovations that the people
who hired him would love to know about.
The
global recession that started in 2008 did not trail off in 2010
but dragged onward.
Vigorous attempts to jumpstart markets and
economies didn't work, or at least not fast enough to reverse the steady
downward pull. The combined private and public debt burden hanging over the
developed world continued to depress economic activity, both there and in
developing countries with economies dependent on exporting to (formerly)
rich markets.
Without the ability to boost economic activity,
many countries saw their debts deepen and civil unrest and crime rates
climb. The United States, too, lost much of its presence and credibility on
the international stage due to deepening debt, debilitated markets, and a
distracted government. This, in turn, led to the fracturing or decoupling of
many international collaborations started by or reliant on the U.S.'s
continued strength.
Also in trouble was China, where social stability grew more precarious.
Depressed economic activity, combined with the
ecological consequences of China's rapid growth, started to take their toll,
causing the shaky balance that had held since 1989 to finally break down.
With their focus trained on managing the serious political and economic
instability at home, the Chinese sharply curtailed their investments in
Africa and other parts of the developing world. Indeed, nearly all foreign
investment in Africa - as well as formal, institutional flows of aid and
other support for the poorest countries - was cut back except in the gravest
humanitarian emergencies.
Overall, economic stability felt so shaky that
the occurrence of a sudden climate shock or other disaster would likely send
the world into a tailspin. Luckily, those big shocks didn't occur, though
there was a lingering concern that they could in the future.
Not that anyone had time to think about the future - present challenges were
too pressing. In the developed world, unemployment rates skyrocketed. So did
xenophobia, as companies and industries gave the few available jobs to
native-born citizens, shunning foreign-born applicants.
Great numbers of immigrants who had resettled in
the developed world suddenly found that the economic opportunities that had
drawn them were now paltry at best. By 2018, London had been drained of
immigrants, as they headed back to their home countries, taking their
education and skills with them.
Reverse migration left holes in the communities
of departure - both socially and literally - as stores formerly owned by
immigrants stood empty. And their homelands needed them.
Across the developing world and especially in
Africa, economic survival was now firmly in local hands. With little help or
aid coming through "official" and organized channels - and in the absence of
strong trade and foreign currency earnings - most people and communities had
no choice but to help themselves and, increasingly, one another.
Yet "survival" and "success" varied greatly by location - not just by country,
but by city and by community.
Communities inside failed states suffered the
most, their poor growing still poorer. In many places, the failures of
political leadership and the stresses of economic weakness and social
conflict stifled the ability of people to rise above their dire
circumstances.
Not surprisingly, across much of the developing world the rural-urban divide
gaped wider, as more limited availability and access to resources like IT
and trade made survival and self-sufficiency much more challenging for
non-urban dwellers.
Communications and interactions that formerly
served to bridge one family or one village or one student with their
counterparts in other places - from emailing to phone calls to web postings
- became less reliable. Internet access had not progressed far beyond its
2010 status, in part because the investment dollars needed to build out the
necessary infrastructure simply weren't there.
When cellphone towers or fiber optic cables
broke down, repairs were often delayed by months or even years. As a result,
only people in certain geographies had access to the latest communication
and Internet gadgets, while others became more isolated for lack of such
connections.
But there were silver linings.
Government capacity improved in more advanced
parts of the developing world where economies had already begun to generate
a self-sustaining dynamic before the 2008-2010 crisis, such as Indonesia,
Rwanda, Turkey, and Vietnam. Areas with good access to natural resources,
diverse skill sets, and a stronger set of overlapping institutions did far
better than others; so did cities and communities where large numbers of
"returnees" helped drive change and improvement.
Most innovation in these better-off places
involved modifying existing devices and technologies to be more adaptive to
a specific context.
But people also found or invented new ways -
technological and non-technological - to improve their capacity to survive
and, in some cases, to raise their overall living standards. In Accra, a
returning Ghanaian MIT professor, working with resettled pharma researchers,
helped invent a cheap edible vaccine against tuberculosis that dramatically
reduced childhood mortality across the continent.
In Nairobi, returnees launched a local
"vocational education for all" project that proved wildly successful and was
soon replicated in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa.
"THE SPREADING OF IDEAS DEPENDS ON ACCESS TO
COMMUNICATION, PEER GROUPS, AND COMMUNITIES OF
PRACTICE.
EVEN IF SOMEONE HAS BLUEPRINTS TO MAKE
SOMETHING,
THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE MATERIALS OR KNOW-HOW.
IN A WORLD SUCH AS THIS,
HOW DO YOU CREATE AN
ECOSYSTEM OF RESEARCH AMONG THESE COMMUNITIES?"
Jose Gomez-Marquez
Program Director for the Innovations in
International Health initiative (IIH), MIT
Makeshift, "good enough" technology solutions -
addressing everything from water purification and harnessing energy to
improved crop yield and disease control - emerged to fill the gaps.
Communities grew tighter. Micro-manufacturing,
communal gardens, and patchwork energy grids were created at the local level
for local purposes.
Many communities took on the aura of co-ops, some even
launching currencies designed to boost local trade and bring communities
closer together. Nowhere was this more true than in India, where localized
experiments proliferated, and succeeded or failed, with little connection to
or impact on other parts of the country - or the world.
These developments were encouraging, but also frustrating. In the absence of
enduring trade and FDI channels, local experiments and innovations could
neither scale nor boost overall growth.
For those looking, it was difficult to find or
access creative solutions. Scaling was further inhibited by the lack of
compatible technology standards, making innovations difficult to replicate.
Apps developed in rural China simply didn't work in urban India.
High-speed Internet access - which gradually emerged in some areas despite
weak government or philanthropic support - did help, enabling students in
isolated pockets in the developing world to access knowledge and instruction
through the written word and other media like video.
But the development of
tangible devices, products, and innovations continued to lag in places where
local manufacturing skills and capacities had not yet scaled. More complex
engineering solutions proved even more difficult to develop and diffuse.
By 2025, collaboration was finally improving, with ecosystems of research
and sharing - many of them "virtual" - beginning to emerge.
Yet without major progress in global economic
integration and collaboration, many worried that good ideas would stay
isolated, and survival and success would remain a local - not a global or
national - phenomenon.
ROLE OF PHILANTHROPY IN SMART SCRAMBLE
Philanthropic organizations look to fund at the grassroots level, in order
to reach people more quickly and solve short-term problems.
The meta-goal in this world is to scale up:
to identify and build capacity from the
individual through the institutional, because without global
coordination, innovation cannot scale on its own.
Philanthropy requires a keen screening capacity
to identify highly localized solutions, with specialized pockets of
expertise that make partnerships more challenging and transitions between
sectors and issues harder to achieve.
Philanthropy operations are decentralized; headquarters are less important,
and the ability to quickly access different parts of the world and
reconfigure teams on short notice is key.
Office space is rented by the day or week, not
the month or year, because more people are in the field - testing,
evaluating, and reporting on myriad pilot projects.
TECHNOLOGY IN SMART SCRAMBLE
Economic and political instability fracture societies in the developed
world, resources for technology development diminish, and talented
immigrants are forced to return to their countries of origin.
As a result, capacity and knowledge are
distributed more widely, allowing many small pockets of do-it-yourself
innovation to emerge. Low-tech, "good enough" solutions abound, cobbled
together with whatever materials and designs can be found. However, the
transfer of cutting-edge technology through foreign direct investment is
rare.
Structural deficiencies in the broader
innovation ecosystem - in accessing capital, markets, and a stable Internet
- and in the proliferation of local standards limit wider growth and
development.
Technology trends and applications we might see:
-
Energy technology improvements are
geared more toward efficiency - getting more from existing sources
of power - than new-generation technologies, though some local
improvements in generating and distributing wind and geothermal
energy do occur.
-
Breakdowns in the global medicine supply
chain accelerate the emergence of locally bioengineered
super-strength homeopathic remedies, which replace antibiotics in
the dispensaries of many developing-world hospitals.
-
Widespread micro-manufacturing, using 3D
printers, enables the fabrication of replacement components for
engines and machines, allowing "perpetual maintenance" to compensate
for broken trade links.
-
Garden allotments proliferate in
mega-cities as new urban-dwellers seek to supplement a scarce food
supply and maintain their agricultural heritage.
-
Technically advanced communities use
mesh networks to ensure high-speed Internet access, but most
rural poor remain cut off from access.
LIFE IN SMART SCRAMBLE
The beat-up six-seater plane in which Lidi was the lone passenger lurched
suddenly.
She groaned, grabbed the armrests, and held on
as the plane dipped sharply before finally settling into a smooth flight
path. Lidi hated small planes. But with very few commercial jets
crisscrossing Africa these days, she didn't have much choice.
Lidi - an Eritrean by birth - was a social
entrepreneur on a mission that she deemed critical to the future of her home
continent, and enduring these plane flights was an unfortunate but necessary
sacrifice. Working together with a small team of technologists, Lidi's goal
was to help the good ideas and innovations that were emerging across Africa
to spread faster - or, really, spread at all.
In this, Lidi had her work cut out for her. Accelerating and scaling the
impact of local solutions developed for very local markets was far from easy
- especially given the patchiness of Internet access across Africa and the
myopic perspective that was now, in 2025, a widespread phenomenon.
She used to worry about how to scale good ideas
from continent to continent; these days she'd consider it a great success to
extend them 20 miles. And the creative redundancy was shocking! Just last
week, in Mali, Lidi had spent time with a farmer whose co-op was developing
a drought-resistant cassava.
They were extremely proud of their efforts, and
for good reason. Lidi didn't have the heart to tell them that, while their
work was indeed brilliant, it had already been done. Several times, in
several different places.
During her many flights, Lidi had spent hours looking out the window, gazing
down on the villages and cities below.
She wished there were an easier way to let the
innovators in those places know that they might not be inventing, but rather
independently reinventing, tools, goods, processes, and practices that were
already in use. What Africa lacked wasn't great ideas and talent: both were
abundant. The missing piece was finding a way to connect those dots.
And that's why she was back on this rickety
plane again and heading to Tunisia.
She and her team were now concentrating on
promoting mesh networks across Africa, so that places lacking Internet
access could share nodes, get connected, and maybe even share and scale
their best innovations.

Concluding Thoughts
We hope that reading the scenario narratives and their accompanying stories
about philanthropy, technology, and people has sparked your imagination,
provoking new thinking about these emergent themes and their possibilities.
Three key insights stood out to us as we
developed these scenarios.
First, the link between technology and governance is critical to consider in
better understanding how technology could be developed and deployed.
In some
futures, the primacy of the nation-state as a unit of analysis in
development was questioned as both supra- or sub-national structures proved
more salient to the achievement of development goals.
In other futures, the
nation-state's power strengthened and it became an even more powerful actor
both to the benefit and to the detriment of the development process,
depending on the quality of governance.
Technologies will affect governance, and
governance in turn will play a major role in determining what technologies
are developed and who those technologies are intended, and able, to benefit.
A second recurring theme in the scenarios is that development work will
require different levels of intervention, possibly simultaneously.
In some scenarios, philanthropic organizations
and other actors in development face a set of obstacles in working with
large institutions, but may face a yet-unfolding set of opportunities to
work with nontraditional partners - even individuals.
The organization that is able to navigate
between these levels and actors may be best positioned to drive success.
DEVELOPMENT-LED INTERVENTIONS ARE OFTEN NOT
CAREFUL ENOUGH
ABOUT WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY NEEDS IN ORDER TO WORK
ON A THREE, FIVE, OR SEVEN YEAR CYCLE.
WHAT SCALE IS REQUIRED FOR DEPLOYMENT TO BE
SUCCESSFUL?
WHAT LEVEL OF EDUCATION IS NEEDED TO BE
SUSTAINABLE IN TERMS OF MAINTENANCE?
HOW DO THESE REQUIREMENTS EVOLVE OVER TIME?
Isha Ray

California-Berkeley School of Information

The third theme highlights the potential value
of scenarios as one critical element of strategy development.
These narratives have served to kick-start the
idea generation process, build the future-oriented mindset of participants,
and provide a guide for ongoing trend monitoring and horizon scanning
activities. They also offer a useful framework that can help in tracking and
making sense of early indicators and milestones that might signal the way in
which the world is actually transforming.
While these four scenarios vary significantly from one another, one theme is
common to them all: new innovations and uses of technology will be an active
and integral part of the international development story going forward.
The changing nature of technologies could shape
the characteristics of development and the kinds of development aid that are
in demand. In a future in which technologies are effectively adopted and
adapted by poor people on a broad scale, expectations about the provision of
services could fundamentally shift.
Developing a deeper understanding of the ways in
which technology can impact development will better prepare everyone for the
future, and help all of us drive it in new and positive directions.

Appendix
CRITICAL UNCERTAINTIES
The following is a list of the 15 critical uncertainties presented to
participants during this project's primary scenario creation workshop.
These uncertainties were themselves selected
from a significantly longer list generated during earlier phases of research
and extensive interviewing. The uncertainties fall into three categories:
technological, social and environmental, and economic and political.
Each uncertainty is presented along with two
polar endpoints, both representing a very different direction in which that
uncertainty might develop.
LIST OF PARTICIPANTS
