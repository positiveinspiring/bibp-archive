In order to understand what is really going on around the globe in terms of the collapsing economy, we must set aside false mainstream versions of reality.
When it comes to the EU and its current fiscal turmoil, it is very important to, in some respects, ignore Greece entirely.
That's right; forget about all the supposed drama surrounding Greek debt obligations.
Will they find a way to pay creditors? Will they default? Will they make a deal with Russia and the BRICS? Will there be last-minute concessions to save the system?
Will they find a way to pay creditors?
Will they default?
Will they make a deal with Russia and the BRICS?
Will there be last-minute concessions to save the system?
It doesn't matter. It's all a soap opera, an elaborate Kabuki theater run by international financiers and globalists.
It is most important to remember the fundamentals:
Greece will default on its debts. Period. There is no way around it.
Maybe Greece makes a deal today, maybe it makes a deal tomorrow; but eventually, the country's ability to stretch out its resources in order to meet its exponential liabilities will end.
It is inevitable, and no last-minute "deal" is going to change the math at the core of it all.
Why are so many economists so worried about a little country like Greece?
It's all due to a great lie:
a dishonest narrative being perpetuated by the establishment that if Greece falls, defaults or leaves the EU, this could trigger a domino effect of other nations hitting a debt wall and following suit.
The lie embedded in this narrative is the claim that Greece will cause a "contagion" through the act of default.
Let's be clear - there is no contagion. Multiple countries within the EU have developed their own debt problems in spite of Greece over the past couple of decades, not because of Greece.
Each of these countries, from Italy, to Spain, to Portugal, etc. has its OWN sovereign debt disasters to deal with caused by its own fiscal irresponsibility. The only legitimate reason for a so-called contagion is the fact that these countries have been forced into socialist interdependency through the EU structure.
Never forget this:
The EU is in trouble not because of Greece, but because of forced supranational interdependency.
The EU by all rights should not exist, nor should any centralized supranational single currency system.
I would also point out that globalist institutions like the International Monetary Fund are highly motivated to initiate disaster in the EU, despite some people's assumptions that the EU is some kind of representative model of globalization. It's not.
If this were the case, then the IMF would not be stiffing Greece on debt aid while continuing to help Ukraine despite Ukraine's similar inability to pay.
Why would the globalists want a partial breakup of the EU? What would they gain from such an event?
Why would the globalists want a partial breakup of the EU?
What would they gain from such an event?
That's easy:
they gain crisis, chaos and an opportunity to present a false dialectic.
Europe is not at all representative of what globalists really want in terms of economic and political structure, no matter what many people assume.
It is a, rather, a kind of facsimile; a half measure. When Europe hits the bottom of the financial abyss and the bewildered public begins asking what the hell happened, the elites will be there with an immediate explanation.
They will claim that it was not the EU's interdependency that was the problem. Instead, they will assert that the EU was actually not centralized ENOUGH.
They will claim that in order for a supranational economy and currency to work, we must also have supranational governance. In other words, the system failed because it needs to be stabilized by global government.
The Fabian socialists will argue that it was the barbaric and outdated institution of national sovereignty that caused the full-spectrum crisis.
They will completely gloss over the negative effects of an interdependent economic system and the fact that a lack of redundancy leaves cultures simpering and impotent. We're all one big human village after all, so we should accept the idea that we all succeed or fail together.
Free markets and individual innovation apparently have nothing to do with a thriving economic structure.
What we really need is a hive mind amalgamation that turns us all into easily replaceable parts in a massive rumbling lawnmower that chews up our heritage, history and principles for the sake of some arbitrary greater good and the promise of alchemical floating cities in the sky where no one has to work anymore.
The fall of the EU is a means to an end for globalists.
There is almost no nation or institution they will not sacrifice if that sacrifice can be exploited to further their goal of total global political and economic dominance. They don't just want a completely centralized system; they want all of us to BEG them to put that system in place. They want the masses to think it was all our idea.
This is the most pervasive and effective form of slavery, when the slaves are manipulated into demanding their own enslavement. When the slaves are fooled into believing their enslavement is something to be proud of - a badge of honor in service of the collective, if you will.
The fall of the U.S. will be no different in this regard. We do not necessarily have a supranational structure like the EU. So our narrative for collapse will be slightly different, and the engineered lesson we are meant to learn will be carefully crafted.
You see, Americans are meant to play the role of the spoiled imperialists who are finally getting what we deserve, an economic punch in our tender parts. We are the new Rome, bread and circuses and all.
And when the U.S. comes crashing down like Europe, the Fabians will be there yet again to admonish the greed inherent in national sovereignty and the destructive aspirations of power that must be squelched by a more evenhanded global political system. I don't really know how many people out there realize this, but we are meant to play the bad guys in the global theater being put on by the elites.
Americans are the villains, the rest of the world plays the role of innocent victim, and globalist centers like the IMF and the BIS are meant to play the heroes, coming to the rescue of humanity when all appears lost.
Our debt generation by far outmatches that of the whole of EU nations combined, a fact I outlined in Part 3 of my series One Last Look at The Real Economy Before it Implodes.
Unlike Greece, though, the U.S. has the direct option to print fiat at will in order to prolong punishment for our massive debt spending.
However, as we have seen with recent market reactions to the very notion of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve (FED) in September, such an event will trigger extensive outflows from stock markets and herald the end of the "new normal."
Again, why would the banksters do this? Why not keep interest rates at a constant near zero?
Again, why would the banksters do this?
Why not keep interest rates at a constant near zero?
It is not as if there is any public pressure to raise rates; in fact, it's quite the opposite.
Why is the FED ignoring the hundreds of signals showing that the U.S. is in a recession and pushing ahead with discussion of interest rate hikes despite what one might logically conclude would be in the FED's best interest?
The FED knows that the only things propping up American markets are free money and blind faith by the public that banks and government will act to stop any pain or economic suffering, should such a potential for crisis arise.
When the free money is gone and that faith disappears, then we will have an epic catastrophe on our hands. The globalists within the FED know this, and they want this - at least , they want a controlled version of this.
The elites NEED the fall of the current U.S. system exactly because this will make way for the rise of what they often term the "great economic reset."
This reset is the next stage in the plan for total global economic centralization.
This is not about contagion. There is no such thing. It is an excuse, a scapegoat designed to distract from the real problem. This is about a concerted effort over the past several decades by internationalists to maneuver Western cultures into a position of vulnerability.
When people are weak and frightened, they become malleable.
Social changes you would have never thought possible today become very possible tomorrow in the midst of a crisis. I believe we are now seeing the onset of the next great crisis, and the fundamentals of economy support my view.
When the entire European system hangs by the thread of Greek debt and the entire U.S. system hangs by the thread of near zero interest rates and blind market faith, something is about to shatter.
There is no going back from such a condition. There is only the path forward, and the path forward is not pleasant or comfortable and it cannot be ignored.
We cannot forget that crisis is in itself a distraction as well. Whatever pain we do feel tomorrow, or the next day, or the next decade, remember who it was that caused it all: the international banks and their globalist political counterparts.
No matter what happens, never be willing to accept a centralized system. No matter how reasonable or rational it might sound amid the terror of fiscal uncertainty, never give the beast what it wants. Refuse to conform to the dialectic.
This is the only chance we have left to get back to true prosperity.
Once we cross the line into the realm of worldwide institutionalized interdependency, we will never know prosperity or freedom again...
