# The Last American President

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_obama127.htm

I had a recent conversation with a man who
scoffed at my notion that
Obama
has set himself up to be a dictator on the scale of Adolph Hitler.
This could never happen in America,
the man proclaimed. Congress and the Supreme Court would never let
him get away with it.
Through the unconstitutional power of
Executive Orders (i.e. dictatorial power to issue decrees), Obama
has positioned himself to stand alongside the most heinous dictators in
history.
Since taking office, President
Obama signed 923
Executive Orders in the first 40 months of his term, many times
more than any other president to date.
When one looks at the scope of his
Executive Orders, along with what they entail, it is clear that
Obama is attempting to become the last American President.
Dictatorial Control
Dictatorial Control Over All Fuel,
Transportation

Allows the government to take control
over all modes of transportation, highways, and seaports.

Dictatorial Control Over the Ability to
Completely Enslave the American People
Executive Order 11000
Allows the government to mobilize
civilians into work brigades under government supervision.
Executive Order 11001
Allows the government to take over all
health, education, and welfare functions.
Executive Order 11002
Designates the Postmaster General to
operate national registration of all persons.
Executive Order 11004
Allows the Housing and Finance Authority
to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds,
designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for
populations.
Dictatorial
Control Over the Ability to Grant Self Totalitarian Control Over
Government
Executive Order 11051
Specifies the responsibility of the
Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all
Executive Orders into effect in times of increased international
tensions and economic or financial crisis.
Executive Order 11310
Grants authority to the Department of
Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to
institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative
liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional
institutions, and to advise and assist the President.
Executive Order 11049
Assigns emergency preparedness function
to federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative
Executive Orders issued over a fifteen year period.
Grants Self
Total Dictatorial Control Over Everything
Executive Order 11921
Allows the Federal Emergency
Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the
mechanisms of production and distribution, of energy sources, wages,
salaries, credit and flow of money in the U.S.A. financial
institution in any undefined national emergency. It also provides
that when a state of emergency is declared by the President,
Congress cannot review the action for six months.
Dictatorial Control Over Americans Right to
Defend Themselves Against Tyranny
Obama has created 23 Executive Orders which
deal with gun control.
Yet, the White House has not listed them as
of yet, meaning that the President has not signed them. Clearly, this is
a lever he is holding over Congress to get what he wants with gun
control.
If Congress, does not submit to his desires,
Obama will, no doubt, enact the 23 Executive Orders, thus leaving
American defenseless against the tyranny of the aforementioned
Executive Orders.
Conclusion
When 2016 rolls around, it is becoming clear
that this President will never leave office as he has the ability, under
the aforementioned Executive Orders to decree himself, Ruler for Life.
Under these Executive Orders he has granted
himself to incarcerate those who would oppose him, starve populations
into submission, control all jobs, wages, transportation and control the
message to the people.
He now has the ability to limit the
citizens the right to defend themselves against his tyranny.
And along
with his criminal partners in Congress, under the NDAA, he has the
ability to disappear and even murder suspected political dissidents in
the spirit of Mao, Hitler and Stalin,
-
Who will oppose this tyrannical power grab?
-
The 50% of the Obamanistas who are sustained through federal subsidies?
-
Will he be opposed by those who are brainwashed by the
corporate
controlled media?
Almost a half a million well-to-do people
have left the country in the past year.
What have they figured out that
the rest of us have not?
