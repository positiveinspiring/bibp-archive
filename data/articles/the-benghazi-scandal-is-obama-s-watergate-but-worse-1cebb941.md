A trail of emails released
Tuesday appears to shed yet more light on the Benghazi cover-up story that
continues to nag President
Obama and then Secretary of State and
current Democratic presidential hopeful
Hillary
Clinton.
The latest exposure indicates that both Obama
and Clinton knew that UN Secretary Susan Rice's claim to the press that the
attack on the Benghazi compound killing Libyan Ambassador Christopher
Stevens and three other Americans was due to an anti-Moslem YouTube
video was a complete lie.
This latest piece of incriminating evidence is
what Republicans are now calling their "smoking gun" despite months that
have stretched into years of the Congressional investigation led by
Representative Darrel
Issa (R-CA).
His so called investigation that was supposed to
uncover the truth behind that fateful day of September 11th, 2012
has often been labeled "a witch hunt" by Democrats and supporters of Obama
and Hillary Clinton.
This week's news may be the needed breakthrough
that will ultimately lead to the unveiling of what many critics of the Obama
administration have been claiming all along.
And that is Obama and Hillary purposely withheld
the truth from the American public for fear that it would derail Obama's
reelection less than two months after the death of the four
Americans in Benghazi.
In retrospect now Obama's rush to war in Syria last
September is far better understood when taking a hard look at the 2012
Benghazi embassy attack. The so called Arab spring uprising revolts in
Middle Eastern and North African nations in fact have been the result of
covert manipulation by the CIA.
After getting rid of our one time allies in Iraq's Saddam Hussein and
Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, next on the US regime-change hit list came
Libya's Muammar Gaddafi.
In 2007 retired General
Wesley Clark revealed
a neocon plan he became privy to a couple weeks after 9/11 of the ambitious
Bush administration agenda to
take down seven sovereign governments in the next five years that included,
-
Afghanistan
-
Iraq
-
Sudan
-
Somalia
-
Libya
-
Syria
-
Iran
With gusto President Obama inherited this same
agenda and proceeded to finish the job in removing Libya's longtime dictator
Gaddafi.
And so began the NATO air bombardment of
Libya killing many innocent victims that softened the resistance to an all
out assault on Gaddafi's military forces largely spearheaded by al
Qaeda mercenaries from all over the Middle East as well as native
Libyan al Qaeda affiliated militia groups, some from Benghazi.
In the spring of 2011 even prior to Gaddafi's
capture and killing, as an envoy to the rebel coalition the future Libyan
Ambassador Christopher Stevens was sent to Benghazi,
a city in eastern Libya that has long been a hotbed of Islamic extremism
that includes various Al Qaeda affiliated groups and militias.
Stevens spoke Arabic and had twenty years of
foreign diplomatic service experience when he was selected to become the
Ambassador after the fall of the Gaddafi government.
The State Department resent him to work back in
Benghazi rather than the Libyan capitol Tripoli to assist the area's
transition to the new puppet government the US had installed. But because
Benghazi and eastern Libya had a history of resisting national governance,
Stevens faced an uphill struggle and near impossible task.
Beginning in June of 2012, a full three months
prior to the Benghazi embassy compound attack that killed the Ambassador and
three other Americans, Stevens' requests for increased
security began falling on deaf ears in Washington. Stevens' boss,
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, failed to heed any of his increasingly
urgent calls.
Just days prior to the embassy onslaught, the
British consulate had been attacked and all its diplomatic staff were safely
evacuated away.
Last year efforts to blame Stevens for
irresponsibly turning
down security offered in Benghazi were anonymously leaked,
insisting that the ambassador twice had turned down offers of increased
military security from AFRICOM commander General Ham.
For obvious reasons the now retired general
refuses to discuss what he knew or did not know of the events leading up to
the Benghazi attack.
However, throughout the aftermath of the Americans'
deaths, Stevens' own deputy ambassador Gregory Hicks in Tripoli has
maintained that he never knew of any such alleged offers made to Stevens for
more security.
Since the strategy targeting Ambassador Stevens
as the sole reason for the lack of security at his embassy compound clearly
backfired, a whitewashed report was released last year by the Accountability
Review Board. The two men behind this report are Hillary's
buddies Ambassador Pickering and former Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral
Mullens.
Thus no surprise that they decided from the
outset that it would not be necessary to even bother to interview Hillary,
satisfied to blame it on lower level State Department bureaucrats' error in
judgment not to supply adequate security.
The alleged failure to authorize proper military
security was because the Benghazi compound was relegated to being a
temporary outpost. Of course this is just another feeble attempt to shield
Queen Hillary who sent Stevens herself to Benghazi fully aware of it being
an al Qaeda trouble spot.
But Benghazi under the cover of the State
Department was ideal for the covert CIA and Joint Special Operations
Command (JSOC) needed to coordinate arms smuggling that Obama,
Hillary and then CIA Director Petraeus were knee deep in.
Stevens
ultimately may have felt he was being used as the convenient decoy for the
clandestine activity he wanted no part of.
Years earlier as a former Peace Corps volunteer
and a seasoned career diplomat, becoming a lookout for an immoral criminal
gun running operation may not have been what he had signed on for as the
Libyan Ambassador.
Thus, he very likely voiced his objection to
what his bosses in Washington were misusing him for, and as vindictive and
petty as Obama and Hillary are, Stevens was likely punished for not going
along with their program.
Hence, all his urgent pleas that began as early
as June 2012, a full three months prior to the September attack, requesting
increased security were ignored, including his desperate cry for help
moments before his murder on the night of the 11th.
Meanwhile, as he and
three other Americans lay dying, back in the States Obama was flying out
West to another high brow fundraiser so he could self-servingly get
reelected.
What is most certain is that this trouble spot
region was the hub of activity for special ops units comprised of special
forces and a large number of CIA operatives in conjunction with British MI6.
The CIA safely defended annex in Benghazi a mere
mile and a half from the embassy compound was the largest CIA station in
North Africa. The annex housed 35 CIA personnel responsible for coordinating
the large arms
smuggling operation to Syria, circumventing Congress by calling
the CIA mission a liaison operation.
Two former special ops operatives Brandon Webb
and Jack Murphy, authors of 'Benghazi
-
The Definitive Report,' have since claimed that a bureaucratic
breakdown in communication between CIA and JSOC caused local Benghazi
radicals to attack and kill Americans on 9/11/12.
They believe that just days before an
assassination carried out by Special Operations of a popular Libyan CIA
informant had angered an al Qaeda affiliated militia called Ansar al-Sharia
to launch the attack as retribution.
The former Special Ops boys, one of whom was
friends with one of the killed Americans Glen Doherty, speculated
that the root cause of the American embassy deaths was the result of the
left hand not knowing what the right hand was doing in the
over-compartmentalized, ultra-guarded secrecy of competing clandestine
intelligence operations and that this problem commonly serves as a major
barrier and significant dysfunction of American foreign policy in general.
They believe the Ambassador was probably only
peripherally aware of the high presence of CIA and JSOC operations in the
area but was never directly involved or looped in.
This claim appears to be a disinformation ploy
to again absolve the higher ups Obama and Clinton of any responsibility. It
did little to quiet the conjecture surrounding the attack that Stevens knew
too much and had become a thorn in the side of the hierarchical status quo.
Though the former special ops authors may have
offered small minor details on the Benghazi story, obviously far more was
going down than they alluded to.
On October 26th, 2012 a mere two
weeks prior to the 'David Petraeus-Paula Broadwell affair' broke as the
scandalous headlines, Broadwell hyping her 'All In' biography of
the general spoke at the University of Denver divulging her inside scoop on
the Benghazi attack that had taken place a month and a half earlier.
She claimed the attack on the compound was
probable payback for CIA detaining local members from the same Libyan
militia responsible for the assault. Or that the attackers may have been
attempting to free their prisoners.
Though only one news reporter from Fox paid any
attention to Paula at the time, once their tryst was exposed a short time
afterwards, much speculation raised the issue that Paula Broadwell
unwittingly revealed classified information that could well have been leaked
through her intimacy with the then CIA Director.
That the mistress was privy to such insider
lowdown compromising sensitive US intelligence operations headquartered at
the CIA Benghazi annex is a very real possibility, especially since
classified documents were later uncovered at her North Carolina home.
In view of the CIA's fervent denial that any
prisoners were detained in Benghazi and Obama's January 2009 executive order
outlawing the CIA business of holding prisoners, Paula shooting her mouth
off as an insider know-it-all implicated her lover Petraeus and his CIA as
criminals engaging in an unlawful operation.
But then that illegal activity amounts to small
peanuts in comparison to the much bigger crime being committed by her lover
CIA boss Petraeus and his crime bosses Obama and Hillary for using the same
Libyan al Qaeda militants who murdered the four Americans on 9/11/12 to
smuggle guns from Benghazi across international borders to be used against
Assad in Syria.
Despite Ambassador Stevens' repeated requests
for more security, it was never given.
So when about 150 members of the local militia
Ansar al-Sharia stormed the gates of the compound carrying machine guns and
rocket propelled grenades (RPG's), the handful of unarmed Libyan security
contractors instantly fled and soon enough the building was engulfed in
flames.
The nearby annex in Benghazi where thirty-five CIA operatives worked
was called during the crisis to assist those Americans at the embassy.
CIA security officer Tyrone Woods
convinced his supervisor at the annex with five other security personnel to
rush to the embassy's aid. Both Woods and Glen Doherty were former Navy
Seals commandos who died from bullet wounds at the second attack at the
annex killed by a mortar after Sean Smith, an information officer, and
Ambassador Stevens had already died from smoke inhalation.
According to authors Webb and Murphy, due to
Woods and Doherty's heroics along with four other CIA analysts, the
remaining embassy staff were apparently able to safely escape the burning
compound.
An overhead surveillance drone had been
dispatched above the compound prior to that second attack that occurred at
the annex.
President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and
CIA Director Petraeus were all informed of the crisis unfolding during the
afternoon local Washington time. Yet they chose to not even bother
contacting the Marines stationed in the capital Tripoli, allegedly figuring
they would take too long to arrive on the scene in Benghazi.
So after ignoring the Ambassador's pleas urging
for more security for three straight months, they coldly refused to order
any further military assistance at the time the four Americans lost their
lives.
Instead they ordered UN Ambassador Susan Rice to
later lie to the American public claiming that the attack was instigated by
that anti-Moslem YouTube video. Under the increasing pressure of Benghazi
questions, suddenly Hillary keeled over with a brain clot to conveniently
dodge any more heat. And of course Petraeus was soon engulfed in scandal
with his mistress Broadwell, retiring from the CIA and out of sight for
months thereafter, conveniently ducking from his hot seat.
And then soon enough Clinton was resigning as
Secretary of State, evading any further scrutiny as the Ambassador's boss
most responsible for the deaths of the four Americans.
Another piece of incriminating evidence is that
the FBI
team sent in to investigate the Benghazi murders never even
arrived at the crime scene until three weeks after the attack, making sure
that vital forensic evidence could be conveniently lost, confiscated or
destroyed.
Despite having videotape that allowed individual
attackers to be identified by name, they all still remain free to this day.
Eleven months after the attack the US Justice Department last August in a
hollow gesture officially charged the alleged suspects in a sealed
indictment.
But without them in custody, it means nothing.
Clinton strategically figured she would lay low
long enough out of the public spotlight to effectively distance herself from
Benghazi to make another run for President in 2016.
But while briefly still back on the job and
those nagging Benghazi questions weren't going away fast enough, she
completely lost it, screaming,
"What difference at this point does it
make?",
..obviously all the difference in the world to
her and her buddy Barrack.
On 9/11 the year before last, Obama, Clinton and
Petraeus sacrificed four American lives that day to preserve their own
careers as powerful evil despots who with blind ambition would stop at
nothing to remain in power.
President Obama and Hillary Clinton have both
gone to great lengths to make sure that their cover-up concealing the truth
never gets exposed. With the attack taking place less than two months prior
to Obama's reelection, they are determined that the truth never sees the
light of day. However, big cracks are looming in their wall of defense and
their lies are falling like a house of cards.
Mounting evidence indicates both Obama and
Clinton were engaged in a highly covert and illicit arms smuggling operation
moving weapons from Libya through Turkey to the anti-Assad rebels in Syria.
And at stake for Obama and Clinton was their
future plans to win the presidential election in 2012 and 2016.
On August 2nd, 2013 three full weeks
prior to the sarin gas attack in the Damascus suburb killing scores of
Syrian civilians including children, UK's Telegraph reporter Damien
McElroy wrote an article asserting that Obama and Hillary are
guilty as charged, engaging in a gun-running operation that included surface
to air missiles and even chemical weapons speculating that a "false flag
operation" might occur as a deceptive ploy to make false accusations against
Assad.
Again, this article came out three weeks PRIOR
to Obama accusing Assad of using chemical weapons. No coincidence in the
timing. Since then renowned investigative reporter Seymour
Hersh who broke the My Lai massacre story and cover-up during the
Vietnam War and a host of other journalists have since provided convincing
evidence that the chemical attack last August was committed by US backed al
Qaeda rebels.
And those 35 CIA agents stationed at the nearby
Benghazi annex, word came out that every month since the event they have
been required to undergo polygraph tests just to ensure they keep quiet.
One insider even told CNN last
year,
"You jeopardize your family as well if you
talk to anyone about what happened."
Aside from Obama, Hillary and Petraeus evading
accountability at all cost, what is most incriminating is that the very same
Al Qaeda jihadists armed, financed and supported with American taxpayer
dollars during the Libyan regime-change are the exact same individuals who
have gotten away with murdering those four Americans in Benghazi.
For more than three years now America and Saudi
Arabia have been sponsoring and funding al Qaeda affiliated militia groups
from all over the Middle East and North Africa fighting Assad forces in
Syria in the latest regime-change war.
When the murders went down on 9/11/12, Hillary's
State Department had been acting as a cover supporting al Qaeda elements
smuggling arms to Syria to fight in that so called civil war. Much of
Gaddafi's huge stash of arms had been looted, falling into the hands of
American-backed rebel forces in Libya, including chemical weapons that were
never accounted for.
By pure accident, the Benghazi tragedy reveals
the ongoing war by proxy that the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel have been
waging against Syria and its strongest allies Iran and Russia.
As a side note, ex-CIA Director Petraeus was
allowed to retain his full status as a retired four star general at full pay
despite committing adultery while still serving as Afghanistan War commander
when military personnel of lower rank are customarily demoted and forced to
retire at a lower pension rate for the exact same offense of adultery.
Mistress Paula Broadwell also suffered no
formal consequence regarding her retention rank as major in the US Army
Reserves. It seems obvious that Petraeus has been rewarded for his loyal
silence on the Benghazi incident.
Additionally, several days after Petraeus ducked
out of sight in disgrace after resigning as CIA Director, Petraeus' wife as
the victim of his adulterous affair was suddenly being promoted by Obama to
a new cushy position made
especially for her earning near Petraeus' retirement pension of $200,000 per
year.
Then just over a week after his CIA resignation
Petraeus was called in to testify before
the House Intelligence Committee but given a free pass in his not having to
testify under a sworn oath to disclose the full truth of what he knew. So he
proceeded to lie before Congress claiming that he consistently said that an
al Qaeda affiliated militia group was behind the attack.
In fact Petraeus secretly flew to Libya
immediately after the attack and upon his return to the US a couple days
later Petraeus held the official administration line they knew to be false
that the Benghazi attack was due to the bogus anti-Moslem video.
Of course with the scandal causing his own
presidential ambitions to be thoroughly shattered, Petraeus more recently
has gone on public record stating that Hillary Clinton would make "an
excellent president."
Clearly he is towing the line as a good little
boy for keeping his mouth shut for Hillary and Barrack.
Obama lied when he promised to ensure that those
guilty of the attack would be brought to justice. Now going on two years
later not one of the attackers has even been apprehended or arrested. With
the murderers in the Benghazi assault still at large, many of the attackers
afterwards moved on with the arms they were helping to smuggle to join
US-supported rebel forces fighting the Assad government in Syria.
They may have been silenced by now, secretly
killed by judge, jury and executioner President Obama in his lust to kill
his enemies with drone missile attacks. In any event, rest assure none of
the perpetrators behind the Benghazi attack will ever be captured alive or
prosecuted.
They simply know too much. Last 9/11/13 barely a
peep was heard from the mainstream media on the very first anniversary of
the Benghazi tragedy. The reason is all too obvious.
Many of the family members of the murdered
Americans felt that Obama and his administration were responsible for their
loved ones deaths. Some complained about Obama's condolences as brusk,
insincere and insensitive.
They were disturbed further with Obama's response
on a 60
Minutes (below video) segment
in late January 2013.
Obama and Hillary were answering questions about
Benghazi when Obama quoted Defense Secretary Robert Gates,
"At this moment somewhere, somehow, somebody
in the federal government's screwing up" as he turned to Hillary
laughing at his joke about their Benghazi screw-up that killed four
Americans.
They also had to be upset hearing the president
on another occasion callously dismissing the Benghazi tragedy as "a
sideshow."
Not surprisingly, the US installed puppet
government in Libya has been of no assistance in its lack
of cooperation with revealing any further details of the attack.
Last June the chaos, lawlessness and terror in Benghazi only continued as thirty-one Libyans
protesting their grievances against an al Qaeda militia group were brutally
massacred outside the al Qaeda headquarters.
The entire eastern region of Libya today is
still not under control of the national government, which has largely been
taken over by US backed al Qaeda affiliates.
Libya today is in complete shambles steeped in
corruption, instability and violence.
Meanwhile, the two American criminals most
responsible for the attack, President Obama and presidential heir-apparent
Hilary Clinton need to be held accountable for their crimes along with their
other partner-in-crime General Petraeus.
With the belated truth behind Benghazi slowly
coming out, Obama should be impeached and Hillary must never become
president.
Ironically the crime of
Nixon's Watergate
cover-up that brought down the first and only president in US history forced
to resign in disgrace pales in comparison to the crimes committed by the
likes of the Obama administration.
