Many questions have
arisen about what direction Latin America and the
so-called pink tide will take since Hugo Chavezs
death and his successor Nicolas Maduros victory in the
Venezuelan presidential elections against Henrique
Capriles Radonski on April 14, 2013.
These questions broadly
focus on the rest of Latin America and the regions
leftist governments and movements.
Several important questions
are being asked.
When looking at this question caution against
oversimplification and romanticization is needed.
A case in point about this oversimplification
and romanticization is that Paraguays President Fernando Luga was
praised as a steward by the leftists, even though he had to politically work
as a centrist. Linked to this, there is also an important question about
what right-wing and left-wing really mean.
Do governments, groups, and movements that call
or consider themselves right-wing or left-wing really fit into such
categories?
In this context, the terms left and right need to be operationalized
before any discussion can move forward. For purposes of discussion, the
left would best be operationalized or defined as a political position that
advocates reform or, in its radical form, revolution.
Its proponents describe it as a position aimed
at reducing or ending social inequality whereas its critics view it as
either utopian or destabilizing.
On the other hand, the right would best be
operationalized or defined as a conservative and reactionary political
position. Its proponents describe it as traditional and a safeguard of
stability whereas its critics and opponents say that it supports social
hierarchies that maintain societal inequality.
Socio-politically, the terms left and right originate in the upheavals
of the French Revolution.
The French Estates-General of the Bourbon
monarchy and its revolutionary predecessor, the French National Assembly,
became divided between those groups that supported the Bourbon monarchy,
clergy, and old regime and those groups that opposed them in favor of
revolution and republicanism.
The supporters of the old regime would sit to
the right of the legislative president or speaker in the legislative chamber
whereas those groups that supported change and a new regime would sit to
the left.
It is also important to note that the right
emerged as a reaction to the formation of the calls for change from the
left.
A Plethora of Lefts
in Latin America
It should be pointed out that contrary to the highly simplistic dualism
portrayed by the US government and most leftists about the categorization of
Latin America into left or right is overly simplistic.
Things are actually not clear-cut. This means
that the above operationalized definitions of right and left are
essentially ideal-types.
The leftist governments and movements of Latin America are an eclectic
bunch. Thinking of them all in terms of one-size-fits-all is naive and
ignores the history and local circumstances/variables that have constructed
and influenced each one. In short, each one has its own identity. At least
at the grassroots level, they want local agency, relatively more inclusive
societies, and a reduction of the influential role of Latin Americas
comprador elite oligarchs.
Latin Americas comprador elites are the local representatives of the
foreign corporations, governments, and interests that have exploited
Latin America for centuries.
These comprador elites can frankly be described
as either the House Negros or racist upper class that have historically
ruled Latin America and managed its wealth and resources for the changing
centers of power in other parts of the world that have controlled the area.
Today, the regional comprador elites are mostly
aligned with the United States and prefer Miami or New York City to Caracas
or Quito.
Latin American left-wing governments do not strictly operate to the left.
There is even a debate over whether the Cuban
socialist project is genuinely reforming or if it will eventually follow the
paths of capitalist restoration like China and Vietnam. The typology of
Latin America described by the sociologist James Petras will help
frame this as the most workable way to conceptualize the left in Latin
America.
Petras divides Latin America among four
competing blocs or groups.
These are:
-
the radical left, which includes the
smaller Marxist formations in Latin America and guerrilla groups
like the FARC and sectors of various movements like the Rural
Landless Movement in Brazil that form a dispersed political bloc
that rejects any type of concessions to neo-liberalism
-
the pragmatic left, which includes the
governments of Cuba, Venezuela, and Bolivia and the majority of
leftist intellectuals in Latin America
-
the pragmatic neo-liberals, which
includes Argentina and Brazil
-
the doctrinaire neo-liberal regimes,
which includes Colombia and most of Central America.
The Petras typology helps clarify why the US
government considers certain left-wing governments in Latin America as being
correct or good and other left-wing governments in Latin America as being
wrong or bad.
This typology also does not consider the
Argentine, Brazilian, and Uruguayan governments leftist. It sees these Latin
American governments as neo-liberal regimes and supporters of big capital
that pragmatically adopt certain populist policies and project leftist
images.
The sociologist Stuart Halls theoretical work gives additional
perspective to the Petras typology.
Hall argued that due to the rise of Thatcherism
in Britain, the left in Britain was forced to imitate the right to gain
power and popularity and that the leftists lacked a proper political
program. Tony Blairs right-wing orientation within the British
Labour Party is a case in point.
What Hall says may be in reverse operation in
Latin America where the right has either imitated the left or presented
itself as centrist or oriented more leftwards.
It can also be true of the left orienting
itself rightwards.
Moreover, one of the threats to the leftist movements in Latin America is
corruption and co-optation. Bureaucracy in this regards can be a threat.
For example, some supporters of Venezuela became
uneasy around 2005. People like the Italian documentary maker Gabriel
Muzio, who was praised in Caracas for his earlier work on Venezuela and
then condemned as a falsifier for his later work (which the Venezuelan
government itself funded), changed their positions on Venezuela.
They complained that they saw the idea of
popular power being upset by a concentration of power by the countrys
bureaucracy.
Leftist Masks
It should be clear that all leftists are not really leftists.
For example, the Chilean Socialists are
committed to neo-liberal economics.
Although Mexican President Enrique Pena Nietos
Institutional Revolutionary Party is called a socialist party, it is
doubtful that Mexico will dramatically change its politics and policies
aside from cosmetic changes.
Even in Venezuela questionable business deals
are made with foreign companies, like the selling of the Deltana Platform to
Chevron-Texaco. Moreover, if leftists are protecting the status quo in their
respective societies then they are actually right-wing under the
operationalized definition of right that was outlined earlier.
Groups and individuals that have actually present themselves as socialists
or communists have been major supporters of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
For example, before he even became Brazils
president, the Marxist sociologist Fernando Henrique Cardoso was
appointed as finance minister by President Itamar Franco with the IMF
becoming Cardosos most enthusiastic supporter after it had three different
Brazilian finance ministers consecutively fired.
Cardoso pushed for neo-liberal de-regulation and
the privatization of Brazils public sector. Like many other revolutionaries
a lot of the Marxist guerrillas in Brazil who fought against the military
junta in their country have put away their fatigues and copies of Das
Kapital for IMF and World Bank economic manuals.
This is why union boss Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva of the Brazilian Workers Party was renounced as traitor and a
lackey of
the IMF and World Bank by the workers of
the Occupied Factories Movement of Brazil after he became president.
President Dilma Rousseff, Lulas
successor and a former Marxist guerrilla, is continuing his policies.
This is why there are those that pessimistically
say that you never know what to expect when you vote for the leftists in
Latin America.
Capitalist or Socialist
Autonomy?
The emergence of left-wing governments has been a manifestation of the
decades of local struggle and change in the lower political levels of Latin
American societies.
Before it started to reflect itself at the
national level, the leftward trend began at the level of the municipalities.
It has also been progressing in phases. Even the Bolivarian Movement has
gone through phases where it has progressively radicalized.
Are domestic or local capital being served by socialist projects or is there
common interest? It can be argued that the political current in Latin
America is mostly a question of financial and economic independence, rather
than a socialist project challenging the capitalist world-system.
This means that the trend is about empowering
and supporting local capital. The situation for domestic capital has
actually improved and expanded in the societies of Latin Americas leftist
countries, from Brazil to Venezuela.
Even Garcia Linera, the vice-president of
Bolivia, has viewed the leftist trend in his country in terms of a state-run
project for local capitalist development.
Politically and sociologically, the question of intentions is also important
here when evaluating this. Populism and regional autonomy are advocated by
both socialist movements and local capital alike.
It is in the context of regional autonomy that
foreign policy independence is a key feature of the pink tide and its altermundialistas.
Generally, what appears to exist regionally is
an alliance of interests between local capital and social movements that
have additionally turned to the international capitalist rivals of Wall
Street to oppose the United States in Latin America.
