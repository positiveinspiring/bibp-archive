# Skype Collaborated With NSA Long Before PRISM - The New York Times

WASHINGTON
When Max Kelly, the chief security
officer
for Facebook, left the social media
company in 2010, he did not go to Google, Twitter or a similar Silicon
Valley concern.
Instead the man who was responsible for
protecting the personal information of Facebooks more than one billion
users from outside attacks went to work for another giant institution
that manages and analyzes large pools of data: the National Security
Agency.
Mr. Kellys move to the spy agency, which
has not previously been reported, underscores the increasingly deep
connections between Silicon Valley and the agency and the degree to
which they are now in the same business. Both hunt for ways to collect,
analyze and exploit large pools of data about millions of Americans.
The only difference is that the NSA does it
for intelligence, and Silicon Valley does it to make money.
The disclosure of the spy agencys program
called Prism, which is said to collect the e-mails and other Web
activity of foreigners using major Internet companies like,
...has prompted the companies to deny that
the agency has direct access to their computers, even as they
acknowledge complying with secret NSA court orders for specific data.
Yet technology experts and former
intelligence officials say the convergence between Silicon Valley and
the NSA and the rise of data mining - both as an industry and as a
crucial intelligence tool - have created a more complex reality.
Silicon Valley has what the spy agency
wants: vast amounts of private data and the most sophisticated software
available to analyze it. The agency in turn is one of Silicon Valleys
largest customers for what is known as data analytics, one of the
valleys fastest-growing markets.
To get their hands on the latest software
technology to manipulate and take advantage of large volumes of data,
United States intelligence agencies invest in Silicon Valley start-ups,
award classified contracts and recruit technology experts like Mr.
Kelly.
We are all in these Big Data business
models, said Ray Wang, a technology analyst and chief executive of
Constellation Research, based in San Francisco.
There are a lot of connections now
because the data scientists and the folks who are building these
systems have a lot of common interests.
Although Silicon Valley has sold equipment
to the NSA and other intelligence agencies for a generation, the
interests of the two began to converge in new ways in the last few years
as advances in computer storage technology drastically reduced the costs
of storing enormous amounts of data - at the same time that the value of
the data for use in consumer marketing began to rise.
These worlds overlap, said Philipp S.
Kr√ºger, chief executive of Explorist, an Internet start-up in New
York.
The sums the NSA spends in Silicon Valley
are classified, as is the agencys total budget, which independent
analysts say is $8 billion to $10 billion a year.
Despite the companies assertions that they
cooperate with the agency only when legally compelled, current and
former industry officials say the companies sometimes secretly put
together teams of in-house experts to find ways to cooperate more
completely with the NSA and to make their customers information more
accessible to the agency.
The companies do so, the officials say,
because they want to control the process themselves. They are also under
subtle but powerful pressure from the NSA to make access easier.
Skype, the Internet-based calling service,
began its own secret program,
Project Chess, to explore the legal and
technical issues in making Skype calls readily available to intelligence
agencies and law enforcement officials, according to people briefed on
the program who asked not to be named to avoid trouble with the
intelligence agencies.
Project Chess, which has never been
previously disclosed, was small, limited to fewer than a dozen people
inside Skype, and was developed as the company had sometimes contentious
talks with the government over legal issues, said one of the people
briefed on the project.
The project began about five years ago,
before most of the company was sold by its parent, eBay, to outside
investors in 2009. Microsoft acquired Skype in an $8.5 billion deal that
was completed in October 2011.
A Skype executive
denied last year in a blog post that recent changes in the way Skype
operated were made at the behest of Microsoft to make snooping easier
for law enforcement.
It appears, however, that Skype figured out
how to cooperate with the intelligence community before Microsoft took
over the company, according to documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden,
a former contractor for the NSA One of the documents about the Prism
program made public by Mr. Snowden says Skype joined Prism on Feb. 6,
2011.
Microsoft executives are no longer willing
to affirm
statements, made by Skype several years ago, that Skype calls could
not be wiretapped. Frank X. Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman, declined to
comment.
In its recruiting in Silicon Valley, the NSA
sends some of its most senior officials to lure the best of the best.
No less than Gen.
Keith B. Alexander, the agencys
director and the chief of the Pentagons Cyber Command, showed up at one
of the worlds largest hacker conferences in Las Vegas last summer,
looking stiff in an uncharacteristic T-shirt and jeans, to give the
keynote speech.
His main purpose at Defcon, the conference,
was to recruit hackers for his spy agency.
NSA badges are often seen on the lapels of
officials at other technology and information security conferences.
Theyre very open about their interest
in recruiting from the hacker community, said Jennifer Granick, the
director of civil liberties at Stanford Law Schools Center for
Internet and Society.
But perhaps no one embodies the tightening
relationship between the NSA and the valley more than Kenneth A.
Minihan.
A career Air Force intelligence officer, Mr.
Minihan was the director of the NSA during the Clinton administration
until his retirement in the late 1990s, and then he ran the agencys
outside professional networking organization.
Today he is managing director of Paladin
Capital Group, a venture capital firm based in Washington that in part
specializes in financing start-ups that offer high-tech solutions for
the NSA and other intelligence agencies.
In effect, Mr. Minihan is an advanced scout
for the NSA as it tries to capitalize on the latest technology to
analyze and exploit the vast amounts of data flowing around the world
and inside the United States.
The members of Paladins strategic advisory
board include Richard C. Schaeffer Jr., a former NSA executive.
While Paladin is a private firm, the
American intelligence community has its own in-house venture capital
company, In-Q-Tel, financed by the
Central Intelligence Agency to invest in high-tech start-ups.
Many software technology firms involved in
data analytics are open about their connections to intelligence
agencies.
Gary King, a co-founder and chief
scientist at Crimson Hexagon, a start-up in Boston, said in an interview
that he had given talks at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., about his
companys social media analytics tools.
The future holds the prospect of ever
greater cooperation between Silicon Valley and the NSA because data
storage is expected to increase at an annual compound rate of 53 percent
through 2016, according to the International Data Corporation.
We reached a tipping point, where the
value of having user data rose beyond the cost of storing it, said
Dan Auerbach, a technology analyst with the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, an electronic privacy group in San Francisco.
Now we have an incentive to keep it
forever.
Social media sites in the meantime are
growing as voluntary data mining operations on a scale that rivals or
exceeds anything the government could attempt on its own.
You willingly hand over data to
Facebook that you would never give voluntarily to the government,
said Bruce Schneier, a technologist and an author.

Helped NSA Access Customers' Data

Skype, the web-based communications
company, reportedly set up a secret program to make it easier for US
surveillance agencies to access customers' information.
The program, called Project Chess and
first revealed
by the New York Times on Thursday, was said to have been
established before Skype was bought by
Microsoft in 2011.
Microsoft's links with US security are
under intense scrutiny following the Guardian's
revelation of Prism, a surveillance program run by the
National Security Agency (NSA),
that claimed "direct" access to its servers and those of rivals
including Apple, Facebook and Google.
Project Chess was set up to explore the
legal and technical issues involved in making Skype's communications
more readily available to law enforcement and security officials,
according to the Times.
Only a handful of executives were aware
of the plan. The company did not immediately return a call for
comment.
Last year Skype denied reports that it
had changed its software following the Microsoft acquisition in
order to allow law enforcement easier access to communications.
"Nothing could be more contrary to
the Skype philosophy," Mark Gillett, vice president of
Microsoft's Skype division,
said in a blog post.
According to the
documents, Skype had
been co-operating with the
's
scheme since February 2011, eight months before the software giant
took it over.
The document gives little detail on the
technical nature of that cooperation. Microsoft declined to comment.
The news comes as the tech firms
are attempting to distance themselves
from the
revelations.
All the firm's listed as participating
in the Prism scheme have denied that they give the
"direct" access to their servers, as claimed by the slide
presentation, and said that they only comply with legal requests
made through the courts.
But since the story broke a more nuanced
picture of how the tech firms work with the surveillance authorities
has emerged. The US authorities have become increasingly interested
in tech firms and its employees after initially struggling to keep
up with the shift to digital communications.
officials have held high level talks with executives in the tech
firms and are actively recruiting in the tech community.
'That information is how
they make their money'
Shane Harris, author of
The Watchers:
The Rise of America's Surveillance State, said the
had a crisis in the late 1990s when it realized communication was
increasingly digital and it was falling behind in its powers to
track that data.
"You can not overstate that without
this data the NSA would be blind," he said.
The
employs former valley executives, including Max Kelly, the
former chief security officer for Facebook, and has increasingly
sought to hire people in the hacker community.
Former NSA director lieutenant general
Kenneth Minihan has taken the opposite tack and is helping
create the next generation of tech security firms. Minihan is
managing director of Paladin Capital, a private equity firm that has
a fund dedicated to investing in homeland security.
Paladin also employs Dr Alf
Andreassen, a former technical adviser for naval warfare who was
also for classified national programs at AT&T and Bell Laboratories.
Harris said the ties were only likely to
deepen as technology moves ever more of our communications on line.
He warned the move was likely to present more problems for the tech
firms as their consumers worry about their
privacy.
"It's been fascinating for me
listening to the push back from the tech companies," said
Harris.
Christopher Soghoian, a senior
policy analyst studying technological surveillance at the American
Civil Liberties Union, said the relationship between the tech giants
and the
has a fundamental - and ironic - flaw that guarantees the
scandal is unlikely
to be the last time tensions surface between the two.
The US spying apparatus and Silicon
Valley's top tech firms are basically in the same business,
collecting information on people, he said.
"It's a weird symbiotic
relationship. It's not that Facebook and Google are trying to
build a surveillance system but they effectively have," he said.
"If they wanted to, Google and
Facebook could use technology to tackle the issue, anonymizing
and deleting their customers' information. But that information
is how they make their money, so that is never going to happen."
