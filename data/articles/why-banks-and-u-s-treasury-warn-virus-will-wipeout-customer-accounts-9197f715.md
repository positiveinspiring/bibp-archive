Jack Jew, Secretary of the Department of
the US Treasury
told the press at a conference called the CNBC
Institutional Investor
Delivering Alpha (IIDA) that hundreds of cyber-attacks on the financial
system (i.e. banks and other monetary institutions) hold,
"the potential to cause massive economic
damage if 'core operational functions' of major financial institutions
were compromised."
Lew emphasized that utilities corporations have
been victims of cyber-attacks as well and this,
"incursion at a strategic point along the
network could lead to market disruption and massive harm."
The Treasury Secretary
said:
"Far too many hedge funds, asset managers,
insurance providers, exchanges, financial market utilities, and banks
should and could be doing more. In particular, it is imperative that
firms collaborate with government agencies and with other firms.
Disclosing security breaches is often perceived as something that could
harm a firm's reputation. This has made many businesses reluctant to
reveal information about cyber incidents."
The warning included threats that,
"the consequences of cyber incidents are
serious. When credit card data is stolen, it disturbs lives and damages
consumer confidence. When trade secrets are robbed, it undercuts
America's businesses and undermines U.S. competitiveness."
Earlier this month the,
...called
for the passage of a proposed
cybersecurity bill through the Senate that would save banking customer's
account balances from hackers.
Wall Street and technocratic corporations are
decrying a need for,
"a government-industry cyberwar council to
stave off terrorist attacks that could trigger financial panic by
temporarily wiping out account balances."
In 2012, Kaspersky Lab, a Moscow-based computer
security firm has found a
cyber
surveillance virus that was,
-
spying on banking transactions
-
stealing
login information for social networks, email and instant messaging in the
Middle East,
...specifically targeting Lebanon's,
-
BlomBank
-
ByblosBank
-
Credit Libanais,
...and infected computers also include,
The virus' focus on online banking makes it a
potential threat to banking systems worldwide.
Researchers warned that
this virus was conducting surveillance on banking transactions and being
used to steal money out of targeted accounts. The virus called called
Gauss was a new virus; related to Stuxnet, Flame and Duqu, yet a more
sophisticated, state-sponsored cyber-espionage tool.
Researchers from the security software
manufacturer Symantec Corp, confirm Kaspersky Lab's summation that Gauss is related to previous
government-created cyber warfare viruses.
Gauss is
capable of being used as a weapon to attack industrial control systems,
just like Stuxnet which was used to go after Iran's Natanz nuclear power
plant facility in 2010.
Gauss can encrypt programs that are compressed
onto a USB drive and decompress them once the virus is able to contact to a
targeted computer.
Kapersky Lab stated:
"After looking at Stuxnet, Duqu and Flame,
we can say with a high degree of certainty that Gauss comes from the
same 'factory' or 'factories.' All these attack toolkits represent the
high end of nation-state-sponsored cyber-espionage and cyber war
operations."
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
analyzed Gauss' potential threat to the US.
Peter Boogaard, DHS spokesperson
commented:
"The department's cyber security analysts
are working with organizations that could potentially be affected to
detect, mitigate and prevent such threats."
Because of the
fiasco in mortgage-backed securities
that begun in 2008, the
international banks have been propping up the American financial system to
stave off a complete monetary collapse in the US.
If the intention is to cause another upset in
the global monetary system, Gauss may be the mode in which they are able to
carry this out.
Just like during the MF Global scandal where Jon Corzine
ordered segregated customer funds to be secretly redirected into
accounts in JPMorgan, Gauss could redirect funds from bank accounts to
undisclosed places.
Guass, which is an online banking surveillance
virus, has the capability of electronically transferring information out of
customer accounts to be redirected to another location. The banking
industry, who is now threatening the wipe-out of customer accounts, would be
dramatically affected by Gauss were this virus to cause every banking
customer to become insolvent overnight.
Imagine the call for a banking holiday because
Gauss has infected the all domestic financial computer systems. In order to
purge the virus, all banks would need to shut down for a specified amount of
time in order to reconfigure their computers.
Perhaps on a Friday afternoon, the major banks
will all announce that they will shut down to customer activity so they can
"get rid of" Gauss from their system.
The banks might say that they will reopen to the
public on Monday morning only to find that customer funds were
electronically transferred from private checking accounts out to off-shore
banks where they could not be touched.
Two years ago, Trusteer, the Israeli-based
security firm, discovered a banking virus that will steal funds from
customers and cover its tracks in the process.
This new creation from the
SpyEye Trojan will,
"swap out banking Web pages... preventing
customers from realizing that their money is gone."
This Trojan waits patiently for the user to
visit their online banking site, copies their login and password, then
divulges the personal data surveyed; such as debit/credit card information.
When the user inputs their credit/debit card
information in to conduct a purchase, the Trojan will swap web pages and
siphon out the funds. According to Truseeter, this is a "post transaction
attack".
The cover-up capability of this Trojan is
remarkable. It will edit balance amounts, line by line transactions, and all
activity that would trigger suspicion by the owner of the account.
In 2011, SpyEye Trojan
attacked Android mobile online banking by siphoning out data from the
customer to be used by the hacker.
SpyEye also changes while circumventing
mobile SMS which is a security measure taken by banks when a customer is
conducting online account transactions to certify that the correct user is
conducting the business.
SpyEye was
victimizing Verizon customers with fake billing pages that require the
customer to log in which reveals personal financial data to the virus
concerning the user.
This Trojan can deter anti-virus software,
jumping over firewalls and sit undetected between the browser and the
computer redirecting the user to pages without ever being caught.
