# The U.S. Airstrikes in Northern Iraq are All About Oil

Last night, President Barack Obama
announced that he was authorizing American
airstrikes in Iraq.
He described his intervention as a,
"humanitarian effort to help save thousands
of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain" and as an effort "to
protect our American personnel."
One word that he didnt mention is "oil,"
but it lies near the center of American motives for intervention.
The United States is conducting airdrops to aid
the Yazidis who have fled the advance of
Islamic State militants, but it is conducting airstrikes around Erbil, which
is to the east. There are American consular personnel in Erbil, but they
could be evacuated if necessary.
What Obama left unsaid was that
Erbil, a city of 1.5 million, is the
capital of the Kurdish regional government and the
administrative center of its oil industry, which accounts for
about a quarter of Iraqs oil.
The Kurds claim that if they were to become an
independent state, they would have the ninth-largest oil reserves in the
world. And oil wells are near Erbil.
If the Islamic State were to take over Erbil, they would endanger Iraqs oil
production and, by extension, global access to oil. Prices would surge at a
time when Europe, which buys oil from Iraq, has still not escaped the global
recession.
Oil prices have already risen in response to the
Islamic States threat to Erbil, and on Thursday, American oil companies
Chevron and Exxon Mobile
began evacuating their personnel from
Kurdistan.
But oil traders are predicting that American
intervention could halt the rise.
"In essence we find U.S. air strikes more
bearish than bullish for oil as the act finally draws a line for IS and
reinforces both the stability in south Iraq and in Kurdistan," Oliver
Jakob, a Swiss oil analyst,
told Reuters.
In portraying American intervention in Iraq as a
purely humanitarian effort, Obama is following the script he read
from in Libya, when
he justified American intervention as an
effort to prevent a massacre in Benghazi.
In a March 28, 2011
address to the nation, Obama painted the American intervention as a
response to,
"brutal repression and a looming
humanitarian crisis."
Oil was not mentioned, even though Libya was the
worlds sixteenth-largest oil producer in 2009 and a major supplier to
Europe.
But oil was most likely involved, as became
clear when, after preventing a massacre in Benghazi, the United States and
its coalition partners stuck around to topple the regime of Muammar Qaddafi.
If the
Obama
administration wanted to prevent the worlds peoples from brutal
dictators and repressive regimes or from takeovers by terrorist groups,
there are other countries besides Libya and Iraq where it could intervene.
What distinguishes these two countries is that they are major oil producers.
The United States should worry about the global oil supply. It is important for global economic and
political stability.
And having a significant chunk of it fall into the
hands of a group like the Islamic State should certainly be a concern. But
if Obama is worried about the worlds oil supply, then he should say so
forthrightly and not leave himself in a position where he will be unable to
justify or explain further intervention after the airdrops to the Yazidis
are completed.
And the administration should also have a plan
for making sure that in sending out the Air Force, it will actually end a
dire threat to Iraqs oil production and put Iraq back on its feet.
In Libya, the U.S. and its partners succeeded in
getting rid of Muammar Qaddafi, but not in resolving the countrys
humanitarian crisis or in keeping its oil flowing. Oil production has
plummeted as Libya has been plunged into anarchy after Qaddafis fall.
The challenge in Erbil and Iraq is even more
daunting.
