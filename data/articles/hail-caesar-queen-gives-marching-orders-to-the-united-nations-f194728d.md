Regarding the queens speech to
the
United Nations, we were told by the British Mission to the United
Nations that the queen,
"Will be taking a global perspective. She
will touch on progress made since she was last here and challenges that
remain."
For a woman who says she is not head of any
country-only titular head of state of 16 countries including Australia,
Canada and New Zealand and the nominal representative of 54 governments in
the British Commonwealth, who is fooling who? Why should be the people of
the world listen to a little old lady from Britain?
The answer is because her hereditary demands it.
The visit by the queen, which was billed as low key-a five hour visit-was
designed to get the global agenda of sustainable development and climate
control back on track and to make a statement. Nothing the queen does is low
key as every visit, and every word has a meaning and a goal for total
control.
First let's take a look at the queen herself.
According to
Who Owns the
World by Kevin Cahill, the queen is the legal owner of 6,600 million acres
of land that equals one sixth of the earth's non-ocean surface. She is the
only person on earth who owns whole countries and who owns countries that
refer
not her own domestic territory.
This land ownership is separate from her role as
head of state and is different from other monarchies - like Norway, Belgium,
and Denmark, where no such claim is made. The value of her holdings is
approximately $33T, more than the estimated value of all of the earth's
natural resources which is estimated to be $25T.
Secondly, the physical structure of the United Nations and its agenda
represents the completion of the dream and aspirations of British aristocrat
Cecil Rhodes to return the United States and the rest of the world back
under British rule.
He felt that,
"too little of the globe was British
territory and if we had retained America there would be millions more of
English living."
In Rhode's 1877 will, it says,
"the ultimate recovery of the United States
of America as an integral part of the British Empire, the consolidation
of the whole Empire, the inauguration of a system of colonial
Representation in the Imperial Parliament which may tend to weld
together the disjointed Members of the Empire," which may well
ultimately be achieved, by the Roundtable which "publicized the idea of
and the name 'British Commonwealth of Nations.'"
The executors of Rhodes' six wills had concerns
and fears about what kind of structure all of this should take.
According to Dr. Carroll Quigley in his
The Anglo-American Establishment published in 1981, they concluded that they
would have to transform the British Empire into,
"a Commonwealth of Nations and then place
that system within a League of Nations."
The United Nations is the successor to the
League of Nations and the Commonwealth is inside the U.N. In other words, we
are there. The representatives to the UN should have greeted her, "Hail
Caesar"!
It should be noted that from 1946-1989 the British Empire gave
"independence" to many of their former colonies.
How they did this was to
allow them to have their own parliament with representative government and
their own prime minister. Lest you think they can do as they please, the
queen has her own appointed representative called the Director-General that
reports to her everything going on in the country and who reads her
instructions after the prime minister provides his report at the opening of
their parliament.
As each country obtained independence, they also got a vote at the United
Nations. Today the Commonwealth has the potential of 54 votes to America's
one vote. You will find if you look at the number of Commonwealth countries
that are members of the other UN agencies like
the IMF,
World Bank, World
Health Organization, World Trade Organization, etc., the U.S. is outvoted.
In three separate interviews with representatives from three Commonwealth
nations in 2002, I was told by each of them who looked at me with fear and
terror when I challenged them to leave the Commonwealth that they could not.
In fact the queen made reference to the Commonwealth,
Since I addressed you last, the Commonwealth, too, has grown vigorously To
become a group of nations representing nearly two billion people. Last
November, when I opened the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in
Trinidad and Tobago, I told the delegates that the Commonwealth had the
opportunity to lead.
Today I offer you the same message.
Queen Elizabeth II
addresses the UN General Assembly for the second time in her career.
Pictured behind her are
(left to right) Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon;
Ali Abdussalam Treki,
President of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly
and Muhammad Shaaban,
Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and Conference
Management.
Do you now see the meaning of the words and how she used words? The queen
also made mention to the
Millennium Development Goals.
The bottom line,
these wonderful socialistic humanitarian goals where the rich countries of
the world will give a primary education to every child in the world, reduce
poverty and starvation, HIV/Aids, and give $50 to every slum dweller to
improve their lives will cost rich between $40-$60B a year according to the
United Nations.
This money is to come from an assessment on
every country's Gross Domestic Product called "ODA" to the tune of .07%. In
fact, you could call it a global tax.
For as long as I have been covering global
meetings, this has been a request by the United Nations, wow it is a request
by the queen. Does anyone know who will get these monies? No.
However, it just so happens that the following
ten countries which are "Highly Indebted Poor Countries" are members of the
Commonwealth:
Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana, Guyana, Malawi,
Mozambique, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zambia.
Do you see what I see? The civilized word is
"transfer of wealth."
That brings us to the environment, Agenda 21, sustainable development, and
climate change. While the first pre-United Nations Conference on population
was held in 1927 with the assistance of the League of Nations, it was not
until 1972 that the United Nations held its own environmental conference in
Stockholm.
Eleven years before in 1961, Prince
Philip
the queen's husband and Prince
Bernhard of the Netherlands started the
World Wildlife Fund, considered one of the oldest and largest environmental
groups in the world. World Wildlife Fund is responsible for the publication
of many studies and reports on how to save the environment.
These documents
have been used to support and implement
Agenda 21.
In 1972 the
Club of Rome published
Limits to Growth which said the world
could not sustain the population and that something would have to be done.
Since the dictates of Agenda 21 are based on Limits to Growth assumptions,
in a 2006 interview with
Maurice Strong who chaired the 1972 and 1992
earth summits, I asked him if in looking back the assumptions and computer
models that were used for that report were wrong, given today's data, and he
admitted that they should be revised.
The bottom line is that most of the
environmentalism and ideas for environmentalism are being birthed in
England.
It was a British scientist, James Lovelock, who formulated the "Gaia
Hypothesis" that the earth is a living organism and that it must
be protected from you and me.
Prince Charles has been involved in
environmentalism since 1970 and is responsible for helping to get Agenda 21
to be approved by 25,000 conference participants and delegates at the 1992
UNCED conference through his Prince of Wales International Business Leaders
Forum. When you study Agenda 21, it basically is a return of the earth to
feudalism.
The idea being that you and I cannot protect the
earth's resources so the United Nation's has to do it moves the $25T value
of earth's natural resources into the balance sheets of the QUEEN.
The cost
to implement climate change is estimated to be between $80-$100B a year.
British Petroleum (BP) which is largely owned by the queen could make up
their
current oil spill expenses very quickly if the U.S. government is stupid
enough to pass "cap and trade."
Lastly, several years ago I raised the question,
"Does the Queen of Canada"
become the "Queen of America" through the North American Free Trade
Agreement?
It appears to be so according to my research.
Although Cecil Rhodes talked about "world
peace", I believe what the queen is talking about is the WHOLE PIECE.
The operation we are discussing here has been 133 years in operation with
many actors contributing to its establishment. They include many British and
American industrialists and bankers such as
the Rockefeller's, Vanderbilt's,
the Whitney's, the Morgan's and Schiff's.
It includes those that are members of the Royal
Institute for International Affairs and America's counterpart:
the
Council on Foreign Relations, it
includes the International Chamber of Commerce, the World Economic
Forum, and many other global organizations and NGO's.
For those who still don't understand what
happened at the United Nations on July 6, 2010 is that the conquering ruler
of the world came and delivered a sharp admonition to the representatives
that it is time to act.
She ended
her speech with,
In my lifetime, the United Nations has moved
from being a high-minded aspiration to being a real force the common
good. In tomorrow's world, we must all work together as hard as ever if
we are truly to be United Nations.
Do you want to be
the
United Nations or do you want to be the United States of America?
Queen Elizabeth II - The Largest Landowner on Earth
from
WhoOwnsTheWorld Website
Queen Elizabeth II, head of state of the United
Kingdom and of 31 other states and territories, is the legal owner of about
6,600 million acres of land, one sixth of the earths non ocean surface.
She is the only person on earth who owns whole countries, and who owns
countries that are not her own domestic territory. This land ownership is
separate from her role as head of state and is different from other
monarchies where no such claim is made - Norway, Belgium, Denmark etc.
The value of her land holding. £17,600,000,000,000 (approx).
This makes her the richest individual on earth. However, there is no way
easily to value her real estate. There is no current market in the land of
entire countries. At a rough estimate of $5,000 an acre, and based on the
sale of Alaska to the USA by the Tsar, and of Louisiana to the USA by
France, the Queens land holding is worth a notional $33,000,000,000,000
(Thirty three trillion dollars or about £17,600,000,000,000).
Her holding is based on the laws of the
countries she owns and her land title is valid in all the countries she
owns.
Her main holdings are:
-
Canada, the 2nd largest country on earth, with
2,467 million acres
-
Australia, the 7th largest country on earth with 1,900
million acres
-
the Papua New Guinea with 114 million acres
-
New Zealand with
66 million acres
-
the UK with 60 million acres
She is the worlds largest landowner by a significant margin.
-
The next largest landowner is the
Russian state, with an overall ownership of 4,219 million acres, and
a direct ownership comparable with the Queens land holding of 2,447
million acres.
-
The 3rd largest landowner is the Chinese
state, which claims all of Chinese land, about 2,365 million acres.
-
The 4th largest landowner on earth is
the Federal Government of the United States, which owns about one
third of the land of the USA, 760 million acres.
-
The fifth largest landowner on earth is
the King of Saudi Arabia with 553 million acres
Largest five personal landowners on Earth:
-
Queen Elizabeth II - 6,600 million acres
-
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia - 553
