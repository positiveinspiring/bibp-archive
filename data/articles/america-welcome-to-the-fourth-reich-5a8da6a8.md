We, the heirs of the Third Reich,
have been an integral part of the American
Government
since Patton crossed the Rhine.

American Fascism did not start with World War II.
Before
Operation Paperclip, the codename under
which the US intelligence and military services extricated scientists from
Germany, during and after the final stages of the conflict, the annals of
internal despotism were well established. With the open door policy for
German engineering, the political ideology of state worship was bound to
travel across the Atlantic.
The Pampas of Argentina or the backwaters of Paraguay were the preferred
location for those who openly professed their reprehensible loyalty to the
FÃ¼hrer principle. However, do not blame all those ex-Nazis for selecting the
shores of the Americas for their new domicile, their seeds were planted long
ago in the offices of Wall and Broad Streets.
Leni Riefenstahls
Triumph of the Will saga
shares more, than what one wants to admit, about the dark side of American
History.
Do not be confused. National Socialism is an abhorrent notion to most
Americans.
Nevertheless, the political foundation of that false ideology is
based upon pure Fascism forged in a marriage of the Corporate/State that
produces this demented offspring. The systematic destruction of the
essential purpose and motivation for the American Revolution is undeniable
with any objective examination of the regretful legacy of domestic tyranny.
This record of monocracy is one of a criminal class, as opposed to the iron
fist of a single man. If you belief this is an erroneous assessment,
consider the following chronicle.
From the beginning of the Republic, the Federalists conspired for the
illegal passage of their central government constitution in order to form a
competing world empire with their British cousins.
Their leader was
Alexander Hamilton, who championed making individual states subservient to
the original crony capitalists.
When the Father of our Country, George
Washington admonished about the dangers on entangling alliances, the world
was warned that the drive towards independent liberty was compromised under
this new Federal system.
When Andrew Jackson rallied frontier populism against the establishment
elites of his era, you had an opportunity to restore some of the former
glory of the Revolution of 1776. The conflict over the abolishment of the
National Bank symbolizes the eternal struggle that continues to this very
day.
The Manifest Destiny of the U.S.-Mexican War demonstrated just how far the
country strayed from the fundamental concept of independence from England.
The expansionistic campaign had more in common with the Crown than the
Boston Tea Party.
The early 19th century fascists looked to their next defender
Abraham
Lincoln, the lawyer for the railroad corporatist cabal and the worst of all
despotic presidents, to complete the task.
Mark Dankof cites Thomas DiLorenzos work in the article,
Lincoln in Fort
Sumter, False Flags, and The Empires Coming Crusade.
-
Myth #1: Lincoln invaded the South to free the slaves.
-
Myth #2: Lincolns war "saved the Union."
-
Myth #3: Lincoln championed equality and natural rights.
-
Myth #4: Lincoln was a defender of the Constitution.
-
Myth #5: Lincoln was a "great humanitarian" who had "malice toward none."
-
Myth #6: War was necessary to end slavery.
The significance of the War of Northern Aggression is that the principle of
independent sovereign states under the precepts of constitutional law died.
With the prevention of secession, the liberty of a voluntary union was
betrayed for the rule, under a loyalty oath, to an Amerikan Reich.
The next False Flag excuse was the Spanish-American War and the "Remember
the Maine!" slogan that pushed the country into a "Pacific Imperium".
Those NeoCons, like Senator John McCain, who revere Theodore Roosevelt as a model
for imperialist jingoism, draw their psychopathic lusts from the same
bloodline as Reinhard Heydrich and Heinrich Himmler.
World War I produced the infamous Woodrow Wilson internationalist treason.
No longer will America be a society governed by elected representatives. The
only coup to come out of his administration was won by
the banksters. The
fate of a proud people, sealed with the creation of,
..is the basis for the final destruction of the country
and the horrors that befell our nation in the last century.
World War II inflicted the Franklin D. Roosevelt curse that guaranteed the
imposition of socialism on the American people. How ironic that the Hitler
bogymans regime, the scourge of Western Civilization and the reason for
defending democracy, ultimately lead to similar collectivist policies, now
adopted in the United States.
Just look to the ignominious involvement of Prescott Bushs involvement with
the funding of Adolph Hitler.
Even FAUX news cannot hide the relationship in
Bush's Grandfather Directed Bank Tied to Man Who Funded Hitler.
"Prescott Bush was one of seven directors of Union Banking Corp., a New York
investment bank owned by a bank controlled by the Thyssen family, according
to recently declassified National Archives documents reviewed by The
Associated Press."
So what can and should a "reasonable man" conclude from these examples from
history?
The essential lesson is that the pristine fairy tale of the federal
governments noble role as defender of righteousness, that politicians want
to accept and often die for, is a fictional myth.
Power politics always serves the interests of the banking elites, who
control the political process, own the financial capital and manipulate the
media viewpoint of events. This reality is pure fascism.
You live under this
system, so grow up, and admit it... it is the lamentable truth.
Barry Soetoro, aka,
Barack Hussein Obama fits the fascist mold to the tee.
In the above video, Obama and Holder taking on Arizona's SB1070, the treachery of
his administration is evident.
The eradication of States Rights is standard
policy coming out of this Federal governance regime. The separation ethnic
dictates of the Nazi hooligans seem to contrast with the multicultural
amnesty immigration ordinances that the Holder DoJ office fosters.
However,
if you look closely, both share a parallel distain for the rights of
indigenous citizens.
The Third Reich wanted to export their undesirables, while the Fourth Reich
wants to destroy the natural citizenry by importing unwanted illegals. A
fair read of the
State of Arizona SB 1070 Bill indicates that individual
states are under attack from a federal tyranny in the same way that the
German people were subjugated by the Swastika.
Ian Gurney
offers this comparison:
"Now let's take a quick look at Germany in the 1930's and 40's as the Nazis
reared their ugly heads. Here was a country that was financially crippled
with a massive budget deficit owing billions of dollars to the rest of the
world. Just like the USA.
In the 1930's Germany was a country where the burning of the Reichstag,
engineered by Hitler and his henchmen, was used to create external enemies
and to exert internal control over the German people. Hitler then used the
media to lie, frighten and deceive the population, allowing a bunch of
vicious, extreme, right wing megalomaniacs to gain power. Just like the USA.
In the 1930's Hitler was surrounded by a group of unelected officials whose
sole objective was to take control of Germany for their own ends and with
the use of their military might, take control of the assets and prosperity
of other, weaker countries. Just like the USA.
In 1939 Hitler embarked on a series of pre-emptive attacks on sovereign
nations in the name of "freeing the people" of that country. Just like the
USA.
In 1940 the German hierarchy started building special "camps" or detention
centers in which to incarcerate and eventually execute those people
considered to be "against" their regime. Just like the USA."
The Fourth Reich did not originate with Operation Overcast, the initiate
name for Operation Paperclip.
The classic book
Fourth Reich of the Rich, by
Des Griffin deserves another read.
Mr. Griffin states,
"Some 150 years ago, in a speech at Springfield, Illinois, Abraham Lincoln
acknowledged the fact that,
"no foreign power or combination of foreign
powers could by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue
Ridge in a trial of a thousand years."
At what point then is the approach of
danger to be expected?
I answer, if it ever reach us it must spring up from
among us, it cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must
ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen we must live
through all time or die of suicide."
Are we committing national suicide? Webster's Dictionary (1828) defines
suicide as:
"Self murder; the act of designedly destroying one's own life."
For that to be true on a national scale, the decisions leading up to our
national self-destruction would, of necessity, have to be made by those who
govern the country Congress, or "the government."
Much of the German population was captivated by Hitler.
The "presstitute"
Goebbels media holds out Obama as a shining example. His manners are a
composition of every tyranny to grace the scorched earth of despotic
government.
Will the America public come to their senses and make war
against this Amerikana version of the Fourth Reich? You need not look for
the Boys from Brazil to find todays Nazis.
They do their business in New
York City, run their international institutes from London and order their
bombing from Washington, DC.
Sieg heil! to
the New World Order is the modern definition of national
suicide.
