Have you heard about the Presidential
Executive Order (PEO) that will shut down all communications, including
the Internet?
What could not be done by valid legislation
passed by Congress, in effect has been done by executive privilege fiat.
However, nowhere does the U.S. Constitution give one-man rule powers to any
president.
But,
-
What is the U.S. Constitution anymore?
-
Isnt it an old junk piece of paper
thats to be treated as if it were some pie-in-the-sky dream from
centuries back?
-
Havent you heard talk about revamping
it; bringing it up to date; or even scuttling it?
-
My, what will they think of next?
Coming up to speed on the current PEO obsession,
Barack
Hussein Obama has issued over 150 PEOs from January 22, 2009
until June 3, 2013.
It looks like Number 44 is getting his way. We
might as well do away with Congress and the Supreme Court. We could save a
bundle on high priced salaries, wouldnt you say? You can read Mr. Obamas
PEOs
here.
Isnt it interesting that the very first PEO, No. 13492, Mr. Obama executed
was on the day after he was inaugurated?
That ought to make one wonder,
What were we thinking when we elected a
person who does not want any of his personal information divulged?
So much for the transparency plank of his
presidential candidacy platform; it was nothing more than wet sawdust!
We have to question if his very first PEO precludes Mr. Obamas phones,
computers, and other personal information from the same surveillance every
U.S. citizen is subjected to? Good question?
Something most citizens probably do not know is that PEOs become hard
fast law once published in the Federal Register. Heres an example of
a published PEO.
No one - not the electorate, i.e., voters, Congress, or even the U.S.
Supreme Court - can challenge, ignore, or negate them.
So theoretically, can any president declare him-
or herself a little tin hat dictator, if he or she wants to? You betcha!
That fact alone should be the most sobering factor to consider whenever
pushing a voting machine lever. But, then civics lessons no longer are
taught in grade school or even at high school level; what a shame!
Can that omission be considered a dumbing down
technique, similar to fluoride in our drinking water?
So why did Mr. Obama issue that PEO? His
reasoning may have been that the government may need access to all our
telephones, computers, cable communications, etc. in the name of national
security. W-h-a-t? That sounds like verifiable police state activity,
wouldnt you say?
What that PEO really does is to empower the Department of Homeland
Security to have,
"the authority to seize private facilities
when necessary, effectively shutting down or limiting civilian
communications." [1]
Officially, that PEO is labeled "Assignment
of National Security and Emergency Preparedness Communications Functions"
executed Friday, July 6, 2012 - a day we all may live to regret in addition
to Election Day 2008.
Personally, this writer has another take on that PEO and it goes something
like this: In effect, its a perfect way to close down the alternate press
that has become a thorn in the side of oppressive governments everywhere,
just not in the USA.
Once they can disable communications exposing
their nasty little lies, secrets, and other crap that is carried on in the
name of their idea of democracy, then they have total control.
Total control: thats what,
-
Hitler (Germany)
-
Stalin (Russia)
-
Pol Pot (Cambodia)
-
Mao Zedong (China)
-
Castro (Cuba),
...and those of that ilk also seized.
If you dont know about those power grabbers,
maybe you should check out some history books.
-
How can that same police state activity
be happening here in the United States of America?
-
Was what happened during the Boston
Marathon a preview?
-
When do totalitarian hardships and
genocide kick in, is the next question we ought to be pondering?
RT news website blares, "Obama
gives himself control of all communication systems in America."
All the above said, this writer has to wonder who really is pulling the
strings on the puppets and marionettes who are regarded as world leaders.
According to Winston Lord, a former
Council on Foreign Relations president,
The
Trilateral Commission doesnt run the
world, the
Council on Foreign Relations does
that!
So what do some of the CFR members have to say
about us, the two-legged creatures of the world?
None other than
Henry
Kissinger, says this:
But the one quote that really gets this writers
attention is what
Zbigniew Brzezinski said:
These new and old major powers face still
yet another novel reality - in some respects, unprecedented.
And it is that while the lethality, the
lethality, of their power is greater than ever, their capacity to impose
control over the politically awakened masses of the world is at a
historic low.
To put it rather bluntly, and I was
flattered that the British foreign secretary repeated this, as follows:
namely, in earlier times, it was easier to control a million people than
physically to kill one million people; today, it is infinitely easier to
kill a million people than to control a million people.
When will the masses finally wake up?
