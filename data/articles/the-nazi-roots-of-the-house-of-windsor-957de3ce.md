One of the biggest public relations hoaxes ever
perpetrated by the British Crown, is that King Edward VIII, who
abdicated the throne in 1938, due to his support for the Nazis, was a "black
sheep,'' an aberration in an otherwise unblemished Windsor line. Nothing
could be further from the truth.
The British monarchy, and the City of London's
leading Crown bankers, enthusiastically backed Hitler and the Nazis,
bankrolled the Führer's election, and did everything possible to build the
Nazi war machine, for Britain's planned geopolitical war between Germany and
Russia.
Support for Nazi-style genocide has always been at the heart of House of
Windsor policy, and long after the abdication of Edward VIII,
the Merry Windsors maintained their direct Nazi links.
So, when Prince Philip, co-founder with Prince Bernhard of the
Netherlands of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), tells an
interviewer that he hopes to be "reincarnated as a deadly virus'' to help
solve the "population problem,'' he is just "doing what comes naturally''
for any scion of the Anglo-Dutch oligarchy.
To get beyond the soap opera stuff and truly understand the Windsors today,
it is useful to start with Prince Philip. Not only was he trained in the
Hitler Youth curriculum, but his German brothers-in-law, with whom he lived,
all became high-ranking figures in the Nazi Party.
Before his family was forced into exile, Prince Philip had been in line of
succession to the Greek throne, established after a British-run coup against
the son of King Ludwig of Bavaria, who became King Otto I of the
Hellenes. Having dispatched King Otto in 1862, London ran a talent search
for a successor, which resulted in the selection of Prince William, the son
of the designated heir and nephew to the Danish king, Crown Prince
Christian.
In 1862, Prince William of the Danes was
installed as King George I of Greece, and married a granddaughter of Czar
Nicholas I in 1866. Prince Philip is a grandson of Queen Victoria, and he is
related to most of the current and former crowned heads of Europe, including
seven czars.
The marriages of Prince Philip's sisters definitely strengthened the German
aristocratic ties.
During 1931-1932, Philip's four older sisters
married as follows:
-
Margarita to a Czech-Austrian prince
named Gottfried von Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a great-grandson of
England's Queen Victoria
-
Theodora to Berthold, the margrave of
Baden
-
Cecilia to Georg Donatus, grand duke of
Hesse-by-Rhine, also a great-grandson of Queen Victoria
-
Sophie to Prince Christoph of Hesse
Three of Philip's brothers-in-law were part of a
group of German aristocrats who were Anglophile and pro-Nazi at the same
time, and who remain a subversive force in Germany to this day.
Enter Prince Bernhard
His Royal Highness Prince Bernhard, royal consort to Queen Juliana of
the Netherlands and father of the current Queen Beatrix, co-founded and
became the first head of the World Wildlife Fund (now the World
Wide Fund for Nature) in October 1961. When the Lockheed scandal forced
Prince Bernhard to resign from his most important public functions in 1971,
he was replaced by Prince Philip.
Prince Bernhard, like Prince Philip, whom he
recruited to the eco-fascist cause, had strong roots in the Nazi movement.
In fact, the whole House of Orange did:
-
Queen Wilhelmina, mother of the future
Queen Juliana, married a right-wing playboy who begged for money for
Hitler
-
Juliana married an SS man (Prince
Bernhard)
-
Queen Juliana's daughter Beatrix married
a former member of Hitler Youth
Prince Bernhard first became interested in the
Nazis in 1934, during his last year of study at the University of Berlin. He
was recruited by a member of the Nazi intelligence services, but first
worked openly in the motorized SS. Bernhard went to Paris to work for the
firm
IG Farben, which pioneered Nazi
Economics Minister Hjalmar Schacht's slave labor camp system by building
concentration camps to convert coal into synthetic gasoline and rubber.
Bernhard's role was to conduct espionage on
behalf of the SS. According to the April 5, 1976 issue of Newsweek,
this role, as part of a special SS intelligence unit in IG
Farbenindustrie, had been revealed in testimony at the Nuremberg trials.
When Bernhard left the SS to marry the future Queen Juliana, he signed his
letter of resignation to Adolf Hitler, "Heil Hitler!''
William Hoffman writes in his book
Queen Juliana:
"Tensions [over the marriage] were not
cooled when ... Adolf Hitler forwarded his own congratulatory message.
The newspaper Het Volk editorialized that 'it would be better if the
future Queen had found a consort in some democratic country rather than
in the Third Reich.'''
This is the man who recruited Prince Philip to
eco-facism, but Prince Philip's Nazi roots had been laid much earlier.
Hitler Youth and
Universal Fascism
Through the influence of his sister Theodora, young Philip was sent to the
German school near Lake Constantine that had been founded by Berthold's
father, Max von Baden, working through his longtime personal secretary,
Kurt Hahn.
During World War I, Prince Max von Baden
had been chancellor, while the Oxford-trained Hahn first served as head of
the Berlin Foreign Ministry's intelligence desk, then as special adviser to
Prince Max in the Versailles Treaty negotiations. Von Baden and Hahn set up
a school in a wing of Schloss Salem, employing a combination of monasticism
and the Nazis' "strength-through-joy'' system.
At first a supporter of the Nazis, Hahn, who was
part Jewish, soon got into trouble with the SS, and came to support the more
centrist elements of the Nazi Party. What Hahn really had become is what
Henry Kissinger's friend, Michael Ledeen has termed a "universal fascist,''
in the sense of Vladimir Jabotinsky, Count Coudenhove-Kalergi, the Strasser
brothers, and other fascists whom the hard-core Nazis would have no dealings
with.
Although Hahn's powerful connections permitted him to escape the
concentration camps, he was forced to leave the school he founded in Germany
before Philip's arrival there, and established a new school in Scotland,
called Gordonstoun.
It would play a major role in rearing all the
male children of Queen Elizabeth II and Philip. When Philip
arrived at Hahn's school in Schloss Salem, it was in control of the Hitler
Youth and the Nazi Party, and the curriculum had become Nazi "race
science.''
Hahn became an adviser to the Foreign Office in
London, urging policies of appeasement based upon appeals to the "centrist''
Nazis.
Philip's Relatives
Work for the SS
The husband of Philip's sister Sophie, Prince Christoph, was embraced by the
Nazis, who saw him as a channel to the appeasement faction in Britain
epitomized by King Edward VIII. Joining the Nazi Party in 1933, by 1935
Prince Christoph was chief of the Forschungsamt (directorate of
scientific research), a special intelligence operation run by Hermann
Göring, and he was also Standartenführer (colonel) of the SS on
Heinrich Himmler's personal staff.
The Forschungsamt used electronic
intelligence-gathering methods to police the Nazi Party, while working with
the Gestapo against the Catholic Church, the Jews, and labor organizations.
When rumors of homosexuality spread against Capt. Ernst Roehm of the
Stormtroopers, Himmler turned to the Forschungsamt's
eavesdroppers, and ordered the "Night of the Long Knives'' as a result.
The eldest of Prince Christoph and Sophie's
children was named Karl Adolf, after Hitler.
Later, Prince Philip would promote his
education.
Prince Christoph's brother, Philip of Hesse, married a daughter of the King
of Italy, and became the official liaison between the Nazi and Fascist
regimes.
Four years after Prince Philip left Schloss Salem to attend Gordonstoun
Academy in Scotland, on Nov. 16, 1937, Philip learned that his sister
Cecilia and her husband Georg Donatus, hereditary grand duke of Hesse-by-Rhine,
had crashed in one of Göring's Junker aircraft on a trip to London for
Georg's brother's wedding.
According to the British magazine Private Eye,
the funeral became a gathering point for leading Nazis and their appeasers.
Prince Philip himself developed secretive ties with King Edward VIII,
continuing after Edward was deposed in 1938.
In fact, one of the central figures in the 1930s Nazi-British back-channel
was Philip's uncle and sponsor, Lord Louis Mountbatten (originally,
Battenberg, a branch of the House of Hesse). Until he was forced to
abdicate, King Edward VIII enjoyed the full backing of "Dickie''
Mountbatten.
Through much of World War II, secret channels of
communication were maintained between the British royal family and their
pro-Hitler cousins in Germany, by Lord Mountbatten, through his sister
Louise, who was crown princess of pro-Nazi Sweden. Louise was Prince
Philip's aunt.
Although Buckingham Palace's rumor mill has tried to depict this wartime
collaboration with the enemy as mere family correspondence, the channel
apparently included messages from Prince Philip's secret ally, the Duke of
Windsor (the former Edward VIII).
On Nov. 20, 1995, the Washington Times
reported, based on recently discovered Portuguese Secret Service files
first published in the London Observer, that the Duke of Windsor had been in
close collaboration with the Nazis in Spain and Portugal to foment a
revolution in wartime Britain, that would topple the Churchill government,
depose his brother King George VI, and allow him to regain the throne, with
Queen Wallis [Simpson, the American divorcée, for whom he abdicated the
throne] at his side.
Portuguese surveillance revealed that Walter
Schellenberg, head of Gestapo counterintelligence, was one point of
contact in this plot. After Schellenberg met with the Spanish ambassador to
Portugal, Nicolás Franco, brother of fascist Gen. Francisco Franco,
Ambassador Franco told a Portuguese diplomat:
"The Duke of Windsor, free from the
responsibilities of the war, in disagreement with English politicians,
could be the man to put at the head of the Empire.''
Whatever correspondence was hidden in Sophie and
Prince Christoph's Kronberg Castle, King George VI, in June 1945, felt
compelled to dispatch the former MI-5 officer turned "Surveyor of the King's
Pictures,'' Anthony Blunt, to gather up the correspondence.
Queen Elizabeth II reportedly insisted that
there be no interrogation of Blunt about his secret trip to the castle.
Otherwise, it is notable that starting with an
exchange between King George VI and President Eisenhower, the
House of Windsor has been desperate to keep classified those
documents from Kronberg Castle that fell into American Army hands,
long beyond the normal length of time.
Clearly, Prince Philip's patron Lord Dickie
Mountbatten, Mountbatten's sister Crown Princess Louise, and Philip's
brother-in-law Prince Christoph of Hesse were not just exchanging Christmas
greetings.
