The Admiralty Court Exists Because
the
U.S. is Under Martial law
Did
you know the U.S. has a Military and a Civil Flag?
This Awareness indicates
that when Lincoln was assassinated, no one thought to put an end to this declaration
of martial law because of the Civil War and because the martial law has continued
up to this time, from the time of the Civil War, the nation can be directed
by what is called Admiralty Law or martial law by simply a command of the
President or the authority of the land or his agents.
"A country cannot be both ignorant and free..."

Under Martial Law - War and The Emergency Powers
For example, they may find that a
crisis lets them circumvent rules or laws that are protected by Constitutional
principles so that they break the Constitution by following procedures in
the activity of a disguise of helping out in a crisis. The emergency acts
often set aside laws and once a law is set aside for an emergency, it may
be left sitting aside.
For example, Abraham Lincoln declared
martial law during the Civil War. Martial law has not been lifted yet from
his declaration of martial law, over a hundred years ago. This Awareness indicates
that any time entities in power want to do something that is illegal under
the Constitution, they go simply ahead with it under the principle of the
martial law declared by Lincoln. That is how the Executive Orders are presented.
They are Executive Orders based on martial law that has not been lifted. This
is also referred to as admiralty law.
Thus you have, in one period,
a war on poverty. A few years later you have a war on drugs. And there are
more and more of these wars occurring every two years. Otherwise, Martial
Law would have to be canceled and you would be back under the Constitution,
and your freedoms could be restored. You could then plead Constitutional Rights
in courts of law. However, at present, the courts of law are following Admiralty
Law, and therefore, if you plead Constitutional Rights in court, you are not
likely to get anywhere.
Since
March 9, 1933, the United States has been in a state of declared national
emergency. In fact, there are now in effect four presidentially-proclaimed
states of national emergency: In addition to the national emergency declared
by President Roosevelt in 1933, there are also the national emergency proclaimed
by President Truman on December 16, 1950, during the Korean conflict, and
the states of national emergency declared by President Nixon on March 23,
1970, and August 15, 1971.

Ooooops....and
here comes for your entertainment "A Letter
to the Sheeple"
Thus Constitutional Rights
only count when you get up into the Supreme Court, for there is a tendency
to continue to use the Constitutional law in the Supreme Court because they
do not want the people to know that the Constitution has been superseded by
Admiralty Law. This Awareness indicates
that therefore, the Supreme Court will often rule if there is a constitutional
discrepancy, so that the lower laws are supposed to follow the Constitution,
and yet, entering into a court of law, arguing with the Constitution, seldom
is beneficial to an entity because they will say the entity is in the wrong
jurisdiction in this court.
They do not recognize your Constitutional
Law in the jurisdiction of an Admiralty setting or court, and therefore, they
will rule against you, This is the purpose of lawyers. They are clearly aware
of their role in the Admiralty court, because you are not in the right jurisdiction
for such.
American Patriot Friends Network:
The admiralty law, like any military law, has its own set of rules. This Awareness indicates it is also likened unto a corporation, which has its rules or laws, and when the laws of a corporation affect an entity in a way that is contrary to his or her Constitutional laws, then the entity can sue the corporation and rely on the Constitution, but this is often ignored by the corporations and most entities do not have the funds necessary to follow through to sue a corporation in order to have the Constitutional rights adjudicated.
The
Federal Government in D.C. a Corporation from England
This Awareness indicates
that likewise, the corporation that is the Federal government in Washington
D.C., which was incorporated in the last century in London, England, which
the Freeman have pointed out has its rules; these are the Federal statutes
and so forth; and these too are designed for certain purposes but are required
to follow the Constitution and if entities feel their Constitutional Rights
have been violated by a Federal statute, they have the option of suing the
Federal government and the statute for a constitutional ruling in the Supreme
Court.
This Awareness indicates
however, the ability to follow a case through the Supreme Court to test a
Federal statute is not always easy, nor is it inexpensive. It is very costly,
and very difficult and may take years. This Awareness indicates that for these
reasons, the Federal statutes are extremely difficult for entities to overrun,
and by carrying on the martial law in this country and using the Federal statutes
as law, the Constitution becomes less and less effective, because it becomes
more and more expensive to use, and therefore, gradually, over periods of
time, more and more statutes and more and more corporate rules had their effect
over the masses to the point where entities begin to feel that they do not
have any rights, and whereby even judges in courts of law dismiss and refuse
to allow constitutional points of law to occur in their courts.
The
Judicial System is Really to Protect the D.C. Corporation
Why should they allow constitutional
points of law in their courts when they are actually military courts? This
Awareness indicates that most entities think the judicial system is there
to protect the rights of entities according to the Constitution, the law of
the land, the Bill of Rights and so forth, but they are really there
to keep order in society and to protect those who have the power and the money
and to assure that no one disturbs the infrastructure of the corporation being
promoted from London or the state rules and those that are promoted by the
courts as military organizations.
Courts Are Above The Constitution?
Queen Elizabeth controls and has amended U.S. Social Security
THE UNITED STATES IS STILL A BRITISH COLONY
The Press Works for those Who Promote the New World
Order
This Awareness indicates
the press of course works for the people who bring you the New World Order,
who bring you the means by which this country will eventually be enslaved,
and the press ins not going to promote clear and honest reporting on
these kind of of issues. There are things from the Internet, that give some
clear reporting. This Awareness indicates that in general, however, most people
will only receive what the world planners want them to know, and therefore,
they are not likely to get the full story.
A
stroke of a Pen Could Create Martial Law
This Awareness indicates
that this could occur at the stroke of a pen when the Constitution is discarded
under martial law, which could occur any day that it is decided. This Awareness
indicates that as soon as the people are disarmed, the martial law that has
been in existence in this country since Lincoln will be publicly exposed and
people will realize they no longer can use Constitutional claims, freedom,
rights, and so forth, as a defense, and that they have no right to bear arms,
they have no right to congregate, they have no freedom of speech, they have
no rights in the courts of law to a fair trial by their peers.
In other words the Federal
government does not want the people to know yet they are under martial law,
or that they are not protected by the Constitution for fear that if they were
to discover this, it could start a civil war directed at the Federal government
from this army of 70 million people, for there are only 3 million armed people
in the military and police force in this country at this time.

"Government"
working for the Rothschilds
(Revelations of Awareness 94-8)
This Awareness
indicates that in a country where freedom of speech and other freedoms are
allowed, entities have been killed for expressing or pursuing those freedoms.
It is because this country is out of control in terms of the type of government,
and who the government really is working for, because this government has
not been working for the people for some time.
It has been working for
the Rothschilds
and other international bankers in their effort to create a New World Government,
run by
the United Nations, which is a Rothschild organization, which is an
international banking organization. It is basically owned by the international
bankers, established by them, set up by them, and influenced and basically
controlled by them..
On
Timarchy and the Usurper's Machineries
This Awareness
indicates that it is time for the people to reclaim their inalienable rights
that were given to them by the Divine, and handed to them through laws of
the United States Constitution, the Magna Carta, and other documents from
antiquity and historical situations wherein mankind fought, suffered, and
died to win these freedoms.
Government's
"Crime Prevention"-
This Awareness
indicates in other words, the government has gotten into Crime prevention,
by making the planning or the attempt to cause a crime a crime in itself.
This Awareness indicates that this is also part of the reasoning behind the
anti-gun movement, in which government sees that anyone having a gun, wherein
the Constitution gives entities the right to bear arms, the government is
saying:
"If we take away the guns, they cannot commit the crime, thus
it is Crime Prevention. If we make it a crime to have the guns, then we make
it a crime in a way that prevents crime from occurring."
Thus, getting into Crime Prevention
may go against the Constitution of the United states, but it would be to the
benefit of the New World Order to be able to call any kind of potential violence
a crime. They could even go further and restrict knives or bows and arrows,
but this is not likely to occur. The ownership of bows and arrows however
might eventually become a crime, because generally bows and arrows would be
considered potentially violent in their use.
This Awareness
indicates in other words, by creating a set of laws to prevent an entity from
having the ability to commit a crime, is making it so that entities do not
have to take responsibility for themselves. They only obey and are taken care
of by the government and its laws. The Constitution put the burden on the
individual to be a good citizen, whereas the New World Order is putting the
burden on the individual to give up freedoms and to obey the government and
its statutes and laws that do not guarantee freedoms.
This Awareness
indicates the Constitution was concerned about the judgments and laws of King
George and of government itself, and made it such that the people were in
charge of the government. The Constitution was there to serve the people against
an unruly tyrannical government to ensure that the government would never
be able to set up a totalitarian control over the masses.
This has more or less neutralized,
negated, and made obsolete, though they still pretend the Constitution has
power. The agencies, particularly the Justice Branch of government and the
executive Branch have total control over the people at this time. If a case
is brought to a courthouse anywhere in the United States, and an entity attempts
to use the Constitution as the arguments for protection, they will get nowhere
in the effort, because the courts are not operating under the Constitution.
They are operating under martial law, and as continued to the present.

confiscate
the guns from U.S. citizens
