We want to share insights into the formation of a new social movement as it
is still taking shape in real time.
The video was shot during the 5th and 6th day of the occupation.
This idea to occupy the financial district in New York City was inspired by
recent uprisings in,
-
Spain
-
Greece
-
Egypt
-
Tunisia,
...which most of us were
following online.
Despite of the corporate media's effort to silence the protests, and Yahoo's
attempt to to censor it in e-mail communication, the occupation is growing
in numbers and spreading to other cities in the US and abroad.
Please
forward our video to likeminded people via Email, Facebook, Twitter - and
make the voices of dissent circulate.
