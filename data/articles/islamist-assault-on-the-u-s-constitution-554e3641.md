This past weekend, a fanatical Islamist group,
Hizb ut Tahrir, which calls itself a "Global Islamic Political Party,"
convened at the Hilton Hotel in Chicago in order to rally the jihadi
troupes
to overthrow the U.S. Constitution and to impose Islamic sharia law,
with all its oppression, brutality and censorship.
In the first place, the double standard held by hotels lately is blatant:
The conference featuring Islam critic and Dutch politician Geert Wilders
in Florida was cancelled at the last minute after the Delray Beach Marriott
hotel refused to hold it.
We know the culprits behind that piece of
censorship. Now, however, we find individuals essentially attempting to
conquer the U.S. given free rein at another hotel.
The U.S. Constitution
If these individuals calling for the destruction
of the U.S. Constitution are American citizens, they have basically
committed treason and should be charged with that crime.
If they are not
American citizens, they should be deported as soon as possible.
How long would such anti-government rabble
rousers have lasted in Saudi Arabia or Iran, calling for the destruction of
the constitutions there?
Free Speech is Sacred
Secondly, availing themselves of the First Amendment these anti-American
fanatics in Chicago were evidently carrying signs declaring, Freedom of
Speech is an Attack on Islam.
Many people outside of the Muslim world hold
free speech as a sacred tenet; hence, the censorial commentary itself
represents an attack on their religion. These same individuals cherish the
U.S. Constitution as a
truly sacred scripture.
Regarding this gathering, American Atheists president Ed Buckner
remarked:
"The enemy they cite is free markets, free
ideas, and freedom from imposed religion
We know that is not what most
Americans want, including, we hope and think, the vast majority of
Muslims who, while religious, accept the values embodied in the
Constitution, including free expression.
We can only hope that the majority of Muslims in
the U.S. revere the freedoms that the American Constitution
affords - including freedom from imposed religion - and that, rather than
committing treason, they will uphold and defend that sacred piece of
legislation.
However, we must keep in mind the chilling
example of creeping sharia in the U.K. and other parts of Europe, and we
must never lose sight of the old adage widely ascribed to American Founding
Father and President Thomas Jefferson:
"The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
Patriotic Old Lady
Immigrants Make American Flags
Let us never forget the steep price so many
Americans have paid over the past centuries in order to establish and
preserve those freedoms. And let us also never capitulate our hard-earned
right to free speech, which we may claim as one of our religious tenets.
Indeed, such censorship constitutes an attack on basic human rights that we
as freethinkers hold sacred.
Our future generations are depending on us.
