As citizens around the world endure Internet
censorship of all types, a Japanese university has stepped in to level the
playing field.
Whether youre in Iran or China and blocked from YouTube,
Twitter or Facebook, or in the UK desperate to get back on The Pirate Bay,
KAT or H33T, a new tool from researchers gives instant access to dozens of
VPN services. Not only is the system simple to use, but its also completely
free.
No matter which country you live in there are
always people in authority seeking to limit which websites youre able to
view.
Admittedly some sites are quite rightly deemed
repulsive to society in general and 99% of the public have few problems with
them being hidden away. However, the blocking of normal sites is much more
controversial.
China is infamous for its Great Firewall and its
censorship of anything it pleases from Twitter to YouTube. Iran also has
concerns that its citizens minds will be influenced by Western thinking via
the web. Overall, oppressive regimes tend to see some websites as having a
destabilizing effect, so they censor them to maintain control.
In recent times the notion of website blocking
has become fashionable in the West too, mainly because certain domains are
viewed as offensive to the music and movie industries. The Pirate Bay is
blocked in many countries and just this week the UK added another
three sites to its ISPs filters - KAT.PH, H33T and Fenopy.
But, as mentioned countless times in the past,
these filters represent mere temporary roadblocks for the determined and
today we bring news of an exciting project that allows almost anyone to
access any site they like in seconds.
Best of all, it takes just a few
minutes to setup and its completely free.
The Graduate School of University
of Tsukuba, Japan, has just launched the VPN Gate Academic Experiment
Project with the aim,
to expand the knowledge of Global Distributed Public VPN Relay Servers.
Were very happy to help them with that today.
How it works
Volunteers have given the University access to
dozens of VPN servers located all over the world which people can access
from pretty much any device running Windows,
Linux, iOS, Android and more.
No sign up or user registration is needed.
Once connected the users IP address is hidden and switched for one issued
by the VPN of their choice selected from dozens around the world.
Protocols and the
SSL-VPN client
Several protocols are accepted, such as L2TP/IPsec,
SSTP and the popular OpenVPN, but things get really streamlined for those
who select the SSL-VPN option.
This requires the
easy installation of
the Windows freeware client SoftEther
VPN but its straightforward and only takes a couple of minutes.
The beauty of running the client (which is also
developed by the University and will soon go open source) soon becomes
apparent. Not only does SoftEther offer SSL-VPN tunneling via HTTPS to pass
more easily through NATs and firewalls, it has another trick up its sleeve.
The client comes with a nifty pre-configured
plugin which displays a list of all the available VPN servers offered by VPN
Gate (see below). This enables the user to activate, disconnect, or switch
between VPNs with just a click.
This means that there is no need to set up
each VPN connection manually in an operating system, although that can be
done if the user prefers.
Unblock any site in an
instant
-
Want to unblock The Pirate Bay, KAT.PH or H33T
in the UK? Easy, just select any server that isnt in the UK and preferably
outside Europe.
-
Want to access YouTube in China? Simple, just access any
non-domestic VPN server.
-
US citizen who needs to use Hulu overseas? Fine,
just pick a United States server.
-
UK citzen who needs to access the BBC
iPlayer abroad? A UK server will provide the solution.
Once a server is selected and connected to the
client, simply use your regular browser and other Internet applications as
usual and traffic will be diverted through the VPN.
Tests
TorrentFreak carried out some basic tests
yesterday and got some decent results.
We successfully unblocked all of the
blocked torrent sites in the UK, accessed Hulu from outside the US, and
watched the BBC iPlayer and TVCatchup services from outside the UK.
Also, since the people at VPN Gate apparently
have no problem with people using the service for video transfers (they
mention YouTube specifically), we conducted some limited BitTorrent runs on
half a dozen servers around the world. In each case we connected to a VPN
server via the SoftEther Client and carried out tests with a service such
as TorrentIP to ensure that our IP address when using BitTorrent had
actually been changed.
All but one of our tested servers worked fine while
another appeared to block torrents.
Performance, logging and
offering your computer as a server
As might be expected, performance changed from
server to server but in each case browsing and transfer speeds were more
than acceptable for a free service. Each server shows its available
bandwidth so picking one with more tends to yield better results.
That said,
we tried a couple of slower ones and they performed just fine too.
While VPN Gate offers anonymity to a point, they
do keep connection logs for around three months. In common with most other
VPN services they do not monitor your activities but will comply when
ordered to do so by the local courts, in this case those in Japan.
However,
each VPN server has its own logging policy and many appear to delete logs
after a couple of weeks, if they keep them at all.
To give an outline of how the logging might
affect users in real-life situations, we can look at a few scenarios.
-
If a US citizen carried out file-sharing on a US
VPN server, he might be logged by those carrying out six strikes in the US.
However, if that same user selected a server overseas, he would not be
monitored by six strikes.
-
Equally, an Iranian or Chinese citizen looking to
carry out activities frowned upon by his or her government would be advised
to use servers located outside their respective countries.
-
Finally, please use the services responsibly
- respect the volunteers offering their services and consider becoming one
yourself.
