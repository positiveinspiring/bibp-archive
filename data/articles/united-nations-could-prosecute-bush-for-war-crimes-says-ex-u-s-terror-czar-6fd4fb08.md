Former U.S. terror czar Richard Clarke
(shown above), who resigned in 2003, dropped two bombshell statements about
the Bush administration he served during a recent TV interview.
First, he said, former President
George W.
Bush and then-Vice President
Dick Cheney
probably perpetrated what amounts to "war crimes"
surrounding the
unconstitutional attack on Iraq.
While plenty of Americans on all sides of the
political spectrum might be inclined to agree, Clarke went even further. He
suggested the duo could be prosecuted by the
dictator-dominated
United Nations at the global body's
self-styled "International Criminal Court" (ICC) in The
Hague.
Clarke was fairly blunt when asked whether he
thought war-crimes charges should be brought against Bush, Cheney, and
then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.
"I think things that they authorized
probably fall within the area of war crimes," the former U.S. terrorism
czar for Bill Clinton and George W. Bush
said in an interview (see far below
video) with Amy Goodman of the
'progressive' Democracy
Now TV program.
"Whether that would be productive or not, I
think, is a discussion we could all have." It was not immediately clear
why, if he believes they authorized war crimes, there should be a
"discussion" about whether justice is "productive."
Next, Clarke, listed as a "senior advisor" to
the globalist Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and whose formal title in the
U.S. administration was "national coordinator for security and
counterterrorism," suggested that the
UN's kangaroo "court" might play a role in such prosecutions.
"We have established procedures now with the
International Criminal Court in The Hague, where people who take actions
as serving presidents or prime ministers of countries have been indicted
and have been tried," Clarke said without hinting at the
ICC's illegitimate nature or the fact that the United States has
never agreed to participate in the widely criticized global "judicial"
regime.
Still, Bush's former terror czar insisted his
ex-boss could be prosecuted by the UN outfit.
"So the precedent is there to do that sort
of thing," continued Clarke, who is also affiliated with various extreme
leftist outfits such as the Center for American Progress.
"And I think we need to ask ourselves
whether or not it would be useful to do that in the case of members of
the Bush administration. It's clear that things that the Bush
administration did - in my mind, at least, it's clear that some of the
things they did were war crimes."
The irony, of course, is that Bush's
unconstitutional invasion and occupation of Iraq were carried out under a UN
"resolution" as opposed to a declaration of war issued by Congress, which
the U.S. Constitution requires.
Indeed, the Bush administration and its
"partners" in the war cited UN Security Council Resolution 1441, adopted
unanimously in 2002 by the 15-member global body, as justification.
The UN agreement - which can never
legitimately override the U.S. Congress's authority to declare war -
purported to mandate the disarmament of Iraqi tyrant Saddam Hussein,
a former U.S. government ally in the 1980s despite his use of weapons of
mass destruction.
Of course, it is hardly the first time Bush and
other senior U.S. officials - including Obama, who has taken Bush's
mass-murder-via-drone program to
deadly new heights - have been accused
of war crimes.
In 2012, a pseudo-international "court" in
Malaysia styling itself the "Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission" even
purported to "convict" Bush and seven other senior administration officials
of "war crimes" for invading Iraq.
Among those "convicted" in absentia were,
...as well as U.S. "legal advisers",
-
Alberto Gonzales
-
David Addington
-
William Haynes
-
Jay Bybee
-
John Yoo
The court was set up by former Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
Separately, as reported by the Huffington
Post, Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, former Secretary of State Colin
Powell's chief of staff, also accused Cheney of perpetrating war crimes.
"Waterboarding is a war crime, unwarranted
surveillance... all of which are crimes," Wilkerson said in 2011 in
arguing that the former vice president was a war criminal.
"I don't care whether the president
authorized him to do it or not, they are crimes."
Obviously, as demonstrated at Nuremberg,
following orders is not a valid excuse for perpetrating war crimes.
It is also not the first time that Clarke, who
served in high-level positions under numerous administrations, has
criticized Bush. Indeed, when it comes to Iraq, the ex-terror czar has been
a relentless critic since his resignation in 2003.
"The president wanted me, after the fact, to
blame Iraq for the 9/11 attack," Clarke said in the interview with
Democracy Now that aired last week.
He has also been deeply critical of the
administration for allegedly ignoring crucial information on al-Qaeda that
could have been important in stopping the
September 11 attacks.
Instead of focusing on real threats, Clarke
suggested the administration was too preoccupied with inventing
justifications to invade Iraq.
Clarke also
spoke out against some of the
Obama administration's abuses, particularly what he referred to
as,
a "kill committee" - "people who sit around
in the White House passing folders back and forth of names and voting on
who they're going to kill."
Former Counterterrorism Czar Richard Clarke:
U.S. Drone Program Under Obama "Got Out of Hand"
According to Clarke - not to mention any
semblance of constitutional or even merely civilized standards - such
schemes "went way too far."
He also criticized some of the National Security
Agency's "illegal" spying programs, which he said should be abolished.
Special criticism was reserved for the death-by-drone program, which,
ironically, Clarke played a role in getting off the ground.
Multiple estimates suggest that thousands of
innocent civilians have been massacred under the schemes. Clarke disagreed
with those figures, but acknowledged that "it is clearly too many."
Despite Bush's own well-documented disdain for
the U.S. Constitution, his God-given rights to a fair trial by a jury of his
peers, like the right of all Americans, must be respected - an impossibility
at the UN's kangaroo court.
Dr. Charles Rice, a professor of law at
Notre Dame University,
called the ICC "a monster" that essentially,
"repudiates the Constitution, the Bill of
Rights, and the Declaration of Independence and cancels the 4th of
July."
Especially troubling, he said, is that the court
acknowledges no boundaries to its supposed authority.
"In our system, law is supposed to be a rule
of reason which, in a sense, controls the state and compels the state to
operate under the law," Dr. Rice explained.
"What are the limits on the ICC? There are
none. It's insane!"
As such, if Bush and other senior officials are
ever charged with war crimes or other criminal charges, they must be
prosecuted in the United States under U.S. law in a real, legitimate court.
Of course, the Obama administration, which has
perpetrated numerous similar crimes, has worked fiendishly to protect
officials in the previous administration from prosecution for torture,
spying, war crimes, and more.
However, if justice is to be served, alleged
American war criminals may only be prosecuted in U.S. courts before a jury
of their peers.
Already, in 2011, the self-styled UN "court,"
which does not possess even a semblance of authority over Americans, claimed
to be "investigating"
U.S. forces.
Empowering the
despot-packed United Nations to operate its own pseudo-judiciary branch
would be a major mistake for many reasons that have been
outlined in this magazine for over a decade.
Allowing such a planetary "court" to prosecute
Americans would be an absolute disaster. They may start with alleged war
criminals, but that will undoubtedly not be the end.
The
Obama
administration and its globalist allies are working hard to
empower the ICC.
For the sake of liberty, the Constitution, and
national sovereignty, Americans and their representatives must work even
harder to stop it.
