The global elite
boldly advance their world government agenda
into Americas National Security Strategy.
Since Obama took office in 2009, political
analysts and mainstream media pundits have failed to accurately identify any
central ideology or grand strategy driving the administrations policies.
The governments National Security Strategy Report has been the most likely
place to find such a doctrine expressed officially, but when Obamas
administration issued their version in 2010, the mainstream media failed to
bring to light the real agenda conveyed in the document.
The establishment
medias general interpretation was that the strategy represented a shift
away from past policies of unilateralism, preemptive warfare, and military
preeminence, towards policies of greater cooperation with international
institutions.
But an independent examination of the report, along with some
of its guidelines now in operation, reveals that the documents primary
policy positions, while setting new precedents, are derived from an old,
deep rooted agenda for a world empire, propelled by elite finance oligarchs
and global corporatists.
The document centers around the building of a new
international order by overhauling, revitalizing and granting more
authority to international institutions including the IMF, WTO, NATO, G20,
the World Bank and especially the UN.
Decoding the 2010 National
Security Strategy
In May of 2010, during presentations introducing
and summarizing the new National Security Strategy Report, President Barack
Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke of shaping an
international order that would emphasize the role of global institutions in
national security policy.
While
speaking at
the Brookings Institute, Clinton listed this new international order as
one of the governments four central goals, saying,
Our approach is to build
the diverse sources of American power at home and to shape the global system
so that it is more conducive to meeting our overriding objectives: security,
prosperity, the explanation and spread of our values, and a just and
sustainable international order.
Obama had used similar language a few days
earlier at
West Point (below video) saying,
So we have to shape an international order that can
meet the challenges of our generation and The international order we seek
is one that can resolve the challenges of our times
Hearing the president speak of shaping a
new international order as part of Americas National Security Strategy
alarmed those in the
alternative media who
recognized the phrasing as a familiar reference to the Anglo-American
elites efforts at establishing a world empire or new world order.
The
mainstream media, however, made no connections to a long term elitist agenda
and instead framed the speech by contrasting Obamas new strategy with those
released under the Bush administration.
The Washington Post claimed that,
Obama pledged to shape a new
international order based on diplomacy and engagement which distanced
itself from the Bush Doctrine of preemptive warfare.
But when the document
was later released, its contents proved to justify the concerns of so called
conspiracy theorists.
Rather than simply promoting global cooperation or
representing a positive new direction in policy, the strategy is instead a
bold jump forward in the overarching, multi administration spanning agenda
of global finance oligarchs to construct a world government.
The fact that
this agenda has now openly emerged in Americas National Security Strategy
doctrine illustrates the advanced degree to which this scheme has progressed
outside public awareness, without any public discussion or debate.
The National Security Strategy Report (NSSR) is
the primary policy document, prepared by the executive branch, outlining an
administrations formulation of grand strategy for the country.
According to
the National Security Strategy Archive,
It is intended to be a comprehensive statement articulating the worldwide
interests, goals, and objectives of the United States that are important to
its security.
Involvement in the creation of the report is regarded by many
policy planners as "direct
access to the Presidents overall agenda and thus highly desirable.
Typically
its contents have been the responsibility of National Security Council staff
members, but influence has been proven to come from other sources as well.
Years after the 2002 NSSR was released, its
primary author was revealed to be Philip Zelikow, a former National
Security Council staffer under George Bush Sr. from 1989 to 1991.
Zelikow was
not a member of George W. Bushs administration at the time, but rather
worked as a consultant to his national security advisor Condoleezza Rice.
Long after the reports publication, he was discovered to be the secret
writer of its infamous preemptive (more accurately preventive) war policy,
earlier formulated by Paul Wolfowitz, which came to be known as the Bush
Doctrine.
These reports are responsible for the
implementation of long term policy directives that can extend far into
future administrations. Modern versions of the report have provided a
continuity to national security policy by only being produced every four
years in the middle of the presidential term, even though they are supposed
to be released every year.
According to the Goldwater-Nichols
Act,
The President shall transmit to Congress each year a comprehensive
report on the national security strategy of the United States, in a
classified and unclassified form.
The notorious Bush NSSRs were issued in
2002 and 2006. Obamas NSSR came in 2010 and the next NSSR will most likely
be released in the middle of 2014.
The unclassified version of the new National
Security Strategy was released to the public in late May of 2010 with
little controversy considering its alarming contents. (Screenshots of this
report and other sources have been provided, with added highlighting or
underlining, for quick reference.)
The document centers around the old and
familiar narrative of modern global crises requiring global solutions in the
form of a new international order.
This theme is introduced in the forward of
the report and repeated throughout, with the international order being
referenced more than 25 times in the 52 page document, including major
sections and
subsections devoted to it.
The following screenshots from page one
contain the documents opening paragraph summarizing the reports overview
and showing the central theme of the strategy to be the creation of this new
international order.
(screenshot below of NSSRs opening paragraph of
the overview on page 1)
(Screenshot below from 2010 NSSRs overview on
page 1)
While initial use of the phrase shape an
international order is purposefully broad, further examination of the
report clarifies its language of shape to be synonymous with create, and
is
used in the document interchangeably with the word build."
The
reports primary use of the term international order is not to generically
describe the existing international system or community, but rather to
denote a new world system or architecture, led by the United States.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described it as a new global
architecture that the administration has begun to build during a new
American moment in international affairs,
when our global leadership is
essential, even if we must often lead in new ways.
The NSSR uses the term international order in
the same way that the more controversial term new world order has been
used in the past to describe a system of global governance centered around
international institutions and organizations including the IMF, WTO, NATO,
G20, the World Bank and the UN.
Many high profile politicians have publicly
used the phrase in relation to these institutions, as a way to signal large
political changes in world affairs.
George Bush Sr. used the new world order
phrase repeatedly during his presidency,
stressing the role of the United Nations (below video) in creating a,
"new
world order where diverse nations are drawn together..."
In 1991, while
addressing the General Assembly of the UN, Bush explained
that the UN could offer new life to dormant institutions of freedom, saying,
These institutions play a crucial role in our quest for a new world order.
He then spoke of Americas role in the new world order, saying,
We will
offer friendship and leadership. And in short we seek a Pax Universalis
built upon shared responsibilities and aspirations.
He urged the assembly
to take the challenge seriously so that future generations could say about
the men and women of the UN that they,
built an era of peace and
understanding and inaugurated a new world order, an order worth preserving
for the ages.
The term seemed to fade into the background somewhat after
Bush received a backlash
of criticism for its
excessive use (below video).
Similarly, former UK Prime Minister Gordon
Brown, another avid proponent of
global governance, has
used the term publicly
numerous times (below video)
referring to this same system of institutions.
In a 2008 article out
of The Independent titled Transformed UN proposed to create new world
order, we read that,
Gordon Brown has begun secret talks with other world
leaders on far-reaching reform of the United Nations Security Council as
part of a drive to create a new world order and global society.
It goes
on to say,
He will call for the World Bank to lead the fight against climate
change as well as poverty in the developing world, and argue that the
International Monetary Fund should prevent crises like the credit crunch
rather than just resolve them.
Shortly after the 9/11 attacks,
devoted NATO proponent, CFR member, and former Colorado Senator, Gary
Hart suggested (below video) that, because of increased support for NATO, the crisis
could be used to further George Bush Sr.s new world order agenda.
Speaking before
the Council on Foreign Relations Hart
stated,
There is a chance for the
President of the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his
father
a phrase his father used I think only once, and hasnt been used
since
and that is a new world order. Think about this. We already have the
support of NATO in a remarkable historic departure.
In 2008 he argued that,
Unless we want to lose tens of millions of people to viral pandemics,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, climate change and a whole
host of other new realities, we will need a new international order.
Many other global elites, influential
politicians, and world leaders have referenced the term new world order in
relation to these institutions, including billionaire financier George
Soros.
When asked in 2009 what kind of financial deal Obama should seek to
strike while in China, Soros
answered (below video),
I think this would be the time because you really need to
bring China into the creation of a new world order.
He explains the need
arising from Chinas lack of contribution to the IMF and sees the makings
of the new world order already taking place with their involvement in the
G20′s current policies.
While avoiding the controversial term new world
order, Obamas NSSR 2010 makes clear that the international order his
administration is building is synonymous with the popular euphemism.
According to the document, this international order is to be created by
revamping the
system of international institutions founded after WWII, including the
UN, NATO, IMF, and the World Bank.
The new strategy aims to accomplish this
transformation by modernizing and engaging these international
institutions while strengthening their legitimacy and authority.
Under
the section titled Promoting a Just and Sustainable International Order
the report states that the new order will be tested by its ability to
facilitate cooperation and generate results using a variety of tools
including sanctions, isolation, and
force, to change the conduct of nations it deems to be non compliant.
(Screenshot below from 21010 NSSR pages 12,13)
(Screenshot below from 2010 NSSR page 13)
Obama Doctrine In Action
The document asserts that the administration is
building a new international order by
modernizing the existing international infrastructure into a new global
architecture by strengthening the institutions and granting them more
authority.
Here we can again clarify the broad language of the report; this
time with the added context of its implemented policies in the illegal
Libyan War of 2011. Just as the
Gulf War was considered by the establishment to be a
test of the New World Order under George Bush Sr., the Libyan War
served as a test for the new international order under Barack Obama.
In a
February 2011 article titled "Libyas Test of the New International Order" from the Brookings
Institute, we read that,
The current dangerous situation in Libya has become
a serious test for the international communitys resolve and credibility,
especially in the context of a changing Arab world. In particular, it is a
test of the ability of a much heralded multipolar new world order
Later,
as if to announce to the world that the operations in Libya were a showcase
for the Obama doctrine,
CNN featured a segment (below video) on the Libyan War prominently titled The New
World Order with a panel discussion between representatives of
establishment think tanks including the Council On Foreign Relations and the
Brookings Institute.
With the war in Libya, the Obama administration
was setting a new precedent. Just as directed by the 2010 NSSR, the U.N. was
given more authority, in this case more than Americas own Congress, when
Obama sent Speaker of the House John Boehner
a letter citing authority from the United Nations Security Council
alone as justification for military operations in Libya.
Later we saw
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Gen. Martin Dempseys
citation of international permission," (below video) rather than permission from
Congress, as the justification for military action in Syria.
It was again
suggested that the UN or NATO could provide the necessary legal basis for
U.S. military action and that Congress might only be informed of the
decision afterwards.
These examples cut to the heart of the primary
concerns among opponents of the new world order: that a countrys
assimilation into a global government would mean the loss of its national
sovereignty and the undermining of its constitution. While some proponents
openly admit that world government would necessarily involve the loss of
national sovereignty, many others claim that the concern is unfounded.
However, we can see for ourselves in Libyas test of the new international
order, that one of the most significant and critical aspects of a nation
states government, the act of waging war, is being further removed from the
control and consent of the common American citizen.
In this case the
sovereignty of both countries was violated, as the UN was used by the
establishment to disregard and supersede the US Congress while promoting and
justifying the use of force by military intervention in Libya.
The leading pretext among the propaganda
used to justify the Libyan War was that of humanitarian intervention. This
aspect of the Obama Doctrine appears to be largely drawn from the UNs R2P
doctrine or Responsibility to Protect which
is cited in the 2010 NSSR (figure 1 below).
The Responsibility to Protect policy is
used to disguise the imperial
use of force (figure 2 below) with humanitarian rhetoric.
The actual realities of the
war, being anything but humanitarian, reveal the hypocritical nature of the
policys implementation, and with all its rhetoric of cooperation with
international institutions, the 2010 NSSR still retains the right to unilateral use of force.
(figure 3 below.)
Obama Doctrine At Home
While the Libyan War was a clear implementation
of guidelines set in the 2010 NSSR, determining exactly what other policies
from the document are being transmitted and put into action is more
difficult.
The document is intended to be a broad comprehensive outline of
policy, so it is very vague and general to begin with. Another layer of
vagueness is added due to it being an unclassified version of the strategy;
not necessarily designed for the public, but rather designed to withstand
public scrutiny.
Add to this surreptitious composition the systems tactic
of hiding its true intentions behind euphemistic propaganda, and the
document becomes rather cryptic, requiring much added context to decipher
its true essence and aims.
Because the controlled mainstream media often
work as public relations organizations for the government and elite, the job
of interpreting documents like the NSSR to determine what its implementation
will entail is left to the alternative media and the general public.
Along with R2P we can expect to see more UN
programs, like Agenda 21 and Codex Alimentarius, being enforced in the US,
as the elite further strengthen and engage these institutions of global
governance.
The rhetoric of food security and sustainable development, seen
in the NSSR (below image), is the commonly used jargon of
Codex Alimentarius
and Agenda 21 to hide their policies of corporate domination, population
control and social engineering, in the same way that the humanitarian
rhetoric of R2P is used to disguise the imperialistic use of force.
Under
these programs the peoples legitimate concerns for the environment and
global health are co-opted and turned against them as they lose their rights
to control their own property, their freedom to choose alternative and
natural medicines and their access to clean, healthy foods.
Obamas
Executive Order #13575, establishing the White House Rural Council in 2011,
is very much
in the vein of UN Agenda 21, as the government aims to seize more power
over rural America and takes greater control over food and energy
production.
Policies like the
2010 Food Safety Modernization Act," featured a huge expansion of FDA
power and a plan with,
Recommendations on whether and how to harmonize
requirements under the Codex Alimentarius.
When the NSSR
promises to,
pursue potential game changers for development such as
new vaccines, weather-resistant seed varieties, and green energy
technologies, we can assume that big pharma and bio-tech corporations like
Monsanto will be the primary beneficiaries.
Along with many other examples
of these policies in action, we saw
in 2012, that the USDA approved field trials of Monsanto
drought-resistant corn without even conducting a legitimate environmental
risk analysis.
The co-opting of the environmental movement
extends to the policies surrounding climate change, a major motivation and
justification behind Agenda 21.
The
NSSRs section dealing with climate change states that,
The danger from
climate change is real, urgent, and severe.
Among the efforts discussed to
deal with this issue the report states,
Globally, we will seek to implement
and build on the Copenhagen Accord
The section also lists as a goal that,
the necessary financing is mobilized so that developing countries can adapt
to climate change
Among the many agendas behind the 2009 Copenhagen
Summit, the UNs Secretary General Ban Ki-moon openly admitted that
developing a world government structure was one of the most
important.
Referring to commitments made in the Copenhagen Treaty, the
Secretary General
said in an interview with the L.A. Times,
We will establish a global
governance structure to monitor and manage the implementation of this.
He
also wrote in an editorial for
the New York Times, that a comprehensive, equitable and ambitious deal
in Copenhagen must include an equitable global governance structure.
In 2010 The Guardian obtained a confidential document revealing,
the US
governments increasingly controversial strategy in the global UN climate
talks.
Outlining the key messages the Obama administration wanted to convey
in the run up to the UN climate talks later that year, the documents number
one listed objective was to,
Reinforce the perception that the US is
constructively engaged in UN negotiations in an effort to produce a global
regime to combat climate change. This includes support for a symmetrical and
legally binding treaty.
After the Copenhagen summit, the media misled the
public by portraying the final agreement as a failure, while the final
text of the accord accomplished its goal of establishing the framework
for a global government with the ability to impose taxes for funding.
The elites efforts to shape a North
American Union (NAU) by combining US, Mexico, and Canada, seem to be
hinted at in the NSSRs section concerning North America.
While
discussing NAFTA and using the associated NAU buzzwords of security,
prosperity, and partnership, the NSSR informs us that,
We must change the
way we think about our shared borders, in order to secure and expedite the
lawful and legitimate flow of people and goods while interdicting
transnational threat that threaten our open societies.
Modeled after the
EU, the NAU has been organized in stealth through trade deals, treaties, and
region-level agreements like NAFTA and the Security and Prosperity
Partnership (SPP).
In 2011 Obama implemented a key initiative of the SPP
by signing the declaration titled Beyond the Border: A Shared Vision
for Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness.
The continental
perimeter created by the declaration partially reveals what the NSSR meant
by,
We must change the way we think about our shared borders.
Using the
direct language of the NSSR report, the declarations preamble states,
we
intend to pursue a perimeter approach to security, working together within,
at, and away from the borders of our two countries to enhance our security
and accelerate the legitimate flow of people, goods, and services between
our two countries.
Obama also signed Executive Order 13563, Improving
Regulation and Regulatory Review in 2012, in an effort to facilitate North
American integration by
harmonizing US regulations with foreign ones."
We might also interpret in the NSSRs foggy
language, a foreshadowing of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA)
provision concerning the indefinite detention of American citizens.
In the
section titled Legal Aspects of Countering Terrorism
the report states that,
The increased risk of terrorism necessitates a
capacity to detain and interrogate suspected violent extremists
and for
detainees who cannot be prosecuted [...] any prolonged detention is
carefully evaluated and justified.
Although the NSSR doesnt clarify
whether American citizens would be subjected to this policy as we saw with
the NDAA,
another section on page 10 dealing with the NSSRs merging of homeland
security and national security departments, points to this possibility as it
states,
We are now moving beyond traditional distinctions between homeland
and national security. This includes a determination to prevent terrorist
attacks against the American people by fully coordinating the actions that
we take abroad with the actions and precautions that we take at home.
A few
other possible examples of this policy in action could be; the effort to
implement re-education
camps domestically, the use of drones
over the U.S., and more broadly the designation of the world
as a battlefield by the 2012 NDAA.
Although it is difficult to fully
interpret much of the reports murky content into actual policies observed
in action, the main thrust of the strategy clearly articulates the creation
of a system of global governance with increased authority being given to the
international institutions.
There is no adequate effort being made to
address the vast corruption of these international institutions, as the administration
proposes to give them a more powerful and influential role in world
affairs.
The NSSR casually dismisses worries of their shortfalls,
shortcomings and
imperfections and conflates those concerns with a desire to reject them as
a whole, presenting a false dichotomy of
"isolationism vs. engagement of the institutions" (which equates to
giving them more authority). In addition to the corrupt and destructive
behavior of the international institutions that make up the new
international order, there are other signs indicating the type rule it would
impose.
The very undemocratic nature of word governments stealth
construction is a major warning sign illustrating the lack of relevance the
average person will have in this system and the secrecy in which it will
operate.
Created without their input, consent, or awareness, the average
person can expect to have no voice in a global, scientific dictatorship
managed by technocrats. Another stark indicator of future life under this
world government is the behavior of these institutions when they visit
cities across the world to hold conferences.
Scenarios resembling martial law crackdowns unfold as police dressed in
full riot gear are unleashed on the citizens, whose
peaceful protests are deemed unlawful."
Advisors, Thinktanks, and
Globalist Operatives
The Elites Hidden Hands Of World Government
While the Obama Doctrine brazenly works to
establish new norms and set new precedents, its program for a new
international order is not actually new.
It is merely the latest variation
of the global elites agenda which has been in progress since at least as
far back as the crises surrounding WWI with their efforts in "building a new world order" through the
Wilson
administration.
After WWI, the League of Nations was being touted as a way
to provide collective security in response to various crises and was considered then
to be "the
key to a new world order."
The ruling elite were able to
influence Wilson through his "proto-national
security advisor" Edward House and an advisory group House helped create
called The Inquiry. House and the Inquirys attempt at building global
government through the League of Nations failed due to strong
American opposition, but their work continued as The Inquirys efforts
morphed into the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).
Functioning as the premier policy think tank of
elite corporatists and finance oligarchs, the CFR would continue to push for
a world government on their behalf.
In the same way that the Inquirys post
WWI planning pursued world government through the League of Nations, the CFRs War &
Peace Studies Project would provide a framework for the new world order
after WWII and contribute to the creation of the United Nations.
While there
is no doubt that many people promoting the UN had good intentions and high
hopes that it could bring world peace, imperialists represented by groups
including the CFR saw it as a vehicle for world domination.
Over time, the elite grew and expanded their
networks of- intelligence agencies, foundations, secret societies, private
corporations, and think tanks. The interconnected and overlapping groups
including,
...evolved into a shadow network which hid from
the public, their supreme influence over governments and corporations.
These
groups worked to develop policy, build consensus around those policies and
implement them, as they placed their members into high level positions
throughout government and corporate institutions. A slow, step by step
approach helped to them to avoid opposition.
In 1958, the United States Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations invited the Council On Foreign Relations, the
Brookings Institute and 10 other organizations to contribute research to a
massive study
of U.S. foreign policy.
When the CFRs report, named "Study
No. 7, Basic Aims of U.S. Foreign Policy," was released the following
year it advised that the United States build
a new international order" by taking measures that included maintaining
and gradually increasing
the authority of the U.N.
Using this gradual approach, the global elite
incrementally pieced together elements of a world empire structure while
remaining largely invisible to the general public. When major changes are
made to the system, like the creation of new international institutions,
they are usually introduced in the context of large catastrophes such as
world wars or economic depressions.
By taking advantage of existing crises
or wholly manufacturing new ones, the ruling elite are able to manipulate
vulnerable populations into accepting policy changes they might otherwise
reject.
Major crises are valued by elite world planners and social engineers
as prime opportunities for the molding of world order and shaping of social
structures.
This view has been expressed repeatedly by
establishment operatives such as
Henry Kissinger who has had a long career
advocating and forecasting a new world order. As the global elites
archbishop of international policy, Kissinger is well versed in their
philosophical staples of opportunity from crises and order out of
chaos.
In
2008 he evoked these concepts (below video) during a conversation about the new world
order with Charlie Rose, stressing that,
there are so many problems in the
world at this moment that can only be dealt with on a global basis, and
that issues like proliferation, environment, energy, and global health
necessitate a global approach.
Comparing it to the situation after the
crises and chaos of WWII, when there was a creative period from which the
United Nations and NATO emerged, he noted that when the new administration
assesses the huge crisis it will find itself in, it might be able to use
the crises to construct an international system.
Kissinger had been making this specific
prediction as far back as 2005, when he stated that the beginning of
a new international order would emerge in the next four years.
He
reaffirmed the prediction in 2007 (below video) saying that,
there is a need for a new
world order and that at the end of this administration with all its
turmoil, and at the beginning of the next, we might actually witness the
creation of a new order
So when
Barack Obama emerged as the successor to
the disgraced Bush administration, Kissinger immediately recognized the
opportunity that the new presidents mass appeal provided the administration
he eagerly anticipated to usher in the new international order.
While
lauding the political usefulness of Obamas extraordinary reception around
the world in a
2009 interview (below video) with CNBCs Mark Hainse and Erin Burnett he stated that,
The president-elect is coming into office at a moment when there is
upheaval in many parts of the world simultaneously
and that his task will
be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period when, really, a
new world order can be created. Its a great opportunity, it isnt just a
crisis.
Soon after,
he argued in a New York times op-ed titled The Chance for a New World
Order that the grave financial and international crises provided Obamas
administration,
a unique opportunity for creative diplomacy.
He
wrote that amid the simultaneous economic and political crises,
an
international order will emerge if a system of compatible priorities comes
into being and that the alternative to a new international order is
chaos.
Kissingers legendary influence transcends
individual administrations and political parties.
David J. Rothkopf, a CFR
member and author of the book Running the World: The Inside Story of the
National Security Council and the Architects of American Power, wrote
in a 2005 article titled The Two Degrees of Henry Kissinger, that
within the small world of the U.S. national security community,
a number
of individuals have become especially influential
and that Nobody better
personifies this influence than Henry Kissinger, the dean of modern U.S.
foreign-policy professionals.
Mitt Romneys advisor Aaron Friedberg wrote
in 2011 that Kissinger,
may be the most influential figure in the making
of American foreign policy since the end of World War II
Kissinger is the
ultimate case study of an operative working on behalf of the elite,
influencing policy for generations, usually outside of public awareness.
He is the consummate insider, having been a member of such influential
societies and think tanks as the,
His
career is filled with numerous consulting roles for government agencies,
studies programs, and brain trusts like the Rand Corporation.
Puppet
presidents come and go, but establishment cronies like Kissinger remain
lurking in the shadowy background of the national security state.
Over the years Kissinger has remained close to
centers of power through several advisory roles, serving as National
Security Advisor and Secretary of State under President Richard Nixon and
then continuing his position as Secretary of State under Gerald Ford.
In
2006, author and journalist Bob Woodward revealed in his book, State of
Denial, that Kissinger had been advising
George Bush and Dick Cheney during the Iraq War.
He admitted to Woodward
that he had,
met with Cheney every month and the president every other month
since he took office.
Woodward
points out that,
a total of 36 hours over six years adds up to more time
with the president than almost any outsider ever.
In a twisted display of interweaving conflicts
of interest, Kissinger was initially appointed by Bush to head the
investigation into the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but was forced to withdraw
from the position after
family members of 9/11 victims requested (below video), he reveal his financial
dealings with the Bin-Laden family.
He was then replaced by CFR member
Philip Zelikow, who was less well known but whose conflicts of interests,
especially his role as the secret author of the 2002 NSSR Bush Doctrine,
were just as dubious.
Later, illustrating how tight and fast the circle of
revolving doors spin for connected insiders, both of these men returned to
play roles in the Obama administration as The Daily Telegraph reported
in 2009 that Kissinger had been sent to Russia on behalf of Barack Obama
to win backing for a nuclear disarmament initiative, and Zelikow
was appointed to Obamas Intelligence Advisory Board in 2011.
Kissingers behind the scenes relationship to Obama was further revealed by
Obamas National Security Advisor Gen. James Jones in 2009.
Speaking
before the Council on Foreign Relations, Jones, a former NATO Supreme
Commander in Europe, stated,
As the most recent National Security Advisor of
the United States, I take my daily orders from Dr. Kissinger, filtered down
through General Brent Scowcroft and Sandy Berger, who is also here. We have
a chain of command in the National Security Council that exists today.
Considering that Obamas administration is
filled with and surrounded by members of the global elites policy think
tanks like the
CFR, Bilderberg, Brookings and
Trilateral Commission and their political operatives like Henry
Kissinger, it should be no surprise that its NSSR narrative of global crises
requiring a new international order directly matches their writings.
While
many Americans hoped and believed they were going to see a great change with
a new president from an opposing party, establishment think tank members
from the Bush administration were simply replaced with different members of
the same establishment think tanks in the Obama administration.
In some
cases members actually continued their roles from one administration to the
next like former Director of Central Intelligence (under Bush Sr.) and CFR
member Robert Gates who
kept his job as Secretary of Defense when Obama took office.
Whether a Republican or Democrat is put into
office, the grand strategy behind the administration has been and will
continue to be controlled by the oligarchs. This method of control has been
developed over a long period of time to reach the extreme form it has taken
today. Agent Kissinger has been promoting exactly this kind of bipartisan
continuity of agenda for over 20 years.
In a 1988 article he coauthored for the CFR titled, Bipartisan
Objectives for American Foreign Policy, he stated,
we are convinced that
the American national purpose must at some point be fixed. If it is
redefined - or even subject to redefinition - with every change of
administration in Washington, the United States risks becoming a factor of
inconstancy in the world.
Noting that the,
nation is on the eve of a new
international era he expressed hope that the next president will
appreciate the value of continuity in American foreign policy.
In 2008 he revisited this concept in a speech at the Montreal Conference
of the Americas.
After promoting the destruction of the current system of
world order based on sovereign nation states as one of the creative acts of
the current period
he predicted a post election bipartisan effort in favor
of a world order model like that of the the European Union where European
countries freely are ceding their
much of their sovereignty.
In the
speechs closing Kissinger stated,
I will tell you that however our
election ends (
), a number of us in both parties have concluded that when
its over, we are going to make an effort to bring about a bipartisan
outcome, or direction of foreign policy.
Summary
The public is deceived by a false choice between
two sides, both dominated by the elite, who use the two party system as a
divide and conquer tactic, stalling the population by focusing their
attention inward while the rulers accomplish their wider agenda unimpeded.
While the masses are divided on wedge issues and distracted by the circus of
the right vs. left paradigm, the political establishment carries out the
bipartisan destruction of the economy, wages endless illegal and immoral
wars, and aggressively assaults civil liberties, as they transform America
into a surveilled police state resembling a hybrid fusion of popular science
fiction dystopias.
The controlled mainstream media has fed the
public a synthetic reality, laced with artificial narratives and modified
histories.
Mind controlled and brainwashed, their behavior programmed and
their thoughts prefabricated for them, the people have developed a deformed,
toxic consciousness due in large part to the continuous consumption of this
false reality.
Hypnotized and sedated, they sleepwalk in this impaired
state, through the complete destruction of their democratic republic, while
the ruling elite consolidate their grip on power by secretly shaping a
tyrannical, authoritarian, fascistic world government.
The Obama Doctrine, as embodied in the 2010 NSSR,
is a rejuvenated, bold effort to bring this long term new world order agenda
to fruition.
The scheme has reached an advanced stage in its evolution, as
it now unmasks itself in an unprecedented way, by emerging from the shadows
to take front stage in Americas primary strategy publication.
While the
Bush Doctrine advanced imperial aggression and power, the Obama Doctrine
seeks to advance and extend the scope and authority of the empire as a
whole. These progressions of empire will be passed on to and carried forward
by the next administration just as Obama carried forward the imperial
progressions passed to him.
The left hand is working with the right to
strangle the globe in a straitjacket of international institutions and
corporations under elite control.
We havent even seen three full years of
the 2010 NSSR in action, and whether under a new administration or not, the
next NSSR, not due until 2014, wont override the current grand strategy but
rather adjust and fine tune its guidance.
The terms new international order and new
world order are nothing more than public relations buzzwords and marketing
catchphrases that function as euphemisms working to portray the agenda as a
modern arrangement that has something to offer the rest of the world. In
reality it is a return to imperialist systems of the past, representing a
return to serfdom and slavery for the masses.
The modern world order
system of independent sovereign nation states we have had since the Treaty
of Westphalia is being abolished and replaced by a neo feudal corporate
world empire run by Anglo-American finance oligarchs and elite
global corporatists.
The Obama Doctrine is not about cooperation with
international institutions nor is it merely about humanitarian intervention;
it is about a world government. There is no more time for denial.
American
citizens and the common people of the world will have to come together like
never before to address this global threat.
They will have to get past the
divisions of race, religion and superficial party affiliations to unite in
an effort to confront this threat and take the reigns of global control from
the elite and their corporations, institutions and think tanks. A grassroots
globalism is needed to fight their engineered corporate globalism. This is
not about a class war with battle lines drawn between the upper, middle or
lower classes.
It is between the dominant minority superclass vs. the
masses.
World wide freedom is at stake and there has never been a more
important time than now to resist the global elites tyranny by raising
awareness and exposing their new world order agenda.
