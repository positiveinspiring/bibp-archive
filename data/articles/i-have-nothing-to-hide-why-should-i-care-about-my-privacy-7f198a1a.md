This is why... There are two sets of reasons to care about your privacy even if you've got nothing to hide:
ideological reasons practical reasons.

Ideological reasons
Your privacy is a right you haven't always had Just like the right to interracial marriage, the right to divorce, female labor, the freedom of speech, and so many others, we didn't always have the right to privacy. In several dictatorships around the world, they still don't. Generations before ours fought for our right to privacy. Not caring about it shows little knowledge about history and the importance of it. Privacy is a human right Article 12 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states: "No one must be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation." It's a human right just like the right to equality, to justice, freedom, a nationality, the right to religion, etc. Having nothing to hide is not true nor realistic Don't confuse privacy with secrecy. I know what you do in the bathroom, but you still close the door. That's because you want privacy, not secrecy. You have a passcode or some sort of security in your phone. Same goes for email. Nobody ever handed me their phone to allow me to read their chats or see their pictures. If you didn't have anything to hide, you wouldn't care. But you do. Everybody does. Privacy is something that makes you human.

Practical reasons
Information in the wrong hands becomes dangerous You might be okay with governments or security agencies or companies having your private information. You might trust Google and Facebook. But what if these get hacked and your information falls in the wrong hands? (See Yahoo or Ashley Madison.) Let's say, someone targeting your family, your company, your wife/husband. Would you still be okay with that? Would you be okay knowing that your photos, emails, or chats are in the hands of someone who can blackmail you? You can't predict the future Right now you may not have a lot to risk. But what about 30 or 40 years from now? Let's say you are running for a political position or administration of a public company. If Sony's hacking has told us anything is that your private information has impact in your life. Amy Pascal, co-chairman of the company, lost her job because of it. It's not just your job or potential job, it's also the integrity of your company. Can you imagine what it's like to have your company torn apart because of a conversation you had 5 or 10 years ago? What would it be like to lose your job because of a conversation you had by phone with your wife? Your private life out of context becomes a weapon We've all joked with things we consider sensitive. But, among friends, it's something we all do. In fact, our behavior changes depending on the people we're with. I bet I could find something offensive you said in a group chat that you have with your closest friends. Because they're your friends and it was a joke or a sarcastic remark. But take it out of context and it is not longer a joke. What would happen if this "joke" fell in the hands of someone trying to harm you? Your information has value A company like Facebook or Google allows you to upload unlimited data to their servers, for 'free.' What's their business model? How do they make so much money? They sell your info to advertising companies. But they never asked you if you wanted to sell your information. If someone asked you in person 100 questions about your personal life to sell it, would you answer them? Probably not, right? But you let this happen every time you use a service that makes money selling your info.

I hope I have at least made you think about your privacy and how much you might be exposing. Are you the kind of person who cares about this...?
