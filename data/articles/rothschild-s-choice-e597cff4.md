"The man Rothschild chooses - that man will
become President of the United States," Texe Marrs was told by an
insider.
So, who was Rothschild's Choice in 2008? The
answer is obvious: Barack Hussein Obama!
The fourth Baron de Rothschild, Lord
Jacob Rothschild of Great Britain, has
been called the 21st Century's "King of Israel." He and other Rothschilds
preside over the planet's greatest banking cartel, and Wall Street firms
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citibank, and others bow to Rothschild
dictates.
Politicians in world capitals, Washington, D.C., London, Paris,
and Tokyo grovel before their awesome power.
Rothschild's Choice documents the astonishing rise of a young, half blood
"Prince" of Jerusalem, a Communist adept named
Barack Obama who won
Rothschilds' favor - and was rewarded for his slavish devotion to their
sinister Agenda.
Here are the revelations that dissolve the mystery of Obama's meteoric,
virtually unheralded rise to global prominence and his elevation to the
highest seat of superpower government - the White House.
"Chosen by hidden superiors, we discover that President Barack Obama is heir
to a terrible Master Plan conceived long ago and now being lethally
implemented. Barack Obama has become the ultimate instrument in a dark plot
to deconstruct and 'murder' America."
