The abortive military-police coup in Ecuador,
which took place on September 30, has raised numerous questions about the
role of the US and its allies among the traditional oligarchy and the
leftist social movements, Indian organizations and their political parties.
While President Correa and all governments in Latin America, and significant
sectors of the Ecuadorian public described the violent actions as a coup,
the principle organ of Wall Street - The Wall Street Journal - described it
as a police protest.
Spoke persons for Goldman Sachs and the Council of
Foreign Relations referred to the police and military power grab against the
democratically elected government as a self-induced political crises of
the President.
While the coup was underway the Indian movement
CONAIE,
launched a manifesto condemning the government, while the
Indian party Pachakutik supported the ouster of the President and backed the police coup
as a just act of public servants.
In summary, the imperial backers of the coup , sectors of the Ecuadorian
elite and Indian movement downplayed the violent police uprising as a coup
in order to justify their support for it as just another legitimate
economic protest. In other words, the victim of the elite coup was
converted into the repressor of the peoples will.
The factual question of
whether their was a coup or not, is central to deciding whether the
government was justified in repressing the police uprising and whether in
fact the democratic system was endangered.
The Facts about the Coup
The police did not simply protest against economic polices, they seized
the National Assembly and attempted to occupy public buildings and media
outlets.
The air force - or at least those sectors collaborating with the
police - seized the airport in Quito, concerted actions seizing and blocked
strategic transport networks. President Correa was assaulted and seized and
kept hostage under police guard by scores of heavily armed police, who
violently resisted the Special Forces who eventually freed the president
resulting in scores of wounded and ten deaths.
Clearly the leaders of the
police uprising had more in mind that a simple protest over cancelled
bonuses - they sought to overthrow the president and were willing to use
their firepower to carry it off. The initial economic demands of public
sector employees were used by the coup leaders as a springboard to oust the
regime.
The fact that the coup failed is, in part, a result of the Presidents
vigorous and dramatic appeal to the people to take to the streets to defend
democracy - an appeal, which resonated with thousands of supporters and
denied the coup makers public support in the streets.
The facts on the ground all point to a violent attempt by the police and
sectors of the military to seize power and depose the president - by any
definition a coup. And so it was immediately understood by all Latin
American governments, from right to left, some of whom immediately closed
their frontiers and threatened to break relations if the coup leaders
succeeded.
The only exception was Washington - whose first response was not
to join in the condemnation but to wait and see what would be the outcome or
as presidential spokesperson Philip Crowley announced we are monitoring
events, referring to the uprising as a protest challenging the
government.
When Washington realized that the coup was actively opposed by
the Ecuadorian public, all the Latin American governments, the bulk of the
armed forces and doomed to failure, Secretary of State Clinton called Correa
to announce US backing for his government, referring to the coup as merely
an interruption of the democratic order.
In the run-up to the restoration of democracy, the trade unions were by and
large passive observers, certainly no general strikes were discussed or even
active mobilizations.
The response of top military officials in the army
were by and large opposed to the coup, except perhaps in the air force which
seized the principle airport in Quito, before handing it over to anti-drug
units of the police force.
The anti narcotic police were in the forefront of
the coup and not surprisingly were under intense US training and
indoctrination for the past five years.
Explanation for the Varied Responses to the Coup
The responses to and interpretations of the coup varied according to
different sets of objective interests and subjective perceptions.
Latin
American regimes unanimously rejected the coup fearing a coup multiplier
effect in the region, in which other successful coups (after last years in
Honduras) would encourage the military and police to act in their countries.
The memories of the recent past in which the military dismantled all
representative institutions and jailed, tortured, killed and exiled
political leaders was a key factor in shaping Latin Americas resounding
rejection.
Secondly, the existing political order benefits the capitalist
class, in almost all of Latin America and provides the bases for political
stability and elite prosperity. No powerful mass movements threaten
capitalist socio-economic hegemony, which might require the economic elite
to back a coup.
Correa supporters were in the streets, though not in the numbers of his
previous calls to action ousting ex-President Lucio Gutierrez.
They were
mainly party loyalists. Others supported his anti-imperialist measures
(expelling the US military base from Manta) or were defending democratic
institutions even as they have become critical of his recent policies.
The US vacillation, shifting from an initial refusal to condemn to later
denouncing the failed coup, was based on longstanding ties to the military
but especially the police. Between 2006-2011 US military and police aid will
have totaled $94 million, of which $89 million was channeled to the war on
drugs.
From 2006-2008, Ecuadorian military and police trainees numbered
931, 526 of whom were incorporated in the counter-drugs programs.
It was
precisely the anti-drug sector of the police which played a major role in
seizing the airports in Quito during the abortive coup. The US certainly had
plenty of motives for the coup. Correa came to power by ousting pro-US
client Lucio Gutierrez and decimating the oligarchical parties who were
responsible for dollarizing the economy and embracing Washingtons free
market doctrine. Correa called into question the foreign debt, declining to
pay debts incurred under fraudulent circumstances.
Most of all Correa was an
ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a member of
ALBA and a strong
opponent of Colombia, Washingtons main ally in the region. Ecuadors policy
weakened Washingtons strategy of encircling Venezuela with hostile
regimes. Having already backed the successful coup against Honduras
President Zelaya, an ally of Chavez, Washington had everything to gain from
a military coup which ousted another member of ALBA.
Washington is pursuing
a triple strategy of,
-
diplomacy, offering to improve relations
-
subversion by building subversive capacity by financing the police and
military
-
financing via AID, NED, World Bank and NGOs sectors of the
Indian movement especially Pachacutik and dissident groups linked Lucio
Gutierrez
The leadership of the Indian movement varied in its response to the coup.
The most extreme position adopted by the near moribund electoral party Pachacutik (US aid recipient) actually endorsed the police coup and call on
the masses to form a united front, a call which fell on deaf ears.
The
bulk of the Indian movement (CONAIE) adopted a complex position of denying
that a coup was taking place, yet rejecting the police violence and setting
forth a series of demands and criticisms of Correas policies and methods of
governance. No effort was made to either oppose the coup or to support it.
In other words, in contrast to its militant anti dictatorial past, CONAIE
was virtually a marginal actor.
The passivity of CONAIE and most of the trade unions has its roots in
profound policy disagreements with the Correa regime.
Correas Self-Induced Vulnerability
- His Right Turn
During the emerging citizens-movement five years ago, Rafael Correa played
an important role in deposing the authoritarian, corrupt and pro-imperialist
regime of Lucio Gutierrez.
Once elected President, he put in practice some
of his major electoral promises: evicting the US from its military base in
Manta; rejecting foreign debt payments based on illicit accounts; raising
salaries, the minimum wage, providing low interest loans and credit to small
business. He also promised to consult with and take account of the urban
social and Indian movements, in the lead up to the election of a
constitutional assembly to write up a new constitution. In 2007 Correas
list running with his new party
Alianza Pais (the country alliance) won a
two thirds majority in the legislature.
However facing declining revenues
due to the world recession, Correa made a sharp turn to right. He signed
lucrative contracts with multi-national mining companies granting them
exploitation rights on lands claimed by indigenous communities without
consulting the latter, despite a past history of catastrophic contamination
of Indian lands, water and habitat.
When local communities acted to block
the agreements, Correa sent in the army and harshly repressed the
protestors. In subsequent efforts to negotiate, Correa only heard his own
voice and dismissed the Indian leaders as a bunch of bandits, and
backward elements who were blocking the modernization of the country.
Subsequently, Correa went on the offensive against the public employees,
pushing legislation reducing salaries, bonuses and promotions, repudiating
settlements based on agreements between unions and legislators.
In the same
way Correa imposed new laws on university governance, which alienated the
professoriate, administration and students. Equally damaging to Correas
popularity among the organized sectors of the wage and middle classes, was
his authoritarian style in pushing his agenda, the pejorative language he
used to label his interlocutors and his insistence that negotiations were
only a means to discredit his counterparts.
Contrary to Correas claim to be a pathfinder for 21st century socialism,
he was, instead, the organizer of a highly personal strategy for 21st
century capitalism, one based on a dollarized economy, large scale foreign
investments in mining, petroleum and financial services and social
austerity.
Correas right turn, however; also depended on political and financial
support from Venezuela and its Cuban and Bolivian allies.
As a result Correa
fell between two chairs:
he lost support from the social left because of
pro-extractive foreign economic policies and austere domestic programs and
did not secure support from the US, because of his ties to Chavez and Cuba.
As a result, Correa so alienated the unions and the Indian and social
movements that he was only able to secure very limited amount of street
power in closing down the economy to thwart the coup.
Equally important,
the US and its collaborators saw in his declining organized support and the
growth of social protest, an opportunity to test the waters for a possible
coup, via their most dependable collaborators in the police and to a lesser
degree in the air force.
The police uprising was a test run, encouraged to
proceed, without any overt, commitment, pending its success or failure. If
the police coup secured sufficient military support, Washington and its
civilian political oligarchs could intervene, call for a negotiated
outcome which would either oust Correa or turn him into a pragmatic
client.
In other words, a successful coup would eliminate another Chavez
ally, but even a failed coup would put Correa on notice for the future.
Final Reflections in the Way of a Conclusion
The unfolding of the police coup turned into a farce: the coup makers
miscalculated their support within the military as well as among the
protesting Indians and unions.
They stood alone without glory or success.
Lacking national leaders, or even a coherent strategy, they were put down in
a matter of hours. They misjudged the willingness of the US to commit, once
it became clear that the coup makers lacked any resonance among the military
elite and were totally inept. What may have started as a coup ended as a
comic opera with a brief shoot-out with the military at a police hospital.
On the other side, the fact that Correa, in the end could only rely on his
elite special forces, to free him from police hostage, reveals the tragedy
of a popular leader.
One who started with immense popular backing, promising
to finally fulfill the demand of the campesinos for land reform, the Indians
demand for sovereignty to negotiate over mineral riches and urban labors
demands for just remuneration, and ended returning to the Presidential
Palace protected by military armored carriers.
The failed coup in Ecuador raises a larger political question:
Does the near
demise of Correa spell the end of the experiment of the new center-left
regimes which attempt to balance vigorous export-based growth with
moderate social payoffs?
The entire success of the center-left regimes has
been based on their ability to subsidize and promote agro-mineral foreign
and domestic capital while increasing employment, wages and subsistence
payments (anti-poverty programs).
This political formula has been
underwritten by the boom in demand from Asia and other world markets and by
historically high commodity prices.
When the
crises of 2008 broke, Ecuador
was the weakest link in Latin America, as it was tied to the dollar and was
unable to stimulate growth or cushion the economy. Under conditions of
crises, Correa resorted to repression of the social movements and trade
unions and greater efforts to secure support from petro-mining
multi-nationals.
Moreover, Ecuadors police and military was much more
vulnerable to infiltration by US agencies because of large scale funding and
training programs unlike Bolivia and Venezuela which had expelled these
agencies of subversion. Unlike Argentina and Brazil, Correa lacked a
capacity to conciliate diverse sectors of social movements through
negotiations and concessions.
Of course, the penetration of the Indian
communities by imperial funded NGOs promoting separatism and identity
politics did not make conciliation easy.
Nevertheless, despite the particularities of Ecuador, the failed coup
underlines the relative importance of resolving basic socio-economic
grievances, if the center-left macro-economic projects are to succeed. Apart
from Venezuela, none of the center-left regimes are carrying out structural
reforms (land reform) nationalizations of strategic sectors, income
redistribution.
Even the Chavez regime in Venezuela has lost a great deal of
popular support because of neglect of essential services (public safety,
garbage collection, delivery of water, electrical power and food delivery)
because of corruption and incompetence. Over time, the center-left can no
longer depend on charismatic leaders to compensate for the lack of
structural changes.
The regimes must sustain the improvement of wages and
salaries and delivery of basic services in an ambience of social dialogue.
The absence of continuous social reforms, while agro-mining elites prosper,
opens the door for the return of the right and provokes divisions in the
social coalitions supporting the center-left regimes. Most important the
implosion of the center-left provides an opportunity for Washington to
subvert and overthrow the regimes, reverse their relatively independent
foreign policy and reassert its hegemony.
The institutional foundations of the center-left are fragile everywhere,
especially the police and army, because officialdom is still engaged in
government programs with US military, narco-police and intelligence
agencies.
The center-left regimes - except Venezuela - have continued to
participate in all joint military programs. The center-left has not
transformed the state. Equally important it has promoted the economic bases
of the pro-US Right via its agro-mineral export strategy.
It has ignored the
fact that political stability is temporary and based on a balance of social
power resulting from the popular rebellions of the 2000-2005 period.
The
center-left ignores the reality that as the capitalist class prospers, as a
result of center-left agro-mineral export strategies, so does the political
right. And as the wealth and political power of the export elites increase
and as the center-left turns to the Right, as has been the case with Correa,
there will be greater social conflict and a new cycle of political
upheavals, if not by the ballot box then via the bullet - via coups or via
popular uprisings.
The successful
coup in Honduras (2009) and the recent failed coup in Ecuador
are symptomatic of the deepening crises of post-neo-liberal politics.
The
absence of a socialist alternative, the fragmentation of the social
movements, the embrace of identity politics, have severely weakened an
effective organized alternative when and if the center-left regimes go into
crises.
For the moment most critical intellectuals cling to the
center-left in hopes of a left turn, of a political rectification, rather
than taking the difficult but necessary road of rebuilding an independent
class based socialist movement.
