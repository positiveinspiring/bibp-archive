Operation Paperclip (also credited as Project Paperclip) was the code name under which the U.S. intelligence and military services extracted German scientists from Nazi Germany, during and after the final stages of World War II.
In 1945 the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency was established and given direct responsibility for Operation Paperclip.[1]
Osenberg List
Following the German failure of its invasion of the Soviet Union (codenamed Operation Barbarossa) and the entry of the US into WWII, the strategic position of Germany was at a disadvantage since German military industries were unprepared for a long war.
As a result, Germany began efforts in spring 1943 to recall scientists and technical personnel from combat units where their skills could be used in research and development:[2]
Overnight, Ph.D.s were liberated from KP duty, masters of science were recalled from orderly service, mathematicians were hauled out of bakeries, and precision mechanics ceased to be truck drivers. Dieter K. Huzel
The recall effort first required identifying such personnel and then tracking them (particularly for loyalty), which culminated in the Osenberg List by Werner Osenberg, a University of Hannover engineering scientist who headed the Wehrforschungsgemeinschaft (English: Military Research Association).[3]
In March 1945, a Polish laboratory technician found the shredded pieces of the Osenberg List in a toilet that hadn't flushed properly.[4]
US Army Major Robert B Staver, Chief of the Jet Propulsion Section of the Research and Intelligence Branch of the US Army Ordnance in London, subsequently used the Osenberg list to compile the Black List, the code name for the list of scientists targeted for interrogation, with the rocket scientist Wernher von Braun's name at the top.[5]

Operation Overcast
The original unnamed plan to interview only the rocket scientists changed after Major Staver sent a cable (signed by Colonel Joel Holmes) to the Pentagon on May 22, 1945 of the urgency to evacuate the German technicians and their families as "important for Pacific war."[4]
Likewise, an equally strong desire was to deny German expertise to the Soviet Union.
In the Operation Alsos case of Werner Heisenberg, the head of the German nuclear energy project:
" he was worth more to us than ten divisions of Germans."[6]
In addition to scientists specializing in rocketry and Nuclear physics, various Allied teams were also searching for experts in chemistry, medicine, and naval weapons.
An effort that predated Overcast was the US Navy's acquisition in May 1945 of Dr. Herbert A. Wagner, who [7] worked at Naval Air Station Point Mugu in 1947. The majority of the scientists were involved with the V-2 rocket, and the rocket group was initially housed with their families at a housing project in Landshut Bavaria. Operation Overcast was designated by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff on July 19, 1945,[5] but when the nickname "Camp Overcast" was being openly used for the housing, the code name was changed to Paperclip.[5][4] By 1958, many aspects of Paperclip had become common knowledge. It was openly mentioned in a Time magazine article about von Braun.[8]
Groups of scientists
In early August 1945, Colonel Holger N. Toftoy, chief of the Rocket Branch in the Research and Development Division of Army Ordnance, offered initial one-year contracts to the rocket scientists. After Toftoy agreed to take care of their families, 127 scientists accepted the offer.
In September 1945, the first group of seven rocket scientists arrived from Germany at Fort Strong in the US:
Wernher von Braun Erich W. Neubert Theodor A. Poppel August Schultze Eberhard F. M. Rees Wilhelm Jungert Walter Schwidetzky [4]
Wernher von Braun
Erich W. Neubert
Theodor A. Poppel
August Schultze
Eberhard F. M. Rees
Wilhelm Jungert
Walter Schwidetzky [4]
Eventually the rocket scientists arrived at Fort Bliss, Texas for rocket testing at White Sands Proving Grounds as "War Department Special Employees."[2] In early 1950, legal status for some "Paperclip Specialists" was obtained when visas were issued[5] at the US consulate in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico; from which the scientists legally entered the US.[2] In later decades, some scientists' WWII wartime activities were investigated Arthur Rudolph was linked to the Mittelbau-Dora slave labor, and Hubertus Strughold was implicated in Nazi human experimentation. Eighty-six aeronautical experts were transferred to Wright Field, which had also acquired aircraft and other equipment under Operation Lusty.[9] The United States Army Signal Corps employed 24 specialists including:
physicists: Dr. Georg Goubau Dr. Gunter Guttwein Dr. Georg Hass Dr. Horst Kedesdy Dr. Kurt Levovec physical chemists: Professor Rudolf Brill Dr. Ernst Baars Dr. Eberhard Both geophysicist Dr. Helmut Weickmann technical optician Dr. Gerhard Schwesinger electronics engineers: Dr. Eduard Gerber Dr. Richard Guenther Dr. Hans Ziegler [1]

The United States Bureau of Mines employed seven German synthetic fuel scientists in a Fischer-Tropsch chemical plant in Louisiana, Missouri in 1946.[2] In 1959, 94 Paperclip individuals went to the US, including:
Friedwardt Winterberg Hans Dolezalek Friedrich Wigand [7]
Friedwardt Winterberg
Hans Dolezalek
Friedrich Wigand [7]
Through 1990, Paperclip acquired a total of 1,600 personnel,[7] with the "intellectual reparations" taken by the U.S. and the UK (mainly German patents and industrial processes) valued at close to $10 billion.[10]
