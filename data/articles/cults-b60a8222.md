ELIZABETH CLARE PROPHET - THE ULTIMATE BLUFF
The following has been written in hindsight of my experiences within
Elizabeth Clare Prophet's Spiritual New Age organization originally founded
as the
Summit Lighthouse then later christened the
Church Universal and
Triumphant.
It should be noted that what is written is not intended in any
way to be in support of or empathy with the Teachings and beliefs of the
Organization and its followers.
I am in full support of the right that each
of us has to choose that which we believe and the right to act according to
our beliefs. However I believe that if we are seeking the truth, with
sincerity and good intentions, that the organizations we are involved with
should not separate us and our common search for the truth.
I know that those within this organization from which I escaped may not find
this pleasant reading within their current mind-set, they may be called to
give worldwide decree, prayer and mantra vigils against myself or others who
speak out against such deceit and injustice. These decree, prayer and mantra
vigils, I know to be a very real, vicious and destructive energy, when
directed at one personally is no less than a form of intense black magic,
hell-bent on the destruction of the ones it is targeted at.
My hope is that
those truly sincere people who are still involved and committed to this
organization will start to think for themselves and question all that is
taught them. That they will not blindly swallow each and everything that is
fed them. That they will remember the promise of Jesus that the Kingdom of
God is within them. That they truly analyze and scrutinize the effects and
impact of the Teachings and their practices upon themselves and their lives.
I had always believed, that I had a reasonably strong will and
self-determination, yet I wasn't prepared for what lay ahead. I spent three
of the most intense years of my life deeply buried in a
New Age organization
known as The Summit Lighthouse, aka The Church Universal and Triumphant, led
by Elizabeth Clare Prophet and based in Montana, U.S.A.
I was exploited and conned out of many thousands of dollars, exploited
emotionally, mentally and physically, and gave incredible amounts of energy
and time to what I now realize was a lost cause.
I eventually escaped from my imminent self-destruction under the guise of
spiritual salvation. It was one of the most difficult and exhausting
experiences of my life. I believe I escaped due to my desire to push
everything to the limit to apply all that was taught to the extreme, to
sincerely and truly make it all work and of course I acknowledge the help
that was given me, known and unknown.
With a truly honest and determined approach I was eventually able to see
that all that I had striven to achieve within this organization and in my
life was coming to naught; worse still, everything was going backwards at a
rapidly increasing rate. All the promises, hopes and dreams that were given
me were eventually seen for the illusions and lies that they were.
However it brings me no peace to know that there are many others who may be
still trapped within these vulturous lairs, where they are nothing more than
a meal ticket of extraordinary proportions. They, like I was, are exploited
and milked in every conceivable way.
What's more, they applaud, cheer and
fawn over their Leader, Elizabeth Clare Prophet (ECP) and the so-called Ascended
Masters, the spiritual benefactors of this organization, all the while they
are being chewed up and spat out incessantly. I was from early on
overwhelmed by the seemingly large proportion of insincere people in this
organization who initially seemed welcoming and friendly.
But very soon all
this changes when you become a committed part of the organization. I
remember saying out loud on several occasions that I do not want to end up
like them after 10 years in this organization. I could never really
understand why those who have listened and followed the teachings for over a
decade did not seem to follow the fundamental spiritual principles which
they, above all others, are supposed to know so well.
There are, of course,
those who are genuinely committed to doing what they believe is the right
thing.
One of the main problems is that you are always made to focus on yourself
and your own shortcomings as the traditional and well-known religious adages
go, you have to "turn the other cheek" and also you are not to judge others,
lest ye be judged. However these very principles are what keep you bound and
trapped within such an organization. For you are forever excusing away the
inexcusable, forever overlooking that which should necessitate closer
scrutiny, and ultimately looking upon your own weaknesses and lack of
spirituality as the cause.
Elizabeth Clare Prophet speaks and commands with such authority that none
dare to question or doubt even the slightest thing that she says. She gives
weekly dictations which are similar but, according to her, not channeling
of the Ascended Masters, the Angels, The Elohim, the Archangels.
It is
proclaimed that she is the highest representative of God upon this planet
and the beings that talk through her confirm this to be so.
Elizabeth Clare Prophet condemns clairvoyance, psychic powers and the like
to be of the
lower astral realms and dangerous for anyone to engage in. All
the while it appears that she manifests these same phenomena which, of
course, are supposed to have no relationship to the psychic or clairvoyant,
that her followers are forever warned against engaging in.
Elizabeth Prophet has such command and control over her followers that it
has to be seen to be believed. Looking back, it is very easy to see the
incredible bluff by which people are held captive. Firstly all people are
kept in bondage and slavery through mainly subtle threats of damnation and
failure if any leave the teachings, although none of her brainwashed
followers see her as anything other than an un-ascended Master, holding the
highest office of God on this planet.
These are not over-embellished
statements, but exact ones of the true situation. If anything they are
understatements. A genuine, objective, honest researcher into this
organization will prove this to be so.
I spent three full years in this organization, read several thousands of
pages of the literature and listened to several hundred dictations and
videotape recordings. I witnessed personally the behavior and development
of the people associated with the organization throughout my time there.
The following points indicate the fear and threat tactics that ECP uses,
along with the so-called representatives of God that speak through her:
-
This path is the Highest Path to God
-
Those who leave the Teachings may not be
granted another opportunity to walk this path (by God) for possibly
100,000 years
-
Those who do not Ascend are not immortal
beings
-
You cannot ascend until you have
balanced almost 100% of your Karma. And if you are allowed to Ascend
before you have balanced 100% of your Karma then you must still
balance the remainder in the Ascended state
-
Those who do not use the Violet Flame of
Saint Germaine cannot ascend
-
You cannot Ascend without attending a
certain portion of the weekly services held by the organization
-
You can not Ascend without the daily use
of the decrees provided by this organization
-
Those who have left the teachings are considered to have taken the Left
Handed Path, by many of the followers of ECP. Theirs is, of course, or so
they claim, the right handed path to God, so it does not leave much to the
imagination to determine what the left handed path is
NOTE: The Ascension is the ultimate goal of the followers of ECP and The
Ascended Masters. It is said to be the process whereby once we have balanced
all our karma and fulfilled our service to God, we are reunited with that
immortal part of our being and again become one with God, from whom we were
separated in our fall from grace and rebellion against him, as is supposed
to have occurred in the Biblical documented fall of Lucifer.
It should be known that ECP herself has claimed to have
balanced her karma
twice over!
So from all of the above points it can be seen that any person who was
sufficiently brainwashed would suffer great anxiety and fear if ever
confronted with the possibility of leaving or having to leave the
organization. I know this to be true for I experienced it personally.
I would like to give an example of the most amazing control that Elizabeth
Clare Prophet has over her followers. In 1993 she gave a lecture entitled
"Nine Cats, Nine Lives", in which she herself proclaimed that she had been a
prostitute in a past life and that it was God's will for her to be a
prostitute to balance her karma!
(This is a great way to validate our lives. It means one can say that being
an evil exploitative prostitute, etc., in a life may be God's will used to
balance one's karma!)
I remember being approached by a long time follower (15 years +) who was so
joyful at hearing this explanation, that she was literally bubbling with joy
at the prospect of her exalted spiritual Guru being a prostitute. The only
way I could later rationalize this was that it helped her equate with her
own lowliness and insignificance that most people are conditioned to feel.
Of course there is always the odd pep talk and encouragement to make you
feel as if you are one of the chosen of God. This pep talk encourages you
when you are at your lowest to get up and give your all again, body, mind
and soul for the cause. But mostly all that comes through the books, tapes,
lectures, dictations (channellings) is just a constant form of subtle and
not-so-subtle put-down.
One dictation by the Ascended Master Morya even
suggested that everyone wear badges saying that "I want to be pummeled!".
This was a serious statement, not an intended pun, meaning that they wanted
to be chastised and punished by the so-called Masters and leaders of the
organization for their own good, benefit and discipline. Thank God, I left
just before I got my badge! After all, I couldn't take any more pummeling
than I already had.
The above mentioned audio tapes are still available through the
organization.
Elizabeth Prophet in one lecture that I was listening to was discussing a
past experience when a number of people left the organization. She was
explaining how this had caused her great sadness and that she didn't
understand why, until, of course, one of the Ascended Masters came to her
and explained that those who left did not have enough love within them.
In my opinion, such a ploy was a very powerful one which could play on the
emotions and fears of the followers if, and when, they were to ever
contemplate leaving.
Another one of the main teachings of this organization was that of the
"Threefold Flame" - a small flame that was said to be burning within our
hearts at a spiritual level. This flame consists of three plumes each one
representing Love, Wisdom and Power - pink, blue and yellow respectively.
Another one of our enormous tasks was to balance this flame within our
hearts, through the application of the teachings, decrees, services, karma
balancing, etc. It was taught that this flame could be extinguished through
one outburst of temper or anger! This meant that our Divine spark once
extinguished is like a loss of one's Divinity, literally like a spiritual
death of our being.
(If this was true, Jesus would have lost his when
he had an angry outburst
whipping the money-lenders who despoiled God's temple.)
Another very popular teaching of ECP and the Masters was that of what they
termed "Mechanized Man" - a robotic, totally godless creation that had no
divinity within it.
(This teaching had great appeal for me as I had
independently observed that there were many people in life who by their
behavior and attitude, fitted this description. This godless creation was
supposedly created by the fallen ones, those who rebelled against God, as
typified in the biblical fall of Lucifer and his angels.)
Due to the great burdens, responsibilities and stress that one feels within
this organization it is very easy to have outbursts of anger on occasions
and it is a common thing for many of ECP's followers to let out their
pent-up repression, anxiety and stress. Then they would suffer the fear,
anxiety and mental torment that they had extinguished their Divine spark
(Threefold Flame), which would make them no different than the "Mechanized
Man" or godless creation.
After leaving The Summit Lighthouse or
Church Universal & Triumphant, I
managed to obtain a copy of a book entitled "Lambs to Slaughter" by
John Pietrangelo who was in the organization for 14 years.
This book would never
be read or believed by the loyal supporters of ECP. It is an insider's
behind-the-scenes look at ECP, her ex-husband and founder of the
Organization, Mark Prophet, who is now, supposedly, an Ascended Master. ECP
is currently married to husband # 4.
An ex-husband of ECP's, Randall King,
features prominently. This book is almost incredible reading, by any
standards and yet it is truthful, for I can verify much of what is written
through my own experiences. Elizabeth Clare Prophet's ex husband Randall
King confesses that for years he would secretly meet at night with ECP while
she was still married to Mark Prophet to fulfill her sexual demands.
The rules in this organization are very strict. It would be closer to the
truth to say that this organization is run like a dictatorship, where you
must do everything that you are told or else suffer the consequences of your
karma.
One example I can give is where Lord Maitreya, states that his
Chelas
(disciples of a religious teacher) are not allowed to eat sugar in any form,
including, honey, rice malt, barley malt, raw sugar and refined sugars. It
was likely that you would not ascend if you ate sugar in any form also. I
could never find a valid reason or explanation for this though.
At the time,
I was already practicing a strict fanatical organic vegetarian diet that
excluded most refined products. However, I could not understand why we could
not use a little natural sweeteners. From my studies and experiences I
failed to see the harm that this would cause to our spiritual wellbeing.
Years later, after leaving the organization, I had a strong feeling that, in
some way, the total exclusion of sugars in our diet may allow for greater
brainwashing and control.
The Church Universal and Triumphant is said to be Lord Maitreya's
mystery
school.
In the organization run by ECP, the degree of how much sex married couples
are allowed to have on a weekly basis is prescribed. The total was to be no
more than half an hour per week. I know this to be true as I was elected to
the Board of Directors for the regional branch of the Organization that I
attended and was made to sign papers that vowed to the above requests.
A further point to the above, the week after I escaped from the
organization, I had in my possession two videos of ECP, one when she was on
the Oprah Winfrey show, in which she categorically and vehemently (and
mendaciously) denied that the married members of the organization were only
allowed to have 30 minutes of sex per week.
This was, and is, utter
hypocrisy, I had personally signed the papers as part of my election to the
board of directors that stated exactly this time specification!
These same
papers stated that only married couples were allowed to have sexual
relations.
GIVE AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE!
Prophet is always in one way or another trying to milk her followers of
money.
There is always the requests for regular tithing to the organization
and fund raising events. The promise of receiving tenfold what you give is
perceived as a 10 to 1 bet that cannot lose. However, in reality, most of
the followers are on the poverty line. I have not seen anyone receive
anything in return for their constant giving and sacrifice.
The problem is
that everything can be rationalized. For example, you are said to have
received many blessings of the light of God in your life, the privilege of
walking this Path, the gift of more and more opportunities to be of service
to God, the books, teachings, protection of the Angels, balancing of your
karma, etc... etc... ad nauseam.
One well-known statement of the
Ascended Masters and ECP was that our reward
was the opportunity for more service and giving to the Ascended Masters and
the organization, and there was unlimited opportunities for that!
Here is another example of one of the most cunning and deceitful
manipulations of her followers to gain money: ECP announced that the
Ascended Master, El Morya, was calling for each of his Chela's to send in
$1000 to the organization. After all, who would dare refuse such a request
from an exalted being of God? I certainly didn't, and I was twice a fool
because I sent the equivalent of US dollars which totaled at that time
$1,500 Australian, for I felt that it would not be $1000 if it arrived as
say $US 650.
With the request was the much promoted promise that we would
receive tenfold in return that which we gave to God. Well here is what
happened to me: At the time, I had a total of $3000 dollars in the bank
which I had just managed to put together in the last three months. Prior to
this I had been in debt for three years paying off loans for various things
and for specialized education.
I finally had saved a little collateral, a
little slice of financial freedom. Well, I enthusiastically made the
decision to send off the $US 1,000 ($AU 1,500) and believed that my Masters
would be well pleased, and that I would be looked after in the future if I
needed help. Later that same week the engine in my car blew up and I was
forced to cough up not only the remaining $1500 dollars in my bank but quite
a bit more.
As if that wasn't enough, my little old car was never the same
again. The mechanics did an appalling job. I was soon forced to take out
another loan for yet another car which bound me to debt for another 3 years.
I was so pre-occupied with trying to serve and please those whom I believed
to be my benevolent Spiritual Masters and benefactors, that I forgot to
check the oil in my car. I was attending 3-4 services a week at a distance
of one hour's drive, holding personal decree, prayer and mantra vigils for
2-4 hours daily, and on weekends for 4-10 hours.
At this time I was also
tithing 10% of my net wages to the local branch in Melbourne "The Summit
Lighthouse Study Group of Melbourne", and giving regularly at each of the
services, as well as to the regular fund-raising programs. I estimate that
the net loss to me for my involvement with the organization would be
$20,000, at least.
That is not to mention all the additional work I gave up
to attend services and fulfill my spiritual obligations, the traveling costs
over 3 years, and most importantly, all the time and energy I gave with such
goodwill and intentions. Fortunately, I had left several months before
making the trip to Montana I had planned.
Other people wasted over 10-15 years of their time in the organization,
spent up to, or over, $100,000 dollars, in their devotion and commitment to
the Organization.
This included several trips to the organization's
headquarters in Montana, U.S.A., the purchase of bomb shelters, the purchase
of emergency food supplies - in the event of world cataclysm which ECP and
the Ascended Masters were so fond of predicting - tithing, constant giving
to all the fund-raising events, "Love Offerings" (as they were called at
each of the regional services where, at the end, a bowl was passed around
for contributions) attending the Summit University Courses in Montana and so
on.
The Summit University courses are exalted to such a degree that a member of
the Organization is made to feel as if she/he must attend, otherwise they
will not Ascend. Many gave up their jobs to attend these courses as they run
for 2-3 months each and there are several levels known as SU 1 & SU 2, etc.
A member of the local organization who held such lightly concealed enmity,
jealousy and hatred towards me, lorded it over me on occasions, citing how
he had attended two levels and that he had etheric stripes on his spiritual
bodies to show for it.
He stated that I should do everything possible to
attend Summit University and that I should pray very hard that I may be able
to do it. It was reported to me by a friend, and long-time member of the
organization, that at one time ECP requested that everyone should sell their
house and give 10% of it to her.
One particular little old lady who was
quite sincere but naive and innocent had to be reassured that she should not
do this.
I believe it was in 1987 when ECP announced that earth changes and major
cataclysms were about to occur. At this time many members of the
organization sold, homes, businesses, quit jobs, moved families, nationally
and internationally. Then when nothing happened ECP, of course, was adept at
saying in lectures that she never said such and such, etc., etc.
One member
of the Organization whom I knew, related to me how ECP had personally called
for them to go from Australia to Montana because of these predictions.
John Pietrangelo,
in his book of exposés of Elizabeth Clare Prophet jokingly
but accurately called her Elizabeth Clear Profit!
When one understands that
she owns literally everything including the 33,000 acres of land that is The
Church Universal and Triumphant, and the minds of all her followers, and yet
claims to just take for herself a modest wage, each week, which is quite a
ridiculous concept to the objective observer who would see Prophet forever
parading in the most expensive, new designer clothes on many frequent
occasions.
The staff of the organization are no more than underpaid (if paid
at all), overworked servants and slaves.
I have first hand information and experience from those who lived and worked
at the Montana headquarters, who worked fulltime (rather all the time), for
tiny quarters and meals and a small allowance per month of sometimes no more
the $US 64. Non-permanent staff had to pay for the privilege of working for
the Organization. The staff worked extremely long hours and then in their
spare time they had to attend all the services, lectures, dictations.
They
were expected to be up at 5 a.m. to commence daily decree and prayer vigils,
lunchtime decree sessions and evening decree sessions. On top of this, you
were expected to read all the literature produced by the organization, study
the lectures, listen repeatedly to the taped dictations that were given
through ECP. One was expected to read material, not once, but 3 times.
The
harder you worked, the more energy, money, time and effort you contributed,
the more you were led to believe you were truly on the way, when, in truth,
everyone was going nowhere, but was being conned and milked of every last
ounce of energy, sanity, money and time. I was elected to the Board of
Directors of the Melbourne Group and I know first hand what one is expected
to do.
Prophet raised, in one fund-raising event only, over 1 million dollars,
which was for the "Save Our Church" fund.
This fund-raising was for the
defense of the Church's tax exempt status which was reported by ECP and the
organization to be under threat from the IRS. I was a member of this Church
at the time and well remember the countless requests for donations or "Love
Offerings" as they called them, as well as the large number of prayer and
decree vigils we dedicated to this cause.
The Church announced that it had retained its tax exempt status and members
were congratulated for their efforts. But how the money raised by this fund
was really used is anyone's guess. Any money left over was certainly not
sent back. There is no doubt about that.
The "Pearls Of Wisdom" are the transcribed weekly dictations of (supposedly)
exalted beings as Archangel Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Jesus, Mother Mary,
Buddha, Zoroaster, Hercules, The Elohim, Saint Germaine, El Morya, Kuthumi,
etc., etc. One quote that sticks in my mind vividly is that one of these
exalted beings admonished us to "give that we may receive browny points in
heaven"!
Of course I had left when I read this and could see the clear
ridiculousness of such a statement.
NOTE: C.U.T (Church Universal and Triumphant) was taken right out of the Book
of Revelations and purported to be a necessary undertaking that Prophet took
to ensure tax evasion. After all, The Summit Lighthouse, the founding name
of the organization, did not sound legitimate enough to achieve tax
exemption.
NOTE: Chela is literally interpreted there to mean "slave"! The Book entitled
"The Chela and the Path" by the Ascended Master, El Morya, in no uncertain
terms makes this clear. What level of control and manipulation does it take
to literally call the followers and disciples of the Ascended Masters slaves
and for those followers to applaud, cheer, fawn and throw their life
literally at the feet of these beings?
STRANGE & CONTRADICTING EXPERIENCES
I had many experiences that were very contradictory to the whole teachings
and promises of the organization. Most would not even believe them to be
true. Countless nights I awoke from my sleep with the very real physical
feeling of being suffocated and strangled in my sleep.
At other times I
actually had
clear perceptions of some monstrous type of entities sucking the life force
out of me. All this occurred after saying hours of prayers for protection
and appeal to the so-called higher powers of the Ascended Masters.
I could
not understand how the millions and billions of Angels that were claimed to
be protecting the loyal followers could not protect one person from attacks
by forces of evil intent that manifested themselves more and more in my life
as I was striving to achieve a level of spirituality and truth.
WHO, WHAT & WHERE IS EVIL?
One of the trickier aspects of this organization is that a great part of the
Teachings were focused on the great Evil being perpetrated in the world.
Elizabeth and her spiritual overseers were so busy pointing and directing
our attention to the Evils of this world, that it is almost impossible to
look back upon their source as being of evil intent itself. Our attention
was constantly directed 7 days per week to giving hours of long prayer &
decree vigils, to calling for the judgment of evil, by the powers of God.
On top of this we had to seek our own salvation through the many supposedly
necessary practices which had to be enacted on a daily basis. I ended up
spending 40 hours at work and close to that tending to what I believed were
all my spiritual obligations, which, at the time, I willingly and
enthusiastically carried out.
JUST ANOTHER RELIGION
Elizabeth Prophet teaches and lectures upon all of the world's Religions,
which becomes all the more confusing for the poor spiritual seekers who are
within her organization.
It is enough for one to try and understand and
assimilate the Christian Bible as it is today, let alone all the world's
major Religions. I know I could never really stomach much of the Bible,
except for a few passages of the New Testament. I was genuinely attracted to
this ECP organization initially because I was able to make the logical
conclusion based upon my observations that Religion was the source of many
wars, racism, hatred and violence that occur every day on this planet.
Yet I
had no idea how I would be embedded in these very things within the ECP
organization.
After I had escaped from this organization, I came to realize fully that
this was just another cleverly disguised organization that was not much
different to any of the world's Religions and used much of the same tactics
upon its followers.
Elizabeth Clare Prophet and all the supposedly
high spiritual beings and
agents of God which speak through her, use all of the fear tactics to keep
the followers bound and trapped by fear, such as:
-
the fear of damnation
-
the
fear of leaving the organization
-
the fear of not being reunited with
God
-
the fear of loss of Divinity
-
the fear of failing to balance one's karma and
having to reincarnate countless lifetimes
-
the fear of karmic retribution
for every thought, word, and deed outside the will of God, etc., etc.
Her followers were led to believe that this was the
True organization or
Church of God on this planet and that eventually all those who are to be
reunited with, or Ascend to, God must eventually find this path to do so.
She does mention a few exceptions to this, but they are rare.
BRAINWASHING AND CONTROL EN MASSE
I never believed it possible for myself to be so brainwashed, so controlled
and so much at the mercy of one such as Elizabeth Clare Prophet.
Everyone in
the organization is so controlled and brainwashed, it has to be seen to be
believed, yet not one would admit it. I must have had some semblance of
independent thinking left within me, for I was never able to rationalize one
of the main thrusts of the Teachings, that of the Law of Karma. As I looked
around me, within my family, and in the world, all those not-so-nice people
seemed to be having the best time of it.
Later I was able to realize that,
if Karma was true and fair, all the Good people would be running this
planet.
Most, if not all, of the followers whom I personally interacted with, did
not think with their own minds, they did not question anything, but accepted
everything that was given them at face value. When they spoke, often it was
"The Mother said this", or "The Masters said that", or "By the Grace of
God", etc. This now is a sure sign to me that indicates such people are
candidates for easy brainwashing and control.
NOTE: It should be known that ECP is known as and called by her followers as
Mother. As in the "Divine Mother", not the earthly-type mother.
This is really scary stuff when I think about it now. This would indicate
total submission and laying of one's self at the feet of ECP and to the
Masters, to that which they will, and believe me they will and want an
extraordinary amount!!!
Suffering in this organization was seen as an essential part of
balancing
our karma and achieving a better Resurrection, as Jesus suffered and died
upon the cross, and was resurrected. The Ascended Master El Morya stated
that "Suffering is the spice of life!".
This was a hard concept for me to
understand.
We were all taught to believe that suffering was/is, not only
good for us, but that we should welcome our returning bad Karma as an
opportunity to repay our debts and progress towards a higher level of
spirituality and eventual liberation.
RATIONALIZATION
Everything was always rationalized to our own disadvantage by ECP and the
Ascended Masters, and the self-proclaimed exalted beings, Angels,
Archangels, Elohim, etc., etc., who dictated through Prophet.
For example,
if one was to suffer an injury or accident, even after giving hours of
prayers, decrees, and mantras for the purpose of protection, purity,
karma-balancing and judgment of evil, it was still taught that it was our
karma and that it was not only God's will, but that it was necessary to
experience the return of what we originally sent out, and ultimately we were
just receiving the return of the evil that we ourselves were said to be
responsible for.
A member of the organization who died in an automobile accident was said by
ECP and the Masters to have been speeding and that we cannot be protected by
the prayers, decrees, mantras, and angels of God if we are simultaneously
breaking the laws of this world which we must obey at all times.
I myself
cut my finger on one occasion to the point of probably needing stitches,
(which I did not get), after a 4 hour prayer, decree & mantra vigil. I do
remember pondering this deeply as to how and why this could possibly happen
after what I had done.
Eventually I just rationalized it away as my karma,
the will of God, and the balancing of a portion of something wrong or evil I
committed in some time past which I had no possible way of ever knowing what
the heck it was.
TRUE GNOSTICISM
The Writings of Dr J.S. Chiappalone & Annwn Publications
I can now put all of the above experiences into perspective through my
understanding of Gnosticism. I was fortunate to find understanding of my
situation and experiences in life through a study of the books written by Dr
J.S. Chiappalone on Gnosticism, which have become my greatest source of
understanding of my experiences and of life as we know it. These writings
and teachings have also provided me with a liberation that I never dreamed
possible.
The first book I read, that was lent me, upon leaving the organization, was
a book entitled "Revelation of the truth".
This book totally validated and
confirmed not only my experiences in life but also my experiences in the ECP
organization. For example, one chapter in this book alone, Chapter 29 -
The Law of Reward and Punishment (Karma), which was only 5 pages in length, made
me understand my entire predicament with ECP and her organization.
If Karma
is a creation of Evil, which observation of this world would indicate is
correct, for there is little, if any, justice, then the foundation of this
entire ECP organization falls to pieces. I truly felt and was treated in
this organization as the bad guy, as the one who needed to be punished, who
needed to suffer, who needed to experience the return of my evil deeds
committed over many lifetimes that I could not even remember.
While I was within this ECP organization I always felt disappointed that we
were not allowed to remember our past lives, for I believed that it would be
more useful if I could remember all that I had learnt in past lives.
Dr Chiappalone's writings also state that Reincarnation is an evil-created
system that is designed for us to forget purposely. This was like a huge
bell ringing in my head! Of course, that explains it all. I somehow knew
this to be true without a doubt.
And so, many of my answers and questions
were found in these Gnostic writings.
ENERGY LOSS AND SUPPRESSION - REAL EXPERIENCES
Many of my experiences were not only defined but also confirmed by my study
of the books of Dr J.S. Chiappalone, and Annwn Publications.
One of the most
significant day to day experiences was my inability to function in the
presence of certain people. These certain people had the ability to drain me
of energy, to make me feel extremely suppressed, depleted of energy, totally
at a loss and dejected within my work environment. To make things worse, I
felt this way with many I worked with.
Dr Chiappalone explains that the
purpose of the entire evil-created system that we live in at present is set
up for the extraction of energy from those of the True Creation.
He describes energy suckers that certain beings have on the energy level
which attach to you and drain you of your energy. Well I could certainly
relate to this for this experience was common to me, even though at the time
I didn't understand it. I erroneously believed it to be a problem of my own
make-up, and a daily occurrence at work.
Wherever I would go, I could not
escape this very real feeling of energy depletion. The writings of Dr J. Chiappalone not only helped me to
recognize specific instances of this, but
they also helped me so that I was soon able to deal with it to such a degree
that I could prevent it to a large degree. I do not doubt I have managed the
problem, because those same people, and there were many who previously
drained me, no longer have this effect on me.
My mind is clearer, I can now
function within my work environment, and I am instantly able to recognize
those who are depleting my energies. This was perhaps my greatest obtained
liberation and freedom.
Now I can recognize that the ECP organization was all about how much energy
they could obtain from you. All the surface things, all the small truths,
all the glamour, books, teachings, lectures, smiling so-called spiritual
do-gooders, and structures were irrelevant.
After all, why else would we sit
and give incredibly intense prayer decree and mantra vigils for hours upon
hours, day after day, sometimes shouting, yelling, jumping, clapping, but
always with all of our energy from body, mind and soul, so that we would go
home literally feeling washed out and exhausted, only to have to come back
again and again and do the same thing.
Why did God need our energy we were
giving? Did he not have enough of his own? After all, he created everything
in the known and unknown universes didn't he?
Gnosticism again answers these
questions through the understanding that there are two creations and the
false creation which came about as a result of what is termed the Celestial
Error, needs the energy of the true creation to survive and it obtains it by
stealing it, for the false creation should never have existed.
I realize
these are difficult points to understand, and I urge any who want greater
understanding to read the books."
