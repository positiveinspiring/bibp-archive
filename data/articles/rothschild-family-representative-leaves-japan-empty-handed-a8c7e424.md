A senior representative of
the Rothschild banking family was in Japan
earlier this month demanding money, according to a high level source in the
Ruling Democratic Party of Japan.
When he was told the Rothschilds Japanese piggy
bank was now cut off to them, he threatened to have Japan sued for releasing
radioactivity into the ocean.
The fact the Rothschilds have had to sink to
such low level threats is a clear sign they are suffering from a serious
power loss.
The Rothschilds also need to realize that if
they are to sue anybody for the Fukushima nuclear disaster, it would be
their erstwhile US allies like
Henry
Kissinger,
J. Rockefeller and the usual
Council on Foreign Relations suspects.
In any case, this ruling party source has now
confirmed what multiple other sources say and that is that Senator J.
Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger and now Jacob Rothschild have all visited Japan
during the past month and have all left empty-handed.
What happened was that there was a show-down in the Japanese underworld and
the criminals who had been sub-contracting here for the Rockefellers and
Rothschilds etc. agreed to stop working for them. T
hat is why Emperor Akihito suddenly went
to the hospital and ceded responsibility to crown Prince Naruhito.
This was to make sure there was no royal family member available for these
Bilderberg thugs to threaten and bully.
As a result of this underground change, the
White Dragon Society has now been given
detailed information about politicians who have been bribed in the past by
the Sabbatean Jewish gangsters.
Some of the main conduits for
Rockefeller/Rothschild bribe money included,
These people are now being isolated from the
Japanese power structure.
In addition, the specific,
-
North Korean
-
Japanese
-
CIA,
...operatives responsible for the
311 Earthquake, Tsunami and Nuclear attacks on Japan
have been identified.
A representative of this group contacted the
White Dragon Society to say that while they were not proud of what they had
done, they had no choice but to follow orders or be killed.
Their identities have been given to sources in,
However, so long as they refrain from any
further such operations, they will not be prosecuted but will be asked in
the future to testify in front of a truth and reconciliation committee.
Also, some very esoteric financiers have emerged from the background as a
result of this power shift. We will not name them for now other than to
mention they are ancient European royal family foundations that have
managed to keep their names out of the headlines even as the Bilderbergers
and Rothschilds have had theirs dragged out and excoriated in public.
Connected to this there is once again talk
of trillions of dollars being readied for the good of the planet.
Talk is cheap, however, and until the money is
actually spent on ending poverty, stopping environmental destruction and
doing other good things for the planet, it remains just that: talk.
It is still not clear
when, exactly, the new financial system will be up and
running. A land-mark lawsuit that was supposed to break
the ice was promised for last week but it has failed to materialize.
The bad guys, for their part, are circling the wagons in Europe, Wall Street
and
Washington D.C.
Vast fraud continues to be reported at the
various big US and European money-center banks as well as at many of the
financial exchanges. Cabal controlled governments have also been popping
into existence in Spain, Italy, Greece and no doubt elsewhere soon too.
However, the hard reality is that Germany alone
does not have enough money to save the EU and the Euro project. The only
European power with enough cash to save the day is Russia. That is why
analysts in Asia expect Russia and Germany will eventually forge a Eurasian
Union.
Without Russian or Asian money, the North American and European powers are
now in a Wiley Coyote situation. For those of you who never saw Road Runner
cartoons as a child, Wiley Coyote would often run off a cliff and keep
running in mid-air for a while before looking down, realizing he had no
ground under his feet and falling. Creating money out of thin air by
putting numbers on computers is not reality.
Unless they embrace world peace, the Washington
and EU political apparatuses will crash-land.
The Pentagon, at least, has shown it knows what the future holds. The fact
of the matter is that the center of gravity of the world has shifted to Asia
and the United States military industrial complex needs to attach itself to
Asia in order to survive. The decision announced last week to permanently
station US troops in Australia is part of a shift from defending Europe from
Russia to defending the Chinese periphery from China.
Countries like,
-
Vietnam
-
Korea
-
Japan
-
Thailand,
...appreciate the economic good times the China
boom has brought them but they are also willing to hire US troops to ensure
their independence.
The Chinese, for their part, understand that time is on their side and the
wiser leaders there accept the need for a gradual transition of the US
military industrial complex into a peaceful organization devoted to
planetary defense and exploration of the universe.
All that said, the current US regime is in no position whatsoever to lecture
China about human rights when
Obama himself has
declared the right to kill American citizens without any trial or
legal process. The so-called Patriot act in the US is identical to the Nazi
fascist constitution and the fact of the matter is US is now ruled by a
fascist regime.
Democracy is not possible in the US with
rigged electronic polling and when over
90% of the media there is owned by five
companies all controlled by the fascist oligarchs.
Also, Australian
Anzus agents have given me evidence that
your Prime Minister Julia Gillard was undemocratically placed in power by
agents of the privately owned US Federal Reserve Board.
To conclude, a peaceful transition of the military industrial complex
is needed to prevent world war and getting Asian finance for the pentagon is
essential to that transition. My understanding is that as a part of that
transition, the Pentagon and the US agencies will be restoring
constitutional democracy to the United States.
Australia also needs to remove
the banker-selected
Gillard if it wishes to safeguard its democratic traditions.
