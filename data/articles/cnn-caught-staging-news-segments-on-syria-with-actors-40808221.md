In what can only be explained as
fake news,
CNN has resorted to actors
to stage news reports on Syria and
other topics
The primary "witness" that the mainstream media is using as a source in
Syria has been caught staging fake news segments. Recent video evidence
proves that "Syria Danny", the supposed activist who has been begging for
military intervention on CNN, is really just
a paid actor and a liar.
While Assad is definitely a tyrant like any head of state, an U.S. invasion
of the country is a worst case scenario for the people living there.
By pointing out that the mainstream media is orchestrating their entire
coverage of this incident, we are not denying that there is a tremendous
amount of death and violence in Syria
right now.
However, we are showing that the mainstream
media version of events is scripted and staged propaganda.
The following video shows him contradicting himself while off air, and even
asking crew members to "get the gunfire sounds ready" for his video
conference with
Anderson Cooper on CNN:
"Syria Danny" has also appeared on many other news programs, and every
single time his story on specific events has changed.
This is not the first time that mainstream media has been exposed as
propaganda, it happens all the time, especially during times of war.
Some of the most hyped up news images of our time surrounding war were not
actually real but were simply public relations stunts, designed as
psychological warfare operations.
No one in America can forget the image of Saddam Husseins statue being
toppled and covered with an American flag, yet few people realize that this
was a hoax, a staged psychological operation coordinated between the
military and the media.
In July of 2004 journalist Jon Elmer
exposed an internal army study of the war showing that this whole statue
scenario was indeed a set up.
In the article Elmer
writes,
"the infamous toppling of the statue of
Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in central Baghdad on April 9, 2003 was
stage-managed by American troops and not a spontaneous reaction by
Iraqis.
According to the study, a Marine colonel
first decided to topple the statue, and an Army psychological operations
unit turned the event into a propaganda moment
The Marines brought in cheering Iraqi
children in order to make the scene appear authentic, the study said.
Allegations that the event was staged were
made in April of last year, mostly by opponents of the war, but were
ignored or ridiculed by the US government and most visible media
outlets." [1]

The statue hoax was just one example in a long
list of lies and psychological operations surrounding the multiple wars in
Iraq.
At the onset of Operation Desert Storm in 1990 a
public relations firm by the name of Hill and Knowlton spent millions of
dollars on the governments behalf, constructing news pieces that would sell
the war to the American public.
One of the most moving pranks to come from
this push to war was the testimony of a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl, known only
by her first name of Nayirah.
In a videotaped testimony that was later
distributed to the media she said,
"I volunteered at the al-Addan hospital,
While I was there, I saw the Iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with
guns, and go into the room where... babies were in incubators.
They took the babies out of the incubators,
took the incubators, and left the babies on the cold floor to die."
Sounds horrible huh...?
Well, luckily it never happened, this too was a
fabricated event designed to dehumanize the Iraqi people.
The whole thing
was exposed when the journalists discovered that the witness
Nayirah was actually the daughter of an U.S. ambassador who was being coaxed
by military psychological operations specialists.
If the government and media cooperate to deceive
the American public during times of war then there should be no doubt in
your mind that the same techniques are used during times of peace, and
especially elections.
The following clip is another classic staged news segment that was aired by
CNN:
