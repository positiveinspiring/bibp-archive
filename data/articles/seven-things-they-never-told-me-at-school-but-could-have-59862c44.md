# Seven Things they Never Told Me at School - But Could Have...

1. The Importance
of Communication
We were never
told about the importance of communication or trained in this
area.
Essentially,
effective communication brings together so many different things
and therefore serves as a great life-handling tool for personal
achievement:
Communication for forming great relationships, teamwork,
solving problems, and successful project completions
are
all routed in effective communication.
2. Everything
is the Expression of Consciousness
Consistent with
the "Law
of Attraction," life shows up as a consequence of
where you are consciously at.
Your thoughts,
feelings and emotions, attitude
all contribute to how life
'shows up' for you. So, if you don't like the life you're
living, then change these things.
For example, if
you find yourself in victimhood circumstances (the symptoms of
victim consciousness) then look at where you are consciously at
and change these things.
3. Natural
Health
Like other
schools we had our share of economics teachers, but no one ever
told me that the best investment in life you could ever make is in
your health.
Because of
corporate interests, the education curriculum generally focuses
only on
pharmaceutical approaches when it comes to health.
Alternative
practitioners and great pioneers with their potentially
life-saving approaches based on natural health have been
ignored, suppressed or even unjustly ridiculed.
There are 4 things that support
good health:
Sadly, these
things are not given enough attention.
Equally sadly,
when many people are told that they have an incurable disease,
in their ignorance they fail to make the retrospective
connection - how over the years they have lacked the above 4
things and now have to pay the price as a consequence
4. Applying
Philosophy
The above box
represents all the things a person says in one day (or any given
time period). The darkened
area is the tiny proportion that represents the things a person
says that really mean something.
Do you see yourself in this
model?
In school we
never talked that much about the things that really matter in
life. No curriculum was ever set up to have conversations or
discussions with our teachers on how to handle life effectively
- how to deal with life's recurring problems such as how to make
relationships work, or how to address important subjects from a
higher perspective
i.e. the things that have significance to
all of us.
Sadly, most
people grow up, possibly out of school habit, seldom talking
about life and spending much of their time talking meaningless
nah, nah, nah nothings
and look at the result.
A world full of
people going nowhere in their lives, just like the soap opera
characters on TV
Philosophy
doesn't have to be just mere armchair discussion. It can be used
creatively to practically apply ideas in life, hence the
empowering phrase 'applying philosophy'.
5. Being
Yourself
You don't have
to just be some corporate cog-in-wheel care of the education
system's grooming. I have learned
that being yourself is your biggest strength.
More than ever,
particularly on the humanitarian front, the world needs people
able to think for themselves:
innovation and adaptability are
keys for world transformation.
Realize that
there are other ways, different to an education system that stifles
self-expression, creativity and imagination and then
churns out well-educated robotic clones unable to really think
for themselves.
As Albert
Einstein once said,
"Real
thinking is to think the unthinkable
"
History has
shown how the tiny few outside-of-the-box individuals think for
themselves and how they have contributed greatly to humanity
This is what
George Carlin had to say about the education system and why
it's so bad:
6. Having a
Deep and Genuine Love for Yourself
How do you
expect to have a deep and genuine love flowing out there with
your family, friends, groups, communities, the environment or
all things spiritual
and then have it return on you when you
had not began that deep and genuine love right there with your
own self?
This is
consistent with 2 above that life shows up as a consequence of
where
you are consciously at.
7. The Past
is Your Biggest Enemy in Life
I was never
told at school that my past can run me instead of me running it:
fear,
anxiety or an unwillingness to be creative and adventurous
are the consciousness-destroying operatives here.
But YOU are the
author of your life
