Every day in Vienna the amount of
unsold bread sent back to be disposed of is enough to supply Austria's
second-largest city, Graz.
Around 350,000 hectares of agricultural land,
above all in Latin America, are dedicated to the cultivation of soybeans to
feed Austria's livestock while one quarter of the local population starves.
Every European eats ten kilograms a year of artificially irrigated
greenhouse vegetables from southern Spain, with water shortages the result.
In WE FEED THE WORLD, Austrian filmmaker Erwin Wagenhofer traces the origins
of the food we eat. His journey takes him to France, Spain, Romania,
Switzerland, Brazil and back to Austria.
Leading us through the film is an
interview with Jean Ziegler,
the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the
'Right to Food.'
WE FEED THE WORLD is a film about food and
globalization,
fishermen and farmers, long-distance lorry drivers and high-powered
corporate executives, the flow of goods and cash flow - a film about scarcity
amid plenty.
With its unforgettable images, the film provides insight into
the production of our food and answers the question what
world hunger has to
do with us.
Interviewed are not only fishermen, farmers, agronomists,
biologists and the UN's Jean Ziegler, but also the director of production at
Pioneer, the world's largest seed company, as well as
Peter Brabeck,
Chairman and CEO of Nestl√© International, the largest food company in the
world.
