True Stories of Violation

Using data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, the ACLU has determined that
nearly 2/3 of the entire US population (197.4 million people) live within
100 miles of the US land and coastal borders.
The government is assuming extraordinary powers to stop and search
individuals within this zone. This is not just about the border: This "Constitution-Free Zone" includes most of the nation's largest metropolitan
areas.
We urge you to call on Congress to hold hearings on and pass legislation to
end these egregious violations of Americans' civil rights.
