Media Manipulation
How could such a large scale conspiracy controlling the human race occur
without the mainstream media ever noticing?
Do the manipulators have control
of the media as well?
Corporate ownership intermingled with secret society members, many of whom
are employed in the media, may explain why Bilderberg, Trilateral, and CFR
meetings are not reported by America's watchdog media.
In fact, the
membership lists of these societies read like a who's who of the mass
media.

Jim Marrs Rule by Secrecy
(107)
The Rothschilds own Associated Press and
Reuters, the two largest news
organizations in the world.
Reuters is the worlds largest international
multimedia news organization, and AP boasts being,
the backbone of the
world's information system serving thousands of daily newspaper, radio,
television and online customers with coverage in all media and news in all
formats. It is the largest and oldest news organization in the world,
serving as a source of news, photos, graphics, audio and video.
Control over the internet, publishing, recording and top cable companies
belongs to GE, Time Warner, Viacom, Disney and Newscorp.
These are directly
or indirectly owned by the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Morgans and
Oppenheimers which are all Illuminati bloodlines, and their boards of
directors look like CFR rosters.
Look at Ted Turner, the Council on Foreign
Relations member who was supposed to be taking on the system with his
Cable News Network (CNN). He sold out to Time Warner, one of the
greatest Brotherhood operations on the planet, and CNN pounds out the
official line hour after hour, day after day
The three
television networks in the United States, CBS, ABC, and NBC are controlled
by members of the
Round Table network and so are the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New
York Times, Wall Street Journal, and a long, long list of others. The same
goes for country after country.
David Icke, The Biggest Secret (272)
Instead of three competing television networks called NBC, CBS, and ABC,
what we really have is the Rockefeller Broadcasting Company, the Rockefeller
Broadcasting System, and the Rockefeller Broadcasting Consortium.
Gary
Allen, The Rockefeller File
Also note that CBS (a.k.a. Conspiracy Brainwashing Syndicate) for instance,
has over 255 radio and 200 TV affiliates nationwide, ABC has over 150 TV.
Time Inc. (Skull and Bones & CFR) owns newspapers, magazines, movie houses,
book publishers, and over thirty TV stations. These corporate giants own
every major name in media and most of the minor names as well.
As time goes
on these huge corporations continue merging, monopolizing, and buying up all
competition so that now only 5 mega-corporations, all Brotherhood controlled,
own 90% of the media.
"We know in the not too distant future, a
half dozen corporations are going
to control the media. We took this step (merger) to ensure we were one of
them.
AOL/Time Warner spokesperson.
The biggest US media giant is AOL Time Warner.
Here are the holdings of this
one company as of December 2002:
and last but not least the largest American IP, America Online.
(David Icke, Tales From Time Loop)
AOL Time Warner is followed in size by Disney, Viacom, Vivendi Universal
and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. This network dominates television,
movies and publishing. In 1997, the films produced by the four biggest
motion picture companies, Disney, Warner Brothers, Paramount (Viacom) and
Universal (Seagram) accounted for two thirds of the total boxoffice receipts
for the year. By 2003, only 20% of American' newspapers, even local ones
were not owned by the media corporations and the same can be found across
the world.
David Icke, Tales from the Time Loop
Rupert Murdochs NewsCorp dominates the American, British, Asian, and Middle
Eastern media markets. He owns 175 newspapers including The Times of London
and the New York Post, 100 cable TV channels including Fox and 19 sports
channels, 9 satellite and 40 regular TV networks, 40 publishing houses, and
a movie studio. His media empire stretches across 5
continents reaching a TV audience of 280 million in America and 300 million
in Asia. His magazines reach 28 million. With all outlets combined together,
Murdochs media empire reaches 4.7 billion people; thats Â¾ of the worlds
population.
(Rupert Murdoch: Outfoxed Documentary)
Rupert Murdoch is the most dangerous man in the world.
Ted Turner
"The mass media is itself part of the same power structure that plunders the
planet and inflicts human rights abuses on a massive scale"
David Cromwell
John Swinton, former editor of The New York Times shocked an audience of
journalists during a banquet speech when he said:
There is no such thing in
America as an independent press. You know it and I know it... The business
of the Journalist is to destroy truth; To lie outright; To
pervert; To vilify; To fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his county
and his race for his daily bread.
You know it and I know it and what folly
is this toasting an independent press? We are the tools and vassals for rich
men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and
we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property
of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.
It is a fact that
most editors and newsmen on the staffs of Life, Look, Time, Newsweek,
etc., and most editors, reporters, and commentators at NBC, CBS, and ABC
take their news and editorial cues from the New York Times.
Technically, it is a great newspaper; but it reports much of the news in
conformity with its editorial policies. The late Arthur Hays Sulzberger,
chairman of the board of the New York Times, was a member of the CFR, and
today there are at least 11 people in high positions with e Times who are
CFR members.
Sulzberger's son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos (CFR) succeeded him as
publisher. The current publisher is Arthur Ochs Punch Sulzberger (CFR).
Other CFR members at the Times are: Harding Bancroft,
Executive Vice President. James Reston, Vice President and columnist; A. M.
Rosenthal, managing editor; Seymour Topping, assistant managing editor; Max
Frankel, Sunday editor; Harrison Salisbury, associate editor; C. L.
Sulzberger, columnist; and David Halberstam, columnist.
Gary Allen, The
Rockefeller File
Running a close second to the New York Times in the prestige race is the
Washington Post. Every Senator and Congressman, regardless of his party or
political persuasion, has the Post on his desk each morning.
Like the Times,
the Post is read by the
people who count when it comes to running the country. The Post's owner and
publisher Katharine Graham is a member of the CFR, as are other top editors
and management personnel. For years the Post has been referred to as the
uptown Daily Worker.
The only time the Post has ever opposed big
governments when it has been used to investigate Communism. When this has
happened, the people at the Post frantically start waving the Constitution
and babbling about freedom of speech something they regularly suppress
when it involves opposition to fascism socialism or the Rockefellers.
Gary
Allen, The Rockefeller File
The owner/publisher of the Washington Post from 1963 2001, Katharine Graham
was a member of the
CFR,
Trilateral Commission and
Bilderberg Group!
In 1988
in a speech at CIA headquarters, she bluntly stated her contorted view of
democracy when she said:
We live in a dirty and dangerous world. There are
some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt. I
believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps
to keep its secrets, and when the press can decide whether to print what it
knows.
Once again displaying the same elite philosophy of classism and
moral relativity. They justify their corruption/lying by claiming mental
superiority over the masses.
Ted Turner has been interviewed calling the
majority of humanity useless eaters.
I think we are destroying the minds of America and that has been one of my
lifelong ambitions.
John Kricfalusi, creator of The Ren and Stimpy Show
The United States has some of the dumbest people in the world. I want you
to know that we know that.
Ted Turner, CEO of AOL/Time Warner
"Our job is to give people not what they want, but what we decide they ought
to have."
Richard Salant, former President of CBS News
David Rockefeller said it all in his 1991
Trilateral Commission meeting
speech:
"We are grateful to The Washington Post, the New York Times, Time
Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our
meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years.
It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we
had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years.
But,
the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a
world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and
world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination
practiced in past centuries."
I really look with commiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens
who, reading newspapers, live and die in the belief that they have known
something of what has been passing in their times.
Thomas Jefferson
Thomas Jefferson knew, as does any historian, that what passes as todays
News/Current Affairs, rarely remains unchanged when written/remembered as
tomorrows History.
Newspapers present the official establishment position
of each days events, but this is often not the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.
President Dwight Eisenhowers speechwriter Wilson Bryan Key wrote a book
called The Age of Manipulation all about his experience writing
presidential speeches:
"For thirty-six sleepless hours, three writers turned out draft after draft,
reviewed by a White House deputy press secretary who offered terse comments
like, 'Much too specific!' 'Ease up on factual references!' and 'Take it
back and fuzz it up!' 'Fuzz it up,' we discovered eventually, meant avoid
all clear, factual statements about anything more specific than the time of
day... The speech was endlessly discussed for likely audience reactions,
belief and attitude reinforcements, and implied meanings... Would anyone
take the empty rhetoric seriously?
The speech read smoothly, but said
absolutely nothing about anything. This was precisely what it was intended
to say. During audience interviews after the oration, most expressed
satisfaction with the great man's words. 'Ike really gave it to them!' 'He
has my vote!' 'I like the way he thinks!' Great speech!'"
Newspaper articles are also very short, often not long enough to address the
complexities involved in each issue.
This problem is further exacerbated
with television news, where most coverage consists of 30 second sound
bytes.
Furthermore, these articles and sound bytes are often coming from speeches
and spokespeople in the Spin Room.
They actually call it the spin room,
where reporters get the spin. Spiders webs and skipping records are spun.
Why is news being associated as such?
The news is a farce. As is the case with the financial institutions, which
are concentrated in the hands of the few, long ago the media was bought and
paid for...What you read and what you see on a daily basis is largely
manufactured. You are being lied to each and every day.
Christopher Mark,
Grand Deception: The Theft of America and the World (1617)
The mainstream media will lie outright, but more often lies by omission, by
suppression of dissent, or casting dissenters in a negative light, often
with one-sided editorializing.
They lie by giving uneven and incomplete
coverage. Most news articles accurately report the event, but due to limited
space cannot report on the history of each situation.
This creates a
quasi-informed populous that is constantly strung along with each days
events; people who feel informed, but remain confused and unable to piece
together the conspiratorial control manipulating their minds daily.
Another method of manipulation is the old Hegelian Dialectic
control/create both the proper thesis and antithesis to get the desired
synthesis result. In the corporate sphere there is Coke/Pepsi,
McDonalds/Burger King etc. creating the false dichotomies, the illusions of
choice. In the political sphere the bloodlines/societies put members on both
sides to control the spectrum.
In the media it is no different.
Both parties
have long used the media to build the perception of opposing positions on
key issues, meanwhile building consensus on other non-debated issues critical
to social change.
This is verified in the Congressional Record for 1917,
when Congressman Callawayx reported that:
"In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests, the steel, shipbuilding, and
powder interest, and their subsidiary organizations, got together 12 men
high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most
influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to
control generally the policy of the daily press...
They found it was only
necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers. An agreement
was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the
month; an editor
was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information
regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies, and
other things of national and international nature considered vital to the
interests of the purchasers.
U.S. Congressman Oscar Callawayx, 1917
"J. P. Morgan and his associates financed the Republican Party, the
Democratic Party, conservative groups, liberal organizations, communist
groups and anticommunist organizations."
Dr. Stanley Monteith, Brotherhood
of Darkness
The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and
policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish
idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the
two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can
throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound or
extreme shifts in policy.
Carroll Quigley, Tragedy and Hope
By creating false dichotomies and maintaining the illusion of opposites, it
is easy to herd human thought, to dampen intuition and lateral thinking.
David Icke calls them opposames.
For instance, they say the far left is
communism, and the far right is fascism, both meaning dictatorial government
control.
Then through this false thesis/antithesis they promote the
synthesis: socialist democracy, a perceived middle ground, which in reality
is just another system of dictatorial government control. Where is anarchy
on such a scale? Where is a constitutional republic, as America is supposed
to be, on that scale?
There is no place for non-establishment ideas when the
establishment creates false dichotomies that the public perceive as polar
opposites.
They suppress dissent through omission and promote both sides of
the coin they own.
Every day on television stations all over the world, journalists and
correspondents give their viewers the official version of the event they are
reporting. White House sources say this..., the Prime Minister says
that..., the FBI say the other... In all my
time in journalism I cannot recall a single conversation in a newsroom that
didnt reflect the official version of life and the world.
Most journalists
are not manipulating, they are simply stunningly uninformed and often
incredibly arrogant. They believe that if anything of magnitude was going on
they would know about it because they are journalists. In truth they are
the last to know.
David Icke, The Biggest
Secret (271)
While the media obviously cannot dictate how we are to think, they
certainly set the agenda on what we are to think about. Who has time for
tedious stories of government conspiracies and financial manipulations when
the newspapers and airwaves are filled with crime, accidents, and
celebrities?
Who bothers to notice when a primetime TV network news break
contains nothing but sports scores?
Jim Marrs, Alien Agenda (xii)
Nephew of Sigmund Freud, known as the Western Goebells, the mastermind of
modern American Propaganda, Edward Bernays was 104 when he died in 1995.
In
his century behind the scenes, Edward Bernays worked with many corporations
and the government to advertise and propagandize the American public into
different groupthink patterns. Among others he was top advisor to William
Paley, the founder of CBS.
He wrote in his 1928 book Propaganda:
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of organized habits and opinions
of the
masses is an important element in a democratic society. Those who manipulate
this
unseen mechanism of society
constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power in our
country
We are governed, our
minds are molded, our tastes
formed, our ideas suggested largely
by men we have never heard of
we
are dominated by a relatively small
number of persons who understand
the mental processes and social
patterns of the masses.
It is they
who pull the wires which control the
public mind and who harness social
forces and contrive new ways to bind
and guide the world
It remains a
fact in almost every act of our daily
lives, whether in the sphere of
politics or business, in our social
conduct or our ethical thinking, we
are dominated by this relatively
small number of persons
As
civilization has become more complex, and as the need for invisible
government has
been increasingly demonstrated, the technical means have been invented and
developed by which opinion may be regimented.
I know the secret of making the average American believe anything I want
him to. Just let me control television. Americans are wired into their
television sets. Over the last 30 years, they have come to look at their
television sets and the images on the screen as reality. You put something
on television and it becomes reality.
If the world outside the television
set contradicts the images, people start changing the world to make it more
like the images and sounds of their television. Because its influence is so
great, so pervasive, it has become part of our lives.
You lose your sense of
what is being done to you, but your mind is being shaped and molded.
Hal
Becker, Futures Group thinktank veteran
These individuals, they do go back
a long way and they have understood completely your psyche, theyve had
generations, centuries to study it.
Their type of sorcery involves different
kinds of techniques but its still the same effect: TeleHypnosis,
Metacontrast, Hemisync, Synaesthesia, Embedding, new names, new terms for a
very old, well-known practice to get you into groupthink, into subservience,
to get you to embody dialectical divisions of which there is no end in our
society, to fashion your allegiances for you, to implant associations that
your mind might not normally associate, to purvey escapism, rampant escapism
and projection of fantasy into reality, to inflate false personas so you
dont have to be you, you can live it out through the person on the screen,
and the excessive eroticization especially of the female.
Michael Tsarion,
The Subversive Use of Sacred Symbolism in the Media Lecture at Conspiracy
Con 2003
The word media comes from Media, an ancient place in the middle east near
Libya.
The Medes were an ancient cult involved in the same activities
practiced today by the modern media:
In Media were the sorcerers and astrologers, not necessarily negative
people but a tribe, a very adept cult from the ancient world who specialized
in the use of talismans, amulets, mantras and sorcery. And the kings of the
world knew that if battle hadnt
worked, or if legal means hadnt worked to get rid of an enemy, or you
didnt want it known that you were getting rid of your enemy, you simply
called on the Medes.
And you bring the representative of the Media into your
court and he will take care of the problem because he is going to put the
spell on your enemy, the hex, because they know how to do it.
And thats
where we get the word
Mediterranean, Mediation Meditation, and Medication, the Medics.
Study this
alone and a whole interesting subject will open itself up, because we still
have the sorcerers and the voodoo and the witch doctor, we still have it
today only now its the Techno Shamanism, its the Silicon Sorcerers, its
the Ivory Tower Witchdoctors and theyre still very busy at what theyre
doing up at Madison Avenue and behind the other great corporate giants who
are only too happy to tell you what to think.
Michael Tsarion, The
Subversive Use of Sacred Symbolism in the Media Lecture at Conspiracy Con
These Median sorcerers and other wizards of old often carried magical wands
as well, wooden staffs from which to cast their spells.
These were always
made of just one certain kind of wood: holly. Hollywood.
Merlin and the old magicians of Celtic England always used their magic
wands and these magic wands were always made out of holly wood. And that's
why today we still have Hollywood, working its magic on us
- showing us in movies how to view things, what we should think, or just
offering us a big box office diversion.
Jordan Maxwell, Matrix of Power
So we still find that those magi in the movie business are putting their
spells on us. The makers of cinema know all about the libido, sexuality,
desires and drives of the human beings that they are trying to pacify and
control. The fact that programs are called programs is fascinating in
itself. Programs are what one puts in a computer. They see the human mind as
a computer and have been putting in their programs every day for decades.
