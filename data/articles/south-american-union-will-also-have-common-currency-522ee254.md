Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva
recently revealed that the South American countries are planning for a
common currency as part of the integration of the individual countries into
the Union of South American Nations. This integration is patterned after the
formation of the European Union, and parallels the plan for the North
American Union.
The union of South American nations would create a trade block designed to
be competitive with the European and North American trade blocks. Central to
the formation of the union is the creation of a central bank to oversee the
new common currency that would replace the currencies of the individual
countries in the block. In a recent broadcast, President Lula stated that he
sees the implementation of this plan as not being a fast one.
In his message, the president stressed the need to help the countries of
South America that are economically weak, such as Paraguay, Uruguay and
Bolivia.
"We have to help them because the stronger
the countries in South America economically are, the more tranquility,
peace, democracy, trade, companies, jobs, incomes and development", he
is quoted
here.
Another unfolding feature of the South American
Union similar to that of the
North American Union is its dependence on newly
created infrastructure.
The South American alliance will promote the
cross-nation construction of railroads, highways, bridges and transmission
lines that will connect the entire region resulting in smooth interaction
and movement within the trading block. The NAFTA and CAFTA Superhighways
epitomize the infrastructural development of the North American Union
trading block.
The union plan also calls for a regional defense council, apparently the
beginning of the imposition of a regional government. This council would
resolve regional conflicts, promote military cooperation and allow for the
regional coordination of weapons production, much as the military
integration of Canada and the U.S. initiates the unification of governments
in the North American Countries.
The plan to establish a new common currency for the Union of South American
Nations is the latest development in the initiation of common currencies
representative of multi-country trading blocks.
The Euro was the first trade
block currency, established as part of the European Union.
The Amero is the
name of what may be the North American Union's counterpart to the Euro,
debuting after economic integration and homogenization of Mexico, the U.S.
and Canada have been completed, at exchange rates that represent the lowered
standard of living of the Americans and the Canadians.
Critics of the Union of South American Nations' efforts to establish a
common currency see it as playing right into the hands of
the world banking
cartel.
The clustering and assimilation of currencies
facilitates the eventual merger into a one world currency promoted by the
Council on Foreign Relations and its political puppets. They see the move
toward the South American Union with its single currency as easily fitting
with the European Union and current efforts to establish the North American
Union.
Once the formation of these major trading blocks is completed, the
next step would be the unification of the blocks into a one world
government.
This one world government is sometimes referred to as the
New World Order.
The Council on Foreign Relations has openly stated that its intentions are
to bring about the surrender of the sovereignty of the national independence
of the U.S. with the aim of creating a one world government. The Council,
referred to as CFR, has influence in all vital areas of American life and
around the world.
Members have run or are running the
major media
outlets including NBC, CBS, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and
many other publications.
CFR members dominate the political world. U.S. presidents since Franklin
Roosevelt have been CFR members, with the exception of Ronald Reagan. CFR
members also dominate the academic world, top corporations, unions and the
military. They are on the board of directors of
the Federal Reserve.
Barack
Obama and John McCain are CFR members, as well as
the Bushes and the
Clintons. There are many corporate members of the CFR.
CFR plans are not
subject to the,
-
scrutiny
-
debate
-
vote of the people
Discussion of the plans has been conspicuously
absent from the endless debating of the presidential candidates.
The End of National Currency

THE RISE OF MONETARY NATIONALISM
Capital flows have become globalization's Achilles' heel.
Over the past 25
years, devastating currency crises have hit countries across Latin America
and Asia, as well as countries just beyond the borders of western Europe -
most notably Russia and Turkey.
Even such an impeccably credentialed
pro-globalization economist as U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Frederic Mishkin has acknowledged that,
"opening up the financial system to foreign
capital flows has led to some
disastrous financial crises causing great
pain, suffering, and even violence."
The economics profession has failed to offer anything resembling a coherent
and compelling response to currency crises.
International Monetary Fund (IMF)
analysts have, over the past two decades, endorsed a wide variety of
national exchange-rate and monetary policy regimes that have subsequently
collapsed in failure. They have fingered numerous culprits, from loose
fiscal policy and poor bank regulation to bad industrial policy and official
corruption.
The financial-crisis literature has yielded policy
recommendations so exquisitely hedged and widely contradicted as to be
practically useless.
Antiglobalization economists have turned the problem on its head by
absolving governments (except the one in Washington) and instead blaming
crises on markets and their institutional supporters, such as the IMF -
"dictatorships of international finance," in the words of the Nobel laureate
Joseph Stiglitz.
"Countries are effectively told that if they don't follow
certain conditions, the capital markets or the IMF will refuse to lend them
money," writes Stiglitz.
"They are basically forced to give up part of their
sovereignty."
Is this right? Are markets failing, and will restoring lost sovereignty to
governments put an end to financial instability?
This is a dangerous
misdiagnosis. In fact, capital flows became destabilizing only after
countries began asserting "sovereignty" over money - detaching it from gold
or anything else considered real wealth.
Moreover, even if the march of
globalization is not inevitable, the world economy and the international
financial system have evolved in such a way that there is no longer a viable
model for economic development outside of them.
