Ever notice the way certain basic human values
quietly transform into their opposite on their way to becoming national
policy?
At the human level, the immorality of murder
is
fundamental, and most people understand the insanity of armed hatred.
Keeping these dark forces under wraps is essential to the existence of human
society.
-
So why is it, then, that at the abstract level
of nationalism, those forces are honored, worshiped, saluted, extolled as
glorious, and given command of an enormous budget?
-
Why is it that their perpetuation via
increasingly sophisticated technology is equated with national security and
no one talks about the completely predictable negative consequences of
basing security on murder and hatred?
-
And why does it feel so naïve to be asking such
questions?
Its as though the arrangement was settled four
or five millennia ago.
Killing is wrong, but we have to kill one another,
you know, in self-defense, in order to survive. And hating people is wrong -
mocking them, dehumanizing them - but some people ask for it. They do it to
us, so we have no choice but to do it back.
Hate, dehumanize, eliminate our enemies and...
voila, were safe, at least for the time being. What dont you get about
that?
Criticism of such policy is generally couched in
terms that remove the alleged naïveté of the criticism, but Im wondering if
it isnt time to stare directly at the fundamental wrongness of war.
Let me
put it as nakedly as I can:
A policy of murder and hatred is, in itself,
morally wrong as well as strategically untenable.
Anything that flows from such a policy, even if
it seems to be beneficial - such as regional dominance, access to oil,
suppression of an enemys power or plain old revenge - is inherently
unstable and doomed to disastrous failure.
This may be
the way empires act,
but its bad policy. If it creates collateral damage, its bad policy.
I put it this way because Im haunted by the
statistic that U.S. military veterans are committing suicide at the rate of
18 per day and that the term for the condition of many, maybe most, veterans
and soldiers after their deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq is moral
injury, as I wrote about
last week.
Their lives have been seriously damaged not just
by physical and psychological injury but by something else as well - by
having transgressed a fundamental spiritual threshold and severed the
connection that unites us. We cant dehumanize others without doing the same
to ourselves, and waking up to the reality of such a state is sometimes
unbearable.
And its not just the deployment - the
participation in an inhumane occupation and war - that dehumanizes.
The military training that precedes deployment
is where it starts. The training is not simply in the craft and technology
of killing, but in the dehumanizing of self and other. The U.S. military,
whatever else it is, is a cult of hatred with a virtually unlimited budget.
This has been born out in the testimony of
numerous vets over the years, testimony that could fill volumes, e.g.:
I joined the Army on my 18th birthday. When
I joined I was told racism was gone from the military, Mike Prysner
said during the 2008 Winter Soldier hearings.
After 9/11, I (began hearing) towel head,
camel jockey, sand nigger. These came from up the chain of command. The
new word was hadji. A hadji is someone who takes a pilgrimage to Mecca.
We took the best thing from Islam and made it the worst thing.
Prysner was part of a panel called Racism and
War: the Dehumanization of the Enemy.
Military recruits
march to cadences that celebrate killing children in the marketplace and cry
kill before they can eat a meal. Theyre told theyre animals, stripped of
sentimental feelings, trained to kill on command with cold efficiency. In
that condition they serve U.S. foreign policy.
The argument, of course, is that we have enemies
out there who despise us and want what we have, and our only protection is a
layer of ruthless, well-armed killers that patrol the perimeter and keep our
communities and our children safe. The argument is that our foreign policy
is ultimately humane, that it spreads democracy, that it targets only bad
guys and protects decent people everywhere.
But this argument breaks down when you look at
what we do, from Dresden and Hiroshima to My Lai and Fallujah.
It breaks down when you read about the rationale
of our massive bombing of Baghdad at the start of the Iraq war, as spelled
out by Harlan K. Ullman and James P. Wade in the 1996 Defense
Department publication, Shock
and Awe - Achieving Rapid Dominance:
The intent here is to impose a regime of
Shock and Awe through delivery of instant, nearly
incomprehensible levels of massive destruction directed at influencing
society writ large, meaning its leadership and public, rather than
targeting directly against military or strategic objectives...
The employment of this capability against
society and its values, called counter-value... (consists of)
massively destructive strikes directly at the public will of the
adversary to resist.
This is the morality of empire, the morality of
domination.
We didnt invent it; we just carry on the
tradition, which goes back through colonialism and slavery to
the Inquisition (kill them all, let God
sort them out) to Rome (they create a wasteland and call it peace) and
beyond, to the dawn of civilization.
I think the consequences have finally caught up
with us.
