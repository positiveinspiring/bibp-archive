As bad as the global economy is right now, it is
unfortunately going to get far worse.
Many central banks around the world are now
racing to devalue their currencies through the implementation of debt
monetization programs and low interest rates.
Despite
statements coming out of the G20 saying otherwise, many insiders and
former insiders are
fully admitting that there is
an on-going global currency war and
that this war is accelerating.
The Bank of Japans recent announcement of
a massive bond purchase program is the latest episode in an already
sorry state of affairs.
It is a historical fact that prosperity has
never been obtained by devaluing a nations money which makes it all the
more insane that the central planners are actually trying to sell the
general public on these policies. In fact if monetary devaluation resulted
in economic growth, Zimbabwe which recently experienced a period of rampant
hyperinflation would easily be the wealthiest nation in the world instead of
one of the poorest.
Ancient Rome had a strong monetary unit when the
nation rose to prominence but degenerated after the ruling powers decided to
devalue its coinage.
In more recent times both the British Empire and
the United States reached great heights when they maintained a sound money
system. With this said, you really dont need to be an economics guru to
figure out that the result of todays monetary policies will eventually
result in a complete disaster for the global economy.
Despite all of the absurd propaganda from the
major news networks, there is no question that much of the world is in a
depression.
The only reason there has not been a total
collapse of the system is because of the fact that central banks have
maintained artificially low interest rates and propped up sovereign bond
markets by purchasing bonds with money that they created out of nothing.
Taxpayer bailouts, stimulus programs and other
nonsense havent helped matters either. These policies which were
implemented following the crash of 2008 have simply set the world up for a
much larger collapse in the future. There would have at least been an
outside chance to fix the system had the central planners not intervened but
now the situation is becoming increasingly hopeless.
Take for example what happened in Iceland
immediately following the 2008 financial crisis. The Icelandic people
voted against using taxpayer money to prop up failed Icelandic banks.
Even though there was a great deal of short term
economic pain with foreign depositors and foreign bond holders losing
billions, the
country is now on the road to recovery.
On the other hand, Ireland which decided to
bailout its banking system with taxpayer money is still dealing with the
after effects of the crisis. In 2010, Ireland actually had to accept a
bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund because
the government could no longer afford the burden.
Just weeks ago thousands of people rightfully
filled the streets of Irish cities
protesting against the bank bailouts.
Before the bailouts, Ireland had one of the
stronger economies in the European Union with one of the lowest debt-to-GDP
ratios in Europe. After the bailouts, the Irish economy has struggled even
being mentioned in the same breath as Spain and Greece.
Sadly even with all of these monetary stimulus
programs, the United States economy is barely treading water. It was
recently reported that the U.S. economy shrunk 0.1 percent in Q4 of 2012
according to official numbers from the U.S. Commerce Department.
Considering economic statistics from the
government are questionable at best, it is quite possible that the real
numbers are far worse. If the U.S. economy is actually shrinking with these
types of monetary policies in place, it is painfully obvious that the
Federal Reserve has no exit strategy from the status quo.
Any attempt to defend the value of the U.S.
Dollar by suspending debt purchases and raising interest rates would send
the economy into a tailspin.
Ben Bernanke
the Federal Reserve Chairman once
famously said that he would
throw money out of a helicopter to keep the economy going so we should
fully expect him to continue these activities.
In fact, we already know through the Federal
Reserves own policy statements that they will be
continuing near zero interest rate policies well into the future.
At this point thats really all they can do
since it is politically infeasible for them to tighten the purse strings so
they just continue to print more and more money out of nothing.
The Federal Reserves bond purchasing programs
have effectively fueled a rally in bonds pushing yields of various U.S.
government debt instruments towards historical lows. This has fooled people
into believing that U.S. government debt is a safe haven play which is
astounding on so many levels. The rate of return on these debt instruments
is actually negative when factoring in the real rate of inflation.
The government and establishment media love to
tout the Consumer Price Index or
CPI as the ultimate gauge of inflation.
However, the CPI
doesnt
even include food and energy in its calculation thus making it a
completely worthless indicator of true inflation.
Maybe if people didnt eat, didnt use oil to
heat their homes and didnt fill their automobiles with gasoline the CPI
might have some relevance.
In reality, theres little question that that
the CPI is a purposely manipulated figure designed to mislead people into
believing that inflation is lower than it actually is. The CPI also provides
the basis for cost of living adjustments that directly affects how much
money Social Security recipients receive. This allows the government to get
away with paying far less than if real inflation was used as the benchmark
to calculate these adjustments.
The true measure of inflation calculated using
the same statistical models used by the U.S. government during the 1970s has
inflation closer to 10% on an annual basis.
Even if we were to assume that inflation is half
of that figure, U.S. Treasury bond holders would still be getting a negative
rate of return on their investment.
Cleary, this is a dangerous game that is being
played by the world's central banks. Looking specifically at the Fed they
announced late last year that they would be
purchasing $85 billion worth of securities on a monthly basis for an
indefinite period of time until unemployment is substantially reduced.
This adds up to roughly $1 trillion worth of
bond purchases per year which is approximately what the federal governments
annual budget deficit has been under the Obama regime. The Fed is
essentially monetizing enough debt for the federal government to finance its
$1 trillion annual budget deficit. In other words they are creating close to
$1 trillion new dollars out of nothing and dumping it into the system.
The end result is that you have a larger supply
of dollars chasing the same goods and services which ultimately means there
will be higher prices because each dollar will be worth less.
This policy is essentially an invisible tax on
the average person because it robs them of their purchasing power. Combine
this with the fact that
the Obama regime actually raised taxes on poor and middle class
Americans as part of the recent fiscal cliff deal and the additional burden
Obamas universal healthcare plan has placed on businesses and it is no
wonder why the economy is sputtering.
Not only is the currency being devalued but they
are financially damaging the base from which they collect taxes.
Evidence of this economic reality can be seen
from a leaked internal e-mail from a Wal-Mart Vice President who stated
that sales were a total disaster and that February 2013 sales were off to
its slowest start in the 7 years hes been with the company. Since average
people now have less purchasing power to buy things with, it shouldnt be
any surprise that we see reports like this.
One would think sanity would prevail and the
Obama regime would at least end the costly foreign wars and make a few
domestic spending cuts. Since we live in a world where insanity seems to be
the prevailing thought process, we are not going to see this happen. At the
recent State of the Union speech Obama actually proposed more spending
programs including a
ridiculous multi-billion dollar universal preschool initiative.
With a debt over $16 trillion, unfunded
liabilities that some have argued approach $100 trillion or higher and $1
trillion annual budget deficits where do they think theyll get the money to
pay for these new programs?
Either this is pure stupidity of the most epic
magnitude or they are intentionally trying to destroy whats left of the
economy. Regardless of what you believe, these policies are leading us
towards disaster.
As a result of these crazy policies, huge
bubbles are being created in the U.S. Treasury bond market, the U.S. stock
market and most importantly in the U.S. Dollar itself. Since the Fed is
buying an increasing amount of bonds it has artificially propped up the
market causing investors to venture into the stock market for greater
returns on investment which has resulted in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
hitting the 14,000 level.
Contrary to what the talking head clowns on CNBC
say, this is not the sign of a healthy economy but instead an indicator of
gross manipulations by the Fed which has forced investors to take on more
risk to achieve any real rate of return.
At some point the market is going to reject
these policies when fewer and fewer market participants are willing to
purchase U.S. Treasury bonds at historically low yields while the U.S.
Dollar is simultaneously devalued. This alone will cause the bond bubble to
burst, yields to skyrocket and force the U.S. government to pay even more
money to service the interest on the debt.
Considering that the U.S. government is already
having a difficult time making payments to service the debt with
historically low yields, any reversal would be extremely problematic.
It is comical that there are still ratings
agencies that rate U.S. sovereign debt with a Triple-A status considering
the train wreck we are witnessing. S&P which was the one ratings agency that
actually downgraded U.S. sovereign debt is now being
sued by the U.S. government over inaccurate securities ratings leading
up to the 2008 financial crisis.
This is not an attempt to defend S&P by any
means, but there are a number of questions as to why they are the only
ratings agency being sued. All of the big ratings agencies were guilty of
grossly exaggerating the quality of different types of securities in the
years leading up to the 2008 financial crash.
The only thing that differentiates S&P from the
other ratings agencies is that they had the nerve to downgrade U.S.
sovereign debt. This lawsuit appears to be retaliation against them for that
downgrade and nothing else. If this isnt the case, than why havent
lawsuits been filed against all of the major ratings agencies?
Clearly, each one of them was involved in some
sort of chicanery leading up to the crash. With this said, there is no
reason to trust what any of these major ratings firms are saying about U.S.
sovereign debt. It is highly probable that their ratings of U.S. sovereign
debt are being affected by the possibility that the U.S. government would
threaten legal action against them if they fail to provide a favorable
analysis.
It is also becoming more apparent that the
central planners have been suppressing the gold and silver price as part of
an effort to maintain the illusion that these debt based currencies still
have value.
The German Bundesbank recently
announced its intention to take delivery of over half of its gold
reserves by 2020 from the Fed and other central banks.
The main question here is why would it take 7
years to complete this process? China has been
buying huge sums of physical gold on the open market and so far have had
no logistical problems receiving prompt delivery of their gold.
This gives additional credence to the
accusations that central banks have been leasing out physical gold as part
of a scam to suppress the price. In other words, the gold that Germany is
requesting delivery of is no longer available which is why the gold cannot
be immediately delivered.
In all likelihood, this is why an agreement was
struck to deliver the gold over 7 years so the central banks could save face
without having to transparently expose the gold manipulation fraud they are
engaged in.
Either way, it is quite obvious that the gold
and silver markets have both been manipulated for some time now.
If you
study the daily charts of gold and silver there are often huge price
disruptions to the down side that have no fundamental explanation. If other
countries follow suit and request physical delivery of their gold, this
could put an end to these suppression schemes resulting in a massive upswing
in the price of gold.
It is often said that gold goes where wealth is
being generated. If we use that as a measuring stick it is clear that wealth
is being transferred from the west over to Asia. Specifically of interest is
the fact that gold is being purchased in large sums by both the Chinese and
Russian governments.
There is even speculation that the Chinese are
preparing to
officially back the Yuan with gold. We also see huge gold demand from
India whose gold imports
surged 23% this past January.
In fact gold demand has been so strong that
India just
raised taxes on gold imports to try to reduce demand.
Unfortunately for the west, these countries that
are net buyers of gold are going to be in a very good financial position
once the full effect of these debt monetization and low interest policies
are felt. Gold is real money and stores value unlike the debt based garbage
that these central banks are creating by typing digits into a computer.
There is very little question that the global
financial system is at a point where it cannot be repaired.
The policies of unlimited money creation that
are currently being implemented by the Fed and other central banks are
unfortunately going to continue until the entire system collapses. It is now
inevitable that there will be a huge crash in the U.S. stock market, the
U.S. bond market and eventually the U.S. Dollar.
Gold, silver and other precious metals should
perform very well as this scenario unfolds so there are safe havens
available for people wishing to preserve their wealth.
It is unfortunate that the only question
remaining now is not if this collapse is going to happen but when this
collapse is going to happen.
