The following is a letter that speculation
claimed that Albert Pike wrote to Giuseppe Mazzini in 1871
regarding a conspiracy involving three world wars that were planned in an
attempt to take over the world.
The Pike letter to Giuseppe Mazzini was
on display in the British Museum Library in London until 1977.
This letter
has been claimed by many internet sites to reside in the British Library in
London, which denies the letter exists.
-
Giuseppe Mazzini was an Italian
revolutionary leader of the mid 1800s as well as the Director of the
Illuminati
-
Albert Pike (historical Masonic figure) is a 33rd degree, Freemason
Occultist Grand Master and creator of the Southern Jurisdiction of the
Masonic Scottish Rite Order
Following are apparently extracts from the letter, showing how Three World
Wars have been planned for many generations.
"The First World War must be brought
about in order to permit the Illuminati to overthrow the power of the
Czars in Russia and of making that country a fortress of atheistic
Communism. The divergences caused by the "agentur" (agents) of the
Illuminati between the British and Germanic Empires will be used to
foment this war. At the end of the war, Communism will be built and used
in order to destroy the other governments and in order to weaken the
religions."
"The Second World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the
differences between the Fascists and the political Zionists. This war
must be brought about so that Nazism is destroyed and that the political
Zionism be strong enough to institute a sovereign state of Israel in
Palestine. During the Second World War, International Communism must
become strong enough in order to balance Christendom, which would be
then restrained and held in check until the time when we would need it
for the final social cataclysm."
"The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the
differences caused by the "agentur" of the "Illuminati" between the
political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be
conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and
political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other.
Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be
constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual
and economical exhaustion
We shall unleash the Nihilists and the
atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in
all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute
atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil.
Then
everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world
minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of
civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with christianity, whose
deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction,
anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration,
will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the
pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view.
This
manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which
will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered
and exterminated at the same time."

Albert Pike's
Biography
extract from
Wikipedia
Pike was born in Boston, Massachusetts, son of Ben and Sarah (Andrews) Pike,
and spent his childhood in Byfield and Newburyport, Massachusetts.
His
colonial ancestors included John Pike (1613-1688/1689), the founder of
Woodbridge, New Jersey. He attended school in Newburyport and Framingham
until he was fifteen. In August 1825, he passed his entrance exams and was
accepted at Harvard University, though when the college requested payment of
tuition fees for the first two years, he chose not to attend.
He began a
program of self-education, later becoming a schoolteacher in Gloucester,
North Bedford, Fairhaven and Newburyport.
In 1831, Pike left Massachusetts to travel west, first stopping in St. Louis
and later moving on to Independence, Missouri. In Independence, he joined an
expedition to Taos, New Mexico, hunting and trading. During the excursion
his horse broke and ran, forcing Pike to walk the remaining 500 miles to
Taos. After this he joined a trapping expedition to the Llano Estacado in
New Mexico and Texas.
Trapping was minimal and, after traveling about 1300
miles (650 on foot), he finally arrived at Fort Smith, Arkansas.
Settling in Arkansas in 1833, he taught school and wrote a series of
articles for the Little Rock Arkansas Advocate under the pen name of "Casca."
The articles were popular enough that he was
asked to join the staff of the newspaper. Later, after marrying Mary Ann
Hamilton, he purchased part of the newspaper with the dowry. By 1835, he was
the Advocate's sole owner.
Under Pike's administration the Advocate promoted
the viewpoint of the Whig party in a politically volatile and divided
Arkansas
