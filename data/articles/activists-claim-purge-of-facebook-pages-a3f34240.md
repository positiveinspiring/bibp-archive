Activists are claiming that dozens of
politically linked
Facebook accounts have been removed or suspended by the
company in the last 12 hours.

The
list of suspended pages include those for the anti cuts group
UK Uncut, and
pages that were created by students during last December's university
occupations.
A list posted on
the UCL occupation blog site says the pages,
-
Goldsmiths Fights Back
-
Slade Occupation
-
Open Brikbeck
-
Tower Hamlet Greens,
as no longer functioning.
It is not yet known how many websites have been affected in total or why
they are not working. Facebook is currently looking into the issue.
Guy Aitchison, 26, an administrator for one of the non-functioning
pages said,
"I woke up this morning to find that a lot
of the groups we'd been using for anti-cuts activity had disappeared.
The timing of it seems suspicious given a general political crackdown
because of the royal wedding."
"It seems that dozens of other groups have also been affected, including
some of the local UK Uncut groups."
Earlier, it was reported that the Metropolitan
police had
invoked special powers to deter anarchists in central London
ahead of the royal wedding.
Police threw a section 60 cordon around the whole of the royal wedding zone
on Friday morning to respond to anarchists masking up at a small gathering
in Soho Square in central London.
The section 60 order allows police officers to stop and search anyone
without discretion. The police also imposed section 60a, which gives them
the power to remove masks and balaclavas from anyone within the area.
Scotland Yard said the decision was made after individuals were seen putting
on masks in Soho Square where a group of anarchists had gathered.
The Guardian is awaiting a comment from Facebook.
