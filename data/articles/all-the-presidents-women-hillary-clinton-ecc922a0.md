Obama has followed a pattern of surrounding
himself with outwardly charming and intelligent women, but women,
nonetheless, who have a very dark criminal side to both their past and
present affairs.
The More Things Change, the More
They Stay the Same
In a case of the more things change, the more
they stay the same, the scope of
Hillary Clintons criminality cannot be
covered in one article.
In fact, I doubt that it could be covered in one
book. The body count stories alone,
associated with both Hillary and Bill,
could fill volumes. By some estimates, the body count now tops
85 victims.
Therefore, in the interest of brevity, a brief comparison will be made
between the Clinton Whitewater affair and the Benghazi murders of Ambassador
Stevens and three other Americans.
The undeniable conclusion that the reader
will draw from these two comparative cases is that Hillary Clinton, one the
Presidents top cabinet members, is, has been and probably always will be a
sociopathic criminal with no conscience.
Whitewater and the Missing
Billing Records
For those who were old enough to remember, you
will recall that
Whitewater was a real estate development in Arkansas which
became a nightmarish scandal for Bill and Hillary when it became insolvent.
Clintons partner, Jim McDougal, owned a savings
and loan association (i.e. Madison Guaranty) that hired Hillary and her
firm, the
Rose Law Firm.
When the Savings and Loan institution failed,
costing taxpayers $65 million, the Whitewater vacation development project
collapsed as well. Hillary stated 99 times under oath in 1996, that she did
not recall what work she did for
Madison Guarantee.
This is a stellar case in point why I believe that
Hillary will never tell what she REALLY knows about the death of Ambassador
Chris Stevens.
After six hearings and $40 million dollars of
investigations, Special Prosecutor,
Ken Starr did not determine that the Clintons were innocent of criminal
wrongdoing when he concluded that,
This office has determined that the
evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
that either President or Mrs. Clinton knowingly participated in any
criminal conduct
or knew of such conduct.
Prosecutors had previously subpoenaed Hillarys
billing records from Madison.
However, Hillary continued to lie as she
reported that she couldnt find them. Two years later, the records turned up
in the White House family residence under circumstances that Hillary has
never been able to fully explain. Why she did not go to jail is a mystery.
The best case scenario was that the Clintons
were lying under oath and obstructing justice, just like Hillary is doing
today with regard to the Chris Stevens murder.
The Whitewater Body Count
-
John Wilson was found dead from an apparent
hanging suicide on May 18, 1993. He was a former Washington DC council
member and claimed to have information on Whitewater at the time of his
death.
-
Jon Parnell Walker was an investigator for the RTC who was looking into the linkage between the Whitewater and Madison
Savings & Loan bankruptcy.
Walker fell from the top of the Lincoln Towers
Building.
-
Stanley Huggins was a principal in a Memphis law
firm which headed a 1987 investigation into the loan practices of Madison
Guaranty Savings & Loan.
Stanley died in Delaware in July 1994 and the
highly questionable reported cause of death was viral pneumonia.
Jim McDougal
-
Jim McDougal was a close friend of Bill
and Hillary Clinton. He was also their banker, and political ally prior to
being sent to prison for eighteen felony convictions for his Whitewater
related actions.
A key Whitewater witness, McDougal died of a
heart attack on March, 8 1998, while, unexplainably, being held in solitary
confinement. Solitary confinement? I thought high profile prisoners like
McDougal went to Club Fed to serve out their terms, not solitary
confinement.
Of course, in solitary confinement, there are no witnesses to
murder. McDougal was in position to have had intimate knowledge of Hillarys
Whitewater affairs, but dead men tell no tales.
-
Johnny Lawhon died on March 29, 1998.
The
former Arkansas transmission specialist who discovered a pile of Whitewater
documents in the trunk of an abandoned car on his property and turned them
over to Ken Starr. Lawhon was killed in a car wreck two weeks after the
McDougal death.
Details of the accident have remained
suspicious.
Clinton Is Backed By Criminals
Norman Hsu, major Campaign
Contributor to Hillary Clinton
Both of the Clintons have a long history of
questionable criminal associations.
Because this is an article and not a
book, I will use the Hsu case as an example of the many criminal
associations that Hillary Clinton has participated in.
The infamous
Norman Hsu became one of Hillarys
biggest fundraisers in which he donated over $850,000 to her campaign, and
his donations continued to the day that Hsu surrendered to the California
State Superior Court after
being found guilty of a Grand Theft conviction.
Hsu had been a fugitive from justice for over 15
years. Hus became a fugitive when he failed to appear for sentencing by the
court after pleading no contest to the Grand Theft charges.
You might want
to loosen your collar and adjust your eyeglasses. This means that Hillary
Clinton was accepting money from a convicted criminal who was evading
justice during the same exact time frame.
Hsus crime was connected to raising more than a
million dollars from investors for a phony business scheme which didnt
exist.
And true to the criminal nature of
the Obama
Administration, Hsu also gave $18,000 to Barack Obama election campaign.
One is judged by the company

The Benghazi Murders
There is now proof that
Obama was warned in advance of the coming attack in which Stevens begged
for more protection and his impassioned plea was denied by Clinton.
From the preceding video, it is clear that a
drone was released to the scene of the murder of Ambassador Stevens and
Obama and his staff watched as four Americans were murdered.
Obama later claimed that there was not time to
launch a rescue mission. This is a blatant lie because if a drone can reach
the scene and video the events, fighter planes could have reached the scene
and intervened, which could have been followed up with a rapid deployment
force trained in rescue.
We now know that General Hamm, former commander of AFRICOM, against Obamas orders, was preparing to launch a rescue mission
when he was arrested and relieved of command.
As Stevens was begging for help after the attack
had begun, General Hamm had activated a special forces team within minutes
of learning that the embassy, which was really a
CIA safe house, was under attack.
General Hamm
When General Hamm received his stand down
orders from Panetta on behalf of Obama, he defiantly made plans to go ahead
with the rescue and was arrested within minutes of contravening the order by
his second in command, General Rodriquez.
Out to sea, Admiral Gayouette, the commander of
Carrier Strike Group Three, was preparing to provide intelligence and air
cover for General Hamms rescue team in violation of his standing orders and
he was promptly relieved of command "for allegations of inappropriate leadership judgment.
Both men are
being held today in undisclosed locations.
As an aside, if there is any kind of a silver
lining in these very dark clouds it appears that much of the senior military
leadership has had enough of the traitorous Obama and his den of corrupt
criminals and some of them are willing to risk career in the name of
actually serving the American people.
Admiral Gayoutte
The evidence is clear. Clinton knew that Stevens
was in grave danger and ordered extra security. Obama refused to support Clinton, purposely
leaving Stevens exposed.
At this point, Clinton had a choice
-
Does she go along to get along and
become an accomplice to murder?
-
Or, does she resign and refuse to go
along with the murderous intentions of Panetta and Obama?
Even if Clinton had resigned that should not
have been enough to avoid criminal charges of depraved indifference by
failing to report a crime that she knew was going to happen and then did
take place.
Clinton had both a moral and legal imperative to
resign and then tell what she knew.
General Ham and Admiral Gayouette are
clearly men who understand their moral and legal imperatives. They refused
to obey an unlawful and unconstitutional order. Clinton, true to her
criminal background and history of inappropriate choices, chose to go along,
to get along.
There can be no doubt that Clinton would have
had limited options if she would have displayed the courage of Hamm and
Gayoutte and refused to obey an illegal order from Obama through Panetta. I
also understand that it would have been gut wrenching to decide where would
she could have gone with this information?
The logical choice is Eric Holder, the
Attorney General.
However, with Holders complicity in
Fast and Furious,
Clinton would have known that Holder was not an option and that he is just
as corrupt as Obama. She could not have gone to the FBI, because it is
controlled by the President. Local law enforcement has no jurisdiction.
Now, before you start to feel sorry for Clinton,
please realize that Congress threw her a lifeline.
Clintons supporters have told me that her life
would have been in danger, if she tells all to Congress, and my answer
response is,
You mean in the same way that Chris Stevens
life was in danger?
The Clot Heard Around the World
Leaders are supposed to possess both moral and
physical courage.
Do not feel sorry for Clinton, she was not
totally without options. Congress gave her a chance to save her reputation
and possibly her legal rear end. She could have told what she knew
about Obama and Panetta being the butchers of Benghazi. Hillarys testimony
could have brought down this criminal administration.
Instead, we find a
Secretary of State who developed the Benghazi flu and could not testify.
And when this strategy, designed to avoid
congressional testimony, wore thin, Clinton demonstrated that she has a
better head fake than hall of fame basketball star, Michael Jordan, when she
suddenly developed an alleged blood clot near the brain.
Clinton is still putting her political career
and her loyalty to the democratic party ahead of her oath of office.
Anyone, who has an IQ higher than room
temperature, knows that Obama and Panetta let Stevens be murdered and their
intent was deliberate. So, rather than doing the right thing, Clinton wants
to appear to be protecting the President and ultimately the Democratic
party.
In my opinion, Clinton is taking the political bullet so she can
retain support from her party in order that she can run in 2016 with full
party support.
Meanwhile, Obama and Panetta made a decision to
let Stevens get murdered to make the trail of evidence go cold with regard
to their illegal gun running operations to Al-Qaida, into Syria via Turkey,
in this Middle East version of Fast and Furious.
And Hillary simply goes along to get along.
In the aftermath of Stevens murder, here sits
Hillary Clinton placing her personal political ambition over the life of an
ambassador who did not have to die. She is still breaking the law by
obstructing justice and not telling what she knows.
In short, Hillary
Clinton is a criminal to the end.
Ironically, if Clinton had done the right thing
with regard to the murders of these four Americans, people like myself might
have softened our views on her past criminality.
However, at the end of the day, America needs to
face the fact that Hillary Clinton is a criminal to the core.
People like her are so used to using graft,
corruption and murder, so often, to get what they want, they do not honestly
know how to pursue personal goals without invoking these variables into
their decision making.
The Benghazi Victim Trail
Ambassador Chris Stevens along with Sean Smith,
Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were killed in a planned terrorist attack in
Libya on the 11th anniversary
of 9/11.
Some of the four victims families render a harsh
verdict of the Obama Administration.
Sean Smiths mother,
Patricia Smith, has said that the president murdered her son and
Tyrone Woods
father has echoed her sentiment. And Hillary went along to get along.
Just Like Slick Willie, Hillary
Is Made Out of Teflon
With regard to Benghazi, will Hillary go down
with the Obama ship? It is not likely that she will have to worry about that
possibility.
As Congress buckled and allowed the Wall Street
bankers to plunder and subsequently destroy the economy through
unconstitutional and illegal bail outs, Congress will buckle again in the
Benghazi affair because they will not bite that hand that ultimately feeds
them their insider deals which leads to their insider trading opportunities
that has been admitted to by Nancy Pelosi.
If you understand the contents of this
paragraph, then you understand why
the American empire is crumbling right
before our eyes.
When one considers
the facts
in evidence,
Hillary Clinton is
an enemy
of the Republic.
