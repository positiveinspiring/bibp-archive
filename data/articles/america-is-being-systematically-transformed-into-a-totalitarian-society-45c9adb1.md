If someone were to ask you for an example of a
totalitarian society, how would you respond?
Most Americans would probably think of horribly
repressive regimes such as,
-
the Soviet Union
-
Nazi Germany
-
Communist China
-
East Germany
-
North Korea,
...but the truth is that there is one society
that has far more rules and regulations than any of those societies ever
dreamed of having.
In the United States today, our lives are
governed by literally millions of laws, rules and regulations that govern
even the smallest details of our lives, and more laws, rules and regulations
are constantly being added.
On January 1st, thousands of restrictive new
laws went into effect all over America, but most Americans have become so
accustomed to the matrix of control that has been constructed all around
them that it does not even bother them when even more rules and regulations
are put into place.
In fact, a growing number of Americans have
become totally convinced that freedom and liberty must be tightly
restricted for the good of society and that the free market is inherently
dangerous.
On the national, state and local levels,
Americans continue to elect elitist control freaks that are very eager to
tell all the rest of us how to run virtually every aspect of our lives.
According to
Merriam-Webster, the following is one of the ways that the word
totalitarian is defined:
of or relating to a political regime based
on subordination of the individual to the state and strict control of
all aspects of the life and productive capacity of the nation especially
by coercive measures.
And that is exactly what we are witnessing in
America today - nearly all aspects of our lives and of the economy are very
tightly controlled by a bunch of control freaks that just keep tightening
that control with each passing year.
We still like to call ourselves the land of the
free, but the truth is that we are being transformed into a totalitarian
society unlike anything the world has ever seen before.
Where will we end up eventually if we keep going
down this road?
If you still believe that America is free,
just consider some of the things that are illegal in America today
-
Starting on January 1st, it is now
illegal to make or import 75
watt incandescent light bulbs anywhere in the United States.
-
In
Oregon, it is illegal to collect rainwater that falls on your
own property.
-
In
New Jersey, it is illegal to have an unrestrained cat or dog
in your vehicle while you are driving.
-
If you milk your cow and sell some of
the milk to your neighbor, you could end up having your home raided
by federal agents.
-
In
Miami Beach, Florida you must recycle your trash properly or
face huge fines.
-
All over the United States, cops are
shutting down
lemonade stands run by children because they dont have the
proper permits.
-
Down in
Tulsa, Oklahoma one unemployed woman had her survival garden
brutally ripped out and carted away by government thugs because it
did not conform to regulations.
-
Over in Massachusetts, all children in
daycare centers
are mandated by state law to brush their teeth after lunch. In
fact, the state even provides the fluoride toothpaste for the
children.
-
At one public school down in Texas, a
12-year-old girl named Sarah Bustamantes was arrested
for spraying herself with perfume.
-
A 13-year-old student at a school in
Albuquerque, New Mexico was arrested by police
for burping in class.
-
All over the United States cities have
passed laws that actually make it illegal to
feed the homeless.
With each passing year, the number of decisions
that we are allowed to make for ourselves gets smaller and smaller.
This includes some really fundamental things
such as basic health decisions.
For example, the CDC will soon be recommending
that nearly every single American be vaccinated for the flu every single
year.
The following is from the article
U.S. Government Panel Now Pushing "Vaccinations For
All!" No Exceptions
An advisory panel to the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that every
person be vaccinated for the seasonal flu yearly, except in a few cases
where the vaccine is known to be unsafe.
Now no one should say Should I or
shouldnt I? said CDC flu specialist Anthony Fiore.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices voted 11-0 with one abstention to recommend yearly flu
vaccination for everyone except for children under the age of six
months, whose immune systems have not yet developed enough for
vaccination to be safe, and people with egg allergies or other health
conditions that are known to make flu vaccines hazardous.
These recommendations are often made into
mandatory requirements by school districts and employers all over the
country.
Will employers all over the nation soon require
all of their employees to take these vaccines each year based on these CDC
recommendations? This is already happening in the healthcare field.
Hundreds of healthcare professionals all over the nation
are being fired for refusing to take certain vaccines.
It doesnt matter that there is a
tremendous amount of evidence that many of
these vaccines are dangerous. Many health professionals today are being
faced with the choice of either submitting to the recommendations of the
experts or losing their jobs.
We see this kind of creeping totalitarianism
in the business world as well. As I have written about
previously, small businesses all over the country are being absolutely
suffocated by mountains of laws, rules and regulations.
One of the biggest changes that small businesses
will be dealing with in the next couple of years is
Obamacare. Many small businesses have been cutting back hours in an
attempt to get around the new requirements contained in Obamacare.
The following is one example from a news story
that was published earlier
this week
Around 100 local Wendys workers have
learned their hours are being cut. A spokesperson says a new health care
law is to blame.
Thirty-six to 37 hours a week.
Thats how many hours T.J. Growbeck works at
the 84th and Giles Wendys restaurant. The money he earns
helps him pay for the basics, but thats not the case for all his
co-workers.
There are some people doing it trying
to get by.
The company has announced that all
non-management positions will have their hours reduced to 28 a week.
Gary Burdette, Vice President of Operations
for the local franchise, says the cuts are coming because the new
Affordable Health Care Act requires employers to offer health insurance
to employees working 32-38 hours a week.
Under the current law they are not
considered full time and that as a small business owner, he cant afford
to stay in operation and pay for everyones health insurance.
But the IRS has announced that it is going to
make it very hard for employers to avoid these new Obamacare regulations.
According to new IRS rules, all firms that,
have at least 50 full-time employees or an
equivalent combination of full-time and part-time
employees,
...will be required to provide healthcare for
their employees and their dependents.
The following is from a recent
New York Times article
Under the rules, employers must offer
coverage to employees in 2014 and must offer coverage to dependents as
well, starting in 2015.
The new rules apply to employers that have
at least 50 full-time employees or an equivalent combination of
full-time and part-time employees. A full-time employee is a person
employed on average at least 30 hours a week. And 100 half-time
employees are considered equivalent to 50 full-time employees.
Thus, the government said, an employer will
be subject to the new requirement if it has 40 full-time employees
working 30 hours a week and 20 half-time employees working 15 hours a
week.
So conceivably an employer could have only
part-time employees and still be required to provide healthcare coverage
under Obamacare.
Of course many small businesses will not be able
to afford to do this, so expect to see a significant number of them shut
down or to try to survive with skeleton crews in 2014 and 2015.
As the number of laws, rules and regulations
that govern our lives continues to multiply, the control freaks that run
things will continue to try to use technology to watch us all and
make sure that we are obeying their rules.
One way that they are doing this is with
automated traffic cameras. Of course much of the time the performance of
these cameras is terribly flawed.
Just consider the following example which
recently appeared in the
Baltimore Sun
The Baltimore City speed camera ticket
alleged that the four-door Mazda wagon was going 38 miles per hour in a
25-mph zone - and that owner Daniel Doty owed $40 for the infraction.
But the Mazda wasnt speeding. It wasnt
even moving.
The two photos printed on the citation as
evidence of speeding show the car was idling at a red light with its
brake lights illuminated. A three-second video clip also offered as
evidence shows the car motionless, as traffic flows by on a cross
street.
But even though technology sometimes fails, the
control freaks that run things seem absolutely obsessed with using it to
monitor us. After all, there are so many of us and watching all of us is a
very big job.
For example, did you know that listening devices
are being installed on public buses all over the United States?
The following is from a
recent Wired article
Transit authorities in cities across the
country are quietly installing microphone-enabled surveillance systems
on public buses that would give them the ability to record and store
private conversations, according to documents obtained by a news outlet.
The systems are being installed in San
Francisco, Baltimore, and other cities with funding from the Department
of Homeland Security in some cases,
according to the Daily, which obtained copies of contracts,
procurement requests, specs and other documents.
According to the article, some of these systems
are incredibly advanced and pair the audio that is being recorded with video
that is being taken at the same time
In Eugene, Oregon, the Daily found, transit
officials requested microphones that would be capable of distilling
clear conversations from the background noise of other voices, wind,
traffic, windshields wipers and engines and also wanted at least five
audio channels spread across each bus that would be paired with one or
more camera images and recorded synchronously with the video for
simultaneous playback.
But that is just one example of how the
surveillance of the American people is rapidly growing.
For many more examples, please see my previous
article entitled 29
Signs That The Elite Are Transforming Society Into A Total Domination
Control Grid.
If America continues down the path that it is on
right now, the United States will eventually be transformed into a Big
Brother society that is far more restrictive than anything
George Orwell ever dreamed of.
-
We need a fundamental cultural
revolution in this nation
-
We need a revival of the principals of
liberty and freedom that were so important during the founding days
of this country
-
We need to teach people that even though
liberty and freedom may be unpredictable at times, such an
environment is greatly preferable to a society where all of our
decisions are made for us by a tiny elite
Please share this article with as many people as
you can.
Time is running out, and we need to wake up as
many as we can while there is still time.
