"Over 850 Billion Records
about Phone Calls, Emails, Cellphone
Locations,
and Internet Chats"
The
Intercept was already getting the intelligence community excited with
its revelations that the National Security Agency had decided to
mimic inspector Google.
Through creating a search engine in the manner
of those pro-transparency pioneers, the intelligence community was turning
the tables on the very idea of searchable information.
Why keep it the operating preserve of the
public?
The search engine has, as it stands, over 850
billion records about phone calls, emails, cellphone locations, and internet
chats.[1]
The revelations have a few implications, the most obvious one confirming the
seamless transition between intelligence work on the one hand, and the
policing function on the other. The distinction between intelligence
communities whose interests are targeting matters foreign to the polity, and
those who maintain order within the boundaries of a state in a protective
capacity, prove meaningless in this form.
The use of
ICREACH makes it clear that the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
are regular clients and users of the system.
A 2010 memorandum from the Chief of Liaison Support Group
at the CIA titled "CIA colleagues enthusiastically welcome NSA training"
[2] speaks with praise about those "NSA-ers embedded in CIA's
workspaces".
Indeed, it speaks very highly of the
"information sharing" ethos of the NSA within the Intelligence Community,
channeling Google's operating rationale within more secret spaces.
Furthermore, in 2010, the relevant data base
provided the NSA,
"and second Party telephony metadata events
to over 1000 analysts across 23 US Intelligence Community agencies."
Those keen on squirreling information into such
a data base are no doubt thrilled by the prospects that it can be made
available to the "appropriate" sources.
ICREACH has become one of the largest, if not
largest system for the internal processing and sharing of surveillance
records within the United States. It is not, according to The Intercept,
connected with the NSA database that stores data on Americans' phone calls
pursuant to s. 215 of the Patriot Act.
The difference between the two accumulated pools of data is one of scope:
-
ICREACH is mammoth in reach, and
positively defiant in its push against the law
-
the database gathered under s. 215
guidelines is minute in comparison, confined to the dangerously
pertinent idea of combating terrorism and like threats
ICREACH exists outside the system of court
orders, being a creature of
Executive Order 12333.
The document, instituted by President Ronald
Reagan in 1981, was intended to add robustness to the intelligence gathering
capabilities of the US intelligence community.
John Tye,[3]
formally of the US State Department, has wrestled with the way EO 12333 is
used.
He accepts its premise that it is primarily,
"to target foreigners abroad, and collection
happens outside the US."
However,
"My complaint is not that they're using it
to target Americans, my complaint is that the volume of incidental
collection on US persons is unconstitutional."
The idea of restraining intelligence gathering
to pertinent, specific targeting has gotten increasingly old fashioned in
the information banquet of the modern NSA community.
Farming modern metadata provides a diet
positively rich in carbohydrates, a deficient diet when it comes to
nutrition, but excessive when it comes to those fats a lean intelligence,
and policing service, should avoid.
The true fat stripping agent here is the law, with its targeted formulae
that keeps intelligence agencies focused and relevant in their activities.
The most humble analyst will use the law as a tool for gathering, and
analyzing good data. The slothful gatherer will prefer the short cuts,
including the magical search term that avoids as much as it captures. Bugger
the law and type in the search term.
The progenitor of this system was retired NSA director Gen. Keith
Alexander.
In a 2006 letter to John Negroponte, then
Director of National Intelligence, Alexander outlined his ideas of a search
tool that would,
To what end? Prizing open a "vast, rich source
of information".
Superbly dim in a sense - information is not
knowledge; and knowledge is not, on its own accord, information. The glaring
point here is that the higher ups in the intelligence community have gotten
the wrong end of the stick.
In 2007, ICREACH was launched, its purpose being to deliver,
"the first-ever wholesale sharing
communications database within the US Intelligence Community."
It became, as spokesman from the US Office of
the Director of National Intelligence Jeffrey Anchukaitis suggested,
part of a fundamental "pillar of the post-9/11 intelligence community" - the
principle of sharing information between.
Authorities, irrespective of legal distraction
or distinction, could obtain data that would otherwise be,
"stove-piped in any single office or
agency."
The problems of such data-sharing processes is
the mechanical presumption that they take place in a legal vacuum.
On the one hand, members of the intelligence
community are becoming the lounge lizards of bureaucracy. They hug metadata
the way a viewer of cable channel television surfs the package of channels.
Nothing is actually processed. What matters is having the package to begin
with.
The other consequence is dangerous - such sharing practices distribute
sensitive material of citizens, both American and non-American, in a manner
that mocks any legal restraint.
According to Brian Owsley, who presided
as federal magistrate judge between 2005 and 2013,
"there shouldn't be this buddy-buddy system
back-and-forth."
Time, it would seem, to burn the fat off the
obese operator that is the modern US intelligence community.
