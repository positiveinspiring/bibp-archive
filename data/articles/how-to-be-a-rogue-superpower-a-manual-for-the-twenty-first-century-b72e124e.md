It's hard even to know how to take it in. I
mean, what's really happening?
An employee of a private contractor working for
the National Security Agency (NSA) makes off with unknown numbers of
files about America's developing global
security state on a thumb
drive and four
laptop computers, and jumps the nearest plane to Hong Kong.
His goal: to expose a vast surveillance
structure built in the shadows in the post-9/11 years and significantly
aimed at Americans.
He leaks some of the documents to a columnist at
the British Guardian and
to the Washington
Post.
The response is unprecedented:
an "international
manhunt" (or more politely but less accurately, "a
diplomatic full court press") conducted not by Interpol or the
United Nations but by the planet's sole superpower, the very government
whose practices the leaker was so intent on exposing.
And that's just for starters. Let's add another
factor.
The leaker, a young man with great techno-savvy,
lets the world know that he's picked and chosen among the NSA files in his
possession. He's releasing only those he thinks the American public needs in
order to start a full-scale debate about the unprecedented secret world of
surveillance that their taxpayer dollars have created. In other words, this
is no "document dump."
He wants to spark change without
doing harm.
But here's the kicker: he couldn't
be more aware of previous whistleblower cases, the punitive reaction of
his government to them, and the fate that might be his. As a result, we now
know, he has encrypted the
full set of files in his possession and left them in one or more safe places
for unknown individuals - that is, we don't know who they are - to access,
should he be taken by the U.S.
In other words, from the time
Edward Snowden's first leaked documents
came out, it was obvious that he was in control of how much of
the NSA's
secret world would be seen.
It would be hard then not to conclude that
capturing him, imprisoning him, trying him, and throwing away the key is
likely to increase,
not decrease, the flow of those documents.
Knowing that, the
Obama
administration and the representatives of our secret world went
after him anyway - after one man on a global scale and in a way that may not
have a precedent.
No thought of future embarrassment stopped them,
nor, it seems, did they hesitate because of possible resentments engendered
by their heavy-handed pressure on numerous foreign governments.
The result has been a global spectacle, as well
as a worldwide debate about the spying practices of the U.S. (and its allies).
In these weeks, Washington has proven
determined, vengeful, implacable. It has strong-armed, threatened, and
elbowed powers large and small. It has essentially pledged that the leaker,
former Booz Allen employee Edward Snowden, will never be safe on this planet
in his lifetime.
And yet, to mention the obvious, the greatest
power on Earth has, as yet, failed to get its man and is losing the public
opinion battle globally.
An Asylum-less World
Highlighted in all this has been a curious fact
of our twenty-first-century world.
In the Cold War years, asylum was always
potentially available. If you opposed one of the two superpowers or its
allies, the other was usually ready to open its arms to you, as the U.S.
famously did for what were once called "Soviet dissidents" in great numbers.
The Soviets did the same for Americans, Brits,
and others, often secret communists, sometimes actual spies, who opposed the
leading capitalist power and its global order.
Today, if you are a
twenty-first-century "dissident"
and need asylum/protection from the only superpower left, there is
essentially none to be had. Even after
three Latin American countries, enraged at Washington's
actions, extended offers of protection to Snowden, these should be
treated as a new category of limited asylum.
After all, the greatest power on the planet has,
since 9/11, shown itself perfectly willing to do almost anything in pursuit
of its definition of "security" or the security of its security system.
Torture,
abuse,
the setting up of secret prisons or "black
sites," the
kidnapping
of terrorist suspects (including
perfectly
innocent people) off the streets of global cities and in the backlands
of the planet, as well as their "rendition" to the torture chambers of
complicit allied regimes, and the secret surveillance of anyone anywhere
would only start a far longer list.
Nothing about the "international manhunt" for
Snowden indicates that the Obama administration would be unwilling to send
in the CIA or special operations types to "render" him from Venezuela,
Bolivia, or Nicaragua, no matter the cost to hemispheric relations.
Snowden himself brought up this possibility in
his first interview with Guardian columnist Glenn Greenwald.
"I could,"
he said bluntly, "be rendered by the CIA."
This assumes that he can even make it to a land
of exile from somewhere in the bowels of the international terminal of
Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport without being intercepted by Washington.
It's true that there remain some modest limits
on the actions even of a rogue superpower. It's hard to imagine Washington
dropping its kidnappers into Russia or China to take Snowden, which is
perhaps why it has put such pressure on both countries to turn him in or
hustle him along.
With smaller, weaker lands, however, non-nuclear
allies or enemies or frenemies, don't doubt the possibility for a second.
If Edward Snowden is proving one thing, it's
this:
in 2013, Planet Earth isn't big enough to
protect the American version of "dissidents."
Instead, it looks ever more like a giant
prison with a single implacable policeman, judge, jury, and jailer.
Deterrence Theory the
Second Time Around
In the Cold War years, the two nuclear-armed
superpowers practiced what was called "deterrence theory," or more aptly
MAD, short for "mutually assured destruction."
Think of it as the particularly grim underside
of what might have been but wasn't called MAA (mutually assured asylum).
The
knowledge that no nuclear first strike by one superpower could succeed in
preventing the other from striking back with overwhelming force, destroying
them both (and possibly the planet) seemed,
however barely, to hold their enmity and weaponry at bay. It forced them
to fight their wars, often by proxy, on the global frontiers of empire.
Now, with but one superpower left, another kind
of deterrence theory has come into play.
Crucial to our era is the ongoing creation of
the first global surveillance state. In the Obama years, the sole superpower
has put special effort into deterring anyone in its
labyrinthine bureaucracy who shows a desire to let us know what "our"
government is doing in our name.
The Obama administration's efforts to stop
whistleblowers are becoming legendary. It has launched an
unprecedented program to specially train millions of employees and
contractors to profile coworkers for "indicators of insider threat
behavior."
They are being encouraged to inform on any
"high-risk persons" they suspect might be planning to go public.
Administration officials have also put
much
punitive energy into making examples out of whistleblowers who have
tried to reveal anything of the inner workings of the national security
complex.
In this way, the Obama administration has
more than doubled the total whistleblower prosecutions of all previous
administrations combined under the draconian World War I-era Espionage Act.
It has also gone after Army Private
Bradley Manning for releasing secret
military and State Department
files
to WikiLeaks, not only attempting to put him away for life for "aiding
the enemy," but subjecting him to particularly vindictive and
abusive treatment while in military prison.
In addition, it has
threatened
journalists who have written on or published leaked material and gone on
expeditions into the
telephone and
email
records
of major media organizations.
All of this adds up to a new version of
deterrence thinking in which a potential whistleblower should know that he
or she will experience a lifetime of suffering for leaking anything; in
which those, even
in the highest reaches of government, who consider speaking to
journalists on classified subjects should know that their calls could be
monitored and their whispers criminalized; and in which the media should
know that reporting on such subjects is not a healthy activity.
This sort of deterrence already seemed
increasingly extreme in nature; the response to Snowden's revelations took
it to a new level.
Though the U.S. government
pursued WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange abroad (while reportedly
preparing to indict him at home), the other whistleblower cases might
all be considered national security ones. The manhunt against
Snowden is something new.
Through it, Washington is now punitively
expanding twenty-first century deterrence theory to the world.
The message is this: nowhere will you be safe
from us if you breach U.S. secrecy. Snowden's will surely be a case study in
how far the new global security state is willing to go.
And the answer is already in: far indeed.
We just don't yet know exactly how far.
How to Down a Plane to
(Not) Catch a Whistleblower
In this light, no incident has been more
revealing than the
downing of the plane of Bolivian President Evo Morales, the
democratically elected head of a sovereign Latin American nation, and not an
official enemy of the United States.
Angry Bolivian authorities termed it a "kidnapping"
or "imperialist
hijack." It was, at the least, an act for which it's hard to imagine a
precedent.
Evidently officials in Washington believed that
the plane bringing the Bolivian president back from Moscow was also carrying
Snowden.
As a result, the U.S. seems to have put enough pressure on four
European countries,
-
France
-
Spain
-
Portugal
-
Italy,
... to force that plane to land for refueling in
a fifth country (Austria).
There - again, U.S. pressure
seems to have been the crucial factor - it was searched under
disputed circumstances and Snowden not found.
So much is not known about what happened, in
part because there has been no serious reporting from Washington on the
subject. The U.S. media has largely ignored the American role in the downing
of the plane, an incident regularly described here as if the obvious hadn't
happened.
This may, at least in part, be the result of the
Obama administration's implacable pursuit of whistleblowers and leakers
right into the phone records of reporters. The government has made such a
point of its willingness to pursue whistleblowers via journalists that, as
Associated Press President Gary Pruitt recently
pointed out, national security sources are drying up. Key figures in
Washington are scared to talk even off the record (now that "off" turns out
to be potentially very "on").
And the Justice Department's new
"tighter"
guidelines for accessing reporters' records are clearly filled
with loopholes and undoubtedly little more than window dressing.
Still, it's reasonable to imagine that when
Morales's plane took off from Moscow there were top U.S. officials gathered
in a situation room (à la the bin Laden affair), that the president
was in the loop, and that the intelligence people said something like: we
have an 85% certainty that Snowden is on that plane.
Obviously, the decision was made to bring it
down and enough pressure was placed on key officials in those five countries
to cause them to bow to Washington's will.
One can certainly imagine that, but know it? At
the moment, not a chance and, unlike in the raid that killed bin Laden, a
triumphant situation-room photo hasn't been released, since there was,
of course, no triumph.
Many questions arise.
Why, to mention just one, did Washington not
allow Morales's plane to land for
refueling in Portugal, as originally planned, and simply strong-arm the
Portuguese into searching it? As with so much else, we don't know.
We only know that, to bring five countries into
line that way, the pressure from Washington (or its local representatives)
must have been intense.
Put another way: key officials in those
countries must have realized quickly that they stood in the way of a truly
powerful urge by the planet's superpower to get one fugitive.
It was an urge so strong that it overrode any
other tactical considerations, and so opened the way for Venezuela, Bolivia,
and Nicaragua to offer asylum to Snowden with the
support of much of the rest of Latin America.
-
Imagine for a moment that an American
president's plane had been brought down in a similar fashion
-
Imagine that a consortium of nations
pressured by, say, China or Russia, did it and that, with the
president aboard, it was then searched for a Chinese or Soviet
"dissident"
-
Imagine the reaction here
-
Imagine the shock
-
Imagine the accusations of
"illegality,"
of "skyjacking," of "international terrorism"
-
Imagine the 24/7 media coverage
-
Imagine the information pouring out of
Washington about what would no doubt have been termed "an act of
war"
Of course, such a scenario is inconceivable on
this one-way planet.
So instead, just think about the silence here
over the Morales incident, the lack of coverage, the lack of reporting, the
lack of outrage, the lack of shock, the lack of... well, just about anything
at all.
Instead, the twenty-first-century version of
deterrence theory ruled the day, even though Snowden is the proof that
deterrence via manhunts, prosecution, imprisonment, and the like has proven
ineffective when it comes to leaks.
It's worth pointing out that what may be the two
largest leaks of official documents in history - Bradley Manning's and
Snowden's - happened in a country increasingly under the sway of deterrence
theory.
Slouching Toward
Washington to Be Born
And yet don't think that no one has been
affected, no one intimidated.
Consider, for instance, a superior piece of
recent reporting by Eric Lichtblau of the New York Times.
His front-page story, "In
Secret, Court Vastly Broadens Powers of NSA," might once have sent shock
waves through Washington and perhaps the country as well.
It did, after all, reveal how, in,
"more than a dozen classified rulings," a
secret FISA court, which oversees the American surveillance state, "has
created a secret body of law" giving the NSA sweeping new powers.
Here's the paragraph that should have had
Americans jumping out of their skins:
"The 11-member Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court, known as the FISA court, was once mostly focused on
approving case-by-case wiretapping orders.
But since major changes in legislation and
greater judicial oversight of intelligence operations were instituted
six years ago, it has quietly become almost a parallel Supreme Court,
serving as the ultimate arbiter on surveillance issues and delivering
opinions that will most likely shape intelligence practices for years to
come, the officials said."
At most moments in American history, the
revelation that such a secret court, which
never turns down government requests, is making law "almost" at the
level of the Supreme Court would surely have caused an outcry in Congress
and elsewhere.
However, there was none, a sign either of how
powerful and intimidating the secret world has become or of how much
Congress and the rest of Washington have already been absorbed into it.
No less strikingly - and again, we know so
little that it's necessary to read between the lines - Lichtblau indicates
that more than six "current and former national security officials," perhaps
disturbed by the expanding powers of the FISA court, discussed its
classified rulings "on the condition of anonymity."
Assumedly, at least one of them (or someone
else) leaked the classified information about that court to him.
Fittingly enough, Lichtblau wrote a remarkably
anonymous piece. Given that sources no longer have any assurance that phone
and email records aren't being or won't be monitored, we have no idea how
these shadowy figures got in touch with him or vice versa.
All we know is that, even when shining a
powerful light into the darkness of the surveillance universe, American
journalism now finds itself plunging into the shadows as well.
What both the Morales incident and the Lichtblau
article tell us, and what we've barely taken in, is how our American world
is changing. In the Cold War years, faced with a MAD world, both superpowers
ventured "into the shadows" to duke it out in their global struggle.
As in so many wars, sooner or later the methods
used in distant lands came home to haunt us.
In the twenty-first century, without another
major power in sight, the remaining superpower has made those "shadows" its
own in a big way. Just beyond the view of the rest of us, it began
recreating its famed tripartite, checks-and-balances government, now more
than two centuries old, in a new form.
There, in those shadows, the executive,
judicial, and legislative branches began to meld into a unicameral shadow
government, part of a new architecture of control that has nothing to do
with "of the people, by the people, for the people."
Such a shadow government placing its trust in
secret courts and the large-scale surveillance of populations, its own
included, while pursuing its secret desires globally was just the sort of
thing that the country's founding fathers feared.
In the end, it hardly
matters under what label - including American "safety" and "security" - such
a governing power is built; sooner or later, the architecture will determine
the acts, and it will become more tyrannical at home and more extreme
abroad.
Welcome to the world of the single rogue
superpower, and thank your lucky stars that Edward Snowden made the choices
he did. It's eerie that some aspects of the totalitarian governments that
went down for the count in the twentieth century are now being recreated in
those shadows.
There, an increasingly "totalistic" if not yet
totalitarian beast, its hour come round at last, is slouching toward
Washington to be born, while those who cared to shine a little light on the
birth process are in jail or being hounded across this planet.
We have now experienced deterrence theory in two
centuries.
Once it was brought to bear to stop the
wholesale destruction of the planet; once - and they do
say that if the first time is tragedy, the second is farce - to deter a
small number of whistleblowers from revealing the innards of our new
global security state.
We came close enough to total tragedy once.
If only we could be assured that the second time
around it would indeed be total farce, but at the moment, as far as I can
tell, no one's laughing.
