A top-secret
NSA presentation reveals how the agency
used Facebook to hack into
targeted computers for surveillance.
On Wednesday, Glenn Greenwald and I
revealed new details about the National
Security Agency's efforts to radically expand its ability to hack into
computers and networks across the world.
The story has received a lot of attention, and
one detail in particular has sparked controversy:
specifically, that the NSA secretly
pretended to be a Facebook server in order to covertly infect targets
with
malware "implants" used for surveillance.
This revelation apparently infuriated Facebook
founder Mark Zuckerberg so much that he
got on the phone to President Barack Obama to complain about it.
"I've been so confused and frustrated by the
repeated reports of the behavior of the US government," Zuckerberg wrote
in
a
blog post Thursday.
"When our engineers work tirelessly to
improve security, we imagine we're protecting you against criminals, not
our own government."
That wasn't all.
Wired
ran a piece
saying that the NSA's widespread use of its malware tools,
"acts as implicit permission to others, both
nation-state and criminal."
Slate
noted that the NSA's hacking platform appears to be,
"becoming a bit more like the un-targeted
dragnets everyone has been so upset about."
Meanwhile, Ars Technica
wrote that the surveillance technology we exposed "poses a risk to the
entire Internet."
In response, the NSA has attempted to quell the
backlash by putting out a
public
statement dismissing what it called "inaccurate" media reports.
The agency denied that it was,
"impersonating U.S. social media or other
websites" and said that it had not "infected millions of computers
around the world with malware."
The statement follows a trend that has
repeatedly
been
seen in the aftermath of major disclosures from documents turned over by
NSA whistleblower
Edward Snowden, in which the NSA or one of its implicated
allies issues a carefully worded non-denial denial that on the face of it
seems to refute an allegation but on closer inspection does not refute it at
all.
Prior to publishing our story, we asked the NSA
to explain its use of Facebook to deploy malware as part of a top-secret
initiative codenamed
QUANTUMHAND.
The NSA declined to answer all of our questions
or offer context for the documents. We went into meticulous detail in our
report, which went through a rigorous fact-checking process because of the
gravity of the revelations.
What we reported, accurately, was that the
Snowden files showed how the agency had in some cases,
"masqueraded as a fake Facebook server,
using the social media site as a launching pad to infect a target's
computer and exfiltrate files from a hard drive."
The source for that detail was not plucked from
thin air; it was rooted in multiple
documents that refer to the technique in action, including the
internal NSA animation that we
published.
A particular short excerpt from one of the
classified documents, however, has taken on new significance due to the
NSA's statement. The excerpt is worth drawing attention to here because of
the clarity of the language it uses about the Facebook tactic and the light
it shines on the NSA's denial.
Referencing the NSA's Quantum malware
initiative, the document, dated April 2011, explains how the NSA "pretends"
to be Facebook servers to deploy its surveillance "implants" on target's
computers:
It is difficult to square the NSA secretly
saying that it,
"pretends to be the Facebook server" while
publicly claiming that it "does not use its technical capabilities to
impersonate U.S. company websites."

-
Is the agency making a devious and
unstated distinction in its denial between "websites" and "servers"?
-
Was it deliberate that the agency used
the present tense "does not" in its denial as opposed to the past
tense "did not"?
-
Has the Facebook QUANTUMHAND technique
been shut down since our report?
Either way, the language used in the NSA's
public statement seems highly misleading - which is why
several
tech
writers have rightly treated it with skepticism.
The same is true of the NSA's denial that it has
not "infected millions of computers around the world with malware" as part
of its hacking efforts. Our report never actually accused the NSA of
having achieved that milestone.
Again, we reported exactly what the NSA's own
documents say:
that the NSA is working to "aggressively scale"
its computer hacking missions and has built a system called TURBINE that it
explicitly states will, "allow the current implant network to scale
to large size (millions of implants)."
Only a decade ago, the number of implants
deployed by the NSA was in the hundreds, according to the Snowden files.
But the agency now reportedly manages a network
of between
85,000 and
100,000 implants in computers systems
worldwide - and, if TURBINE's capabilities and the NSA's own documents
are anything to go by, it is intent on substantially increasing those
numbers.
The rapid proliferation of these hacking
techniques in the past decade, under cover of intense secrecy, is
extraordinary and unprecedented. The NSA insists in its denial that its
hacking efforts are not "indiscriminate."
Yet how the agency defines "indiscriminate" in
this context remains unclear.
The Intercept asked the NSA to clarify
some of these issues for this post.
-
Does the agency deny that it has used
the QUANTUMHAND method to pretend to be a Facebook server
in order to deploy malware implants?
-
How does the NSA distinguish
"indiscriminate" from "discriminate"?
-
In what specific legal, policy, and
operational context does the implants system function?
The agency declined to answer all of these
questions.
Instead, spokeswoman Vanee' Vines said that the NSA stood by its original statement, adding only that,
"unauthorized and
selective publication" of the documents "may lead to incorrect assumptions."
The NSA's outgoing chief has
claimed that the agency supports increased transparency in the wake of
the Snowden leaks - but its response to the latest disclosures illustrates
that it is failing to live up to that commitment.
If the NSA truly wants to
gain citizens' trust, it should rethink its slippery public relations
strategy.
A good first step would be to stop issuing
dubious denials that seem to sit so starkly at odds with what its officials
were saying in secret when they thought nobody would ever learn about what
they were doing.
