Question: A question from J.D. in New York:
"Which religion,
philosophy, esoteric school's 'story' concerning the nature of life
on Earth, spiritual progress, deity, life after death, man's place
in creation, etc., is the nearest to the actual facts?"
A:
This Awareness indicates that this question is not clear. It is not
clear to what the term "religion" means or what the term
"philosophy" means. This Awareness could answer the question easily
by saying that the philosophy which is more closely associated with
the actual facts is the philosophy which this Awareness has given.
However, this Awareness does not consider itself as a religion or
its message as a religion, therefore, the entity may not likewise
consider this as a religion, and is more likely asking about the
traditional orthodox religions.
This Awareness indicates that if the entity is speaking of the more
orthodox religions, then this Awareness would say that the Hindu
philosophy is the more closely related in actuality in the sense of
its basic cosmology regarding the paths to spiritual enlightenment,
regarding the planes and the vibratory rates between dimension.
However, there is also another level of truth found in the Buddhist
philosophy, and still another truth found in the Christian
philosophy. The Jewish philosophy also carries a great truth. All of
these have certain elements and all have certain areas that are
somewhat lacking in terms of clarity in regard to actual truth of
reality.
This Awareness has discussed many of these things already.
This
Awareness indicates the concept of the Buddha as representing
certain truths in the sense of realizing that when the Buddha
reached enlightenment, he discovered that all others were also Buddhas and that they were all gods and deities, even if they had
forgotten or failed to realize their Buddhahood.
This Awareness indicates the same in regard to Christianity. There
are certain truths there which must be understood for entities to
have a complete recognition of reality in that the Christ being one
with God is a message for entities all to recognize; that when one
is Christed as a divine being, the entity becomes one with God.
In other words, surrendering self to God, one becomes
Christed or
anointed with the frequency and vibration associated with the Divine
Creator. This Awareness indicates there are many distortions that
entities have brought to the Christian religion, but when it is
properly understood, there are many great truths within the
Christian religion.
This Awareness indicates also the same can be said for the Hebrew
version of the Divine Creator and its place in the universe. All of
these religions have something to offer. This Awareness suggests
that entities learn something of the basics of all religions and
they will find themselves accepting a composite of all religions in
such a way that they are more complete and more wholesome in their
spiritual evolution.
This Awareness indicates that religions that call for human
sacrifice, religions that call for the slaying of your enemy or
which condone the slaying of your enemy, or the harm perpetrated
against non-believers - these religions are in error insofar as
they promote conflict of one religion over another.
This Awareness indicates that this does not mean that there are no
redeeming factors within those religions, there may be many factors
in the religions that make them healthy, while there may be also
many factors that make them unhealthy for human consumption.
This Awareness suggests that entities, in learning what is truly
spiritual and divine, can separate the spiritual and divine of a
religion from that which is less than wholesome so that they can
look at their own religion, or the religion of others, and recognize
what is good and what is in error in that religion, for none is
absolutely truthful in the highest sense, and none is false in the
total sense.
All have something of value, all have something that should be
improved upon. This Awareness indicates of those philosophies
connected with India, that which is called the path of Sant Mat
appears to be one of the purest of the long line of religions that
embraces the teachings of the saints, stemming from prior to the
time of Christ, up to the present, being pure in the sense that it
is not distorted by commercialism.
The Christian religion has been
highly commercialized in order to promote it to greater numbers and
to the mass consumption. This Awareness indicates that it still
retains a certain amount of purity.
The Sant Mat path appears to be that which had an origin of a same
or similar source as Christianity. In fact, much of Christianity
embraces some of the Sant Mat teachings and principles from ancient
times, but the Sant Mat path remained pure and in terms of this type
of religion, can be said to be the most pure to its original source,
however, this does not mean it is based on or comes from the
absolute truth.
There are concepts involved in the Sant Mat teachings which embrace
spiritual truths, yet there are also spiritual truths that have not
been examined or understood by the Sant Mat teachings, the same as
there are truths that have not been properly understood by the
Christian religion, even in its early era.
This Awareness indicates that the
Huna philosophy of Hawaii was
liberated by exploration of the Hawaiian language, especially
through works of Max Freedom Long, and this released an
understanding of a kind of Huna "code" found in all religions of the
ancient sources, and this Huna code explains a philosophical outlook
upon which many of the religions from the past were based and from
which many religions evolved.
This Awareness indicates that this, in one sense, is the most pure
form of studying the mother religion, if entities wish to do so.
This Awareness indicates that the book "The Huna Code in Religions"
by Max Freedom Long can give a good foundation for further
exploration and study of this mother of all religions.
You will see
your religion, you will see the Christian religion, you will see
some of the Oriental and Middle Eastern religions in the coded
symbols of the Huna philosophy as revealed by the language breakdown
and codes in the Hawaiian language.
This Awareness indicates that even this mother religion is not a
complete understanding or a complete representation of truth. There
are still more truths which may not have been discovered at the time
these religions were encoded in the Hawaiian language.
This
Awareness indicates it is therefore important that entities not
settle on just the study of one religion alone, but that they
recognize there are many different truths that can be extracted from
the study of different religions, different philosophies.
