Of his films as a whole, John Stauber,
the founder of the Center for Media and Democracy, stated:
Metanoia is brilliantly pioneering the new
film-making - incisive analysis, compelling sound and footage, fearless
and independent reporting, and the aggregation of the best information
out there into powerful, educational and free online feature films - all
on a shoestring budget.
Nobles films are dedicated to democracy;
they fan the flames of non-violent, people-powered revolution.

James Bamford - Inside the NSA's Largest Secret Domestic Spy Center

A new exposé in Wired Magazine reveals details about how the National
Security Agency is quietly building the largest spy center in the country in Bluffdale, Utah, as part of a secret NSA surveillance program code-named
"Stellar Wind."
We speak with investigative reporter James Bamford who says
the NSA has established listening posts throughout the nation to collect and
sift through billions of email messages and phone calls, whether they
originate within the country or overseas.
The
Utah spy center will contain
near-bottomless databases to store all forms of communication collected by
the agency.
This includes the complete contents of private emails, cell
phone calls and Google searches, as well as all sorts of personal data
trails - parking receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases and other
digital "pocket litter."
