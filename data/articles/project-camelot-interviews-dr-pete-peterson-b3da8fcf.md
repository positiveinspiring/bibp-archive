1 September 2009 Pete Peterson: Update We seem to have hit a snag in getting Pete to approve the video interview we did with him now nearly two months ago. Apparently the PTB [Powers-that-be] are not entirely happy with the interview and we are still awaiting Pete's approval.
We apologize for the delay. It is testimony to what an un-free society we live in that this interview would cause the PTB to step in. Wonder what it contains that has them so worried...
If you choose to think about this, it appears they may be in quite a bind. If they delay it any further then we will have to assume it contains some really important revealing testimony.
2 September 2009 From: Dr Pete Peterson Date: Weds, 2 Sept 2009 09:56 AM To: Bill Ryan and Kerry Cassidy Subject: Re: RELEASE OF YOUR VIDEO INTERVIEW Kerry and all!!
If you only knew just what was happening in the world and all I am trying to prepare for and to prevent. Everyone is working 24/7 to do the same. Those I've needed to get approval from have been sleepless for weeks and are not very responsive. I've told them that I must have input by Friday or off it all goes. Sorry about what is happening to our world, or maybe not. Hopefully we'll all see each other soon. Pete Peterson
From: Bill Ryan and Kerry Cassidy Sent: Weds, 2 Sept, 2009 10:01 AM To: Dr Pete Peterson Subject: Re: RELEASE OF YOUR VIDEO INTERVIEW Hi there, Pete - a big bear hug to you there! Thank you so much for this. Were getting a lot of flak (as you can imagine) for promising something important, timely and relevant... and then (seemingly) failing to deliver. May we therefore release this on Friday if we do not hear to the contrary? Very much looking forward to seeing you in LA in a couple of weeks time. Very best wishes as always.
Bill
From: Date: Weds, 2 Sept 2009 10:23 AM To: Bill Ryan and Kerry Cassidy, Dr Pete Peterson Subject: RE: RELEASE OF YOUR VIDEO INTERVIEW Pete, your email is extremely fascinating in light of the very, very intense dream messages Ive been getting, which is about to go into a big post on my website. The only other time I had messages coming in this strongly before an event was prior to 9/11, but this time it doesnt appear that its a disaster as much as a very substantial change. In the video you may remember that you were very careful not to release anything you didnt want released. The only suggestions I had made to Bill and Kerry at the time were to delete the portions of the video where you were asked questions you did not want to answer, since some of them were leading questions. Our conversations were some of the most fascinating Ive ever had and I would love to do it again some time. There are many ways in which our knowledge complements each other nicely.
From: Bill Ryan and Kerry Cassidy Date: Weds, 2 Sept 2009 11:56 AM To: Dr Pete Peterson Subject: Re: RELEASE OF YOUR VIDEO INTERVIEW Pete - very good to catch up with you just now. We got bounced out of Skype (which is how we were calling you) and then could not reconnect. That sometimes happens - not necessarily anything malicious. Take care and get some sleep - well release the video on Friday if we dont hear from you before then. All best wishes
3 September 2009 On Whistleblowers: And yes, we are planning to release the Pete Peterson interview Friday (the next). One thing everyone needs to understand is that this whistleblower, and a few others, are still working for the PTB (Powers-that-be, for those who need the translation). How can a whistleblower still be working for the Man?
Easy, they are playing both sides... Their hearts are in the right place. Their reasons are complex. They may for instance be working for the good guys (or white hats) within the Matrix... They may be thinking that the dark side is losing and they are planning to defect or they may believe in a cause such as National Defense... It's not all black and white.
Think of it this way: if you work for a company, any company, you see its flaws but you need the paycheck or you support what their overall mission is... yet you may hate what they do to obtain the upper hand in the game (such as lie, kill and maim). Like it or not, a whistleblower from within the Matrix is in many ways treading a tightrope. They want to stay alive but they want to warn you, enlighten you or even save you... It's a matter of degree as to how far they can go before they reap consequences they may regret. On the outside, our situation isn't much different. We get the truth out there and risk whatever blowback may come.
In the end you lay your bets and you take your chances. Kerry
When we were introduced to Dr. Pete Peterson by a mutual friend, and spoke with him for the first time on the phone, we immediately realized we were talking with someone who even by Project Camelot standards had a quite enormous amount of high quality information, backed by personal experience, on an astonishingly large range of subjects. We told our friend David Wilcock. David felt very strongly - as a psychic intuitive - that we needed to visit Dr. Peterson immediately while he was willing to give on-record testimony. So this interview straight away broke new ground: it was the first Camelot interview in which David joined the two of us for the interview.
A few days later, Bill flew to the US from Europe for the weekend especially for the meeting - which was held over two long days. We talked extensively off-record, and Dr. Peterson was extremely cautious about presenting some of his testimony on video. But we nevertheless recorded nearly four hours of testimony. Listen carefully to the questions and the answers - especially in Kerry's Part 3 (Part 1 was Bill and Part 2 was David) - and enjoy the very end of Part 2, just as that part of the interview fades. (This is our favorite section, and we have very purposely left it in.) Dr. Peterson is an extremely well-informed insider - and a most remarkable and brilliant scientist - who came forward to talk with us publicly because he feels the issues he cares deeply about, and knows about, are too important to keep silent about.
We salute his courage. Among the many things Dr. Peterson spoke about at length was,
his strong, informed belief that there will be a melt-down of the global economy - and US infrastructure - which may be almost upon us that Obama is planning to disclose the reality of ET contact by the end of the year that most, but not all, of the ET visitors are friendly
his strong, informed belief that there will be a melt-down of the global economy - and US infrastructure - which may be almost upon us
that Obama is planning to disclose the reality of ET contact by the end of the year
that most, but not all, of the ET visitors are friendly
There is much, much more.
Here is a very general list of the subjects we discussed:
The probable (in Dr Peterson's strong opinion) collapse of the economy, infrastructure, and law and order in the US The planned disclosure of the ET presence The Aurora (now retired from service and replaced by vehicles capable of superluminal travel) and the TR3B (the large flying triangle, which functions as an aircraft carrier) The "information field" and how the body, the mind, and DNA really function Healing modalities which work very rapidly and effectively Artificial intelligence and advanced robotics 'Rescuing' brilliant scientists out of the old USSR How Mir (the Russian Space Station) was so heavy that it could not have been assembled without 'help' from our 'friends' (or, to be exact, the Russians' friends) Time spent in the Vatican Library The existence of Sumerian high technology Quantum computing (off-camera, Dr Peterson held in his hand a cheap quantum chip, which he had assembled himself in his own laboratory, with the computing power of 10,000 PCs) The genius of James Clerk Maxwell, and why Einstein was wrong Why you should not spend too much time in front of your new Digital TV The reality of the US prison camps How President Obama was (in all probability) set up How he came to understand that 15% of the world's population (of all races) have ET ancestry that can be seen in their DNA - and are also resistant to mind control technologies

The Aurora (now retired from service and replaced by vehicles capable of superluminal travel) and the TR3B (the large flying triangle, which functions as an aircraft carrier)
The "information field" and how the body, the mind, and DNA really function
Healing modalities which work very rapidly and effectively
Artificial intelligence and advanced robotics
'Rescuing' brilliant scientists out of the old USSR
How Mir (the Russian Space Station) was so heavy that it could not have been assembled without 'help' from our 'friends' (or, to be exact, the Russians' friends)
Time spent in the Vatican Library
The existence of Sumerian high technology
Quantum computing (off-camera, Dr Peterson held in his hand a cheap quantum chip, which he had assembled himself in his own laboratory, with the computing power of 10,000 PCs)
The genius of James Clerk Maxwell, and why Einstein was wrong
Why you should not spend too much time in front of your new Digital TV
The reality of the US prison camps
How President Obama was (in all probability) set up
How he came to understand that 15% of the world's population (of all races) have ET ancestry that can be seen in their DNA - and are also resistant to mind control technologies
The release of this video was delayed because Dr Peterson was concerned that it might contain some material that was just too sensitive, and which might endanger us.
He spent some time checking with colleagues to ensure that we would be safe to release the material.
At the time of writing, he has not specified what these sensitive parts of the video are - though one might guess. We have taken the decision to take these risks upon our own shoulders and to release the interview in its entirety. It has not been cut. We hope that those who have been waiting this for what feels (to us also!) quite a long time may understand the complexities and many factors involved, and that being a whistleblower is far from a simple matter.
Dr Peterson is a person of high integrity who is very concerned about some of the problems faced by the human race, and who to his immense credit feels that he must give a warning.
Besides the warning, as you will see, he offers a substantial smorgasbord of fascinating information on a very broad range of subjects.
