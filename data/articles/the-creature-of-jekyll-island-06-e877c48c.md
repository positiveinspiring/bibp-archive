Section VI
TIME TRAVEL INTO THE FUTURE
In the previous sections of this book, we have travelled through time. We
began our journey by stepping into the past. As we crisscrossed the
centuries, we observed wars, treachery, profiteering, and political
deception.
That has brought us to the present. Now we are prepared to ride
our time machine into the future. It will be a hair-raising trip, and much
of what lies ahead will be unpleasant. But it has not yet come to pass. It
is merely the projection of present forces.
If we do not like what we see,
we still have an opportunity to change those forces. The future will be what
we choose to make it.

DOOMSDAY MECHANISMS
The decline of American prosperity; the increase in the size of government;
the decrease in personal freedom; the growth of taxes; evidence that this is
according to plan by an elite riding group which hopes to merge the United
States into world government on the basis of "equality'' with less-developed
nations; the environmentalist movement shown to be an outgrowth of that
plan.
That's enough history for one book. It will soon be time to reset |the
coordinates on our time machine and jump into the future. Before activating
that switch, however, let's take one last look around us. The future is
molded by the present.
Where we are now will greatly affect where we are
going to be.
MIRED IN DEBT
One of the most obvious characteristics of our present time is the extent
to which Americans and their government have become 'mired in debt.
Annual
federal deficits have grown steadily since 1950, and the rate of growth is
now in a vertical climb. It had taken 198 years for the federal government
to borrow the first trillion {dollars. Then, in just twelve years - mostly
under the Reagan Administration - it borrowed another three trillion. By the
end of 1995, after three years of the Clinton Administration, the debt had
grown to about $5 trillion.
It is difficult to comprehend numbers of that size or to translate them into
their effect upon each of us. $5 trillion represents about 80% of all the
goods sold and all the services rendered in America throughout the entire
year. If you had a stack of $100 bills 40 inches high, you would be a
millionaire. $5 trillion would rise 3,350 miles into space.
By 1993, net interest payments on that debt were running $214 billion per
year. That consumed about 14% of all federal revenue. It now represents the
government's largest single expense; greater than defense; larger than the
combined cost of the departments of,
These charges are not paid by the government; they are paid by you.
You
provide the money through taxes and inflation. The cost currently is about
$4,500 for each family of four. All families pay through inflation but not
all pay taxes. The cost to each taxpaying family, therefore, is higher.
On
average, over $5,000 is extracted from your family each year, not to provide
government services or even to pay off previous debt. Nothing is produced by
it, not even roads or government buildings. No welfare or medical benefits
come out of it. No salaries are paid by it. The nation's standard of living
is not raised by it. It does nothing except pay interest.
Furthermore, the interest is compounded, which means, even if the government
were to completely stop its deficit spending, the total debt would continue
to grow as a result of interest on that portion which already exists. In
1995, interest on the national debt was already consuming 57% of all the
revenue collected by income taxes.
At the present rate of expansion, it will
consume 100% by the year 2010. That includes corporate taxes. Interest will
consume 100% of our personal income taxes much sooner.
Amazing isn't it? Without interest on the national debt, we would save
enough to reduce corporate taxes and eliminate personal income taxes
altogether.
Unfortunately, under present policies and programs, that is not
going to happen, because Congress does not live within its income. Many
expenses are paid, not from taxes, but from selling government bonds and
going deeper into debt each year. So, even though we could save enough to
eliminate personal income taxes, it would not be enough.
The government
would still go into the red to keep up its present life style.
However, if a
reduction in the size and scope of the bureaucracy were accomplished at the
same time, then personal find corporate income taxes could be entirely
eliminated, and the government would have an annual surplus.1
1- The federal government derives substantial revenue from sources other
than Income taxes, such as excise taxes and import taxes. These, plus
occasional assessments to the states, were the only taxes which the founding
fathers intended for the federal government. The arrangement worked well for
135 years until the income-fax was adopted in 1913.
THE DOOMSDAY MECHANISM
Unfortunately, the locomotive is running in the opposite direction.
The size
of government is growing larger, not smaller. There are more people working
for government than for all manufacturing companies in the private sector.
There are more bank regulators than bankers, more farm-bureau workers than
farmers, more welfare administrators than recipients. There are more
citizens receiving government checks than there are paying income taxes.
By 1996, welfare benefits in 29 states were higher than the average
secretary's wage; and in 6 states, they were more than the entry-level wage
for computer programmers. When it is possible [for people to vote on issues
involving the transfer of wealth to themselves from others, the ballot box
becomes a weapon with which the majority plunders the minority.
That is the
point of no return, the point where the doomsday mechanism begins to accelerates until the system self-destructs. The plundered grow weary of
carrying the load and eventually join the plunderers. The productive base of
the economy diminishes further and further until only the state remains.
The doomsday mechanism is also operating within government itself. By 1992,
more than half of all federal outlays went for what are called
entitlements. Those are expenses - such as Medicare, Social Security, and
government retirement programs - which are based on promises of future
payments. Many of them are contractual obligations, and millions of people
depend on them.
That does not mean they cannot be eliminated.
For example, Entitlements
include $24 billion per year for food stamps. There is fro contractual
obligation to continue those, only political expediency. By now, most
Americans have stood in grocery lines and
watched the well-dressed customer in front of them use food stamps for ice
cream, pretzels, candy, and wine and then drive away in a late-model car.
The political function of the food stamp program is not to help the hungry
but to buy votes.
The programs that do involve contractual obligations - such as Social
Security and Medicare - could be turned over to private firms which would
not only operate them more efficiently but also would pay out higher
benefits. Congress, however, does not dare to touch any of these
entitlements for fear of losing votes.
Normally, with contracts for future obligations of this kind, the issuer is
required by law to accumulate money into a fund to make sure that there will
be enough available when future payments become due. The federal government
does not abide by those laws. The funds exist on paper only. The money that
comes in for future obligations is immediately spent and replaced by a
government IOU. So, as those future payments come due, all of the money must
come from revenue being collected at that time.
Herein lies the doomsday mechanism. These obligations will be paid out of
future taxes or inflation. Entitlements currently represent 52% of all
federal outlays, and they are growing at the rate of 12% each year. When
this is added to the 14% that is now being spent for interest payments on
the national debt, we come to the startling conclusion that two-thirds of
all federal expenses are now entirely automatic, and that percentage is
growing each month.
Even if Congress were to stop all of the spending programs in the normal
budget - dismantle the armed forces, close down all of its agencies and
bureaus, stop all of its subsidies, and board up all of its buildings,
including the White House - it would be able to reduce its present spending
by only one-third. And even that small amount is shrinking by 10 to 12% per
year. That is a best-case scenario.
The real-case is that Congress is
accelerating its discretionary spending, not canceling it. One does not have
to be a statistical analyst to figure out where this trend is headed.
The biggest doomsday mechanism of all, however, is the Federal Reserve
System. It will be recalled that every cent of our money supply - including
coins, currency, and checkbook money - came into being for the purpose of
being loaned to someone. These dollars will disappear when those loans are
paid back. They exist only so long as the debt behind them exists.
Underneath the pyramid of money, supporting the entire structure, are the
so-called reserves which represent the Fed's monetization of Debt.
If we tried to pay off the national debt, those
reserves would also start to disappear, and our money supply would be undermined.
The Federal Reserve would have to scramble into
the money markets of the world and replace U.S. securities with bonds from corporations and other countries. Technically,
that can be done, but the transition could be devastating. Under the Federal
Reserve System, therefore, Congress would be fearful to eliminate the
national debt even if it wanted to.
These are the doomsday mechanisms already in operation. If we do not
understand how they function, we will not be prepared for our trip into the
future. The scenes that will unfold there will appear too bizarre, the
events too shocking.
We would be convinced that something surely had gone
wrong with our time machine.
WHO OWNS THE NATIONAL DEBT?
It has been said that we need not worry about interest on the national debt
because "We owe it to ourselves."
Let's take a look at who owes what to
whom.
It may come as a surprise to learn that the Federal Reserve holds but a
small portion of the national debt, only about 8%.
Foreign investors own
approximately 27%, and agencies of the federal government have 28% (the IOUs
that replaced money taken from the funds such as the Social Security Fund).
Private-sector Investors in the U.S. hold the largest share of about 37%. It
is partly [true, therefore, that "We owe it to ourselves" or at least that
all of us owe it to some of us.
The some of us who receive the interest are
private investors seeking income that is exempt from state income faxes, and
large institutions such as banks, corporations, insurance companies, and
investment funds. With institutions, the money represents pooled assets
belonging to thousands of small investors. So, a major portion of the
interest on the national debt does, indeed, accrue to the benefit of a large
sector of the American people.
That's the good news. The bad news is that the government obtains every
cent of the money it pays to us by confiscating it from us in the first
place. If it is true that we owe it to ourselves, then it is also true that
we pay it to ourselves. The money goes out of one pocket back into the other
- minus a handling fee. The government
takes $1000 from us in taxes and inflation and gives us back $350. The
so-called "benefit" to the public is but a giant scam.
And more bad news: When people purchase government bonds, there is less
money available for investment in private industry. It is well known that
government credit "crowds out" private credit.
The result is that the
productive side of the nation is handicapped by unfair competition for
investment capital. To obtain new money for growth, private companies must
pay higher interest rates. These are passed on to the consumer in the form
of higher prices.
Many companies are forced to curtail their plans for
expansion, and potentially new jobs are never created. Some companies are
forced out of business altogether, and their employees are put out of work.
The economy is always retarded by government debt.
The larger the debt, the
greater the damage.
The 27% portion of the national debt held by foreign investors may not seem
like a large percentage, but it represents a huge amount of money
nevertheless. A trillion dollars cannot be ignored. These bonds could become
a great problem down the line as they mature. So far, they have been a
partial blessing because they were purchased with money that already
existed.
Therefore, they were not inflationary. But it is not difficult to
imagine future conditions under which the bond holders would decide not to
renew. In order to pay off those bonds on maturity, the Treasury would have
to issue new ones. The Federal Reserve then would have to purchase the new
bonds with fiat money. Therefore, foreign-held federal debt is a ticking
time bomb.
If it should ever have to be picked up by the Fed, the
inflationary impact on our country would be staggering.
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
There is a tendency to read about these trends with a kind of detached
fascination.
-
Isn't that interesting?
-
But where is the relevance?
-
Why get
excited over such technicalities and abstractions?
-
So what if the government
is mired in debt? Who cares if the interest will never be paid?
-
What of it
if we have a world currency or a world government?
-
What difference will any
of it make to me?
The first step toward answering those questions is to see what difference it
already has made.
Our upcoming trip into the future will merely extend those
lines.
As illustrated in previous sections of this book, there has been a long-term
policy at the highest levels of government to shift economic resources away
from the United States. That policy has peen successful. Based on doomsday
predictions of environmental disaster, government has saddled private
companies with such burdensome expenses for eliminating waste products that
heavy industry, once the mainstay of American prosperity, has fled our shores.
Because of concern over the natural habitat of the spotted fowl and
the desert kangaroo rat, millions of acres of timber and Agricultural land
have been taken out of production. High taxes, rules beyond reason for
safety devices in the work place, so-called lair-employment practices, and
mandatory health insurance are Rapidly destroying what is left of America's
private industry. The Jesuit is unemployment and dislocation for millions of
American workers.
Federal taxes, including social-security, now take more than 40% of our
private incomes. State, county, and local taxes are on top [of that.
Inflation feeds on what is left. We spend half of each year working for the
government.
A study by the AFL-CIO in 1977 revealed that, in spite of wage Increases in
terms of dollars, the real wages of the average American - in terms of what
he can buy with those dollars - were going down. That trend was confirmed in
1980 by the U.S. Census Bureau. In 1992, the Consumers' Union analyzed how
many hours one had to work to buy common items compared to thirty years
previously.
Some low-priced items - such as long-distance
phone calls, gasoline, food products, and wrist-watches - were cheaper in
1992 in terms of hours worked to acquire them. But the higher-priced items - such as
housing, college educations, and health care - were far more costly than
ever.
The report concludes:
The average U.S. household has maintained its living standard largely
because families are working more hours. Millions of women entered the work
force in the past 25 years. In 1970, about 21 million women worked full
rime. Now that figure is over 36 million. That has helped to keep family
buying power fairly stable. But for many families, it now represents the
labor of two earners rather than one.1
1. "Has Our Living Standard Stalled?" Consumer Reports, June, 1992, p. 392.
The message here is that real wages in America
have declined.
Young couples
with a single income now have a lower standard of
living than their parents did. In spite of two incomes, the real net worth
of the average household is falling. The amount of leisure time is
shrinking. The percentage of Americans who own their homes is dropping.
The
age at which a family acquires a first home is rising. The number of
families counted among the middle class is falling. The size of the family
savings is smaller. The number of people living below the officially defined
poverty level is rising. The rate of personal bankruptcy is triple of what
it was in the 1960s.
Over 90% of all Americans are broke at age 65.
THE NEW WORLD ORDER
None of this is happening by accident.
Chapters five and six documented the
currently unfolding plan to create a functional world government within the
framework of the United Nations. Often referred to as The New World Order
by its advocates, the proposed global government is designed upon the
principles of socialism. It is the dream-come-true for the world's socialist
theoreticians, politicians, and technicians who see it as the ultimate
laboratory for their social experiments upon mankind.
There are two weapons of control now being readied at the UN. One is a world
military command which eventually will control all national armies and super
weapons. That is being accomplished under the slogans of peace and
disarmament. The other is a world central bank, now called the IMF/World
Bank, with the ability to issue a common money which all nations must
accept.
That is being accomplished under the slogans of international trade
and economic growth.
Of the two weapons, monetary control is the most important. The use of
military force is viewed as a crude weapon in the arsenal of world
government, to be used only as a last resort. The effect of monetary control
is more powerful than mega-tons of atomic energy. It reaches into every shop
and home, a feat that could never be accomplished by standing armies. It can
be used with precision against one nation, one group, or even one person
while sparing or benefiting all others.
Military force may be irresistible
but it causes resentment and political unrest that can smolder for decades.
Since monetary manipulation is seldom understood by its victims, it does not
incur their wrath. In fact, the manipulators enjoy high social status and
financial reward. For these reasons, monetary control is the weapon of
choice in
The New World Order.
A future world parliament based upon the concept of minimum coercion and
maximum freedom could be a wonderful advent for mankind. Without trying to
cram all nations into a centrally-directed beehive, it would welcome
cultural and religious variety. Instead of trying to place the world into a
collectivist straight-jacket of rules, regulations, quotas, and subsidies,
it would encourage diversity and freedom-to-choose.
Instead of levying
ever-larger taxes on every conceivable economic activity and destroying
human incentive in the process, it would encourage member nations to reduce
the taxes that already exist and thereby stimulate production and
creativity.
A world parliament, dedicated to the concept of freedom, would have to
withhold membership from any government that violated the basic rights of
its citizens. It could be the means by which totalitarian governments would
be encouraged to abandon their oppressive policies in order to obtain the
economic and political advantages of acceptance in the world body.
It could
become the greatest force for peace and prosperity and freedom we have ever
known.
But The New World Order that is now incubating at
the United Nations is an
entirely different creature. Its members represent just about every dictator
and warlord in the world. Its philosophy is built upon the socialist
doctrine that all good flows from the state. Those who do not conform must
be bent to the government's will or be eliminated.
It cannot oppose
totalitarianism for the simple reason that it is totalitarianism.
AMERICA IS THE TARGET
The New World Order cannot become a functional reality so long as the United
States remains able to go it alone.
America is viewed as a potential bull in
the china shop. Right now, it is safely under control, but the world
planners are worried it might break loose in the future. If the American
people were to awaken to the realities of world politics and regain control
over their government, they still would have the military and economic power
to break away.
Among the world planners, therefore, it has become the prime
directive to weaken the United States both militarily and economically. And
this directive has come from American leaders, not those of other countries.
CFR members sitting in the White House, the State Department, the Defense
Department, and the
Treasury are now working to finalize that part of the plan. It is yet one
more doomsday mechanism that, once it gains sufficient momentum, will pass
the critical point of no return.
The Korean War was the first time American soldiers fought under UN
authority.
That trend has accelerated and already includes military actions
in Iraq, Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti. By the time this book gets
to print, there undoubtedly will be more. While the American military is
being absorbed into the UN, steps are also underway to hand over American
atomic weapons. When that happens, the doomsday mechanism will become
activated. It will be too late to escape.
Likewise,
the IMF /
World Bank is already functioning - in conjunction with
the Federal Reserve System - as a world central bank. The American economy
is being deliberately exhausted through foreign giveaways and domestic
boondoggles.
The object is, not to help those in need or to preserve the
environment, but to bring the system dawn. When once-proud and independent
Americans are standing in soup lines, they will be ready to accept the
carefully arranged "rescue" by the world bank. A world currency is already
designed, awaiting only an appropriate crisis to justify its introduction.
From that, too, there will be no escape.
THE REPORT FROM IRON MOUNTAIN
The substance of these stratagems can be traced to a think-tank study
released in 1966 called
the Report from Iron Mountain.
Although the origin of the report is highly
debated, the document itself hints that it was commissioned by the
Department of Defense under Defense Secretary, Robert McNamara and was
produced by the Hudson Institute located at the base of Iron Mountain in
Croton-on-Hudson, New York. The Hudson Institute was founded and directed by
Herman Kahn, formerly of the Rand Corporation. Both McNamara and Kahn were
members of
The CFR.
The self-proclaimed purpose of the study was to explore various ways to
"stabilize society."
Praiseworthy as that may sound, a reading of the Report
soon reveals that the word society is used synonymously with the word
government. Furthermore, the word stabilize is used as meaning to preserve
and to perpetuate. It is clear from the start that the nature of the study
was to analyze the. different ways a government can perpetuate itself in
power, ways to control its citizens and prevent them from rebelling.
It was stated at the beginning of the report that morality was not an
issue. The study did not address questions of right or wrong; nor did it
deal with such concepts as freedom or human rights. Ideology was not an
issue, nor patriotism, nor religious precepts.
Its sole concern was how to
perpetuate the existing government.
The report said:
Previous studies have taken the desirability of peace, the importance of
human life, the superiority of democratic institutions, the greatest "good"
for the greatest number, the "dignity" of the individual, the desirability
of maximum health and longevity, and other such wishful premises as
axiomatic values necessary for the justification of a study of peace issues.
We have not found them so. We have attempted to apply the standards of
physical science to our thinking, the principal characteristic of which is
not quantification, as is popularly believed, but that, in Whitehead's
words,
"...it ignores all judgments of value; for instance, all esthetic and
moral judgments."
The major conclusion of the report was that, in
the past, war has been the
only reliable means to achieve that goal.
It contends that only during times
of war or the threat of war are the masses compliant enough to carry the
yoke of government without complaint. Fear of conquest and pillage by an
enemy can make almost any burden seem acceptable by comparison. War can be
used to arouse human passion and patriotic feelings of loyalty to the
nation's leaders.
No amount of sacrifice in the name of victory will be
rejected. Resistance is viewed as treason. But, in times of peace, people
become resentful of high taxes, shortages, and bureaucratic Intervention.
When they become disrespectful of their leaders, they become dangerous. No
government has long survived without enemies and armed conflict.
War,
therefore, has been an indispensable condition for "stabilizing society."
These are the report's exact words:
The war system not only has been essential to the existence of nations as
independent political entities, but has been equally indispensable to their
stable political structure. Without it, no , government has ever been able
to obtain acquiescence in its "legitimacy," or right to rule its society.
The possibility of war provides the sense of external necessity without
which no government can long remain in power.
The historical record reveals
one instance after another where the failure of a regime to maintain the
credibility of a war threat led to its dissolution, by the forces of private
interest, of reactions to social injustice, or of other disintegrative
elements. The organization of society for the possibility of war is its
principal political stabilizer...
It has enabled societies to maintain
necessary class distinctions, and it has insured the subordination of the
citizens to the state by virtue of the residual war powers inherent in the
concept of nationhood.1
A NEW DEFINITION OF PEACE
The report then explains that we are approaching a point in history where
the old formulas may no longer work.
Why? Because it may now be possible to
create a world government in which all nations will be disarmed and
disciplined by a world army, a condition which will be called peace.
The
report says:
"The word peace, as we have used it in the following pages...
implies total and general disarmament." 2
1. Mi, pp. 39, 81.
2. Ibid., p. 9.
Under that scenario, independent
nations will no longer exist and governments will not have the capability to
wage war.
There could be military action by the world army against renegade
political subdivisions, but these would be called peace-keeping operations,
and soldiers would be called peace keepers. No matter how much property is
destroyed or how much blood is spilled, the bullets will be "peaceful"
bullets and the bombs - even atomic bombs, if necessary - will be "peaceful"
bombs.
The report then raises the question of whether there can ever be a suitable
substitute for war? What else could the regional governments use - and what
could the world government itself use - to legitimize and perpetuate itself?
To provide an answer to that question was the stated purpose of the study.
The Report from Iron Mountain concludes that there can be no substitute for
war unless it possesses three properties.
It must,
(1) be economically
wasteful
(2) represent a credible threat of great magnitude
(3) provide a logical excuse for
compulsory service to the government
A SOPHISTICATED FORM OF SLAVERY
On the subject of compulsory service, the report explains that one of the
advantages of standing armies is that they provide a place for the
government to put antisocial and dissident elements of society.
In the
absence of war, these forced-labor battalions would be told they are
fighting poverty or cleaning up the planet or bolstering the economy or
serving the common good in some other fashion. Every teenager would be
required to serve - especially during those years in which young people are
most rebellious against authority.
Older people, too, would be drafted as a
means of working off tax payments and fines. Dissidents would face heavy
fines for "hate crimes'7 and politically incorrect attitudes so, eventually,
they would all be in the forced-labor battalions.
The report says:
We will examine... the time-honored use of military institutions to provide
anti-social elements with an acceptable role in the social structure... The
current euphemistic clichés - "juvenile delinquency" and "alienation" - have
had their counterparts in every age. In earlier days these conditions
were dealt with directly by the military without the complications of
due process, usually through press gangs or outright enslavement...
Most proposals that address themselves,
explicitly or otherwise, to the postwar problem of controlling the
socially alienated turn to some variant of the Peace Corps or the
so-called Job Corps for a solution. The socially disaffected, the
economically unprepared, the psychologically uncomfortable, the hardcore
"delinquents," the incorrigible "subversives" and the rest of the
unemployable are seen as somehow transformed by the disciplines of a
service modeled on military precedent into more or less dedicated social
service workers...
Another possible surrogate for the control of potential enemies of society
is the reintroduction, in some form consistent with modem technology and
political processes, of slavery... It is entirely possible that the
development of a sophisticated form of slavery may be an absolute
prerequisite for social control in a world at peace.
As a practical matter,
conversion of the code of military discipline to a euphemized form of
enslavement would entail surprisingly little revision; the logical first
step would be the adoption of some form of "universal" military service.
BLOOD GAMES
The report considered ways in which the public could be preoccupied with
non-important activities so that it would not have time to participate in
political debate or resistance.
Recreation, trivial game shows, pornography,
and situation comedies could play an important role, but blood games were
considered to be the most promising of all the options. Blood games are
competitive events between individuals or teams that are sufficiently
violent in nature to enable the spectators to vicariously work off their
frustrations.
As a minimum, these events must evoke a passionate team
loyalty on the part of the fans and must include the expectation of pain and
injury on the part of the players. Even better for their purpose is the
spilling of blood and the possibility of death. The common man has a morbid
fascination for violence and blood. Crowds gather to chant "Jump! Jump!" at
the suicidal figure on the hotel roof.
Cars slow to a near stop on the
highway to gawk at broken bodies next to a collision. A schoolyard fight
instantly draws a circle of spectators.
Boxing matches and football games
and hockey games and automobile races are telecast daily, attracting
millions of cheering fans who give rapt attention to each moment of danger,
each angry blow to the face, each broken bone, each knockout, each carrying
away of the unconscious or possibly dying contestant. In this fashion, their
anger at "society" is defused and focused, instead, on the opposing team.
The emperors of Rome devised the Circuses and gladiator contests and public
executions by wild beasts for precisely that purpose.
Before jumping to the conclusion that such concepts are absurd in modern
times, recall that during the 1985 European soccer championship in Belgium,
the spectators became so emotionally involved in the contest that a bloody
riot broke out in the bleachers leaving behind 38 dead and more that 400
injured.
U.S. News & World Report gives this account:
The root of the trouble: A tribal loyalty to home teams that surpasses an
obsession and, say some experts, has become a substitute religion for many.
The worst offenders include members of gangs such as Chelsea's
Anti-Personnel Firm, made up of ill-educated young males who find in soccer
rivalry an escape from boredom.
Still, the British do not have a patent on soccer violence. On May 26, eight
people were killed and more than 50 injured in Mexico City, -a 1964 stadium
riot in Lima, Peru, killed more than 300 - and a hotly disputed 1969 match
between El Salvador and Honduras led to a week-long shooting war between the
two countries, causing hundreds of casualties.
The U.S. is criticized for the gridiron violence of its favorite sport
football, but outbursts in the bleachers are rare because loyalties are
spread among many sports and national pride is not at stake. Said Thomas
Tutko, professor of psychology at California's San Jose State University:
"In these other countries, it used to be their armies. Now it's their
competitive teams that stir passions." 1
Having considered all the ramifications of blood games, the Report from Iron
Mountain concluded that they were not an adequate substitute for war.
It is
true that violent sports are useful distracters and do, in fact, allow an
outlet for boredom and fierce group loyalty, but their effect on the
nation's psyche could not match the intensity of war hysteria.
Until a
better alternative could be found, world government would have to be
postponed so that nations could continue to wage war.
FINDING A CREDIBLE GLOBAL THREAT
In time of war, most citizens uncomplainingly accept their low quality of
life and remain fiercely loyal to their leaders.
If a suitable substitute
for war is to be found, then it must also elicit that same reaction.
Therefore, a new enemy must be found that threatens the entire world, and
the prospects of being overcome by that enemy must be just as terrifying as
war itself.
The report is emphatic on that point:
Allegiance requires a cause; a cause requires an enemy. This much is
obvious; the critical point is that the enemy that defines the cause must
seem genuinely formidable.
Roughly speaking, the presumed power of the
"enemy" sufficient to warrant an individual sense of allegiance to a society
must be proportionate to the size and complexity of the society. Today, of
course, that power must be one of unprecedented magnitude and
frightfulness.2

June 10,1985, p.

The first consideration in finding a suitable threat to serve as a global
enemy was that it did not have to be real.
A real one would be better, of
course, but an invented one would work just as well, provided the masses
could be convinced it was real. The public will more readily believe some
fictions than others. Credibility would be more important than truth.
Poverty was examined as a potential global enemy but rejected as not fearful
enough. Most of the world was already in poverty. Only those who had never
experienced poverty would see it as a global threat. For the rest, it was
simply a fact of everyday life.
An invasion by aliens from outer space was given serious consideration. The
report said that experiments along those lines already may have been tried.
Public reaction, however, was not sufficiently predictable, because the
threat was not "credible."
Here is what the report had to say:
Credibility, in fact, lies at the heart of the problem of developing a
political substitute for war. This is where the space-race proposals, in
many ways so well suited as economic substitutes for war, fall short.
The
most ambitious and unrealistic space project cannot of itself generate a
believable external menace. It has been hotly argued that such a menace
would offer the "last best hope of peace" etc., by uniting mankind against
the danger of destruction by "creatures" from other planets or from outer
space.
Experiments have been proposed to test the credibility of an
out-of-our-world invasion threat; it is possible that a few of the more
difficult-to-explain "flying saucer" incidents of recent years were in fact
early experiments of this kind. If so, they could hardly have been judged
encouraging.1
1. Ibid., p. 66.
This report was released in 1966 when the idea of an alien presence seemed
far fetched to the average person.
In the ensuing years, however, that
perception has changed. A growing segment of the population now believes
that intelligent life forms may exist beyond our planet and could be
monitoring our own civilization.
Whether that belief is right or wrong is
not the issue here. The point is that a dramatic encounter with aliens shown
on network television - even if it were to be entirely fabricated by
high-tech computer graphics or laser shows in the sky - could be used to
stampede all nations into world government supposedly to defend the Earth
from invasion.
On the other hand, if the aliens were perceived to have
peaceful intent, an alternative scenario would be to form world government
to represent a unified human species speaking with a single voice in some
kind of galactic federation.
Either scenario would be far more credible
today than in 1966.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL-POLLUTION MODEL
The final candidate for a useful global threat was pollution of the
environment.
This was viewed as the most likely to succeed because it could
be related to observable conditions such as smog and water pollution - in
other words, it would be based partly on fact and, therefore, be credible.
Predictions could be made showing end-of-earth scenarios just as horrible as
atomic warfare. Accuracy in these predictions would not be important.
Their
purpose would be to frighten, not to inform. It might even be necessary to
deliberately poison the environment to make the predictions more convincing
and to focus the public mind on fighting a new enemy, more fearful than any
invader from another nation - or even from outer space.
The masses would
more willingly accept a falling standard of living, tax increases, and
bureaucratic intervention in their lives as simply,
"the price we must pay to
save Mother Earth."
If a vision of death and destruction from pollution
could be implanted into the public subconscious mind, then the global battle
against it could, indeed, replace war as the mechanism for control.
Did the
Report from Iron Mountain really say that? It certainly did - and
much more.
Here are just a few of the pertinent passages:
When it comes to postulating a credible
substitute for war... the "alternate enemy" must imply a more immediate,
tangible, and directly felt threat of destruction. It must justify the
need for taking and paying a "blood price" in wide areas of human
concern. In this respect, the possible substitute enemies noted earlier
would be insufficient.
One exception might be the
environmental-pollution model, if the danger to society it posed was
genuinely imminent. The fictive models would have to carry the weight of
extraordinary conviction, underscored with a not inconsiderable actual
sacrifice of life... It may be, for instance, that gross pollution of
the environment can eventually replace the possibility of mass
destruction by nuclear weapons as the principal apparent threat to the
survival of the species.
Poisoning of the air, and of the principal
sources of food and water supply, is already well advanced, and at first
glance would seem promising in this respect; it constitutes a threat
that can be dealt with only through social organization and political
power...
It is true that the rate of pollution could be increased selectively for
this purpose... But the pollution problem has been so widely publicized in
recent years that it seems highly improbable that a program of deliberate
environmental poisoning could be implemented in a politically acceptable
manner.
However unlikely some of the possible alternative enemies we have mentioned
may seem, we must emphasize that one must be found of credible quality and
magnitude, if a transition to peace is ever to come about without social
disintegration.
It is more probable, in our judgment, that such a threat
will have to be invented.
AUTHENTICITY OF THE REPORT
The Report from Iron Mountain states that it was produced by a Special
Study Group of fifteen men whose identities were to remain secret and that
it was not intended to be made public.
One member of the group, however,
felt the report was too important to be kept under wraps. He was not in
disagreement with its conclusions. He merely believed that more people
should read it. He delivered his personal copy to Leonard Lewin, a
well-known author and columnist who, in turn, negotiated its publication by
Dial Press. It was then reprinted by Dell Publishing.
This was during the Johnson Administration, and the President's Special
Assistant for National Security Affairs was CFR member Walt Rostow.
Rostow
was quick to announce that the report was a spurious work. Herman Kahn, CFR
director of the Hudson Institute, said it was not authentic. The Washington
Post - which is owned and run by CFR member Katharine Graham - called it "a
delightful satire."
Time magazine, founded by CFR-member Henry Luce, said it
was a skillful hoax. Then, on November 26,1967, the report was reviewed in
the book section of the Washington Post by Herschel McLandress, which was
the pen name for Harvard professor John Kenneth Galbraith. Galbraith, who
also had been a member of the CFR, said that he knew firsthand of the
report's authenticity because he had been invited to participate in it.
Although he was unable to be part of the official group, he was consulted
from time to time and had been asked to keep the project a secret.
Furthermore, while he doubted the wisdom of letting the public know about
the report, he agreed totally with its conclusions.
He wrote:
As I would put my personal repute behind the authenticity of this document,
so would I testify to the validity of its conclusions. My reservations
relate only to the wisdom of releasing it to an obviously unconditioned
public.1
Six weeks later, in an Associated Press dispatch from London, Galbraith went
even further and jokingly admitted that he was "a member of the
conspiracy."2
1. "News of War and Peace You're Not
Ready For/' by Herschel McLandress, Book World, in The Washington Post,
November 26, 1967, p. 5.
2. "The Times Diary/' London Times, February 5, 1 968, p . 8.
That, however, did not settle the issue.
The following day, Galbraith backed off. When
asked about his "conspiracy" statement, he replied:
"For the
first time since Charles II, The Times has been guilty of a misquotation... Nothing shakes my conviction that |t was written by either Dean Rusk or Mrs.
Clare Booth Luce."1
The reporter who conducted the original interview was
embarrassed by the
allegation and did further research.
Six days later, this is what he
reported:
Misquoting seems to be a hazard to which Professor Galbraith is prone. The
latest edition of the Cambridge newspaper Varsity quotes the following (tape
recorded) interchange:
Interviewer: "Are you aware of the identity of the author of Report from
Iron Mountain?"
Galbraith: "I was in general a member of the conspiracy but I was not the
author. I have always assumed that it was the man who wrote the foreword -
Mr. Lewin." 2
So, on at least three occasions, Galbraith publicly endorsed the
authenticity of the report but denied that he wrote it.
Then who did? Was it
Leonard Lewin, after all? In 1967 he said he did not. In 1972 he said that
he did.
Writing in the New York Times Book Review Lewin explained:
"I wrote
the 'Report/ all of it... What I intended was simply to pose the issues of
war and peace in a provocative way." 3
1. "Galbraith Says He Was
Misquoted,"London Times, February 6, 1968, p. 3.
2. "Touche, Vrofessor/'London Times, February 12, 1968, p. 8.
3. "Report from Iron Mountain/'Nea; York Times, March 19, 1968, p. 8.
But wait! A few years before that, columnist William F, Buckley
told the New
York Times that he was the author.
That statement was undoubtedly made
tongue-in-cheek, but who - and what are we to Believe?
Was it written by,
-
Herman Kahn
-
John Kenneth Galbraith
-
Dean Rusk
-
Clare Booth Luce
-
Leonard Lewin
-
or William F. Buckley?
In the final analysis, it make little difference.
The important point is
that The Report from Iron Mountain, whether written as a Blink-tank study or
a political satire, explains the reality that surrounds us.
Regardless of
its origin, the concepts presented in it are now being implemented in almost
every detail. All one has to Bo is hold the Report in one hand and the daily
newspaper in the other to realize that every major trend in American life is
conforming to the blueprint.
So many things that otherwise are
incomprehensible suddenly become clear: foreign aid, wasteful spending, the
destruction of American industry, a job corps, gun control, a national
police force, the apparent demise of Soviet power, a UN army, disarmament, a
world bank, a world money, the surrender of national independence through
treaties, and the ecology hysteria.
The Report from Iron Mountain is an
accurate summary of the plan that has already created our present. It is now
shaping our future.
ENVIRONMENTALISM A SUBSTITUTE FOR WAR
It is beyond the scope of this study to prove that currently accepted
predictions of environmental doom are based on exaggerated and fraudulent
"scientific studies".
But such proof is easily found if one is willing to
look at the raw data and the assumptions upon which the projections are
based. More important, however, is the question of why end-of-world
scenarios based on phony scientific studies - or no studies at all - are
uncritically publicized by the CFR-controlled media; or why radical
environmental groups advocating socialist doctrine and anti-business
programs are lavishly funded by CFR-dominated foundations, banks, and
corporations, the very groups that would appear to have the most to lose.
The Report from Iron Mountain answers those questions.
As the Report pointed out, truth is not important in these matters. It's
what people can be made to believe that counts. "Credibility" is the key,
not reality. There is just enough truth in the fact of environmental
pollution to make predictions of planetary doom in the year
two-thousand-something seem believable. All that is required is media
cooperation and repetition. The plan has apparently worked.
People of the
industrialized nations have been subjected to a barrage of documentaries,
dramas, feature films, ballads, poems, bumper stickers, posters, marches,
speeches, seminars, conferences, and concerts. The result has been
phenomenal. Politicians are now elected to office on platforms consisting of
nothing more than an expressed concern for the environment and a promise to
clamp down on those nasty industries.
No one questions the damage done to
the economy or the nation. It makes no difference when the very planet on
which we live is sick and dying. Not one in a thousand will question that
underlying premise. How could it be false? Look at all the movie celebrities
and rock stars who have joined the movement.
While the followers of the environmental movement are preoccupied with
visions of planetary doom, let us see what the leaders are thinking.
The
first Earth Day was proclaimed on April 22, 1970, at a "Summit" meeting in
Rio de Janeiro, attended by environmentalists and politicians from all over
the world. A publication widely circulated at that meeting was entitled the
Environmental Handbook.
The main theme of the book was summarized by a
quotation from Princeton Professor Richard A. Falk, a member of the CFR.
Falk wrote that there are four interconnected threats to the planet - wars
of mass destruction, overpopulation, pollution, and the depletion of
resources.
Then he said:
"The basis of all four problems is the inadequacy
of the sovereign states to manage the affairs of mankind in the twentieth
century."
The Handbook continued the CFR line by asking these rhetorical
questions:
"Are nation-states actually feasible, now that they have power to
destroy each other in a single afternoon?... What price would most people be
willing to pay for a more durable kind of human organization - more taxes,
giving up national flags, perhaps the sacrifice of some of our hard-won
liberties?"
In 1989, the CFR-owned Washington Post published an article written by CFR
member George Kennan in which he said:
"We must prepare instead for... an
age where the great enemy is not the Soviet Union, but the rapid
deterioration of our planet as a supporting structure for civilized life."
On March 27,1990, in the CFR-controlled New York Times, CFR member
Michael
Oppenheimer wrote:
"Global warming, ozone depletion, deforestation and
overpopulation are the four horsemen of a looming 21st century
apocalypse... As the cold war recedes, the environment is becoming the No.
1 international security concern."
CFR member, Lester Brown, heads up another think tank called the
Worldwatch
Institute.
In the Institute's annual report, entitled State of the World
1991, Brown said that,
"the battle to save the planet will replace the battle
over ideology as the organizing theme of the new world order."
In the official publication of the 1992 Earth Summit, we find this:
"The
world community now faces together greater risks to our common security
through our impacts on the environment than from traditional military
conflicts with one another."
How many times does it have to be explained?
The environmental movement was
created by the CFR.
It is a substitute for war that they hope will become
the emotional and psychological foundation for world government.
HUMANITY ITSELF IS THE TARGET
The Club of Rome is a group of global planners who annually release
end-of-world scenarios based on predictions of overpopulation and famine.
Their membership is international, but the American roster includes such
well-known CFR members as,
-
Jimmy Carter
-
Harlan Cleveland
-
Claiburne Pell
-
Sol Linowitz
Their
solution to overpopulation? A world government to control birth rates and, if necessary, apply euthanasia.
That is a gentle
word for the deliberate killing of the old, the weak, and of course the
uncooperative.
Following the same reasoning advanced at Iron Mountain, the
Club of Rome has concluded that fear of environmental disaster could be used
as a substitute enemy for the purpose of unifying the masses behind their
program.
In their 1991 book entitled The First Global Revolution, we find
this:
In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that
pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the
like would fit the bill... All these dangers are caused by human
intervention... The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.
Socialist theoreticians have always been fascinated by the question of
controlling population growth. It excites their imagination because it is
the ultimate bureaucratic plan. If the real enemy is humanity itself, as the
Club of Rome says, then humanity itself must become the target.
Fabian
Socialist Bertrand Russell expressed it thus:
I do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which population can
be kept from increasing...
War, as I remarked a moment ago, has
hitherto been disappointing in this respect, but perhaps bacteriological
war may prove more effective. If a Black Death could be spread
throughout the world once in every generation, survivors could procreate
freely without making the world too full...
A scientific world society cannot be stable unless there is world
government... It will be necessary to find ways of preventing an increase in
world population. If this is to be done otherwise than by wars, pestilences
and famines, it will demand a powerful international authority. This
authority should deal out the world's food to the various nations in
proportion to their population at the time of the establishments of the
authority.
If any nation subsequently increased its population, it should
not on that account receive any more food. The motive for not increasing
population would therefore be very compelling.
Very compelling, indeed.
These quiet-spoken socialists are not kidding
around. For example, one of the most visible "environmentalists" and
advocate of population control is Jacques Cousteau. Interviewed by the
United Nations UNESCO Courier in November of 1991, Cousteau spelled it out.
Speaking of death by cancer, he said:
Should we eliminate suffering diseases? The idea is beautiful, but perhaps
not a benefit for the long term. We should not allow our dread of diseases
to endanger the future of our species. This is a terrible thing to say.
In
order to stabilize world population, we must eliminate 350,000 people per
day. It is a horrible thing to say, but it's just as bad not to say it.3

GORBACHEV BECOMES AN ECOLOGY WARRIOR
We can now understand how Mikhail Gorbachev, formerly the leader of one of
the most repressive governments the world has known, became head of a new
organization called the International Green Cross, which supposedly is
dedicated to environmental
issues.
Gorbachev has never denounced socialism, only the label of a
particular brand of socialism called Communism.
His real interest is not
ecology but world government with himself assured a major position in the
socialist power structure. In a public appearance in Fulton, Missouri, he
praised the Club of Rome, of which he is a member, for its position on
population control.
Then he said:
One of the worst of the new dangers is ecological... Today, global climatic
shifts; the greenhouse effect; the "ozone hole"; acid rain; contamination of
the atmosphere, soil and water by industrial and household waste; the
destruction of the forests; etc. all threaten the stability of the planet.1
Gorbachev proclaimed that global government was the answer to these threats
and that the use of government force was essential.
He said:
"I believe that
the new world order will not be fully realized unless the United Nations and
its Security Council create structures... authorized to impose sanctions
and make use of other measures of compulsion."
Here is an arch criminal who fought his way up through the ranks of the
Soviet Communist Party, became the protégé of Yuri Andropov, head of the
dreaded KGB, was a member of the USSR's ruling Politburo throughout the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and who was selected by the Politburo in
1985 as the supreme leader of world Communism.
All of this was during one of
the Soviet's most dismal periods of human-rights violations and subversive
activities against the free world. Furthermore, he ruled over a nation with
one of the worst possible records of environmental destruction.
At no time
while he was in power did he ever say or do anything to show concern over
planet Earth.
All that is now forgotten. Gorbachev has been transformed by the
CFR-dominated media into an ecology warrior. He is calling for world
government and telling us that such a government will use environmental
issues as justification for sanctions and other "measures of compulsion."
We
cannot say that we were not warned.
U.S. BRANDED AS ECOLOGICAL AGGRESSOR
The use of compulsion is an important point in these plans, people in the
industrialized nations are not expected to cooperate In their own demise.
They will have to be forced. They will not like It when their food is taken
for global distribution. They will not approve when they are taxed by a
world authority to finance foreign political projects. They will not
voluntarily give up their tars or resettle into smaller houses or communal
barracks to satisfy Hie resource-allocation quotas of a UN agency.
Club-of-Rome member Maurice Strong states the problem:
In effect, the United States is committing environmental aggression against
the rest of the world... At the military level, the United States is the
custodian. At the environmental level, the United States is clearly the
greatest risk... One of the worst problems in the United States is energy
prices - they're too low...
It is clear that current lifestyles and consumption patterns of the affluent
middle class... involving high meat intake, consumption of large amounts of
frozen and 'convenience' foods, ownership of motor-vehicles, numerous
electric household appliances, home and I work-place air-conditioning ...
expansive suburban housing... are not sustainable.1
Mr. Strong's remarks were enthusiastically received by world Environmental
leaders, but they prompted this angry editorial response in the Arizona
Republic:
Translated from eco-speak, this means two things:
(1) a reduction in the
standard of living in Western nations through massive new taxes and
regulations
(2) a wholesale transfer of wealth from industrialized to
under-developed countries.
The dubious premise here is that if the U.S.
economy could be reduced to, say, the size of Malaysia's, the world would be
a better place... Most Americans probably would balk at the idea of the
U.N. banning automobiles in the U.S.2
Who is this
Maurice Strong who sees the United States as the environmental
aggressor against the world? Does he live in poverty? Does he come from a
backward country that is resentful of American prosperity? Does he himself
live in modest circumstances, avoiding consumption in order to preserve our
natural resources?
None of the above. He is one of the wealthiest men in the
world. He lives and travels in great comfort. He is a lavish entertainer.
In
addition to having great personal wealth derived from the oil industry in
Canada - which he helped nationalize - Maurice Strong was,
-
the
Secretary-General of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio
-
head of the 1972 UN
Conference on Human Environment in Stockholm
-
the first Secretary-General of
the UN Environment Program
-
president of the World Federation of United
Nations
-
co-chairman of the World Economic Forum
-
member of the Club of
Rome
-
trustee of the Aspen Institute
-
a director of the World Future
Society
That is probably more than you wanted to know about this man, but
it is necessary in order to appreciate the importance of what follows.
A PLOT FOR ECONOMIC CRISIS
Maurice Strong believes - or says that he believes - the world's ecosystems
can be preserved only if the affluent nations of the world can be
disciplined into lowering their standard of living.
Production and
consumption must be curtailed. To bring that about, those nations must
submit to rationing, taxation, and political domination by world government.
They will probably not do that voluntarily, he says, so they will have to be
forced. To accomplish that, it will be necessary to engineer a global
monetary crisis which will destroy their economic systems. Then they will
have no choice but to accept assistance and control from the UN.
This strategy was revealed in the May, 1990, issue of West magazine,
published in Canada. In an article entitled "The Wizard of Baca Grande,"
journalist Daniel Wood described his week-long experience at Strong's
private ranch in southern Colorado.
This ranch has been visited by such CFR
notables as,
During Wood's stay at the ranch, the tycoon talked freely about
environmentalism and politics.
To express his own world view, he said he was
planning to write a novel about a group of world leaders who decided to save
the planet. As the plot unfolded, it became obvious that it was based on
real people and real events.
Wood continues the story:
Each year, he explains as background to the telling of the novel's plot, the
World Economic Forum convenes in Davos, Switzerland. Over a thousand CEOs,
prime ministers, finance ministers, and leading academics gather in February
to attend meetings and set economic agendas for the year ahead.
With this as
a setting, he then says:
"What if a small group of these world leaders were
to conclude that the principal risk to the earth comes from the actions of
the rich countries? And if the world is to survive, those rich countries
would have to sign an agreement reducing their impact on the environment.
'Will they do it?... The group's conclusion is 'no.' the rich countries
won't do it. They won't change. So, in order to save the planet, the group
decides: Isn't the only hope for the planet that the industrialized
civilizations collapse? Isn't it our responsibility to bring that about?."
"This group of world leaders," he continues, "form a secret society to bring
about an economic collapse. It's February. They're all at Davos. These
aren't terrorists. They're world leaders. They have positioned themselves in
the world's commodity and stock markets. They've engineered, using their
access to stock exchanges and computers and gold supplies, a panic. Then,
they prevent the world's stock markets from closing. They jam the gears.
They hire mercenaries who hold the rest of the world leaders at Davos as
hostages. The markets cant close. The rich countries..."
And Strong makes a
slight motion with his fingers as if he were flicking a cigarette butt out
the window.
I sit there spellbound.
This is not any storyteller talking, this is Maurice
Strong. He knows these world leaders. He is, in fact, co-chairman of the
Council of the World Economic Forum. He sits at the fulcrum of power. He is
in a position to do it.
"I probably shouldn't be saying things like this," he says.
Maurice Strong's fanciful plot probably shouldn't be taken too
seriously, at
least in terms of a literal reading of future events.
It is unlikely they will unfold in exactly that
manner - although it is not impossible. For one
thing, it would not be necessary to hold the leaders of the industrialized
nations at gun point. They would be the ones engineering this plot. Leaders
from Third-World countries do not have the means to cause a global crisis.
That would have to come from the money centers in New York, London, or
Tokyo. Furthermore, the masterminds behind this thrust for global
government have always resided in the industrialized nations. They have come
from the ranks of the CFR in America and from other branches of the
International Roundtable in England, France, Belgium, Canada, Japan, and
elsewhere.
They are the
ideological descendants of
Cecil Rhodes and they are
fulfilling his dream.
It is not important whether or not Maurice Strong's plot for global economic
collapse is to be taken literally. What is important is that men like him
are thinking along those lines. As Wood pointed out, they are in a position
to do it. Or something like it. If it is not this scenario, they will
consider another one with similar consequences.
If history has proven
anything, it is that men with financial and political power are quite
capable of heinous plots against their fellow men. They have launched wars,
caused depressions, and created famines to suit their personal agendas. We
have little reason to believe that the world leaders of today are more
saintly than their predecessors.
Furthermore, we must not be fooled by pretended concern for Mother Earth.
The call-to-arms for saving the planet is a gigantic ruse.
There is just
enough truth to environmental pollution to make the show "credible," as
The
Report from Iron Mountain phrased it, but the end-of-earth scenarios which
drive the movement forward are bogus. The real objective in all of this is
world government, the ultimate doomsday mechanism from which there can be no
escape.
Destruction of the economic strength of the industrialized nations
is merely a necessary prerequisite for ensnaring them into the global web.
The thrust of the current ecology movement is directed totally to that end.
SUMMARY
The United States government is mired in a 5-trillion-dollar debt.
By 1993,
net interest payments on that debt were running $214 billion per year. That
consumes about 14% of alb federal revenue and costs the average family over
$5,000 each year. Nothing is purchased by it. It merely pays interest. It
represents the government's largest single expense. Interest on the national
debt is already consuming more than 57% of all the revenue collected from
income taxes. At the present rate of expansion, it will consume 100% in
1998.
By 1992, there were more people working for government than for
manufacturing companies in the private sector. There are more citizens
receiving government checks than there are paying income taxes. When it is
possible for people to vote on issues involving the transfer of wealth to
themselves from others, the ballot box becomes a weapon whereby the majority
plunders the minority.
That is the point of no return. It is a doomsday
mechanism.
By 1992, more than half of all federal outlays went for what are called
entitlements. Here is another doomsday mechanism. Entitlements are expenses
- such as Social Security and Medicare - which are based on promises of
future payments.
Entitlements represent 52% of federal outlays. When this is
added to the 14% that is now being spent for interest payments on the
national debt, we come to the startling conclusion that two-thirds of all
federal expenses are now entirely automatic, and that percentage is growing
each month.
The biggest doomsday mechanism of all is the Federal Reserve System. Every
cent of our money supply came into being for the purpose of being loaned to
someone. Those dollars will disappear when the loans are paid back. If we
tried to pay off the national debt, our money supply would be undermined.
Under the Federal Reserve System, therefore, Congress would be fearful to
eliminate the national debt even if it wanted to.
Political environmentalism has caused millions of acres of timber and
agricultural land to be taken out of production. Heavy industry has been
chased from our shores by our own government. High taxes, rules beyond
reason for safety devices in the work place, so-called fair-employment
practices, and mandatory health insurance are rapidly destroying what is
left of the private sector.
The result is unemployment and dislocation for
millions of American workers. Government moves in to fill the void it
creates, and bureaucracy grows by the hour.
Federal taxes now take more than 40% of our private incomes. State, county,
and local taxes are on top of that. Inflation feeds on what is left. We
spend half of each year working for the government. Real wages in America
have declined. Young couples with a single income have a lower standard of
living than their parents did. The net worth of the average household is
falling. The amount of leisure time is shrinking.
The percentage of
Americans who own their homes is dropping. The age at which a family
acquires a first home is rising. The number of families counted among the
middle class is falling. The number of people living below the officially
defined poverty level is rising. Over 90% of all Americans are broke at age
65.
None of this is accidental. It is the fulfillment of a plan by members of
the CFR who comprise the hidden government of the United States. Their goal
is the deliberate weakening of the industrialized nations as a prerequisite
to bringing them into a world government built upon the principles of
socialism, with themselves in control.
The origin of many of the stratagems in this plan can be traced to a
government-sponsored think-tank study released in 1966 called the Report
from Iron Mountain. The purpose of the study was to analyze methods by which
a government can perpetuate itself in power - ways to control its citizens
and prevent them from rebelling.
The conclusion of the report was that, in
the past, war has been the only reliable means to achieve that goal.
Under
world government, however, war technically would be impossible. So the main
purpose of the study was to explore other methods for controlling
populations and keeping them loyal to their leaders. It was concluded that a
suitable substitute for war would require a new enemy which posed a
frightful threat to survival. Neither the threat nor the enemy had to be
real. They merely had to be believable.
Several surrogates for war were considered, but the only one holding real
promise was the environmental-pollution model.
This was viewed as the most
likely to succeed because,
-
it could be related to observable conditions
such as smog and water pollution - in other words, it would be based partly
on fact and, therefore, believable
-
predictions could be made
showing end-of-earth scenarios just as horrible as atomic warfare.
Accuracy
in these predictions would not be important. Their purpose would be to
frighten, not to inform.
While the followers of the current environmental movement are preoccupied
with visions of planetary doom, the leaders have an entirely different
agenda. It is world government.
Chapter Twenty-Five
A PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO
The future portrayed as a continuation of present trends including a
hypothetical banking crisis, massive inflation, collapse of the economy,
domestic violence, the issuance of a new UN money, the arrival of UN
"Peacekeeping" forces, and the final merger into The New World Order, a form
of high-tech feudalism.
We are ready now for the final trip in our time machine. On the control
panel in front of us are several selector switches.
The one on the left
indicates Direction of Time. Set it to Future. The switch on the right
indicates Primary Assumptions. Set it to the first notch which reads:
Present trends unaltered. Leave the Secondary-Assumption switch where it is.
The lever in the center is a throttle to determine speed of travel.
Nudge it
forward - and hang on tight!
A BANKING CRISIS
It is 4:05 in the morning. While New York City sleeps, the computers on the
fourth floor at Citibank are aware that a full-blown crisis is underway.
It
started in London - five hours ahead of the East coast - and within minutes
had spread like an electronic virus to Tokyo and Hong Kong. That was an hour
ago. Alarms are now sounding on computer terminals in all the trading
centers of the world, and automatic dialing devices are summoning money
managers to their board rooms.
The panic started from rumors that one of the large U.S. banks was in
trouble because of the simultaneous default of its loan to Mexico and the
bankruptcy of its second-largest corporate borrower. Yesterday afternoon,
the bank's president held a press conference and denied that these were
serious problems.
To reinforce his optimism, he announced that, on Friday,
the bank will be paying a higher-than-usual quarterly dividend. The
professional money managers were not convinced. They knew that writing off
these loans would wipe out the bank's entire net worth.
All American banks are now so intertwined in their operations that trouble
for one affects them all. By 5 A.M., the money-center banks are facing heavy
withdrawals from overseas depositors. By the time the sun peeks between the
New York skyscrapers, Americans are also taking their money. These are not
small transactions.
They involve other banks, insurance companies, and
investment funds. The average withdrawal is over $3 million. The reservoir
is draining fast.
It is now 7:45. The banks will soon be opening their doors, and already
newspaper reporters and TV crews are arriving outside. A plan of unified
action must be made quickly.
The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has arranged an emergency conference
call with the CEOs of all the major banks, including one who was located at
great effort at his fishing lodge in northern Canada. The President is also
tied into the telephone network but on a "silent-monitor" basis.
Other than
the Chairman, no one else knows he is listening.
TO SAVE THE BANKS IS TO SAVE THE WORLD
The CEO at Citibank quickly summarizes the problem. None of the banks will
be able to sustain withdrawals of this magnitude for more than about
forty-eight hours. Perhaps less.
The money is not in their vaults. It has
been put into interest-bearing loans.
Even if the loans were performing,
they would not have the money. Now that some of the larger loans are in
default, the problem is even worse. If the Fed doesn't provide the money,
the banks will have no choice but to close their doors and go out of
business. That would cause a collapse of the economy and untold suffering
Would follow.
Americans would be thrown out of work; families would go
hungry; national security would be weakened. And it would undoubtedly spread
to the entire world.
Who knows what dire consequences would follow - chaos,
famine, and riots here at home? Revolution abroad? The return of a
militaristic regime in Russia? Atomic war?
The Chairman cuts the monologue short. He is well aware that the banks must
not be allowed to fail. That, after all, was one of the reasons the Federal
Reserve was created. He wants to get on with the details of how to do it.
Yes,
the FDIC is already broke, but don't worry about that. Congress will
authorize a "loan" or some other mechanism for the Wed to create whatever
amount of new money the FDIC might need. If Congress moves too slowly, the
Fed has other technical means to accomplish the same result.
In the
meantime, unlimited funding will be available at the Fed's discount window
by 8 A.M., Eastern Standard time.
The printing presses are already running
at full capacity to provide the currency. Fleets of airplanes and armored
cars are standing by to deliver it. Furthermore, don't give up on those
defaulted loans. Congress will probably bailout the bankrupt American
corporation. And the President has said he will ask for additional funding
for the IMF/World Bank.
That money will be created by the Fed and carry the
stipulation that it must be [used by Mexico and other defaulting countries
to resume interest payments on their loans.
The bankers are told to open their doors to the public and act calm. The
press already knows that something is going on but not the seriousness of
it. So tell them only what they already know. Nothing more. If people want
to withdraw their money, give it to them. If lines should develop, call the
police to maintain order, but continue paying out.
Offer to stay open after
closing hours, if necessary, to accommodate everyone. Above all, have the
tellers lake their time. Check and double check each transaction Move the
lines slowly.
The armored trucks will arrive at the busiest hours so the guards can carry
sacks of money past the customers for visual confirmation that there is
enough for everyone. A bank officer then should tell the crowd that a fresh
delivery of money has just been made from the Federal Reserve System and
that there is plenty more where that came from.
Once people become convinced
that the bank is able to pay, most of them will tire of the wait and go home.
PANIC AVERTED
It is now 6 P.M. of the following day. The plan was successful.
Lines of
anxious depositors had formed yesterday morning, mostly In the larger
cities, and resumed again this morning. But there has peen enough money for
everyone. The news media treated the story lightly, making sure to include
sound bites from various experts that banks can no longer fail, thanks to
the FDIC and the
Federal Reserve System. More than half the video time is devoted to armored
trucks and guards carrying sacks of money.
The banks closed on schedule
today, and there were no more lines.
While everything appears calm to the passengers on deck, the fire still
rages out of control in the boiler room. Over a billion dollars has already
fled, mostly overseas, and the hemorrhage continues. The Fed is pumping in
fresh money to replace it. Two of the banks have instructed their computer
technicians to activate an automatic two-hour delay on all incoming
transactions.
There is talk of deliberately disabling the entire network and
blaming the breakdown on overload, but the idea is abandoned. There are too
many people in the system. Someone surely would leak the truth to the press.
The danger of a run on the banks by private depositors used to be the
nightmare of the Federal Reserve. Now it is nothing compared to the
electronic run that is taking place involving institutional depositors
around the world. These are professionals who are not impressed by armed
guards carrying bags of currency. They want their money now - and they are
getting it.
Although they are receiving it in the form of electronic
credits, they are immediately exchanging that for something more dependable,
such as stocks, other currencies, and bullion.
This is the Fed's finest hour. It is exercising its many powers, carefully
accumulated over the years, to create money out of whatever is at hand: U.S.
Treasury bonds, bonds from other governments, corporate debt obligations,
even direct loans to individuals and partnerships. Billions of new dollars
are springing into existence.
They are spreading around the globe to fulfill
the banks' obligation to give people back their money.
A REAL RUN ON THE BANKS
It is now seven weeks later. Something happened, but no one knows what.
Like
a spark igniting a twig, spreading to a branch, and then engulfing the
entire forest, the public has panicked. Responding to a primitive herd
instinct, they are descending on the banks and the thrifts. They want their
money. They want their savings.
Perhaps it was,
-
the newly released statistics showing higher unemployment
-
or
the continued rise in bankruptcies
-
or the Congressional vote to increase
the national debt again
-
or the jump in Social-Security taxes
-
or the loss
of another 140,000 jobs to Mexico
-
or the riots in Chicago and Detroit for
more food stamps and government housing
-
or the presence of UN
"Peacekeeping" troops to augment the National Guard
-
or the rumor that the
Bank of America was technically insolvent
-
or the UN World Court ruling that
the number of American automobiles had to be cut by 30% by December 31st
-
or
the skeptical tone in the voice of the CBS news anchor as he quoted the
latest prediction of renewed prosperity
Whatever it was, there are now long lines of sober-faced depositors outside
every bank.
There is not enough cash in the vaults to meet the demand. Most
money is checkbook money, which means it consists merely of magnetic
impulses in a computer. Only about five per cent of the monetary supply is
in the form of coins or currency. Most of that is already outside the banks
in cash registers, wallets, and mattresses.
The amount inside the banks is
only about one-half of one per cent. The Fed's emergency supply of currency
- a large quantity warehoused for exactly this kind of crisis - is
inadequate. This time, the printing presses cannot keep up.
Spokesmen from the Treasury and the Federal Reserve appear on TV and assure
the nation that there is no need for panic. Everything is under control. The
only problem is the irrational behavior of alarmists who have no faith in
their country.
No one believes them. The lines grow longer, and the people become angry.
Bank employees are jeered on their way to work. Bomb threats are made.
Sporadic violence breaks out, and bank windows are smashed.
The
International Guard is called up. The President declares a bank holiday.
Since people cannot close out their bank accounts by withdrawing currency,
they rush through the stores on checkbook-spending sprees. If they cannot
get their money back, at least they can buy things with it. Garages and
basements are filling up with canned goods, shoes, liquor, tires,
ammunition. Goods are becoming scarce, pushing prices upward. The Dow Jones
is going through the roof as investors empty their checking accounts to buy
anything for sale.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally suspends
trading.
Nine months have now passed. The crisis has been a blessing for politicians.
They have thrived upon it and grown in stature because of it. It has given
them an excuse to swarm through the country on fact-finding trips, to appear
in shirt sleeves at town-hall meetings, to give speeches, and to be seen on
television - all the time expressing grave concern and appearing to take
charge. It has legitimized their role and somehow made them seem more
necessary than before.
They have been converted in the public eye from oafs
and bumpkins to serious-minded statesmen.
The party in power said it inherited the mess. The previous party blamed the
current one for dropping the ball. Both parties, however, agreed on the
solution: more of exactly the same policies that created the crisis:
expanded power to the Federal Reserve, more government control over the
economy, more subsidies and benefits, and more international commitments.
These were called "emergency reforms" and became law. The same men who
created the problem prescribed the solution.
The public was grateful to have
leaders of such vision and wisdom.
BANK BAILOUT AND MORE INFLATION
The most important emergency reform was to bail out the banks with
taxpayers' dollars.
Defaulted foreign loans were taken over by the IMF/World
Bank, and the failing corporate borrowers were given government grants
disguised as loans - loans which everyone knew would never be paid back.
Next, the banks were nationalized, at least in part. In return for the
bailout money, they gave large blocks of stock to the government which now
operates as an official business partner. This was not a drastic change. The
banks were already heavily regulated by government, even to the point of
determining their profits, dividends, and executive salaries. That is the
way the cartel wanted it.
It was the means by which competition was avoided
and profits assured. Monetary scientists and political scientists have
always worked as a hidden partnership. This merely made the relationship
more visible.
Technically, no bank was allowed to fail. The Fed kept its promise on that.
When the troubled banks were taken over, all depositors with $100,000 or
less were fully protected. If they wanted their money and the bank didn't
have it, the Fed simply manufactured it. No one was worried about the value
of those dollars. They were just happy to have them.
Ten more months have now passed. Those new dollars are flooding throughout
the system. The money supply has increased by the amount of the bailout plus
the amount of new spending for welfare, health care, interest on the
national debt, and foreign aid, all of which are in a vertical climb.
Inflation has become institutionalized.
The dollar has been dethroned as the world's defacto currency.
Foreign
investors and central banks no longer have any use for dollars. They have
sent them back to the United States from whence they came. Over a trillion
of them have returned to our shores like a huge flock of homing pigeons that
fills the sky from horizon to horizon. They are buying our refrigerators,
automobiles, computers, airplanes, cargo ships, armored tanks, office
buildings, factories, real estate - pushing prices to levels that would have
seemed impossible a year ago.
A single postage stamp costs as many dollars
as once would have purchased a new TV set.
Most stores have stopped accepting checks and credit cards. Workers are paid
daily with bundles of paper money. People rush to the stores to purchase
groceries before prices rise even further. Commerce is paralyzed. Bank loans
and mortgages are unobtainable. Savings accounts have been destroyed,
including the cash values of insurance policies. Factories are shutting
down. Businesses are closing their doors. Barter is commonplace. Old silver
coins come out of private hoards and a hundred-dollar bill is exchanged for
one silver dime.
Following the crash of 1929, the supply of paper money was limited because
it was backed by silver, and the amount of silver itself was limited.
Those
who had money were able to buy up the assets of those who did not. Since
prices were falling, the longer they held on to their dollars, the more they
could buy. Now, things are exactly the opposite. There is nothing to back
the money supply except politics. There is no limit to the amount of
currency that can be created. It is just a question of printing and
delivering it. Money is abundant, and prices are rising.
Those who have
money are spending it as soon as possible to prevent further loss of
purchasing power. In the 1930s, everyone wanted dollars. Now, everyone wants
to get rid of them.
The Emergency Banking Regulation No. 1, originally issued in 1961, empowered
the Secretary of the Treasury - without consent of Congress - to seize
anyone's bank account, savings account, or
safe-deposit box. It also gave him the power to fix rents, prices, salaries,
and hourly wages, and to impose rationing.
This was to be done "in the event
of attack on the United States."
That phrase now has been changed to read:
"in the event of national emergency." The Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) has been expanded to administer the directives of the
Treasury.
FEMA also has the power to detain and forcibly relocate any
citizen "in the event of a national emergency."
NEW MONEY
Three more months have passed, and the President has declared a state of
national emergency.
Today, the Secretary of the Treasury announced that the
nations of the world had ratified a multilateral treaty that would solve the
inflationary problems of the United States. This will be accomplished
through the issuance of a new world-wide monetary unit called
the Bancor,
the name proposed by John Maynard Keynes at the Bretton Woods Conference in
1944.
This new money will restore our commerce and put a stop to inflation.
At last, said the Treasury Secretary, man will have total control over his
economic destiny. Money will now become his servant instead of his master.
The United States, he said, has agreed to accept the Bancor as legal tender
for all debts, public and private. The old money will still be honored but
will be phased out over a three-month period. After that date, Federal
Reserve Notes will no longer be valid. During the transition period, the old
money may be exchanged at any bank at the ratio of one Bancor for
five-hundred dollars.
All existing contracts expressed in dollars -
including home mortgages - are now converted to Bancors in that same ratio.
In the same announcement, the Secretary advised that the IMF/World Bank was
backing this new money with something far more precious than gold. Instead,
it will be backed by the assets of the world. These include bonds from the
participating governments plus millions of acres of wilderness lands that
have been deposited into the UN "Environmental Bank."
The National Parks
Land forests of the United States have been added to those reserves, and
they will now be under the supervision of the UN Wilderness Asset
Preservation and Enhancement Agency (WAPEA). From this pate forward, the
Federal Reserve System will operate as a subdivision of the IMF which is now
the central bank of the world.
Although the Secretary did not mention it in his public appearance, the UN
treaty also obligated the government to put restrictions on the use of
cash. Every citizen is to be issued an international ID card. The primary
purpose of these machine-readable cards is to provide positive
identification for all citizens at transportation depots and military
checkpoints.
They also can be used by the banks and stores to access
checking accounts, which are how called debit accounts.
Every citizen is being issued an account in a bank near his place of
residence. All payments by employers or government agencies will be made by
electronic transfer. Cash transactions larger than live Bancors will be
illegal in three months. Most expenditures will be paid by debit card.
That
is the only way in which the UN Monetary Transaction Tracking Agency (MTTA)
can combat counterfeiting and prevent money laundering by organized crime.
That, of course, is camouflage. The government complex issuing the new
money is the greatest perpetrator of counterfeiting and organized prime the
world has ever seen. The real targets are political dissidents and those
escaping taxes in the underground economy.
No one will be allowed to earn or buy or sell without this ID card, nor will
they be allowed to leave the country or even to migrate to another city. If
any government agency has reason to Bed-flag an individual, his card will
not clear, and he will be Rocked from virtually all economic transactions
and geographical movements. It is the ultimate control.
The new money offers the Cabal yet one more benefit. There can never be
another run on the banks, because it is now illegal to demand currency.
THE RISE OF REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS
Hyperinflation is fertile ground for the seeds of revolution.
Economic
despair led the masses to grasp at the promises of,
-
Lenin in Russia
-
Hitler
in Germany
-
Mussolini in Italy
-
Mao in China
It has now been three
years since that fateful run on the banks in New York, and inflation has not
abated, even with the introduction of the Bancor.
Now we are witnessing
massive public demonstrations in every major city for higher wages, more
jobs, larger government benefits, and more stringent price controls. Since
there are practically no goods in the stores at any price, the demonstrators
are also calling for higher output from government factories.
The
demonstrations have been organized by radical organizations advocating the
overthrow of the "decadent capitalist" system and the enthronement of
socialism in its place. The participants in the street do not understand the
words they chant. They are unaware that capitalism has been dead in America
for many years and that it is socialism they already have.
Nevertheless, there are tens of thousands of desperate people who are
attracted to the rhetoric of revolution. Terrorism and revolutionary
insurgency have become common occurrences in the major urban areas. The
ranks of the revolutionaries are swelled by those who come solely for the
looting that always follows.
People are frightened by these violent events and demand the restoration of
law and order. They are relieved when martial law is declared. They are
happy to see the international Guard patrolling their neighborhoods. They
are not resentful of being confined in their homes or arbitrarily detained
by soldiers. They are actually grateful for the omni-presence of the police
state.
It is curious that the revolutionary groups behind this violence have not
been inhibited by the government. To the contrary, they have been given
grants from CFR organizations, and their leaders have been treated
courteously by CFR politicians.
The CFR media have given them extended
coverage in the news and has presented their cause with sympathy. A few
dissidents have begun to wonder if the revolutionaries are but the unknowing
pawns of those in power and that their primary function is to frighten the
population into accepting the constraints of a police state.
Such voices, however, are quickly silenced. Those who question the
government or the media are branded as extremists at the lunatic fringe.
Authorities say that they are the cause of our present woes. They are
remnants of the old system based on profit-seeking and race-hating. They are
guilty of politically-incorrect attitudes and hate crimes. They are
sentenced to attitude-correction centers for psychological treatment and
rehabilitation.
Those who do not immediately recant are never seen again.
HOMES ARE NATIONALIZED
One of the first industries to feel the raw power of "emergency measures"
was the home industry.
During the early stages of inflation, people were
applying their increasingly worthless dollars to pay down their mortgages.
That was devastating to the lenders. They were being paid back in dollars
that were worth only a fraction of the ones they had loaned out.
The banking
crisis had paused the disappearance of savings and investment capital, so they were unable to issue new loans to replace the old. Besides, people
were afraid to sell their homes under such chaotic times and, if they did,
very few were willing to buy with interest rates that high. Old loans were
being paid off, and new loans were not replacing them. The S&Ls, which in
the 1980s had been in trouble because home prices were falling, now were
going broke because prices were rising.
Congress applied the expected political fix by bailing them out and taking
them over. But that did not stop the losses.
It merely transferred them to
the taxpayers. To put an end to the losses, Congress passed the Housing
Fairness and Reform Act (HFRA). It converted all Bancor-denominated
contracts to a new unit of value - called the "Fairness Value" - which is
determined by the National Average Price Index (NAPI) on Fridays of the
preceding week. This has nothing to do with interest rates.
It relates to Bancor values.
For the purpose of illustration, let us convert Bancors back
to dollars. A $50,000 loan on Friday became a $920,000 loan on Monday. Few
people could afford the payments. Thousands of angry voters stormed the
Capitol building in protest. While the mob shouted obscenities outside,
Congress hastily voted to declare a moratorium on all mortgage payments. By
the end of the day, no one had to pay anything!
The people returned to their
homes with satisfaction and gratitude for their wise and generous leaders.
That was only an "emergency" measure to be handled on a more sound basis
later on. Many months have now passed, and
Congress has not dared to tamper with the arrangement. The voters would
throw them out of office if they tried. Millions of people have been living
in their homes at no cost, except for county taxes, which were also beyond
the ability of anyone to pay. Following the lead of Congress, the counties
also declared a moratorium on their taxes - but not until the federal
government agreed to make up their losses under terms of the newly passed
Aid to Local Governments Act (ALGA).
Renters are now in the same position, because virtually all rental property
has been nationalized, even that which had been totally paid for by their
owners. Under HFRA, it is not "fair" for those who are buying their homes to
have an advantage over those who are renting.
Rent controls made it
impossible for apartment owners to keep pace with the rising costs of
maintenance and especially their rising taxes. Virtually all rental units
have been seized by county governments for back taxes. And since the
counties themselves are now dependent on the federal government for most of
their revenue, their real estate has been transferred to federal agencies in
return for federal aid.
All of this was pleasing to the voters who were gratified that their leaders
were "doing something" to solve their problems. It gradually became clear,
however, that the federal government was now the owner of all their homes
and apartments. The reality is that people are living in them only at the
pleasure of the government.
They can be relocated to other quarters if that
is what the government wants.
WAGE-PRICE CONTROLS AND WORK ARMIES
Meanwhile, the UN Wage and Price Stabilization Agency (WPSA) has instituted
wage and price controls to combat inflation. What few businesses were able
to survive the ravages of inflation are knocked out by these measures.
Vital
industries have been seized by the WPSA and prevented from closing.
When
employees refuse to work for low, fixed wages or to take the jobs assigned
to them, they are placed under arrest and convicted of anti-democratic
activities. Given a choice between prison or "volunteering" for the UN
Full
Employment and Environmental Restoration Army (FEERA), most of them chose
the army. They are now doing the work prescribed for them in return for food
and shelter.
Many have been reassigned to new jobs, new cities, even new
countries;
depending on the employment quotas established by the UN International Human
Resource Allocation Agency (IHRAA). Their families have been given living
quarters which are appropriate to their work status and their willingness to
cooperate.
Automobiles are now used only by the ruling elite who hold government
positions of authority. To the extent possible, workers have been relocated
to barracks which were constructed within walking distance of major
industries. Others use rapid-transit systems, which have been greatly
expanded by FEERA. For middle management and the more skilled workers who
are allowed to live in the suburbs, there are "Peoples' Van Pools" (PVPs)
that shuttle them to and from assigned boarding areas.
Last week, Maurice Strong, who is now the Director of IHRAA, toured the
fifteen regional subdivisions that have been carved out of the
North-American continent - including the former United States and Canada -
and expressed gratification that America, at last, has ceased to be an
aggressor against the world.
Another twenty years have slipped by, and we now find ourselves in The New
World Order. No one around us is sure exactly when it began. In fact, there
was no official starting date, no announcement in the media, no ceremony
with blaring of trumpets. Sometime during the past ten or fifteen years, it
became obvious that it just was, and everyone accepted it as the natural
evolution of political trends and necessities.
Now, a whole generation is in
place that has no memory of another way of life. Many of the older folks
have all but forgotten the details of their previous existence. And, of
course, many of them have been eliminated.
Schools and textbooks speak of
the bygone era as one of unbridled competition, selfishness, and injustice.
Previously commonplace possessions such as automobiles and private homes and
three pairs of shoes are hardly mentioned, and when they are, they are
derided as wasteful artifacts of a decadent society that, fortunately, has
ceased to exist
NO TAXES OR INFLATION OR DEPRESSIONS
The public is no longer concerned over high taxes. For the most part, there
are none.
Everyone works for the government - directly or indirectly - and
is paid by electronic transfer to a government-regulated bank which controls
all spending accounts. Even those large corporations which have been allowed
to maintain the appearance of private ownership are merely junior partners
of government. They are totally regulated and, at the same time, totally
protected from failure.
The amount each citizen receives for his labor is
determined by his technical usefulness and his political rank. His taxes are
pleasantly low or non-existent. The cost of government now is derived almost
totally from expansion of the money supply - and from the economic value of
the work battalions.
Each regional government of the world determines its spending needs and then
offers to sell bonds in the open market to raise the money. The IMF/World
Bank, acting as the UN's central bank, is the primary buyer. The Bank
determines how much money to allow each regional government and then
"purchases" that amount of bonds.
It accomplishes that by making an
electronic transfer of "credits" to one of its correspondent banks within
the region receiving the money.
Once that has happened, the local government
can draw upon those credits to pay its bills. Not a single tax dollar is
needed for any of that. The IMF/World bank simply creates the money and the
regional governments spend it.
In days gone by, this increase in the money supply would have caused prices
and wages to go up almost immediately. Not anymore. Prices and wages are
controlled. What does happen, however, is that the government is caught in
its own trap. It needs to keep the workers happy by giving them wage
increases, but it also needs to keep its factories functioning by allowing
price increases as well. The wage-price spiral, therefore, is not
eliminated.
It is merely delayed a few months. And, instead of happening in
response to the interplay of supply and demand in a free market, it is
directed by bureaucratic formula. The end result is the same either way. The
people of the world are still paying the cost of their international and
local governments through the hidden taxation called inflation.
In the chaotic past, the industrialized nations of the world went through
phases of disruptive inflation often exceeding 1000% per year.
That served a
purpose in helping to destroy public faith in their existing national
governments. It softened them up and made them more willing to accept
drastic changes in their life styles and their political institutions. It
paved the way to
The New World Order.
But now we have arrived, and extreme
inflation rates - at least in the absence of war - would cause public
dissatisfaction and be counterproductive. Inflation, therefore, has now been
institutionalized at a fairly constant 5% per year. That has been determined
to be the optimum level for generating the most revenue without causing
public alarm.
Five per cent, everyone agrees, is "moderate." They can live
with that. But we tend to forget that it is 5% per year, forever.
A 5% devaluation applies, not only to the money earned this year, but to all
that is left over from previous years. At the end of |he first year, the
original dollar is worth 95 cents. At the end of the second year, it is
reduced again by 5% leaving its worth at 90 cents, and so on.
After 20
years, the government will have confiscated 64% of every dollar we saved at
the beginning of our careers. After working 45 years, the hidden tax on
those dollars will be 90%. The government will take virtually all of them
over our lifetime.
Earned interest will partially offset this effect but it
will not alter the underlying reality of government confiscation.
EFFECT OF "MODEST" 5% INFLATION
For the past forty years, all the published charts illustrating the
decline
of the dollar from such-and-such a date to the "present" show the following
type of curve.
These, of course, are averages.
A few people in the middle class of the
bureaucracy will have managed to place some of their dollars into tangible
assets or income-producing securities - what few that remain - where they
are somewhat protected from the effects of inflation. For the vast majority,
however, inflation hedges constitute but a tiny fraction of all they have
earned over a lifetime.
And so we find that, in The New World Order, inflation has been
institutionalized at a "modest" level of five per cent. Once in every five
or six generations - as prices climb higher and higher - a new monetary unit
can be issued to replace the old in order to eliminate some of the zeros.
But no one will live long enough to experience more than one devaluation.
Each generation is unconcerned about the loss of the previous one. Young
people come into the process without realizing it is circular instead of
linear. They cannot comprehend the total because they were not alive at the
beginning and will not be alive at the end. In fact, there need not even be
an end. The process can be continued forever.
By this mechanism - and with the output of work battalions - government can
operate entirely without taxes. The lifetime output of every human being is
at its disposal. Workers are allowed a color TV, state-subsidized alcohol
and recreational drugs, and violent sports to amuse them, but they have no
other options. They cannot escape their class.
Society is divided into the
rulers and the ruled, with an administrative bureaucracy in between.
Privilege is now largely a right of birth. The worker class and even most of
the administrators serve masters whom they do not know by name. But serve
they do. Their new lords are the monetary and political scientists who
created and who now control The New World Order.
All of mankind is in a
condition of high-tech feudalism.
HIGH-TECH FEUDALISM
Inflation is not the only aspect of economic chaos that is now under
control.
Booms and busts in the business cycle are also a thing of the past.
Like direct taxes, there are no business cycles any more. Now that the
government has firm control over every economic check point, business cycles
simply are not allowed.
There is no speculation in the market, because no
one has funds with which to speculate. There are no expansions of
inventories or capital goods in order to maximize future profits, because
inventories now are determined by formula. Besides, profits are also
determined by formula and, although they are just large enough to keep pace
with inflation, they are guaranteed.
Chaos in the economy is now impossible because it is not tolerated. Neither
is a depression. Yes, there are hundreds of bullions of human beings living
under conditions of extreme hardship, and thousands die of starvation every
day, but depressions are outlawed. No politician, no author, no one in the
media [would dare to suggest that the system was a failure.
Each month the
government releases new statistics showing in some obscure way or another
that the economy is steadily improving.
Although people are starving
everywhere, hunger does not exist anymore. Although work battalions are
crammed into flimsy barracks and tents, and although older homes and
apartment buildings are falling down for lack of maintenance, forcing more
and more families to share their tiny, unheated dwellings - nevertheless,
the [housing shortage is officially being eliminated.
There are no more
problems in the economy, because they now are illegal.
VOICES FROM THE PAST
There is a message flashing on the front panel of our time machine.
It
reads:
Duplicate sequence in memory bank. Check years
1816, 1831, 1904, and
1949.
That tells us that the on-board computer was found a similarity
between what we are now viewing in the future and something that was
recorded in the past. We had better check it out. On your keyboard, type:
Send data to printer and press the key labeled Execute.
The first item is coming out of the printer now. It is a warning, m\ the
year 1816, Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to Sam Kercheval in which he
said:
We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and
servitude.
If we run into such debts as that we must be taxed in our meat
and in our drink, in our necessities and our comforts, in our labors and our
amusements... our people... must come to labor sixteen hours in the
twenty-four, give our earnings of fifteen of these to the government...
have no time to think, no means of calling our mis-managers to account.
But
be glad to obtain sustenance by hiring ourselves out to rivet their chains
on the necks of our fellow-sufferers... And this is the tendency of all
human governments... till the bulk of society is reduced to be mere
automatons of misery...
And the forehorse of this frightful team is public
debt. Taxation follows that, and in its train wretchedness and oppression.
Here is the second printout. It is a political commentary and a prophesy.
In
the year 1831, a young Frenchman, named Alexis de Tocqueville, toured the
United States to prepare an official report to his government on the
American prison system. His real interest, however, was the social and
political environment in the New World. He found much to admire in America
but he also observed what he thought were the seeds of its destruction.
Upon
his return to France the following year, he began work on a four-volume
analysis of the strengths and weaknesses he found. His perceptivity was
remarkable, and his work, entitled Democracy in America, has remained as one
of the world's classic works in political science.
This is the part that our
computer recognized:
The Americans hold that in every state the supreme power ought to emanate
from the people; but when once that power is constituted, they can conceive,
as it were, no limits to it, and they are ready to admit that it has the
right to do whatever it pleases...
The idea of rights inherent in certain
individuals is rapidly disappearing from the minds of men; the idea of the
omnipotence and sole authority of society at large rises to fill its
place...
The first thing that strikes the observation is an innumerable multitude of
men, all equal and alike, incessantly endeavoring to procure the petty and
paltry pleasures with which they glut their lives. Each of them, living
apart, is a stranger to the fate of all the rest; his children and his
private friends constitute to him the whole of mankind...
Above this race of men stands an immense and tutelary power, which takes
upon itself alone to secure their gratifications and to watch over their
fate. That power is absolute, minute, regular, provident, and mild. It would
be like the authority of a parent, if like that authority, its object was to
prepare men for manhood; but it seeks, on the contrary, to keep them in
perpetual childhood: it is well content that the people should rejoice,
provided they think of nothing but rejoicing...
After having thus successively taken each member of the community in its
powerful grasp and fashioned him at will, the supreme power then extends its
arm over the whole community. It covers the surface of society with a
network of small, complicated rules, minute and uniform, through which the
most original minds and the most energetic characters cannot penetrate, to
rise above the crowd.
The will of man is not shattered, but softened, bent,
and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are constantly
restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy, but it prevents
existence; it does not tyrannize, but it compresses, enervates,
extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing
better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the
government is the shepherd...
Our contemporaries are constantly excited by two conflicting passions: they
want to be led, and they wish to remain free.
As they cannot destroy either
the one or the other of these contrary propensities, they strive to satisfy
them both at once. They devise a sole, tutelary, and all-powerful form of
government, but elected by the people. They combine the principle of centralization and that of popular
sovereignty; this gives them a respite: they console themselves for being in
tutelage by the reflection that they have chosen their own guardians.
Every
man allows himself to be put in leading-strings, because he sees that it is
not a person or a class of persons, but the people at large who hold the end
of his chain.
By this system the people shake off their state of dependence
just long enough to select their master and then relapse into it again.

EDUCATION AS A TOOL FOR HUMAN ENGINEERING
The third printout is dated 1904 and is a report issued by the General
Education Board, one of the first foundations established by John D.
Rockefeller, Sr.
The purpose of the foundation was to use the power of
money, not to raise the level of education in America, as was widely
believed at the time, but to influence the direction of that education.
Specifically, it was to promote the Ideology of collectivism and
internationalism.
The object was to use the classroom to teach attitudes
that encourage people to be passive and submissive to their rulers.
The goal
was - and is - to create citizens who are educated enough for productive
work under Supervision but not enough to question authority or seek to rise
above their class. True education was to be restricted to the sons and
daughters of the elite. For the rest, it would be better to produce skilled
workers with no particular aspirations other than BD enjoy life.
It was
enough, as de Tocqueville phrased it,
"that the people should rejoice,
provided they think of nothing but rejoicing."
In the first publication of the General Education Board,
Fred Gates
explained the plan:
In our dreams we have limitless resources, and the people yield themselves
with perfect docility to our molding hands.
The present educational
conventions fade from our minds, and unhampered by tradition, we work our
own good upon a grateful and responsive rural folk. We shall not try to make
these people or any of their children into philosophers of mental learning
or of science. We have not to raise from among them authors, editors, poets,
or men of letters.
We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters,
musicians, nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen of whom
we have ample supply.
The task we set before ourselves is very simple as
well as a very beautiful one: To train these people as we find them to a
perfectly ideal life just where they are... in the homes, in the shop, and
on the farm.1

BACK TO THE FUTURE
Here is the fourth computer printout from the past. It is a satire - and a
warning.
In the year 1949, George Orwell wrote his classic novel entitled
1984. In it, he portrayed the same "futuristic" scenes that now lie before
us as we sit in our time machine. His only error appears to have been the
date that became the title of his book. If he were writing it today, it is
likely he would call it 2054.
Orwell described the world of our future as being divided into three regions
called Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia.
Oceania consists of the Americas plus
England, Australia, and the Pacific Islands; Eurasia is Russia and
continental Europe; Eastasia comprises China, Japan, Southeast Asia, &
India. These superstates are constantly at war with each other. The wars are
not fought to conquer the enemy, they are waged for the primary purpose of
controlling the population.
The people in all three territories tolerate
their misery and oppression because sacrifices are necessary in time of war.
Most of the stratagems outlined in The Report from Iron Mountain are to be
found in Orwell's narrative, but Orwell described them first. The think-tank
was even willing to credit Orwell as the source of some of its concepts. For
example, on the subject of establishing a modern, sophisticated form of
slavery, the group at Iron Mountain said:
Up to now, this has been suggested only in fiction, notably in the works of
Wells, Huxley, Orwell, and others engaged in the imaginative anticipation of
the sociology of the future. But the fantasies projected in Brave New World
and 1984 have seemed less and less implausible over the years since their
publication.
The traditional association of slavery with ancient
preindustrial cultures should not blind us to its adaptability to advanced
forms of social organization.
From this we see that Orwell's work is far more than an entertaining novel.
It is relevant to our present journey in time. Our would-be masters have
studied him carefully. So should we.
This is what he wrote:
These three superstates are permanently at war, and have been so for the
past twenty-five years.
War, however, is no longer the desperate,
annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the twentieth
century... This is not to say that either the conduct of the war, or the
prevailing attitude toward it, has become less bloodthirsty or more
chivalrous.
On the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all
countries, and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the
reduction of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners
which extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal...
The primary aim of modem warfare... is to use up the products of the machine
without raising the general standard of living. [The "machine" is society's
technical and industrial capacity to produce goods.]...
From the moment when the machine first made its
appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human
drudgery, and therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had
disappeared. If the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger,
overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few
generations...
But it was also clear that an all-around increase in wealth threatened the
destruction - indeed in some cases was the destruction - of a hierarchical
society.
In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat,
lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a
motorcar or even an airplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most
important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once
became general, wealth would confer no distinction...
Such a society could
not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all
alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty
would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once
they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged
minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a
hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and
ignorance...
The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but
of the products of human labor. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or
pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking into the depths of the sea,
materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable,
and hence, in the long run, too intelligent...
In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the
result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but
this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the
favored groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state
of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies
the distinction between one group and another...
The social atmosphere is
that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes
the difference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time the
consequences of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing
over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition
of survival...
War, it will be seen, not only accomplishes the necessary destruction, but
accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle it would
be quite simple to waste the surplus labor of the world by building temples
and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even by
producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them.
But this
would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a
hierarchical society...
War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair... waged by each
ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to
make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society
intact.1
1. George Orwell,
1984
(New York: New American
Library/Signet, 1949), pp 153-164.
THE FUNCTION OF WASTE IN MODERN TOTALITARIANISM
Once again, it is clear that Orwell's grim narrative was a primary model for
The Report from Iron Mountain.
The authors of that blueprint for our future
spoke at length about the value of planned waste as a means of preventing
the masses from improving their standard of living.
They wrote:
The production of weapons of mass destruction has always been associated
with economic "waste." The term is pejorative, since it implies a
failure of function. But no human activity can properly be considered
wasteful if it achieves its contextual objective...
In the case of military "waste," there is indeed a larger social utility... In advanced modern democratic societies, the war system... has served as
the last great safeguard against the elimination of necessary social
classes.
As economic productivity increases to a level further and further
above that of minimum subsistence, it becomes more and more difficult for a
society to maintain distribution patterns insuring the existence of "hewers
of wood and drawers of water."...
The arbitrary nature of war expenditures and of other military activities
make them ideally suited to control these essential class relationships...
The continuance of the war system must be assured, if for no other reason,
among others, than to preserve whatever quality and degree of poverty a
society requires as an incentive, as well as to maintain the stability of
its internal organization of power. 1
1. Lewin, Report, pp. 34-35,40-41.
These documents from the real past and the imagined future £an help us to
better understand our present.
The spectacle of wasteful government
spending suddenly becomes logical. It is not [stupidity that pays farmers to
destroy their crops, or that purchases trillion-dollar weapons systems that
are never deployed or in some cases not even completed, or that provides
funding for studies of the sex life of the tse-tse fly, or that gives grants
to pornographers posing as artists.
The overriding object behind most of
these Boondoggles is to waste the resources of the nation. It is obvious by
now that the decline in living standards in the Western world is Associated
with a widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. What is not so
obvious, however, is that this is according to plan.
To that end, massive
waste in government spending is not an unfortunate by-product, it is the
goal.
That brings us back to the question of finding an acceptable substitute for
war. War is not only the ultimate waste, it is also the ultimate motivation
for human action. As Orwell said, waste in the absence of war "would provide
only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society."
Will the environmental-pollution model be able to sufficiently motivate
human action to be a substitute for war?
That is not a safe assumption. The possibility of war in our future cannot
be ruled out. The environmental-pollution model is pot yet thoroughly
proven. It is working well for limited purposes and on a limited scale, but
it is still doubtful that it will ever equal the hysteria potential of a
physical war.
The world planners will not abandon
the use of war until the new model has been proven over many years. On that
point, the Report from Iron Mountain was emphatic:
When asked how best to prepare for the advent of peace, we must first reply,
as strongly as we can, that the war system cannot responsibly be allowed to
disappear until,
1) we know exactly what it is we plan to put in its place
2) we are certain, beyond reasonable doubt, that these substitute
institutions will serve their purposes in terms of the survival and
stability of society...
It is uncertain, at this time, whether peace will
ever be possible. It is far more questionable... that it would be desirable
even if it were demonstrably attainable. 1
1. Ibid., pp. 88-90.
REGIONALISM AS A TRANSITION TO WORLD GOVERNMENT
The coalescing of the world's nations into three regional superstates was
already visible even before we activated our time machine.
The first steps
had been strictly economic but were soon followed by political and military
consolidation. The European Union (EU), including Russia, began with the
issuance of a common money and eventually merged into a functional regional
government. It was Orwell's Eurasia, even though it avoided calling itself
by that name.
Treaties binding Canada, the United States, Mexico, and South
America formed the basic outline of Oceania, built around the
Federal-Reserve Note as the regional money.
Japan eventually became hostile
to the West when trading was no longer to her sole advantage and, along with
China which had been built up by Western aid and technology, and with India
which had been given atomic technology by the West, became the political
center of Eastasia.
Even as far back as the 1980s, it was known as the
"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" Its monetary system was to be
based upon the Yen.
The people of the former nations were not yet ready for a giant leap into
world government. They had to be led to that goal by a series of shorter and
less frightening steps. They were more willing to surrender their economic
and military independence to regional groupings of people who were closer in
ethnic and cultural origin and who shared common borders.
Only after several
decades of transition was it possible to make the final merger. In the
meantime, the world was plunged alternately between war and peace. After
each cycle of war, the population was more frightened, impoverished, and
collectivized.
In the end, world government was irresistible. By that time,
the environmental-pollution model and the alien-invasion model had been
perfected to provide high levels of human motivation. But, even then,
regional uprisings were occasionally engineered when necessary to justify
massive "peacekeeping" operations.
War was never fully abandoned. It
remained, as it always had been, a necessity for the stabilization of
society.
HOW FIXED IS THE FUTURE?
Let us return now to the present from which we departed and reflect upon
our journey.
The first thing that strikes us is that we cannot be certain
the future will unfold exactly as we have seen it. There are too many
variables. When we originally set our Primary-Assumption selector to Present
trends unaltered, we left the Secondary-Assumption selector where it was. It
was pointing to Banking Crisis. Had we chosen the next position, no Banking
Crisis, our journey would have been different.
We would not have seen long
lines of Depositors or panic-buying in the stores or closing of the stock market. But we would still have witnessed the same scenes of despair in the
more distant future. We merely would have travelled a different path of
events to get there.
The forces driving our society into global totalitarianism would [not change
one iota. We still would have the doomsday mechanisms at work. We would have
the CFR in control of the power renters of government and the media. And we
would have an electorate which is unaware of what is being done to them and,
therefore, unable to resist.
Through environmental and economic treaties and
through military disarmament to the UN, we would witness the same emergence
of a world central bank, a world government, and a world army to enforce its
dictates. Inflation and wage/price controls would have progressed more or
less the same, driving consumer goods out of existence and men into bondage.
Instead of moving toward The New World Order in a series of economic spasms,
we merely would have travelled a less violent bath and arrived at exactly
the same destination.
There is little doubt that the master planners would prefer to follow the
more tranquil route. Patient gradualism is less risky. But not everything is
within their control. Events can get out of hand, and powerful economic
forces can become suddenly unleashed.
Banking crises can occur even without
being deliberately caused.
On the other hand, the Cabal also knows that crises are useful in driving
the masses into the corral faster than they would otherwise move.
Therefore,
the application of some kind of scientifically engineered crisis cannot be
ruled out. It could take many forms:
Ethnic violence, terrorism, plague,
even war itself.
But none of that makes any difference. It will not alter
our direction of travel through time. It will only determine our specific
route.
Like a flowing river, it may be diverted this way or that by natural
barriers or even by man-made channels, dikes, and dams, but it eventually
will reach the sea. Our concluding reflection, therefore, is that it is
relatively unimportant whether there will be a banking crisis or any other
cataclysmic event. These are all secondary assumptions which are
meaningless.
Our only real hope for averting the new feudalism of the future
is to change the Primary assumption.
We must change it to read: Present
Trends Reversed.
SUMMARY
A pessimistic scenario of future events includes a banking crisis, followed
by a government bailout and the eventual nationalization of all banks. The
final cost is staggering and is paid with money created by the Federal
Reserve.
It is passed on to the public in the form of inflation.
Further inflation is caused by the continual expansion of welfare programs,
socialized medicine, entitlement programs, and interest on the national
debt. The dollar is finally abandoned as the defacto currency of the world.
Trillions of dollars are sent back to the United States by foreign investors
to be converted as quickly as possible into tangible assets. That causes
even greater inflation than before. So massive is the inflationary pressure
that industry and commerce come to a halt. Barter becomes the means of
exchange. America takes her place among the depressed nations of South
America, Africa, and Asia - mired together in economic equality.
Politicians seize upon the opportunity and offer bold reforms. The reforms
are more of exactly what created the problem in the first place: expanded
governmental power, new regulatory agencies, and more restrictions on
freedom. But this time, the programs begin to take on an international
flavor. The American dollar is replaced by a new UN money, and the Federal
Reserve System becomes a branch operation of the IMF/World Bank.
Electronic transfers gradually replace cash and checking accounts. This
permits UN agencies to monitor the financial activities of every person.
A
machine-readable ID card is used for that purpose. If an individual is red
flagged by any government agency, the card does not clear, and he is cut off
from all economic transactions and travel. It is the ultimate control.
Increasing violence in the streets from revolutionary movements and ethnic
clashes provide an excuse for martial law. The public is happy to see UN
soldiers checking ID cards. The police-state arrives in the name of public
safety.
Eventually all private dwellings are taken over by the government as a
result of bailing out the home-mortgage industry.
Rental property is also
taken, as former landlords are unable to pay property taxes. People are
allowed to live in these dwellings at reasonable cost, or no cost at all. It
gradually becomes clear, however, that the government is now the owner of
all homes and apartments. People are living in them only at the pleasure of
the government. They can be reassigned at any time.
Wages and prices are controlled. Dissidents are placed into work armies.
There are no more autos except for the ruling elite. Public transportation
is provided for the masses, and those with limited skills live in government
housing within walking distance of their assigned jobs. Men have been
reduced to the level of serfs who are subservient to their masters.
Their
condition of life can only be described as high-tech feudalism.
There is no certainty that the future will unfold in exactly that manner,
because there are too many variables. For example, if we had assumed that
there will not be a banking crisis, then our journey would be different.
We
would not see long lines of depositors or panic-buying in the stores or
closing of the stock market. But we would still witness the same scenes of
despair in the more distant future.
We merely would have travelled a
different path of events to get there. That is because the forces driving
our society into global totalitarianism would not have changed one iota. We
still would have the doomsday mechanisms at work. We would have the CFR in
control of the power centers of
government and the media. We would have an electorate which is unaware of
what is being done to them and, therefore, unable to resist.
Through
environmental and economic treaties and through military disarmament to the
UN, we would witness the same emergence of a world central bank, a world
government, and a world army to enforce its dictates. Inflation and
wage/price controls would have progressed more or less the same, driving
consumer goods out of existence and men into bondage.
Instead of moving
toward The New World Order in a series of economic spasms, we merely would
have travelled a less violent path and arrived at exactly the same
destination.
Chapter Twenty-Six
A REALISTIC SCENARIO
What must be done if we are to avert the pessimistic scenario; a list of
specific measures that must be taken to stop the monetary binge; an appraisal
of how severe the economic hangover will be; a checklist for personal
survival - and beyond.
The pessimistic scenario presented in the previous chapter is the kind of
narrative that turns people off. No one wants to hear those things, even if
they are true - or we should say especially if they are true.
As Adlai
Stevenson said when he was a candidate for President:
"The contest between
agreeable fancy and disagreeable fact is unequal. Americans are suckers for
good news."
So, where is the optimistic scenario in which everything turns out all
right, in which prosperity is restored and freedom is preserved after all?
Actually, it is not hard to locate. You can find it [every day somewhere in
your newspaper. It is the shared faith of almost all politicians, experts,
and commentators. If that is what won want to hear, you have just wasted a
lot of time reading this book.
There is no optimistic scenario. Events have progressed too far for that.
Even if we begin to turn things around by forcing Congress to cut spending,
reduce the debt, and disentangle from UN treaties, the Cabal will not let go
without a ferocious fight.
When the Second Bank of the United States was
struggling for its life in 1834, Nicholas Biddle, who controlled it, set
about to cause as much havoc in the economy as possible and then to blame
it on president Jackson's anti-bank policies. By suddenly tightening credit
and withdrawing money from circulation, he triggered a full-scale national
depression.
At the height of his attack, he declared:
"All other banks and
all the merchants may break, but the
Bank of the United States shall not break."
The amount of devastation that
could be caused by today's Federal Reserve is infinitely greater than what
Biddle was able to unleash.
It would be pure self-deception to think that
the Cabal would quietly give up its power without exercising that option. We
must conclude that no one is going to get out of this one unscathed.
There
is hell to pay, and it is we who are going to pay it.
SEVENTH REASON TO ABOLISH THE FED
What has any of this to do with the Federal Reserve System? The answer is
that the Federal Reserve is the starting point of the pessimistic scenario.
The chain of events begins with fiat money created by a central bank, which
leads to government debt, which causes inflation, which destroys the
economy, which impoverishes the people, which provides an excuse for
increasing government power, which is an on-going process culminating in
totalitarianism.
Eliminate the Federal Reserve from this equation, and the
pessimistic scenario ceases to exist. That is the seventh and final reason
to abolish the Fed: It is an instrument of totalitarianism.
If the optimistic scenario is too optimistic and the pessimistic scenario is
too pessimistic, then what is the scenario that we should hope lies in our
future?
There is a middle course that lies between optimism and pessimism. It is
called realism. Calling it a realistic scenario is not meant to imply that
it is predetermined to happen, nor that it is even likely to happen.
It is
realistic only in the sense that it can happen if certain conditions are
met. The balance of this chapter will be devoted to an analysis of those
conditions.
Let us begin by allowing our opponent, Cynicism, to state the problem we
face:
"Is it realistic to believe that the current trends can actually be
reversed? Isn't it just fantasy to think that anything can be done at this
late date to break the CFR's hold over government, media, and education? Do
we really expect the gum-chewing public to go upstream against the
indoctrination of newspapers, magazines, television, and movies?"
Apathy joins in:
"Forget it. There's nothing you can do. The bankers and
politicians have all the money and all the power. The game is already over.
Make the most of it, and enjoy life while you can."
Do not listen to Cynicism and Apathy. They are agents of your enemy.
They
want you to quietly get in line and submit without a struggle. However, they
do make a point that must not be overlooked. The battle has progressed far,
and our position is not good. If we are to reverse the present trends, we
must be prepared to make a herculean effort.
That does not mean "Write your
Congressman" or "Vote on Tuesday" or "Sign a petition" or "Send in a
donation" That is far too easy. Those measures still play an important role
in the battle plan but they fall far short of the need. Armchair campaigns
will no longer do it.
Before turning to the question of what kind of effort will be required, let
us first be clear on what it is we want to accomplish.
WHAT MUST NOT BE DONE
Let us begin with the negatives: what must not be done.
The most obvious
item in this category is that we must not turn to government for more of the
same "cures" that have made us ill. We do not want more power granted to the
Fed or the Treasury or the President, nor do we need another government
agency. We probably don't even need any new laws, with the possible
exception of those legislative acts which repeal some of the old laws now on
the books.
Our goal is the reduction of government, not its expansion.
We do not want to merely abolish the Fed and turn over its Operation to the
Treasury. That is a popular proposal among those who know there is a
problem but who have not studied the history of central banking. It is a
recurrent theme of the Populist movement and those advocating what they call
Social Credit.
Their argument Is that the Federal Reserve is privately owned
and is independent of political control. Only Congress is authorized to
issue the [nation's money, not a group of private bankers. Let the Treasury
issue paper money and bank credit, they say, and we can have all the money
we need without having to pay one penny in interest to the bankers.
It is an appealing argument, but it contains serious flaws. First, the
concept that the Fed is privately owned is a legal fiction. The member banks
hold stock, but it carries no voting weight. No matter how large the bank or
how much capital is paid in, each bank has one vote. The stock cannot be
sold or traded.
Stockholders
have none of the usual elements of control that come with ownership and, in
fact, they are subservient to the central board. The seven members of the
Board of Governors are appointed by the President and confirmed by the
Senate. It is true that the Fed is independent of direct political control,
but it must never be forgotten that it was created by Congress and it can be
extinguished by Congress.
In truth, the Federal Reserve is neither an arm of
government nor is it private. It is a hybrid. It is an association of the
large commercial banks which has been granted special privileges by
Congress.
A more accurate description would be simply that it is a cartel
protected by federal law.
But the more important point is that it makes no difference whether the Fed
is government or private. Even if it were entirely private, merely turning
it over to the government would not alter its function.
The same people
undoubtedly would run it, and they would continue to create money for
political purposes.
The Bank of England is the granddaddy of central banks.
It was privately owned at its inception but became an official arm of the
British government in more recent times. It continues to operate as a
central bank, and nothing of substance has changed. The central banks of all
the other industrialized nations are direct arms of their respective
governments.
They are indistinguishable in function from the Federal
Reserve. The technicalities of structure and ownership are not as important
as function. Turning the Federal Reserve over to the Treasury without at the
same time denuding it of its function as a central bank - that is, its
ability to manipulate the money supply - would be a colossal waste of time.
The proposal of having the Treasury issue the nation's money is another
question and has nothing to do with who owns the Fed. There is nothing wrong
with the federal government Issuing money so long as it abides by the
Constitution and adheres to the principle of honesty. Both of these
restraints forbid Congress from issuing paper money that is not 100% backed
by gold or silver.
If you are in doubt about the reasoning behind that
statement, it would be a good idea to review chapter fifteen before
continuing.
It is true that, if Congress had the power to create as much money as it
needs without the Federal Reserve System, interest would not have to be paid
on the national debt. But the Fed holds only a small percentage of the debt.
Over 90% of those bonds are held by individuals and institutions in the
private sector.
Terminating interest payments would not hurt those big, bad
bankers nearly as much as it would the millions of people who would lose
their insurance policies, investments, and retirement plans. The Social
Credit scheme would wipe out the economy in one fell swoop.
And we still would not have solved the deeper problem. The bankers would be
cut out of the scam, but the politicians would remain Congress would now be
acting as its own central bank, the money supply would continue to expand,
inflation would continue to roar, and the nation would continue to die.
Besides, issuing money without gold or silver backing violates the
Constitution.
THE JFK RUMOR
In 1981, a rumor was circulated that President Kennedy had been assassinated
by agents of the hidden money power because he had signed
Executive Order
#11110 instructing the Treasury to print more than $4 billion in United
States Notes.
That is precisely the kind of money we are discussing: paper
bills without gold or silver backing issued by the government, not the
Federal Reserve. According to the rumor, the bankers were furious because
they would lose interest payments on the money supply. When the Order was
tracked down, however, it involved Silver Certificates, not United States
Notes.
Silver Certificates are backed by silver, which means they are real
money, so the rumor was wrong on that point. But there is no interest paid
on Silver Certificates either, so the rumor held up on that point. There was
a third point, however, which everyone seemed to overlook.
The Executive
Order did not instruct the Treasury to issue Silver Certificates. It merely
authorized it to do so.
There is no evidence that this was ever done. If the
Certificates were printed at all, they never found their way into
circulation. In 1987, the order was rescinded by President Reagan.
The Treasury did print a small supply of United States Notes in 1963, but
these were authorized by an 1878 act of Congress to replace Civil War
Greenbacks which had been retired from circulation. JFK did not initiate
that issue. The greatest quantity of those Notes to be in circulation since
their last printing in 1969 was $322 million - not a significant figure
compared to Federal Reserve Notes. Most of them are now collectors' items.
The persistent rumor regarding the bankers' role in JFK's death was
reinforced by several books circulated in conservative circles.
They
contained an ominous passage from Kennedy's speech at Columbia University,
just ten days before his assassination. He is quoted as saying: "The high
office of President has been used to foment a plot to destroy the Americans'
freedom, and before I leave office I must inform the citizen of his
plight."1
However, when Columbia University was contacted to provide a
transcript of the speech, it was learned that Kennedy never spoke there -
neither ten days before his assassination nor at any other time!
Ronald
Whealan, head librarian at the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library in Boston,
provides this additional information:
"Ten days prior to the assassination
he was at the White House meeting with, among others, the ambassador to the
United States from Portugal."
It is possible that the President did make the remarks attributed to him on
a different date before a different audience.
Even so, it is a cryptic
message which could have several meanings. That he intended to expose the
Fed is the least likely of them all. Kennedy had been a life-long socialist
and internationalist. He had attended the Fabian London School of Economics;
participated in the destruction of the American money supply; and engineered
the transfer of American wealth to foreign nations.
There is little reason
to believe that he had suddenly "seen the light" and was preparing to
reverse his life-long beliefs and commitments.
MONETARISTS VS. SUPPLY-SIDERS
But we are off the topic. Let us return to those unworkable theories
regarding monetary reform. Prominent in this category are the Monetarists
and the Supply-Siders.
The Monetarists, adhering to the theories of Milton
Friedman, believe that money should continue to be be created by the
Mandrake Mechanism of the Federal Reserve, but that the supply should be
determined by a strict formula established by Congress, not the Fed. The
Supply-siders, represented by Arthur Laffer and Charles Kadlec, believe in
formulas also, but they have a different one.
They want the quantity of
money to be determined by the current demand for gold.
They are not talking
about a true gold standard in which paper money is fully backed. By
following what they call a "gold-price rule," they would simply observe the
price of gold in the free market and then tinker with the dollar by
expanding or contracting the money supply to keep its relative value,
compared to gold, fairly constant.
These groups are alike in their underlying philosophy. Each has a different
goal and a different formula, but they agree on method: manipulation of the
money supply. They share the same conviction that the free market will not
work without assistance; the same faith in the wisdom and integrity of
politically-created formulas, bureaus, and agencies. The Fed remains
unscathed throughout all these debates because it is the ultimate mechanism
for intervention.
These people don't really want to change it. They just
want their turn at running it.
Occasionally a truly original proposal appears that captures one's
attention. Addressing a prestigious gathering of conservative monetary
theorists in 1989, Jerry Jordan suggested that the monetary base could be
expanded by holding a national lottery.
The government would pay out more
dollars in prize money than it received in ticket sales. The excess would
represent the amount by which the monetary base would expand. Presumably, if
they wanted to contract the money supply, they would pay out fewer dollars
than taken in.
It was an intriguing thought, but Mr. Jordan was quick to
add:
"The problem, of course, is that there would not be any effective
institutional restraint on the growth of the monetary base."1
Indeed, that
is the problem with all schemes involving monetary control by men.
BALANCED-BUDGET AMENDMENT
A so-called balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution is not the answer
either. In fact, it is an illusion and a fraud.
Some of the biggest spenders
in Congress are supporters. They know that it is popular with the voters but
would not cramp their spending style in the least. If they were not
permitted to spend more than they receive in taxes, they would have a
perfect excuse for raising taxes. It would be a way of punishing the voters
for placing limits on them.
The voters, on the other hand, would collapse
under the burden of higher taxes and demand that their Congressmen
circumvent the very amendment they previously supported. And that would be
easy. Most versions of the balanced-budget amendment have an escape hatch
built for just that purpose. Congress shall balance its budget "except in
cases of emergency."
Who decides what constitutes an emergency? Congress, of
course. In other words, Congress shall balance its budget except when it
doesn't want to. So what else is new?
A serious amendment would have to tackle, not balancing the budget, but
limiting the spending. If that were done, the budget would take care of
itself. But even that would be a waste of time considering the present
composition of Congress. Instead of generating political pressure for a
Constitutional amendment, we would be better off directing that same effort
toward throwing the big spenders out of office.
As long as the spenders are
allowed to stay in there, they will find a way to get around any law -
including the Constitution itself.
Another flaw in most versions of the balanced-budget amendment is that it
would not affect the off-budget expenditures called entitlements. They now
represent 52% of all federal outlays and are growing by 12% each year. A
strategy that ignores that back-breaking load is not worth even considering.
Furthermore, even if Congress could be forced to stop deficit spending, the
balanced-budget amendment would not solve the problem of inflation or paying
off the national debt.
The Federal Reserve can now inflate our money supply
by using literally any debt in the world. It does not have to come from
Congress. Unless we zero in on the Fed itself, we will just be playing
political games with no chance of winning.
Every year, a few concerned Congressmen submit a bill to investigate or
audit the Federal Reserve System. They are to be commended for their effort,
but the process has been an exercise in futility. Their bills receive little
or no publicity and never get out of committee for a vote.
Even if they did
receive serious attention, however, they could actually be
counterproductive.
On the surface, it would appear that there is nothing wrong with a
Congressional investigation or an audit, but what is there to investigate?
We must assume the Fed is doing exactly what it says and is in total
compliance with the law. A few minor improprieties probably would be
discovered involving personal abuse of funds for insider profiteering, but
that would be minor compared to the [gigantic fraud that already is out in
the open for all to see.
The federal Reserve is the world's largest and most
successful scam. Anyone who understands the nature of money can see that
without a team of investigators and auditors.
The danger in a proposal to audit the Fed is that it would Provide an excuse
to delay serious action for several years while the audit is going on. It
would give the public a false impression that Congress is doing something.
It also would give the monetary technicians an opportunity to lay down a
smoke screen of verbiage and confusing statistics.
The public would expect
that all the Answers will be forthcoming from the investigation, but the
very groups and combines that need to be investigated would be conducting,
or at least confounding, the investigation. By the time fourteen volumes of
testimony, charts, tables, and exhibits finally appear, the public would be
intimidated and fatigued.
The bottom line is that we do not need a bill to
audit the Fed.
We need one to abolish it.
A PLAN FOR ELIMINATING THE FED
So much for things not to do. Now let's get down to the Business at hand.
To
abolish the Federal Reserve System would be quite simple. All that would be
required is an act of Congress consisting of one sentence: The Federal
Reserve Act and all of its amendments are hereby rescinded.
But that would
wipe out our monetary system overnight and create such havoc in the economy
that it would play right into the hands of the globalists. They would use
the resulting chaos as evidence that such a move was a mistake, and the
American people would likely welcome a, rescue from the IMF/World Bank. We
would find ourselves back in the Pessimistic Scenario even though we had
done the right thing.
There are certain steps that must precede the abandonment of the Fed if we
are to have a safe passage.
The first step is to convert our present fiat
money into real money. That means we must create an entirely new money
supply which is 100% backed by precious metal - and we must do so within a
reasonably short period of lime.
To that end, we also must establish the
true value of our present fiat money so it can be exchanged for new money on
a realistic basis and phased out of circulation.
Here is how it can be
done:
-
Repeal the legal-tender laws. The federal government will
continue accepting Federal Reserve Notes in the payment of taxes, but
everyone else will be free to accept them, reject them, or discount them as
they wish. There is no need to force people to accept honest money. Only
fiat money needs the threat of imprisonment to back it up. Private
institutions should be free to innovate and to compete. If people want to
use Green Stamps or Disney-ride coupons or Bank-of-America Notes as a medium
of exchange, they should be free to do so. The only requirement should be
faithful fulfillment of contract. If the Green-Stamp company says it will
give a crystal lamp for seven books of stamps, then it should be compelled
to do so. Disney should be required to accept the coupon in exactly the
manner printed on the back. And, if Bank of America tells its depositors
they can have their dollars back any time they want, it should be required
to keep 100% backing (coins or Treasury Certificates) in its vault at all
times. In the transition to a new money, it is anticipated that the old
Federal Reserve Notes will continue to be widely used.
-
Freeze the present supply of Federal Reserve Notes, except for
what will he needed in step number eleven.
-
Define the "real" dollar in terms of precious-metal content,
preferably what it was in the past: 371.25 grains of silver. It could be
another weight of silver or even another metal, but the old silver dollar is
a proven winner.
-
Establish gold as an auxiliary monetary reserve which can be
substituted for silver, not at a fixed-price ratio, but at whatever ratio is
set by the free market. Fixed ratios always become unfair over time as the
prices of gold and silver drift relative to each other. Although gold may be
substituted for silver at this ratio, it is only silver that is the
foundation for the dollar.
-
Restore free coinage at the U.S. Mint and issue silver "dollars"
as well as gold "pieces." Both dollars and pieces will be defined by metal
content, but only corns with silver content can be called dollars,
half-dollars, quarter-dollars, or tenth-dollars (dimes). At first, these
coins will be derived only from metal brought into the Mint by private
parties. They must not be drawn from the Treasury's supply which is reserved
for use in step number six.
-
Pay off the national debt with Federal
Reserve Notes created for that purpose. Creating money without backing is
forbidden by the Constitution; however, when no one is forced by law to
accept Federal Reserve Notes as legal tender, they will no longer be the
official money of the United States. They will be merely a kind of
government script which no one is required to accept. Their utility will be
determined by their usefulness in payment of taxes and by the public's
anticipation of having them exchanged for real money at a later date. The
creation of Federal Reserve Notes, with the understanding that they are not
the official money of the United States, would therefore not be a violation
of the Constitution. In any event, the deed is already done. The decision to
redeem government bonds with Federal Reserve Notes is not ours. Congress
decided that long ago, and the course was set at tine instant those bonds
were issued. We are merely playing out the hand. The money will be created
for that purpose. Our only choice is when: now or later. If we allow the
bonds to stand, the national debt will be repudiated by inflation. The value
of the original dollars will gradually be reduced to zero while only the
interest remains. Everyone's purchasing power will be destroyed, and the
nation will die. But if we want not to repudiate the national debt and
decide to pay it off now, we will be released from the burden of interest
payments and, at the same time, prepare the way for a sound monetary system.
-
Pledge the government's hoard of gold and silver (except the military
stockpile) to be used as backing for all the Federal Reserve Notes in
circulation. The denationalization of these assets is long overdue. At
various times in recent history, it was illegal for Americans to own gold,
and their private holdings were confiscated. The amount which was taken
should be returned to the private sector as a matter of principle. The rest
of the gold supply also belongs to the people, because they paid for it
through taxes and inflation. The government has no use for gold or silver
except to support the money supply. The time has come to give it back to the
people and use it for that purpose.
-
Determine the weight of all the gold
and silver owned by the U.S. government and then calculate the total value
of that supply in terms of real (silver) dollars.
-
Determine the number of all the Federal Reserve Notes in
circulation and then calculate the real-dollar value of each one by dividing
the value of the precious metals by the number of Notes.
-
Retire all Federal Reserve Notes from circulation by offering to
exchange them for dollars at the calculated ratio. There will be enough gold
or silver to redeem every Federal Reserve Note in circulation.
-
Convert all contracts based on Federal Reserve Notes to dollars
using the same exchange ratio. That includes the contracts called mortgages
and government bonds. In that way, monetary values expressed within debt
obligations will be converted on the same basis and at the same time as
currency.
-
Issue Silver Certificates. As the Treasury redeems Federal Reserve Notes
for dollars, recipients will have the option of taking coins or Treasury
Certificates which are 100% backed. These Certificates will become the new
paper currency.
-
Abolish the Federal Reserve System. It would be possible to allow the
System to continue as a check clearing-house so long as it did not function
as a central bank. A check clearing-house will be needed, and the banks that
presently own the Fed should be allowed to continue performing that service.
However, they must no longer receive tax subsidies to operate, and
competition must be allowed. However, the Federal Reserve System, as
presently chartered by Congress, must be abolished.
-
Introduce free banking. Banks should be deregulated and, at the same
time, cut loose from protection at taxpayers' expense. No more bailouts. The
FDIC and other government "insurance" agencies should be phased out, and
their functions turned over to real insurance companies in the private
sector. Banks should be required to keep 100% reserves for demand deposits,
because that is a contractual obligation. All forms of time deposits should
be presented to the public exactly as CDs are today. In other words, the
depositor should be fully informed that his money is invested and he will
have to wait a specified time before he can have it back. Competition will
insure that those institutions that best serve their customers' needs will
prosper. Those that do not will fall by the wayside - without the need of an
army of bank regulators.
-
Reduce the size and scope of government No solution to our economic
problems is possible under socialism. It is the author's view that the
government should be limited to the protection of life, liberty, and
property - nothing more. That means the elimination of almost all of the
socialist-oriented programs that now infest the federal bureaucracy. If we
hope to retain - or perhaps to regain - our freedom, they simply have to go.
To that end, the federal government should sell all assets not directly
related to its primary function of protection; it should privately
sub-contract as many of its services as possible; and it should greatly
reduce and simplify its taxes.
-
Restore national independence. A similar restraint must be applied at
the international level. We must reverse all programs leading to disarmament
and economic interdependence. The most significant step in that direction
will be to Get us out of the UN and the UN out of the US, but that will be
just the beginning. There are hundreds of treaties and administrative
agreements that must be rescinded. There may be a few that are constructive
and mutually beneficial to us and other nations, but the great majority of
them will have to go. That is not because we are isolationist. It is simply
because we want to avoid being engulfed in global tyranny.
Some will say that paying off the national debt with Federal Reserve Notes
amounts to a repudiation of the debt.
Not so. Accepting the old Notes for
payment of taxes is not repudiation. Exchanging them for their appropriate
share of the nation's gold or silver is not repudiation.
Converting them
straight across to a sound money with little or no loss of purchasing power
is not repudiation. The only thing that would be repudiated is the old
monetary system, but that was designed to be repudiated. The monetary and
political scientists who created and sustained the Federal Reserve System
never intended to repay the national debt. It has been their ticket to
profit and power. Inflation is repudiation on the installment plan.
The
present system is a political trick, an accounting gimmick. We are merely
acknowledging what it is. We are simply refusing to pretend we don't
understand what they are doing to us.
We are refusing to play the game any
longer.
MEASURING THE SIZE OF THE HANGOVER
So those are the sixteen steps, but what are their effects? It should come
as no surprise that there is a price to pay for a return to monetary
sobriety.
A hangover cannot be avoided, except by continuing the binge,
which is the road to death. Let/s take a look at what this binge has already
cost us. We will measure that by calculating how much each Federal Reserve
Note will be worth when the new money appears.
The following figures are presented for illustrative purposes only. The data
are drawn from public sources and from the Federal Reserve itself, but there
is no way to know how accurate they really are. In addition to the question
of accuracy, there are some statistical items which are so obscure that not
even the experts at the Fed are certain what they mean.
When the time comes
to apply this program, it will be necessary to assemble a task force of
experts who can audit the books and assay the metals. Nevertheless, based on
the best information available to the public, this is what we get:
The total quantity of silver held by the government on September 30, 1993,
was 30,200,000 troy ounces. If we assume the new dollar will be defined as
371.25 grains of silver (which equals .77344 troy ounces), then that supply
is valued at $39,046,338.1
The price of gold on that date was 384.95 Federal-Reserve notes per ounce.
Silver was 4.99 fiat dollars per ounce. The ratio between them, therefore,
was 77-to-1.
The supply of gold was 261,900,000 ounces. The value of the gold supply,
therefore, (at 77 times its weight in ounces) was $26,073,517,000.
The value of silver and gold combined would be $26,112,563338.
The number of Federal-Reserve notes this supply would have to redeem would
be the combined total of the Ml money supply (currency and demand deposits)
plus the additional number of notes needed to pay off the national debt. Ml
on September 27, 1993, was 1,103,700,000,000 FRNs.2 The national debt stood
at 4,395,700,000,000 FRNs. The total amount to be redeemed, therefore, would
be 5,499,400,000,000 FRNs.
The bottom line of this calculation is that the value of each
Federal-Reserve note will be equal to .0047 silver dollar. One silver dollar
would be worth 213 Federal-Reserve notes!
1. Although the weight of the silver-dollar is 412.5 grains (.8594 troy
ounces), it is only 90% pure. Its silver content, however, is exactly 371.25
grains (.77344 troy ounces).
2. For those who feel that M2 or M3
would be a more logical figure, see "Is M1 Subtractive or Accumulative?" in
the Appendix, containing the author's notes and correspondence with the
Federal Reserve.
BAD, BUT NOT THAT BAD
That will be a bitter pill to swallow, but it sounds worse than it
really
is.
Remember that the new dollars will have more purchasing power than the
old. Coins will play a larger role in everyday transactions. The nickel
phone call and the ten-cent cigar will have returned. In the beginning at
least, the price of these items probably will be less than that.
As
explained in chapter seven, any quantity of gold or silver will work as the
foundation for a monetary system.
If the quantity is low - as certainly
will be the case at the time of transition - it merely means the value of
each unit of measure will be high. In that case, coins will solve the
problem. Pennies would be used for a cup of coffee; one mill (a tenth of a
cent) would pay for a phone call, and so on. New, small-denomination tokens
would fill that need.
In a relatively short period of time, however, the
monetary supply of gold and silver would increase in response lo free-market
demand. When the supply increases, the relative value will decrease until a
natural equilibrium is reached - as fedways has happened in the past. At
that point, the tokens will no longer be needed and can be phased out.
An inconvenience? Yes. Vending machines will have to be retrofitted for the
new coins, but that would be no more difficult than retrofitting them to
take paper bills or plastic debit cards, which is what will be required if
we do not adopt these measures. It is a small price to pay for an orderly
return to real money.
Another possible solution would be to redefine the new dollar to contain a
smaller quantity of silver.
The advantage would be that we could continue to
use our present coinage. On the negative side, however, is the fact that it
would create headaches after the transition, because coinage then would be
too cheap. Instead of changing over now, we would merely be postponing the
task for later. Now is the time to do it - and do it right. The original
value of a silver dollar was determined after centuries of trial and error.
We don't have to reinvent the wheel. We know that it will work in the long
run.
In the past, the banks have enjoyed a bountiful cash flow from interest on
money created out of nothing. That will change. They will have to make a
clear distinction between demand deposits and time deposits. Customers will
be informed that, if they want the privilege of receiving their money back
on demand, their deposit of coins or Treasury Certificates will be kept in
the vault and not loaned to others.
Therefore, it will not earn interest for
the bank. If the bank cannot make money on the deposit, then it must charge
the depositor a fee for safeguarding his money and for checking services. If
the customer wants to earn interest on his deposit, then he will be informed
that it will be invested or loaned out, in which case he cannot expect to
get it back any time he wants.
He will knowingly put his money into a time
deposit with the agreement that a specified amount of time must pass before
the investment matures.
The effect of this practice on banking will be enormous. Banks will have to
pay higher interest rates to attract investment capital. They will have to
trim their overhead expenses and eliminate some of the plush. Profit margins
will be tightened. Efficiency will improve. They used to offer "free"
services which actually were paid out of interest earned on their customers'
demand deposits.
Now they will charge for those services, such as checking
and safe storage of deposits. Customers probably will grumble at first at
having to pay for those things, and there will be no more free toasters.
Electronic transfer systems will probably become popular for their
convenience, but they will be optional. Cash and check transactions will
continue to play an important role. Government monitoring will be illegal.
Although there will be fewer dollars in circulation than there were Federal
Reserve Notes, the value of each one will be correspondingly greater. Each
person will end up with the same purchasing power he had before the
conversion.
For a short period, both the old and the new money will
circulate together, and some people will have difficulty making the
necessary calculations to determine their relative values. But that is a
routine operation for people who live in Europe or for anyone who travels to
a foreign country.
There is no reason to think that Americans are too stupid
to handle it.
SOME BAD NEWS AND SOME GOOD
We should not delude ourselves into thinking that this will be an easy
transition.
It will be a very difficult period, and people
will pave to get used to a whole new way of thinking and doing. The freeze
on the current money supply may trigger panic in the stock market and the business
community. Stock prices could tumble, causing paper fortunes to disappear
back into the computers from which they came.
Some businesses may fold for a
lack of easy credit. Weak banks will be allowed to close rather than be
bailed but with taxes. Unemployment may worsen for a while. Those who [have
been used to a free ride will now have to walk or push or pay their way. The
masses on welfare will not give up their checks and food stamps quietly. The
media will fan the flames of discontent. The Cabal will be at every switch
to derail the train.
This will be the moment of our greatest danger, the moment when the people
could tire of their hard journey in the desert and lose interest in the
promised land. This is the time when they may long for a return to captivity
and head back to the slave pits of Pharaoh.
The important point, however, is that most of these problems would be
temporary.
They would be present only during the period of transition to a
new money. As soon as free coinage is available at the Mint, and as soon as
people see how much demand there is for silver and gold coins, there will
be a steady stream of miners and jewelers who will add great new stores of
precious metal to the nation's monetary stock.
Foreigners undoubtedly will
add to the inflow. Old silver and gold coins will also reappear in the
market place. Very quickly, as the stores of precious metal respond to
supply and demand, the quantity of money will increase and its per-unit
value will drop to its natural equilibrium.
Won't that be inflation?
Yes it will, but it will be significantly different
from inflation by fiat money on four counts:
-
instead of being caused by
politicians and bankers attempting to manipulate the economy to enhance
their personal agendas, it will be caused by natural economic forces seeking
an equilibrium of supply and demand
-
instead of being harmful to the
nation, leading to the destruction of the economy, it will be part of a
healing process, leading to prosperity
-
it will be less severe than what
we will experience if we do not make the transition
-
instead of
being part of a continuum that is designed to go on forever, it will have a
built-in termination point: the point of natural equilibrium where the human
effort to mine gold and silver equals the effort to create those things
which gold and silver can buy
When that point is reached, the money supply
will cease to expand, and inflation will stop - once and for all.
The
hangover will be gone. From that point forward, prices will begin a gradual
descent as advances in technology allow improved efficiency in production.
With the arrival of lower prices, better job opportunities, and increasing
prosperity, the voices of discontent will gradually fade. After the storm is
over, America will have an honest money supply, a government with no
national debt, and an economy without inflation.
No matter what scenario unfolds in the future, there is white water ahead.
We had better tighten our straps and prepare for the rapids. We owe it to
ourselves and our families to take measures which will increase our chances
of coming out at the other side. If the pessimistic scenario is played out,
it will make little difference what we do, because there will be no other
side. But in the realistic scenario, there are certain precautions that will
make a big difference in our economic well being.
To fully appreciate the wisdom of some of these measures, it is well for us
to pause and consider the possibility that a transition to economic safety
and sanity will not be orderly. Another variant of the realistic scenario is
that our entire system could collapse, including the international structure
being assembled at the UN. If that should happen, we won't have to worry
about an orderly transition to a sound monetary system, because it won't
happen.
Our primary concern will be basic survival.
Economic chaos and civil disorder would not necessarily have to be the
prelude to world government. If a sufficient number of people were well
enough informed to know in advance what the enemy's game plan is, and
especially if they were in the right places within the system, they might be
able to provide leadership at the critical moment.
If there is blood in the
streets and long periods of anarchy, it is theoretically possible that
groups of enlightened individuals who have prepared in advance could move
into the power vacuum and take charge. That may sound like another
pessimistic scenario, but it is not. In the final analysis, it may be the
most realistic one of all.
But we should not hope for it.
All we can do is
prepare for it should it come to pass.
HOW TO PREPARE
What can we do to prepare financially? To avoid making this a lengthy
dissertation, let's use the outline form.
Elaboration should not be
necessary.
-
Get out of debt.
A mortgage on one's home is a logical exception, provided
the price is right. Borrowing for one's business is also an exception if
based on a sound business plan. Speculative investments are not a good idea
in these times unless they are made with money you can afford to lose.
-
Pick a sound bank.
Maintain accounts at several institutions. Do
not keep over $100,000 in any one bank. Remember that not all types of
accounts are covered by FDIC. Some institutions now offer private insurance.
Make sure you know to what extent you are at risk.
-
Diversify your investments,
...among blue ribbon, over-the-counter, growth, income, large, small, mutuals, bonds, real estate, bullion
coins, mining stock, and tangibles. Industries that do well in hard times
are gambling, alcohol, and escapist entertainment. Study the fields and
companies in which you invest. Personal knowledge is indispensable.
-
Avoid the most recent "best" performers.
Their great track records are
historical. They have no bearing on future performance. To the contrary,
they may now be overpriced and poised for a fall. See how an investment
fared over the long run - at least fifteen years - and particularly how it
performed during periods of economic downturn.
-
When investing in coins, avoid those with high numismatic
value,
...unless you are prepared to become an expert. As with other types of
investments, seek advice but don't depend on it. The same is true for
diamonds, art pieces, and other collectibles. Stay with what you know.
Otherwise, you will be vulnerable in shark-infested waters where even the
most experienced traders can lose money.
-
Maintain a stash of cash, including some old silver coins.
The
currency should be enough to provide your family with necessities for about
two months. The coins are for more severe and prolonged conditions. There is
no "correct" quantity. It is a matter of personal judgment and financial
ability.
PROFITING FROM DISASTER
All of this is aimed at surviving the storm and preparing ourselves to offer
leadership in troubled times ahead. That is a rather negative view.
There is
a more positive outlook for those who are looking for good news, as Adlai
Stevenson said. It is the exciting prospect that we can turn this calamity
to our advantage. We can actually profit from the coming collapse. That
thought has spawned hundreds of books and newsletters offering advice on how
to get rich while others are being destroyed. There is even one that gives
advice on how to cash in on the environmental-industry boom.
The pitch is
how to make a fortune on the downfall of America.
There is no doubt that opportunities exist to profit from investment
decisions based on a realistic appraisal of current trends. Most of those
opportunities, however, depend on making market-timing decisions. One must
know precisely when to buy, when to sell, and at what price.
To know all
that, the investor must become expert on the nature of the industries
involved and must monitor the daily shifts in market forces. He must attempt
to complete his analysis and reach his conclusions in advance of the crowd.
And, of course, he must be right Most investors are not prepared to do that,
so they must depend on the services of professionals, usually the same
experts who are encouraging them to invest in these kinds of enterprises. If
the investment is profitable, the analyst receives an income. If the
investment turns sour, the analyst still receives an income.
That relationship is not unique to the "profit-from-crash" group, however.
It is to be found at every level of the investment business as well as
within the legal and medical professions. The customer pays for the advice
regardless of its quality. What is disturbing about this investment concept
is that it actually may help to make matters worse.
By focusing on finding
clever ways to avoid the effects of inflation or of making a profit from it,
we are doing nothing to stop it and, thereby, encouraging its continuation.
Those who are gaining from inflation are not likely to offer serious
resistance to it.
As they watch their profits pile up, they may become its
most ardent supporters - even though they know deep in their hearts that it
will destroy them in the end.
There is nothing wrong with trying to preserve one's capital on the way
down, but the only real solution is to use one's capital to stop the present
trends. In the long run, there is no way to profit from a destroyed America.
There is no refuge from a collapse.
There is no way to protect your assets,
your home, your job, your family, your freedom.
As Henry Hazlitt phrased it,
"There is no safe hedge against inflation except to stop it".
AN EDUCATIONAL
CRUSADE
The best investment one can make at this time is to finance an educational
crusade.
Americans have allowed their nation to be stolen from right under
their noses because they did not understand what was happening. There is no
hope for the future as long as that condition remains. The starting point
for any realistic plan for survival and beyond is the awakening of America.
What does that entail?
These are the tasks:
-
Become self-informed.
That's not as easy as it sounds. It involves
a major commitment of time and money for books, recordings, and seminars.
Do it.
-
Become a pamphleteer.
Develop a mailing list of friends who
you think would be most receptive to learning more about these issues. Send
them something every month that is informative and not too long to read. See
the end of this chapter for information on how to obtain suitable
publications.
-
Join forces with others of like mind.
There is strength in
numbers. Three people acting alone are a force of three. When working
together, however, they multiply their efforts and equal a force of nine.
That is the power of organization. When choosing an organization, look for
experienced and principled leadership which has proven that it understands
the deeper issues and cannot be sidetracked by the Cabal.
-
Form an educational study group.
Give it an enticing name such
as The Reality Club or The Awareness Lunch Bunch. Make the meetings
interesting and short. Use local speakers, ask members to give book reviews,
show videos, have mock debates, throw parties. The goal is to reach new
people, not to preach to the choir.
-
Form ad-hoc committees, along with other like-minded friends,
to promote specific projects and programs.
Here are a few hypothetical
examples covering a range of issues: The Committee for Sound Money, Parents
for Better Education, Americans for Tax Relief, North-Bay Residents for
Private Property. That is an excellent way to bring pressure to bear on the
political structure and, at the same time, attract the support of new people
who share your common objective.
-
Expand your influence within the community.
People seldom
follow strangers. Become known and respected for your knowledge. Join groups
which are influential within your city or profession. Political groups are
particularly important, regardless of party. Volunteer for work and seek a
leadership role. Personally visit your city and county politicians and
maintain ongoing communication. Send them books, articles, baseball tickets
- anything to make sure they don't forget who you are. This is doubly
important for political candidates. If you have the talent and the aptitude,
consider running for some kind of public office yourself.
-
Use politics, don't be used by it.
We got into our present mess
through politics and we must get out the same way; but getting out is a lot
harder than getting in. The strategy, however, is simple: remove the
big-spending internationalists from office and replace them with men and
women dedicated to sound money and national independence. The way to remove
the spenders is to expose their voting records to their constituents, most
of whom have no idea how they vote on key issues. The way to get better
candidates elected is to volunteer to work in their campaigns. Work within
party organizations where possible but beware! Never allow loyalty to the
party to override loyalty to principle. Political parties are always
controlled from the top, and the major parties are controlled by the very
forces we must oppose. It is imperative that you and your candidate remain
independent of party control. Otherwise, your money and your effort
eventually will be used against you.
With that warning aside, we should be encouraged by the fact that the task
is not as overwhelming as it seems.
The power to reverse the present trend
rests in the hands of only 535 people. There are 435 Representatives and 100
Senators. To control a majority, all we have to do is influence the
election of 268 people. In reality, if we began to come even close to that
figure, we likely would see a wave of sudden political conversions among
those who remain in office.
It is possible that we could achieve our goal
by influencing the election in only 100 Congressional districts!
By using
the political freedom that yet remains in our system, we can Overthrow the
government of the United States every two years without firing a shot! But
we had better get going on it.
Time is running out.
CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY
We have finally come to the end of this book. It was not a textbook on
banking theory. It was a who-dunnit, and by now you know the answer.
We have covered a vast expanse of history and have wandered far afield from
our main topic. It was necessary. Without the larger view, the case against
the Federal Reserve System would have been "weak. It would have omitted the
elements of war, revolution, depression, and fraud.
Without that long
journey, we would be limited to a sterile discussion of interest rates,
discount policies, and reserve ratios. That is not where the body is hidden.
In the foreword, it was stated that there were seven reasons to abolish the
Federal Reserve System.
It is time to repeat them here:
-
It is incapable of accomplishing its stated objectives.
-
It is a cartel operating against the public interest.
-
It is the supreme instrument of usury.
-
It generates our most unfair tax.
-
It encourages war.
-
It destabilizes the economy.
-
It is an instrument of totalitarianism.
The purpose of this book has been to demonstrate the accuracy of those
assertions.
A plan for recovery was finally presented which involves sixteen steps, each
based upon lessons which emerged from history. These lessons were mingled
with a large amount of theory which is traceable only to the mind of the
author himself. Which is to say there is no guarantee the plan will work.
But it is a plan. It is better to fail trying than to do nothing. Like men
on a sinking ship, we must risk the water. We cannot stay where we are.
There undoubtedly are technical flaws in these proposals, for the mechanism
is merely a prototype. Someone surely will discover a gear that will not
mesh or a lever that is disconnected. It will need the additional work of
specialists in many diverse fields.
Even then, the job will not be complete,
for it must finally be handed over to those who are skilled in drafting
legislation.
Their task will be two-fold.
-
First, they must make it workable
in the real world of politics.
-
Secondly, they must prevent loopholes and
vagaries which could eventually subvert the plan.
But none of these considerations should deter us from beginning the process.
We may not have answers to all the technical questions, but we do have an
answer to the big question. We do know that the Federal Reserve System must
be abolished. Let us, therefore, begin.
The Creature has grown large and powerful since its conception on Jekyll
Island. It now roams across every continent and compels the masses to serve
it, feed it, obey it, worship it. If it is not slain, it will become our
eternal lord and master.
Can it be slain? Yes it can.
How will it be slain? By piercing it with a million lances of truth. Who
will slay it? A million crusaders with determination and courage.
The crusade has already begun.
