Irans New President Hassan Rouhani has
requested that Israel to sign and become a member of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as he spoke for a second time at the United
Nation General Assembly.
"As long as nuclear weapons exist, the threat of
their use exists," Rouhani said, citing the American bombings of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki in 1945.
Rouhani is calling for "nuclear-free zone" in the
Middle East.
Israel is the only country in the Middle East that had not and
will not sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Israel would use nuclear
weapons if it felt it was threatened by any nation in the Middle East.
The
nuclear capability of Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) defensive capabilities
just reached another plateau this past April. It purchased its 5th nuclear
submarine that can be deployed anywhere in the world with first strike
capability.
The Israel News Agency reported that Israel purchased a fifth
Dolphin class submarine called the "INS Rahav" from Germany. The article
headlined "Israel Launches Ninth Submarine, Ready To Strike Iran Nuclear
Weapons."
Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said,
"The submarines
are a strong, strategic tool for the IDF. The State of Israel is ready to
act anytime, anywhere - on land, sea and air - in order to ensure the
security of Israels citizens."
The submarines are equipped with
Israeli-designed Popeye missiles that are capable of carrying nuclear
warheads. It is no secret that Israel has nuclear weapons.
Some estimates
suggest that Israel has between 100 and 400 nuclear weapons. No one knows
exactly how many nuclear bombs Israel possesses, but we do know they have
the capability to produce them at a moments notice.
Mordechai Vanunu, a former Israeli technician at
the Dimona nuclear research
center in the Negev desert exposed Israels nuclear program to the world in
the 1986 Sunday Times (UK). Vanunu was kidnapped in Italy by Mossad agents
and brought to Israel to face an Israeli court. He was convicted and
imprisoned for more than 18 years at Shikma Prison in Ashkelon, Israel.
Half
of his prison term was in solitary confinement. He was eventually released
in 2004. Since then, Vanunu has been arrested and even imprisoned for
violating his parole. He was also arrested for trying to leave Israel at one
time.
Former Israeli Prime Minister and Noble 'Peace' Prize winner
Shimon
Peres said,
"he was a traitor to this country".
Since Israel is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Dimona Nuclear Research center is not subject to inspections from the
international community such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
According to the Federation of American Scientists in a 2007 report,
Israel
has between 75 and 400 nuclear warheads, but some estimates have their
nuclear warheads at less than 200.
It is also known that Israel has the
ability to deliver them by intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) with a
range of 5,500 kilometers or 3,400 miles, the Jericho III missile named
after the biblical city of Jericho, various aircrafts and of course
submarines.
The report stated the following:
By the late 1990s the U.S. Intelligence Community estimated that Israel
possessed between 75-130 weapons, based on production estimates.
The
stockpile would certainly include warheads for mobile Jericho-1 and
Jericho-2 missiles, as well as bombs for Israeli aircraft, and may include
other tactical nuclear weapons of various types. Some published estimates
even claimed that Israel might have as many as 400 nuclear weapons by the
late 1990s.
We believe these numbers are exaggerated, and that Israels
nuclear weapons inventory may include less than 100 nuclear weapons.
Stockpiled plutonium could be used to build additional weapons if so decided.
Israels nuclear program began after World War II. Israels first Prime
Minister David Ben-Gurion once said,
"What Einstein, Oppenheimer, and Teller,
the three of them are Jews, made for the United States, could also be done
by scientists in Israel, for their own people".
David Ben-Gurion wanted to
establish a Jewish State with a military force that would repel an attack by
any of its adversaries especially in the Arab world.
Ben-Gurions speech to
the elected assembly of Palestine Jews on October 2nd, 1947 made it clear on
the intentions of a new Jewish state:
Political developments have swept us on to a momentous parting of the ways -
from Mandate to independence.
Today, beyond our ceaseless work in
immigration, settlement and campaign, we are set three blazing tasks,
whereof fulfillment will condition our perpetuity: defense, a Jewish State
and Arab-Jewish Cupertino, in that order of importance and urgency.
Security is our chief problem. I do not minimize the virtue of statehood
even within something less than all the territory of the Land of Israel on
either bank of the Jordan; but security comes unarguably first. It dominated
our concerns since the Yishuv [Jewish community in Palestine] began from the
start of colonization we knew we must, in the main, guarantee it ourselves.
But recent upsets and upheavals in Palestine, in the Middle East and in the
wide world, and in British and international politics as well, magnify it
from a local problem of current safety into Zionisms hinge of destiny.
In
scope, in intensity, in purport, it is entirely different now. Just think of
the new factors that invest the problem with a political significance of
unprecedented gravity - and I could add a dozen others:
-
the anti-Zionist
policy pursued by the Mandatory Government during the past ten years
-
the
obliteration of European Jewry with the willing aid of the acknowledged
leader of the Palestine Arabs
-
the establishment of an Arab League active
and united only in combating Zionism
-
Bevins ugly war against the Jews
-
the
crisis in Britain and its political and economic aftermath, the creation of
armed forces in the neighboring States
-
the intrusion of the Arab Legion
And not a single Jewish unit exists.
We can stand up to any aggression launched from Palestine or its border, but
more in potential than yet in fact. The conversion from potential to actual
is now our major, blinding headache. It will mean the swiftest, widest
mobilization, here and abroad, of capacity to organize, of our resources in
economics and manpower, our science and technology, our civic sense.
It must
be an all-out effort, sparing no man.
Several months later on May 14th, 1948, the state of Israel became a reality
with David Ben-Gurion as its first Prime Minister.
Ben-Gurion, Executive
head of the World Zionist Organization in 1946 until 1956 and the head of
the influential Weizmann Institute of Science and Defense Ministry Scientist
Ernest David Bergmann recruited Jewish Scientists from abroad during the
1948 Arab-Israeli War.
Israel recruited and funded Jewish scientists to help
Israel establish a nuclear program.
By 1949, the Israel Defense Forces
Science Corps or Hemed Gimmel was in search of Uranium in the Negev
Desert, but only small amounts were discovered in phosphate deposits.
Hemed
Gimmel financed several students to study nuclear technology overseas. One
of the students attended the University of Chicago to study under Enrico
Fermi, who developed
the Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear reactor.
Fermi
also made scientific contributions to nuclear, quantum and particle physics
among others. By the late 1950s Shimon Peres had established LEKEM, or the
Science liaison Bureau a new intelligence service that would search for
technology, materials and equipment needed for Israels nuclear program.
By
1952, Hemed Gimmel was under Israels Ministry of Defense to become the
Division of Research and Infrastructure (EMET). By June 1952, The Israel
Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) was established with Ernest David Bergmann
as the first chairman. Hemed Gimmel was renamed Machon 4 which became the
"chief laboratory" of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC).
France was
a major partner for Israels nuclear program. France also sold weapons to
Israel.
The France-Israel relationship was instrumental in the development
of the Dimona Nuclear Research Center. Israel signed American President
Dwight Eisenhowers Atoms for Peace, an agreement for peaceful nuclear
cooperation between the U.S. and Israel along with Turkey to build a "small
swimming pool research reactor" at Nachal Soreq.
It was the first step to
building the Dimona nuclear research center in the Negev desert in
collaboration with France who faced political turmoil in its former colonies
in North Africa.
Israel also faced Arab hostilities in the Middle East, so
the cooperation on matters regarding new military technology complemented
each other. On March 20, 1957 a public signing ceremony to build a "small
swimming-pool research reactor" took place between France and Israel.
But
the reality was that France and Israel collaborated to build a larger
facility at Dimona.
In Israel and the Bomb by Avner Cohen, he describes
Ben Gurions ambitious plan regarding Israels nuclear program was advanced
through the Atoms for Peace Initiative:
With the return of Ben Gurion to power in 1955, nuclear energy became a
matter of national priority.
Ben Gurion gave political backing and financial
support to those in the Ministry of Defense who were committed to promoting
nuclear energy-Peres, Bergmann, Mardor, and the nuclear enthusiasts at
Machon 4.
There was also a change in the international climate concerning
nuclear energy, in the wake of Eisenhowers December 1953 Atoms-for-Peace
initiative.
Until then, nuclear energy in the United States, Canada, and
Britain, the three major countries dealing with nuclear energy, was largely
closed to other countries. The Atoms for Peace Initiative made nuclear
energy technology available to the rest of the world.
The United States under President Eisenhower allowed Israel to seek a
nuclear program that would advance its defense capabilities militarily.
By
1958, the construction of the Negev Nuclear Research Center located in the
Negev desert in secret through the
Protocol of Sèvres agreement. It was a
secret agreement between Israel, France and Great Britain at Sevres, France
to overthrow Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser through an invasion of
Egypt after Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal.
Four days after the Sèvres
meeting, Israeli forces invaded Egyptian territory.
French and British
forces invaded shortly after they vetoed a US sponsored UN Security Council
resolution under the guise that they would separate both Israeli and
Egyptian forces after Egypt refused their call to withdraw from the Suez
Canal.
In 1958, Charles de Gaulle became President of France.
Almost immediately
after he assumed office, he wanted to end Frances assistance to Israels
nuclear program. He would only support Israels nuclear program if
international inspectors were allowed to inspect Dimona and that Israel
would declare that its nuclear program was for peaceful purposes and that
under no circumstances reprocess plutonium.
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres negotiated with the French government allowing a window of opportunity
for French companies to continue its work until 1966 with the Israeli
government.
Israel also had declared its nuclear program was "peaceful".
BBC
News received secret documents that the British government also supported
Israels nuclear program by sending illegal and restricted materials that
started in the 1950′s. In 1961, the Ben-Gurion informed the Canadian
government that a pilot plutonium-separation plant would be built at the Dimona facility.
By 1962, the nuclear reactor at Dimona went "critical"
meaning a critical mass with a small amount of fissile material was needed
for a sustained nuclear chain reaction.
Shortly after, Israel secretly
acquired more than 90 tons of uranium oxide (yellowcake) from Argentina to
fuel the reactor. By 1965 the Israeli reprocessing plant was completed and
ready to convert the reactors fuel rods into weapons grade plutonium for a
nuclear bomb.
After the Six-Day War, Israel went live producing nuclear
weapons. A new era began in the Middle East. One that was a dangerous step
to a nuclear disaster if Israel decided to use its nuclear weapons against
an Arab country.
In Seymour M. Hershs The Samson Option: Israels Nuclear Arsenal and
American Foreign Policy stated the concerns Israels leaders had,
especially Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion if they did not obtain nuclear
weapons.
Hersh wrote:
"What is Israel?" he was quoted by an aide as asking "...Only a small
spot. One dot! How can it survive in this Arab world?"
Ben-Gurion believed
that he understood Arab character and was persuaded that as long as Arabs
thought they could destroy the Jewish state, there would be no peace and no
recognition of Israel.
Many Israelis, survivors of the Holocaust, came to
believe in ein brera, or "no alternative," the doctrine that Israel was
surrounded by implacable enemies and therefore had no choice but to strike
out. In their view, Hitler and Nasser were interchangeable.
For these Israelis, a nuclear arsenal was essential to the survival of the
state. In public speeches throughout the 1950s, Ben Gurion repeatedly linked
Israels security to its progress in science.
"Our security and independence
require that more young people devote themselves to science and research,
atomic and electronic research, research of solar energy... and the
like," he told the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, in November 1955.
Ernst Bergmann explicitly articulated the
ein brera fears in a letter two
years later:
"I am convinced... that the State of Israel needs a defense
research program of its own, so that we shall never again be as lambs led to
the slaughter."
Ben-Gurion, Shimon Peres, and Ernst Bergmann believed that Israels
independent arsenal finally could provide what President Eisenhower would
not - the nuclear umbrella.
Israels nuclear program was built on the belief that it had "no
alternative" but to build a nuclear weapon to deter Arab aggression.
Their
experience with
the 'Holocaust' justifies their intentions on maintaining
their nuclear weapons. Israels believes that another Holocaust can be
prevented, this time not from Germany but from Iran.
But many Israelis
during the development stages of nuclear weapons were not keen on obtaining
a nuclear bomb because of the Holocaust:
"Less compelling to the military men was the moral argument against the bomb
raised by some on the left and in academia: that the Jewish people, victims
of the Holocaust, had an obligation to prevent the degeneration of the
Arab-Israeli dispute into a war of mass destruction" Stated Hersh.
"Those
who held that view did not underestimate the danger of a conventional arms
race, but believed that, as Simha Flapan, their passionate spokesman, wrote,
'the qualitative advantages of Israel - social cohesion and organization,
education and technical skills, intelligence and moral incentive - can be
brought into play only in a conventional war fought by men'."
Another aspect of Israels foreign policy one should consider is the Samson
Option, a policy that calls for a retaliation using nuclear weapons against
an enemy who threatens the Jewish homeland of its existence.
Hersh explains:
Dimonas supporters had convinced most of the leadership that only nuclear
weapons could provide the absolute and final deterrent to the Arab threat,
and only nuclear weapons could convince the Arabs - who were bolstered by
rapidly growing Soviet economic and military aid - that they must renounce all
plans for military conquest of Israel and agree to a peace settlement.
With
a nuclear arsenal there would be no more Masadas in Israels history, a
reference to the decision of more than nine hundred Jewish defenders - known
as the Zealots - to commit suicide in A.D. 73 rather than endure defeat at the
hands of the Romans.
In its place, argued the nuclear advocates, would be the Samson Option.
Samson, according to the Bible, had been captured by the Philistines after a
bloody fight and put on display, with his eyes torn out, for public
entertainment in Dagons Temple in Gaza.
He asked God to give him back his
strength for the last time and cried out,
"Let my soul die with the
Philistines."
With that, he pushed apart the temple pillars, bringing down
the roof and killing himself and his enemies. For Israels nuclear
advocates, the Samson Option became another way of saying "Never again."
[In a 1976 essay in Commentary, Norman Podhoretz accurately summarized the
pronuclear argument in describing what Israel would do if abandoned by the
United States and overrun by Arabs:
"The Israelis would fight... with
conventional weapons for as long as they could, and if the tide were turning
decisively against them, and if help in the form of resupply from the United
States or any other guarantors were not forthcoming, it is safe to predict
that they would fight with nuclear weapons in the end...
It used to be
said that the Israelis had
a Masada complex... but if the Israelis are to
be understood in terms of a 'complex' involving suicide rather than
surrender and rooted in a relevant precedent of Jewish history, the example
of Samson, whose suicide brought about the destruction of his enemies,
would be more appropriate than Masada, where in committing suicide the
Zealots killed only themselves and took no Romans with them."
Podhoretz,
asked years later about his essay, said that his conclusions about the
Samson Option were just that - his conclusions, and not based on any specific
information from Israelis or anyone else about Israel's nuclear capability.]
In a White House press conference on May 18, 2009, US President
Barack
Obamas concern about,
"the potential pursuit of a nuclear weapon by Iran."
The United States and other Western nations have not announced any plans to
disarm Israels nuclear weapons but rather focused its attention on Irans
nuclear program.
Obama said,
"Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon would not only
be a threat to Israel and a threat to the United States, but would be
profoundly destabilizing in the international community as a whole and could
set off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East."
Israel already won the arms
race in the Middle East.
What is to stop Israels "Zealot" mentality from
using nuclear weapons in the Middle East? Israel has threatened Iran in the
past.
In a 2006 interview with Reuters former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres,
"the president of Iran should remember that Iran can also be wiped off
the map."
It was a response after a false claim Israel and its allies made
on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads comment in a 2005 speech at the
Ministry of Interior conference hall in Tehran called "The World without
Zionism" when he said Israel must be, "wiped off the map" which was
misinterpreted.
Earlier this year, former Prime Minister Ehud Barak said
that the US and Israel would take action against Iran,
"I dont see it as a
binary kind of situation: either they [the Iranians] turn nuclear or we have
a fully fledged war the size of the Iraqi war or even the war in
Afghanistan," Barak continued.
"What we basically say is that if worse comes
to worst, there should be a readiness and an ability to launch a surgical
operation that will delay them by a significant time frame and probably
convince them that it wont work because the world is determined to block
them."
Rouhani is seeking negotiations that would put Iran, the United
States and Israel on a path to a peaceful resolution.
One that will
recognize Irans right to a "peaceful" nuclear program for its country so
that they can export more oil and use the revenues it earned for the benefit
of the Iranian people. But do not expect any significant breakthrough
between Iran and the US/Israel alliance that seeks to dominate the Middle
East politically, economically and militarily.
The Obama administration is not seeking any negotiations with Iran unless
they stop its nuclear program which will not happen. Iran will insist that
they are signatories to the NPT and have an "inalienable right" to use
nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
Israel will not be a signatory to
the NPT because,
"This resolution is deeply flawed and hypocritical. It
ignores the realities of the Middle East and the real threats facing the
region and the entire world" according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
Another reason Israel will not sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty
is because they are victims of the Holocaust which is why they have violated
hundreds of U.N. Security Council resolutions and has used chemical weapons
on the Palestinians.
The talks between Iran and the US that will be held in
Geneva will fail come this October because the US wants to dominate Iran.
Iran has its principles it will stand by, but so will the US on Israels
behalf. The US and its staunch allies want Syria, Lebanon, the Gaza strip
and the West Bank and every nation on earth under their rule.
That is the
plan...
