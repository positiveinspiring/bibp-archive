-
"bringing peace [insert foreign country
here]"
This refers not to bringing any kind of meaningful peace to
a country that needs it. It simply means killing all enemies.
Without anyone to fight back, there is peace. For a psychopath,
peace means any and all opposition has been exterminated.
-
"bringing freedom to [insert foreign
country here]"
This refers not to any real freedoms, but merely
the psychopathic freedom to rape, pillage, and plunder a given group
of people. For a psychopath, freedom means doing whatever they hell
he wants to.
-
"protecting our freedoms"
A variation
of 2), this simply means protecting the right to rape, pillage,
plunder, etc.
-
"defending oneself" / "acting in
self-defense"
This refers not to any real type of defense, as a
result of an unprovoked attack. Self-defense means that a psychopath
has the right to maim, torture, terrorize, or kill anyone who
complains that he is already maiming, torturing, terrorizing, or
killing. For a psychopath, defending oneself means attacking blaming
the victim for the psychopath's own crimes, and holding them fully
accountable for actions that are the responsibility of the
psychopath.
-
"War on Terror"
The war on terror is a
war of terror. It is a war on the victims of terror at the hands of
psychopaths. When the victims of psychopathic terror respond, they
are attacked in the name of terror.
-
re: morality, e.g. "Jewish morality" or
"Israel's military is the most moral in the world"
When used in
the context of a psychopathic military, 'morality' refers to the
psychopathic morality of complete lack of conscience. For example,
feeling empathy for your enemy is "soft", "weak- or simple-minded".
Cold-blooded killing machines are moral soldiers, in the minds of pathocrats.
-
"Militant Islamo-fascism wants to take
over the world and install the law of Islam on the peoples of the
world"
This means that psychopaths, in fact, wish to take over the
world of normal people, installing the universal law of the
psychopath. This 'law' can manifest itself in any ideology, whether
it by capitalist, socialist, fascist, communist, Judaic, Talmudic,
Christian, Muslim, etc.
-
"support our troops"
The does not
refer to any real moral and empathic support for those sent to die
as cannon fodder. For a psychopath, "support" means sacrifice;
normal people, whether part of or foreign to the country of the pathocracy, must be killed. Wars are a perfect means to not only
kill a pathocracy's own citizens, but those of the 'enemy of the
day'.
-
"outrageous conspiracy theories"
This
refers to "probable conspiracy facts". As normal people generally
see the absurdity of such conspiracies as "heads of state being
shape-shifting reptiles" or "Elvis killed JFK" or "Jews are
responsible for everything bad in the world", by associating the
word 'outrageous' with completely plausible conspiracies, normal
people are hesitant to question.
-
"Anti-semitic"
A label which refers to
any behavior critical of the bloodthirsty Talmudic Zionist
war-machine in Israel that murders Palestinians every day by the
dozens.
-
"Self-hating Jew"
A Jew that displays
"anti-semitic" behavior but cannot have this label (libel?) applied
for obvious reasons.
-
"Globalization"
It's not about the
distribution of the marvelous wealth the capitalistic system has to
offer to the poorer countries, but another way or another excuse for
the big corporations and the wealthier nations to steal and plunder
the natural resources of those same poorer countries leaving the
native populations with nothing.
-
Free Trade
Multinational companies
spread this word as though it is about helping each of the countries
they wish to plunder. Another buzzword with no real meaning. This is
like globalization's little brother
-
Illegals
People who live in one part of
the world, who are from another part of the world, lacking the
required paperwork.
