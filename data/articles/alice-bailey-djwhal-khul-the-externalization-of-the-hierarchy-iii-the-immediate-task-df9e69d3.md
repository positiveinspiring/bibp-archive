Immediate Task

The Immediate TaskI enter upon my
concluding remarks wondering if anything I can say will awaken disciples to the needed
spiritual effort - a spiritual effort which must find expression in physical plane
decisions and activity. A certain aspect of physical plane effort is already being
undertaken by them through very force of circumstance: Red Cross activity in every land,
response to urgent, surrounding, physical need, and the mobilization of their time and
resources by leaders in all countries are the keynotes of the time. But it is the inner
spiritual activity and orientation (paralleling the outer activity) which is required.
This is an activity which is preceded by clear factual thinking and decision. Can the
world disciples and aspirants evidence this full life on all levels? Are they capable of
an intensive inner life as well as of unflagging attention to outer duty and demands? This
is the problem. Are they capable of laying aside their own pet theories and trifling
ideals (trifling in the face of the appalling world situation) and focus every possible
effort on fighting evil upon the physical plane, as well as on other levels, with every
possible agency? Can they at the same time live that dynamic life of thought and inclusive
comprehension which will find expression in the voiced appeal to the Avatar? It is feeling
and fanatical adherence to a loved ideal which frequently stand between a disciple and
effective service on the physical plane. It is old habits of [310] thought and the
determined effort to interpose some mystical dream between conditions as they are and
conditions as they could be, if disciples took right action, which have prevented
effective service.
But, my
brother, all things have to become new and that means a new vision, a new idealism, and a
new life technique. Past ideals, past dreams and past efforts to tread the Path and
express brotherhood have produced most successfully a certain changed attitude in the
race, a new orientation to the life of the spirit, and a focused intention to move
forward. That was the desired goal and that goal has now been reached.
The right attitude is now present in many people in every race, and it is the
recognition of this which has called forth the activity of the Brothers of the Shadow at
this time. They realize that the time of their power is shortening. The hold of the
materialistic values over man is steadily becoming weaker. So far has man progressed that
there are enough people in the world today to turn the tide if they can be
aroused from their apathy.
I tried to arouse them to speed and clear thinking between the years 1932-1938 but
though something was accomplished, it was not enough. The blindness, illusion,
separativeness and inertia of the aspirants of the world today constitute one of the
factors with which the Hierarchy has to contend. Aspirants are preoccupied with their own
little affairs and with their own small efforts, instead of relinquishing everything in an
endeavor to unite on the needed appeal and activity. They are contending for their own
interpretations of truth, and for their pet ideals of peace, living or work and - like
Nero - they "fiddle whilst Rome burns." All their lives they have fought for an
ideal and a dream, and they love that more than they love humanity. Yet - all that is
needed is such a deep love of humanity that it works out on all levels of activity and all
life effort. If the idealists of the world would realize the situation as it is,
they would relinquish all that they hold dear and come to the rescue of humanity, and thus
snatch the helpless masses back from [311] slavery and death. They would battle for the
freedom of the human soul with every weapon in the armory of mankind. They would hold back
the forces of aggression by force itself if need be. They would aim at clear thinking, and
thus clear the channel for the inflow of spiritual force. The major prerequisites today
for true world service are an overwhelming love of humanity and a sense of proportion. The
only requirements today for disciples and aspirants may be summed up as follows:
