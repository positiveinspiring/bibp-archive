A single death is a tragedy, a
million deaths is a statistic.
Joseph Stalin
In earlier times it was easier to control a million people than
physically to kill a million people. Today it is infinitely
easier to kill a million people than to control a million
people.
Zbigniew Brzezinski
Zbigniew Brzezinski
Many people believe that governments are too
bureaucratic, incompetent and lazy to accomplish anything substantial.
However, history has demonstrated that powerful elites have used governments
to do one thing extremely efficiently:
Democide.
According to Professor R.J. Rummel of the University of Hawaii,
Democide is the murder of any person or people by a government, including
genocide, politicide, and mass murder. Democide does not include soldiers
killed in battle.
During the 20th Century (1900s)
alone, Rummel calculates that government power was used to murder
approximately 262,000,000 people (262 millions.)
Soviet Union
Approximately 61,911,000 people, 54,769,000 of them citizens, were murdered
by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1917 to 1987.
Rummel writes:
Part of this mass killing was genocide, as
in the wholesale murder of hundreds of thousands of Don Cossacks in
1919, the intentional starving of about 5,000,000 Ukrainian peasants to
death in 1932-33,2 or the deportation to mass death of 50,000 to 60,000
Estonians in 1949.
Part was mass murder, as of the wholesale
extermination of perhaps 6,500,000 "kulaks" (in effect, the better off
peasants and those resisting collectivization) from 1930 to 1937, the
execution of perhaps a million Party members in the Great Terror of
1937-38, and the massacre of all Trotskyites in the forced labor camps.
Most people are unaware that all that death
resulting from the Bolshevik Revolution would not have been possible absent
the support of wealthy financiers in London and New York.
Lenin and Trotsky
were on the closest of terms with these moneyed interests both before and
after the Revolution.
Additionally, it was President Woodrow Wilson
that provided Trotsky with a passport to return to Russia to "carry forward"
the revolution.
China
Political power grows out of the barrel
of a gun.
Mao Zedong
Whatever the price of the Chinese Revolution [40 million people
murdered], it has obviously succeeded not only in producing more
efficient and dedicated administration, but also in fostering high
morale and community of purpose.
The social experiment in China
under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and
successful in human history.
David Rockefeller
(CFR,
Trilateral Commission,
Bilderberg, Chase Bank)
Since 1949 the Chinese communists killed from
5,999,000 to 102,671,000 people; a prudent estimate is 35,236,000.
When
added to the number they murdered in previous years, the communists likely
killed 38,702,000 Chinese, Tibetans, and other minorities.
No other people in the last century except Soviet citizens have suffered so
much mass killing in cold blood as have the Chinese.
In 1972, then National Security Adviser
Henry Kissinger
and President
Richard Nixon had no problem meeting with Mao, after Maos Great Leap
Forward, which banned private property and resulted in the murder/starvation
of millions of Chinese.
This meeting improved U.S. Chinese relations so
that U.S. economy could later be destroyed by outsourcing manufacturing to
communist China.
Nazi Germany
Nazi Germany was a ruthlessly efficient killing machine from 1933 to 1945.
By genocide, the murder of hostages, reprisal raids, forced labor,
"euthanasia," starvation, exposure, medical experiments, and terror bombing,
and in the concentration and death camps, the Nazis murdered from 15,003,000
to 31,595,000 people, most likely 20,946,000 men, women, handicapped, aged,
sick, prisoners of war, forced laborers, camp inmates, critics, homosexuals,
Jews, Slavs, Serbs, Germans, Czechs, Italians, Poles, French, Ukrainians,
and many others.
Among them 1,000,000 were children under
eighteen years of age. And none of these monstrous figures even include
civilian and military combat or war-deaths.
Of course, the Nazis did not lose the war, only the German people lost the
war. The Nazis simply relocated to the United States under
Operation
Paperclip and South America (Grey Wolf).
It is important to realize that Hitlers rise to power was made possible by
Wall Street banksters and American industrialist.
Anthony Suttons
Wall
Street and the Rise of Hitler demonstrates that the Nazis
received support from Henry Ford, General Electric, ITT, Texaco, Wall Street
houses - Dillon, Read; Harris, Forbes, Morgan and Chase banks, and banker
Paul Warburg (co-founder of the private Federal Reserve),
Standard Oil's [Rockefeller] role was technical aid to Nazi development of
synthetic rubber and gasoline through a U.S. research company under the
management control of Standard Oil.
The Ethyl Gasoline Company, jointly owned by
Standard Oil of New Jersey and General Motors, was instrumental in supplying
vital ethyl lead to Nazi Germany - over the written protests of the U.S. War
Department - with the clear knowledge that the ethyl lead was for Nazi
military purposes.
Prescott Bush also helped Hitlers rise to power. George W. Bush's
grandfather, the late US senator Prescott Bush, was a director and
shareholder of companies that profited from their involvement with the
financial backers of Nazi Germany.
A financial firm of which Prescott Bush
was a director was involved with the financial architects of Nazism.
His business dealings, which continued until his
company's assets were seized in 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy Act,
led more than 60 years later to a civil action for damages being brought in
Germany against
the Bush family by two former slave laborers at Auschwitz.
Vietnam and Southeast
Asia
U.S. policy toward the third world
should be one of depopulation
Henry Kissinger
(CFR,
Trilateral Commission,
Bilderberg)
Professor Rummel calculates that at least
3,761,000 people were murdered by governments in Southeast Asia from 1945 to
1987. This period includes U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.
According to James Bo Gritz, Americas most decorated Green Beret
commander, U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War served three purposes for the
international planners.
Most significant was the genocide in Southeast
Asia, through a policy of drawn-out, no-win warfare which resulted in the
combat deaths of more than 58,000 Americans and more than six million
Vietnamese, Laotians, and Cambodians.
This policy permitted the collapse of the Lon
Nol military government in Cambodia (Kampuchea) in order to make way for
Pol
Pot, who oversaw the slaughter of nearly half his countrymen.
Cambodia
Professor Rummel notes that in proportion to its population, Cambodia
underwent a human catastrophe unparalleled in this century.
Out of a 1970 population of probably near
7,100,000 Cambodia probably lost slightly less than 4,000,000 people to war,
rebellion, man-made famine, genocide, politicide, and mass murder.
The vast
majority, almost 3,300,000 men, women, and children were murdered within the
years 1970 to 1980 by successive governments and guerrilla groups.
Most of
these, a figure near 2,400,000, were murdered by the communist Khmer Rouge
as directed by Pol Pot.
Unfortunately, Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge also received support from the
United States:
Two U.S. relief aid workers, Linda Mason and
Roger Brown, later wrote,
'The U.S. government insisted that the
Khmer Rouge be fed. The U.S. preferred that the Khmer Rouge
operation benefit from the credibility of an internationally known
relief operation.'
In 1980, under U.S. pressure, the World Food
Program handed over food worth $12 million to pass on to the Khmer
Rouge.
In that year, I traveled on a U.N. convoy of
forty trucks into Cambodia from Thailand and filmed a U.N. official handing
the supplies over to a Khmer Rouge general, Nam Phan, known to Western aid
officials as The Butcher.
Iraq Democide
After providing weapons to both Iraq and Iran during the Iran/Iraq War, the
United States and UN world governments were used by their globalist
controllers to conduct democide against the people of Iraq.
On May 12, 1996, former Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright told 60 minutes that murdering 500,000 Iraqi children by
imposing economic sanctions was worth it.
Former
private Federal Reserve syndicate boss Alan Greenspan said that the
U.S. invasion of Iraq caused the deaths of 1,200,000 Iraqis and was about
stealing oil.
In fact, many Iraq war veterans, which get no attention from the Big 6
military/pharmaceutical/industrial complex media, say that the Iraq War is
one long atrocity.
The U.S. military also used depleted uranium against the Iraqi people, which
ensures generations of birth defects and disease due to a half-life of 4.7
billion years.
United States
Soft-Kill Democide
In their quest for death and depopulation, the globalists are currently
conducting soft-kill democide.
Obamas top science adviser, John P. Holdren, co-authored Ecoscience,
in which he advocated the formation of a planetary regime that would use a
global police force to enforce totalitarian measures of population
control, including forced abortions, mass sterilization programs conducted
via the food and water supply, as well as mandatory bodily implants that
would prevent couples from having children.
Maurice Hilleman, one of the most prominent vaccine scientists in the
history of
the vaccine industry, a Merck scientist, made a recording where
he openly admits the vaccines given to Americans were contaminated with
leukemia and cancer viruses. Now one in three Americans will suffer and/or
die from cancer.
Bill Gates is also and advocate of
using vaccines to reduce the population and eugenics.
At a TED conference, he announced in front of a
live audience:
"...if we do a really great job on new
vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower
[global population] by perhaps 10 or 15 percent."
Additionally, Gates holds 500,000 shares of
Monsanto which poisons the population and environment with GMO crops.
Fortunately for Gates, he has plenty of money to
pay the presstitutes to propagandize him as
a saint.
-
Aluminum is used in many household
products, including personal deodorant, despite the fact that it
promotes cancer.
-
Chemtrails are sprayed from planes
above, poisoning the population with aluminum, strontium, and
barium. There have even been reports that chemtrails contain the
SV-40 cancer virus.
-
Our food has been genetically modified,
packed with preservatives, and filled with toxic dyes and chemicals
to the point that it is a secret soft-kill weapon.
-
Our tap water has been contaminated with
toxic fluoride, an ingredient in bug poison that harms teeth, the
body and mind.
All of these contaminates cause cancer, disease,
or continually stress the immune system to the point that we live shorter
lives.
United States Democide
Build-up
An abundance of evidence suggests that the globalists are planning democide
for the United States.
Congress and Obama passed
the unconstitutional NDAA,
telling Americans that they no longer have any rights and can be detained
indefinitely and tortured without due process.
The planned American democide appears to be modeled after General Pinochets
reign of terror, where 40,000 political prisoners were detained and
thousands of others simply disappeared. Pinochets reign of terror was
made possible after he came to rule Chile through a CIA sponsored coup.
In the United States, government whistleblowers have recently stepped
forward with documents proving that
FEMA detention (concentration) camps are
being activated.
Additionally, a
FEMA camp rendition site was discovered at
Los Angeles International Airport the week after military training exercises
occurred, reminiscent of Operation Urban Warrior.
Conclusion on Democide
Professor Rummel has demonstrated that power kills.
The greater the state power, the less the
freedom of its subjects; and the greater the state power, the greater the
democide. In short, the greater the freedom people have in terms of their
rights and control over the state, the less killing - democide, war,
revolution - will occur.
Rummel concludes that to stop democide we must promote freedom.
How to Stop Democide
and Defeat the New World Order
The most important step to stopping democide is refusing to hurt anyone with
the exception of legitimate self-defense.
That means not being deceived into supporting
violence or war due to
false flag operations like 9/11 and the Gulf of
Tonkin incident.
Educate others that the president and most members of congress are nothing
more than puppets for the real acting government. Expose the globalists
agenda. In fact, even the mainstream media now admits that the nations
leading politicians are from the same bloodline.
Dont buy shares of stock in defense (war and death) contractors, the
Fortune 500, GMO food companies, mutual funds that may own them, or large
banks that provide funding. Refuse to do business with these companies.
Remove your kids from public school gulags where they are trained to conform
and obey orders like Pavlovs dogs. Teach them your values, provide diverse
experiences and apprenticeships, and show them by example how to act as a
responsible adult.
Enjoy the beauty and miracle of life no matter what the globalists do -
refuse to feel the fear and anger that they work so hard to instill. Refuse
to violate your conscience.
Love even your willfully ignorant neighbors.
