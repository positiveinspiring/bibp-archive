What is Globalization?
It is the collective effect of purposeful and
amoral manipulation that seeks to centralize economic, political,
technological and societal forces in order to accrue maximum profit and
political power to
global banks, global corporations and
the elitists who
run them.
"Free Trade" is the central mantra. Globalization is set against national
Sovereignty, closed borders, trade tariffs and anything that would restrict
its goals and methods used to achieve them.
Globalization promotes regional and global government, a one-world economic
system of trade and a form of fascism where global corporations and their
elite control the policies and directives of individual governments.
The original and primary perpetrators of modern-day globalization number
only in the 100's, representative of which, but not exclusively, are
members of The Trilateral Commission.
To understand the genesis of the Trilateral Commission, read the
transcript of the
1979 radio show between Antony C. Sutton, Patrick M.
Wood and George S. Franklin, Jr. - Coordinator of the Trilateral Commission!
Where did
Globalization come from?
The "New International Economic Order" was the
coinage of the Trilateral Commission starting in 1973. This purpose was
stated repeatedly in its papers, journals and conferences.
In 1991, President
George H.W. Bush, a member of the
Trilateral Commission, began to openly talk about the
New
World Order, which expanded the concept to include governance as
well as economic unity.

words!
