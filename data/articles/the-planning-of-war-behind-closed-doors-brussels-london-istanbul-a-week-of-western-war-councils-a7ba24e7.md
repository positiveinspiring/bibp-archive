The defense chiefs of all 28 NATO nations and an
undisclosed number of counterparts from non-Alliance partners gathered in
Istanbul, Turkey on February 4 to begin two days of meetings focused on the
war in Afghanistan, the withdrawal of military forces from Kosovo in the
course of transferring control of security operations to the breakaway
province's embryonic army (the Kosovo Security Force) and,
"the transformation efforts required to best
conduct the full range of NATOs agreed missions." [1]
Istanbul was the site of the bloc's 2004 summit
which accounted for the largest expansion in its 60-year history - seven new
Eastern European nations - and its strengthening military partnerships with
thirteen Middle Eastern and African nations under the Istanbul Cooperation
Initiative.
-
The Chairman of the NATO Military
Committee, Admiral Giampaolo Di Paola
-
NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe
Admiral James Stavridis
-
The top commander of all U.S. and NATO
troops in Afghanistan - soon to reach over 150,000 - General Stanley
McChrystal,
...are also in attendance, as are European Union
High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton
and United Nations High Representative for Afghanistan Kai Eide as well as
the defense and interior ministers of Afghanistan.
The meetings follow by a week the International
Conference on Afghanistan held in London, which in turn occurred the day
after two days of meetings of the NATO Military Committee with the Chiefs of
Defense of the military bloc's 28 member states and 35 more from what were
described as Troop Contributing Nations; presumably NATO partner nations
with troops stationed in the Afghan war theater.
In all, the military chiefs of 63 countries.
The U.S.'s McChrystal was present there also as were Israeli Chief of
General Staff Lieutenant General Gabi Ashkenazi and Pakistani Chief
of Army Staff General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.
Beforehand the bloc's website reported that,
"The various meetings will focus on the
progress made in ongoing operations and the New Strategic Concept for
NATO." [2]
That 35 top military commanders from non-NATO
countries were present to hear plans for the escalation of what is already
the largest war in the world is understandable, as their forces are on the
ground as part of a 50-nation plus force under NATO military command.
That the same conference discussed the bloc's 21st century new global
military doctrine - former U.S. secretary of state Madeleine Albright
delivered an address on the topic - raises the question of how many of the
35 partner states' military chiefs may have joined their 28 NATO colleagues
for that phase of discussions.
That such a high percentage of the world's
leading military commanders attended a two-day affair which deliberated on
both the war in South Asia and the expansion of the world's only military
bloc's activities even further outside the Euro-Atlantic area (when it has
already conducted operations in four continents) confirms that the Afghan
war serves more than one purpose for the West.
It is the laboratory for strengthening military
ties with nations on every inhabited continent and for building the nucleus
of and foundation for a potential future world army.
The London conference on Afghanistan, presented in the West as a benign
undertaking tantamount to an economic development or humanitarian aid
planning event - the conference's website described it as,
"The international community [coming]
together to fully align military and civilian resources behind an
Afghan-led political strategy," [3]
...was preceded by two days of meetings between
top military commanders of almost a third of the world's nations at NATO
headquarters and followed by two days of meetings by NATO and allied defense
chiefs this week.
Many of the same people - EU foreign policy
chief Baroness Ashton and the UN's Eide (who formerly occupied
comparable posts in Bosnia and Kosovo and was Norway's ambassador to NATO
from 2002 to 2006) - attended both the London conference and are attending
the Istanbul NATO defense ministers conclave.
(Ashton's predecessor's Javier Solana was Secretary General of NATO from
1995 to 1999 before becoming the EU's High Representative for Common Foreign
and Security Policy - the title slightly adjusted after the Lisbon Treaty -
from 1999 until December of 2009, effecting the transition seamlessly.)
By way of reciprocity, the London conference was addressed by NATO Secretary
General Anders Fogh Rasmussen who said, inter alia,
"with more than 85,000 troops from 44
nations deployed to Afghanistan and with over 39,000 additional forces
arriving over the coming weeks and months - the NATO-led International
Security Assistance Force remains NATOs top priority." [4]
If any further evidence was required that the
United Nations is at the service of NATO and not vice versa, that the EU is
NATO's civilian valet de chambre, and that all three are subordinated
to the United States, the last week's events and the roster of attendees at
them should suffice.
The chain of command begins in Washington and orders barked out there work
their way down to Brussels and New York City.
The two organizations based in the Belgium capital,
-
the "military alliance of democratic
states in Europe and North America" (NATO's self-definition)
-
the "European military superstate"
(Irish opposition parties' reference to the effects of the Nice and
Lisbon treaties),
...are afflicted with political echolalia,
parroting the U.S. position on conflicts armed and with the potential to
become so around the world,
..and all those to come - with truly impressive
fidelity in this otherwise inconsistent age.
Condemnations, tirades and threats issued by the U.S. secretary of state and
ambassador to the
United Nations
may as well be presented in triplicate.
Permanent Security Council members Russia and China may occasionally - all
too occasionally - block hostile Western actions against defenseless third
parties in the United Nations, but Washington always walks away with a
mandate and the final say in the selection of viceroys to complement U.S.
and NATO military forces on the ground in subjugated nations.
As a recent example, during the second day of the NATO Military Committee
meetings in Brussels and the day before the Afghan conference in London, an
"international" conference on Yemen was also held in London which,
"Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown
called for... in response to the failed
bomb attack on an airliner over
Detroit on December 25." [5]
That bears repeating.
The apprehension in the U.S. of a Nigerian
national alleged to have been trained in Yemen led the head of state of the
United Kingdom to summon representatives of,
-
the Group of Eight (Britain, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the U.S.)
-
the Gulf Cooperation Council (Bahrain,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates)
-
Egypt
-
Jordan - but not the Arab League
-
Turkey
-
the European Union
-
United Nations
-
World Bank
-
International Monetary Fund,
..."to bolster Yemen's fight against al
Qaeda...." [6]
Soon 50,000 non-American NATO troops will be
bogged down in Afghanistan because the bloc invoked its Article 5 collective
defense provision in 2001... to fight against al-Qaeda.
Ever-compliant United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
lent legitimacy to this American and British charade, as he did the
following day's Afghan conference where he delivered a speech in the
presence of 28 NATO and perhaps dozens of its International Security
Assistance Force non-member states foreign ministers.
Yemen has joined the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq as a target for
Western "assistance and stabilization." NATO will conduct more planning
sessions with scores of military chiefs and defense and foreign ministers
and not only for the war in Afghanistan.
Its new Strategic Concept knows no geographical bounds.
