# Is it Wise for Obama to Send Thousands of U.S. Troops into The Ebola 
Death Zone?

When there is a major problem somewhere in the
world,
Barack Obama loves to show that he is "doing something" by sending a
contingent of U.S. troops to the affected area.
The UN already has
6,000 uniformed peacekeepers in the region, and they are not doing much
good. The truth is that this is a medical crisis that requires medical
personnel.
By sending thousands of troops into the heart of the Ebola
pandemic, we make it much more likely that Ebola will be brought back to the
United States.
Obama should keep in mind that
hundreds of health workers have become infected even though they wear
protective gear and are trained to deal with Ebola patients. Our troops have
not been trained to deal with Ebola patients and they probably will not be
wearing full protective gear when dealing with the general population.
But there are sick people among the general
population that could pass Ebola to them.
It is absolutely imperative that we keep Ebola
isolated to the areas that it is already affecting. The number of Ebola
victims
has doubled over the past month, and there are computer models that are
projecting that
'millions' of people could soon be sick if the virus continues to spread
at this pace.
Putting medically untrained troops directly into
the death zone seems like a very questionable thing to do. If a single one
of them gets sick and brings the virus back home, it could turn out to be
one of the most foolish things that Obama has ever done.
On Tuesday, Obama visited the CDC and finally
admitted that this Ebola outbreak is "spiraling
out of control" and that strong action needed
to be taken immediately
President Obama stressed his sense of
urgency on Tuesday at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
warning that as America scurries to help west African nations grapple
with the deadly Ebola epidemic, 'We can't dawdle on this one.'
Of course this is something that he should have
done a month or two ago, but at least he is finally stepping up to the
plate.
However, Obama continues to insist that the
chance of an Ebola outbreak happening in the United States is "extremely
low"
'Our experts here at the CDC and across our
government agree that the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the
United States are extremely low,' Obama declared.
But he described a battery of new
biosecurity measures, including toughened airport screening and a
growing capacity for lab testing, that will help 'in the unlikely event
that someone with Ebola does reach our shores.'
He better be right about that.
One thing that Obama has correctly identified is
the need to build a lot more treatment facilities for Ebola in the affected
regions.
Right now, all of the existing facilities are
completely full and there
are no empty beds left
Countless taxis filled with families worried
they've become infected with Ebola currently crisscross Monrovia in
search of help.
They scour the Liberian capital, but not one
clinic can take them in for treatment.
"Today, there is not one single bed
available for the treatment of an Ebola patient in the entire
country of Liberia," said Margaret Chan (...yes, 'the'
Margaret Chan from 'old'...), the World Health
Organization's director-general.
"As soon as a new Ebola treatment
facility is opened, it immediately fills to overflowing with
patients," the WHO said.
Obama's plan calls for building 17 new Ebola
treatment facilities with approximately 100 beds each.
Needless to say, that is not going to get the
job done. 1700 beds is going to be kind of like spitting into Niagara Falls
if we actually do see
hundreds of thousands of cases in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea by
early next year.
But should we give Obama credit for trying to do
something about this crisis even though he has waited far too long and his
plan is not well thought out?
I am not so sure.
Meanwhile, the WHO said this week that the Ebola
outbreak continues to grow "exponentially"
and that a billion dollars may be needed to bring it under control.
And one U.S. health official told the U.S.
Senate
on Tuesday that if Ebola continues to spread like wildfire that we could
be "dealing with it for years to come"
"If we do not act now to stop Ebola, we
could be dealing with it for years to come," said Beth Bell,
director of the national center for emerging and zoonotic infectious
diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
At a Senate hearing on Ebola, she noted that
100 CDC staff are working in West Africa and hundreds more are assisting
from Atlanta.
"The best way to protect the U.S. is to
stop the outbreak in West Africa."
Most Americans still do not seem too concerned
about this virus.
But this is not the bird flu. This is a disease
that is killing more than half the people that it infects.
Dr. Kent Brantly, one of the American doctors
that contracted the virus but eventually recovered, says that this is a
crisis that
we need to be taking very seriously
"From the time I fell sick, just two months
ago, the death toll has tripled," Brantly said, noting World Health
Organization estimates of 5,000 cases, with about half of those patients
dying from the virus.
"In nine months down the road, we are
looking at hundreds of thousands, not just in cases, but deaths."
