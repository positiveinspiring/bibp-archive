What is truth?
Not a simple question.
-
Is it as
you feel it to be? (Subjective truth)
-
Is it based on what you perceive to
be facts, uninfluenced by your feelings? (Objective truth)
-
Is it only what your five senses
confirm to be real? (Empirical truth)
Even within these three very basic concepts of
truth, there rests a plethora of subtleties upon the definition of truth -
correspondence, coherence, constructivist, consensus, and many more.
It is
within these subtleties we find a foundational dichotomy between the truth
of Mainstream Media (MSM) and the truth of the Alternative Press
(Alt. P).
Within the varying theories on truth, the MSM (as the faces, voices and
words of the global elite cartel) embrace two of the weakest theories, the
first being consensus theory.
Consensus theory holds that truth is whatever is
agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some
specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a subset
thereof consisting of more than one person.
1
A prime example of this is found in a statement
by Joseph Goebbels; chillingly insightful, coming from a Nazi.
If you tell a lie big enough and keep
repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be
maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from
the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie.
It thus becomes vitally important for the
State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the
mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the
greatest enemy of the state.
Another truth subset found in the MSM, acting as
an extension of globalist shapers over the centuries, is constructivist
truth theory.
Social constructivism holds that truth is
constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific,
and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a
community.
Constructivism views all of our knowledge as "constructed,"
because it does not reflect any external "transcendent" realities (as a pure
correspondence theory might hold).
Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed
as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience.2
This theory is evidenced most notably in school
books from K - PhD., and can best be expressed in the saying "History is
written by the victors". This is why we were taught Columbus discovered
America, and not the Vikings, hundreds of years prior; reams of historical
data notwithstanding.
Social constructivist truth reigns supreme in history
and social science departments of most major universities, stamping out
clones to perpetuate the dissemination of falsities to coming generations of
scholars and students, and so on and so on.
Discovery and The History Channel
are two of the
worst television perpetrators of this truth theory.
Over generations, we
accept certain things as true, simply because we have heard it our entire
lives from various sources - but who actually says anything happened
a particular way?
We watch a Network show, (fictionally) called "Bin Laden - the Life and
Times". It would consists of the constructivist theory of truth, as it
embraces previously published documents and testimony, vetted, in support of
the constructivist lie being built, (they are a brick in this wall).
The more firmly the lie takes root in our
collective psyche, the greater chance becomes that this original lie will
become a consensus truth. It is in this fashion we accept so much.
The alternative press, however, embraces distinctly different truth
theorems. The primary theory employed by the alternative press, by
necessity, is empirical truth.
If MSM is Goliath, the Alt. P. is David.
Being the underdog in this dichotomy, it is
incumbent upon the Alt. P. to provide this form of proof, as what is
being posited on Alt. P sites (the key word here being alternative [to the
accepted, or prevalent norm]) is in direct contravention to the consensus
theory of truth, which reigns supreme in North America at this moment in
time.
To use the phrase again, "History is written by the victors", with MSM
representing the victors (at this point in time); if we hold a pair of
sevens in black jack, then they are sitting on a pair of kings.
The MSM has
the power system in place to foist blatant falsehoods on the public, beating
it into our heads 24/7 via CNN, FOX, etc.
The Alt. P.
has the Internet, which is a mighty,
mighty tool. One can paint with a broad swath in stating that television is
the realm of deception and the Internet is the realm of truth. (The brush is
very wide).
It is therefore unremarkable to understand that,
for the most part, almost every single television network and channel can
ultimately be traced through corporate threads to be in the holding and
control of only five global media conglomerates.
5
It is chilling to realize that ultimately, (very
simplistically stated) five corporate chairmen decide what the world
will see, hear about and read about. Anything different from this consensus
truth construct is relegated to the alternative media.
The Internet, while still being a creature of the US military,* has morphed
beyond their control, having grown into a truth spewing beast they can no
longer contain, short of complete destruction of same.
This is not out of the realm of reason.
*
There is strong support in both camps that the military either did or did
not create the Internet. Whether
Berners-Lee or
Arpanet genius sparked the
concept of the Internet, it stands to logic (for funding reasons, for the
enormous scope of authoritative geographical cooperation required of such an
infrastructure, and the simple fact such a marvelous capacity for both
weapons evolution and social programming and monitoring capabilities could
breathe life), that government involvement is almost unavoidably certain.
When one considers, as did Goebbels, that,
"
a lie can be maintained only for such time
as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or
military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for
the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is
the mortal enemy of the lie".
If the Internet is the primary means of
disseminating the truth, it is by proximity a mortal enemy of the
globalists, as they are the primary espouser of lies. And of course, one
realizes when one says globalists one is also saying military.
At the end of the day, if one wants a person to believe a newly presented
truth, in their heart, one must offer that person empirical truth -
sensory evidence . . . video, pictures, credible testimonials, contravening
documentation from the very parties being sought to divorce them from.
Nothing else will work.
Anything less is a seed planted in rocky soil.
Doubt
flourishes for lack of evidence.
This conception of empirical truth (physical
evidence) was, after all, a cornerstone in a U.S. Court of Law criminal
trial, though for a different America than we know today.
The Alt. P. also embraces the correspondence theory of truth; not as
demanding as empirical truth, but a younger sibling to be sure. The
correspondence theory of truth states that the truth or falsity of a
statement is determined only by how it relates to the world and whether it
accurately describes (i.e., corresponds with) that world.
The theory is opposed to the coherence theory of
truth (a mainstay of MSM
news programs especially so), which holds that the
truth or falsity of a statement is determined by its relations to other
statements rather than its relation to the world.
3
Mass spectrometer readings of melted beams of the twin towers indicating
the
presence of thermite, with said publishing by reputable, credible,
non-government scientists,
4
that do so at peril, is empirical evidence.
Science is a cornerstone of empirical evidence.
One must logically acknowledge forthcoming scientists stand to gain nothing
beyond complacency of soul, and stand to lose much in social and
professional standing. One cans aught but conclude there is but one goal in
their presentation of facts contrary to the consensus theory of truth
espoused by the MSM, and that is to make known the truth of empirical,
irrefutable truth.
One may find the reports themselves suspect, (as
ultimately, anyone can, at any time, suspect the truth of anything), but one
cannot deny the career jeopardy these scientists place themselves in,
and (will hopefully) examine the scientists premise for action.
Ayn Rand, vilified and praised with equal fervor, wrote, "Check your
premises". Good advice, in relation to this topic. We must examine the
agendas of the parties as relates to the content of the news or media
content promulgated.
MSM, through the tentacle that is Hollywood, promotes the consensual truth
that Satanism is vogue,
6
that casual sex is mentally healthy, that men are bumbling fools
while women are empowered; stronger mentally, morally and logically. In the
entertainment industry, Satanism is epidemic. To be rattled by oodles of
empirical evidence go
here.
A recent single episode of Two and Half Men included references and
jokes alluding to threesomes, incestuous threesomes, drug use, alcohol abuse
and very casual sexual trysts. (I had better hopes for you, Ashton).
Ah, just another evening on prime time network
family entertainment. No cultural manipulation going on here! No Sir!
Remember please that the primary target audience for the pervasive
Luciferian references
10 is young children, and the
younger the better. Its called indoctrination.
One must understand, and
realize for and when your children do not, a simple truism, phrased
here in the form of a question.
"If we embrace the concept of empirical
evidence; what we see and here, in other words, then is it not highly
probable; inevitable, even, that if an impressionable child
(impressionability being the yeast of formative mental and emotional
growth in every human child ever born) is inundated daily with satanic
images and physical manifestations (in the form of concerts, music
awards, etc.) of devil worship, vulgar displays of wanton promiscuity,
8
satanic symbols and mentally divergent themes and song lyrics, that
they will embrace, to greater and lesser degrees, the essence of that
evil agenda?"
It is not the symbols themselves, but the moral
decay which the performances and symbols endorse and promote. This is
the danger.
The premise, or foundational reason for this Hollywood agenda is to
erode the family unit. They have done a marvelous job of it. The US is a
world leader in divorce rates.
A destroyed family (and does a divorce do
nothing else if not destroy the family?) acerbates the division of the
family unit, and with the loss of the family unit, a populace is that much
easier to control, lacking the strength of conviction that only a nuclear
family unit can inspire the average Joe to heroic acts of defense.
The broken man, bitter woman, disenfranchised
and neglected child... what will they fight for at risk of life? Beyond the
animal defense instinct that kicks in for everyone faced with immediate
death, most rudderless citizens will sweep to the oars of a globalists
controlled current.
The tame elder brother to Hollywoods insidious evil, but a brother
nonetheless, is network news, and their lesser viewed cousins found in cable
news. One can logically concede that the big five media heads are safely
in the realm of the globalist elite; each being a Minister of Propaganda
rendering a Goebbels to the skill level of a small market slickster.
If one here can concede there is a globalists
cabal with a specific agenda of global domination, then one must also agree
there are those standing in opposition to such designs. You probably agree,
shills withstanding. To accomplish the foul deeds required to see global
domination realized, a few eggs must be cracked.
A summation of agreement in a room of global elites,
"These actions must be covered up, lest the
masses realize what we are up to!"
Enter the big five, in unison,
"No problem. Well have Miley strip to near
nude and crotch hump a dude on national television
Syria? Wheres that?"
Problem solved
for now.
On a scale of 1-100, Google tracks the search interest of certain terms.
After Miley Cyrus' performance, her Google rating went from 67 to 100 in
less than 24 hours, while "Syria" went from 4 to 3 during the same period.
Rerunning the numbers Thursday, CP found Cyrus' Monday rating 100, with
Syria down at 2. On Tuesday, Miley went down to 63, but Syria remained less
than one tenth of that, at 6.
9
That is a reason, a premise for her needlessly crude performance.
Remember, the globalists machine is vast and all-encompassing; meshing
governments, MSM, weapons, energy and food
essentially every aspect of our
existence.
Hence, the alternative press employs analysis and construction of the truth,
based on empirical evidence, because there is no other form of truth as
powerful.
This is why the truth movement is growing daily
and the globalists employed inferior forms of constructive and consensus
truth are crumbling in the face of empirical truth, and that is why
we will triumph when all is said and done.
And thats the truth!
