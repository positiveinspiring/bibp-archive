The German government is now fully committed to escalating its ongoing
counterattack against international financial speculation.
These moves represent an historical watershed as
Germany becomes the first major economic power to roll back the tide of
financial globalization, under which crackdowns on hedge funds, derivatives,
and the world gambling casino were branded as taboo for national
governments.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch채uble has announced that
the Merkel government is sending a draft bill to the German parliament (the
Bundestag) targeting "turbulence" and "volatility" through further
regulation of "certain transactions [which] amplify the crisis."
The bill reaffirms the most fundamental German
measure enacted so far, the May 18 blanket ban on all naked credit default
swaps issued against the treasury bonds of the Eurozone nations.
This ban represents the most aggressive move
anywhere in
the OECD against these most toxic
derivatives, which have
figured prominently in the AIG bankruptcy and the recent Goldman Sachs
Abacus scandal. They are also the derivatives being widely used by hedge
fund hyenas and zombie banks to attack such nations as Greece, Spain, and
the rest of the Southern tier of the Euro.
The naked
CDS ban protects Euroland government bonds.
To that would now be
added a ban on the naked shorting of those Euro zone government bonds
themselves. This means that a speculator wishing to sell a Euro zone
government bond short must own that bond in advance. This makes speculation
more complex and expensive, and is all to the good.
Sch채uble's new measures also expand protection for certain stocks and for
the Euro itself. The draft bill would outlaw naked shorts of all German
stocks, meaning stocks whose primary listing is at a German exchange. The
original May 18 package had banned naked shorts against a list of 10 large
German banks, insurance companies, and reinsurance firms.
The obvious next
step is to ban naked shorting of stocks altogether. From now on, speculators
who wish to short German stocks must own those stocks before they sell,
making it more difficult and costly for said speculators to operate. The new
draft bill would also outlaw the naked shorting of the Euro itself in the
foreign exchange markets.
The Bundestag needs to approve this bill on the
fast track, and then do more.
Tiny Tim Geithner's US Treasury is attempting, but not succeeding, to
conceal its apoplectic hysteria over the German ban. Geithner announced that
he was flying from China to Europe in order to confer with George Osborne,
the new
Bilderberger Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Bank of England boss
Mervyn King in London, followed by consultations with European Central Bank
chief Trichet and Bundesbank leader Axel Weber in Frankfurt, followed then
by a meeting with Sch채uble in Berlin.
There was no doubt that the overriding
purpose of Geithner's mission was to sabotage the German moves against
derivatives in particular and speculation in general.
An unnamed US Treasury official speaking off the record on condition of
anonymity told Dow Jones that the German ban on naked credit default swaps
was "damaging to the market and counterproductive."
The band was
"one-sided," he added, making clear that Geithner & Co. did not expect the
German ban to be adopted on a large scale. Geithner was evidently deeply
concerned that the German ban might be imitated by some of Germany's
closest economic partners, including the Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden, as well as by other nations much farther afield.
Who was the anonymous
official? It might have been Tiny Tim himself, or it might have been
Mark
Patterson of Goldman Sachs, Geithner's chief of staff and chief lobbyist for
carbon offset boondoggles.
Spain is an example of a country which would have been very well advised to
join in the German measures when they were first proposed. Observers have
noted with some astonishment that the self-styled "socialist" Zapatero of
Madrid is unable or unwilling to embrace the measures against the casino
economy which the center-right Christian Democratic/Liberal government in
Berlin is actively pursuing.
The explanation is obviously that the Socialist
International as a whole (with figures like Papandreou of Greece and
Socrates of Portugal, as well as Zapatero) is acting as an abject
puppet of
the financiers.
Spain is now paying the price for its inaction through an incipient banking
panic emerging on the weekend after the German ban was announced. The Caja
Sur, a savings bank representing about 1% of the Spanish banking system,
became insolvent, quickly followed by eight banks over the next three days.
This meant that the
hedge funds had succeeded in spreading the Greek
contagion, thus raising questions about the short-term survivability of such
overextended speculative operations as Banco Santander and Banco de Bilbao.
The Spanish parliament approved a draconian austerity program by a single
vote, offering the lunatic spectacle of a country already mired deeply in
economic depression, with an official unemployment rate of 20%, embracing
its own self-cannibalization with a deflationary austerity program in the
vain effort to regain the confidence of international financial markets and
investors.
Spain needs to understand that there are no "markets" today, but
only oligopolies and cartels. They need to understand that they are dealing
with ruthless speculators, and not with investors. They might as well try to
regain the confidence of Bonnie and Clyde, Dillinger, and Ma Barker.
Another country that urgently needs to join the anti-derivatives front is
Italy, where a large-scale debate on economic populism broke out on the
weekend after the German ban.
The financiers Franco DeBenedetti and Paolo
Savona, camouflaged amidst a group of free-market quackademics, are
desperately campaigning to convince Prime Minister Berlusconi to maintain
the sanctity of hedge funds and derivatives. My answer to these market
fetishists appears below.
Berlusconi is moving in the wrong direction on
draconian austerity with the 30 billion package of cuts which he has
presented to the parliament. If this is all Berlusconi has to offer, the
Italian economy is in danger of entering a death spiral in which tax
increases and cuts to spending and public services inevitably cause rising
unemployment, falling real production, and constantly lower government
revenue receipts.
Berlusconi should concentrate on suppressing speculation
and on launching a recovery program, not on austerity.
Reactionary commentators around the world continue to parrot the line that
the great crisis is a crisis of the "welfare state," and spells the doom of
any and all government measures designed to defend and secure the health,
education, and welfare of their respective populations.
The Greeks, we are
told, are "profligate."
This legend of the profligate Greeks conveniently
ignores the fact that Greece is the second poorest nation of pre-1990 Europe
only Portugal is poorer. The Greeks have 18% official unemployment, with
20% of the population living below the official poverty line. The average
Greek office worker earns about $1500 per month, or barely 40% of the wage
level of their German counterparts. And the average pension for Greek
government worker is about $750 per month. This is hardly a king's ransom.
Greece is also an example of one of the peripheral countries where the
depression first began to hit. Greece is heavily dependent on tourist
revenue, which began to decline sharply in 2007 and 2008 as the world
derivatives panic began to lash Germany and northern Europe, spelling fewer
foreign visitors on the Acropolis and on Mykonos and the Dodecanese .
The pro-financier ideologue Robert Mundell, speaking in Warsaw, has voiced
his evaluation that a restructuring of Greek government debt is now
inevitable. The Greeks and many others would be well advised to act on this
advice immediately.
For many of these countries, it is already obvious that
their current debts cannot be repaid in the physical universe as presently
constituted. For them, default is simply an inevitable necessity, not a
choice. Their only choice is now when they will default, and with what
strategy. In this regard, their choices are essentially two.
On the one
hand, they can destroy their national economies, dilapidate their capital
stock, and destroy the living standard of productive working families
through criminally stupid austerity programs and budget cuts of the
vandalistic type dictated by the monetarist crackpots at the
International
Monetary Fund, European Commission,
World Bank,
Bank for International
Settlements, and similar institutions.
At the end of all this unspeakable
torture of austerity, they will find,
-
their political institutions destroyed
-
their internal governability and stability deeply compromise or totally
wrecked
-
their ability to pay lower than when they started
At the end
of all this, they will default anyway, and drift like derelict wrecks on the
world ocean.
Many of them will fall under dictatorships, or even fascist
regimes.
The alternative to this nightmare scenario is to use the time-tested weapon
of the unilateral financial debt moratorium as a means of national survival
and national sovereignty. (If Republican US President Herbert Hoover could
successfully propose an international financial debt moratorium among
Germany, France, and Great Britain, and the United States in June 1931 to
fight that depression, this approach cannot be regarded as wild radicalism.)
This freeze on all payments of interest and principal on international
financial debt must be conducted in an orderly, legal fashion, fully
explained to the population and presented as an integral part of a strategy
for national economic recovery.
Plans should be made in advance for
suppressing financial speculation, while mobilizing domestic economic
resources for the most ambitious projects of national public infrastructure
as a means to radically reduce unemployment and poverty. Raw materials must
be secured in advance through barter deals and other ad hoc arrangements
with the relevant countries, and these transactions must necessarily occur
outside of the straitjacket of IMF and World Trade Organization rules.
Countries using the weapon of debt moratorium should normally be able to
reduce their foreign debt exposure by about one half. If they play their
cards correctly, they can do even better for their people.
Every country needs to identify at least one area in which it can produce
the most advanced high technology capital goods for export, and strive to
become the world leader in that department. This production must be
capital-intensive, energy intensive, and high value added, and it must
target the world export market.
The goal is to produce something which the
world will find simply indispensable, independent of whatever protectionist
measures may or may not be enacted elsewhere.
This effort can be used as a
science driver along with other science drivers to restart scientific
discovery and technological research and development throughout the entire
national economy. This is the kind of strategy which the leaders of the
southern tier nations of the Euro should currently be elaborating.
And they need to act fast. By September, the tide of financial panic which
is now engulfing Greece and Iberia will be in the suburbs of Paris and
London .
