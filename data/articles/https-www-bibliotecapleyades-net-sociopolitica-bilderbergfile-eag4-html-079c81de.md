"The Objectives and Activities of the EAG, from their website http://www.eag.org.uk/ which contains a host of interesting information.
The Objectives and Activities of
The European-Atlantic Group
The European-Atlantic Group was founded in London in 1954 by the late Lord Layton (then Vice-President of the Council of Europe) together with other Members of both Houses of Parliament, industrialists, bankers, economists and journalists. (See Lord Bessborough's Report to the Group in 1955)
The main object of the Group is to promote closer relations between European and Atlantic countries by providing a regular forum in Britain for informed discussion of their problems and possibilities for better economic, strategic and political co-operation with each other and with the rest of the world.
The purpose of the Founders was to disseminate authoritative information concerning the work of International Organisations such as the Council of Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Union, the World Trade Organisation, and the Organisation for European Security and Co-operation.It has been addressed by leading Representatives of all these organisations.
In addition to holding monthly Dinners and Meetings in London, the Group has sent many Delegations abroad to study at first hand the European and NATO institutions in Brussels, Paris, Luxembourg, as well as visiting Germany, Italy, Turkey and Greece as the Guests of Governments and International Organisations.
Group Representatives have also visited the United States, Russia and Central European countries with the object of improving relations between the West and East.
The Group has also held discussions on European-Atlantic relations with the rest of the world, including the Middle and Far East, Africa and Latin America, with distinguished Speakers from many countries.
As the Group began (See draft of the first AGM Minutes in 1955, as amended by Elma Dangerfield OBE, a Founder and the Hon Director since then), so it has continued...
The European-Atlantic Group meets regularly (usually once a month) for Dinner-Discussions, sometimes preceded by a Meeting in a Committee Room at the House of Commons.

A typical E-AG evening comprises of a Meeting at the House of Commons lasting one and a half hours at which the keynote Speech by the Speaker is followed by an on-the-record discussion for an hour. The next phase of the event is an informal Reception, usually at the Hilton St Ermin's Hotel (See map by Streetmap.co.uk) followed by Dinner, after which there is a second speech, perhaps elaborating aspects of the preceding debate, and then a discussion in which guests participate, again for an hour and a half, this time off-the-record. Many Parliamentarians and Diplomats attend.
Whilst the above is the typical format, the E-AG also holds luncheon discussions, inclusive of the Ladies Committee annual Luncheon at the House of Lords. Details of venues and timings appear on the invitation notice for each event. The Group has also hosted events at Guildhall and the Banqueting House.
The European-Atlantic Journal is primarily a record of the speeches delivered to the Group, together with book reviews on subjects relating to International Relations. The texts of these speeches are available on this site.
