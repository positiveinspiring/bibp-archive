# TRUE DEMOCRACY SUMMER 2001

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/shadow/s01.htm

* Collecting comprehensive institutional and personal information
* By establishing national and international policy independently of the established Government
* By developing high-tech arms and equipment, and, with these, establishing small, specialized, highly mobile, elite military units to effect these covert policies, when need arises, without having to rely on the official (and "unreliable") Armed Services, (whose subservience to the Shadow Government is reasonably suspect)
* By developing an armed capability to repel any threat to the status quo, (including the uncertain ontological, social, and economic impacts of any revelation of the reality of UFO and extraterrestrial presence) through the development of a Star Wars/BMDO ground and space-based surveillance and SDI weapons network
* By denying information compromising to the Shadow Government from all those outside "need-to-know" policy-making levels
* By exercising control on the money supply, availability of credit, and the worth of money, through policy decisions made outside of the official Government
