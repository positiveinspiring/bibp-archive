Eric Schmidt
Google CEO Chairman
Eric Schmidt has tacitly
admitted that the companys
Facebook-style social networking platform,
Google+, is little more than a sprawling advertising database for the
benefit of big corporations to target end users.
During an interview with National Public Radio in Edinburgh over the
weekend, Schmidt responded to a question about why Google+ had adopted
real-name policies and in doing so eliminated anonymity for its users.
He (Eric) replied by saying that G+ was built primarily as an identity
service, so fundamentally it depends on people using their real names if
theyre going to build future products that leverage that information, NPR
journalist Andy Carvin
told Bloomberg Businessweek.
In other words, Google+ is a honey trap designed to sucker people into
revealing as many details about their personal interests, consumer habits
and spending patterns as possible, so that such information can be sold to
large corporations who can then use targeted advertising to sell products.
It begs the question of whom Google built this service for? You or them,
asks blogger Fred Wilson, noting how this is an admission by the company
that it wants to be an identity gatekeeper.
Schmidts admission makes sense when you consider the fact that Googles
GMail service uses the content of
supposedly private email communications to
create context-specific ads that are displayed alongside email messages.
2011
Bilderberg attendee Schmidt has repeatedly made his disdain for privacy
well known.
During a 2009 CNBC appearance, the Google honcho
stated,
If you have
something that you dont want anyone to know, maybe you shouldnt be doing
it in the first place, in response to concerns over Googles lack of
privacy protections for its search engine results.
The company has also been in hot water on numerous occasions for breaking
privacy laws in Canada and Europe over its
Street View service.
