If youve ever studied infomercials, you know the whole business is based on
back-end sales. Its not the product you buy for $19.95, its the products
they can hook you into after you spend the $19.95.
So it is with
Google Glass. Its all about the apps thatll be attached. .
Glass gives the wearer short-hand reality as he taps in. Thats what its
for. The user is on the go. If hes driving his Lexus and suddenly thinks
about Plato, hes not going to download the full text of The Republic to
mull while hes crashing into big trucks on the Jersey Turnpike. Hes going
to take a shorthand summary. A few lines.
People want boiled-down info while theyre on the move. Reduction. The
essentials.
This is perfectly in line with the codes of the culture. Ads, quick-hitter
seminars, headlines, two-sentence summaries, ratings for products, news with
no context. Stripped-down, reduced.
Well, here is a look into right now. A student at Stanford is developing a
Google app that reads other people.
From SFGate, 8/26,
Google Glass being designed to read
emotions: The [emotion-recognition] tools can analyze facial
expressions and vocal patterns for signs of specific emotions:
Happiness, sadness, anger, frustration, and more.
This is the work of
Catalin Voss, an 18-year-old
student at Stanford and his start-up company, Sension.
So youre wearing Google Glass at a meeting and it checks out the guy across
the table who has an empty expression on his mug and, above your right eye,
you see the word neutral. Now he smiles, and the word happy appears.
I kid you not. This information is supposed to guide you in your
communication.
The number of things that can go wrong? Count the ways, if
youre able. Im personally looking forward to that guy across the table
saying,
Hey, you, schmuck with the Glass, what is your app saying about me
now? Angry?
That should certainly enhance the communication.
Or a husband, just back from his 12-mile morning bike ride, enters his Palo
Alto home, wearing Glass, of course, and as he looks at his wife, who is
sitting at the kitchen table reading a book, sees the word sad appear
above his eye.
Honey, he says, recalling the skills he
picked up in a 26- minute webinar, have you been pursuing a negative
line of thinking?
She slowly gazes up at the goggle-eyed monster
in his spandex and grasshopper helmet, rises from her chair and tosses a
plate of hot eggs in his face.
YouTube, please!
But wait. Theres more.
The Glass app is also being heralded as a step
forward in machine-human relationships. With recognition services like
Google Now and Siri, when computers and human users talk to each other, the
computers will be able to respond not only to the content of the users
words, but also to his tone, his feelings.
This should be a real marvel. As youve no doubt already realized, the
emotion-recognition tool is all about reduction. It shrinks human feelings
to simplistic labels. Therefore, what machines say back to humans will be
something to behold.
Machine version of NLP, anyone? Im predicting a surge in destroyed
computers.
The astonishing thing about this new app is that many tech people are so
on-board with it. In other words, they believe that human feelings can be
broken down and worked with on an androidal basis, with no loss incurred.
These people are already boiled down, cartoonized.
You think youve observed predictive programming in movies? Thats nothing.
The use of apps like this one will help bring about a greater willingness on
the part of humans to reduce their own thoughts and feelings to
FIT THE
SPECS OF THE MACHINES AND THE SOFTWARE.
Count on it.
This isnt really about machines acting more like humans. Its about humans
acting like machines.
The potential range of human emotions is extraordinary. Our language, when
used with imagination, actually extends that range. Its something called
art.
The counter-trend is in gear. No matter how subtle the emotion-recognition
algorithms become, there will always be a wide, wide gap between what they
produce and the expression of humans.
The most profound kind of mind control seeks to eliminate that gap by
encouraging us to mimic technology. That means people will think and feel
less, and what they think and feel will mean less.
The machines wont say,
Im sorry, I cant identify that emotion,
its too complex.
Theyll say sad or happy or upset or
whatever they have to say to give the appearance that theyre on top of the
human condition.
Eventually, significant numbers of people will tailor their self-awareness
to what the machines point to, name, label, declare.
Thus, inventing reality.
The wolf becomes a lamb, the lamb becomes a flea.
And peace prevails. You can wear it and see with it.
Eventually, realizing that Glass is too obvious and obnoxious and bulky,
companies will develop something they might call Third Eye, a chip the size
of half a grain of rice, made flat, and inserted under the skin of the
forehead.
Perfect. Invisible. Of course, cops will have them. And talk to them.
Im parked at the corner of Wilshire and
Westwood. Suspicious male standing outside the Harmon Building.
I see him. Searching relevant data.
Which means any past arrests, race, conditions
noted in his medical records, tax status, questionable statements hes made
in public or private, significant known associates, group affiliations, etc.
And present state of mind...
The cop:
Recommendation?
Passive-aggressive, right now hes peaking at 3.2 on the Hoover Bipolar
scale. Bring subject into custody for general questioning.
Will do.
No one will wonder why, because such analysis
resonates with the vastly reduced general perception of what reality is all
about.
People mimic how machines see them and adjust their human thinking
accordingly.
Hand and glove, key and lock. Wonderful.
As the cop is transporting the suspect to the station, Third Eye intercedes:
Sorry, Officer Crane, it took me a minute
to dig further. Suspect is business associate of REDACTED. This is a
catch and release. Repeat, catch and release. Printing out four
backstage passes to Third Memorial Rolling Stones concert at the
Hollywood Bowl. Apologize profusely, give subject the tickets, and
release him immediately.
I copy.
This arrest and attendant communication is being deleted
now.
