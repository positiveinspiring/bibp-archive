The Pentagons surveillance net is massive. But
it was holes and seams.
Spy drone videos and communications intercepts
may be aimed at the same target. Analysts have a hard time flipping easily
from one kind of intel (intelligence) to the other, however -
allowing those targets to get away.
So the military is working on an out-there idea
to fix the problem:
a single mega-system that pulls together and
analyzes every kind of intel you can imagine.
If it works as planned, itll be a whole lot
harder to slip through that Pentagon net. No surprise that DARPA, the
militarys blue-sky research arm, is the agency behind the lofty
five-year program, called 'Insight.'
The agencys goal is to replace largely manual
exploitation and
chat-based operator interactions with a system that mines
different inputs, including drone footage and on-the-ground intel, and
quickly stitches together the data to identify potential threats.
What DARPAs calling,
a next generation
ISR
[intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance] exploitation and resource
management system would be faster than human analysts, but itd still
rely on their input.
DARPA wants an interface thats adaptable,
letting users provide context and pick the best surveillance combo for a
given situation.
The Pentagons been investing in super-powered surveillance for years now,
and DARPA wants Insight to capitalize on the rapid growth in the recon
field. The program will incorporate brand new spy cams, like
ARGUS-IS, a 1.8 Gigapixel camera that
tracks over 100 square miles in real time. And ongoing DARPA projects might
be rolled into the Insight system too.
The agencys solicitation cites a handful,
including the recently-launched
PerSEAS, a program to design complex
algorithms that can somehow spot threats based on little more than weak
evidence.
And DARPAs betting big on Insight.
The agencys creating an entire Insight Test
Bed, to be located at Fort Irwins National Training Center, thatll mimic
real world operational settings, complete with scripted scenarios. In
hopes of fast-tracking ongoing programs, DARPAs also prepping a
Development Incubator of unclassified data and evaluation results for
contractors.
The goal is to boost collaboration and lower the
cost of systems testing for developers - not to mention make it easier to
integrate their work into Insights eventual surveillance depository.
