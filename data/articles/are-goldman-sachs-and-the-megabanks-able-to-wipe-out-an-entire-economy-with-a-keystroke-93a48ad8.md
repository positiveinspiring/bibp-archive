"We have found no evidence that these events
were triggered by 'fat finger' errors, computer hacking, or terrorist
activity, although we cannot completely rule out these possibilities," a
recent Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) report on the so-called May
6 "Flash Crash" that wiped out a cool trillion in a mere half-hour
weakly admitted.
"Much work is needed to determine all of the causes of
the market disruption."
That's another way of saying that it remains
only the market makers that caused the largest single-day point decline in
Dow Jones history who actually know where the bodies are buried.
The rest of us, including the SEC, have a
Sisyphean task of sifting through mountains of dense data.
But regardless of
who ends up on the end of
possible criminal proceedings, the SEC is sure
that the whole clusterstock was seriously exacerbated by the robo-traders
executing light-speed electronic transactions via supercomputers, while
exposing our hyperreal economy as an Internet-worked casino.
If anything, the
Flash Crash proved that market
makers like Goldman Sachs and plenty more playing both sides of securities
could be capable - with the high-priced help of math and computer science Ph.Ds crafting up proprietary, recursive algorithms
- of wiping out any
corporation's stock,
perhaps any nation's economy, in a comparative instant
with just the press of a button.
"It was actually amazing watching it all happen," Gina Sanchez, Director of
Equity and Asset Allocation Strategy for Roubini Global Economics, told
AlterNet by phone.
"We went from risk-aversion to risk-seeking in the matter
of an hour. But it doesn't bother me so much that the algorithms went after
the bids. They were doing what they're supposed to do, which is seek out
arbitrage opportunities. What concerned me was how the bids got out there in
the first place."
That is the primary concern of the SEC as well.
But it's going to have a
hell of a hard time figuring out the human brains behind the inhuman bids
that remotely reduced the price of some once-reliable stocks to mere
pennies.
Thanks to the very technological innovations that has transformed
last century's stock market into an inscrutable hyperreality programmed and
deprogrammed daily by rapacious banksters, Wall Street's corruption cops are
drowning in deeper paperwork, virtual and otherwise, than ever before.
"Although developments in the markets and in technology may help speed
access to market data, they also greatly complicate our efforts to analyze
the complex web of trading arrangements and market dynamics that have
developed since 1987,"
SEC chairman Mary Schapiro confessed in a May 20
Senate hearing on the Flash Crash.
"For example, the key day in the
1987
Market Break Study involved a trading session processing a little over 600
million shares in NYSE stocks. On May 6, the markets processed 10.3 billion
shares in NYSE stocks alone."
What
Schapiro and the SEC really need to crunch all that digital data are
some genius math and science nerds, but they've all been conscripted by the
market makers to game the global economy.
It pays stunningly well, even when
it epically fails. After
engineering a global crisis that has so far swelled
America's national debt to $13 trillion, the too-big-to-fail
banksters are
now bigger, stronger and armed with bonuses for their predatory efforts.
In
fact, that success has emboldened them to continue their intrepid
devaluations.
Since the Flash Crash, the overall market has experienced
severe devaluations marking off technical corrections that place it out of
the reach of economic recovery.
Even in depressed economies, market makers
make out just fine.
"We don't really have a market as such anymore," Marshall Auerback, senior
fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, explained to AlterNet.
"It's a high-tech
casino. And that is actually an insult to casinos, which are probably better
regulated and which observe rules that make the house pay when it loses.
Unlike our Frankenstein investment banks, which get government handouts."
For those interested in the discrete details of the
Flash Crash,
the SEC's
report is a labyrinthine walk down a dark alley populated by drowsy
terminology, graphs, deconstructions and worse.
With unemployment still
strong, industries still cratering and lending still conventionally
disappeared, working people shouldn't have to give their valuable time to
it, which is, of course, how the banksters win in the end. Especially since
they pay more than the SEC ever will to sift through its shifty legerdemain.
But the short version is simply a high-tech, high-speed variation on the
type of confidence games that have been around forever.
The only difference
now is that they can be gamed in eyeblinks by machines whose capacity for
pattern recognition and
algorithmic trading is faster than ours.
The shorter
version is that they have no mercy, and there's nothing us puny humans can
do about it.
"Artificial intelligence is becoming so deeply integrated into our economic ecostructure that some day
computers will exceed human intelligence,"
American inventor, futurist and hedge funder
Raymond Kurzweil explained in a
speech to investors and other quantitative speculators in 2006.
"Machines
can observe billions of market transactions to see patterns we could never
see."
What those machines saw during the Flash Crash, according to the SEC, were
ridiculously priced bids valuing reportedly healthy companies at next to
nothing.
Since then, we need, the SEC report explained,
"to examine the use
of 'stub quotes,' which are designed to technically meet a requirement to
provide a 'two sided quote' but are at such low or high prices that they are
not intended to be executed."
Even so, the algorithms did their job, as
Sanchez explained, and processed those quotes without what would constitute
a rational human pause.
That lead directly to what Schapiro called "the
absurd result of valuable stocks being executed for a penny" in her Senate
testimony, and further evidence that when algorithms attack, they do so
according to their programming, even it doesn't make a lick of human sense.
Of course, there's the alternate theory, which is much less labyrinthine:
They were programmed specifically to make no conventional economic sense,
just literal cents.
Exacerbated by what the SEC report called "the
withdrawal of liquidity by electronic market makers," it's pretty reasonable
to assume that the Flash Crash's robo-traders attacked on purpose, searching
and destroying their targets with callous accuracy, while the banks and
traders supposedly committed to a "best execution" duty disappeared and let
the machines tear up the trading day.
Some lost out, as
thousands of trades
were canceled. Others meanwhile, scored huge.
For example, whomever programmed their computers to buy up shares of
world-beating
Apple Inc. at $199 locked in a price that hadn't been glimpsed
by the iPhone and iPad king in months. Better yet, they scored an immediate
20 percent payout for that timely investment in a matter of mere minutes, as
Apple's more conventional stock price returned to around $250 that same day.
No trader with an ounce of sense would ever expect to nail Apple at $199,
given its recent performance. But an enterprising investor placing a hopeful
stub quote on a nonplussed computer at a laughable $199 could get lucky,
provided he or she is supplied with the appropriately timed left-field Flash
Crash.
The computer, certainly, isn't going to stop Apple's financially
insane stock fall or subsequent rise from happening, if it's expected to
profit from it.
But the Flash Crash is the new normal for our economy, in which unregulated
stratagems like credit default swaps (valued at least at $36 trillion and
counting), naked shorts, high-frequency trading,
dark pools and more
deliberately inscrutable mechanisms all suck up taxpayer and investor money
without ever creating anything of actual value for most of us.
In fact, the
mounting evidence - despite all of the digital front-running strategies,
securitized derivatives web-works or members-only traders' clubs - is
spectacularly clear:
These technological and scientific stock-market
innovations have chiefly resulted in sociopolitical and economic misery for
the world-at-large.
"These kinds of products serve no social purpose whatsoever," Auerback told
AlterNet. "And they have come to excessively dominate trading. We seem to
confuse means with ends."
Sure, if one is expecting the worse of us to care about the distinction.
But
in our new millennium, humans and computers alike are executing gamed trades
using next-generation technology and algorithms whose morality is colder
than math itself. With them, there is no distinction between means and ends,
nor is there supposed to be. All that matters is the payday, in the end.
Everything else is collateral damage.
And we should have seen it coming, because this has often been the case with
technological and sociopolitical evolution.
With each new innovation, we
have found even newer ways to exploit our surroundings and each other. We
took weapons designed to keep us well-fed, and used them to kill each other
to the point of genocide. Our excessive fossil fuel consumption - which has
increased our mobility, convenience and connectivity - has also led us to a
climate crisis that could conceivably leave most of our planet uninhabitable
within a couple cosmologically short centuries.
And especially lately, we
have used our economic, mathematical and technological ingenuity to find
ways not to make us all richer, but to wipe out trillions in wealth in the
relative blink of an eye.
It's no wonder our
algorithms are assholes.
