Wall Street funded Communists
Professor Sutton stated,
"Western textbooks on Soviet economic
development omit any description of the economic and financial aid given
to the 1917 Revolution and subsequent economic development by Western
Firms and banks."
"In the Bolshevik Revolution we have some of
the world's richest and most powerful men financing a movement which
claims its very existence is based on the concept of stripping of their
wealth," declared Allen.
"[M]en like the Rothschilds, Rockefellers,
Schiffs, Warburgs, Morgans, Harrimans, and Milners."
Perloff agreed,
"Jacob Schiff, the head of Kuhn, Loeb and
Co., heavily bankrolled the [Communist] revolution. This was reported by
White Russian General Arsine de Goulevitch in his book Czarism and the
Revolution."
"According to his grandson John," described
Allen, "Jacob Schiff... long-time associate of the Rothschilds, financed
the Communist Revolution in Russia to the tune of $20 million."
He continued,
"According to a report on file with the
State Department, his firm, Kuhn Loeb and Co. bankrolled the first five
year plan for Stalin," and added, "Schiff's descendents are active in
the Council on Foreign Relations today."
Referring to the emergence of a communist
dictatorship which resulted from the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, Professor
Marrs wrote that they were funded by,
"Germany and America... Their repugnant
campaign to purify and cleanse Mother Russia and to seek world
domination resulted in... [millions of] human beings wiped out and
brutally purged..."
He attested,
"Brown Brothers Harriman" helped finance it
with "money made possible by it and the affiliated Guaranty Trust
Company."
Professor Sutton agreed, writing,
"W. Averell Harriman was a director of
Guaranty Trust Company" and "was involved in the Bolshevik Revolution."
On February 3, 1949, the New York
Journal-American stated, "Today it is estimated even by Jacob's grandson,
John Schiff, a prominent member of New York Society, that the old man sank
about $20,000,000 for the final triumph of Bolshevism in Russia. Other New
York banking firms also contributed."
Referring to a June 15, 1933, Congressional Record, Allen wrote "Congressman
Louis McFadden, chairman of the House Banking Committee, maintained in a
speech to his fellow Congressman:
"The Soviet government has been given United
States Treasure funds by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal
Reserve Banks acting through the Chase Bank and the Guaranty Trust
Company and other banks in New York City...
Open up the books of Amtorg, the trading
organization of the Soviet government in New York, and of Gostorg, the
general office of the Soviet Trade Organization, and of the State Bank
of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and you will be staggered to
see how much American money has been taken from the United States'
Treasury for the benefit of Russia."
"Now our textbooks tell us that the Nazis and Soviets were bitter
enemies and their systems are opposites," observed Professor Sutton.
But in the,
"1920s, W. Averell Harriman was a prime
supporter of the Soviets with finance and diplomatic assistance... [and]
participated in RUSKOMBANK," which was "the first Soviet commercial
bank. Furthermore, Max May, the Vice President of Guaranty Trust, which
was dominated by Harriman and Morgan, became the first Vice-President of
Ruskombank."
However, declared Professor Sutton,
"Averell Harriman, his brother Roland
Harriman, and... E.S. James and Knight Woolley, through the Union
Bank... were prime financial backers of Hitler."
He asked,
"How could a rational man support Soviets
and Nazis at the same time?"
A curious dilemma arises when faced with the
documented fact that Wall Street funded both Communists and Nazis.
First, it would seem these two forms of
government are at opposite ends of the political spectrum. And that
capitalists would see them as a threat to their growth.
Allen provides a possible answer, writing,
"But obviously these men have no fear of
international Communism. It is only logical to assume that if they
financed it, and are willing - even eager - to cooperate with it, it
must be because they control it. Can there be another explanation that
makes sense?"
He adds,
"Remember that for over 100 years it has
been a standard operating procedure of the Rockefellers and their allies
to control both sides of every conflict."
Before Winston Churchill became Prime Minister
of Great Britain, he acknowledged a conscious effort of wealthy people to
install a communist dictatorship in Russia.
He wrote in the February 18th, 1920 issue of the
London Illustrated Sunday Herald, that,
"From the days of Spartacus [Adam] Weishaupt...
to those of Karl Marx, to those of Trotsky, Bella Kuhn, Rose Luxembourg,
and Emma Goldman, this world-wide conspiracy has been steadily growing."
He affirmed,
"It has been the mainspring of every
subversive movement during the 19th century; and now at last, this band
of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities
of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of
their heads and have become practically undisputed masters of that
enormous empire."
After the Bolshevik Revolution, Wall Street
ensured the communists would retain control of Russia. Professor Sutton
described this effort when he wrote, "On may 1st, 1918, when the Bolsheviks
controlled only a small fraction of Russia (and were to come near to losing
even that fraction in the summer of 1918), the American League to Aid and
Cooperate with Russia was organized in Washington, D.C to support the
Bolsheviks. This was not a 'Hands off Russia' type of committee formed by
the Communist Party U.S.A or its allies. It was a committee created by Wall
Street with George P. Whalen of Vacuum Oil Company as Treasurer and Coffin
and Oudin of General Electric, along with Thompson of the Federal Reserve
System, Willard of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and assorted
socialists."
"The Bolsheviks were not a visible political force at the time the Czar
abdicated," Allen wrote. "And they came to power not because of the
downtrodden masses of Russia called them back, but because very powerful men
in Europe and the United States sent them in. "They [Lenin and Trotsky]
joined up, and, by November, though bribery, cunning, brutality and
deception, they were able (not to bring the masses rallying to their cause,
but) to hire enough thugs and make enough deals to impose out of the gun
barrel what Lenin called 'all power to the Soviets.'"
"Having created their colony in Russia," said Allen, "the Rockefellers and
their allies have struggled mightily ever since to keep it alive. Beginning
in 1918 this clique has been engaged in transferring money and, probably
more important, technical information to the Soviet Union." Perloff agreed,
writing, "Probably no name symbolized capitalism more than Rockefeller. Yet
that family has for decades supplied trade and credit to Communist nations.
After the Bolsheviks took power, the Rockefellers' Standard Oil of New
Jersey bought up Russian oil fields, while Standard Oil of New York built
the soviets a refiner and made an arrangement to market their oil in Europe.
During the 1920's the Rockefellers' Chase Bank helped found the
American-Russian Chamber of Commerce, and was involved in financing Soviet
raw material exports and selling Soviet bonds in the U.S."
According to Senator Barry Goldwater, Chase Manhattan built a truck factory
in Russia which could also be used to produce armored vehicles such as tanks
and even rocket launchers. Perloff echoed, "American technology helped the
Soviets construct the $5 billion Kama River truck factory... [which was]
successfully converted by the Kremlin to military purposes."
Wall Street continued to aid the Russian communists as they supplied the
Vietnamese communists that Americans were fighting in Vietnam, says Allen.
In the late 60s Rockefeller and other industrialists built synthetic rubber
plants and an aluminum factory totaling about 250 million dollars. Professor
Sutton observed, "these American capitalists were willing to finance and
subsidize the Soviet Union while the Vietnam War was underway, knowing that
the Soviets were supplying the other side."
An article appeared in the New York Times on January 16, 1967, which carried
the headline, Eaton Joins Rockefellers to Spur Trade with Reds. Perloff
summed up the story, "The ensuing story noted that the Rockefellers were
teaming up with tycoon Cyrus Eaton, Jr., who was financing for the Soviet
block the construction of a $50 million aluminum plant and rubber plants
valued at over $200 million." He added, "The Chase, which maintains a branch
office at 1 Karl Marx Square in Moscow, has gained notoriety for financing
projects behind the Iron Curtain."
StalinPictured left is Averill Harriman of the CFR (center) with Stalin
(right) & Winston Churchill.(*) W. Averill Harriman was made U.S. Ambassador
to the USSR in 1941. Allen wrote, "Sutton quotes a report by Averell
Harriman to the State Department in June, 1944 as stating: 'Stalin paid
tribute to the assistance rendered by the United States to Soviet industry
before and during the war.'" "It is not an exaggeration to say that the USSR
was made in the USA," observed Allen.
Referring to Professor Sutton's book, Wall Street and the Bolshevik
Revolution, he wrote, "No one has even attempted to refute Sutton's almost
excessively scholarly works. They can't. But the misinformation machines
that compose our mediacracy can ignore Sutton. And they do." The book, added
Perloff, "is based on assiduous research, including a deeper probe into
State Department files."
Professor Sutton warned,
"The synthesis sought by the Establishment
is called the New World Order. Without controlled conflict this New
World Order will not come about... And this is being done with the
calculated, managed, use of conflict... This explains why the
International bankers backed the Nazis, the Soviet Union, [and] North
Korea... against the United States. The 'conflict'... [builds] profits
while pushing the world ever closer to One World Government. The process
continues today."
Summary
The evidence that these researchers present, which includes mainstream news
and State Department records, suggests that Communist Russia was not only
heavily funded by Wall Street, but was the actual creation of Wall Street.
The Communist Revolution was instigated by Wall
Street. Wall Street continued to build Russia even as they supplied aid to a
country that America was at war with. Because they created communist Russia,
they must have known about the millions of people being murdered.
