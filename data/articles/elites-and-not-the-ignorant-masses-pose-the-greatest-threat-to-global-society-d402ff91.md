# Elites and Not the "Ignorant Masses" Pose the Greatest Threat to Global 
Society

In January, at the annual World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland - largely a
meeting of corporate elites and political leaders - the
billionaire CEO Steve Schwarzman courteously
granted an interview to Bloomberg
Television.
When asked about the
American political scene, Schwarzman responded just as
many of his colleagues have:
With utter bewilderment.
"I find the whole thing
sort of astonishing, and what's remarkable is the
amount of anger, whether it's on the Republican side
or the Democratic side," he said, in a slow cadence
that served to highlight his confusion.
"Bernie Sanders, to me,
is almost more stunning than some of the stuff going
on on the Republican side. How is that happening?
Why is that happening? What is the vein in America
that is being tapped into, across parties, that's
made people so unhappy?"
"Now," he concluded,
smiling, "that's something you should spend some
time on."
After Donald Trump became
the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and
after citizens of the United Kingdom voted to leave the
European Union, commentators and elites alike have
taken Schwarzman's recommendation to heart.
They have
ventured to find out precisely what's going on.
Following a combination of
backward-looking and introspection, the view that has
come out on the other end has often been striking:
Europe and the United States, many suggest, are in fact suffering
from a surplus of democracy.
The people, the masses,
driven by irrational fears and overblown anxieties, are
exercising their reactionary impulses and using their
influence to take a sledgehammer to the system.
Historically, conclusions of
this kind are nothing new.
In response to populist
upheaval and democratic movements from below,
the elites
always attempt to muster
a response to at once explain the discontent and
quash the resulting backlash.
This year, however, has been
unique in many ways, one of them being the boldness with
which elites have asserted not just their right to rule,
but their sense of moral obligation.
And this boldness,
as Bloomberg's interview with Steve Schwarzman makes
clear, has come tinted with a profound disregard
for the circumstances experienced by working men and
women across the globe.
"It's time," declared James
Traub in Foreign Policy, in perhaps the most
brazen assertion of the assumed duty of the ruling
class, "for the elites to rise up against the ignorant
masses."
Reviving the contempt for
the public famously expressed by such figures as John
Adams ("the
mob") and his son, John Quincy Adams ("the
rabble") - as well as the reverence for elites
expressed by influential characters from Plato to Walter
Lippmann - Traub insists that it,
"is necessary to
say that people are deluded and that the task of
leadership is to un-delude them."
But while it is cloaked in
the garb of objectivity, Traub's insistence that elites
"rise up" is little more than the latest edition of, in
the words of
conservative commentator Ross Douthat,
"A powerful
caste's self-serving explanation for why it alone
deserves to rule the world."
Traub urges us to recognize
the growing gulf between those who acknowledge reality
and those who don't, those who care about facts and
those who toss them aside in the name of political gain.
But what Traub doesn't seem
to recognize is that elites, by selling
the public false goods for decades, helped spark the
rise of racist demagogues like Donald Trump, Marine Le
Pen, and others.
-
It is elites, not the masses, who have
fallen into self-serving delusions that have resulted
in unspeakable damage to the globe and its citizens.
-
It is elites -
including Traub himself - who have for decades
cloaked devastating wars in the soaring rhetoric of
"humanitarian intervention."
-
It is elites who have
forced upon crumbling economies austerity that has
served to prolong
and worsen already dire circumstances.
-
It is elites
who have peddled the fantasy
of neoliberalism, which has created a system that
lavishly rewards
the wealthiest while leaving everyone else to
compete for the rest.
-
It is elites, political and
corporate, who have devastated the environment in the
name of profit.
-
It is elites who have crashed the global
economy.
The masses, for their part,
are always there to pick
up the costs.
And they're sick of it.
Traub and others are correct
to deplore the anti-immigrant sentiment preyed upon by
loud-mouthed bullies, and they are justified in their
fears that populist anger could result in the election
of charlatans like Donald Trump, both in the United
States and throughout Europe.
They cannot be forgiven,
however, for the key roles they played in creating the
disasters - economic, political, and military - to which
the masses are now responding.
And they cannot be
forgiven for ignoring the consequences of their actions
by blaming an excess of democracy, rather
than a lack of it, for global upheaval.
"Voters in America not only
aren't over-empowered, they've for decades now been
almost totally disenfranchised, subjects of one of the
more brilliant change-suppressing systems ever
invented," writes
Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi, in an assessment
that could equally apply to Europe.
"People have no other source
of influence," Taibbi continues.
"Unions have been
crushed. Nobody has any job security. Main Street
institutions that once allowed people to walk down the
road to sort things out with other human beings have
been phased out.
In their place now rest distant,
unfeeling global bureaucracies."
Elites, by forcefully
eliminating avenues for democratic progress, have
cultivated the environment in which anti-establishment
sentiment now thrives.
And the major political
parties of the wealthiest nations on earth, in order to
curry favor from big business, have pushed
aside the needs of the working class, often
disregarding workers as
racists unworthy of attention.
And the punditry has
dutifully followed suit.
For example, in an
appearance on Slate's Political Gabfest, NPR's
Adam Davidson casually
floated his contempt for working people while
simultaneously lavishing praise upon
Hillary Clinton's
economic advisers.
"I know Hillary Clinton's
economic team fairly well, and I'm very impressed by
them," Davidson gushed.
"They really are top-notch
economists and economic policy thinkers. They don't have
anything for a 55-year-old laid-off factory worker in
Michigan or northeastern Pennsylvania. Or whatever.
They
dont have anything to offer them."
This flippant dismissal of a
significant portion of the labor force - particularly those
without a college degree - is characteristic of
elite disdain for "the rabble," those who would dare
think they deserve a dignified existence in a
globalized, technologically advanced economy.
Thus the
view of Pennsylvania Republican Michael Korns has
become commonplace.
"Many voters feel that the
Democratic Party, which they had supported for
generations, has largely abandoned blue-collar workers,"
he said.
"There's also increasingly a feeling that the
Republican Party has abandoned them as well, that
neither party has much interest in the day-to-day
economics of working people. And then when Trump came
in, he spoke to them, he grabbed them."
Out of this dilemma,
elitists like Traub have created a false dichotomy:
-
on
one side, there's Trump and a gang of nationalists
thriving amidst the combination of economic anxiety and
anti-immigrant sentiment
-
on the other, there's the
"rational" coalition of business and political leaders,
ready to set the world right again after a period of
upheaval
Ignored, of course, is the
agenda of social
democracy put forward by figures like
Bernie
Sanders, whose policies, in many cases, terrify
elites more than the explicit racism and
unpredictability of Trump.
So elites have framed the
picture as one portraying a stark choice:
The phony
populism of Trump or the stuffy technocracy pushed by
self-interested elites, elites who have been explicit
about their contempt for the very people they are
now trying to "un-delude."
It is no wonder, then, that
many are siding with the former - people recognize that
it is elites who have designed the system that has been
so devastating for so many.
"Both Republican and
Democratic administrations entered trade
agreements designed to put downward pressure on the
wages of domestic manufacturing workers," writes Eric
Levitz.
This is, as Josh Bivens has documented,
true of the economic system as a whole: It was designed
to fail - at least for the majority.
Meanwhile, the wealthiest
have thrived, particularly in the United States, where
they have seen their incomes grow
by over 300 percent while everyone else's have
stagnated:
"workers as a group," notes political
scientist Thomas Ferguson, "haven't
had a raise in a generation."
This has fed the perception among
Americans and Europeans that their influence on the
direction of their nations - both economically and
politically - has dwindled, and perhaps disappeared
entirely.
The problem for elites
attempting to counter this perception is, of course,
that it's accurate.
As the political scientists
Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page have shown,
"the average citizens' influence on policy making... is
near zero."
The result is mass
disaffection, sometimes resulting in anger, and
sometimes, apathy.
"Increasing numbers of
average Americans can no longer stomach voting for
parties that only pretend to represent their
interests," notes Thomas
Ferguson.
Who can blame them? And who
can blame those who long to thwart the political and
corporate leaders who continue to peddle politics and
economics as usual?
Until elites come to
recognize the fact that the system they have cultivated
- the system that has allowed them to thrive at the
expense of everyone else - has helped to foster the kind
of resentment they are now desperately attempting to
suppress, they will continue to be the target of those
whose material circumstances have become unbearable, in
large part due to the global economic order.
But in all likelihood, they
will not recognize this fact.
As Upton Sinclair used
to say,
"It is difficult to get a man to understand
something, when his salary depends upon his not
understanding it!"
