The Masonic origins of the Islamists movements,
and their true goal to undermine Islam and fight for Western Zionist Powers
such as Britain and the United States of America.
The Muslim Brotherhood has acted as a clever technique to recruit
agent-provocateurs for
the Illuminati. The lowest ranks may
sincerely believe they are defending Islam, and confronting "Western
imperialism". However, these various terrorist groups, through representing
different factions, are part of a single network serving the same Illuminati
cause.
When we explore the political and financial connections of the
terrorists, we find that these are not merely wayward fanatics, operating in
isolation, but that their channels penetrate to the upper reaches of power,
in the British and American governments, and outward into the nether
regions of the occult and criminal underworlds
The real Muslim Brothers are those whose hands are never dirtied
with the business of killing and burning.
The Muslim Brotherhood are the
secretive bankers and financiers who stand behind the curtain, the
members of the old Arab, Turkish, or Persian families whose genealogy places
them in the oligarchical elite, with smooth business and intelligence
associations to the European
Black Nobility and, especially, to the
British oligarchy
And the Muslim Brotherhood is money.
Together, the Brotherhood probably controls
several tens of billions of dollars in immediate liquid assets, and controls
billions more in day-to-day business operations in everything from oil trade
and banking to drug-running, illegal arms merchandising, and gold and
diamond smuggling.
By allying with the Muslim Brotherhood,
the Anglo-Americans are not merely buying into a terrorists-for-hire racket;
they are partners in a powerful and worldwide financial empire that extends
from numbered Swiss bank accounts to offshore havens in Dubai, Kuwait and
Hong Kong
