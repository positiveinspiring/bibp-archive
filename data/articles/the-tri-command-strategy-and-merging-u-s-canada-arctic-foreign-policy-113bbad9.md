The Arctic has become an important part of North
American perimeter security.
Recently, the U.S. and Canada signed two new
agreements that will expand bilateral military training, security and
defense operations in the region. Both countries are working together to
prepare for any real or perceived threats and are moving towards merging
their Arctic foreign policies.
On December 11, 2012, the U.S. and Canada signed the
Tri-Command Framework for Arctic Cooperation which will further
integrate,
-
United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM)
-
Canadian Joint
Operations Command (CJOC)
-
North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)
According to a
press release,
the framework is designed to,
promote enhanced military cooperation in the
Arctic and identify specific areas of potential Tri-Command cooperation in
the preparation for and conduct of safety, security and defense operations.
USNORTHCOM, CJOC and NORAD will work more closely in the region with regards
to planning, domain awareness, information-sharing, training and exercises,
operations, capability development, as well as in the area of science and
technology.
This also ties in with the
Tri-Command Training and Exercise Statement of Intent.
The newly signed military document is aimed at,
enhancing joint and combined readiness in
support of safety, security and defense missions through combined
training and exercises and reinforcing partnerships and collaboration
among the Commands.
The latest U.S.-Canada military agreements are
part of the Tri-Command strategy and demonstrate the importance being placed
on the Arctic.
The
Tri-Command Vision has previously called for USNORTHCOM, NORAD and
Canada Command which has now been replaced by CJOC to,
Improve unity of effort with each other and
with our respective mission partners; develop a culture of continuous
collaboration and cooperation in planning, execution, training,
information management, and innovation; enhance intelligence and
information sharing and fusion.
In order to better achieve these objectives,
The Commands shall develop and share
comprehensive, situational awareness and a common operating picture, and
must strive to interact seamlessly with each other and with our
respective civil authorities, non-governmental organizations and other
mission partners.
The Tri-Command is part of efforts to merge both
countries, security and military priorities under the umbrella of a single,
U.S.-dominated North American Command.
As part of the April 2011 U.S. Department of Defense
Unified Command Plan, responsibility for the Arctic region is now shared
between USNORTHCOM and USEUCOM.
With the move, USNORTHCOM was given the primary
task of planning and advocating for future Arctic capabilities, as well as
engaging with stakeholders across the U.S. military, other agencies and
international bodies.
This is significant considering USNORTHCOMs
partnership with CJOC, along with NORAD and was instrumental in the
development of the Tri-Command Framework for Arctic Cooperation.
In an example of what we can expect with regards
to joint Arctic security, Canadas 2010 military sovereignty exercise,
Operation Nanook included the U.S. and Denmark.
The Arctic is also an emerging issue for the
NATO alliance. Canada and the U.S., along with other NATO member countries
have participated in the annual
Cold Response war games. Strengthening its military presence in the
region and enhancing security collaboration with Canada and other northern
partners has become an essential component of Americas Arctic strategy.
In mid-2013, Canada will begin chairing a two-year term of the
Arctic Council with the U.S. assuming the leadership role from 2015-17.
Many view this as an opportunity for both countries to advance a North
American Arctic agenda.
The intergovernmental forum which also includes,
-
Denmark
-
Finland
-
Iceland
-
Norway
-
Sweden
-
Russia,
...promotes cooperation, coordination and
interaction among the Arctic states.
The Arctic Council has signed an
Agreement on Cooperation in Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue
which became the first legally binding deal ever negotiated between all the
eight Arctic nations.
As far as military and security concerns go, in
April 2012, Canada hosted a meeting of the
Northern Chiefs of Defence to discuss shared Arctic interests. This
included common safety and security issues in the region such as emergency
response and support to civilian authorities.
The conference provided a setting to hold
multilateral and bilateral talks focused on the Arctic and there are calls
to have similar meetings on a regular basis.
The U.S. and Canada share similar goals and concerns in the Arctic and are
further building up their military presence in the region. With a strategic
framework in place, both countries are working towards establishing a North
American Arctic foreign policy.
At times, Canadian and Russian rhetoric in
regards to Arctic sovereignty has been reminiscent of the Cold War era. Rising tensions could further escalate the
militarization of the far north. Increasing diplomatic efforts is the key to
building the foundation for more multilateral cooperation in the area.
While the process to resolve territorial
disputes and the scramble to secure resources has thus far been peaceful,
the Arctic still remains a potential flashpoint for conflict.
