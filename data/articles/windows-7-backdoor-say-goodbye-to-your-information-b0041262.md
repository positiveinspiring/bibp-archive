This is a major step to
the New World Order...
Our personal information is being robbed of us,
and sent off to the NSA's databases, where it is stored and which will be
used against us. If you speak out about this, you will be jailed and
considered a National Threat!
We should switch over to other OS's like
Ubuntu or
Linux,
which are virtually unhackable. Or, if you live in Europe in a small country
like Latvia, Estonia, Sweden or Lithuania then you're safe.
Protection against possible NSA backdoors on
Windows 7
If you are a Windows 7 user you will want to
protect your life, wife and kids from outside interference, but this
will be extremely hard now that it is known the NSA had access to
Windows 7 before you.
The obvious advice is that you should not
use Windows 7 at all, but if you must, at the very least try to stop any
possible NSA malware with open source security software:

extremely hard now that it is known the NSA had access to Windows 7 before
you.
The obvious advice is that you should not use Windows 7 at all, but if you
must, at the very least try to stop any possible NSA malware with open
source security software:
-
Do not use the Windows 7 firewall get
some old computer and install a free open source firewall based on
FreeBSD such as
M0n0wall
-
Do not use Microsoft Windows Defender
get a free open source antivirus such as
ClamWin
-
Watch what data packets are being sent
out and where, download a free packet sniffer such as
Wireshark
-
Visit the
Open source as alternative website
and grab your alternative open source software to any Windows 7
applet
