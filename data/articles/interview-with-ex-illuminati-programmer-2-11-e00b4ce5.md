# Interview with Ex Illuminati Programmer 2 - 11

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/illuminati/svali2_11.htm

Q: Svali, have you ever come forward publicly with that story, or is
this the first time?
A: I have never gone into the demonic aspects much, because it is so
controversial (ie. your question below!). I have shared this before
with my husband, my therapist, and a close friend. I'm not really a
"public" person, I've only posted some articles at Suite101.com, to
help others who are trying to get out of the cult.
I hate sensationalizing stuff, personally, because it can detract
from the real problem; children are being hurt and abused, and the
abuse needs to stop. Call it demons, aliens, or whatever, there are
evil men (and women) using small children and profiting from their
pain. That is why I have spoken out against this group.
Q: I am certain that a lot of readers will say 'Come on, now I know
this is just sci-fi, how can this be real?!' and would want to see
some proof or evidence to that. What would you say to them?
A:
I would say "go to a ritual, you will see plenty" except that I
don't want ANYONE to ever see or be near that type of evil.
Spiritual realities don't leave physical marks, but I think it is
interesting that throughout recorded history, mankind has written
about these type of phenomena.
Could all of our recorded histories be false? Could mankind be a
pathological liar throughout the centuries in this area? If a person
visits Africa, they will also hear accounts of shape shifting done
by the occult, and there, they DON'T dissociate, so you can
interview people who have seen it while fully conscious.
In
South America, and Asia, this also occurs. How could a world-wide
phenomena be made up by groups that had no previous contact with
each other?
Does the demonic leave a trail, a mark that I can point to? No. But
does it leave an indelible impression on those that have witnessed
it? Yes, and even in premedieval times, this type of stuff was
recorded.
I didn't take videos or snapshots of this stuff happening, so a
person has to decide whether they believe it or not based on oral
testimony. I don't really care. I know what I saw.
Q: Also, to wrap this interview up for now, what do you see as the
Illuminati's Achilles Heel, their vulnerability? Is there any way to
stop them, and a way for humanity to move on and say 'It is
finished!'?
At the moment it seems hopeless, sort of like having your fingers in
a chinese finger trap, - you know what I'm talking about - with no
way out.
A:
1. Their arrogance (I think I mentioned this before) is their
weakness. These people think they are untouchable, and this could
make them careless.
2. If by a miracle, enough people took this SERIOUSLY and started
organizing in some way to stop the Illuminati take over, with prayer
and God's guidance, perhaps they could be stopped. I hope so, with
all of my heart.
3. Stopping pornography and child prostitution and drug smuggling
and gun running would take out a huge chunk of their profits. Maybe
they would slow down. But honestly, stopping the above would be as
difficult as stopping the group.
4. To be honest, I don't know what could really stop them. I have
written about this group to try and expose them, I have gone to the
police several times, given videotaped testimony against them in a
court case (the interview was with 5 lawyers and took 3 hours),
knowing that my ex-headtrainer would be seeing a copy of the video
(I thought about smiling and waving and saying "hi Jonathan", but
then decided that might be going a little too far).
I have encouraged others in getting out, and helped a few survivors
find safe housing and a way to stay out. I guess each person has to
do their best in fighting these people, in the way they feel led to.
My skills tend to be in writing, so I am using them.
Q: If you have any last comments or think there are some areas we
have not touched or topics you would like to take us to, please feel
free to share those.
A: If anyone has heard the sobs of a child when it has been used
brutally by adults, or the screams of a child psychologically
terrorized, they would do anything they could to stop this abuse.
There are children as young as three and four being used in
pornographic films, beaten black and blue if they refuse to comply.
There are toddlers being forced to watch brutalities, then given a
stick and told to go over and hit the victim themselves, or they
will be beaten. The child hesitates, it doesn't want to, and the
adults hit the child, until the child goes, tears streaming down its
face, and unwillingly does what the adults tell it. This is cruelty
beyond belief.
To see a slightly older child with an electric dog collar around its
neck, shocked when it tries to "escape" and treated as an animal, to
the laughter of the adults and older children around it, and the
child goes over to a bush and vomits from fear and self-loathing.
These are the pictures that any survivor of the Illuminati holds in
their heart, and these are the reasons I will write and write about
them to expose them, and why my heartfelt prayer is that they can be
stopped. I wish I were making this up, but I'm not. I wish I didn't
have these pictures engraved in my memory, but I do.
Q: Svali, would you be willing to answer readers questions or
feedback, in form of some future article? I think there may be some
questions coming in for you at some point, probably to cover some
details about your story.
A: I would prefer that they send their questions to you, and then
you forward them, if possible. I don't want to get a lot of "hate
mail" because I am writing about a topic that is controversial and
politically incorrect to talk about.
I'm sure there will be those who say, "oh, she just wants
attention". Well, I get plenty of attention at the classes I teach,
with a room full of students, and lots more fun besides. I get
attention seeing my NON abuse articles in print, and make money
besides (which I don't when I write about this)..
No, I want to expose these people, that's my motivation. Some will
believe what I am writing, others won't. That's fine with me. If
they feel the need to vent their disbelief, that's fine, as long as
I don't get lots of cuss words, or people saying I'm stupid (oh,
yes, I get letters like that at times) or uneducated.
Sorry, none of the above are true. I have 2 university degrees. I
had to, I was told to by the cult. They don't let stupid people
lead.
Oh, and HJ, I won't just disappear on you or recant anything I
wrote. You can email me anytime with questions, and I will
delightedly expose what SOBs this group is composed of. Oops, that
doesn't sound Christian there, but God appreciates honesty, doesn't
He? I'm only accurately describing them. I'm still working on
forgiveness, as you can see...
Q: Svali, I'm grateful you took the time to share those experiences
with us, which I'm sure was neither easy nor pleasant. I wish you
all the best, for you and your family. Perhaps more people will read
this, and pass this article on to others. Maybe we can stop all of
this shocking brutality, child abuse, the Illuminati someday. It's
never too late. Thank your very much for this interview, Svali.
