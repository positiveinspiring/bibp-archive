U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations
Here is another office which doesn't need to be operational. The documentation
shows that it "gathers intelligence affecting aerospace operations, and has
a compartmented unit involved in investigating UFO sightings, extra-terrestrial
contact reports, as well as IAC [Identified Alien Craft] surveillance, and
coordination with NRO interdiction operations.
Let's allow the extraterrestrial people to have peace. Petitions have been
signed by millions of people who state that they want space to be saved for
peace.
There is no doubt in my mind that there are other humans in outer space.
There have to be. Since we exist, there must be intelligent life elsewhere
too. In fact, the reason why this agency exists proves that there are extraterrestrial
beings somewhere in space.
