After Britain's humiliating retreat from Dunkirk
June 4, 1940, Winston Churchill defiantly declared,
"We shall fight on the beaches...we shall
never surrender..."
His confidence was based on his certain
knowledge the United States would back Britain to the hilt.
The vast majority of Americans were against intervention. But a covert
British propaganda and "dirty tricks" campaign, employing almost 1000 people
in NYC (mostly Brits and Canadians), had hijacked democracy with the full
cooperation of the FDR administration. It illustrates how London-based
central bankers control the American people to this day.
The Republican Party was against intervention. Thanks to the British, the
Republican Presidential nomination June 28, 1940 went to an unknown
pro-intervention pro-conscription "internationalist" Wendell Wilkie,
a lifetime Democrat who had never held public office.
On the eve of the costliest war in US history, (one million dead or maimed,
$2 trillion in 1990 dollars), Americans were not given a choice. There
wasn't an anti-war candidate. Does this remind you of 2004 or 2008?
More than propaganda was involved. The organizer of the Republican
convention, Ralph Williams, an "isolationist" (doublespeak for
patriot) conveniently died May 16 and was replaced by a lifelong British
agent Sam Pryor who packed the convention with Wilkie delegations and
supporters shouting, "We want Wilkie."
True, Williams was 70 years old.
But historian Thomas Mahl says that the
British mandate included murder and he implies this took place. Heinrich
Muller, the Chief of the Gestapo who worked for the CIA during
the Truman administration confirms that the British killed many Americans
who got in the way. (See Gregory Douglas,
The CIA Covenant - Nazis in Washington, p.107)
" [Wilkie's] nomination exempted President
Franklin Roosevelt from the normal pressures of an election campaign,"
Mahl writes in his explosive book "Desperate Deception: British Covert
Operations in the US, 1939-44." (1998)
Walter Lippmann wrote,
"the sudden rise and nomination of Wendell
Wilkie was the decisive event, perhaps providential, which made it
possible to rally the free world...Under any other leadership but his,
the Republican Party would ... have turned its back on Great Britain..."
(164)
If a Republican nationalist like Robert Taft had
won the nomination, Churchill was prepared to make peace with Hitler and
abandon Stalin to his fate. The Jewish holocaust wouldn't have occurred
because of Hitler's wish for good relations with England.
In a repeat of World War One, American
intervention prolonged the war with disastrous consequences for mankind.

The Illuminati game plan was for a long two-front war that the Nazis
would lose. Although Mahl doesn't mention the Illuminati by name, his
book exposes its modus operandi, which I will detail later.
To recapitulate for new readers, the Illuminati is the highest echelon
of Freemasonry. Since its foundation in 1776, it has pursued the
enslavement of humanity using world government or "internationalism" as
an artifice.
http://www.savethemales.ca/001260.html
Based in the City of London, the Illuminati represents the families that
own the world's central banks. Through intermarriage, this clique
combines Jewish finance and European/ American aristocracy in the
pursuit of money, the occult, and its own supremacy.
It must enslave humanity to protect its monopoly over credit. The
government does not create money. It borrows it from the central bankers
who create it out of nothing and charge interest.

Their aim to colonize the whole world is the real meaning of Western
imperialism and the essence of the
New World Order. Nations (like the US
and England) movements (Communism, Feminism, Zionism and Fascism) and
peoples (Jews and Arabs) are all sacrificial pawns in a
multi-generational plan to create a Luciferian world dictatorship.
Central to the plan are wars contrived to distract, demoralize and
destroy humanity. Each war increases Illuminati power and wealth and
makes mankind accept banker domination. World War Two was no exception.
CENTRAL BANKERS AND SPIES
The
Rockefeller and Morgan empires are part of the central banking cartel.
At the highest level, all intelligence agencies (MI-6, CIA, Mossad, KGB)
answer to this cartel, not to their national governments.
"British Security Coordination," (BSC) part of MI-6 handled the
Illuminati campaign to frog march the USA into World War Two. It was
financed by the Rockefellers and Morgans and housed rent-free on the 38th
Floor of the "International Building" of Rockefeller Center.
"This was a convenient address," Mahl
writes. "Several British agencies promoting intervention were also
housed here. The British Press Service was located on the 44th Floor.
The British intelligence front group Fight for Freedom located its
operations on the 22nd floor in the same building, also rent free." (11)
Wendell Wilkie had been an organizer at
numerous Democratic conventions. He was the President of a Morgan-controlled
insurance company and a member of the "Fight for Freedom" executive. His
whole campaign was financed and organized by the Morgans and British
intelligence but made to look homespun.
After losing the 1940 election, Wilkie worked closely with FDR to sabotage
nationalist Republicans and was briefly considered for FDR's VP in 1944.
Instead, his usefulness apparently at an end, he conveniently died in that
year at age 52 of a "streptococci throat infection" contracted in hospital.
The BSC's minions might be forgiven for thinking the Rockefellers were
opponents of Fascism. In fact, the central banking cartel brought Hitler to
power. The Rockefellers provided the Nazis with oil and owned part of
Germany's largest industrial concern,
I.G. Farben. They provided the Nazis
with indispensable technology and materiel before and during the war, at the
expense of the US war effort.
Charles Higham's book "Trading
with the Enemy" demonstrates that the central bankers had an intimate
economic relationship with the Nazis through corporations like Standard Oil,
General Motors, Ford, ITT and the Chase Bank.
Defeating Nazism was not the immediate goal of American intervention. The
goal was to have a long, devastating and lucrative war, leading to greater
concentration of power in their hands through the Cold War and world
government (the European Union and the United Nations.)
THE MODUS OPERANDI
In the 1930s, the American people learned how the bankers had maneuvered the
US into World War One for great profit. Congress passed a battery of
legislation to prevent this from happening again. British PM Neville
Chamberlain called the US Congress "pig headed and self righteous nobodies."
Thus the Illuminati had to change public opinion before FDR could commit the
US to war. Their main weapon was the mass media, literally owned by the
central bankers or controlled by advertising from their cartels.
In 1940, publications owned by the central bankers and their front men
included
All were decidedly for intervention. Hollywood
also produced war propaganda. Alexander Korda, director of "Lady Hamiliton"
and "The Lion has Wings" was a British agent.
Journalists achieved success as spokesmen for British Intelligence. They
included:
-
Walter Winchell
-
Drew Pearson
-
Dorothy Thompson
-
Walter Lippmann
-
James Reston
-
Hubert Bayard Swope
Public opinion polls were rigged or edited to
give Americans the impression they favored intervention. For example, a
British agent David Ogilvy put out the Gallup polls.
Nationalist politicians like Hamilton Fish, Martin Dies and Burton Wheeler
were smeared as pro-Nazi and anti Semitic. They were hounded with false
charges and eventually defeated. One, Senator Arthur Vandenburg changed his
mind with the help of beautiful socialites working for British Intelligence.
The British manufactured German atrocity photos and a phony map purporting
to be a Nazi plan to divide South America. This map helped FDR overturn the
last remaining neutrality legislation. Phony horoscopes fore casted ruin for
Hitler and American "isolationists."
Like the Communists, the British formed numerous groups that masqueraded as
grass roots organizations.
They included:
After the war, the Rockefeller's
Council on Foreign Relations ensured that
official histories of American intervention were written. They did not want
a repeat of the embarrassing revelations of how the US was tricked into
World War One.
COMMUNIST JEWS
The British would have abandoned Stalin only as a last resort. British
Freemasonry (i.e. the central bankers) was behind the Bolshevik Revolution
but by pretending to be opposed, Britain was able to betray their allies,
the nationalist White Russians. The bankers later created Nazi Germany
because Stalin had become too nationalistic himself.
www.savethemales.ca/000275.html
The bankers were going to let the two titans fight it out like monsters in a
Japanese B-movie but Hitler had to lose because Germany represented a much
greater threat to their plans than Russia.
Mahl's book provides glimpses into this confluence between the central
bankers, the British, Jewish leaders, and the USSR.
For example, the BSC subsidized the Overseas News Agency, which was a branch
of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, founded by Jacob Landau. Banker Felix
Warburg also subsidized the JTA, whose job was to publicize persecution of
Jews. Landau was also on the executive of "Fight for Freedom."
Decrypted VENONA messages (wires between the Soviet embassy and Moscow)
reveal that Landau was working for both the British and the Soviets. He
traveled to Mexico City in 1943 and had several meetings with the Soviet
ambassador.
Mahl writes:
"the VENONA messages reveal... Soviet secret
intelligence had thoroughly penetrated BSC and its offspring OSS" (which
became the CIA.) (49)
William Stephenson headed BSC. His Second - in - Command was Col.
Charles "Dick" Ellis a member of MI-6 who organized and ran
the future CIA. According to Mahl, Ellis was,
"also suspected of working for German and
Soviet intelligence services." (194) (Neither men were Jewish.)
This picture is consistent with the view that
the central bankers control all Intelligence agencies and wars are just a
charade.
See my "Are
World Wars Orchestrated?"
FINALLY
Freud's nephew Edward Bernays helped manipulate the masses for the
Illuminati.
In his book "Propaganda," he wrote:
"The conscious and intelligent manipulation
of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important
element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen
mechanism of society constitute an
invisible government, which is the
true ruling power of our country."
Wars are orchestrated to eventually produce
Illuminati world government. As the Masonic leader Albert Pike wrote in
1871, the third world war will be between the "political Zionists and
Islam."
Translated, that means the
US and Israel versus Iran and possibly China and
Russia.
Americans are being frog-marched to the next world war.
The present period
might be compared to the 1930's when both sides armed and rehearsed. The
final conflagration, possibly in 2010-2012, would eliminate a large number
of "useless eaters."
