Orlando False Flag Clue #1: Alleged Killer Worked for G4S
The notorious G4s is a British
multinational private security company, the world's largest by
revenue. It has already been exposed as having ties with Israel,
and the security-intelligence apparatus of the U.S.-UK-Zionist
axis (CIA, MI6, Mossad).
For instance, G4S was helping Israel
with its prisons before recently
pulling out due to unfavorable publicity (thanks to
the BDS movement).
It is therefore rather intriguing that the
suspected mass killer/shooter (or patsy) Omar Mateen, a
29-year-old Muslim man, has been a G4S employee since 2007.
Here is the
official statement from G4S:
"Omar Mateen was employed by G4S at a residential community
in South Florida and was off-duty at the time of the
incident. Mateen was subject to detailed company screening
when he was recruited in 2007
"
G4S is connected to 9/11 and
Guantanamo too, as this
article on Washington's Blog
states:
"Previously called Securicor, G4S provided security at all
three airports affected by the 9/11 attacks. Securicor/G4S
had bought
Argenbright Security - the 9/11 airport security
firm - just nine months before the 9/11 attacks.
The company later ran operations at Guantanamo
Bay."
Orlando False Flag Clue #2: Alleged Killer Already Known to
the FBI
With so many of these false flag
events, the killers or patsies are already known to the FBI or
other intelligence agencies. The FBI knew about Mateen;
they evaluated his potential for terrorism by interviewing him
at least two different times.
You may recall that the FBI has
become famous of late for its "sting operations", where it has
knowingly and willingly orchestrated fake terrorist acts to
supposedly make us safer, while at the same time entrapping
gullible people to play along and justifying its own existence.
Orlando False Flag Clue #3: Alleged Killer Shot Before He
Could Speak or Be Tried
Dead men tell no tales. Omar Mateen
has been shot, so we're never going to hear his side of the
story.
This is certainly not the first time
this has happened.
Orlando False Flag Clue #4: Supposed Pledged Allegiance to
ISIS
ISIS is the pet frankenstein of
the
New World Order, so you can thoroughly expect the ISIS card to
be played at false flag events to further (and falsely) cement
in people's minds the idea that ISIS is a real and imminent
threat to America.
It is patently obvious to many by
now that ISIS-IS-ISIL-Daesh is a
U.S.-Israeli creation.
Just like Islamic terrorists
supposedly chanting "Allah Akbar" every time before they kill,
the pledge of allegiance to ISIS has become a standard
ingredient in the recent Western false flag recipe.
Orlando False Flag Clue #5: Drill Occurred 3 Months Prior in
Orlando
You know the drill. Same time, same
place, same event.
With this Orlando mass shooting,
there was a
MCI (Mass Casualty Incident) drill that
occurred 3 months ago, although there is not much
information about the nature of it.
Orlando False Flag Clue #6: 666 Numerology
As with almost all false flag
attacks, there is a numerological marker to the Orlando false
flag event.
The attack took place yesterday on
June 12th, 2016, written in American English as 6/12/2016. There
is a 6, then five central digits (1 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1) which equal
6 when added together, then an ending 6, making a 666.
The occult symbolism of this number
is painted all over Illuminati and other
Secret Societies
events. Coincidence? You decide.
Orlando False Flag Clue #7: More Than 50 Dead
Another reason to suspect the
official narrative of the Orlando mass shooting is simply the
alleged numbers of dead victims.
We come across the same loophole in
the official story of
Sandy Hook, where skinny kid
Adam Lanza is supposed to have shot and killed 26 people in
record time.
As
Kevin Barrett writes:
"More than 50 dead? Only one shooter? And the guy was not
even a special forces professional, but a flaky security
guard?! (Who just happened to be on all the National
Security radar screens, like so many others now-proven
patsies.)
Sorry,
MSM, that doesn't pass the smell test.
It's funny how almost all "Muslim terrorists" are either,
-
ridiculously
ultra-competent supermen able to take down
skyscrapers and blow up the Pentagon using a couple
of package-openers as their only weapons
-
kill ludicrously large
numbers of people in mass shootings without any
military training
-
or otherwise perform
amazing feats of mass carnage,
or else they are the world's LEAST competent
destruction-wreakers, defuses who can't get a match lit to
try to blow up their own shoe, or who pack their underwear
with sterno camping fuel and no detonator and somehow expect
their crotch to explode."
