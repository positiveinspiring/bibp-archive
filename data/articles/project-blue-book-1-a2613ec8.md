During 20 years of existence Project Blue Book logged 12,618 reports - 701 remained unsolved. This list of 701 UFO reports represents all of the "unexplained" sightings recorded by the Air Force's Project Blue Book, a seventeen year investigation.
The list provides the dates, locations, and Blue Book case numbers for the incidents.
As I do not have a great amount of time available to pursue follow-ups exclusively, comments to me should be directed to dona@bilver.uucp in mail.
The following files (6) are from the work of Don Berliner, who compiled a listing of the Project Bluebook "unknowns".
