Since Soviet Russia's 1991 dissolution, successive US administrations governed increasingly lawlessly and recklessly,

increasing belligerence toward Russia and China,
...points to eventual confrontation. Unknown is to what extent, but when conflicts begin, they take on a life of their own. Starting them is easy, resolving them another matter entirely. America has turned planet earth into a battleground. All US post-9/11 wars continue, resolution nowhere in sight. Peace and stability defeat America's imperial agenda. Conflicts serve it. Clinton's public record as first lady, US senator and secretary of state shows,
her rage for war her contempt for rule of law principles and democratic values
her rage for war
her contempt for rule of law principles and democratic values
She's for unlimited military spending, phony war on terror continued, likely escalated, use of banned weapons, and super-ones in conflicts she calls peacekeeping deterrents. Before primary/caucus season began, she was chosen Democrat party nominee, Sanders going along for the ride, a political opportunist, a populist in name only leading a nonexistent political revolution. Its illusion persists, to fade straightaway once a new administration takes power, Clinton its likely head, plotting pure evil before assuming office, likely aided by false flag deception. Trump is in trouble, losing momentum, outrageous racist and other extremist comments making more enemies than friends. In late May, he fired his national political director, Rick Wiley, suggesting campaign disarray. Now top aide Corey Lewandowski is gone. Dismissing him this late in the game indicates trouble. It gets worse. On last Sunday's Meet the Press, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R. WI) said Republicans are free to withhold support for Trump if they wish, stating:
"The last thing I would do is tell anybody to do something that's contrary to their conscience (sic). This is a very strange situation. This is a very unique nominee."
Trump responded, claiming he can win with or without party backing.
Its members,
"need to listen to the American people," he said. "Let me run for president. I think I'm going to do very well."
In May, his campaign raised only $3.1 million, compared to $28 million for Clinton.
He entered June with $1.3 million on hand, way short of Clinton's $42 million. His unorthodox style won millions of adherents during primary season, campaigning one-on-one against Clinton another matter entirely - backed by Wall Street, war-profiteers, most media scoundrels, and other powerful entrenched interests. He's at a distinct disadvantage, Clinton the establishment favorite, he an outsider, tolerated at best by GOP party bosses after going all-out to stop him.
America's political system is notoriously corrupt, candidates for high office pre-selected, outcomes predetermined.
Will things be rigged to defeat Trump in November, Clinton chosen with electronic ease, voter role purges and other devious tactics assuring her selection? Is the process over before it begins?

WW II followed Hitler becoming German chancellor, supported by Wall Street bankers and London.

Coronation of Malevolence
- Hillary Clinton as President - by Phil Butler June 24, 2016
from Journal-Neo Website
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is threatening.
Some critics worry a Clinton presidency will decimate the nation's reputation and future. Still others suggest, that another Clinton in office will seal America's fate.
Here's a look at the potential catastrophe of Hillary in the White House.
"Take 'two Bushs' and 'two Clintons', and call the undertaker in the morning."
The world cannot stomach any more of the New World Order cabal.
Another Clinton administration may well end America's reign as a trusted nation among nations. The Middle East is a mess because of these people's ties to big oil and big money. This is irrefutable.
The WikiLeaks compilation of Clinton emails proves complicity, if not downright collusion. Economies teeter on collapse, Europe is in tatters, and millions are more miserable for Clinton's efforts. This too, is irrefutable.
While Donald Trump is a severe unknown commodity, Clinton is a damnable tyrant in the making.
If moderate America does not wake up before November, hell on Earth may arrive ahead of schedule.
Here's proof.
Instigator of Instability Hillary Clinton was instrumental in bringing about "Arab Spring", and the chaos that followed.
30,000 emails from her now notorious private emails was compiled into searchable form by WikiLeaks. Since independent journalists began scouring them, more pieces of Clinton's seedy détente appear daily. And the picture taking shape is a nasty one.
This declassified document tells us of the Obama administration's intention to overthrow Syria's government from the start.
The document introduction is damning:
"The best way to help Israel deal with Iran's growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad."
There are hundreds of these mails, but the short take for every nation in Europe is, the Democrats caused Arab Spring, and sent millions of refugees to the shores of the EU.
There is no disputing this fact, and if the people of Europe ever fully grasp this, America's reputation won't be worth one-red-cent.
Not only is Clinton implicated in helping ignite the chaos that grips Europe now, her collaborators in France, Germany, Brussels, and London are revealed for their greed as well.
This Washington Post story speaks of Clinton, Obama, French President Sarkozy, and the pillaging of Libya once Muammar Gaddafi was killed. The piece is aptly titled "Hillary's War".
Clinton's role makes her a conspirator...
This piece by Neil Clark at RT reveals Hillary Clinton as orchestrator in the Syria regime debacle as well. The reportage also shows Google and Al Jazeera in cahoots with Clinton and the Obama administration to foster still more misery on Syrians.
The WikiLeaks cables show Clinton communicating with Google executives over a new tool known as "Google Ideas", which was to be used to encourage still more refugees to defect.
Clark cites Jared Cohen, President of Google Ideas, from July of 2012:
"Please keep close hold, but my team is planning to launch a tool on Sunday that will publicly track and map the defections in Syria and which parts of the government they are coming from," Cohen wrote. "Our logic behind this is that while many people are tracking the atrocities, nobody is visually representing and mapping the defections, which we believe are important in encouraging more to defect and giving confidence to the opposition," he continued.

The evidence Clinton was behind creating refugees and weaponizing them is incontrovertible.
And remember, the White House later accused Vladmir Putin of making the downtrodden weapons. Make no mistake, the people in the Obama administration were "full on" into using every means to topple Assad. And I mean "every means".
The email in question was sent to three top officials,
Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns (a former Ambassador to Russia) Alec Ross, a senior Clinton adviser on innovation Clinton's deputy chief of staff, Jake Sullivan
Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns (a former Ambassador to Russia)
Alec Ross, a senior Clinton adviser on innovation
Clinton's deputy chief of staff, Jake Sullivan
Sullivan forwarded the message to Hillary, with the unrepentant comment,
"FYI (for your information) - this is a pretty cool idea."
Cool and Callous Ideas for Humanity
"A pretty cool idea", the tone is unmistakably wicked.
These advisers to advisers, and to future presidents, they wreak of careless abandon. Jake Sullivan must be, a poster child for zombie-like Millennials. Just looking at him repulses me, just to be clear.
Pencil neck, suck ups, the remora of Washington policy, they do more damage than even the think tank dinosaurs. And Sullivan is a genotype of everything wrong in America right now.
But there are thousands of these neocon urchins running amok, I only wish I had time to profile them all.
Google geeks, Facebook connectives, media collusion, ties with ousted Russian oligarchs, the Soros and Rockefeller connections, Goldman Sachs, and killing on a worldwide scale for the sake of profit - linking Clinton to the worst of humanity is fairly easy.
She is the real "connective" to Washington deceit and lies, and to more controversy than any American administration was ever involved in. Make no mistake about it, these people were raised up to feel superior, to install their belief systems onto society.
The danger of the Clintons, the Google execs, and the new liberals is, they actually believe their own fairy tales.
Washington today is a marriage of elitist ideas to utterly failed policies of the past. With a mission to perpetuate supra-capitalism and an American nightmare, the capital of the free world is a snake pit infested with opportunists.
It is symbolic that Jake Sullivan is married to Margaret Maggie Goodlander, who is a former speechwriter to Senator Joe Lieberman and senior policy advisor to Senator John McCain. Anyone with a mind for puzzles can piece together why Libya is linked to the Euromaidan events cheered on by the Arizona senator.
But the killing and chaos these people wrought is only the telltale sign something is horribly wrong. The money underneath is the cause of all this suffering.
The Clintons, and handlers like George Soros, win sacks full of money in the end. If Clinton supporters would only investigate objectively, any with a conscience would vote Trump in a heartbeat. The linkages and deals are so apparent, here again my argument is irrefutable.
I recall a moment of catastrophe, when Hillary Clinton's presence of mind was on investing, rather than human suffering.
The Womanliness of Nero
When MH17 was blown out of the sky by as yet undisclosed perpetrators, Hillary Clinton met with Charlie Rose later in the same day.
I covered the story for RT. Within a few hours, the White House had already established the Malaysian Airlines' plane's fate. But Hillary Clinton's mindset on the way to Bloomberg TV studios in Manhattan was damnable, though few took notice.
Rose asked Clinton,
"What questions would you be asking?"
In her answers, as MH17's victims' bodies were still smoldering, the etched into my mind the true evil of this woman.
She assured the audience and Rose, that MH17 was "obviously" downed by an anti-aircraft missile. She goes on to proclaim "the equipment had to have come from Russia", but it was her next comment that sticks in my mind.
She tells Rose that she was reading about the Russian stock market as she travelled to the studios.
The stock market plunging in Russia, why was Hillary focused on Russia stocks? I think the reader will know why. I profile here, the reincarnation in female form of Nerō Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, the man who fiddled as Rome burned.
Clinton fans will need more proof, of this I am sure.
At the basal level at which Hillary Clinton's core support lives, dead babies in far off lands do not even register. A world on fire, with Clinton's matchbox left in evidence, would be of no consequence to ultra-liberals bathing in their detestable form of freedom.
To the Clinton supporter, Hillary is the smiling, friendly, neighborhood dope dealer. Every junkie happily turns over his morality, for another fix.
But there's enough proof, for those not yet hooked for life. The woman who would be president, she's run by the elites for certain. Her opponent Bernie Sanders has told this, but America does not believe, or does not care one.
Not many readers will know how Obama, Clinton, George Soros, Lord Jacob Rothschild, and ousted Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorvkosky are linked.
I will brief you.
Barack Obama had many talks with then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev about the former Yukos oil billionaire who was pilfering billions from the Russian people. When Khodorovkosky got political, and showed his greedy teeth to Putin and Russian leadership, his misdeeds landed him in prison. Obama and Clinton whaled and moaned over the Russian Mafioso who's as much a killer as a tycoon. Yukos oil had Rothschild, Soros and Nixon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on its books, and Khodorovkosky was on the board of the infamous Carlyle Group. The linkages there lead to former Secretary of State James Baker III, and then to former President George H.W. Bush. Hillary's husband's administration also played a key role in almost destroying Russia, when Yeltsin's administration gave these oligarchs enourmous powers. Obama's National Security Advisor, Condoleeza Rice, wrote about "Clintonistas" overlooking the "looting of Russia's assets" by these Mafioso oligarchs.

And Mr. Putin is blamed by these same "Clintonistas" for jailing Khodorovkosky...?
Hillary Not Domesticated
The trail of blood and money leading to Hillary Clinton's doorstep is thick and sticky.
But her lies to her constituents are even nastier.
This article on The Nation tells us how misleading she is. Michelle Alexander eviscerates Clinton's domestic policy.
"Why Hillary Clinton Doesn't Deserve the Black Vote" stings.
An honest depiction of Clinton smoozing, a naïve black constituency, it puts Clinton in perspective.
The black vote, it's crucial for Clinton, and Alexander frames the subterfuge with this:
"The love affair between black folks and the Clintons has been going on for a long time. It began back in 1992, when Bill Clinton was running for president. He threw on some shades and played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show. It seems silly in retrospect, but many of us fell for that."
"The love affair between black folks and the Clintons has been going on for a long time.
It began back in 1992, when Bill Clinton was running for president. He threw on some shades and played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show. It seems silly in retrospect, but many of us fell for that."
The article lives up to its claim,
"the Clintons decimated the black community".
But still Clinton's support mimics some kind of Pied Piper zombie apocalypse, black preachers still stand on the pulpit and laud Hillary as a savior.
Latinos in the Clinton plans mirror other minorities too.
This report via Latin Rebels tells us how Clinton misleads all her constituents. The author, Hector Luis Alamo pins Hillary and her husband to the firing squad wall over a Columbian program unprecedented in its cruelty.
Plan Columbia was characterized a success by Clinton, but Alamo remembers the time otherwise:
"(It was).. a period of unbridled violence and human rights abuses committed by the U.S.-sponsored Colombian government and right-wing paramilitary groups. The drastic increase of U.S. funding for Colombia's security forces beginning in 2000 allowed an already repressive government to carry out even more atrocities."

Clinton's Asian American and Pacific Islander outreach director, Lisa Changadveja left the Clinton campaign in March.
And on women's issues, Clinton is no less slippery and nebulous in her true intentions.
This Quartz piece hammers Clinton and her female supporters over the head - and hard. Hanna Kozlowska tells the story of a 25 year old "girl power" activist named Gemma Soldati.
The heroine of the story asks key questions of her parents, who are devout Hillary fans.
"So, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton?" being chief among them.
She wonders how come expediency has somehow come to outweigh morality, in talking to her "flower power" parents.
And it is in this we see the cold political truth materialize. Clinton, and all of her constituents, cares not a wit for ideals. I have good company in calling Hillary Clinton the biggest liar in Washington. Some would go so far as to crown her queen of the world of liars.
This story convicts here with page-on-page of evidence.
Patricia McCarthy, of the American Thinker says of Clinton:
"She has fooled, and made fools of, many, many people over the years. Those who think she would be a good president are worse than fools."
A Leader of Fools
Like I said earlier, blood, tears, and sweaty money lead like a yellow brick road to Hillary and Bill Clinton.
Maybe her worst contrivance is her unapologetic narcissistic way of bragging over toppling Gaddafi lights the corners of your mind? But my Hillary nightmare trends toward her defiling of her own countrymen, and her reckless abandon for women's rights.
Kathleen Willey blows the whistle on Hillary with, "Hillary wrote the book on terrorizing women".
Willey, one of the women caught in the crossfire of alleged sexual harassment by former President Bill Clinton, has been on the receiving end of the presidential hopefuls spite.
Speaking of Clinton's comparisons of the Republicans to ISIS, she says:
"This is a woman who is comparing the Republicans to terrorists? Terrorists who behead women, who deface women, who burn women alive. And on and on and on and on. And I can tell you, knowing what I know, and reading what I've read, and having talked to people, other women, who have been in the same boat that I have been in, basically in the crosshairs of the Clintons. The one difference between me and the poor women who are the victims of ISIS and all the other terrorist groups is that our heads are still attached. That's the difference."
"This is a woman who is comparing the Republicans to terrorists?

That's the difference."
I'll finish off with this.
The essence of Clinton as a person and a leader is in this statement.
From my perspective, having monitored her support in social media, the unholy meanness and/or stupidity of her constituents is universal too. The allegations against Bill and Hillary Clinton are monumental, epic, and never before heard of to most people.
From Bill Clinton supposedly taking a romantic jaunt in 2002 to convicted pedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein's "Orgy Island," to the Clinton Foundation's receiving billionaire blood money, no leaders in history have had more controversy.
If the Clintons are guilty of one tenth, both should be banished from American shores.
Hillary Clinton is the most dangerous threat to America's future that exists today. The allegations and the evidence stacked against her is what I would call "grievously horrid", she's the most despicable leader I can imagine in the White House.
Barack Obama's sellout lunacy will seem as child's play, if the people behind Hillary get her in the White House.
The book Clinton Cash should stand up in court, as grounds for throwing Bill and Hillary in a federal prison. For if it were not all true, how could author Peter Schweizer escape condemnation?
It's significant that there is no court case, the Clinton's have not hired a Manhattan law firm to sue yet, and that other journalists have found still more duplicity in Clinton dealings.
The key revelation in the book was Hillary's role in selling off key strategic uranium to Russian concerns. It is an allegation that would have brought a treason trial just a few years ago.
And this is the malevolent monarch Americans would choose.
God save us if she is...
