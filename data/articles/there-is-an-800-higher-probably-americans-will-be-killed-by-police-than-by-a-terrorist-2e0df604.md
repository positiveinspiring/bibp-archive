The Ferguson incident has exposed the underbelly of the United States and
now everyone is starting to pay attention that there is a higher risk of
being killed by police even when they chase or shoot at people who need not
be you.
The risk is 800% greater that you will be killed
by POLICE rather than a terrorist.
The Economist has reported the death by police
so far are,
But that is not the half of it.
Since
911,
the police have killed more people than the terrorists are claimed to have
done in those attacks. It is getting to the point that if you see a
policeman in the USA, you better try to move away. This is no longer the
'50s. If there is a cat in the tree, my bet they will try to shoot it first
but probably take down the tree with the hail of bullets.
Police seem to think they have the right to play
soldier and war games on the streets of America.
Charles-Louis de Secondat Montesquieu, baron de La Brede et de (1689-1755)
was truly perhaps the most influential of the political French philosophers
who did more to alter the course of the world than anyone of this time.
He
gave us the separation of power for the structure of the United States and
the Second Amendment - right to bear arms.
In Vienna, Montesquieu met the political leader and soldier, the Prince
Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736), whose political discussions helped spark ideas
within Montesquieu expanding his understanding of government.
It was this
encounter between Montesquieu and the Prince of Savoy that shaped the right
to bear arms. For Prince of Savoy was considered even by Napoleon as one of
the seven greatest strategists in military history. He fought against the
Turks (1683-1688, 1697, 1715-1718) and he fought against the French in the
War of the Grand Alliance (1689-1691).
He was the teacher of even Frederick
the Great of Prussia (b 1712; 17401786) who he shaped into a brilliant
military strategist.
The Prince of Savoy also fought in the War of the
Spanish Succession (1701-1714), but he was plagued by a rumor that he was
really the illegitimate son of King Louis XIV of France that he perpetually
denied.
Yet, Louis XIV was always ashamed of such offspring and he
restrained Eugene's ambitions as if he was perhaps his son so that after 20
years of living in Paris and at Versailles, he left France and offered his
talent to Leopold I (1640-1705), Holy Roman Emperor who was fighting the
Turks.
He distinguished himself in the siege of Vienna in 1683 and his
military career was born.
Prince of Savoy acquired a brilliant skill and the wisdom that allowed him
to see that military victory was merely an instrument for achieving
political ends. He was Europe's most formidable general who was wounded 13
times himself, yet always faced a world of cunning foes with conspirators at
his back that he regarded as the "hereditary curse" of Austria serving three
emperors, Leopold I, Joseph I, land then Charles VI.
Of these men, Prince of
Savoy considered that the first had been a father, the second a brother, but
with the third, he was just the hired help.
The Prince of Savory came to see that standing armies would be easily used.
A talented general, he realized that there should be no armies and that
would reduce war.
The brilliant insight of the Prince of Savoy greatly
influenced Montesquieu, that it laid the foundation for the right to bare
arms, as the
Second Amendment to the United States constitution for the idea
was to eliminate standing armies that feed the cycle of war returning the
nation to the very was Rome began - with citizen militias.
The Police are out of control and have become standing armies within the
civilian population.
They are truly our greatest risk to national security
that should be defined as the welfare of the people not the safety of
government. This will be the greatest threat to our liberty moving forward
into 2020 domestically.
They are trained to see us as the enemy for they are
there to protect government from the people. Of course there are always
individual exceptions. Some can be turned. This was the key to winning the
revolution in Ukraine.
Turn the police against government and you stand a
chance to win freedom...
