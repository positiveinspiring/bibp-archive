on by Aliens?

1. Why did ACC decide to
place the history in its site? Which the contact point --beyond,
sure, the computers-- of ACC with the past of the transistor?
REPLY: We were outraged by much of the story, and felt
the Public had a right to consider it, without our claiming it
to be true or false. It's the Public's right to decide if it is,
in whole or in part, or if the party who related it to us, was
portraying a fiction. The story is too fundamentally profound to
be ignored out of hand.
2. ACC was, already for several times, accused of using
the page on Roswell to promote spam. How does the company reject
those accusations?
REPLY: Exactly how does one "promote spam" with a
website? Spam is defined as the "unsolicited mailing of an email
item to a third party". We do neither. We did, however, become
the object of hate mail and lots of SPAM direct at shutting us
down during the course of the past few months.
We have been publicly critical of
Scott McNealy, the head of a competitor: Sun Microsystems, Inc.,
for advocating the SPAMMING of Bill Gates, the head of
Microsoft, as was related in the New York Times, last week. That
should tell you what our opinion of SPAM is.
3. An exhibition with a fantastic content still demands
tests more fantastic. Do these tests exist? Which are they?
REPLY: We do not understand the specific question. Please
be more specific.
4. The messages in the Internet revealed the occurrence
of an invasion to ACC soon after the publication of the
material. Did that invasion really exist?
REPLY: presumably you are referring to the "break-in" at
ACC's offices. Yes, the break in took place, the front glass
door was shattered and had to be replaced, and we found things
missing and new things added among an inventory we took. Yes,
the US Air Force OSI came to our offices, and examined the
scene, then filed an entirely incorrect report with the offices
of the Public Information Officer.
Both events are a matter of public
record with the Air Force (although the report, discovered by a
member of the public, is at once both incorrect AND incomplete,
for reasons we are sure relate to National Security) and with
the local Police Department (which aside from mentioning names
and companies, is typically vague for a local police
investigation - also do perhaps to the presently unsolved crime
the break-in constitutes). Yet, the OSI report does not mention
the break-in, and the Police Report does not mention the OSI
investigation.
5. The same messages that talked about the invasion said
that CIA had been at the building of ACC. Who did call CIA? What
did happen in the chats among the employees of ACC, or you, and
the agents of CIA?
REPLY: The CIA was not ever alleged to be at the
building. We contacted the CIA by phone seeking their assistance
to identify the unusual "Satellite" referred to in the
mysterious FAX sent to our office the week before the break-in,
which has been concluded to have been some kind of ruse intended
to get our attention.
6. Which the size of ACC? Does the company cross
financial difficulties?
REPLY: ACC is the spin-off of another company, but was
founded in 1970. It is presently owned by Bell North America
Corporation. I am not at liberty to tell you how we ended up
being owned by BellNAC at this time, as the merger is still in
progress. The company has experienced some expenses it didn't
expect to, financially, from the cost of pursuing the ongoing
investigation of the Roswell related matters, due to the 10,000
emails per day, the large number of interviews, and so on.
We have had one major client cancel
its contracts with us because it simply doesn't believe in what
we have done re the Roswell story. However, on the whole, our
sales are up for the year, due to the massive drop in our system
pricing since May. Today, a Pentium 200 worth $2500 at the
beginning for the year, is selling for under $789. Technology
marches on.
7. Is the placement of the history in the site of ACC a
marketing play for promote the visitation to the site?
REPLY: We wish there were some benefit to us for having
promoted the story with our website. If anything, our handling
of the matter may have contributed to our image as being a
"people oriented" business. The thousands of people who came to
our website simply visited the pages relating to Roswell, and
then left. How did that benefit us? It didn't. Did it benefit
the public?
Certainly, as the story would never have seen the light of day
in the first place, if we had not publicized it. Do we deserve a
Nobel Peace Prize, as some have suggested: We do not think so,
not for this. It still is our hope that we get to the bottom of
this, rather than that the story end here, with the DoD having
admitted to irregularities in their story, and with the NASA
Astronauts insisting ACC's story is true. There is no reason to
believe that we will be able to convince anyone anything, unless
we can definitively announce that we have found the remains of
the
Roswell UFO.
8. Did ACC try to review the data that it obtained for
confirmation for specialists and exempted researchers?
REPLY: In our opinion, there are NO researchers in the
UFO Investigations Field presently equipped to cope with the
enormity of this story, it is way to big for any one small group
of researchers to deal with, particularly the parts involving,
allegedly, Bell Laboratories and the cultural history of the
Bell System.
We presented the story on our Web
site, partly in hopes of finding the Investigation Community
open to doing exactly what you have asked, but the results were
not as we anticipated: to date, aside from skeptics, NONE OF
WHOSE ALLEGATIONS have succeeded in refuting the story, the
representatives of Bell, Motorola and the IEEE, who failed to
provide any real evidence that refutes the Transistor aspects,
and the representatives of the estates of Earl Lilienfield,
Jack
Morton, and the various parties from learned research
facilities, who have done nothing but confirm most of the
allegations, the answer is: where do you believe we should TURN
next?
9. Do you believe in flying saucers and extraterrestrial
life?
REPLY: The term "flying saucer" is a misnomer referring
to "alien spacecraft", presumably. ACC can neither confirm, nor
deny the existence of either. However, employees of the company
are a lot less skeptical today, than they were when the story
first surfaced on our website in July. We are engaging in a
point by point recreation of exactly what happened during the
past 5 months at this time, to see if we missed anything.
It is difficult to tell what we
believe, right now, because in the course of recreating things,
we followed a lead that has convinced us we know exactly where
the remains of the so-called UFO from Roswell are. We are also
intent upon pointing out to the public that the term UFO was
invented by a dilemma expert, who noted that a UFO could never
be "identified", because then it would be an IFO. We believe the
Roswell UFO, is, in reality, an IFO.
IT's identity will have to be proven, before we will further
publicize it. Furthermore: we have isolated about three distinct
teams of personnel of the National Security Agency who have been
laying down a steady stream of false Information in the ET
Investigation Community for the past 25 years, since the days
the Starpoint investigation surfaced in the midst of the Bell
System, after Jack Morton was murdered.
They are almost single handedly
responsible for maintaining a cloud of disinformation about the
Roswell matter intended to hide what COULD HAVE BEEN one or more
technology transfer programs involving an other-worldly
species
that contacted the United States Government in 1945, 1947, 1952,
1955, 1963 and later. We believe that if this lead bears fruit,
there will also be a completely different explanation for events
which led up to the end of World War II than has ever been
contemplated before.
The species in question are
euphemistically referred to by the NSA and DoD as the "Time
Skippers", and while, assuming they are real, and we are not
being fed a line of disinformation by snitches we have employed,
they are not exactly
Time Travellers, they are capable of
travelling great expanses of space, in violation of the laws of
Time - in extremely short periods of time, but are still bound
by a law of the natural universe that prevents them from
arriving anywhere "before they started".
They simply skip the time interval,
supposedly, that it would take to travel tens of thousands of
Light Years between stellar systems. They use a technology that
reduces the mass of their craft to Zero, so as to defeat the
laws of space/time. Or so the story goes... We have every reason
to believe that this story is true, and preambles the Roswell
Crash by several years, leading up to the crash and beyond.
10. Do you believe that the transistor was created
starting from the extraterrestrial interference?
REPLY: See prior question.
Just ten questions that will contribute a lot here to the
understanding of the readers of Vig√≠lia in Brazil. At once, we
thanked your valuable collaboration and good will, certain of we
could count with brief answer.
Our more cordial greetings,
REPLY: We hope your readers find the above information
useful. We are right now between a rock and a hard place in
verifying all of the information about the Time Skippers' race
and point of origination, or even whether the entire thing is
not just some kind of NSA ruse to further ruin our effort to
reveal the Truth about Roswell.
If what we have alleged above is
true, it involves matters even more earthshaking than the
original story about the Transistor: it would imply that History
is being molded by our interactions with a Race capable of
traveling back and forth between our Solar System and their
own, in only a few months, and who possess an enormous
intellectual capacity, one about 3 times that of our own, and a
much more well developed "telephathic" or "empathic" ability, or
both.
And, the lead we are following
implies that our two races are genetically related in some way.
We are hopeful that this lead, however slim the possibility that
it is true, pans out, or at least helps us to further evidence
Disinformation plots by Intelligence Agencies, hiding some
sinister secret about Alien matters they simply do not want us
to find out about.
