Introduction
IN THE IMAGE OF THE CREATOR
With this present opening of this third section
of this trilogy on the underlying, practical foundations of the science of
physical economy, we have presented ourselves with the task of untangling
the most crucial of the issues posed by recorded human history, with
emphasis on the history of European civilization from its ancient to modern
times, up to the present day.
This confronts us now, in the form and
implications of the greatest threat to civilization as a whole known to us
in an approximation of systematic terms, from the relatively earliest to
present part of that history. This is also, in part, the history of a social
disease.
That sickness, which now, immediately threatens all mankind with the
gravest, most genocidal collapse of the human species in known times,
confronts us with the heritage of all of those most crucial errors in
generally accepted beliefs which have been accumulated, from the earliest to
present records of organized forms of civilizations, to the present day. The
greatest follies of mankind today lie, therefore, in much of what
conventional beliefs and practices mistreat as virtually axiomatic truths.
The additional paradox is, the immediate practical solution for this crisis,
is relatively elementary, as the reader will discover in the close of this
report, but, the baggage of those cultural traditions which have misled
mankind into this present crisis over millennia to date, must be cleared
away.
So far, Today
In the two preceding parts of this presently continuing series on the
subject of the urgently needed, world-wide scientific revolution called, "a
science of physical economy," I had treated the most essential among the
methodological foundations on which a suitably reformed science of economy
must now be seen as based.
This must be done, if the world is to escape
from the present, virtually terminal breakdown-crisis of the presently
existing form of organization of the world economy as a whole.
In the systemic features of the two preceding elements of this series, our
urgent attention were focused upon the goal of setting forth the
ground-principles of a science of modern physical economy, as such. The
rudiments of those changes are now presented in the course of this, the
third part of the series.
Here, in this part of that series, I converge upon the principles which
underlie the needed, notions of the idea of that set of urgently needed
scientifically revolutionary changes in that concept of "economics," by me,
which is based, entirely, upon the principled notion of physical economy as
such. By that, I mean, particularly, those notions which must be employed to
eradicate the influence the chief current adversary of our United States,
that monetarist system which is, usually, still defined as that of our
republic's most relevant economic enemy, Britain's John Maynard Keynes.
In this present document, the treatment of that,
and closely related subjects, prepares the ground for examining the
structure of the urgently needed new design of that form of an international
credit-system so urgently needed in launching the immediately oncoming
half-century of an operating system for a physical-economic recovery. This
is a recovery to be achieved through cooperation among the majority of the
population of which those sovereign nations of the world is now to be
comprised.1
An actually competent science of modern economy today, is essentially a
matter of the ending of, and replacing of the priority which had been
wrongly placed on what had been, hitherto, an axiomatically incompetent
system, a monetary system.
This has been a modern, specifically European
system which had been rooted in the basis provided by those Liberal
monetarist conceptions of price, such as the scoundrels John Locke, and the
British East India Company's Adam Smith and Jeremy Bentham.
More broadly, the fault of that system has lain
in the system's adopted notion of the function of price, a notion which as
been a vicious, modern expression of what has been, essentially, the same
incompetence built up from both those ancient and, then, the medieval
Venetian varieties of monetarist roots traditionally underlying the
prevalent dogmas of financial accounting practice during the medieval and
modern times, still, as I write here today.
The presently onrushing plunge of our entire planet into what, unless
stopped, will be a prolonged, global new dark age of all mankind. This
contingency requires that we free ourselves from the grip of those
conceptions and practices of the monetarist traditions, traditions which
must now be thoroughly superseded, that systemically, by a science of
physical economy: by the adoption of a notion of physical, rather than
monetary value. This replacement must be in the form of a credit system,
rather than a monetarist system.
This new conception will be a notion of physical value which must be
premised, on all most essential points, on the superseding authority of that
revolution in modern physical science, the authority which will have been
based on the retrospective implications of the unique features of the
discoveries of universal physical principles by Bernhard Riemann,
and, also, based upon the relevant conception which was derived from
Riemann's discoveries by such leading followers of his as Albert Einstein
and Academician Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky, as all the three are
considered in that order, for our purposes here.
Why should nations and their peoples be so foolish, over so many millennia,
as since the Peloponnesian War, as to believe that it were better to be
enslaved to borrowing the essentially fictitious value of a form of money
which has no intrinsic value, since predatory private agencies of usury,
such as ancient the Delphi Apollo cult, or the essentially pure usury of
Keynesian today, rather than, as the U.S. Constitution prescribes, permit
only the creation credit as the debt of sovereign nations derived from no
agency but the government of a sovereign nation-state, or association of
cooperating, but respectively perfectly sovereign nation-state republics?
This present piece, and the background for it presented in its relevant, two
immediate predecessors, are written during a time when all of the presently
customary notions of national and world economy have all become, in and of
themselves, not only immediate, and hopelessly disastrous economic failures,
but systems which, if continued now, would mean the virtual doom of the
present civilization, world wide. In fact, the present crisis of the U.S.
dollar under the monetarist lunacy of the present U.S.
Obama
administration, threatens to be, not the explosive charge which
blows the nations of the planet apart, but is simply the detonator of the
failed world system as a whole, a detonator which brings down the entire
world into a genocidal crisis for all nations, as early as the closing weeks
of this present yearif that administration's lunatic policies are permitted
to be extended during the six or fewer months ahead.
For the sake of the immediate prospect of survival of nations, the practices
of monetarism, which have reigned in "Old Europe," and beyond, can no longer
be tolerated upon this planet since the relevant developments under the
Anglo-American "bail-out" policy rampant since September 2007.
The immediate eradication of monetarist systems,
and their replacement by true credit-systems, such as that central to the
Hamiltonian principle of the U.S. Federal Constitution, must provide this
remedy through which a system of respectively, perfectly sovereign
nation-state republics, is the only reigning system of our planet.
So, to understand the relevant issues posed by the world's presently doomed
financial, monetary, and physical economic systems, we must trace the
particular portion of the recent decades' turbulent history of the U.S.
dollar itself from its condition during the last years of the U.S. Herbert
Hoover Administration, through that economy's rise to a great
physical-economy recovery, from the depths of the Hoover depression, and
during the course of slightly more than three terms under President Franklin
D. Roosevelt.
Although the dollar's later decline to its presently disastrous condition,
was rooted in a succession of down-shifts set into motion, in fact, with the
accession of Roosevelt's successor, President Harry S Truman, and the
subsequent phases of that history, until the present crisis, Truman can
scarcely be blamed entirely for the general decline which followed Truman's
own plausibly treasonous wrecking operations; the U.S. economy itself has
been steered through a succession of phases of what has become, especially
since March 1, 1968, a succession of markedly downward phase-shifts in rate
of decline
Although this present, post-1958 and continued decline began under such
Truman successors as:
-
President Nixon
-
under the
Trilateral Commission and President
Carter
-
under the continuation of the Trilateral
Commission's shaping of the Reagan-Bush Administration
-
under that disgusting, failed Presidency
of
George H.W. Bush, which brought
President Bill Clinton in for two successive terms
-
under the depraved President
George W. Bush, Jr. who secured two
terms through the effects of the Anglo-Saudi complicity in the
mass-murderous, and frankly treasonous "9-11" hoax
-
and, now, the most disastrous of them
all, which has just occurred during little more than a bare six
months, under President
Barack Obama
Nonetheless, despite the fact that that long
wave of decline of the U.S. economy began with the Truman administration,
the worst part of this continuing down-slide, has occurred since that
succession of the increasingly radical, chiefly London-steered changes,
downward, which have ensued since 1968.
Even then, the U.S. dollar had continued to be
unmatched in its role as the dominant factor in the supply of international
credit, up to the most recent, catastrophic developments of 2007-2009. Thus,
the mass of U.S.-dollar-denominated debt, has been the principal source of
the supply of credit on which the world-trade system as a whole had
depended, up to the beginning of the term of President Barrack Obama.
That still presently accelerating full collapse
of the dollar which, is a collapse which is now immediately inevitable,
unless my proposed reforms are instituted; such a collapse would mean the
end of civilization as we have known it since the Fourteenth Century of
Europe's great new dark age.
Shelley On History
In the meantime, if we are to understand that present change for the worst,
which first erupted openly during the close of Spring of 1968, we must turn
our attention, once again, to some crucially important advice respecting
mass behavior, advice which was presented by Percy Bysshe Shelley, in the
concluding, summary paragraph of his
A Defence of Poetry.
Shelly emphasized that a current strain of a nation's history lies in the
"spirit of that age," in a time where a certain underlying, specifically
dynamic quality of subsuming theme, and matching direction of evolution of a
nation's relevant aspect of its evolving culture grips, for better or for
worse, both those who share that sense of direction, but also those who
submit to its sway even despite their otherwise contrary disposition.
This notion, as expressed by Friedrich Schiller,2
as by Shelley after him, is to be appreciated as a complementary expression
of the same notion of physical dynamics which had been introduced to modern
science by Gottfried Leibniz during the 1690s.
Respecting the immediate situation in the U.S.A., and also in Europe and in
Central and South American nations today, that relevant shift in post-1945
culture which actually occurred with the inauguration of Churchill
accomplice Harry S Truman to the U.S. Presidency, also set into motion
long-term trans-Atlantic cultural trends which have persisted since that
time, trends which led, since the late 1960s, into the eruption of a wave of
globally extended, anarchoid fascist (e.g., Dionysiac) "youth revolutions"
in the aftermath of the combined effects of that first step of that breakup
of the Bretton Woods system, which erupted approximately March 1, 1968.
This was the eruption which occurred in the form
of the ensuing, international rioting by specifically fascist currents of
relatively privileged strata on leading university campuses, such as the
pro-fascist, Dionysian, "Weatherman" cult, in the Americas and Europe. To
sum up that 1945-1968 process of what became known as a "cultural
revolution," the sprouting of the dragon's teeth planted under auspices of
President Harry S Truman's pro-imperialist alliance with Winston Churchill,
and harvested in Spring-Summer-Autumn 1968.
In effect, thus, in the case of the U.S.A., what happened over the 1945-1968
interval, and its sequel, brings our attention back to the Homeric Iliad and
the treatment of the consequences of that by the Classical Greek tragedian
Aeschylus, including, notably, his Prometheus Bound. From the vantage-point
of the tradition of the ancient Apollo-Dionysus cult of Delphi, the
Apollonian culture of the modern, British reigning classes, prepared the
swing into a new eruption of that overly pro-Satanic shift to a
pro-Dionysian, drug-sex culture, an eruption which came in the form of the
domination of the population born, with the advent of the post-Franklin
Roosevelt turn under the connivance of Truman with Churchill during
1945-1968 interval.
Out of this, those who emerged as the culturally
privileged anti-Classical cultural Dionysians of the 68ers made their own
cultural revolution, a change in culture through which the dominant
Dionysian "degeneration" strata of that stratum came to dominate most among
the remainder of the same biological generation born during, approximately,
the 1945-1958 interval.
This has been a social factor which is still
dominant in shaping the downward slide into the becoming of that utter
decadence which, since 1968, rules the world up to the moment of the
eruption of the current mass strike process of August in the United States.
There were principally two crucial factors which, in effect, empowered the
process of takeover of control of the evolution of the trans-Atlantic
society from the hands of the generation set into motion by the inauguration
of President Harry S Truman, and, later, in a much more decadent form, by
those "Dionysian" strata of that generation set into motion, not by, but
under President Richard M. Nixon.
-
The first was the sudden change in the
situation of those relatively more privileged university students
who were enraged at being expected, suddenly, to be drafted into a
military service from what they had assumed they were effectively
exempt by very of a special privilege of social status. As a
stratum, they exploded in rage at the society which had "betrayed"
them by revoking the special privilege which they had thought was
implicitly afforded to them. It was, thus, the leading universities
which appeared to serve as the breeding ground for the new, fascist
youth-culture of that time.
-
The second was a Dionysian's specific
sense of having a certain class privilege "by right," the assumption
that they had been exempt from not only military service in foreign
wars, but that these privileges of a special class "belonged to
them," as a caste of the privileged," and that dirty military and
other physical labor was properly relegated to the "lower classes"
of both farmers and "blue collar workers" which were to be
"naturally" presumed to be of a lower class than themselves. They
believed that they, with the support of the underclass of "blacks"
and "hispanics" were to serve as shock-troops to be led, by rage, by
the privileged "upper class" categories of students at certain
universities.
This "68er" stratum, in general, hated actual
science, even, to a significant degree, among many of those those whose
academic credentials were nominally located in physical science and
engineering.
Otherwise, the division of society under the
emerging anti-science "aristocracy," was based on the assumed natural
affiliation of that hatred against "the blue collar classes," a hatred which
was assumed to be shared between the indolent wastrel-class from the
campuses. and the "black" and "hispanic" lumpen-proletariat. The ideology
which bound these forces together intellectually, was composed of types who
adopted their ideology from the fascist existentialism of Theodore Adorno
and Hannah Arendt,3 from the followers of Bertrand Russell
such as Norbert Weiner and John von Neumann, and from the Europe-based
depraved associated with the ideology of the Congress for Cultural
Freedom (CCF).
Those attributes of that "Baby Boomer" generation which rose to a dominant
role under the relevant, pro-fascist tendencies located in certain
clinically definable portions of the 1968-2009 generation, have been, in
part, specific to that generation in respect to many mere particulars; but,
otherwise, they have only echoed the general character of the ebb and flow
of the historically recurring Apollo-Dionysian matrix characteristic of the
imprint of the cult of Delphi led by such creatures as that Delphi priest
and hoaxster Plutarch who shaped the cult of ancient imperial Rome in his
time.
Time and time again, the generation dominated by the cult of worship of the
"68er's" narcissistic image of himself (and until recently, his or her nude
body),4 has plunged civilization into relative dark ages. That is
the essential root and character of the dark age which the evil-doers, such
as Obama and his "behaviorist" crew embody, in their devout service to the
carrying out the Hitler-like evils intended by their master, the British
monarchy's mass-murderous, neo-Malthusian intentions today.
As we used to warn one other back during the 1939-1945 world war: Know your
enemybefore it is too late to fight.
Obama's Threat to
Civilization
So, from both such ancient and modern roots, the disastrous first six months
of that Obama Administration had unleashed a new phase, launching what now
threatens, immediately, to become the greatest global economic catastrophe
in all modern world history: a presently threatened collapse of the world
population, from about 6.7 billions to about two, or fewer, that in a couple
of generations or so, just as the wicked, pro-genocidal intention of both
Prince Philip's World Wildlife Fund and the leading present policies of the
U.S. Obama administration would have it so.
What were the level of the value of to which the U.S. dollar would collapse?
The Obama Administrations own wild expansion of
the Bush Administrations lunatic, predatory policies, have carried this
ruin of the U.S., which was started under Bush in September 2007, into
uncharted domains of an absolute, rather than a merely relative bankruptcy,
during little more than six months to the present date.
Under the effect of such a short-term course
under the previously established conditions of early January 2009, the
entire world system would be plunged into that general dark age for
centuries to come, a dark age expressing a qualitatively worse phase than
already experienced as the physical decline in the world's economy since
1968-2009 to date.5
Thus, for these reasons, without a recovery of the essential factors of
world credit embodied, still, in the U.S. constitutional design for dollar,
there is no visible prospect for an avoidance of the new dark age for any,
or all, of the nations of the planet. For reasons I shall indicate later in
this report, a collapse of the credit-worthiness of the U.S.A. dollar now,
would mean an immediate dark age for all mankind. No presently existing
nation would out-live the collapse of the U.S.A. dollar which the British
empire had arranged through the ministries of the U.S. Bush and Obama
administrations thus far.
Thus, unless the errant, and, actually, not very intelligent, but only a
Nero-like bully for whom spoken words are often merely the sound of
graffiti, President "Barry" Obama, is either replaced soon, or placed under
suitable forms of "adult supervision" which do not impair the legacy of the
intention of our Federal Constitution. Otherwise, there is no hope for a
physical-economic recovery of any part of this planet during the lifetimes
of the adult population of today, or, who knows how much longer.
So, the urgently needed reform which I outline in the course of the
following pages, must be adopted in recognition of the fact, that one of the
greatest threats to civilization, globally, at this time, is revealed by the
historical fact, that the model of the American System of political-economy,
was rooted in the work of the 1620-1687 New England developments, in the
role of Benjamin Franklin, and also Alexander Hamilton's role in the
crafting of the credit-system of the U.S. Federal Constitution.
Unfortunately, in the present age of Dionysos which was established in
trans-Atlantic society in 1968, the constitutional principle of our American
System of political-economy, is, presently, almost unknown among the ranks
of virtually all leading governments of the world, outside a limited, and
still shrinking circle of better educated citizens of our own republic.
That specific lack of competence in matters of
constitutional principles, can be largely traced to the dying out, or
retirement, of most among the rations of World War II veterans presently
still living as formerly incumbent elected officials of the U.S. government,
since, most remarkably, the April 12, 1945 death of President Franklin
Roosevelt and, also, the November 22, 1963 assassination of President John
K. Kennedy.6
So, since the death of President Franklin Roosevelt, and the treacherous
role of President Harry S Truman, the world as a whole has been ruled and
ruined by infection with the dominant role of a systemic form of cultural
disease, a form of imperialism identified as the imperialist, monetarist
tradition of John Maynard Keynes' presentation of his, then pro-Nazi,
September 7, 1936 German-language edition of his properly infamous General
Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.7
Although the so-called "Hamiltonian model" of credit-system, contains the
crucial elements of a remedy for even the present crisis of the U. S. system
as a whole, the fact of matter today, is, that, except for the slightly more
than three terms of the Franklin Roosevelt Presidency, these constitutional
concepts of that American System, as a credit system, rather than a monetary
system, have not been actually practiced, in the full sense, by governments,
in even the U.S.A., since the introduction of the monetarist
Federal Reserve System under those two faithless Presidents
chosen from among the nephews and sons of the Confederacy, Theodore
Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. Consequently, even President Franklin
Roosevelt had been obliged, in his time, to craft a structure which only
approximated the intention of the U.S. Federal Constitution prior to the
infamous Federal Reserve Act, that in a practical way.
Once President Franklin Roosevelt had been
removed from that office, by death, there has been no consistent change in
general direction from that of the pact between Winston Churchill and
President Harry Truman, a change much needed now, for the possibility of any
durable physical-economic recovery of the physical economy of the planet
considered as a whole.
Respecting the U.S.A. itself, it must be said, that although we have still,
presently, a kernel of competent, scholarly economists who have shown
themselves to me as capable of understanding effectively what I have
presented as the legacy of Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Abraham
Lincoln, Henry C. Carey, and Franklin Roosevelt, and also the case of the
Chancellor Bismarck who modeled his great 1877-1890 reform of Germany on
Carey's counsel, there is virtually no remaining comprehension of the
principles involved, among most of the other leading circles of any other
part of the world today, even among the generality of economists of the
United States itself.8
Despite what had been intended as the anti-imperialist, post-war policies,
and related virtual U.S. intentions of President Franklin Roosevelt, British
asset Harry S. Truman had betrayed the United States, that with full,
vicious consciousness of what he was doing, a change effected through,
chiefly, his dirty, virtually treasonous dalliance with the British
imperialist policies of Winston Churchill.
President Roosevelt's own, 1944, anti-Keynesian, Bretton Woods design, had
contained all of the crucial elements of an American System of
political-economy based on a credit-system, for the post-World War II world.
Knowledge of this fact of recent world history has virtually vanished from
ordinary reporting, since the dying out of even most of my own generation,
and of all of those from among preceding generations from among those of our
patriots who had actually participated, as adult citizens, in the war-time
policies and practices of the President Franklin Roosevelt Administration.
The most of the generation of even our citizens
born before August 1945, which are now rare among the such senior leading
positions today, there are relatively few in the role of such as "Baby
Boomers" in the U.S. Congress today, who have, generally, shown either the
comprehension, the ability, or the courage to comprehend the American System
of political-economy expressed by our U.S. Federal Constitution.
Respecting these matters of economic and related policies: only the terrible
shock of the already extant general bankruptcy of a U.S. economy suffering
increasingly under the awful misleadership of such as President
Barack Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, were to be considered as
sufficient to have prompted an actually rational, working majority of the
present members of the U.S. Congress to come to their senses, that out of
nothing less than a sense of sheer desperation.
Thus, the entire planet now hovers at the brink of an onrushing,
generations-spanning dark trough of absolute despair.
Only the sudden and thorough scrapping of the
monetary systems which have reigned over the world since the death of
President Franklin Roosevelt, could provide humanity today an escape from
that presently onrushing New Dark Age whose character would bring the entire
planet rather quickly from a level of about 6.7 billions individuals, to
probably something near the goal of no more than two billions, a goal which
has been demanded from pro-genocidalists such as the late Bertrand Russell
and the sheer, Nazi-like evil of the present World Wildlife Fund of Prince
Philip and the now deceased Prince Bernhard.
Such is the pro-genocidal, Hitler-copied
"health-care reform" uttered by President "Barry" Obama.
The Challenge of
Physical Economy
While it is necessary to continue the use of money as a regulated medium of
exchange within the microcosms of the social process of economy, any useful
definitions of the role of money must abandon those old, systemically failed
definitions which have been formerly taught in schools and universities, and
as presently accredited accounting practice.
There must now be a sudden and sweeping
installation of a new form of an anti-British-imperialist world economy.
This reform must become the medium of the cooperating, perfectly sovereign
nation-states of Eurasia, Africa, and the Americas. That urgently needed
change, will come into existence on the battleground, once the field were
occupied by the elimination of the preceding reign over those now hopelessly
failed, still presently existing nation-states which had been subjugated to
the imperial character of what have been the former monetary systems which
had dominated most of European history since the Peloponnesian War.9
However, this urgently needed change were likely to occur, only if an inner
circle of professional economic competence is created during the very short
"window of opportunity" now, from among relevant leading circle among some
key nations which are still sufficiently free of .British control of the
European system to undertake such urgently needed reforms. For the moment,
this excludes those nations of continental western and central Europe which
were raped, and transformed into virtual British colonies, by the consenting
role of Presidents George H.W. Bush and Francis Mitterrand in
support of Prime Minister Margaret Thatchers crushing of continental
western and central Europe into a mere collection of virtual British
colonies, that under the organized system of empire now known as former
British Prime Minister (and all-around, lying skunk) Tony Blair and his
would-be new world Tower of Babel, a post-Westphalian "Euro" system.
Similarly, the British empire has presently denied Africa the right to
sovereignty. For the moment, the national economies of South and Central
America, are ruined. Only a certain "Big Four," the U.S.A., Russia, China,
and India, represent a potential anti-British combination which embodies a
capability for launching the kernel of a new world system of national
sovereignties, the elimination of all existing international monetary
systems of empire by the establishment of a new credit-system composed of an
alliance of respectively perfectly sovereign powers of the type which
Franklin Roosevelt had intended, had Harry S Truman not betrayed the most
vital, historic interests of the United States..
For this purpose, the preliminary step of urgently needed education to be
taken immediately, is to present an updated presentation of that "Triple
Curve" imagery which I first published in the official, 1996 announcement of
my candidacy for that year's Democratic Presidential nomination.
The current update of that "Triple Curve" has
been presented in three public events, one prior to my July 1, 2009
international webcast, the second during that webcast, and the third on
August 1. The implications of that update, which will have been presented
publicly prior to those events, are to be assumed in what is written here.
[[Illustrations inserted here]]
The crucial change, when it has happened, might
appear to some as minimal, since what I have proposed, is, simply enough to
replace the existing world monetary system, as if by turning on a dime, by a
fixed-exchange-rate alliance of sovereign national credit-systems among a
set of what shall be, respectively, perfectly sovereign nation-state
republics.
Except for the predatory class of speculators,
the changes will all come as sudden relief from what must now be viewed in
retrospect as a great, virtually life-long headache. The feeling will then
be remembered as a strange, at first, but curiously invigorating.
This shall be accomplished by elementary methods
of reorganization in bankruptcy, methods illustrated by the following,
conjectured case.
The Road Up -
Glass-Steagall's Revenge
In putting the U.S.A. itself through an efficient process of general
financial reorganization-in-bankruptcy for this purpose, we shall apply the
famous Glass-Steagall standard to all banks and related institutions.
Those elements which conform to a
Glass-Steagall standard, shall be preserved
under Federal protection in bankruptcy; those items of nominal value which
do not meet a Glass-Steagall-type standard, such as financial derivatives
and their like, are simply wiped from the books of account, on the perfectly
reasonable, truthful presumption, that speculators have gambled with
intrinsically worthless assets on the croupier's table of monetarist lunacy,
have now lost, and, are, therefore, freely subject to risk of even total
financial loss"wipe-out"in that way.
Besides, since we have no use of such inherently useless and despicable
creatures and institutions typified by J. P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and the
like, there is no loss to humanity in a proper elimination of such types of
pestilent relics by the simple act of clearing the decks of their predatory
claims.
Under a credit system consistent with the
embedded soul of our Federal Constitution, we have neither any need of such
parasitical Wall Street institutions, not can be afford to continue to feed
such worthless creatures at the cost of starving our citizens and killing
them with President Obama's intended copy of Adolf Hitler's inherently
murderous with Obama's fraudulent health-care schemes..
Contrary to the opinions of J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and swindlers such
as George Shultz's accomplice Felix Rohatyn, or international drug-trafficking's
George Soros. It the people, and the perpetuation and improvement of
the productive facilities on which their conditions of life depend, which
shall enjoy the absolute priority. Money, other than that uttered entirely
by a sovereign nation-state government of a U.S. partner in the composition
of the new world credit system, were to be treated as, for the moment, a
fiction resembling the "Monopoly Money" of the well-known board-game.
As I proposed during July-September 2007, we
shall defend and save those banks which conform to service of the citizens
of both our republic, and our foreign partners in this undertaking, by
virtue of the intention expressed by a Glass-Steagall standard, that under
the authority of the Preamble of the U.S. Federal Constitution and the
provision of the preceding constitutional principle of Gottfried Leibniz's
the "pursuit of happiness" of the U.S. 1776 Declaration of Independence.
There will be nothing which is actually unfair, or abusive in that ruling.
Those nations which fail to seize the opportunity of participation in a
credit-system proffered by the U.S.A. and its partners in this enterprise,
will be doomed, by their own choice, if they are so stubbornly foolish as to
persist in adhering to the "doomed ship" which that worthless parasite which
a monetary system represents today.
If they accept the change to a credit-system,
then, the message is,
"Welcome aboard! Our credit-system's circles
are not sinking."
There can be no honest, or sane, simple reading
of the history of U.S. Constitutional Law, contrary to that fact.
This is made apparent if and when we examine the
actual histories of our Declaration of Independence and Federal Constitution
on matters bearing on this point respecting the actual constitutional law of
specifically "Hamiltonian" U.S. Federal banking.10 The relevant
points bearing the historical crafting of U.S. banking law under the
guidance of Alexander Hamilton, must be properly recognized for the fact
that the very historical existence of the U.S. Federal Constitution and its
adoption, has depended absolutely upon the need for a Federal Constitution
as the instrument which enabled our republic to defend the existence of our
United States through Federal control and defense of our national credit, as
facilitated through a national banking system.
Our general welfare principle is located
centrally in just that matter at issue, then, as now. The Federal Reserve
System will not actually disappear; it will achieve a certain, curious
semblance of immortality, as a special kind of museum, in a securely
located, and securely locked basement area in the "Hamiltonian" Third
National Bank of our United States.
All Jacksonian and kindred forms of corrupted persons' animus against
national banking, must be located in the relevant, treasonous sources of
influence controlled, through U.S. relics of the British East India Company,
as in Boston and Manhattan, from the time of the traitor Aaron Burr of Bank
of Manhattan notoriety, to the present day of such inveterate scoundrels as
Goldman-Sachs and Larry Summers, each and all robbers-in-fact, who should
not be shielded from what what only a presently lacking decent standard of
law would fail to define as their own more or less criminal proclivities.
The remedies which flow from the considerations which I have just defined in
these paragraphs, have a much more ancient and deeper relevance in the
entirety of the rise and spread of what has been the imperial legacy of a
globally extended European civilization, As I shall emphasize in the course
of the following body of my report here, this relevance is as identified by
the monetarist system centered in the British empire of London's financial
center today.
In this report, from here on, two general rules of discussion must be
accepted, and kept in mind.
-
First, there is no reasonable hope for
the continued existence of any national economy which declines the
proffer of joining my proposed credit-system based on the principle
of the American System. Any effort to cling to a monetary system, is
comparable to having had oneself locked in, from the outside, within
a cherished stateroom, in an already sinking ship; the present world
monetary system is already a ship ready to take its terminal plunge,
perhaps as soon as the October 2009 U.S. payments crisis..
-
Second, there is no possible rescue of
nations from the presently ongoing disintegration of the world's
monetary systems, except through a form of reorganization in
bankruptcy conforming to the historical, Hamiltonian precedent of
the U.S.A. Constitution's principled design of a credit-system; the
old monetarist body-organ is dead, and must be removed for the sake
of the living body.
As I have noted in recently circulated reports
on these matters, the change to a credit-system, does not mean an automatic
replacement of currencies (excepting the hopeless case of the
London-controlled monetary torture-chamber of continental Europeans known as
the ruinous Euro).
It means a process of reorganization of
financial economies-in-bankruptcy, in which only those values corresponding
to the likeness of a dollar-based credit-system will be honored. The case of
a Glass-Steagall standard for defining categories of legitimate assets under
credit-system, is exemplary.
The goal must be the creation of an
international, fixed-exchange-rate credit-system. The objective of that
process of transformation from a monetary system, to such a credit-system,
is the purging the system of intrinsically worthless, speculative financial
debt, by purging it from the accounts of all nations, while, nonetheless,
preserving those nominal values which would qualify for the application of
the equivalent of an historical, U.S.A. Glass-Steagall standard.
The claimed assets, now denominated internationally in monetary terms, will
be checked by the proceedings in bankruptcy organization. Those claims which
meet a Glass-Steagall standard will be placed in a compartment where they
are transformed, as if instantly, from monetary assets into newly protected
assets under a credit system.
The rest with be re-examined for prospective
membership in the same pigeon-hole, under our law, with Confederate bank
notes, or the I.O.U.'s amassed by an ordinary, extinct gambling house.
The owner of those assets which will continue to
be used as money, is the same sovereign nation-state which had had the
legitimate title to those national assets when they had been considered part
of the basis for a national currency of a particular monetary system. It is
only the ridding of the system of properly debridable, fictitious assets,
such as the essentially fictitious, Keynesian form of gambling debts
sometimes known as "financial derivatives," which has been "victim" of the
write-off.
The change must be a moment of rubato in the music of international economy,
as the example of President Franklin Roosevelt's "bank holiday" reform
illustrates the purpose of such a transformation.
The New World
Credit-System
The guiding light in this operation, is defined by the urgency of uttering
vast amounts of nation-state-created, long-term credits, credits uttered for
the purpose of creating production of physical assets, that done through the
cooperation of a concert of sovereign nations operating, in significant
part, through what had been chartered national and state chartered private
banks operating within the bounds of credit-systems, rather than monetarist
systems.
These chartered private banks, operating within
the framework of relevant, sovereign national credit systems, will operate
within a global environment of international credit defined by treaty
agreements among respective nation-state sovereigns, for immediate
productive investment (and related physically productive employment). That
change must be designed for the immediate purpose of terminating the process
of present monetary-driven, general physical economic collapse of the planet
in general.
International credit created for this purpose,
must be integrated into a global set of fixed-exchange-rate systems, to such
effect that there are no significant fluctuations which would upset a
systemic form of exchangeable basic lending-rate among the participating
sovereign nation's within the simple annual base-rate rate range of 1.5-2.0%
for purposes including long-term formation of physical capital.
No continued existence of the inherently predatory and usurious institutions
of a monetary system will enjoy permission to operate within the new
international credit-system constituted by treaty-agreement systems of
relationship among perfectly sovereign, respective nation-state republics.
The regulation of prices and trade must define adopted valuations adduced
from long-term physical investment.
This regulation echoes a practice which was the
typical implication of the U.S.A.'s economy under its best periods of
long-term net physical growth, per capita and per square kilometer, or, as
in the case of those Bismarck reforms during the 1877-1890 interval, which
were based on the counsel of U.S. economist Henry C. Carey, and on related
historical examples in modern European experience since the reforms made
under the A.D. 1439 Great Ecumenical Council of Florence.
Bismarck's model was based on a view of the
policies of Carey and President Lincoln especially those precedents bearing
upon the establishment of the U.S.A. as a credit-system.
That was the U.S. credit-system defined by the
U.S. Federal Constitution, as this was launched in that form, under the
influence of the man who became that republic's first Secretary of the
Treasury, Alexander Hamilton.
So much for the rules of long-term loans under the new, international system
of lending of credits within a fixed-exchange-rate credit-system which will
replace, entirely, the world's existing or proposed monetary systems.
So much for John Maynard Keynes' money.
Henceforth, from this point on, in presenting the definitions of the
required reform of the new world system, in this report, I defer the matter
of prices until a point after we have considered the physical principles
underlying, and thus governing the operation of the new international
credit-system.
The Work of the
Creator
In the two reports of this series which precede this present one, I have
already shown, that the definition of competent principles of a science of
physical economy, is in conformity with that continuing development of the
Riemannian physics which is expressed by the pioneering accomplishments of
Albert Einstein and Academician V.I. Vernadsky.
My emphasis, there, has been on the ordering of
the general phase-spaces, which I treated in the order of the succession
from the ostensibly abiotic domain, to the relatively higher of domain, the
Biosphere, and, thence, to the still higher order of existence, the
Noösphere. The notion of economic value as physical value, is so defined,
thus, in a new way, in contrast to the inherently misleading manner of
denoting capital assets fictitiously, as under the reign of monetary
systems.
In other words, the evidence underlying that ordering, signifies that the
Earth's abiotic mass is a subject of the action upon it by the Biosphere,
and that the Biosphere, in turn, is a subject of the development of the
planet by, chiefly, the action of the Noösphere upon it. The principle
defining the Noösphere, is the expression of: those creative powers of the
human will, the which are absent, in a conscious form, in all living species
other than the individual personality of each member of mankind. In
principle, those powers of creativity are to be located in respect to what I
have identified as category "B" personal identities, in the preceding two
sections of this series of reports11.
In a Riemannian universe in which that noëtic principle and its
configurations exists as an efficiently physical agency, there can be no
actual existence of an Aristotelean or comparable, pre-determinable,
ontological notion of completeness in physical science, or otherwise.
Such was the celebrated argument, for theology, by Philo of Alexandria,
against Aristotle's and Friedrich Nietzche's virtual "God is dead" dogma.12
Such is the key to recognizing that essential fraud embodied in the a-priorist
hoax of Euclidean geometry. Such is the implication of the argument against
reductionist mathematics by such modern followers of Nicholas of Cusa, as in
the case of that discovery of universal gravitation which was unique to the
work of Cusa's follower Johannes Kepler, and for Gottfried Leibniz's
definition of the ontologically infinitesimal.
Such was the issue implicitly settled by the
failed efforts to define "completeness," as by Göttingen's David Hilbert.
Such is the implication of the crucial principle of the work of Albert
Einstein, in opposition to the positivist followers of Ernst Mach and, also
the much more depraved Bertrand Russell. Our universe never was, and never
will be completed within finite time with respect to the efficient
principles which it contains, and which, in turn, contain it, at least
temporarily.
The proof for this understanding of the nature of the human species'
individual member, lies in matters pertaining to the interrelated notions of
creativity and human identity in the two relevant preceding publications. I
refer to the discussion of the matter of functional distinction between, as
I indicated there, on the one side, the crude, simplistic, and mistaken form
of the human sense of identity which I described as sense of identity "A,"
as distinguished from that of the healthy mind, by aid of reference to the
cases of Percy Bysshe Shelley (or, Friedrich Schiller), and Albert Einstein,
with sense of identity "B."
The unique power of increase of our human
species' potential relative population-density, by creative discoveries of
principles by individuals, as measurable per capita and per square kilometer
of the Earth's surface, and the rise of the population, thus, from near that
of higher apes to approaching 6.7 billions today, proves the superior
quality of power of the human individual over all lower forms of life, but
also demonstrates that still greater power of the Creator which has preceded
our appearance.
The Creator of the universe is not "dead." Man and woman are distinguished
from all beasts, as they are made in the likeness, potentially that of case
"B," of the Creator. Such is the lesson of the essential evidence of the
known, continuing history of human life.
Such is the lesson on which all competent
notions of economy, contrary to the Nazi-copied health-care policies of the
perverted President Barack Obama, but faithful to all true notions of human
morality, depend absolutely, today.
The "Green Death" Is
Here!
Any possible avoidance of a general, physical breakdown of the economy of
the planet as a whole, depends upon the prompt adoption of certain radically
new ways of thinking which will be a break with those beliefs and practices,
by governments and the people of their nations, generally.
This will be an urgent turn, away from those
deeply ingrained habits of belief and behavior which have, in some respects,
caused; or, on other accounts, have been simply tolerated under conditions
of the present slide of the planet as a whole into the presently onrushing
new dark age. It is urgent that nations, especially re-think their own
recent mental habits in these matters.
The most crucial, and cruel economic fact of the present situation is,
chiefly, the effect of those changes which produced a post-Franklin
Roosevelt trend in Europe and the Americas. The most most notable among the
direct causes for the panic of mass insanity which grips the economic
policy-shaping of most of the world today, especially Europe and the
Americas, is the sudden shift in social dynamics which was unleashed during
the Spring and Summer of 1968.
That was a change in social dynamics of policy-shaping of societies as
wholes, with the superseding of the dominant role in cultural patterns set
by my own generation, by the youth movement of the anarchoid currents among
the "68ers."
It was a shift in dynamics of policy-shaping
trends in mass behavior, a shift into what the archetypically proto-fascist
Friedrich Nietzsche had trumpeted as his intended shift from the already
amoral, "the Apollonian" to the frankly Satanic, "Dionysian" fascism
expressed, typically, by the circles of Mark Rudd during the 1968-69
interval.
That moral depravity has been continued to the present day, as the "green
death" of "post-industrial," anti-nuclear-power ideology spread from that
Dionysian (e.g., "Satanic") currents among the "68ers" which has transformed
what would have, otherwise, become only a new deep world economic
depression, into what is presently a global "breakdown-crisis" which has
already doomed the continued existence of those ideas respecting economy
which had characterized the economies of the Americas and Europe, most
notably, prior to the dionysiac eruption of the "68ers."
For a deeper insight into this factor of change of cultural direction in the
world economy today, read Percy Bysshe Shelley's A Defence of Poetry.
Concentrate on the concluding paragraph of that publication. Just as the
dynamics of a new Renaissance, such as that launched during the latter half
of Europe's Eighteenth Century around the figures of Gotthold Lessing, Moses
Mandelssohn, and the American Revolution.
This was the movement of the spirit and of
science which drew even what were many otherwise unlikely heroes into the
great changes which the American Revolution generated during the
Nineteenth-century rise of the productive powers of labor in European
civilization.
Now, with the "68ers," we have the expression of the influence of that
spirit of evil which the advent of the dionysiac variety of "68ers" has
represented. So, the dynamic effects of the reign of the dionysiac evil
expressed by the crazed stratum among the "68ers," has transformed even what
had been impassioned patriots of civilization into "neo-malthusian"
instruments of perversion and of destruction of that which those persons
would have, otherwise, prized the most in a saner mental environment.
Thus, similarly, in an earlier time, those seeds of the self-destruction of
both the post-Franklin Roosevelt U.S.A., and also the post-World War II
Americas and Europe generally, were already lain as a pattern since the
combined effects of such developments as the ouster of Chancellor Bismarck
in 1890 and the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901.
However, the "dragon seeds" of the present world
crisis were planted with the birth, during post-war 1945-1958 period of what
became the middle class dionysian rioters of Spring-Summer 1968, into the
1960s and 1970s. So, the destruction of civilization generally, which began
openly as the Dionysian riots begun during the late Spring of 1968, were the
treason against civilization already embedded in the soil of Europe and the
Americas born, like cuckoo-eggs who were delivered by agencies such as the
morally depraved European Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), or, in the
U.S.A., by existentialists such as the evil Theodor Adorno and Hannah
Arendt, who flew in from the Frankfurt School, to deliver their adopted
hatchlings into the American Liberal nests, during the 1945-1958 interval.
It is the "greenies" of today who typify the rebirth of what only seemed to
have ended, like mythical "dragons' teeth," when Adolf Hitler died,
I. ECONOMY AS HUMAN ANTI-ENTROPY
The current celebration of the landing of
astronauts on the Moon, four decades ago, has reminded us of certain
important realities from better times past, times when history had not yet
fallen fully into the combined moral and intellectual decadence of the
"68ers" which, for the moment, has reigned much too long in our nation's
capital of today.13
The most striking of the happy effects produced
by this recent reappearance of the astronauts on stage, forty years after
the manned Moon landing, is the illustration of the principle, that to
conquer the present, we must come as travelers to that better world, and
that truer human species which dwells, by intention, in the future of all
mankind. This is a future which is expressed in a continuing general warfare
against the reign of cheap, greedy, and foolish opportunism. and of its
banalities.
To overcome the decadence, and cheap banalities of the present age of "the
Emperor Petroleum"and, now, worse, even more depraved, obsessions of the
present moment, we must proceed, upward, from mastery of the challenge of a
technology which had already reached the higher energy-flux densities of
nuclear fission. To master fission, we must proceed from a dedication to the
mastery of thermonuclear fusion. To master fusion, we must unveil the
concept of the higher orders of energy-flux-density of what we foresee today
under the rubric of "matter/anti-matter reactions."
To conquer the problems which challenge Earth
from within our Solar system, we must first reach the Moon. The proximate
motive of landing on the Moon, is to open up a manageable, if still
relatively preliminary system of fission-powered, and fusion-powered travel,
from the Moon to the orbit of Mars, as I committed us to locate our
achievement there in my half-hour 1988 network television broadcast, The
Woman On Mars. To achieve that, we must descend from the lunar orbit of
Mars, to establish an operating mission on that planet itself. 14
To achieve that, we must adopt the mission of
colonizing within the inner region of our Solar System, and, after that,
beyond.
To do any of these things, and much more, we must recognize the depravity of
those nominal scientists, and others, who, like baboons, avow their
intellectually and morally depraved, essentially Satanic commitment to their
worship of the notion of universal entropy. Reaching successively higher
orders of energy-flux density, is not a wishful yearning for something
beyond what we are today; it is a desire which already expresses, within us
now, the essential distinction of a faithfully human personality from the
beasts.
It is the difference which separates those devoted to being human beings,
from depraved creatures such as the World Wildlife Fund's Prince Philip, and
the depraved Bertrand Russell before him. Mankind's distinction from the
beasts, is man's creativity as such. Mankind's greatest successes lie in the
process of actually achieving an eternal tomorrow within its own intentions,
a tomorrow beyond anything and everything we were capable of becoming during
the short-to-middle-term today. To be less than that, is to fail to realize
that spiritual quality of a truly moral mankind which is beyond the reach of
the higher apes.
As we should know, the Children of Satan, like the followers of Dostoevsky's
Grand Inquisitor, like those most evil men of the Twentieth Century who have
been typified by relics such as Bertrand Russell and Britain's Prince
Philip, have always hated Prometheans cast in devotion to the likeness of,
and to the mission assigned by our Creator. So, as Philo of Alexandria
rightly blamed Aristotle for this, there are those evil persons who have,
like Britain's Prince Philip, hated God more than anything else.
Such considerations are the foundation upon which knowledge of a competent
science of economy depends absolutely. On this account, I have understood
the strategic meaning of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, in what I have
recognized as the folly of my parents' world since childhood, the folly of a
world in which the true Satan wore a British crown, as did the fictional
"Scratch" of Stephen Vincent Benet's later The Devil and Daniel Webster, as
we may see in Dostoevsky's earlier portrayal of a Grand Inquisitor, still
today.
For one like me, still today, Satan in America
had come to be reared also in the close of Seventeenth-century New England,
where he would come to be worshiped, in my lifetime's experience, by all who
would be willing to defame those Winthrops and Mathers who had typified the
planting of the true seedlings of our republic.
As my late friend and collaborator, the
historian H. Graham Lowry has described this,
All Americans who have reached a fuller
appreciation of what we actually represent as true citizens of our
republic, have grasped the essence of the principle which we must
recognize in the same patriotic devotion to the future of mankind which
has been expressed in an exemplary fashion by the faithful astronauts
from among the citizens of my own generation.
This being true, consider what remains as the
known residue left behind for us in our consciousness of ancient social
processes of mankind. Consider this as it is described for us by mankind
itself, until now. Consider it insofar as we know the actually recorded
evidence of an actually willful form of history up to the present time. So,
that subject of what is still, reasonably, termed "economy," confronts us,
still, today. The notion is not perfect, but is at least a fair
approximation as to essentials.
That knowledge of history confronts us with the net outcome of three
qualitatively distinct, but dynamically interacting, phase-spatial
categories of phenomena.
In the order from the highest rank, to the
lowest, there are:
-
Mankind as what Academician V.I.
Vernadsky defined as the willfully acting agent of the Noösphere;
-
The interaction of mankind, as ruler,
within the habitat usually considered to be the subject of man's
action as economy, also known as both the Biosphere and its overlap
with what is often defined as the lower, abiotic origins of that
aspect known as the Lithosphere;15
and that ancient and present foe of mankind and nature, alike:
-
The dominant role, over the planet in
the large, of that general category of social systems properly
recognized, from the mists of ancient civilizations, to the present
time, as empires, a category which is typified for history generally
by all monetarist systems of Europe since the role of the Temple of
Delphi's role in the Peloponnesian War and the lying Delphic high
priest Plutarch's role in shaping the characteristics of the Roman
Empire in his own lifetime.
The effect of the interaction among these three
phase-spaces, is subsumed in the same way I have emphasized, repeatedly, as
the expression of the Leibnizian principle of dynamics as outlined, in fact,
by Percy Bysshe Shelley in his A Defense of Poetry (as also by the
ancient Pythagoreans and Plato, by Gottfried Leibniz in the 1690s, and by
such crucial followers of Bernhard Riemann's revolutionary reform in
physical science as Albert Einstein and Academician V.I. Vernadsky). It was
always so in matters of universal principle, categorically, for mankind's
existence on our planet.
However, the true nature of the effects we associate with economic
processes, have been masked, until the present time, by the role of what
are, in fact of practice, supranational forms of imperialist systems, as
typified by what had been, originally, the specifically
Europe/Mediterranean-based monetarist systems which have been operating
since the time of the Peloponnesian War.
What is most important about today's immediate
world situation, is that the self-inflicted breakdown of the present,
London-centered imperialist, world system, the present, globalized,
monetarist system, has produced a kind of global crisis to such effect that
no form of civilization could exist on this planet today as long as the
world were still dominated by the efforts to continue the present
increasingly decadent, global, monetarist system.
These agents of the imperialism presently
centered in London are the worshippers of the god of the character "Iago"
from the soliloquy of the revised version, by Arrigo Boito, of Guiseppe
Verdi's Othello. It is not until you understand the essentially satanic
quality of the reigning cynicism of the British empire in these terms, that
your view of current world history gains a semblance of actual strategic
competence.
We are, therefore, presently obliged to reexamine, and remedy as necessary,
those exact same assumptions which had passed for the notion of a world
economy of interacting monetary systems, up to the point of the
post-July-September outbreak of the presently onrushing, monetarist, general
breakdown-crisis of the entirety of the world-wide, essentially British
imperialist form of monetarist system of economy in the large.
We must now scrap the generally accepted, but
worse than useless categories of "economics" which have thus dominated the
world up to the point of this present world breakdown-crisis, especially
since Truman succeeded Franklin Roosevelt. We must now discover what has
been always true about economies, but has been a truth concealed by denials
which express the widespread faith in those notions of the monetarist forms
of world economy which have now reached a concluding stage of that system's
decadence, a stage in which the continued existence of civilization urgently
demands the now prompt elimination of those delusions concerning economy
which were widely taught and believed, both in leading universities and the
relevant leading portions of the governments and populations of the world.
When my report on these matters has been more fully registered as knowledge
among the relatively few, but crucially relevant, competent economists in
the world presently, it will be gratefully acknowledged by them, that the
needed radical changes in view of the subject of economy, are not to be
properly regarded as mystifying.
They may been rarely understood, even among
leading specialists; but, a crucial section among leading economists and
related historians, has shown itself capable of understanding the principles
of the urgently needed qualitative reformand so could you, if you really
tried. The shadows of the old categories of the relatively competent
economists of the presently emerging new era will be readily understood
among those economists and related professionals, old fellows, if admired,
are ironically so, with a certain, empyreal kind of sense of humor expressed
about this entire subject
The objective now immediately before us in this location, is to reexamine
those points from the vantage-point of the experimental evidence which is
now to be viewed, once more, from the standpoint of what I have identified,
in the earlier parts of this series of reports, as sense of personal
identity "B."
So, on that account, in presenting those remarks just made, I do not intend
to deny that, from the contrasted sense of what is, qualitatively, the
morally inferior choice of sense of personal identity "A," there has been a
prevalent, misleading presumption of a certain degree of correspondence to
what was usually practiced in the abused name of "economics" among leading
modern European and related cultures until now. This has included both the
general rules of thumb taught as "economics" by both, what Lord Byron might
have wished to do, had he lived long enough, to portray the British
economists and their Marxist admirers in the lusty style of Byron's English
Bards and Scotch Reviewers..
The "facts" were "facts" in the sense that qualified specialists employed
them as what passed for practicable, "rule-of-thumb" notions of the quality
of crude accounting practices presented in Charles Dickens' portrayal of the
character Uriah Heep. Now, however, the time for that formerly habituated
sort of approach to mere accounting, has ended, probably for all present and
future times within this present Solar System we inhabit.
Henceforth, what can be regarded as economics by
sane leading circles of nations, will now be rescued, and therefore
radically redefined, that along the lines which I shall outline here again,
in due course, some few pages ahead, that from the standpoint of the
implications of what I have identified earlier as sense of identity "B."
The notion of the argument to be made on account of the case for a notion of
universal anti-entropy in human behavior, is conveniently illustrated, as an
argument, by certain broad implications of what is known as the "periodic
table" of both physical chemistry, and, in broader terms, a physical
bio-chemistry.
This argument was carried to what can be
estimated as its highest point by the influence of the work of what was the
person which future history will probably esteem as the most important
intellect of the history of the Academy of Sciences of Russia and Ukraine,
Academician V.I. Vernadsky.
That is to say, that there can be no fixed form of technology in any culture
which represents a durably viable organization of human habitation. Man must
accept the fate of creating his own habitat, here or in whichever part of
our immediate galaxy, or beyond, we inhabit, in that due course of times
which overtake us.
The First Principle of
Physical Economy
To wit, we have the following restatement of points made in earlier parts of
this present series.
The resources on which human existence has depended thus far, have been
concentrated, largely, in residues left as the product of the deceased
living processes of plant and animal life.
There is no significant indication that the
root-amount of the physical-chemical resources of those types has recently
increased significantly in total, except through action by living processes
as such, or human interventions; rather, the weighty evidence is, that these
deposits left by a long-term accumulation of what are now deceased residues
of life-forms, have provided us access to a certain physically-economically
favorable concentrations of the relevant mineral resources, as presently
listable from illustrative reference to relevant details respecting
currently known isotopes of the Periodic Table.
As mankind increases the rate and numbers of the
human population, and as human scientific and technological progress
increases our rates of consumption of raw materials, per capita and per
square kilometer, the happiness of man's continued existence depends upon
forms of technological progress expressed as required forms of qualitatively
higher levels of energy-flux-density per capita and per square kilometer of
inhabited territory of the planet, or in the other parts of the Solar System
or the wider galaxy which our Solar system present occupies..
Consider the "energy" hoax of today.
Many politicians, and others, speak with a pretended grave solemnity about
"principles of energy." For the most part, in the Congress and elsewhere,
they have actually no competent sense of what they are talking around and
about with such affected solemnity.
They exhibit no comprehension of the crucial
notion of what terms such as "power" signify; they usually express a
pomposity which increases in direct proportion to the increase of their
ignorance contained within what they utter as their opinions in this domain.
In fact, these foolish people are predominantly, like the circles of
President Barack Obama, the brainwashed dupes of that fascistic,
pro-genocidal Prince Philip's World Wildlife Fund, which is the agency
chiefly responsible for every really important, actually Satanic evil
rampant and rabid among nations today, including the dupes of the utter,
anti-scientific, pro-genocidal fraud of that New Tower of Babel cult known
as "cap and trade.".
Therefore, speaking now in the relatively simplest, but nonetheless
competent terms of reference, the ability of mankind to maintain human life
at even a constant level of population and standard of living, requires us
to progress continuously to higher levels of effective energy-flux density
in our methods of producing even currently achieved standards of living.
This requirement is typified by the obligation
to proceed from relatively lower to higher sources of power, and to more
advanced physical chemistries. This requirement is also expressed in the
correlated form of an obligation to increase the capital intensity of
productive and related modes of existence, per capita and per square
kilometer of net inhabited territory. This requires a steady rise in what is
manifest as the net energy-flux density of not only the modes of production
of society, but, also, of the conditions of life of the productive society
as a whole.
Although this signifies what must be done even to "stand still," it also,
actually, requires an increase in the numbers of productively living human
individuals as a correlative of maintaining what would appear, in effect, to
be a constant level of a human standard of living. If we stand back, better
to see the implications of what I have just said, the opening chapter of the
Mosaic Genesis 1 comes to mind.
This considered, as I have just described it, contains the essence of any
presently competent physical science of human economy. The properly required
objective of economic policy-shaping is to administer the process of
development of the physical economy of the planet (and beyond) in the manner
required to perform that just-stated mission which is uniquely specific to
the assigned eternal mission of humanity.
This must be restated, therefore, as follows. This brings us to the second
principle of a science of physical economy, that of creativity.
What Is Human
Creativity?
The essential expression of a systemic distinction between the reproduction
of human life, from that of lower forms of life, is located in the
functional distinction of human creativity from animal creativity.
Evolution to higher forms of animal and plant
life is expressed as if simply characteristic of each; but, in animal life
and and plant life, it is an involuntary expression of living species in
general; in mankind, it has a voluntary expression which is independent of
biological development of a species, the human species. This distinction of
the human individual from all lower forms of life is, implicitly, the
distinction shared by man and woman, according to Genesis 1.
This brings us, again, to a central point in the two preceding sections of
this present series: the specifically voluntary quality of human individual
creativity, a creativity which is categorically distinct from the kind of
"involuntary" biological creativity common to lower forms of life.
Nonetheless, neither the parallels, nor the qualitative differences among
creativity among inanimate, human, and inferior forms of living orders and
species, ought to surprise readers of Genesis 1; the term Genesis is an
appropriate choice of synonym respecting its connotations bearing upon that
process of creation which subsumes all existing expressions of our universe.
In Genesis 1, the universal deity is a Being which expresses a willful
quality of sovereign creativity per se: a quality of willfulness, in the
likeness of the essential nature of the Creator, which is presently known to
be shared only with the individual members of the human species.
It is useful, at this particular point, to address the notion of entropy.
As I had emphasized in the earlier segments of this present series of
reports on the subject of a science of physical economy, the only empirical
evidence which has been alleged in support of a general theory of entropy,
such as that of the argument made by the hoaxsters Rudolf Clausius and
Hermann Grassmann, the latter dogma, called empiricism, was a specific
outgrowth of Paolo Sarpi's supplying the premises for what became known as
the modern, more popular version of the philosophical Liberalism of Locke,
as this was copied in the Newton cult created by the followers of Rene
Descartes, as minted for Eighteenth-century Europe by such as Abbe Antonio
S. Conti and Voltaire, by the Physiocrats, by Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham,
Laplace, and Augustin Cauchy, a cult of empiricism which was based, in turn,
on a mangled version of the borrowed, anti-scientific premises of a medieval
irrationalist, William of Ockham.
So, the specific point to be emphasized by me here, is that human creativity
does not exist within the bounds of an axiomatic mathematics, nor a
mathematical physics derived from the axioms of reductionist mathematics; it
exists in man's knowledge, primarily, in the general domain of the
imagination commonly referenced to, and typified by Classical poetry, and in
the perfection of the concept of music which was set into motion by Johann
Sebastian Bach.16
The relevant, broader, European cultural origin of the delusion known as
universal entropy, is indicated in Plato's systematic attack on such
depravity as that in his Parmenides, a systemic error typified by the
Aristotelean tradition of the Delphi Apollo-Dionysos cult, as this tradition
is typified in a most relevant way by the case of that systemic fraud best
known as Euclidean geometry.
The assumption, that the core of belief can be
confined to a set of a-priori presumptions, which are, in turn, presumed to
underlie completely a system of deduction, defines the problem, the
mistaken, a-priori notion of mathematical "completeness," a subject which
much occupied the attention of Göttingen's David Hilbert, then, during the
opening of the Twentieth Century. It was that widely distributed,
long-standing cult-belief, a belief in a notion of an a-prioristic notion of
deductive/inductive "completeness," which has been the sole, clinically
interesting source of the vicious delusion known as "the second law of
thermodynamics."17
Notably, this same rejection of the implicitly pro-Euclidean notion of
completeness of a-prioristic conjectures, has occupied a leading place in
the entire argument denouncing "completeness," as presented by me in the two
preceding pieces of this present series on the subject of a science of
physical economy.
The entirety, of my argument to that effect in
those preceding locations, is to be resumed here, but, with certain
essential kinds of additional considerations also taken into account: as now
follows.
As I emphasized in the earlier two sections of this present trilogy, there
are two most essential features of the function of sustainable growth of an
economy, per capita and per square kilometer.
-
The first is the ontological quality of
the creativity of the human individual, which is located not within
the bounds of a formal mathematical physics, but in those creative
powers of the human mind which exist (functionally) only in the form
of Classical artistic creativity as best typified by the modern
legacy of Johann Sebastian Bach: any music, or poetry contrary to
that principle of Bach, today, is effectively a form of clinical
insanity, if not merely depravity.18
-
The second is the matter of "the
location" of the aspect of the human cognitive processes upon which
competent physical science, as much as Classical poetic and musical
composition depends, which are associated with what I have treated
as "Type B," as in the preceding section of this present series of
reports.
I refer to what is to be described as, that
force of the specific quality of passion associated with that notion of
Classical irony, which prompts the actually civilized person's moral sense
of contempt for anything being expressed according to the dogma of the New
York Times' style book.
The rather substantial number and quality of
references to the role of Albert Einstein's violin in supplying creative
irony and correlated passion to his work as a scientist, should prompt the
thinking reader of this report to develop insight into what I mean as the
experience of the action of scientifically valid expressions of creativity
which depends equally upon Classical artistic development as much, or more
than formal scientific experiment as such.
It is the beauty and passion expressed by Classical poetry, especially
great, moving Classical compositions rooted in the discoveries of Johann
Sebastian Bach, which is the typical location of the specific quality of
passion to which actual human creativity is confined, especially including
scientific creativity. It is the impassioned expression of creativity, as
inspiration, in Albert Einstein's violin, which typifies the origin of the
creativity which gives life to what is otherwise poor, inherently dead
mathematics.
The case of Johannes Kepler's uniquely original, and uniquely valid
discovery of the principle of universal gravitation, in his The Harmonies of
the Worlds, is a most appropriately typical expression of this equivalence
of Classical-artistic and valid scientific thinking.
Or, it should be said, that an Augustin Cauchy,
or a pair like Rupert Clausius and Hermann Grassmann, are clear-cut examples
of reductionist mathematicians who have no competent sense of Leibniz's
actually original discovery of the calculus, as the work of Leibniz or
Riemann must be contrasted with the hoaxes of the Newtonians, Cauchy,
Clausius, and Grassmann.
So, those reductionists who fall within the categories of either the
Aristoteleans, or the devotees of the Liberalism of Paolo Sarpi, must
therefore presume a principle of universal entropy as being inherent in the
ridiculous presumptions of both the "God is dead" implication of the a-priorist
dogma of Aristotle and Euclid, and the utterly whorish view of the matter
which was proffered by the Liberal Anglo-Dutch school of Paolo Sarpi,
Galileo Galilei, and other modernist followers of the radically reductionist
Ockhamite school.
Therefore, turn to reconsider the thesis bearing upon this as I had
introduced this in that second, immediately preceding report in this present
series.
II. PERSONALITY "B" AGAIN
Dwell, for a bit of time, on the following
recapitulation of that paradoxical notion of the distinction between a
significantly imperfect, but presently typical human personality of type
"A," and a matured personality of type "B," a distinction which I had
introduced in the preceding two components of this compound report. Restate
that case, now, in the setting of the content of the immediately preceding
chapter, here.
In the two preceding components of this compound report, I had identified
two general categories of the relationship between the human mind's
functional relationship to that universe which each among us inhabits. I had
distinguished these two, as of optional personality types "A" and "B,"
respectively.
The essential distinction was, that type "A" was
premised on the view of experience from the standpoint of the person's
presumptive belief in sense-certainty; whereas, the person who has been
matured into the quality of type "B," assumed that the human senses are,
essentially, merely akin to "meter readings," or, "instrument readings,"
shadows cast by developments, rather than being the actuality of the subject
which remains to be treated.
It is the way we must read such "meters," which
determines whether or not our interpretation of sense-experience is
efficiently real (type "B"), or, perhaps, a delusion in one sense or the
other (type "A.").
To discover what does, or does not deserve to be treated as the "Classical,"
"B," case-type of this distinction, take the case from competent modern
science, in which we emphasize the crucial role of physical curves (type
"B"), rather than merely geometric ones (type "A"). In physical science, as
in the cases of the physical curve, the catenary, of Filippo Brunelleschi,
the thesis of Nicholas of Cusa's De Docta Ignorantia, or Leonardo da Vinci's
relationship between the catenary and tractrix, Kepler's uniquely original
discovery of universal gravitation, or, the principle of "least action" of
Pierre de Fermat, and the principle of universal physical least action of
Gottfried Leibniz and Jean Bernouilli: each and all as distinguished from
were, relatively, the failed attempts of not only traditionally Euclidean
geometries, but also the "non-Euclidean" geometries of such as N. I.
Lobatchevsky and Jonas Bolyai (type "A").
In the course of my own development since my
first rejecting belief in Euclidean geometry entirely during my adolescence,
I had come, by early 1953, to the crucial outcome: the notion of adopting a
physical, rather than what I already hated as an a-priori Euclidean or
neo-Euclidean, formal curvature, as the essential distinction is to be
recognized most clearly, beginning the opening paragraphs of Bernhard
Riemann's 1854 habilitation dissertation.19
That much so far, in opening this chapter, I shall now recapitulate, and,
after that, in the following chapter, amplify, what I have written within
the two preceding sections of this triad of pieces with these just-presented
considerations in view:
-
"What is the functional distinction
between what I have identified as a human mind operating as
'species' type which I have identified as Type 'A,' as distinct from
Type 'B'?"
-
"What is the qualitative difference,
both scientifically and morally, between the two ways of thinking?"
-
"What is the difference in the
definition of 'time,' separating the one (B) from the other (A)?"
-
"What is the specific quality of
personal immortality attributable to Type 'B,' but which does not
exist for Type 'A'?"
-
"What is the difference in quality
between an ordinary society, associated with organization cohering
with a Type 'A' sense of personal identity, and one of Type 'B'?
I begin that account, now, with the following
recapitulation of the points on this matter which I had introduced in the
earlier sections.
Perception vs.
Conception
As I have stressed, repeatedly, in the course of writing the three separate
pieces of which this report is composed, the chief root-cause of the moral
and related faults of human cultures of which we have knowledge up to the
present time, is to be recognized as, that in those cases of which we have
competent forms of relevant knowledge of those cultures, the essential fault
lies in that brutish belief in sense-certainty which has dominated all of
the cultures of which we possess the crucially relevant types of knowledge.
That is to emphasize, that to the degree that
the use of language among the generality of the population, implies that
what the individual senses as an object is the reality of his or her
experience, there is a large degree of moral failure in what passes for
knowledge among the generality of the population of that culture.
The moral and practical distinction of the Type "B" personality from the
more commonplace Type "A." lies here. I restate, and, then, enlarge upon
what I stated in The Rule of Natural Law.
As the case of Helen Keller illustrates the point rather nicely, even
without quite proving it scientifically, our sense-perceptions are merely
the shadows cast upon those instruments which are delivered with us as we
are delivered from the womb: what our senses enable us, eventually, to
perceive as presumed objects, are essentially shadows cast upon those
original scientific-experimental instruments known as our given powers of
sense-perception.
Thus, as in all applications of scientific and
related kinds of instruments which have been created, post partumand to
some significance degree, even earlier, for similar purposes, by mankind, it
is only through what is sometimes identified as "crucial-experimental forms
of cognitive methods," that we gain an efficient insight into the
significance of the reality which lies behind the relevant sense-experiences
projected as shadows upon the screens of our imaginations.
In the meantime, we have added scientific instruments, and their
approximation, to the originally given repertoire of our native-born methods
for expanding the variety of instruments which supplement the given human
sense-organs' role, especially in our efforts to explore the universe of the
domains of the extraordinarily small or large, alike.
By the accumulated assortment of combined means
of these types, we are able to construct experiments, or conjure up their
effective likeness, which define the way in which variously estimable, or
even crucial experiments, present the objects of sense-perception to us in a
fresh, appropriately transformed way. Rather than defining relations by
objects, we now, either define the existence of objects by relations, or
have such opportunities placed within our reach.
This latter type of improvement is the basis for
the ability of some persons to think in terms of dynamics, such as those of
Gottfried Leibniz (or the ancient Pythagoreans and Plato before him), as
contrasted with the intrinsic incompetence of the view of the universe
implicitly presented by Rene Descartes and his followers.
Thus we have, on the one hand, a state of the individual mind in which
objects define relationships, as by Descartes, and the contrary outlook,
that of the dynamics of Nicholas of Cusa's De Docta Ignorantia, the work of
his follower Leonardo da Vinci, Johannes Kepler, Pierre de Format, Gottfried
Leibniz, Abraham Kästner and his followers Gotthold Lessing and Moses
Mendelssohn, Friedrich Schiller, Shelley, Carl F. Gauss, the brothers von
Humboldt, Herbart and Bernhard Riemann, Albert Einstein, and Academician V.I.
Vernadsky, all of whom represent the standpoint of dynamics, rather than a
naive interpretation of "sense certainty."
Heretofore, both within this present report, and on other occasions, I have
repeatedly emphasized the distinction between competent scientific practice
and empiricism, as being expressed in the fact, that the empiricist (a.k.a.,
"behaviorist") sees a principle as being "proven" in terms of a mathematical
formulation, whereas the competent scientist regards a competent
mathematical formulation as expressing a "footprint-like" effect of a
proven, or what is suspected to be a provable universal principle.20
As I have emphasized earlier, the correct view
of the work of Johannes Kepler in discovering the universal principle of
gravitation, as this is viewed by Albert Einstein, is that while Kepler
presented the mathematical formation for the effect of gravitation later
copied by the advocates of the disgusting Isaac Newton, Kepler's gravitation
is, as treated by Einstein, a universal principle whose action defines the
universe as finite,21 but whose action is also expressed in
Kepler's uniquely original application of this discovered principle to the
local domain of our Solar System.
The essential feature of Kepler's discoveries is that he is, as a follower
of Brunelleschi and Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, among the founders of the
modern European conception of dynamics. Although the formal introduction of
dynamics to modern science was supplied by Gottfried Leibniz during a series
of works supplied by him during the 1690s, that conception was already
implicit in the greatest achievements modern European science since Cusa,
even prior to Leibniz.
Pierre de Fermat is among the most relevant
examples of this, for his role in prompting Leibniz and Jean Bernouilli's
work in defining a universal physical principle of least action. Equally
significant is the fact that Leibniz's introduction of this conception of
dynamics, explicitly, to modern European science, was, according to Leibniz
himself, a reflection of the dynamis of the ancient Classical Greek science
of the Pythagoreans and Plato, and also such ancient notables as the great
Eratosthenes.
Most notable, is the fact that the principle of creativity, in both physical
science as in Classical artistic composition, is located essentially in
Classical art, rather than mathematical science as such. Thus, the greater
part of the ruin of Twentieth-century European science occurred through the
post-Franklin Roosevelt destruction of the practice and knowledge of
Classical artistic composition in trans-Atlantic civilization launched by
sponsorship of the existenntialists in general and the program of the
European Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF)actually, the congress for
cultural depravity, during the advent of the post-World War II decades.
The creativity element in physical scientific
progress, as in artistic progress, is centered outside all formal
mathematics, in that Classical poetry and music which is the natural habitat
of those expressed creative powers of the individual human mind which set
the human being apart from, and the beasts and existentialists alike.
Thus, what I have often referenced as the point of the concluding paragraph
of Percy Bysshe Shelley's A Defence of Poetry, presents us a crucial insight
into the function of dynamics generally. All great Classical drama,
similarly, is to be experienced not as action among particular characters,
but as the force of a dynamical principle which subsumes the force of a
largely unwitting invisible hand of dynamics, which shapes the destiny among
the foolish characters who see things only in terms of relations among
individuals, as if pair-wise, rather than "the force of destiny" which grips
them as the apparent hand which the foolish characters on stage have refused
to recognize as the agency of a superior will which shapes the outcome of
the drama as a whole.
These dynamics, which do, in fact, generate the relationships among
individuals and groupings society are comparable, in effect, to belief in a
choice of universal principle attributed to physical science. If the choice
is in error, the society of the believers is to be punished, even ruined
entirely, as the beliefs of the 68ers have impelled the present world
society into the present, virtually terminal mode of self-destruction.
So, it is the adoption of the "environmentalism"
of such as Bertrand Russell and his follower, the World Wildlife Fund's
Prince Philip, which has hurtled trans-Atlantic society into the what has
become the almost inevitable plunge of all humanity into the presently
immediate global breakdown-crisis. It is only the exceptional individual,
who not only sees the folly of this control of society by popular beliefs,
but who has the determination to act to bring about the end of that
mass-insanity gripping a nation, or nations, who is an exception to the
"lemming like" grip of a madness such as that which has controlled the
U.S.A. as a social-political-economic system since early 1968.
Only the individual who rejects the grip of
"popular opinion" is capable of leading his or her society out of a
virtually mass-suicidal plunge into a passage through Hell such as that
oncoming at this moment of writing.
As Shelley emphasizes the other side of such social dynamics in his A
Defence of Poetry, he wrote of a time in history when a great revival of
culture was in progress, a time when even people of wicked inclinations were
sometimes swept along by the tide of progress.
This view of Shelley's argument coincides entirely with that of Leibniz, and
that not accidentally. The case of the role of Classical music in the
creativity of Albert Einstein is fully consistent with this principle of
creativity.
It is in the application of the powers of the
Classical imagination to the rigors of experimental tests performed as the
work of physical science, that we have secured all the valid discoveries of
those general physical principles, through aid of which the practical
achievements of physical economy have been generated. It is only when we
study the nature and related characteristics of the human mind, as through
imposed a reciprocal discipline of the Classical scientific method of Plato
and moderns such as the followers of Cusa in physical science with the
signal achievements launched by the fundamental discovery by Johann
Sebastian Bach, that society has become equipped to reverse the terrible and
disgusting degeneration of the culture and economy of the world's
malpractice of what is called economics today.
This general type of distinction between two contrasted world-outlooks,
presents us with the effect of those contrary viewpoints expressed as either
Type A, or the dynamical standpoint of Type B.
This is the same principle of dynamics reflected
in the closing paragraph of Shelley's A Defense of Poetry.
For Example:
Space-Time
The difficulties inhering in the intention to transport people, rather than
mere baggage, across interplanetary intervals within Solar space, poses the
problematic discussion of supplying a state of electromagnetic
"1-G(ravity)," or functionally comparable environment within the system by
which the passengers and crew are being transported.
Once we had achieved and deployed that
capability, we have changed the functional meaning of the term "human race"
in a truly universal way That is to say, we have based the dynamic
characteristic of human relations, those of a Solar domain defined,
dynamically, by a generalized capability for "One-G" acceleration in
movement within even a portion of the Solar System, we have changed the
functional definition of mankind, and of human relations, absolutely. These
relations, to the degree they can be achieved for mankind, are defined by
the existence of relationships defined in terms of generalized "One-G" or
comparable rates of constant acceleration with respect to both gravitation
and magnetic fields. All humanity then becomes "people in space," rather
than merely an Earth-hound species: hence, "Ad Astra!".
We will have transformed that enemy, which is an inability to be a race in
space, into a friend, transforming a prison-like confinement to our planet,
into a font of greater human freedom within astronomical space.
This transformation has other leading dimensionalities.
The ability to meet the challenges of both human interplanetary travel, and
of the development of what were otherwise hostile habits among our
destinations, depends upon a rule-of-thumb principle of competent
present-day physical science known, for convenience, as qualitatively upward
leaps in the energy-flux density of supplies of power employed (and,
available).
On this account, where the mastery of controlled
nuclear fission brings us up to the level of entering the pre-conditions for
human life in nearby Solar space, that as man, rather than mere objects, the
realization of this initial break to freedom requires the mastery of the
qualitatively higher orders of energy-flux density represented by controlled
thermonuclear fusion.
Such are the initial, leading considerations posed by our reflections upon
the matter as we have considered it here, so far, We have emphasized the
positive factors. Consider the alternative: what happens to us if we do not
make this upward leap to freedom from an Earth-bound existence?
So far, in this chapter, I have emphasized the opportunities represented by
changes in these specific directions. We must also consider as, perhaps,
even much more urgent, what happens to mankind if we fail to develop in
these directions.
"The Hounds At Our
Heels!"
For such reasons, not only must we now abandon the vicious delusion known as
"monetary value; we must go over, entirely, to posing the notion of economic
value as being essential physical-economic value, as that notion of value
must be situated in terms of processes defined, essentially, in terms of the
interactive relationships among the Lithosphere, the Biosphere, and the
Noösphere.
We must begin the exploration of the meaning of
a physical economy by subsuming that threefold process, by regard for what
has been society's crucial margin of dependency, in physical-economic terms,
on, first, the effects of relative depletion, not exhaustion, of the
relatively richest concentration of those essential resources, in the normal
course of mankind's combined growth of population and technological
progress.
I explain, that living processes, by absorbing selected isotopes of elements
from the array of the given periodic table into their life-processes, have
provided mankind with deposits in which certain elements-isotopes are
concentrated as residues of the Biosphere's existence. Mankind's
productivity, per capita and per square kilometer, thus far, has depended to
large degree on the richest concentrations of those elements; the relative
physical productivity of cultures, has depended upon access to relatively
richer concentrations of isotopes accessed in this way.
As mankind draws down the more readily available
of the supply of the richest such deposits, the potential relative
population-density of a culture would tend to collapse, unless the effective
productivity of mankind per capita and per square kilometer of relevant
territory, were increased to the effect of causing the potential relative
population-density to increase, and to promote an increase in the rate of
increase.
Thus, the shift of the minimal standard requirement from simple use of
sunlight at its relevant lowest value (at the Earth's surface), to the
advantage over bald sun-light represented by the work of chlorophyll, to
man's burning of trash, to charcoal, to coal, to coke, to petroleum, to
natural gas, and then to the leaps to higher qualities of energy-flux
density of nuclear fission, and the early prospect of thermonuclear fusion,
and the tantalizing subject of matter/anti-matter reactions, are the lawful
requirements of endless scientific progress for any civilization which does
not intend to destroy itself rapidly at this point of world history to date.
By the same inexorable logic, the security of mankind's continued existence
depends upon shifting the hazard of our species' presently Earth-bound
existence, from the confines of the surface regions of our planet, to human
life in interplanetary space, and, thence, beyond, into our galaxy
generally, and, then, beyond that. The achievements of the space-program
since the beginning of its systemic development as a mission-orientation,
during the 1920s, must be acknowledged by a programmatic commitment to this
effect foreseen among relevant scientific thinkers since that time.
This viewpoint challenges the imagination of all truly thoughtful scientists
and theologians respecting the notions of "Creator," "mankind," and human
individual "immortality."
This does not lead us away from the notions of
Genesis 1, for example, but only clarifies the way that chapter of Genesis
is to be read, as mankind rises out of an apparent state of relative
brutishness, to the present outlook with which we are confronted by the
combined notions of the limits of the prospects for human life confined to
Earth, or even our Solar System, into humanity existing as humanity, still,
as an inhabitant of our galaxy, and beyond that.
Man made in the likeness of, and servant of the
living Creator of the universe, acquires a certain far richer meaning, a
nearer and nearer approximation of human existence's true meaning, not only
as a species, but as expressed in that identity of the mind of the human
individual which is the notion of the individual human "soul." The great
mystery of it all changes its appearance, as if in the gradual clearing away
of the mists, as seeing more clearly what had appeared as if "through a
glass darkly.".
What I have just outlined in that description, is no fantasy. From insight
into the greatest works of Classical artistic compositionbut, only
Classical artistic compositionthose among us who have enjoyed a witting,
and experimentally validated experience of true creativity, see matters a
bit differently than those who continue to be blinded by self-inflicted
devotion to living as like blind worms, within the dark sack of grubby faith
in sense-certainty.
That is not a "merely speculative" view of matters. All among us who have
come to recognize what I have termed a "Type B" sense of personal,
functional identity, know this. The others, who do not recognize this,
continue to live as children; the "Type A" personalities, who view reality
with their power of intellectual vision blinded by refusal, as by the
self-blinded men and women worshiping Euclidean geometry, refusing, thus, to
open their eyes to human individual creativity.
It is through true human creativity, as this is only typified by the
progress of society's intentions from the relative bestiality of evil Prince
Philip's self-styled "environmentalists," that a sane mankind moves from
reliance on lower forms of "energy-flux density, " to higher ones, that the
progress, even the continuation of civilized forms of existence, is made
possible for humanity. It is here, that the role of higher energy-flux
densities, such as those of nuclear-fission now, and the looming prospect of
controlled thermonuclear fusion tomorrow, brings the future of man's rise
form that state of risk of being a citizen of our fragile planet to man in
Solar System, and then the stars, that we become the true citizens of the
real universe, out from such filthy hovels as the Anglo-Dutch Liberal
imperialism of today.
In real-life history, the proverbial hounds are at our heels. We must move
upward, along those pathways in nearby space, to desirable destinations
along the relativistic highways which were being paved by the beautiful mind
of that great lover of Classical musical composition, Albert Einstein.
Thus, these points now considered, we have been presented, in the preceding
paragraphs here, with the kernel of the fundamental principle of that
science of physical economy on which all future civilized existence on this
planet now depends absolutely.
That is the objective side of a science of
physical economy; now we must consider the subjective side; here, the
concept of "Type 'B' " becomes crucial.
III. THE SUBJECTIVE SIDE OF SCIENCE
In the course of the second component of this
present trilogy on the subject of a science of economy, I have outlined the
principled features of a physically efficient, subjective aspect of a
practice of the science of physical economy.
I have located the central principle of that
science, in the remedy for the systemic disagreement between two contrasting
states of the human individual mind, the presently familiar "Type 'A'." and
the qualitatively superior, less familiar "Type 'B'."
I now restate, and amplify, the argument already
outlined there.
The known evidence from which competent physical science found its ancient
roots, was in the practice of oceanic navigation according to the changes in
array of those markers known as the planets and stars, a practice which gave
rise to the meaningful use of the term "universe," not as an image, but as a
dynamical form of process, as indicated by the ancient use of the term
dynamis, or, the modern concept of dynamics as that latter term was
introduced by Gottfried Leibniz during the 1690s.
This is the process of development of that concept of dynamics which
underlies the Riemannian concepts of relativity of Albert Einstein and V. I.
Vernadsky, today, concepts which had already been expressed by ancient
maritime cultures during the many hundreds of centuries prior to the roughly
estimated onset of the close of the ice age as about 20,000 years ago.22
True science is was not isolated experiments
which merely appear to be "repeatably" successful. The standard for a proof
of principle is its grounding in what is demonstrably universal from among
the stars, expressed as the power, as from above, which controls the destiny
of mankind. All other proofs depend upon their demonstrable derivation from
actually universal principles so adduced, as the celebrated work of such
followers of Bernhard Riemann as Albert Einstein and Academician V. I.
Vernadsky best illustrate the presently best known extent of that
connection.
Thus, mapping what were, at least, of apparently two fixed points on the
ground-level map of our planet under the condition of changes in the
apparent positions of planets and stars over time, as shown by the work of
the great Eratosthenes, define that irony which gave rise to humanity's
notion of universal during those times. This, of course, leads to the
apposite approach, locating the changes in the map of the planet's surface
according to changes observed to occur within an astronomical universe, and,
then, in turn, to the study of detected, long-ranging changes in what might
have been thought a simple regularity of movements in the heavens. It is
important to acquire the habit of thinking about related matters in such a
fashion, even if only for the purpose of training the human mind to deal
competently with the idea of that universe which we inhabit.
This practice fosters that quality of freedom in
thinking which is indispensable for promoting the creative powers of the
human mind. It is of the highest importance to examine your own mind's
process of thinking, thus using the playing of such imagined tricks upon
oneself, as a way of promoting true self-consciousnessa truly ironical
self-consciousness: to make one's own processes of thinking, when caught in
the moments of their relatively greatest moment of deceptively apparent
finality, one recognized as a mere object of one's own continuing to think
in new, higher-order terms of reference, while our mind's attention has
leaped, meanwhile, to the challenge posed by a qualitatively higher set of
relative terms of reference.
As the ancient practice of Sphaerics illustrates the point, what should
actually be regarded as science, is limited to evidence of principles which
are truly of the universe, principles whose proof is of a type rooted
historically in the use of astronomy for celestial navigation in,
especially, the oceans and seas of the world, as this was done by Johannes
Kepler, and by such of his followers in scientific method as the great
physicist Carl F. Gauss.
This self-critical view is rooted in what is implicitly astrophysics, in
observing one's own creative processes in action, reflectively, so, as I
shall emphasize here, it is also the key to the true meaning of the artistic
imagination, as artistic imagination is the typical characteristic of
scientific outlooks coherent with a sense of personal identity rooted in the
concept of a "Type 'B' " method.
This is of critical importance for
understanding the foundations of competent approaches to understanding the
roots of any competent attention to the subject of the principles underlying
a science of physical economy.
It is the discovery of the existence of universal physical principles, in
that way, which has been required to develop the concept underlying all
competent physical science. This is accomplished by forcing societies to
cease depending on a depraved form of naive faith in the bare human senses
as such, as the modern "behaviorists," such as the evil Adam Smith, have
done.23
This distinction is the topical area of my
immediate subject here.
Smith is a crucial target for criticism on this account, not because he was
unique in his evil, he was not; but, because of his systemic role as being
evil in respect to one of the two specific roles to which he was assigned
by, and which he performed in the service of frankly Satanic Lord
Shelburne's assignment of Smith: to wit, to seek the destruction of the
freedoms of the English colonies in North America.
This was a plot for which Smith was assigned,
beginning 1763, on behalf of Shelburne's British East India Company, an
initiative on which all truly effective forms of global evil has been
spread, at least principally so, throughout the world since that time, up to
the present instant these lines of mine are written here.24 It is
not what an individual does, as an individual, which is the root of the
historical importance, for good or evil, to be attributed to him, or her, in
science, or otherwise. Rather, this subject must be assessed from the
vantage-point of social dynamics, as the crucially important closing
paragraphs of Shelley's
A Defence of Poetry
identify this topic.
It is the discovery of a true scientific principle, or any other principle
which affects the direction of the condition of society to kindred effect,
and, which, therefore, distinguishes the individual who actually shapes
history, from the virtual puppets who dangle and dance as directed so by the
pulling of those strings of a common and prevalent ideology which holds
their very souls in the captivity of their naive beliefs.
Those exceptional individuals who have served as
great discoverers of principle, are of relatively unique importance for
understanding any part of real history, because all social processes, and,
indeed, all kinds of processes in the universe, are essentially dynamic
(e.g. Platonic), rather than reductionist (e.g., Cartesian, behaviorist), in
character. It is only by knowing now to overturn those false principles
which fools, such as Euclid, have been imagined to have been either
"self-evident," or merely simple, that we are enabled to bring true human
knowledge into play.
Whether the exceptional such individual who does
this, is an object suited better for either infamy or adoration, the
principle of this subject-matter remains the same. It were more important to
become such an exceptional individual of the "Type 'B' " category, than an
emperor of a galaxy: one would hope, for the good of mankind. It were only
required that one have the courage, even the sometimes astonishing boldness,
to be just that, whatever the beckoning or menacing circumstances of the
moment.
To that point, it is the introduction of the knowledge and use of a true
universal principle, whether for good, or evil, which defines the dynamical
character of all history, of man, as of the universe as a whole. It is
action which shapes, or changes such dynamics, which is the actually shaping
of the history of any particular phase of both a culture of mankind, and of
the universe in its entirety.
To come to the kernel of the business assigned to this chapter of the
report, the possibility of knowing the state of sense of personal identity
which corresponds to a personality of "Type 'B'," as distinct from "Type
'A'," is a benefit of the historical process of successive discoveries,
assessed by reference to a process by which at least some part of the human
population has come to a knowledgeable command of his, or her own sense of
an outlook on an imagined universe of the type which corresponds to the
characteristic form of belief held by a "Type 'B' " personality.
In other words, animals are born and die as individual mortal members of the
same assembly of living creatures. Human beings, when they are fully human
in the intellectual sense, locate their identity in history, rather than as
some creature whose efficient existence is limited to the span of its mortal
existence in the flesh.
Human individuals rightly locate their identity
in such a fashion, that, what people become when born, already begins to
embody the net accumulation of changes in culture which have endured, in one
fashion or another, over many preceding generations, especially of that
language-culture. True ideas of principle do not appear as discrete events,
but as the expressed process of outgrowth of a long sequence, of many
generations, encompassing the preceding developments in which the
development and birth of that idea is situated dynamically. This is the
principle of dynamics as revived, explicitly, during the decade of the 1690s
by Gottfried Leibniz.
True ideas of principle fix the point of reality of our present, mortal
existence, at some future destination, a destination chosen as a
professional mountain-climber selects the peak which he has yet to climb up
to the present time, perhaps which no one had reached earlier, perhaps a
time, perhaps a destination lying beyond the span of the merely mortal form
of his, or her existence. We must think in the future, to locate the true
future meaning of present choice of a way living, of working day by day.
So did Nicholas of Cusa; so did the
Christopher Columbus inspired by the proposal given by Cusa.25
Thus, we have:
Cusa, Columbus & "The
Mayflower"
This distinction, of dynamics, as it also applies to social processes as
such, as to physical science, can be made most clearly for one of those
among us who dwells in the tradition of the process leading into the
American Revolution, when, and if, he or she has gained the knowledge and
relevant experience to recognize the systemic points of difference of the
patriotic (anti-British empire) American citizen, from the somewhat contrary
cultural outlook of the more typical case of even the present-day European.
So, the meaning of the our lives as citizens of our republic which dwells
within the world at large, lies in our ability, whether American or
European, to grasp the future meaning of the distant destination, in space,
time, or both, on which we have chosen to be embarked.
It should be clear enough, that all good works by persons in current time,
are not defined by what we happen to use up during our own lifetimes, but,
rather, good results usually rely on anticipation of the future outcome of
those discoveries, that for the benefit of future generations of mankind;
such is the option we should seek in the normal choice, a choice of that
which we have chosen to become currently engaged in building, in our
devotion to the future defined in this way.
"What, child, do you intend to become when
you are grown up?"
The trouble was, that most baby-boomers
preferred not to think very much about the existential experience of either
others, or even themselves, beyond a very, very short distance into their
present future.
So, as I have indicated above, the most remarkable such distinction is that
the development which became the United States, was a reflection of the
influence of Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa's design for crossing oceans to find
the opportunity to develop the cultural heritage of European civilization in
a place at some relatively great distance from that plague-like,
imperialistic, oligarchical form of maritime tradition, a search which has
prevailed in European cultures since the infamous Peloponnesian War.
Christopher Columbus' voyage, which was inspired
by his knowledge of Cusa's trans-oceanic perspective, pin-points the true
origin, and deep-rooted historical character of what became our United
States of America and its unique, constitutional system of political
economy.
Unfortunately, the broader development of this project within the Americas
as a whole, has been crippled, although more emphatically in other parts of
the Americas, than in our U.S.A., until the U.S.A. itself had been plunged
into decadence by approximately late Spring 1968. The similar expression of
such a defect within the other modern national American cultures to our
south, is to be blamed chiefly on the long, polluting reach into the other
parts of the Americas by the combined actions of the Habsburgs, and their
successors and masters, the British empire as Simon Bolivar, at the end of
his life, in Colombia, described this British role in South America.
The increase of the British brand of Venetian
monetarist control over South America today, for example, is expressed by
the ruinous interval of the British orchestration of that successor to the
pre-1763 "Seven Years War" which became known as the Napoleonic Wars. Such
were the wars which a foolish, narcissistically self-deluded Napoleon fought
for, in fact, embedding a British imperial reign over all Europe, through
creating a more successful version of a "Seven Years War," under a foolish
Napoleon Bonaparte's new "Seven Years War," the so-called "Napoleonic wars."
The result was a grip of the British Empire on
continental Europe which was never successfully challenged in any part of
Europe until President Abraham Lincoln had led the United States to victory
over the British Empire and its London-controlled Confederacy puppets.
Every major war on this planet since 1865 has been an offshoot of the
principal goal of the British Empire, that empire's desperate commitment to
bringing about the ultimate destruction of our United States. Every war by
the British empire, everywhere, since that time has been subsumed by the
British obsession with bringing about the ultimate destruction of our United
States, as is the British intent in deploying its puppet Barack Obama now.
Similarly, there is no treasonous enterprise, such as the Wall Street rape
of our national economic system, or the continued existence of Goldman Sachs
itself today, which is not an exertion of that British intention now.
The actual British war-guilt for every aspect of
World Wars I and II, and the role, in seeking to nullify the 1648 Peace of
Westphalia, by such unspeakable moral degenerates as former British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, typifies the same issues posed by so-called
"British Imperialism" today.
-
For Example: The fact to be
emphasized in seeking to understand the present, global world economic
breakdown-crisis in progress today, is that, as I have just indicated,
above, the Napoleonic wars served, still later, as the true predecessor
of a new "Seven Years War" launched from London, so-called "World War I"
and London's resumption of that as "World War II," all combined
occurring as a set of outcomes made possible by the combination of the
1890 ouster of Chancellor Bismarck and the 1901 assassination of U.S.
President William McKinley.26
-
For example: McKinley had been killed
by an assassin brought, from Europe, into a New York City safe-house
controlled by British interests.27 That imported assassin had
been harbored for the purpose of this mission, by the greater New York
City Anglophile oligarchy, thus bringing into the Presidency the
actually treasonous Theodore Roosevelt (the nephew of a British agent in
the Confederacy operations) and, also, the Woodrow Wilson of the Ku Klux
Klan family tradition, who actually relaunched the Ku Klux Klan from
what Teddy Roosevelt had renamed "The White House" during that
Roosevelt's own term as President.
Meanwhile, back in Europe, the persistent
recurrence of parliamentary systems in Europe, and otherwise systems of law
and traditions of social practice which systemic flaws in specifically
European cultures still today, is key for understanding the organic quality
of difference in cultural world-outlook distinguishing U.S. republicanism
from the pro-oligarchical relics of a European Liberal democracy still
deeply corrupted by the legacy of Paolo Sarpi and of such among his notable
followers as Abbe Antonio S. Conti and Voltaire, still today.
For related reasons which are illustrated with a certain excellence by what
I have just identified as "the Columbus Principle" on which the existence of
the United States has depended, it would be absurd to define the culture of
the U.S.A. as peculiar in origin to itself. The culture of the patriots of
our United States has been a branch of the European culture which has
persisted since no later than Solon of Athens and such among Solon's
political heirs as Plato.
The foundation of the cultures of the Americas
is, virtually in entirety, the effect of transplanting the seed of an
already existing species of European culture to a habitat, across the
Atlantic, which was a healthier place for its realization than in the
relatively decadent, more emphatically pro-oligarchical habitats of Europe.
However, it is also the case, that the afflictions of the worst "diseases"
which the American cultural species has suffered, are the result of cultural
"spores," chiefly modern British imperialism, which have invaded the
cultures of the Americans, bringing the moral diseases associated with the
still persisting, pro-oligarchical cultural habits of "Old Europe," such as
parliamentary systems.
However, there is a more fundamental issue underlying the aforesaid
considerations:
The Fundamental
Principle
The underlying principle in all of this and related matters, is that the
systemic uniqueness of the human personality, relative to all other types of
known living creatures, is that mankind is able to shape the direction of
the development of the region he inhabits within the universe, as in the
discovery and application of universal physical principles, as Kepler, for
example, discovered a universal principle of gravitation, through his use of
the creative powers unique to the human individual.
In this respect, man not only acts to alter the
course of the universe in that degree, but, it is an essential principle of
the science of physical economy, that man is acted upon, for better or for
worse, by the universe's own reaction to mankind's willful changes in both
the parts of the universe which we inhabit, and even beyond.
This is a fact which is only illustrated by the way a trained jet aircraft
pilot might think about a space-pilot's controlling role within the
relativistic effects of a continuously accelerated/decelerated travel to
Mars-orbit, a journey expressed as the experience of that space-pilot's
functioning in flight.
Thinking of a human species living within the
biosphere, and thinking of mankind as controlling the development of the
biosphere, like thinking of man as an Earth-dweller as compared to man
inhabiting the domain of the relativistic modalities of accelerated
space-travel, correspond, in both comparisons, to two qualitatively
different definitions of what are but relativistic phases of the same
principle of mankind. Accelerated trajectories in space-travel is a nearer
experience of true human nature, than growing paunchy as a contented (or,
discontented) Earth-grubber.
This is not merely an illustration of my crucial point; it is my use of a
relatively extreme case to convey a sense of those boundary conditions
through which we are enabled to convey the characteristics of human
existence, even as the embedded potential contained within a man whose
experience is limited to walking from one place to another.
To come to live in space, as travel between
Earth and Mars, and dwelling there betwixt and between, requires that man
change his environment to bring the condition of travel and Mars-habitation
into conformity with normal human requirements. We must create "artificial
environments" as the buffer between normal human requirements, as if on the
surface of Earth, and an equivalent effect of human life for man under the
conditions of travel and habitation in tolerable, and reachable parts of the
Solar System with characteristics outside the standards of Earth's surface.
We already do that in development of the Noösphere from primitive to modern
physical-economics standards of human practice. Comparing that role of
scientific-technological progress of cultures on Earth in recent centuries,
to the new qualities of progress required for exploration of nearby Solar
space, should be employed as a way of generalizing the concept of typical
human progress in such a way that both of the compared states are conceived
as it they expressed a single principle of human development.
The means we must discover how to employ the effect of a successful
extension of the idea of scientific-technological progress in those broader
terms will require the approach to virtually every-day mastery of discovered
physical principles which are beyond usual classroom visions presently. So,
what!
Discovery is the fun of the game! It is the kind
of game which really progressive human persons love to play, often even at
the price of the explorer's great daring to risk his life. After all, what
any of us really "gets out of life," is, in the long run, what we give to
it.
Looking at the contrast of "Type 'B' " to "Type 'A' " will also help to make
clear the implications of this point:
Principle & Phenomenon
There are four crucial principles which must be considered as primary
matters of reference in treating the subject of the human mind within the
setting of the subject of physical space-time within our Solar system.
-
First, is the principled distinction of
subject-matters which are not considered as, apparently, the
distinction of, or products of living processes (the Lithosphere).
-
Second, is the principled distinction of
subject-matters which exist for us only as either living processes,
or as products of what had been living processes (the Biosphere).
-
Third, is the principled distinction of
the sensory functions of the mind of the living human individual,
that as a biological phenomenon.
-
Fourth, is the creative powersthe
powers of creative imaginationof the individual human mind, as
distinct from the animal-like capabilities of the living human body
(the subject of the Noösphere): the phenomena of what is identified
meaningfully as the human soul.
It is only when the distinctions and
interrelationships among all four of these categories are taken under
consideration, that the notion of the individual human "soul" finds its real
place in study of the efficient principles and effects to be considered in
the context of physical science.
This matter comes fully into play once the field
of inquiry is shifted to the matter of efficiently extra-terrestial roles of
human life under conditions of relativistic interplanetary travel and social
relations defined within the bounds of such terms of reference.
Keep the fact of my statement of these as facts to be considered, here and
now. I shall return, to qualify these distinctions, at the appropriate
points of the development of the following argument.
The first lesson which any person who would be a competent economist must
now master, is the importance of rejecting the popular delusion that
mankind's inhabiting the planet Earth, or any particular territory within
Earth, the delusion that man is merely living within the bounds of nature.
Man, if he is productive, is changing his habitation, as by a higher
authority than "nature" otherwise defined, that as if from above.
If his practiced culture is truly productive, man is depleting the richest
of those practically accessible resources he employs as "natural resources,"
but, nonetheless, man must be constantly increasing the productive powers of
labor, per capita, and per square kilometer of relevant territory, such that
the typical individual is more productive, and richer, with the new,
relatively poorer resources, than with the relatively richer, earlier
resources.
In the known history of cultures, this increasing of net productivity per
capita and per square kilometer, is associated with a long-wave trend toward
increase of the relative energy-flux density of the modes of heat-work
employed, moving upward from the poorest quality of general resource, such
as sunlight impinging on what is conventionally classified as our planet's
surface, to the improvement of the net energy-flux density accomplished as
the work of chlorophyll and the related role of increased use of that carbon
atom which plays such a crucial role in the possibility of life, especially
human life.
We progress from burning of trash, to charcoal,
to coal, to coke, to petroleum and natural gas, and then the leap into the
much more powerful energy-flux densities of nuclear and thermonuclear power.
It is the increase of the application of a certain energy-flux density, per
capita, as distributed, in one or several particular portions, per square
kilometer of territory, which is not only the only principled course for the
improvement of the condition of human life, but without such increases in
energy-flux density, human life on this planet must necessarily deteriorate,
ultimately to the point a large degree of genocide against the planet's
population as a whole.
A contrary policy, such as those of today's neo-malthusian
fanatics, such as the World Wildlife Fund's
Prince Philip, et al., would be
clearly, and criminally, insane in its effects.
In fact, we have already entered such a phase of degradation.
Take the case of potable water as illustration. We are presently drawing
down previously existing stocks of current sources of potable water at such
rates that we are already moving toward a global ecological catastrophe for
mankind, unless we change current trends by a very large-scale rate of
increase of the use of nuclear-fission and thermonuclear-fusion sources of
the power needed to ensure a suitable fresh water supply for even the
existing level of population.
The notion that present ground-level sources of
solar and wind "power," or sources of potable water, could meet human needs,
is sheer lunacy. In any case, the world is currently in a global-cooling
phase, headed toward, and already within the beginning of a cooling period
such as those experienced during the late Eighteenth and early Nineteenth
centuries, all contrary to the widespread lies currently spread among the
credulous by the incredible.
Every change in patterns of land-use since the middle of the 1960s, has been
fairly described as worse than merely insane in its effects on present
society, with even much worse effects if this nonsense is permitted to be
continued during the decades immediately ahead. We must increase the
physical productive powers of labor, per capita, and per square kilometer of
territory at a fairly high rate, even for the purpose of providing
socio-economic stability of the existing trends in population globally.
The general formulation to be brought into play here, is that the
development the preconditions of human life, depends upon the action of the
Biosphere upon the Lithosphere, to the effect of generating the
preconditions required for progress in the condition of human life. Mankind
must manage this relationship, both to reap the harvest of the Biosphere,
but, also, to increase man's power of action, per capita and per square
kilometer, such that we shift the emphasis away from relying upon the
relatively depleted formerly richer fossil remains of the product of the
Biosphere, by increasing the physical productivity of mankind, per capita
and per square kilometer, that at such rates that the net result is
increased productivity per capita and per square kilometer, despite the
obligation for using increasingly poor qualities of natural resources to the
effect of increasing the net physical output of product per capita and per
square kilometer.
This also requires that we increase the power of productivity of mankind,
per capita and per square kilometer. This can be accomplished only through,
chiefly, emphasis in increasing the level of expressed human creative
intelligence of the population, in physical terms, and the creating of
superior products by that means.
The included general implication of this, is that the net capital physical
intensity of the economy, per capita and per square kilometer, will increase
more rapidly than the increase of direct productivity. This also means that
the "life-span" of the relevant capital improvements will be increased, at
the same time that the capital-intensity of what is consumed per capita and
per square kilometer is also increased. In that sense, man's
societymankind's economymust become increasingly synthetic, relative to
the rate of current consumption of what is being currently produced as
useful product otherwise.
This process, which must be fostered, if mankind is to survive even within
the bounds of this planet, when that process is described as I have just
indicated, signifies that humanity is approaching a required point of
combined increase of productivity and capital-intensity, on Earth itself,
such that this trend toward such compounded rates of physical-capital
intensity and related productivity, is moving us toward the practical
urgency of launching a society within the immediately more convenient
regions of the Solar system, in which space travel will become increasing
economical. We are moving, in the longer term, toward man in our galaxy.28
The question to be asked is: how is this possible? What is the assured
source of increase of human physical productivity, such that mankind is
capable of generating physical-scientific progress at the rates which my
descriptive set of ratios, just given here, implies?
This brings us now, again, to the crucial matter of the "Type 'B' "
personality.
Type B, Restated
When the newborn person is released from the womb, with the consequent
effect of something resembling the unpacking the contents of a crate which
contains the latest new creation delivered from the factory, the bawling,
naked individual thus unleashed upon society, is delivered and presented,
more or less complete, with certain accompanying, essential attachments
commonly identified as "the senses."
The ignorant person would tend to believe, that
what these instruments, the senses, transmit, as a kind of image, to the
human mind, is the image of reality.
Not so: the great principled discoveries of science show us that these
so-called senses do not present us with a direct image of either the
principles, or objects which control the real universe of our experience,
but, are, rather, merely the essential items of instrumentation delivered,
as accessories, more or less intact, with the arrival of the infant.
This becomes clearer and clearer to the
scientist as mankind develops new, artificial senses, like added
attachments, to present the human mind with subsidiary senses intended to
reflect changes around us which are either too large, or too small in scale,
for the human individual to observe directly, or have been crafted to
present us with shadows of reality which do not fit specific categories for
which the original package of human sense-perceptual equipment was intended
to measure the relevant intended effect to be observed.
So, as I have emphasized at earlier points in this present report, our
senses do not show us the reality outside our skins; they show us a shadow
cast by the reality. Weour mindcan not "see" directly what has cast that
shadow; we must craft an image in the human mind which experimental methods
can prove to be the shadowy "other" image presented to natural or synthetic,
sense-perceptual instruments.
The most essential work of the individual human mind, on this account, is
that of adducing what science identifies as universal physical principles,
such as Kepler's uniquely original discovery of universal gravitation, or
the principle of dynamics as brought onto the modern stage by Leibniz, and
developed more richly by such followers of Bernhard Riemann as Albert
Einstein and V.I. Vernadsky.
By aid of the application of these discovered
principles, we are enabled to explore the panoply of shadows known as normal
and artificial sense-perceptions in, for example, a competent form of
progressive development of modern physical science.
Thus, we have the two types of mentality to which I have referred,
repeatedly, in this report: Type "A" and Type "B." The first, "A," is
presented by the case of the naive believer in sense-certainty, who blunders
repeatedly, by clutching at those gritty shadows which the more
simple-minded citizen has mistaken for the objects which have cast the
shadows.
The credulous dupes of Paolo Sarpi, such as
Locke, Adam Smith, and Jeremy Bentham, are nasty versions of the expression
of this fault, victims victimized by beliefs resembling Type "A" case
generally. As Adam Smith emphasized his own streak of evil, as in the
passage which I excerpted, above, from his The Theory of the Moral
Sentiments, he is typical of the vicious incompetence of the behaviorists
and kindred empiricists of the Type "A" variety generally.
We, on the other hand, must learn to act effectively on the objects which we
can not sense directly, by striking toward those unseen objects whose
presence the shadows have betrayed. We must act as if we could actually see
the force of the dynamics which controls the apparent objects in motion:
dynamics as Percy Shelley sums up the matter in the closing paragraphs of
his A Defence of Poetry.
We must strike at the unseen object, which we
can not sense directly, but which we can adduce, efficiently, as the
efficient presence lurking to attack us from his place under cover of
sensory darkness. Our power to do exactly that, hit the unseen enemy on his
flank, is always the task immediately before us, whether the enemy is
hunger, disease, popular misery generally, or a vicious mortal foe of the
welfare of mankind.
"What flank!?" we hear some silly fellow calling in from the back of that
room wherein we are speaking.
"What is this? Voodoo? I believe what I can
touch!"
The power to act efficiently against the
ostensibly unseen, is the specific genius which most clearly distinguishes
thinking adult men and women from the monkeys caught in a Malaysian farmer's
monkey-trap. The agency by which this wondrous and absolutely indispensable
capacity depends, is what is called "the imagination." The principal
expression of this faculty of the human mind is Classical poetry and its
integral feature, vocal well-tempered counterpoint. The essential function
performed by this faculty is Classical poetic-musical irony.
The highest degree of refinement of this faculty
of the actually creative mind, has been developed on the basis of the system
of well-tempered counterpoint launched by the Johann Sebastian Bach whose
influence produced all truly great musical compositions and their
performance from J. S. Bach himself through the last principal works of
Johannes Brahms, such as his great Vier Ernste Gesänge and his Opus 120 pair
of clarinet sonatas.
The unique quality of the achievements of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,
especially from the time of his deep steeping in the work of, especially,
Johann Sebastian Bach, as in Mozart's association with the Sunday events at
the Vienna salon of former diplomat at the court of Friedrich der Grosse,
Gottfried van Swieten,29 and of the greatest giant since Bach
himself, Ludwig van Beethoven, or the related, massive output of Franz
Schubert, or the related genius of Giuseppe Verdi, even taking notice of the
otherwise ungodly hater of Johannes Brahms, the wildly Romantic admirer of
the fervently Satanic Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt, the Hugo Wolf of his
Mörike and Goethe Lieder.
Modern European
History
To understand the modern European Classical Renaissance, we must steep
ourselves in the echoes of Dante Alighieri, and the consequences of that
rise of modern European civilization which was centered around the process
leading, explicitly, through the martyrdom of Jeanne d'Arc at the hands of
the heathen Normans' inquisition, into the great ecumenical Council of
Florence and the contribution to the founding of the modern sovereign
nation-state by both Nicholas of Cusa's Concordanica Catholica and the birth
of modern science by Cusa's De Docta Ignorantia.
Despite the pro-satanic religious warfare
launched under the leading role and associated provocations by the Habsburgs
from 1492 through 1648, the launching of the modern nation-state premised on
the central influence of Nicholas of Cusa, and the 1648 resuscitation of
European civilization through the intervention of such as Cardinal Mazarin
and his associate Jean-Baptiste Colbert, has defined the platform on which
all of the great accomplishments of modern European civilization have
depended, essentially.
During those historical intervals of modern European history, from the birth
of the Fifteenth-century Renaissance at the great ecumenical Council of
Florence, through the high points of the history of our U.S. constitutional
republic, the driving force for the progress of civilization has centered,
since February 1763, on the initiative which produced the unique form of
constitutional, republican self-government of our own United States.
However, from the death of President Franklin
Roosevelt, and the accession of his accursed successor, Harry S Truman, the
world has been, in net effect, on a generally, net downward course, both
culturally and in terms of physical economy. The root-cause of this
post-April 12, 1945 moral and related decline of the U.S. republic, from the
relatively high point which had been represented by the Presidency of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was essentially the destruction of Classical
artistic culture by the modalities of the Frankfurt existentialists and the
pro-satanic Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF).
The root of this decadence was fostered, in a
large degree, by the attack on competent methods of physical science led by
the logical-positivist current associated with the mechanics of Ernst Mach
and the more wildly fanatical, ivory-tower positivism of Bertrand Russell's
Russell-Whitehead Principia Mathematica30 and of the school of
such as those, Norbert Weiner and John von Neumann, justly expelled, by
David Hilbert, from Göttingen, on well-founded charges of systemic
incompetence.
While the obvious target of the irrationalists of the positivist schools was
the uprooting of competent methods of physical science, it was the
concurrent launching of the attempted extermination of the
Bach-Haydn-Mozart-Beethoven-Schubert-Brahms legacy of competence, especially
since the rise of the popularity of the cult of Liszt-Wagner, but,
emphatically, the modernist attack on Classical artistic composition, which
has been the principal influence responsible for the ruin of earlier
competence in physical science.
This new attack had been launched largely with the publications of the
Critiques of Immanuel Kant, who had not dared to publish his frauds until
both of the great pair of Abraham Kästner and Moses Mendelssohn were
deceased, and, as the degeneration of culture was continued beyond Kant, by
the founder of the modern conception of the fascist state, Prince's
Metternich's correspondent (and agent) G.W.F. Hegel.
For our immediate purposes here, the crucial
issue is the efforts to uproot the legacy of J. S. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven,
Lessing, Mendelssohn, Schiller, Shelley, and the brothers von Humboldt,
under the circumstances of created by the stunt of the fall of the Bastille,
the Jacobin Terror, and the rise and reign of Napoleon Bonaparte on the
continent of Europe. The crucial aspect of this culture warfare, was the
rise of what is known as Nineteenth-century Romanticism of such as the
founders of that 19th-Century Romantic school of law, G.W.F. Hegel, and Karl
Savigny, that out of which modern European fascism was to emerge, especially
with the added introduction of synarchism in circumstances defined by the
British agent better known as Napoleon III.31
The core of all this destruction of the role of reason in modern European
culture, was the attack on the principles of Classical composition in
poetry, and the relationship of such poetry to Classical musical composition
and Classical drama. What happened at the close of World War II, on both
sides of the Atlantic, was the destruction of Classical poetry and its
expression as Classical musical composition.
The crucial point to be considered here and now, is that the influence of
that power of creativity whose products we encounter in the most notable
achievements of physical science, is that domain of the creative
imagination, through whose "chemistry" the power of creative insight is
supplied to what were otherwise morally dead mathematics. The power of
musicality expressed as Classical poetry, is the faculty of the creative
imagination which produced the great, original scientific insights of
impassioned amateur Albert Einstein's wonderful assaults on the domain of
the unknown in the practice of physical scientific investigations.
There is an aspect of Classical musical performance, which is stunningly
prominent in the conducting of that friend, and sometime member of the
Berlin Jewish musical community, Wilhelm Furtwängler, and in the exemplary
work of my late dear friend of the Amadeus Quartet, Norbert Brainin, which,
as it is sometimes said, gets "between the notes" in a way corresponding to
the Classical principle of the "comma," which no mere music school could
achieve. It comes from the soul, rather than the literal score of, or the
mere vocal mechanics of the singing voice of the man-made Classical
instrument, such as the greatest still-surviving violins.
We may come to recognize this in the performances of the greatest performing
artists which have been delivered "on a good day."
There is nothing pertinent to either attempts at
simple imitation or to that shameful lewdness called "Romanticism" in such
performances. It comes, as it might be said, not from the reading of the
score, nor the pretentious appetites of the ego of the performer, but the
soul.32
The sound is not irrelevant, it is relevant only
as it serves the purpose of the inherent creativity expressed as an idea
which transcends all sound as such. This feature common to Classical poetry
and performance of Classical musical composition, is termed, as by such as
William Empson,33 the domain of Classical irony. a notion of
irony identical in principle with the definition of the role of the physical
principle of "infinitesimal" in Leibniz's discovery of a higher expression
of the calculus during the span of the 1690s.
The Root of The
Leibniz Infinitesimal
What I have now presented, thus far, repeatedly, at several points in the
course of this trilogy on physical economy, is not uniquely original to me
in terms of any among the more broadly defined essentials of that matter.
What I have done which is actually original to
me in that toward which I have pointed here thus far, is a fruit of my
critical insight into the deeper practical, subjective implications of this
knowledge for the practice of a science of physical economy. This is the
aspect of the matter of economics on which all varieties of the heretofore
generally adopted schemes for representing economic processes have failed,
that systemically.
The essential distinction between animal ecology and human physical economy,
on the other, is those creative powers which do not exist among any lower
form of life than mankind, but are found only in the accumulated, vast,
willful increases in the potential relative population-density of the human
species, as the best periods of the development of what became our U.S.
republic illustrate the case..
This subjective power of the human mind is the
one and only cause for the increase of that potential relative
population-density which is unique to the human species among all other
forms of living creatures. This specific creative power, unique to members
of the human species, is the one and only principle underlying the increase
of the potential relative population-density of any successful social
organization among members of the human species.
Money as such, has nothing to do, instrinsically, with such potential for
increase of sustained potential relative population-density in any society.
Therefore, the only competent object of policy-shaping by the U.S.A. or any
other nation, or group of nations, under the present conditions of an
onrushing, planet-wide, general physical-economic breakdown-crisis, is to
subordinate the creation and use of money as being merely a useful form of
credit, a form of credit which is absolutely subordinated to
physical-science-driven increases in the potential relative
population-density and physical standard of living of society.
This is a form of physical margin of gain which
can be effected solely through increases, typified by the general reliance
on increase of the use of nuclear-fission power in the applied energy-flux
density of the economy, per capita and per square kilometer. Any policy
contrary to that, presently, would be implicitly criminal mass-insanity in
its effect.
Otherwise, the relevant principles of science themselves were, otherwise,
already known in bare essentials of method of work in the domain of a
science of physical economy, to many of the greatest scientists since the
relevant ancient Egyptians and Hellenes, such as the ancients Archytas,
Plato, and, later, Eratosthenes. It is the subjective view of these matters
which is, so far, essentially unique to me here, and which is crucial for
society now.
The first topic to be considered here, as to matters of a science of
physical economy which are to be discussed among us here and now, are best
approached from the starting-point of Gottfried Leibniz's uniquely original
discovery of the calculus.34 Let me begin that discussion of the
principles underlying any competent science of physical economy with my own
earlier reaction to Leibniz, as I have referred to that on numerous public
occasions. I rephrase that discussion here from the vantage-point of this
special kind of discussion of "Type B" versus "Type A."
From the start, as I have said in about everything I have published about my
own classroom and related experience, has been premised on the following
included considerations:
I had never accepted the Euclid I
encountered in a secondary school classroom scheduled under the title of
"Plane Geometry I," then, or later As I have reported on numerous
earlier occasions, I had developed my own ideas about geometry before my
first encounter with geometry as a classroom topic, ideas I developed
during a few family visits to the Charles Town navy yard in Boston,
Massachusetts during the early, through middle 1930s.
My most relevant experience there, was my
interest in witnessing certain constructions in progress at that place,
constructions which convinced me that the ability of a structure to
carry its weight required striking an optimal balance between the
respectively distinct dimensional qualities of the mass and the shape of
the supporting parts of the structure.
That was the birth of my concept which I came to
recognize, later, and to the present day, as an anti-Euclidean physical
geometry.
The most crucial subsequent development in my outlook, was that
prompted by Riemann's 1864 habilitation, in my jubilation at encountering
the opening pair of paragraphs presented there, and, more significantly, for
reasons which should be obvious to those who know me, the concluding
sentence.
In other words, when I had entered the classroom on my first day in a
Geometry I classroom, I was already convinced that the function of geometry
was to discover how to optimize the relationship of the respective shape and
mass of the supporting structure. When it came time for me to speak there on
that day, I said so. Many among my silly classmates giggled. Of course, I
was nonetheless, absolutely correct from a standpoint of real physics, but
not according to the standard of the notions of formal-mathematical
completeness attributed to Euclid. I shall return attention to the most
crucial implications of that a bit later here.
That confrontation with a silly, but still popular sort of prevalent
classroom convention, turned out to be one of the greatest advantages of my
life in my becoming a physical economist: my ability to think scientifically
was, thereafter, never crippled, as most of my fellow-students then, or
later suffered, by the commonplace, particular, pandemic-like effect of
actually believing in Euclidean geometry.
That was what attracted me to Gottfried Leibniz
during my teens, and ever since, as to Bernhard Riemann's famous 1864
habilitation dissertation, later, and to my contentious relations with some
leading scientists, over the matter of Johannes Kepler's astronomy, later
on. That is the point of reference for what I say here and now. That is how
I came to be, subsequently, as today, a leading physical economist of the
world, in fact, today: probably, the world's leading economist now.
That advantage, largely gained by my being less
misguided in such matters than nearly all my relevant contemporaries, is
what had brought me to an impassioned preoccupation with Leibniz beginning
the concluding two years of my secondary education.
Unfortunately, even despite the great advances in modern physical science
which have appeared in modern civilization otherwise, the typical classrooms
of the world, up to the present time, have never been freed of what European
cultures have known as that regressive dogma of Aristotle expressed as the
so-called a-priori presumptions of Euclidean geometry.
This pseudo-scientific, traditionally
Aristotelean a-priorism, is otherwise to be recognized as the systemically
misleading notion of "completion," as that subject was famously treated,
from a positivist standpoint, by the celebrated Göttingen scientist David
Hilbert, as at the beginning of the Twentieth century. That notion of
"completion" has presumed the bounding of the possible practice of mankind
by some set of what are assumed to have been deductively demonstrable
a-priori assumptions, presumptions sometimes differing from bare-bones
Euclid, as in the case of Lobatchevsky's and Jonas Bolyai's assumptions, but
akin to the sophistry of Euclid, as expressed otherwise by deductively
demonstrable a-prioristic assumptions of mere mathematics as such.
Despite such assumptions of the mere mathematicians, the progress of science
demonstrates the contrary to be true. The root of the typical systemic
errors of the mere mathematicians, such as the delusion of a
"zero-technological growth," proceeds by ignoring the fact of the discovery
of new physical principles which seem to "bound" previously known
physical-mathematical systems through new discoveries of relatively higher
physical principles, as Albert Einstein's rather famous, Riemann-based
argument to this effect expresses that notion, and, similarly, the
discoveries of the great Academician V.I. Vernadsky of Russia and Ukraine..
As in the case of Johannes Kepler's uniquely original discovery of the
principle of universal gravitation, as documented in his The Harmonies of
the Worlds,35 systemically competent physical-science practice is
systemically anti-entropic, not only in expressed product, but in respect to
the principled, "Prometheus Unbound" conception of science itself.
Zero-growth such as that of literature's Prometheus Bound, was always
essentially a doctrine taught by slave-masters to their willing slaves.
The best presentation of the systemic features of the distinctions which I
have just identified here, involves the discussion of the contrast of "Type
'B' " minds to those of "Type 'A' ."
The Case of "Type 'B'
"
The contrast between the more popular view, of a "Type A" outlook, and my
own choice of "Type B," came about, originally, in that way. That is the key
to my agreement with Leibniz since that time.
The key to all of Leibniz's most notable
accomplishments, is, that he was a thinker in a "Type B" mode, as to be seen
in the fact of his practice, from somewhere in his early years. We who have
accepted the "Type B" mode as reality, readily share certain affinities.
Sharing this view helped me greatly in understanding how Leibniz thought,
and, later, Riemann.
That development within me had already
fascinated me in my hours spent on study of on primary writings on the
subject of relativity, during my many hours spent in the reading room of the
Boston Public Library during those years before and, briefly, after war-time
military service. The fuller implications of this "hit me" a few years
later. It was that, combined with my induction into management consulting
through my father's activities during the earlier and later 1940s, and to my
very independent views, differing with him, in these matters later on.
Despite the centuries separating our respective lifetimes, I came to know
some essential things, bearing on a science of physical economy, about
Leibniz and Riemann very well, especially those aspects which bear on what I
say here on the specific subject of a science of physical economy. I say
this baldly, so, here and now, because this permits me to cut short, to
essentials, that which I present here as my explanations of certain
preliminaries which I must introduce at this present juncture.
What I have to say here and now, about the coincidences between the thinking
of Leibniz and Riemann and what came to be my own, is rooted in the fact we,
and also quite a number of others, were all rooted in adopting what I shall
outline here, soon, below, as virtually a "Type B" outlook on the universe.
Essentially, on this account, insofar as the discussion touches a science of
physical economy, I can say confidently that Leibniz and I think alike in
such matters as these; if you wish to understand either of us, or also that
aspect of Riemann's work bearing on matters of physical economy, take that
into consideration; it will simplify matters greatly, especially respecting
the matter of the Leibniz infinitesimal which I address in these immediately
following pages.
To avoid any misunderstanding of what might be taken as my particular claims
on this account, my relationship to the work of those scientists is located
essentially within the bounds of the generally underlying principles of the
matter. I say that in the sense that Johannes Kepler's discovery of a
universal principle of gravitation was not a mathematical formulation as
such.
The mathematical formulation which he introduced
in its form, was the footprint which the principle of universal gravitation,
as this was emphasized by Albert Einstein, was understood as a relevant
footprint left upon mathematics, but was not as the empiricists have
insisted, the principle itself. The distinction, as by V.I. Vernadsky, among
the principled categories of the Lithosphere, Biosphere, and Noösphere is
another illustration of just such a significance of the ontological
distinction of universal principles from the mere footprints expressed in
related, merely mathematical formulations.
Once we have accepted the evidence that the impressions which we may
associate with sense-perception are shadows of reality, as that shall be
defined by me, here, from a "Type B" standpoint, rather than self-evidently
what they might appear to be, we avoid all of the principal, usual blunders
which the Eighteenth-and Nineteenth-century cowards such as Abraham de
Moivre, D'Alembert, Jean le Rond D'Alembert, Leonhard Euler, Joseph
Lagrange, Pierre-Simon Laplace, and the sometime plagiarist Augustin Cauchy
perpetrated.36
All of these listed personalities committed
intentional frauds, and did so in defense of the fraudulent claims against
Leibniz by those devotees of the cult of the black-magic specialist Isaac
Newton whose reputation was virtually molded out of something less dignified
than mud, by such as Abbe Antonio S. Conti and his accomplice Voltaire.
Those frauds were frankly motivated, as those hoaxsters themselves argued
for this vew, by the intent to discredit Leibniz's definition of the
"infinitesimal" of the Leibniz calculus.
The fact that Leibniz was uniquely correct on
all points, is the key to competent practice respecting the history of
physical science from his lifetime to the present day, just as those who
deny the originality of Johannes Kepler's original discovery of the
principle of universal gravitation, are either fools, hoaxsters, or simply
people who have learned to sing for their academic suppers.
The most crucial significance of that set of historical facts here, lies in
the ontological implications of Leibniz's identification of the
infinitesimal of the calculus as being real, but real only in the sense of
being a shadow of the physically efficient reality it expressed. Leibniz
had, you see, like Bernhard Riemann and certain others later, what I have
classified, in this report, as a "Type B" mind.
It was those who believed in
sense-certainty, those exhibiting the characteristics "Type A" minds, who
had failed to grasp the underlying reality of the way in which our universe
is organized. Later, as our thoughts turn into the personal exploration of
nearby physical space-time, as to Mars' orbit, that the crucial importance
of this distinction comes to the fore.
However, this is not a matter limited to space-exploration; it is, also,
already the crucial issue underlying the reasons for the presently onrushing
general breakdown-crisis of the world's economy as a whole.
"Type B" & The
Infinitesimal
If, as I have emphasized above, as also in the preceding parts of this
trilogy, the naive perception of sense-experience as a shadow of reality,
rather than reality itself; so, if we seek to portray that sense-experience
in customary mathematical terms, how could such a mathematician point toward
a reality which anything but what he must believe exists only as a shadow of
reality?
Pose that question in the light of Nicholas of
Cusa's rejection of Archimedes' pretending to account for the generation of
a circle by the method of quadrature, or the comparable challenge presented
in treating Kepler's discovery of the generation of the Earth's elliptical
orbit in the "non-linear" terms of "equal areas, equal times," rather than
any implicitly Euclidean, merely mathematical notion of an ellipse.
As I have emphasized during earlier sections of this present trilogy, the
ontological distinction of ideas formulated in "Type A" terms of
"sense-certainty," from actually physical, non-linear ideas coherent with
"Type B," is that the truly competent scientist, or Classical artist,
regards sense-impressions as being merely shadows, or "footprints" of
reality. The distinction is approximately the same as that of formal
mathematical images, from the image of physical curves, such as the catenary
function, and the like.
The "Type A" mental state experiences the shadow
as the reality; the "Type B" mind sees the shadow as just that, and then
seeks the mental-physical image of that which corresponds to the casting of
the shadow. Thus, the systemic distinction between merely formal and
actually physical conceptions such as universal physical principles, such as
Kepler's discovery of universal gravitation as a principle of physical
space-time of Kepler, Leibniz, and Riemann, rather than what Leibniz
demonstrated to have been the mere sense-perception of silly empiricists
such as Descartes.
Such is the distinction of the infinitesimal of the Leibniz calculus. The
empiricist image of physical experience, such as that of Descartes, Abraham
de Moivre, D'Alembert, Lagrange, Laplace, Cauchy, and the Cartesians and
Newtonians, generally, et al., leaves no place for the reality of a universe
whose existence is composed of the quality of physically efficient change,
the quality of true ideas.
Hence, the infinitesimal of the Leibniz calculus,
like the notion of the principle of physical least action generally,
expresses the physically efficient presence of a universal principle of
action, a principle which is physically efficient, but which does not exist
in the presumptions of a Cartesian or like domain of the "Type A" mentality.
So, accordingly, to the extent that the "Type 'A' " mentality regards mere
mathematics as the reality, the actual physical principles of the universe
are expressed as "imaginary." That is key to understanding the fully witting
fraud perpetrated against Leibniz by Leonhard Euler. Euler's fraud, in that
argument, was to avoid the silliness of de Moivre's belief in the
"imaginary," by substituting the sophistry of an actually irrelevant point,
that the existence of the Leibniz infinitesimal is really a matter of
mathematical "smallness," rather than the existentially ontological.
That is to emphasize that true universal
physical principles, such as gravitation as discovered by Kepler, exist
outside the illusory shadow-world of mere sense-certainty.
So, it is crucially relevant to be mentioned here, that the very silly
Abraham de Moivre proposed to his companion D'Alembert, that the magnitudes
associated with the differential of the Leibniz calculus be attributed to
"imaginary" numbers, whereas the sophistry of their somewhat less silly
ally, and witting hoaxster, Leonhard Euler, reduced the issue to one of
"infinitesimal," merely mathematical smallness.
Ironically, de Moivre was right, if only grammatically, in employing the
term "imaginary" as point to something which was, understandably, merely
imaginary to a virtual dumb yokel such as de Moivre or D'Alembert; neither
of those two had a competent conception of what this term "infinitesimal"meant
in the domain of physical reality.
Both had it backwards.
It is the world which is seen by the "Type A"
mentality, which is merely a mathematical-like shadow of actual experience
("the imaginary"), whereas it is, most emphatically ironical, that the true
imagination, such as that of Percy Bysshe Shelley, which embodies the real
world of human historical experience, which is the source of the action on
the historical process which touches reality, rather than merely the domain
of sense-certainty.
Back to Shelley, Again
While mathematics does meet some essential requirements in society's
progress, no system of mathematics as such encompasses actual acts of
efficient human creativity. Creativity lies, indeed, in the domain of the
human imagination. This is shown most readily within the bounds of the
domain of Classical modes of artistic creativity.
For example, the relative lack of rationality of members of society born,
whether in Europe, or, in the Americas, after April 12, 1945, as compared to
relevant leading figures of society born to the members of earlier
generations still living at that time, is chiefly result of the post-war
promotion of the systemic irrationalism of cults such as that of the
existentialist authors of the Authoritarian Personality and of the moral
degenerates of the European Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), produced
the intellectual and moral degeneracy typical among those
existentialist-leaning 68ers who set the pattern for the cultural
degeneration in ideas and practice which the dominant currents among the
"68er" generation (or, better said, "degeneration") have come to represent
as the dominant cultural standard of behavior for the virtual entirety of
their presently still culturally hegemonic in the U.S. Congress and
elsewhere today.
In other words, just as Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote in the concluding
paragraph of his A Defense of Poetry:
"... The person in whom this power resides,
may often, as far as regards many portions of their nature, have little
apparent correspondence with the spirit of good of which they are the
ministers. But even whilst they deny and abjure, they are compelled to
serve that power which is seated on the throne of their own soul."
Shelly referred, thus, still in 1819, to the
period of cultural optimism associated with the cultural optimism associated
with the rise of the American republic.
The same principle of dynamics is encountered in
the opposite type of cultural trend, such as the extremes of moral decadence
expressed by the characteristics of the existentialism of the "68ers."
Today, a comparably radical change in direction of culture has emerged,
opposite to the trend in Europe and the Americas since late Spring 1968.
A movement centered, most notably, among matured
young women centered among such in their fifties today, is typical, as this
stratum is conspicuous as a leading part of the rising tide against the
frankly Hitler-like, fascist characteristics of the current Obama
administration's Larry Summers and the Hilterian-like, pro-genocidal
impulses of the member of the so-called "behaviorist"-economics riff-raff,
of such echoes of the "Hitler T-4" riff-raff , as President Obama's Ezekiel
Emmanuel.
Indeed, in all the better known aspects of human history, the same dynamics
illustrated by Shelley's argument which I have referenced in this report,
prevails as the key to understanding the processes characteristic of
cultures. This the same notion of modern dynamics traced to the dynamis of
ancient Classical Greece; it is the same notion of dynamics which Gottfried
Leibniz expressed as a fundamental principle of any competent modern
science. It is otherwise to be recognized as a general principle of all
competent notions of natural law, whether as the natural law of
physical-science practice, or the law of social processes and their history.
In the development of modern European civilization, for example, dynamics
signifies the notion of universal law, both physical laws, and laws
underlying cultures. The twofold character of this role of dynamics, as
Leibniz defined modern dynamics during his relevant work during the decade
of the 1690s, is most clearly expressed for both physical science and
economy, as for cultural processes generally.
In all respects, the leading role of human
creativity, including physical-scientific creativity is located, not in
mathematics, but in the dynamic role of that power of creative artistic
imagination of Classical music, poetry, drama, and comparable expression of
the Classical visual arts. The exemplary case of the role of Albert
Einstein's violin in inspiring his accomplishments in conceptions of
physical science, is exemplary of these connections.
It is the destruction of the practice the Classical artistic processes under
the influence of post-Franklin Roosevelt existentialism, especially that
destruction in Europe and the Americas, which has been the chiefly
determining influence responsible for the degradation of the economy of
those parts of the world since the death of Franklin Roosevelt, and, most
emphatically, the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, which was
clearly motivated by the attempt to eliminate President Kennedy's refusal to
accept the British intentions for a U.S. war in Indo-China.
In this connection, the notion of Classical poetic irony, which, despite the
depravities of the New York Times style-book, is the key to locating the
origin of physical-scientific and related creativity. It is that quality of
the Classical-poetic imagination which is found only within Classical
artistic composition, which has been the source of guiding inspiration for
all actual physical-scientific and related progress.
Thus, the spread of the radiated, pro-satanic
cult of existentialism, such as the perversions of the so-called "Frankfurt
School," has been the chief cause of the leading incompetencies and explicit
evils experienced by civilization during the "post-Franklin Roosevelt era"
to date. It is the contrary, creative-artistic imagination typical of great
Classical artistic composition, which is the active principle underlying the
greatest achievements in practice of modern physical science. It has been
the suppression of that factor, which has made possible the degradation of
the human condition launched with the death of President Franklin Roosevelt.
Here, we encounter the essential distinction of man from ape, the expression
of the creative powers unique to human species, upon which all progress in
civilization continues to depend. It is this subjective element in human
nature which is the locus of true creativity, in physical science and
otherwise, and thus of the absolute superiority of man over beast.
This is the ultimate secret of success in
economy; this is the indispensable function of Classical artistic culture,
such as that of Abraham Kästner, Gotthold Lessing, Moses Mendelssohn,
Friedrich Schiller, and Percy B. Shelley, which expresses the well-springs
of the distinction of man from beast, including that of progress in physical
science and economy. It is the loss of ties to such Classical culture, which
is the usual root-cause of mankind's depravity.
The attributable "secrets" of human individual creativity are to be found
only in the focus on the subject of the "Type 'B' " personality.
IV. THE "TYPE 'B' " PERSONALITY
The "Type 'B' " personality is defined, simply,
by his or her awareness that sense-perceptions are not, in themselves, the
reality of the experience of sensations, but are in the nature of the
general class of instrument readings.
Thus, just as Keplers uniquely original
discovery of universal gravitation depended upon recognizing the qualitative
distinction of sight of the motion of apparent planetary movements, from the
harmonic characteristics of the qualitative differences in movements of the
notable objects, all such discoveries of a paradoxical sense of kindred
categories of experiences, mark the distinction of reality from what are
merely naive instrument readings; this is the case, whether for the human
sense-organs as such, or for the use of those instruments which extend the
powers of sense-perception into other dimensionalities than those in reach
of the given senses as such.
That power of discrimination among asymmetrical
qualities of sense-experiences, challenges, thus, the specifically human
cognitive powers of the imagination in modes which typify the root form of
creativity, as Kepler's uniquely original discovery of universal gravitation
only typifies this achievement. That experience occurs as the discovery of a
universal principle as being itself an efficiently acting object, an object
which is not in itself merely an experience of sense-perception, but is the
paradoxical form of expression of a principle of nature, a paradox which not
only "encloses," ironically, juxtaposed sense-experiences, but subsumes
relevant categories of experiences dynamically.
That view of matters is, in essence, the mark of the creative human
personality. what is also to be recognized as the imprint of the principle
of the "non-other" of Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa's De Docta Ignorantia, as
this is also typified by the notion of physical, rather than merely apparent
curves, as in Filippo Brunelleschi's use of the catenary as an actually
efficient physical principle for the construction of the cupola of
Florence's Santa Maria del fiore.
This paradox also accounts for the foolish
mistake of the Communist Party of Florence's dangerously blundering
intention (during the late 1980s) of its proposal to fill in those open
parts of that design built into the cathedral's cupola by Brunelleschi. That
Communist Party's error was also a form of ignorance typical of
non-believers in science, in respect to that principle of Cusa's De Docta
Ignorantia which Cusa's follower Leonardo de Vinci presented as the
functional relationship of the physical curves known, respectively, as the
catenary and tractrix, something which a foolish and wicked devotee of Paolo
Sarpi, Galileo Galilei, never could understand, and never could have
understood, that not so much because he was systemically stupid, as he was
motivated by the blinding of his mental powers by his devotion to evil.
Among the chief sources of difficulties in comprehension of economic
processes, is the commonplace tendency of the student, or professional to
place himself, as observer, outside the process he or she is examining. It
is therefore indispensable, to emphasize the fact that the creative mental
powers of the human individual, in that way, are superior, qualitatively, to
any process located within the Biosphere or Noösphere.
This means that we must always recognize that
what we, as people, see the economy doing, must be seen by us in terms of
the effect of what we have done, or failed to do, to that economy. We must
look at the economy as should the astronaut operating the controls of a
space-craft traveling a relativisitic,1-G constant-acceleration-deceleration
flight, from Earth-Moon-orbit, to the Mars-moon-orbit.
In the real world's economy, you are not a Wall Street pool-shark playing
the table; the table, in this case, is playing you, with its response to
what you are doing, or failing to do, to it. What the economy is doing to
us, is nothing different, in the main, than what we have done to it, or have
failed to do to it.
At the judgment-seat in Hell, it is often the
accountant who is hung, again, and again, first, that not so much as
repeated reminders of what might have been, formally speaking, his active
crimes, as, second, for reason of his stubborn indifference to the effects
of the follies of moral omission which he is practicing.
"Back to the books, once more, sir; the rope
is waiting, for you: Timothy Geithner."
The crucial difference here, is that instead of
accepting mere sense-impressions as reality, we must seek out a principle of
the type associated with dynamics, as Leibniz defined dynamics during the
1690s.These principles of dynamics, as defined, then, by Leibniz, will not
merely serve us as being in the assumed form of universal physical
principles, or, more broadly, elementary (universal) principles; these
principles will deliver the payment to you for what you have done, or,
worse, failed to do.
Experience, otherwise, is then read as subsumed, categorically, under the
appropriate selection of such a now-presumed-to-be universal principle; such
is the principle of dynamics, as it appears in its included role in the
prosody of the passage which I have often cited from the concluding
paragraph of Shelley's A Defence of Poetry.
That is also the significance of V. I.
Vernadsky's division of the universe known to him, experimentally, as
composed of the subsuming quality of interrelationship among the
ontologically distinct categories of experience which are identified,
respectively, as in the ascending order of relatively universal authority,
of the Lithosphere, Biosphere, and Noösphere. The knowable authority of the
Creator is then expressed for us as expressed by that still higher universal
principle whch subsumes the entire universe, categorically.
In a related matter, the distinction of the human individual personality, is
that individual's achievement of an immortal identity in personality,
although not in the flesh, as distinct from the lower cases within the
bounds of the Biosphere, and the still lower, categorical case of the
Lithosphere.
That is to say, that the existence of the human
personality is not confined to that which is subsumed as the mortal body,
but, as the history of scientific progress exemplifies this, is a process of
a continuing action of discovery which does not end with the death of the
participation by the mortal discoverer in the continuing process of
discovery; rather, it is implicitly a genetic-like (hereditable), continuing
process of development of discovery, in which the work efficiently done so,
by still mortal individuals, as by the discovery of universal principles,
such as the case of J. S. Bach's system, continues to participate in society
even after that person's decease as a mortal creature: a participation which
is "located" in the relevant dynamic in which that individual has not merely
participated, but has enriched, or, participates under its adoption under a
new dynamic, later.
By this standard, existentialists and their like, such as Martin Heidegger
and Hannah Arendt, are typical of those who die to join the ranks of the
perpetually becoming dead; once each among them, such as the former Nazi
Martin Heidegger, claimed this for himself, he or she has been "thrown"
away, again and again, in perpetuity, as by self-inflicted choice, to become
something which had lived as something no better than an idiot-savant whose
personality had been fabricated, as if by the intention of Bertrand Russell
and his Norbert Weiner and John von Neumann, in California's "Silicon
Valley."
While such wretched persons seem to live, if
only as beasts, as do as the behaviorists associated with the U.S.
Presidential administration of Barack Obama, they move, but, nevertheless,
they are going no-place, but live as beings which have chosen to die without
purpose in the end, to die, so, again, and again, according to the
explicitly stated rule of the Obama team's health-care policies, and that of
Adolf Hitler, too, as if they were no better than barnyard cattle.
This is not to suggest that Classical artistic impulses are wrong in the
same way as those cases of failed specific mathematical formulas associated
with idea of mathematical physics.
The experimental results of what is
called mathematical physics, must be checked, and counter-checked,
reciprocally, with the aid of the impulses of the creative-artistic mind; it
is that mind which persists. All deductive approximations, are systems of
errors in their inherent nature; only a discovery of a universal principle,
such as a universal physical principle, is ever true.
Such sometimes kaleidoscopic interactions of the two, is the reality of a
competent scientific method, and is also relevant for judging Classical
artistic insight. The subsuming relationship between the two, lies
essentially within the domain defined by the Classical artistic imagination,
as this is shown for art by the case of the heritage of Johann Sebastian
Bach's development of Classical counterpoint at the only scientific tuning
of C=256 cycles, a tuning which prevailed among competent singers until
massively financed influence of the morally and artistically degenerate
Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF) took over, more and more, in the course
of the post-World War II period.
I shall show here, that it is those products of the Classical artistic
imagination, which must take over, when the formalism of a mathematical
science has presumed too much, as the exemplary folly underlying the
toleration of what I shall show here as being, actually, a plainly silly,
but widely acclaimed "Second Law of Thermodynamics."
It is the products of the Classical artistic
imagination, as expressed in the form of either science or poetry, which are
the source of the generation of scientific progress as much as valid
artistic revolutions; but, it is the test of application of the inspirations
of the Classical developed artistic mind, which supplies the proof of any
valid revolution in either physical science or Classical artistic
creativity.
It is the attempt to separate the one aspect of creativity, physical
science, functionally, from the other, which leads to failure; it is insight
into the sense of the principle of humanity expressed in Classical art,
which is the key for locating the source of the prevalent wrongness of the
merely mathematical outlook. The two functions, which are usually
distinguished as "art" and "science," are distinct, but, nonetheless,
functionally interdependent, that under a unifying, subsuming physical
principle.
The lack of the sense of the unique value of the
living human soul, as both Hitler's and as President Barack Obama's
similarly evil health-care policies presumes this, has typified the
depravity commonly met in both categories of profession, art and science,
especially, during course of time since President Franklin Roosevelt died.
As Albert Einstein's relationship to his violin illustrates a principle, it
is the creative power of the Classical mode of inherently anti-entropic
artistic imagination, which is the indispensable font of all revolutionary
progress in the condition and practice of a mankind made in the likeness of
the Creator. I shall show here that it is in the lawfulness of Classical
artistic composition and its performance, that the true discoveries of
physical science reside.
Take the case of even backward trends in economy, or even the case of what
is simply technological stagnation, as illustrations of the effect of the
forces of destruction which overtake society when this function of artistic
creativity were stifled, as by the utterly fraudulent, evil, mass-murderous
swindle of the scheme for "cap and trade" today, or, in a relatively milder
degree, by the systemically destructive effects of the blight which
threatened to destroy science under the Eighteenth-century reign of the
British empiricism of the "Isaac Newton" cult.
The Classical artistic imagination to which civilized mankind aspires,
inspires man's reach into a universal reality which is beyond currently
prevalent practice during that period of time; but, the test of the reality
of that imagination occurs in respect to the resulting increase, or failure,
of the physical power of mankind to exist, per capita and per square
kilometer of territory on the surface of the planet, which defines that
which could be regarded as a validated innovation.
It is the outcome of that aspect of both science
and Classical art, which is the juncture of Classical artistic standards of
beauty, as in the case of Brunelleschi's construction of the cupola of Santa
Maria dei Fiori, an outcome which is expressed in the
increase of a culture's potential relative population-density. That which
unifies science and art in that way, presents us with a rule-of-thumb for
defining the unity of progress and beauty.
It is that specific unity which produces, and
attests to the beauty and eternal life of the human individual soul, and
which underlies the motive-forces of all progress in the human condition.
Our Progress to Mars
At the present time, the most relevant point of reference for making this
point clear, is the challenge of preparing the way for the successful
establishment of human travel to, and habitation of our most convenient
choice of a nearby planet, Mars.
If we know that mankind is the kind of universal being which the author of
Genesis 1 attests, could we be content to be such shirking cowards as to
choose to remain a species confined to Earth, for no longer than an
ultimately imperiled human life on Earth remains possible? We now know that
escape to a wider realm in our Solar System is reachable, on principle.
Could we dare to shirk our duties in service to the Creator on this account,
either on Earth, or beyond?
Could we consider the great calamities which may
menace the continuation of livable conditions for human life on Earth, and
sit, squatting and blinking like toads eating flies, here, when we are so
clearly, implicitly assigned to a higher mission in this universe, and even
for the continued existence of mankind?
Or, do we tremble when we think of such suggestions, because we are not
sufficiently assured that such ventures might be possible, or, if possible,
might be an uncomfortable, or expensive experience? Are we like so many of
our misguided fellow-beings, passionately devoted to the appearance of being
in service to those mortal ends of whose very existence we are in doubt?
Is it not the case that, often, as with actual
or would-be tyrants, such as the behaviorists of the current Obama
Administration, that those who appear to be the most arrogant in telling
others what not to do, as the Obama Administration has done until now, are
really cowards, and also either predators obsessed with consuming their
intended prey, or, seeking to conceal their own fearful doubts concerning
even that thought which they pretend to believe the most.
Like our current
Narcissus-in-residence, President
Barack Obama, they do not actually know
what it is that they should wish to see themselves pretending to believe?
Friedrich Schiller and Percy Bysshe Shelley are distinct personalities.
Schiller was a genius almost beyond our power of belief, in his
accomplishments for his time; but, Shelley was touched by the same principle
of genius, with great moments of insight of a kindred quality respecting
insight into the essential nature of mankind.
The accomplishments of the figure who was, in
many respects, the virtual father, or prophet of modern European
civilization, Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, was of a higher importance for all
mankind than either of those two who came later; but, the mold of the
character of all three was, in certain crucial respects, a quality in which
they all participated, dynamically.
The subject-matter to which those three and similar cases point, is the fact
that the subject-matter of mankind can not be found outside a certain union
of the activities associated today with the legacies of such as Nicholas of
Cusa, Johannes Kepler, Pierre de Fermat, Gottfried Leibniz, Bernhard
Riemann, Albert Einstein, and V.I. Vernadsky, for the extraordinary depth
and breadth of their fundamental contributions to a truly universal physical
science; but, at the same time, not only for that reason, but for the reason
that they embody the great principle of Classical artistic composition's
insight into the essential nature of the human individual: as I have already
emphasized repeatedly in this report thus far.
The particular point of greatness of Gottfried Leibniz, to which I referred
in the closing portion of the preceding chapter, is to be recognized in the
deep stroke of genius represented by his discovery of the functional
significance of the concept of the infinitesimal within a physical science
which Leibniz had traced to the discoveries of Johannes Kepler. Leibniz's
discovery on that account was a pure expression of the quality of genius
specific to the "Type 'B' " personality, a quality of genius lacking in all
so-called scientists bred and fed in the relatively bestial, "Type 'A' "
traditions of sense-certainty. True genius is not measurable in itself, but
only in its effect; it is intrinsic.
Kepler had located the actual substance of the real universe, thus, through
that power of imagination which "sees" that reality which has cast the mere
shadows known as sense-perceptions. It "sees" the real universe, which
exists for human knowledge only in the self-conscious development of those
powers of the human individual mind which are reflected in the fact that
universal gravitation, as discovered uniquely by Kepler, had already,
implicitly, defined gravitation as Albert Einstein was to do, as the effect
of a universal physical principle which shows the entirety of the
still-in-the-process-of-being-created universe to be finite, but unbounded.37
Whereas, those who plagiarized, wittingly, the
mathematical conception of the mere effect of gravitation as that had been
originally, uniquely, discovered by Kepler, plagiarists such as the
swindlers who concocted the dubious existence of Isaac Newton, were simply
stubborn unfortunates who did not recognize an actually, quasi-bounding,
universal principle of gravitation at all.
Thus, Leibniz's "infinitesimal," which is the reflection of the principle of
each universal physical principle, lies outside the mere shadows which
reality casts upon the brutish domain of mere sense-perception. This is the
outcome of the case that the experience of sense-perception is merely a
matter of attention to the perceived realities of any true universal
principle's effect (not its actual cause), the concept of the reality of the
infinitesimal, cast upon the mere shadow-world of the sensory domain.
There is nothing properly deemed obscure, or outrageous, in what I have just
written here on the subject of gravitation as a quasi-bounding, rather than
merely the mathematical construction of that which had been provided,
essentially, by Kepler as a product of his essential discovery of the
principle.38
This distinction which I have just underscored here, is immediately more or
less obvious to anyone who examines the proposition of a "Type 'B' "
personality closely.
The Type "B" Identity
The Type "A" mentality presumes a simply direct relationship of the
sense-perceived phenomena to what is considered by that shallow-minded
personality, mistakenly, as to be the actually conceiving mind.
Here lies
the error of mistaking phenomena for physical realities. In contrast to Type
"A," the Type "B" mentality recognizes such phenomena as representing a
shadow which has been cast by the "unseen" real object, as we, like the
Apostle Paul, might see this "in a mirror darkly."
What we experience through the senses, are
merely phenomena, shadows cast, as by reflection, as in the instance of
sense-perception. At that same point, the Type "B" mind says: "Stop right
there! What is that which you claim to know as self-evident; is it something
no more than a shadow which reality has, in some way, cast upon your
agencies of sense-perception?"
Type "B" rebukes "A." So, the modern followers of William of Ockham are to
be rebuked for the evil they have done to humanity generally.
"All competent judgment of experience must
address the paradoxical fact that what you perceive is the effect of
developments upon sense-perception itself, which says nothing about the
intrinsic reality to which your powers of sense-perception are
reacting."
Consider the exemplary case of Kepler's
measurement of gravitation, by testing the perception of the organization of
the universe by means of the contradiction between the evidence of the
telescope and the adducible, harmonic interrelations of the system of
principal Solar orbits.
As in all competent experimental exploration of
matters of physical principle, we must locate expressed physical principles
in terms of mutually contradictory phenomena, such that no perceived
principle will be mistaken for what is suggested by congruent modes of
sense-perception." I do not, personally, promote the dance-form called "The
Tango," since I have never learned to dance in any manner myself; but,
without a relationship between two separate partners, it were an event which
had no noteworthy attraction for the kinds of persons whose tastes I wish to
understand.39
In other words, the Type "B" personality considers the evidence from the
shadow-world of sense-perceptions as paradoxical, and, then, crafts a mental
image of the functional characteristics of the "unseen," real object, rather
than the intrinsically false judgment expressed by taking the evidence of
sense-perception as being a direct representation of reality.
The Type "B" mind has progressed to the state of
the ability to locate reality associated with the object, as existing
primarilyontologicallyin what Leibniz identifies as the categorical
dynamics of the historical situation, a notion equivalent to the ancient
Classical dynamis. So, I have pointed out this same principle as being
presented in the concluding paragraph of Shelley's A Defence of Poetry.
The position of the Descartes whose work Leibniz shows to be foolish, lies
in Descartes' fixation upon mere appearance to such a degree that Descartes
is, as Leibniz emphasized, blind to even the simplest of evidence of
Descartes' own utter incompetence in matters of science.
Thus, the same principle can be witnessed in the role of Classical ambiguity
in poetry and drama, or the system of well-tempered polyphony, contrary to
accursed "elevated pitches," at the pre-existentialist-Romantic,
scientifically critical value of Bachian principles of counterpoint defined
at C=256.
It is the role of the Classical artistic mode of
composition in the use of the evidence of ambiguity for the purposes of
conveying conceptions which exist only in the domain of the imagination,
rather than as customary styles in literal printed-like statements, which
are activities capable of imparting the communication of an actual idea in
Classical artistic composition of any kind, as by the suggested eyes
portrayed in relevant works of Rembrandt, such as the image of the bust of
Homer contemplating the silly, vacuous fop Aristotle.40
It is the search for the practicable truth of
the imagination, which the practice of a science inspired by the creativity
shows, which exists originally only in the domain of the ironies of the
disciplined Classical artistic imagination.
It is the practice of a categorical separation of Classical art and physical
science into two, mutually exclusive categories of action and experience,
which is the root of today's typical fostering of expressed stupidity in
practice of those who believe in such fantasies as monetarist dogmas.
Consider the following, relevant illustration of
this point.
When The Economists
Failed To Create
When we trace out the physical-economic evidence since the time of the death
of U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, we see, beginning with the prompt
reversal of President Roosevelt's intended post-war policy by his nasty
little successor, Harry Truman, there is an evident pattern of destruction
of in Truman's intention to destroy the work of President Roosevelt, an
intention, by Truman, to fail to use the great productive apparatus which
the U.S.A. had been obliged to dedicate to warfare, to its proper function
as a post-war productive apparatus of peace-time goals of human progress:
"swords into ploughshares."
Roosevelt had intended to carry out his post-war
policy, by, chiefly, two mutually interdependent policy-actions. First, the
elimination of all imperialisms, the British imperialism most notably.
Second, the full conversion, and expansion of the vast economic-productive
potential of the U.S. war-machine for the liberation of the subject nations
from under the boot of British and comparable imperial and colonialist
degradations, and for accelerated, science-driven increase of the productive
powers of labor by the U.S. labor force..
Instead of following President Roosevelt's intentions, London and Truman
seized the opportunity provided by President Franklin Roosevelt's untimely
death, for both the British authorship of, and the Truman complicity in the
launching of an intended preparation for nuclear warfare against the Soviet
Union, a perversion which was combined with the re-institution of
colonialism where the war-time Roosevelt administration had already acted to
cancel it.
So, where the British empire and its European
continental accomplices' restored pre-war British imperialism almost as soon
as President Roosevelt was dead, those two anti-Roosevelt actions of what
came to be called "The Cold War," dominated the entire world, from the death
of Franklin Roosevelt, until a point beyond the termination of the Soviet
Union; but, even since 1989-1992, the old habit of foolish Americans'
complicity with British imperialism and British imperialism's genocide in
Africa and elsewhere, has lingered on as the ever-ready-for-relaunching
British imperial intention, as typified by the lingering influence of the
evil former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Blair's Hitler-modelled
NICE health-care policy, still today.
Truman, in particular, not only joined his British masters in supporting
re-colonization of the British, Dutch, French and other colonial and
quasi-colonial systems, but diverted the scientific-productive war-time
resources with which Roosevelt had intended should have been employed to
build up the societies of the newly freed colonials and other victims of
British-led imperialism.
That potential had been intended, so that this
was done by diverting those resources which President Roosevelt had intended
for post-war construction of a post-imperialist world, to the wasteful
service of a mobilization for a war against a Stalin-led Soviet Union, a
Soviet Union which had had no intention of launching the warfare which the
combination of Churchill and Truman intended, that even before then. Truman
and Churchill had officially announced the intention to go to preemptive
nuclear warfare attacks on the Soviet Union, as Bertrand Russell published
this intention in September 1946.
So, similarly, today, an avowed British stooge,
President Barack Obama, has launched a replay of the ruin of the United
States in a long Indo-China war, now, in Afghanistan, today, in his acting
in British imperial interest, and that under the British orders which he has
obeyed like a virtual slave of the monarchy, waving and rattling his own
shackles in pride.
Recall, that the cycle of outrightly shameless U.S. submission to British
imperialism began with the aftermath of the assassination of U.S. President
John F. Kennedy. Recall that, for both the British and for the Wall Street
gang mobilized against Kennedy (as also against France's President Charles
de Gaulle), there were two crucial features in the British policy for
bringing about the general ruin of the U.S.A. through bringing down the U.S.
economy.
One was expressed, typically, as the Wall Street gang's
London-inspired actions against Kennedy in the matter of the steel industry;
the second, immediately more deadly issue of that time, was the British
determination to destroy that U.S. policy which was, supported jointly by
Kennedy, and by Generals MacArthur and Eisenhower: no engagement of the
U.S.A. in "new land wars in Asia."
Look at the shamelessness of the way in which
the British lured the U.S.A. not only by the ever-contemptible Mr. Blair's
launching of the recent long war in Iraq, but an even more insane, Tony
Blair-style long-war, by President Barack Obama, in Afghanistan.
Thus, the vast potential for liberation of the planet from those
British-imperialist-led conditions which had already caused, among other
evils, two World Wars of the post-Bismarck 1890-1945 interval, was diverted,
once more, to its use for threatened and actual warfare, such as the U.S.
engagement in Indo-China, to prevent the ridding of the world from that
lecherous, predatory grip of British imperial monetarism which dominates the
entirety of the world at the present, most calamitous moment in all of the
world history of modern economy.
Worst of all, since the time of Truman's Presidency, most of the world has
believed in that British global strategic policy concocted for the intended
elimination of the United States, of ruining our economy through inherently
depraved, Liberal policies and useless, wasting, and long foreign wars. This
has been a persisting policy trap into which foolish U.S. Presidencies and
the U.S. Congress have often fallen, again and again, especially since the
death of President Kennedy, which has, now, brought the world as a whole to
the precipice of an oncoming general economic and cultural breakdown of the
planet in its entirety.
Thus, most notably, since the assassination of U.S. President John F.
Kennedy, an assassination motivated by both that President's opposition to
British-dictated de-industrialization of the U.S.A. itself, and, more
urgently, by Kennedy's refusal to proceed with London's intention to ruin
the U.S.A, by plunging it into a useless land-war in Asia, the
British-denoted, monetarist empire expressing the design by the wicked John
Maynard Keynes et al., has controlled the leading dynamic of world history,
since then, up to the present moment.
That transfer of power, was actually
accomplished through interdependent developments, such as that assassination
of Kennedy which terrified his successor, President Johnson, into virtual
submission, and thus, brought on the resulting self-inflicted downfall,
through the Vietnam war, of the U.S.A.'s former role as a leading
policy-shaping power in the world, with the eruption of the so-called
"68ers."
The dogma, dictated from the imperial London of the evil
Prince Philip and
his former-Nazi partner Prince Bernhard, both of the pro-genocidal World
Wildlife Fund, have been the most notable sources of those pro-Satanic
doctrines which have induced the currently-in-progress, self-inflicted
destruction of the remains of the U.S. economy, a destruction conducted
under the nominal direction of a British imperial puppet on London's
strings, otherwise known as the Nero-like narcissist, President Barack Obama.
The future of humanity now depends, in the immediate future, on the ability
of relevant social and other forces of the United States, in bringing an end
to the virtual high treason against both the United States and even the
Creator Himself, which the current, pro-satanic, British-crafted, genocidal,
Hitler-like health-care policies of the Tony Blair-guided Obama
Administration represent. We must now learn our history, while we still have
a fast-fleeting moment of opportunity to bring an urgently needed change
about.41
To bring ourselves to doing what we must do on that account, some rapid
learning of a truthful account of our nation's history, is indispensable,
contrary to the versions of such wretched organs as the alien ideologies of
mass-propaganda instruments such as the New York Times and Washington Post.
That much just said, now return to those principles of economy on which our
republic was founded.
The Foundations of
Creativity
As I have already emphasized, the medium of creativity is essentially the
combination of the natural association of Classical poetry with Classical
bel canto modes of speaking and singing, and with the economic practice of a
physical science premised on modern scientific principles developed, chiefly
within globally extended European culture, since the work of Brunelleschi
and Cusa.
The importance of the violin for Albert Einstein
as a scientist, illustrates this point, in one way; the lack of genuine
creativity among university-trained prospective scientists who have fallen
under the post-World War II influence of "popular" anti-Classical,
existentialist cacophony in poetry and song, is a compelling illustration of
the way a loss of that degree of both scientific and related creativity and
morals which existed prior to even the death of President Franklin
Roosevelt, has vanished from among even most among the university-educated
specialists in scientific matters, respecting scientific creativity.
What had happened to bring about this post-Franklin Roosevelt defect in the
Twentieth Century European language-cultures, is especially notable under
the current reign by the generation of "the 68ers" born since the close of
World War II; as, in earlier periods of modern history, such as post-William
Shakespeare period under James I, a similar, downward cultural trend had
emerged afresh in English culture with the accession of that James I, and,
most remarkably, similarly, in the aftermath of both the succession of
William and Mary and the death of Queen Anne, and with a more remarkable
depravity known as Eighteenth-Century under Walpole, George I, and their
successors.
This pattern of increasing depravity following
that of the Satanic cults of "The Age of Walpole," is especially notable
since that February 1763 Peace of Paris which established the British East
India Company as already an empire in its own right, and more so from the
1782 establishment of the British Foreign Office as a nest of the collection
of freaks deployed by Lord Shelburne. So, we have the continuing outcomes,
today, of the British Empire proper, which was launched under the successive
reigns of Shelburnes lackey Jeremy Bentham and Benthams protege Lord
Palmerston, at the British Foreign Office.
As I have repeatedly cautioned the readers, all globally extended European
imperialism, is essentially an expression of the evil called monetarism, as
that was understood and identified by Rosa Luxemberg 42 and the
U.S.A.'s Herbert Feis, essentially the present-day monetarism of John
Maynard Keyenes which was brought into the U.S. Government's practice, at
the death of President Franklin Roosevelt, by Winston Churchill's captive
American performing clown, U.S. President Harry S Truman.
Classical poetry, and its expression in music crafted in the heritage of J.
S. Bach, is crucial here. For sundry reasons which need not be elaborated in
their full depth here, the subject of creativity prompts us to those
leading, internationally influential, modern language cultures associated
with creativity in use of language in European civilization generally, which
have been Italian bel canto and the influence of Italian on German, largely
because the principles of bel canto musicality have been permitted to exert
a stronger hold on the use on the shaping of the inherent prosody of the
literate expression of those languages for their serious function as the
prosody of Classical artistic languages employed in Classical musical
performance, with effects of this shown most clearly in the Classical song
of those cultures, even in those circles associated with devotion to a
tradition of Classical culture.
That is to say, that the literate use of those
languages has had the strongest influence on both those artistic and
scientific cultures. In the United States, relics of the English Classical
usages and, German during much of the Twentieth Century, have supplied some
significant checks to the moral corruption pouring out of Nineteenth and
Seventeenth Century England, especially the corruption spread since the
reign of Queen Victoria and her monstrous son and successor.
This role of language in culture generally, has been crucial since the
beginning of what became the U.S.A. French was most significant for science
until the effects of the Jacobin Terror, while German was the leading
foreign cultural influence in science from the 1820s onward, as the U.S. and
Soviet space programs attest, even during the early decades of the immediate
post-World War II period..
Against that broadly described background in general, there was the
destruction of both Classical poetry and decent music, with the advent of
the Truman Administration and beyond, even that retained among our
well-educated classes. This took over the direction of our culture,
especially since the eruption of the highly adulterated, existentialist
strata among the "68ers" from their childhood and adolescence, a cultural
paradigm-shift which has marked the moral and intellectual breakdown of the
reigning culture of the U.S.A. itself.
California-centered, and related "up-talk,"
whose bad effects are exceeded only by the presence of more "smashed" than
"broken," brutish cadences of that son-of-a-Nazi Governor, Schwarzenegger,
who is only one typical case of those modalities which tend to be the most
destructive influence among the relatively more literate strata of the
recent adult generations.
The most relevant of the characteristic features of Classical poetry, and
therefore song and Classical contrapuntal exposition, is expressed in such
typical forms as the literate use of rubato (such as comma-cued rubato in
written text), when this is employed as a device of irony in the uttering of
poetry and literate prose. It is the model of Classical poetry, as England's
William Empson draws attention to this matter in the use of the English
language, as in that 1947 edition of his Seven Types of Ambiguity which I
encountered that same year.
It is this function of ambiguity in both the
composition and uttering of Classical poetry, and also Classical modes in
composing and uttering literate prose, which touches the most crucial aspect
of the role of the imagination in invoking the quality of creativity which
is echoed by the act of discovery of validatable hypothesis in physical
science. It is that notion of hypothesis, so expressed, which is the
essential, even indispensable contribution of Classical poetry to
fundamental scientific progress among scientists enjoying a Classical
development of their personal character in respect to matters of artistic
composition.
The significance of such practice of prosodic irony is the inherent power of
both artistic and scientific creativity, which led themselves most
specifically to the creative expressions of the human mind.
The intelligent citizen demonstrates his morality, especially in most
troublesome times, in relying on Classical modes in irony.
The synonym for creativity in science, is the sense of irony conveyed by
ambiguity in Classical artistic composition and its performance, as Albert
Einstein's violin served his role in science..
That point is illustrated in the matter of performance of the Classical
aria, in which the performer must seem to have created a new, ironical
meaning for a word or two, as needed to convey the special irony of the
relevant situation. This is more readily illustrated for purposes of
discussion of this point by examining the varieties of irony which may be
expressed as innuendo by a very slight element of surprise in the relevant
utterance, or touch of a passing suggestion of a gesture. There lies the
difference between a mass-produced, as if squirted into the mold, plastic
statue, and a genuinely original work of Classical artistic composition.
Similarly, use "irony" in place of "ambiguity." Or, refer again, to
Rembrandt's presentation of what was apparently the scrutiny of Aristotle by
the bust of Homer.
In physical science, the escape from the trap of a formal mathematical, or
kindred expression, is the introduction of irony, as any really knowledge
and experienced professor in scientific matters could demonstrate. The role
of the university academic as, sometimes, an amateur comedian, has its dark
side, but, sometimes, a most pleasing, and also more truthful treatment of
the material being presented.
So, quickly, then, in passing:
"To be?" [pause, change of voicing], "or,"
[pause/rubato/ to the measured beat] "not to be...."
The irony is to be subtle, but be made powerful
by the ensuing, rythmic parade of ugly consequences, arrayed by Shakespeare.
The form is dictated by the content, not the other way around. In such
matters, I am certain that the matured Shakespeare committed few errors. He
says what he means, which should be said with an understanding of the
ironies with which he had intended to say it.
For that Hamlet, the charades are approaching their end. His doom, rooted in
not only his personal moral corruption, but that of his entire culture, is
clear to him. The end is in sight, and it is a horrid one, as it is to
unfold in the modulated remainder of that drama. This must be conveyed, or
the performance were an intellectual dud. Shakespeare understood history as
an expression of dynamics, not soap-opera.
How well that Shakespeare, by contrast with his Hamlet, composes an image of
a series of wretchedly self-doomed nations, with his Celtic tragedies and
his Hamlet! Why should be do otherwise, but write to warn of worthless
causes of self-damned fools, since the time Christopher Marlowe had been
murdered by political assassins in a tavern? What has Shakespeare to say,
then, to the people of Britain, then, with wretched Bacon still loose, and
his profession as published author had been cut short in favor of silly
writers? How much, thus, was Shakespeare able to tell us of the nature of
the fate of England in that time?
It was a lot!
He did well on that account, even if this
achievement could be known again only after the Germany circles of Abraham
Kästner had brought Shakespeare back to life, in English, by way of German,
thus rescuing Shakespeare's mortal works' from deadly decadence at English
hands, to remind us who think of real history, what it had all had meant.
Some among us who share English ancestry, remember that, still today.
The principle which is served by reference to that way of thinking
characteristic of Classical poetic irony, is the imagination. In the irony
of what is competent Classical poetry, as in the struggle with the attempted
performance of Classical musical compositions, as in the case of such as
Albert Einstein, we experience the standpoint of the Type "B" state of mind.
This is, for example, the state of mind of Gottfried Leibniz, in locating
the superior implications of the concept of dynamics for the treatment of
the subject of related bodies interacting within the subsuming, dynamic
domain. Here, the Leibniz infinitesimal is located in the real world, as
opposed to the fictitious world which those enemies of Leibniz's work, those
of the Cartesian faction of Abbe Conti and Voltaire, presented to their
dupes, in their embittered fear of the Leibniz infinitesimal.
Mathematics may express an imprint left by scientific insight, after the
fact, but the discovery of any principle occurs in that domain of the
imagination inhabited by Classical poetry and music.
This is the precious
moment of creativity which the Classical-poetic powers of the imagination
add to the dish served. Here, we meet the rigor which the Classical poetical
form, and its musical and poetic expressions, supplies, which is the domain
of the real physical universe in which the actuality of the physically
efficient infinitesimal lies.
Now, turn to the most efficiently evil of all depraved cultural influences
on economy, politics, and Classical culture today, the influence of the
belief in the hoax taught as a "Second Law of Thermodynamics."
Entropy: For Example
So, now turn our eyes to evil, to a crucial matter of physical science, to
the widely taught, and also widely believed classroom fraud, which has
become known as the doctrine of a "Second Law of Thermodynamics." Without
understanding that fraud, it were not possible to provide a competent
physical-scientific basis for a study of the principles of economy.
If and when that fraud is examined in the context of the typical,
persisting, ontological failures of modern classroom mathematics since the
death of Gottfried Leibniz, it can be quickly ascertained on premises which
I have already presented up to this point, that the source of this widely
held, nonsense-belief in a "second law," has its principal roots in the type
of argument raised against the then deceased Gottfried Leibniz, an attack
raised by the Eighteenth-century cult-group which had been organized under
the direction of master-hoaxster Abbe Antonio S. Conti and his accomplice
Voltaire, a group which had included the those whom I had identified here
earlier, as including such followers of that cult as Abraham de Moivre and
D'Alembert ("imaginary numbers"), the witting fraudster Leonhard Euler,
Euler's dupe Joseph Lagrange, and their followers among the early
Nineteenth-century notables of fraudulent science as Pierre-Simon Laplace of
"three-body problem" uncertainties, and Laplace's accomplice, the sometime
plagiarist of the work of Niels Abel,43 Augustin Cauchy.
It is essential that, for these purposes, we treat these fallacies as
essentially ontological, rather than merely formal in character. Since the
practical issues of economy are intrinsically ontological in the final
analysis, rather than formal, no competent science of economy could be
developed without, first, addressing the ontological issues, rather than
merely formal issues, which must be identified as ontological issues
intrinsic to the implications of the classifications of physical as,
respectively, the Noösphere, the Biosphere, and the Lithosphere, in that
order of descent from the, functionally, physical superior, to the inferior.
The notable, and still highly relevant issue at conflict in the attack on
the work of the then deceased Leibniz by Conti et al., is the matter of the
existence of what Leibniz had defined as the "infinitesimal" of the
calculus. Clinically, Augustin Cauchy was, and remains a notable, and
influential representative of what had begun as London's repertoire of not
actually scientists, but "science dilettantes of the Royal court, who
happened to be also, anti-Kepler, anti-Leibniz fanatics who had no actual
position within actual science to lose, and who employed the sophistry of
merely formal, a-priorist presumptions to uphold that ontologically
fraudulent perversion of the Leibniz calculus to which I have referred
earlier.
Since they were not dependent on actual
scientific achievements, they could say pretty much whatever their
gossip-circles might choose, such as that specialist in black-magic
gibberish, Isaac Newton, as being a genius, by reason that which Newton
himself never actually knew.
Hence, the rather typical Twentieth-century secondary and university student
being introduced to mathematics, and to what was passed off as an
introduction to the calculus in particular, was most frequently a victim of
Cauchy's ontological hoax on this account. By-products of that same hoax
turned up in a related role in the work of the Rudolf Clausius (1822-1888),
Hermann Grassmann (1809-1877), et al., who "fathered" the common
Nineteenth-century version of the anti-Gauss, anti-Dirichlet, anti-Riemann,
reductionist thermodynamics of Clausius, Grassmann, Kelvin (1824-1907),
James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879), et al.44
This in turn, became the launching-point for the
radically reductionist "mechanics" of Ernst Mach (1838-1916) and Ludwig
Boltzmann (1844-1906), which was superseded by the more savagely radical
hoax of Bertrand Russell's Principia Mathematica, and by Russell's
consequently degrading influence during the 1920s Solvay Conferences, and
the consequent role of Russell's brainwashing in producing that particular
extreme of corruption of modern science associated with the hoaxsters
Professor Norbert Weiner and John von Neumann.45
The underlying issue so posed for consideration here, is precisely that of
the systemic (physical, rather than mathematical) difference between a
mentality organized according to "Type 'A' " and that of "Type 'B'," the
same point of crucial difference which I had already set forth here earlier.
The dates of births and deaths of these referenced figures of the Eighteenth
and Nineteenth centuries, are notable for reasons located within the
indispensable role of the ontological principle of dynamics, as defined by
Leibniz during the 1690s, in the political histories of cultures and
science. The interconnected history of the politics of science and artistic
cultures since Solon, Thales, the Pythagoreans, and Plato, to the present
day, has a common theme and thread of conflict throughout.
Intervals within the history of culture in
general, and scientific opinion, in particular, are dominated by a subsuming
notion of a principle, corresponding to the function of a dynamic, or, the
equivalent, a hegemonic cultural assumption underlying the consequent
distinctions between generally accepted and generally non-accepted opinions.
The effect of such habits is equivalent to the effect of a widely
influential a-priori presumption. Compare my remarks on the concluding
paragraph of Percy Shelley's A Defence of Poetry.
That theme is the reign of the maritime imperialist form of Mediterranean
and broader cultural domination by that form of monetarism, from the defeat
of the Persian Empire's attempt to subjugate the Mediterranean littoral and
to crush Egypt in favor of Tyre, to the present day of the hegemony of the
British empire sprung from the Venetian roots of the capture of the monarchy
of England's Henry VIII by Cardinal Pole, Thomas Cromwell, et al.
However to understand the unfolding of the successive phases of that
millennial process of see-saw-ed development, up to the present day, we must
distinguish roughly datable periods of change in the conscious opinion of
itself, by each among a set of conflicted, formally dynamic patterns in
culture. Generally, most of the notable factions and their leading figures
of a certain span of time, are dangled, as if they were puppets on
ideological strings, from the specific dynamic which subsumes and controls
its subjects ontologically.
There are also marked periods, of rarer cases in which an individual, since
as Brunelleschi, or, more notably, Nicholas of Cusa, Kepler, Leibniz,
Benjamin Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, or Franklin Roosevelt, shapes the
specific quality of the dynamic of his, or her time. The distinguishable,
apparent clusters of leading individual opinion, in, for example,
mathematics, science, and artistic cultural trends, must be considered in
light of the specific kind and period of dynamics by which they are
subsumed.
For just this reason, the trio of Bernhard
Riemann, Albert Einstein, and V.I. Vernadsky are still representative of the
leading kernel of scientific thought of the entire era of the followers of
Cusa, Kepler, and Leibniz, from the Fifteenth-century Renaissance to the
present day. What often appears to be the kaleidoscopic shifts within that
framework must be approached in the specific manner, the standpoint of
dynamics, as I have indicated here.
The core of the issue here, today, in that connection, is the following.
Back to the matter of "Type 'B."
To illustrate the crucial point, simply recognize that the "Type 'A' "
reaction to the same real event as to "Type 'B'," juxtaposes the shadow
(sense-perceptual Type "A") in opposition to the contrasting reality
(physical Type "B"). The most convenient approach to showing the difference
lies in what de Moivre and D'Alembert identified as the subject which they
named the "imaginary."
It is de Moivre's view which is merely
imaginary. The "life" of the event is located in what de Moivre's misjudges
as the "imaginary." This, de Moivre's folly is what Clausius and Grassmann
would mistake, approximately a century later, for the reality of the ongoing
real process. Here lies the systemic root of the intrinsic incompetence of
"The Second Law."
So, the foolishness of Clausius, Grassmann, Kelvin, et al., was not a form
of nonsense original to them. It was the same foolishness which accounts for
the failure of Brunelleschi's rivals to secure the construction of the
cupola of Santa Maria del fiore. It was, in that case, the incompetence of
the Aristoteleans exposed by the achievements in practice of not only
Brunelleschi, but of Cusa's followers Leonardo da Vinci and Kepler, against
the incompetence of Galileo later, and the contrasting achievement of the
followers of Kepler, such as Leibniz, Riemann, Einstein and Vernadsky.
Most simply stated, the organization of the universe, as the relevant
evidence shows this to us today, is an evolutionary impulse which carries
processes from a relatively lower, to higher state of organization, as from
the abiotic, through the living, and into the human-cognitive.
The progress from marsupials to mammals, to
human living beings with their associated cognitive powers, is no more than
typical. In methods in mathematics corresponding to representation of such
lower to higher forms of evolution, the ontological significance of the
combination of the Leibniz infinitesimal and dynamics is primary.
The contrary view, that of the disgusting, so-called "Second Law," is not a
derivative of physical science, but of social prejudices which are
thoroughly documented as corresponding in origin to specifically, morally
deranged social doctrines consistent with the image of Aeschylus' Olympian
Zeus, a doctrine known to the ancient Greek of Aristotle's time as "the
oligarchical principle" of the imperialist doctrine of that time.
This has been the prevalent social-political
doctrine from such parts of history as ancient Babylon, or, the kindred
depravities of all European imperial systems from the time of the monetarist
policies expressed in the Peloponnesian War through the British monarchy of
Elizabeth and Philip today.
This oligarchical principle is the dogma
associated with the persecution of Prometheus by the Olympian Zeus in
Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, as by frankly Satanic British imperial figures,
especially Fabians, such as the most evil men of the Twentieth Century:
Bertrand Russell, and the more imaginative H.G. Wells.
Entropy & A Hilbert
Paradox in Economy
At this point, that said, now turn your attention to certain implications,
which are relevant to our subject here, of what is readily identified for us
here as "The Hilbert Paradox."
Start with a reference to the incompetence for which both of that pair of
Bertrand Russell's ideological lackeys, the Professor Norbert Weiner and
John von Neumann, who were booted out of Professor David Hilbert's Göttingen
program, separately, in different intervals of lapsed time.
They were
ejected, by Hilbert, both for treating what Hilbert had identified in his
celebrated address to the A.D. 1900 Paris conference of mathematicians, for
reason of their utmost incompetence, and, in von Neumanns case, also moral
failings. Among the twenty-three, named Problems listed in Hilbert's1900
Paris address, the most important for our consideration here, remains, to
the present day, the Sixth on that list, treating the subject of the role of
mathematical formalism in the treatment of the axioms of physics: I refer to
that as "the fallacy of presumed a-priori completeness."
This Sixth problem has persisted as his most
significant failure to date.
This was a case in which the nature of the problem had already been
essentially resolved by Riemann's work, as it had been already situated,
with proper, full competence, by Riemann, as Riemann did, so very neatly, in
the concluding sentence of his 1854 habilitation dissertation, on "the
department of physics." That is the Riemann argument, on the subject of "The
mathematical treatment of the axioms of physics." which takes us most
quickly to the center of the formal problems of development of a competent
method for treatment of the subject of a science of economy today.
Here, on this Sixth Problem, the otherwise rigorous Hilbert's argument as a
positivist, formal mathematician, is a systemic failure in physics, and,
therefore, also economics, for reasons I shall indicate now. For our
purposes, in treating that topic here, I turn your attention to, chiefly,
what I have selected the issue on which Hilbert's entire approach breaks
down for, in particular, the matter of a conception of the principles of a
competent theory of physical economy.46
The source of that failure by Hilbert lies in his resistance to breaking
with the effect of certain wrongful, ancient doctrines, wrongs systemically
akin to those of Aristotle's treatment of the most elementary assumptions of
formal-scientific belief, a set of failed assumptions which has persisted,
together with many of their anciently associated effects among beliefs, up
through the present time.
Hilbert's program was, otherwise, bold, and, in parts, brilliant; but it had
that central, systemic flaw which I have emphasized as its failing here: a
tendency toward a mechanistic view of the universe, which a typical
consequence of any belief in an abstractly formal, reductionist mathematics:
in other words, its submission to the underlying axiomatic presumption of
what I have identified as the fallacies inherent in a submission to a goal
of conformity with the parameter of the "Type 'A' " mind.
That weakness in Hilbert's method becomes
clearly the source of a serious error of a type relevant to that
subject-matter of physical economy under consideration in my report here; it
is in the case of the Sixth Problem which he lists, and its included
references to those mechanistic positivists, such as Ernst Mach and Ludwig
Boltzmann, whose rank of, briefly, currently leading authority preceded the
absurd extremes of Bertrand Russell's centrally underlying presumptions in
the Principia Mathematica,
I shall now explain those connections. For this purpose, I employ a
reference to a proximate beginning of the history of that subject-matter, in
what is called today the ancient Classical Greek civilization. For my
purpose here, I concentrate on the effects of the Peloponnesian War, and on
the consequences of the subsequent death of the Plato who is the key figure
among his peers of his time, such as Archytas, in considering the ancient
foundations for competence in modern science.
Dealing with this matter in historically formal terms, the passage from the
deaths of two great scientific geniuses of that time, Archytas 47
and Plato, to the corrupting influence by the reformed, Delphic Sophistry of
Aristotle, marks the conclusion of an historical interval, a concluding
moment defined as being a systemically tragic break in the intellectual life
of what we commonly refer to as Classical Greek civilization, a faulty
tradition which remains today one of the most crucial tragedies in the
history of European civilization as a whole.
Certain implications of that past time may be best approached today, from
the specific standpoint of the physical economist, as I do here..
This remark by me is not intended to imply that there were no great
achievements in European culture during the several centuries after the
death of Plato, prior to the establishment of the Roman Empire. Rather, my
remark must be seen in the light of what Leibniz was to identify, about 2045
years after the death of Plato, as dynamics, the modern echo of the ancient
Classical notion of dynamis of Plato's time,. So, I have identified the
historical significance of modern dynamics in cultures, in my discussion of
the implications of Percy Bysshe Shelley's A Defence of Poetry, above.
The issue of this break, which was marked by the judicial murder of Socrates
and the subsequent death of Plato, was the issue typified by what Aeschylus,
the great tragedian of that preceding period of Classical Greek history, had
identified, most emphatically, with recurring references to both the great
folly which had been both the subsuming tragedy of the entire span of the
Trojan War, earlier, with the image of the Satanic figure of the Olympian
Zeus, and, to that ancient, and evil, Asian adversary of European maritime
and related civilization, an evil embodied within Greece itself in the form
of the ancient Apollo-Dionysus cult of Delphi.48
Presuming consideration of what I have published on the relevance of that
subject-matter at an earlier point in this presentation, the crucial issue
for us in this location, today, is the following.
First, the entirety of the history of what has become the globally extended
form of specifically European civilization, since the period leading
immediately from the interval between the defeat of the Persian Empire's
failed maritime ambitions, and, also, since the Peloponnesian War, has been
the reign over what has become, since, globally extended European maritime
(e.g., Mediterranean maritime culture) as a whole, by that maritime system's
combined adoption, and superseding of a previously existing, inland-based
form of imperial system known as the Asian model of monetarism dating, for
example, in modern knowledge, from evidence of the nature of the decline and
fall of the physical economy of Sumer.
A mythical "god," called "money," is created, under whose reign all peoples
are made subjects, a power placed above each and all the real power which a
people of a particular national or comparable culture might have chosen for
themselves. In short, "globalization," "world government," "a new Tower of
Babel," like that being attempted under the flag of the liberally perjured,
and babbling Tony Blair et al., presently.
This sophistry-ridden form of the European maritime habit since that time,
has promoted the superstition known today, variously, as the form of sodomy
of "free trade," or "empire," the implied belief that there is only one true
god, implicitly the notorious "Satan," the nature of which is expressed as
the reign of a system of money and monetarist practices over nations.
All true empires in a now globally extended form
of European civilization's history, have been essentially maritime-cultural
forms of what have been, historically, a maritime culture's species of
monetary systems, centered originally in the Mediterranean, but, gradually
shifting to the Atlantic, and, thence, to reign, through monetarism, over
the world as a whole, that still at the present moment.
That monetarist system, is the same one which is
presently disintegrating, a system which could disintegrate into a condition
of terminal systemic bankruptcy, almost completely, by its own recent and
presently continuing efforts of the British imperial influence, as early as,
or earlier than the close of the present calendar year: a general
breakdown-crisis of all of the world's nations and peoples considered in
their entirety.
That is the contingency against which I continue to act, as I do here, to
attempt to prevent it from coming upon us.
Our task, which I present for adoption here, must be our choice of working
to establish, quickly, a form of a fixed-exchange-rate system (a credit
system in Alexander Hamilton's sense of the U.S. Federal Constitution) among
respectively sovereign governments from among a set of selected leading and
associated nation-states, a credit-system crafted and maintained to conform
to a physical-economic standard, rather than a monetarist system, which will
create that which replaces the reign of those diseases represented by all
presently pre-existing forms of monetarist systems, by eradicating, and
replacing them entirely through acting upon the fact of the systemic
bankruptcy of the entire monetary systems of the world presently, that most
clearly since July-September 2007.
This systemic reform must be conducted through
the actions on behalf of common interest, as common interest is to be
expressed by a particular set of the world's, respectively, perfectly
sovereign nation-state republics.
This reform, the junking of the present world monetary systems, in favor of
a network of sovereign national credit-systems, simply carries to its
already implicit goals, the notion of a credit-system as specified by
Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and the related specifications within
the U.S. Federal Constitution, rather than an intrinsically monetarist
system
This urgently needed, immediate reform expresses the implied goal of the
true patriots of Europe since the time of Plato's implied declaration of war
against the cult of Delphi. What must be eliminated is what has been classed
as, chiefly, a monetarist pestilence, such as the legacy of the cult of the
monetarist power of Delphi, which reigned through and beyond the lifetime of
that Delphic high priest and, therefore, chief liar, Plutarch, as this
practice was extended beyond the time of the old Roman empire, later as,
briefly, under the Julian the Apostate who served as the suggested model for
selecting pagan religions recommended to Lord Shelburne by Eduard Gibbon.
The pagan tradition of pantheism in imperial
Rome of Augustus, Tiberius, et al., persisted. as under, and thence, was
echoed in the reign of the feudal and modern expressions of
Venetian-centered, monetarist usury, and, in effect, under the presently
hegemonic reach of the monetarist system centered on the British empire,
still today.
To that end, the U.S.A.'s history has enjoyed the authority of having been
developed in a constitutional form unique to itself, as an alternative to
the oligarchical forms of monetary imperialism which had reigned still in
Europe, as they do there still today. Unfortunately, the disease of an
oligarchism-polluted Europe, pursued some those Europeans who, like the
representatives of the British East India Company from 1763 onward, had been
moved by the contrary intention of creating a new, oligarchism-freed nation
in the Americas.
The enemy of our United States has remained as a
European oligarchy, chiefly a nominally British one, in the image of the
Lord Shelburne's British East India Company, which has repeatedly attempted
to gobble us up, as under this most unfortunate recent reign of a virtual
would-be Emperor Nero, a British imperial puppet, a classical Narcissus, a
new, mass-murderous, likeness of the would-be Emperor Nero, called President
Barack Obama. For that, it is the British monarchy, as under its
Hitler-tainted Edward VIII, not that virtually hypnotized "zombie," the
intellectually impaired Barack Obama, which is the chief culprit of record
in this affair.
When considered in that historic context, the root of the failure of
Hilbert, is, as I shall how here, that error then reflected, most clearly,
in his brief treatment of what he adopted, in A.D. 1900, as what he
identified as his "Sixth Problem," is a reflection of an infection of modern
mathematics practice with that European oligarchical corruption of
scientific practice, including the promotion of the kind of policy-thinking
which has dominated most of the leading currents in the post-Franklin
Roosevelt U.S.A..
I certainly do not blame Hilbert for all that; but, I do emphasize, that is
it the failure, respecting his Sixth problem, by a Hilbert, for whom I have
serious respect otherwise, is what I am addressing in this immediate part of
the present chapter.
He fell, in this instance, into that mechanistic trap represented by the
type of science-degenerates typified by mechanistic cult associated with
Ernst Mach, Ludwig Boltzmann, et al., which had prepared the way an even
much worse pollution than their own, for exactly that same ultimate,
abysmal, superseding scientific decadence of Bertrand Russell's Principia
Mathematica, the exact same decadence which has dominated the post-Franklin
Roosevelt world, up to the presently ongoing general breakdown-crisis of
global civilization as a whole.
To be fair to Hilbert, Russell's piece echoed a specific decadence which
Hilbert himself later came to abhor, at least in part, after such brief
associations with those wretched products of the Bertrand Russell school of
the Principia Mathematica, Norbert Weiner and John von Neumann. Hilbert
himself quickly found this pair, in each case, rightly, too disgusting for
his taste for him to continue to endure.49
However, this included an embarrassment, as
caused by von Neumann, which Hilbert had helped to set for himself by his
own clinging to defense of the a-priori fraud of the Aristotelean
abomination which is the same Euclidean a-priori presumptions implicit in
the work of the mechanistic positivists Mach and Boltzmann.
This kind of paradox, of an important scientist, such as Hilbert, who has
occasionally fallen into some of the varieties of intellectual cesspools
represented by such reductionists as the devotees of that silly witch-doctor
Isaac Newton, or, later, the positivist cults, or, as in the case of the
broken spirit of a tortured, once brilliant Georg Cantor, illustrates such
cases.
That problem is not uncommon, still today, among
some leading scientists with whom I have past occasion to cooperate; it is
relatively commonplace. In respect to Hilbert's confusion of the
systemically corrupt Euclidean or similar geometries with physical science,
has tended to impel the victims of such persuasion, to treat such follies as
those as being presumed to be included even in the mathematical wellspring
of science, as Hilbert's own program implies this tendency. This has had
specific kinds of radiated consequences, in science instruction generally.
Hilbert has been no exception to the list of victims with a certain element
of complicity of their own.
At the same time, this disorientation by them, presents an issue of crucial
importance in the field of my leading expertise, a science of physical
economy: hence my emphasis on the effects of the ideology which Hilbert's
disorientation contributes to the field of political-economy.
Consider the relevant case of the Aristotlean version of a "God is dead"
dogma regurgitated, later, by Friedrich Nietzsche, which had been spread,
earlier, in the time leading into the Roman imperial crucifixion of Jesus
Christ, a dogma premised on the a-priorism of Aristotle's devotee Euclid.
Aristotle's "god," as Philo of Alexandria denounced Aristotle theologically
on this account, expresses, implicitly, the same pathetic streak otherwise
known to legend as the Olympian Zeus of Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound. The ban
on "fire" which was attributed to that Zeus, should have warned such fellows
as even Ernst Mach, of a bad smell in the Aristotelean root of Mach's own,
as also Russell's more radical variant on the Paolo Sarpi's adopted cult of
Ockhamite logical positivism.50
Euclidean and kindred geometries are the true,
pro-satanic quality of religious belief of the worshipers of the Delphic
cult. It could not be otherwise; each person's religion is, ultimately, in
practice, what he or she believes to be the principle of the continuing
organization of the universe, and, therefore, also the law of his or her
society. Thus , do empires create their implicit "state religions," such as
monetarism, in their own chosen, pantheonic image. That is the actual
identity of the god which the true believer in each image worships in the
ultimately miserable practice of his, or her own life.
To treat this interim topic, this case of Hilbert's work, for its essential
role in this report as a whole, the following two leading points to be
summarized here.
First; Despite the relevant, preceding developments in modern physical
science, Hilbert's treatment of those mathematical problems which he
identified in his 1900 address, is flawed by the way in which it is
permeated by a-prioristic presumptions which were the same, hereditarily
systemic errors modeled upon that which had been expressed as the
Aristotelean/Euclidean perversions mustered earlier against the competent,
ancient Greek, Egypt-rooted mathematical-physical science of the
Pythagoreans and Plato.
The latter competence is typified by the work of
Archytas on the required method for the duplication of the cube, and the
related later work of Archytas' avowed admirer Eratosthenes; it is typified
as the reflection of that true science of Sphaerics still to the present
day. The flaw of Hilbert respecting his Sixth Problem, is, essentially, an
expression of the fallacy of Euclidean a-priorism, an a-priorism which is
typical of what I have emphasized here as being a Delphic expression of a
"Type 'A' " mentality.
Second: is that that element of a-priorism in Hilbert's presentation of his
Sixth Problem, leads, "hereditarily," to a crucial second, systemic blunder
against both science and mankind, the perpetuation that same error in the
practice of science, still today: the fraud known as "the Second Law of
Thermodynamics."
Those who crafted that hoax known as "the Second
Law of thermodynamics," derived their fraudulent argument, ultimately,
entirely from the concept which Aeschylus attributed to the earlier decree
of his play's character of the Olympian Zeus, a concept for which Philo of
Alexandria, the associate of the Christian Apostle Peter, had denounced
Aristotelean influences on certain Jewish rabbis who had been corrupted by
Aristotelean paganism: zero scientific growth.51
The crucial false presumption, which entered the field of science through
the corrupting influence of Aristotle expressed in the form of Euclidean
geometry, was that implicitly embedded, a-priori error, in Hilbert's
statement of his Sixth Problem.
The problem which enmeshed Hilbert on that account, is a fallacious
presumption, by him, as by others, which I have stereotyped as the fallacy
of a-priori completeness. By presuming that the a-priori presumptions of
Euclid are "self-evidently" universal authorities of sense-perception in
their assigned role as premises for judgments, Hilbert confuses problems
which are more or less real ones, with others which are essentially products
of his own arbitrarily, errors of presumption. In other words, he, first,
incorporates the most essential of the presumptions of an a-priorism of the
type of Euclid, and of Aristotle before Euclid, as a premise of scientific
work in the field of mathematics. The case of the Sixth of his problems of
mathematical treatment of physics, is most clearly typical of the latter
case.
By that, I mean the arbitrarily a-prioristic presumption, that the
mathematics of physical science must be assumed to be a kind of filling-out
of what had been the fullness of what is the synthetic presumption of the
existence of an a-prioristically mathematical space defined by a merely
a-priori geometry such as that of Euclid. All this has transpired since the
beginning of the last century, all done as if Hilbert had not noticed the
wonderfully ironical, concluding sentence of Bernhard Riemann's 1854
habilitation dissertation: This leads us into the domain of another science,
the field of physics, which the character of today's proceedings
(mathematics) prohibit us from entering.52
So, Hilbert, like so many other leading representatives of his profession,
then and now, had fallen into the trap of "Type 'A' " thinking on this
account; but, there is more to the matter than merely that. The issue is,
essentially, the effects of today's presently persisting, evil presumption
attributed to the Olympian Zeus of Prometheus Bound:
that the "fire" of
action which defines physical space-time ontologically, must be denied to
exist, as the brainwashed dupes of Prince Philip's pro-genocidal World
Wildlife Fund, have agreed.
In reality, it is physical chemistry known, as
by Academician V.I. Vernadsky, through our experience of the way in which
creative practice of the human intellect defines both the continued
existence of mankind, and mankind's increased power as a species in that
role, which, as I shall show, soon, here defines space, rather than the
other way around.
This is, indeed, the underlying principle of any competent approach to the
subject of national economies: it is the dependency of mankind's continued
existence (i.e., "ecologically") on the development of those creative powers
of the human individual mind whose existence defines the absolute separation
of mankind from beasts. It is the Noösphere which defines the boundaries of
the existence of the Biosphere on Earth, and the Biosphere which, in turn,
bounds the relevant kinds of changes in the process of positive direction of
development of the Lithosphere.
Within the outlined area of the topic as just defined above, it is the role
of human individual creativity, as absent in all known lower forms of life,
which defines the positive options respecting the conditions of human
existence, and of the fate of the human species on Earth itself, as it will
be in man's habitation of other planets of our Solar system in some future
time. What is crucial in defining the preconditions and development of life
on Earth now, is the role of that human creativity which is not merely
ignored, but banned under the legendary Olympian Zeus, and by the
half-witted "Luddites" also known as the so-called "green ecologists" of the
world today.
This point is made clearer by the fact that we have now before us the
practicable challenge of using our ability to develop the kind of economy on
the Moon, which will enable us to meet the challenge of Man's colonization
of Mars, as a feasible goal for us to accomplish, beginning now, within the
span of the present centuryprovided we now reverse the present,
London-guided trend for a very early plunge into a prolonged, global new
dark age of all humanity.
With these prospects still before us, we have
reached the border where we must consider the matter of those preconditions
for flight from Earth-orbit to Mars-orbit within a lapsed time of days
through the relativistic space-time of nuclear-powered constant
acceleration-deceleration.
There are hosts of problems yet to be solved on
this account, but with foreseeable benefits which are within the future
range of specifically human creativity appropriately mobilized.
Once the human species is upgraded in practice in such ways, from man on
Earth, to man within the Solar system, the day-to-day meaning of
"physical-space-time" is changed in practice for mankind forever. This
quality of change does not change the nature of the universe, but simply
brings us that much closer to the experience of knowing mankind's role as
that already existing as an attainable objective within this universe,
within as little as five, or slightly more decades ahead.53
Against that background, the currently crucial issue in that case, when
considered within the context of Hilbert's argument, is that the mathematics
to which he makes reference does not permit the factor of actually
relativistic human creativity to be taken into account. Indeed, without
Albert Einstein's contributions to general relativity, we would lack the
degree of clear foresight into the physical principles which have enabled us
to foresee the challenge rather clearly.
In contrast to that, in respect to Hilbert's credulous view of the work of
the positivists Mach and Boltzmann,54 we have lived, is highly
ironical, that during the much of the just closed remainder of the Twentieth
Century, since the end of the 1920s, and also since the eve of the
realization of that great revolutionary work in the direction of Albert
Einstein's presentation of general relativity in physical space-time.
Since Einstein's rise to prominence in modern
science, with the rise of atomic, nuclear, and thermonuclear technologies of
very high energy-flux density now more or less in hand, and the prospect for
matter-antimatter methods on the more or less distant horizon, it is silly
to permit ourselves to be misled into to muddling one's way through the
relics of ancient and medieval notions of a-priori space, time, and matter,
a muddling which was already an absurd enterprise by about the time a
youthful Carl F. Gauss had "mysteriously" defined the orbit of Ceres.
That was a key point of reference in science, a
time when a Gauss who had solved the physical science mystery of the
asteroid Ceres, has been treated, still today, as being merely a
mathematician.
Hilbert - In
Conclusion
The symptoms of all of the actualized and implied failures in the argument
of Hilbert and others of the just recently past century, are to be traced,
systemically, as hereditarily, to the Aristotlean a-priorism of a Euclidean
geometry which had fallen into the utter degeneracy typified by the most
evil man of that century, avowed British (aka "brutish") imperialist
Bertrand Russell.
The first thing to be said in accounting for Hilbert's failure in the matter
just referenced, is that, clearly, Hilbert had never assimilated the
systemic implications of the principal discoveries by Bernhard Riemann,
notably the matters of the "bookends" of the opening two paragraphs and
closing sentence of Riemann's habilitation dissertation. Obviously, Hilbert
never wished to assimilate those notions of general relativity which were
already expressed, implicitly, in the opening and closing of that Riemann
dissertation. Even more obvious, is the evidence that much of what he did
understand in some matters, is to be identified, clinically, as exposing the
roots of his stubbornly a-prioristic refusal to attempt to understand, in
other instances, is my criticism of him here.55
Had one "harbored doubts" respecting what I have just said about Hilbert's
failing on that account, the conclusive evidence is, that that systemic
failure on his part, is consistent with Hilbert's softness on the systematic
fallacies of certain positivists, such as the cited cases of Mach and
Boltzmann; similarly, he shows no insight, in that 1900 location, into the
actual subject of general relativity, despite his association with Hermann
Minkowski during that time, that simply because he has not freed himself
from the systemic Aristotelianism of Euclidean geometry.56
He is obviously clever, competent, and also
frequently very stimulating in other ways, but only within the bounds of
certain mathematician's "book-ends". The important thing about him, is, that
foibles and all, he can not be seriously ignored by those among us who enjoy
being forced to think.57
I must add a certain autobiographical qualification to that, at this point,
qualifications of great importance for understanding the concept of a
science of physical economy..
Such are the elements of that specific power of insight which was provoked
within me by my disbelief in many of the standard opinions, including what
were taught to me as scientific verities at various times, and in sundry
settings. These considerations forced my attention to the matter of the
implicitly axiomatic roots of the differences between the way in which I
thought, unlike others, on many subjects, including my attention to the
frequent, systemic, populist implications of "comfortable old shoes" impact
of popular modes of thinking on the person with scientific training, as
their susceptibility to drift into Euclidean modes illustrates this
tendency.
My youthful contempt for Euclidean a-priorism gave me certain advantages on
this account. This gave me a significant margin of advantage in several
fields of specialties, especially what has been repeatedly demonstrated,
heretofore, as my own, relatively unique competence in economic forecasting.
I reference my own achievements in the respect that they are the fruit of a
distinctly principled advantage over the failed, reductionistic methods of
those drowning in the swamp of statistical abracadabra.
My presently stunning successes, globally, on
this account, have to be credited to the way in which my attention tended to
be focused on dynamics, even before I had full consciousness of even the
name of dynamics, rather than immediately stated, implicitly Cartesian,
ontological formalities of a given situation. All of my relatively unique,
important successes in economic forecasting over approximately five decades,
have been, principally, the fruit of such dynamic considerations.
The point to be emphasized is, that the key to actually understanding what
people think, lies in the domain of dynamics, where the view of a subject
has been shifted from the mechanical (e.g., "logical"/"deductive") aspect of
thought, to the power of the imagination used to identify the dynamic
principle which subsumes any competent form of so-called "way of thinking"
about a subject-matter.
The identification of "the way of thinking"
itself, must be the primary subject for consideration, as my emphasis on the
subject of "Type 'B' " illustrates this point. As in the case of Hilbert's
Sixth Problem, it is not Hilbert's argument, but Hilbert's way of thinking,
when viewed, itself, as an object, which is the standpoint to be adopted by
any competent observer/critic. How does Hilbert think; what is the species
of his kind of thinking? What are the dynamics of his method of thinking?
What universe do his judgments inhabitdynamically?
The rule for successful long-range economic forecasting is, as I shall
emphasizes in the most crucial, concluding chapter of this report, that the
future already exists, but is changeable. Take the relatively simplest kind
of illustration of what that means.
Aeschylus' presentation of the figure of Prometheus as the hero of mankind,
against mankind's cruel oppressor, the evil Olympian Zeus, points directly,
to anyone broadly familiar with the modern impact of what is termed
"Classical Greek scientific culture," to an opposing force in the known
history of human practice, at that time: that man is capable of creating
discoveries, and employing them, by means of which man's power to create, as
Genesis 1 implies this assignment to man and woman, as distinct from the
beasts.
That Zeus is a Satanic figure, who seeks to defy
the Creator by preventing the execution of the mission which the Creator, in
Genesis 1, has assigned to mankind, Zeus degrades the minds and morals of
people by means of denying that assigned obligation. The essence of the best
in Classical Greek culture, is, in fact the alliance with the Creator and
His principle, against the evil Delphic twins, Apollo and Dionysus. Indeed,
experience with contemporary history's effects of practice emphasize the
lesson to be learned on this account.
Thus, the a-priori presumptions of Euclidean geometry express exactly such a
Delphic intention. A Delphic intention known as the policy of those, such as
the Aristotle who is the credibly presumed inspiration of Euclid, who adhere
to the attempted alliance of King Philip of Macedon and the Persian Empire,
a common empirium of two parts, land-based and maritime, premised upon what
the Aristotelean has adopted as the same so-called "oligarchical principle"
which has been the intention of a trans-national system of imperial,
oligarchical rule in Aristotle's time, as later. This was the doctrine of
practice of the Roman Empire, of Byzantium, and of all medieval and modern
oligarchical political-economic systems.
That doctrine was never an expression of nature, which is defined by a
general principle of continuing, upward creation in all domains of
existence: the Lithosphere (and what it typifies), the Biosphere, and the
Noösphere. Only among the people of stupefied cultures, those who are
victims of their own, habituated, slave-like mentalities, the mentality of
the willing slave, who, in stark contrast to the heroic Frederick Douglass,
the slave who preferred to await comforting descent of manna from the hand
of the benevolent slave-master, is a policy of "zero growth" actually
believed. The a-priori aspects of Euclid's Elements is nothing other than an
example of this.
The principled quality of the systemic error in Hilbert's definition of his
Sixth Problem, is an expression of that oligarchical principle inherent in
the a-priori presumptions of Euclid's Elements.
This error by Hilbert, as by others, presumes a
universe based upon an a-prioristically fixed system, whose presumably
"fixed" nature presumes that the system's fullest elaboration is bounded, as
if externally, as if in infinite perpetuity, by the underlying presumptions
which have been expressed under the cloak of those a-prioristic
presumptions. Such is the error which has ensured the eternal defeat of
Hilbert's efforts to master the Sixth Problem.
That is the same error employed by Clausius, Grassmann, and Kelvin, for
their fraudulent concoction now expressed by the puling whine known as "the
second law of thermodynamics."
The fatuous presumption that a "second law of thermodynamics" were serious
scientific business, has arisen from the practice of a alleged "mathematical
science" spread within a large part of Eighteenth-century mathematics,
exactly as I identified the related problem here, earlier in this present
report, The blunder of attempting to define scientific principle from the
vantage-point of a Type "A" personality, by presuming that degree of
"sense-certainty," and thus excluding Type "B" realities, presumes that
physical principles lie within the domain of mere phenomena, in what are the
mere sense-perceptual shadows of reality, rather than in the principles of
action which are knowable only from the standpoint of reference of a Type
"B" mentality.
So, the duped adherents of the notion of a "second law," are only expressing
their relevant ignorance of actual physical principles as principles. They
see the phenomena associated with the effect of the principles, but see only
the shadows, thus, of the actual principles themselves.
This slave's-like blindness to reality of the
universe, has been the basis in assumptions for the acceptance of the a-prioristic
presumptions of Euclidean geometry, which suffers that intellectually fatal
error simply because the definition of an a-priori geometry, as opposed to
an experimental form of physical geometry, allows the dull-witted to
believe, religiously, in a "second law."
Thus, respecting the Sixth Problem, Hilbert's quest was ill-fated, and
hopeless, on this account, from the start.
V. MY SCIENCE OF PHYSICAL ECONOMY
...henceforth, space by itself, and time
by itself have vanished into the merest shadows, and only a kind of
blend of the two exists in its own right.
Herman Minkowski, 1907.
At this point, many readers will profess
themselves to be perplexed about the way in which my treatment of the
subject of economy differs so greatly from what they have both taught and
otherwise accustomed to regard as the subject-matter of economy.
Especially if they are professional specialists
in what is usually taught and debated as within the bounds of the standard
subject of "economics," what I have written here thus far, seems very
distant from the typical questions and supposed answers exchanged during
discussion identified as "economics." That apparent problem is essentially a
reflection of that fact, that what is defined as the scope and content of
discussions of economic policy has very little do with those aspects of
human nature which are actually relevant to the ways in which the well-being
and progress of the human condition may be actually fostered scientifically.
The academic and related sorts of discussion of what is regarded usually as
"economics," really has nothing much to with either human nature, as
distinct from that of both the beasts and the slaves who constitute the
generality of humanity under a Phyioscratic scheme, for example.
A competent
science of economics treats the subject of anti-development of human
culture, and proceeds so with the intent of enabling mankind not only to
rise above the population potentials and conditions of life among the higher
apes, but to master the improvement of mankind's power to increase our
species' dominant role over the planet's living population, to the extent
that we enjoy a population nearing seven billions living persons on this
planet today.
The latter gain is an expression of the progress of evolution of culture. It
is the progress of culture, as expressed in mankind's willful increase of
its potential relative population-density, life-expectancy, and power over
the planet, which is the only possible source of these advances in both the
human condition and in those alterations of the physical potential of the
planet on which that improvement for humanity depends. The definition and
mission of "economics" is the political improvements on which the
maintenance and advances of the human condition depend.
The facts which I have just summarized in that way, have assumed a
qualitatively deeper implication since civilization began to take seriously
the possibility of the extension of the human habitat into areas of our
Solar System beyond the bounds of our Earth's atmosphere.
Although many questions remain to be solved respecting the requirements of
extending human habitation into the Earth's Moon and beyond, as to Mars, but
the general notion of the feasibility of such developments has become much
clearer during a period of somewhat less than a century. Since travel of
mankind between the Earth's Moon and Mars orbit, requires forms of a
synthetic gravitational and electromagnetic condition of life within the set
of companion vehicles required for the human passengers and crews, we have
enjoyed some recent gains in our practical knowledge bearing on the problems
posed.
The estimates of the supplies of the Helium-3
isotope on our neighboring Moon, has implied a solution to the sustaining of
an induced one-gravity acceleration-deceleration for the several days
estimated lapsed-time of flight between the two planetary orbits.
The additional consideration to be addressed, is that on Mars itself, there
are notable needed buffers required to sustain the needed conditions of
human life in space-travel and on the Moon and Mars, for example.
In other
words, we must look to a future time when such things have been
accomplished; we must, even now, look backward, across time, to assess both,
not only how we might have already accomplished such developments of our
future, and what the related implications for a change in human culture,
from our presently Earth-bound conditions, to the notion of a human species
engaged in expanding its populations and their functions, not only within
the relatively nearer portions of the Solar system, but, ultimately,
throughout our own galaxy and beyond.
The significance of that set of those and related types of questions, for
the purposes of our discussion here, is that, in net effect, they force us
to finally reach an intelligent assessment of the true meaning of the term
called "economics."
We are thus forced to define the proper meaning
of the term "economics" as the urgently needed preconditions for continued
human survival, through scientific, technological, and related cultural
transformations, between now and the, admittedly very distant time, when our
Sun undergoes changes which would be most unpleasant for those persons who
might continue in residence on our planet then.
The related, special problem which perplexes what have been our relatively
best economists thus far, has been that the practice of management of
national economies, and the analysis of the effects of that practice by
certified economists, accountants, and so on, are regarded as authoritative,
despite the strong tendency of results and policy to converge in such a
fashion that economists and accountants are so often surprised that neither
their beliefs nor the statistics give fair warning of systemic failures
inherent in their professional practice.
The economy appears to be as successful as their
doctrines instruct them to believe, until reality ambushes them in a way
which they regard as simply "unfair" to their theories.
So, I continue here according to my methods, which work, rather than those
which habitually fail, but which have been, unfortunately, generally
accepted as conventional academic or other taught opinion and practice.
The first step in the direction of the much needed reform to which I have
just pointed, thus, has been supplied, recently, as a profound clarification
in meanings provided by the work of Academician V.I. Vernadsky in defining
the qualitative physical distinction and interrelations among the
Lithosphere, Biosphere, and Noösphere. It is the view of mankind's past,
present, and future history, within the bounds of those terms of reference,
which are the minimal requirement for defining a practiced science of
physical economy for the present and immediate future.
This clarification being delivered by me here, comes none too late. The
present world system, together with its featured present dogmas respecting
economy, have now become utterly bankrupt notions, which could be continued
in practice only by consenting to the virtual extinction of civilization as
we have so far known at its least worst. It is thus, in the domain of
culture, as I have emphasized the notion of a Type "B" personality here,
that the essential secret of continued human civilized existence and
progress now depend absolutely. Henceforth, economic science is the science
of those transformations in individual and mass human culture on which the
continued existence of civilized mankind depends.
The physical science of economics, as economics was formerly defined, now
becomes merely a subsumed, if still essential consideration, with the
appearance of the relevant view of the necessity of human culture progress,
as from the weaker and morally inferior ancient and medieval European
cultures, to the best expectations proffered by Nicholas of Cusa and his
followers in bringing forth the essential seeds of what continue to be the
good parts of modern civilization.
So, it was in the Boston Public Library, in 1941, when I first read those
opening lines of Minkowski's famous 1907 lecture. I spent many hours in that
reading room of the Library during those times; my principal interest there,
then, was the subject of physical relativity.58 At that moment,
reading those lines of his declaration, I was inspired by the resonance of
Minkowskis rhetoric then, but less so over the course of the following
dozen years, when the systemic, reductionist flaws of the positivist David
Hilbert's colleague Minkowski became clear to me.
The fact remained, that Minkowski, apparently,
did teach Albert Einstein in Zürich, Switzerland, but, apparently, never
came, actually, to understand the essential, Riemannian distinction of
Einstein's scientific method, himself.
Little wonder, then, that Minkowski's
"four-dimensional scheme" was a kind of failure typical of the positivist's
variety of "Type 'A' " mental outlook.
Now, amid the presently onrushing, global breakdown-crisis of the entire
world economy, the issue of "time as such" comes before you in a new guise,
in its role as physical time, as it must occur in any competent practice of
the science of physical economy which is our subject in this chapter of this
report.
That is the science of physical economy which
must now be adopted as the standard of practice used to replace what is
already, since September 2007, the hopelessly failed versions of what are
taught as "economics" seemingly everywhere among professionals and
politicians today.
-
For example: Let us begin the
presentation of the subject of this chapter by considering the
physical form of economic capital in its primary character as
technology, as technology is defined, rather than as a nominal value
of money, in terms of qualitative degrees upward in both
productivity and in the requirement of the effective equivalent of
orders of increase of energy-flux density.
Consider the consumption of an
investment in physical capital, from the time of its "birth" as a
type of physical-functional factor in economy, rather than matters
of price, considering the time until that capital investment might
be considered as "used up," as by age, wear, or technological
obsolescence, in its presently invested incarnation as an actual
feature of the process of production of physical wealth. Consider
the value of that capital to be expressed as the relative rate of
increase of productivity, per capita and per square kilometer, with
which the rate of related consumption by that body, is correlated in
practice.
Locate this aspect of that capital,
similarly, in respect to the losses incurred, as through
technological attrition, as a result of failing to supersede
previously established technology by a new technology which
increases the associated, relative productive powers of labor, and,
also, provides the benefit to society of the consumption of the
related product.
-
Then, ask yourself: when, in
time, was the gain actually produced, and when, in time, for
example, was the loss which is realized as the effect of failing to
invest in that capital, as capital so defined? What does such a
question evoke concerning the use of the term "physical space-time"
in the field of a science of physical economy? When is what value
earned, and how?
What does that say about the follies of financial accounting, on
principle? What does that say about what is presently taught as
economics? What does presently taught, monetarist economics suggest
itself, mistakenly, to be?
How shall I address the matter of the
proper connotation of an economic process as being, functionally, an
efficient expression of physical space-time, that in the sense
implied by the celebrated argument by Albert Einstein?
Similarly, define a subsuming dynamic of the
process within which the entire repertoire of all of these measures of
relative time and place of action are situated under that dynamic.
Those problems, for science, are ones which ought to have been recognized by
serious economists, that even by approximately the time I was sitting during
some evenings in the reading room of the Boston Public Library in Copley
Square. Back during 1941, I had begun to think about matters of that sort,
and to seek out those who had done so among what I regarded as actual, or
possible "authorities" in such matters. It proved, often, to be a lonely
pursuit.
Today, lost time being lost time for our culture, so, we must try to make up
for that, even decades later, here and now, before it is too late for
present and foreseeable future generations combined. The matter of the
principles of a science of physical economy, is now become, suddenly, a most
urgent affair for crucial decisions to be made at each new passing point in
time, including crucial decisions which must be made by society, top down,
in not more than some weeks ahead, even, in the worst case, more and more,
some days.
The substitution for this approach, by one based
on deals, compromises, and what-not, connived at over several months to
come, would be clinical insanity in the measure of their effects. What must
be done, as I have prescribed, must be done, and done quickly, or, there is
no existing remedy for what has been the already ongoing, current onrush
into a planet-wide new dark age.
Therefore, before plunging into the issues of the crucial importance of the
notion of relative physical time, let us pause by focusing on the following
question:
"Exactly why is it so urgent that I must
insist on bringing up that matter, exactly, here and now?"
To proceed further along those lines, ask
oneself: what is the factor of change which tends to cause the effect of a
net increase in the productive powers of labor, as measured per capita and
per square kilometer, when that effect does actually occur?
The answer to that latter question, as should be
obvious from the line of argument I shall take here, from this point on, is
that the answer to these questions is to be found by considering a function
of the form associated with the integral effect of the infinitesimal of the
Leibniz calculus, but not that of the incompetents who sought to overturn
Leibniz's work by their employment of fraudulent means, adversaries such as
those which I have identified as the hoaxsters Cauchy, Clausius, Grassmann,
Kelvin, et al.
Thus, it is on the point of that urgent matter, that I must hang the need to
focus fully on what will be regarded by most, at least at first glance, as
those novel, but presently indispensable aspects of the quality of physical
science of economy which I am emphasizing here.
So, the following relevant response to that question is interpolated at this
juncture in this report as a whole. After that I shall return to the topics
of the immediately preceding introductory paragraphs of this present
chapter.
My Warning Against
Some "Middle Men"
So, resume this chapter with what has proven itself to have been a fatefully
historic webcast of July 27, 2007, when I prescribed a set of actions
pivoted on my Homeowners' and Bank Protection Act (HBPA) of that
year, a prescription which I presented then as an already urgently needed
stop-gap remedy, a temporary remedy which would have been both possible,
and, also, indispensable for arresting the then already ongoing, inevitable
plunge of the world economy into a presently deepening, chain-reaction
series of general breakdown-crises.
Then, in those weeks of 2007, it would have been possible to avoid the
monstrous calamity brought upon the U.S.A. and the world by the actions of
such relevant scamps as the corrupt influence of such as Felix Rohatyn, U.S.
Senator Chris Dodd and of the babbling pitch-man of that standard
Congressional clown-show put on, ritually, by Representative Barney Frank.
Had that HBPA reform of mine been adopted promptly, our republic would
probably have been on the way to recovery by nowbut, also, a candidate
other than Barack Obama would, almost certainly, have been elected..
The role of the world's leading international drug-pusher, the British agent
George Soros and his fascist minions, in bringing about Obama's nomination
and election, is also most notable in that context.
Since those weeks in 2007, over the subsequent two years of the swindles
against the United States government and citizens by the Presidencies of
George W. Bush, Jr., and what have now been proven to be even
worse-than-Bush policies of the furiously insane, Hitler-like health-care
policies of President Barack Obama, a state of chaos has been generated
throughout the planet's economy as whole.
We have been overtaken, now, by a state of our
national affairs in which there is no longer any possibility of even
temporary rescue of our own, or any other part of the world's economy, by
means of a mere reform-in-bankruptcy-reorganization, even an excellent one
of the type which I had put forward in my July 27, 2007 webcast.
Now, the time has come, when there is the most desperately immediate need
for a sweeping change of the world system from a monetary system, to the
immediate adoption and implementation of a credit system like that
prescribed in the U.S. Federal Constitution. This is not an option; it is,
presently, the minimal pre-condition for preventing an immediate, global,
chain-reaction process which is far worse than any previous known historical
experience of the planet as a whole.
At this moment, there is a most urgent need for
an immediate transformation of the U.S. economy, freeing it immediately from
that Federal Reserve swindle, that Federal Reserve act which was conceived
and installed according to that tradition of the Confederacy represented by
both President Theodore Roosevelt and Ku Klux Klan leader Woodrow Wilson,
had been pushed through by their joint effects.
This was then, and is still now, a Federal
Reserve swindle in the British-created Confederacys tradition of President
Andrew Jackson, of President Martin van Burens design of the land-bank
swindle, and the outright treason of President James Buchanan,59
all of which had been designed to defy the U.S. Federal Constitution, for
the purpose of destroying what is fairly identified as a "Hamiltonian"
constitutional form of a credit-system, that U.S. form of credit-system
which is the central, systemic feature of our Federal Constitution.
That Constitution was built on the cornerstone
of the establishment of the U.S. constitutional credit-system, "still on the
books" of our original Federal Constitution, which, as all witting actual
patriots know, bans monetary systems, constitutionally, from the sovereign
practice of the United States.60
The complementary side of the U.S. existential problem today, has been a
product of the condition in which the world at large has been usually
dominated by a virtual global empire, excepting during some historically
brief periods of outstanding exceptions, such as the Eighteenth-century
League of Armed Neutrality, and under Presidents Abraham Lincoln and
Franklin Roosevelt. The world has been dominated, so, during the present
period of grave world crisis, by that so-called British Empire established,
in fact, through the outcome of the so-called "Seven Years War," in the
February 1763 Treaty of Paris.
That British empire-in-fact remains, to the present moment this is written,
essentially a form of Europe-centered, global imperialism based on the kind
of monetarist systems which have been centered on the Mediterranean since
about the time of the Peloponnesian War, up to the present moment.
The various so-called empires which have reigned in Europe since the
aftermath of the Peloponnesian War, had been, most notably, expressions of
the process of emergence of the successive Roman and Byzantine empires,
which were then followed, first, since about 1100 years ago, by an
international, monetarism-based succession of imperial monetarist
arrangements centered on the Venice which continued as a present expression
of arrangements which had emerged from Venice's being a client of a then
tattered and torn Byzantium, to an independent center of monetary power.
This has been a Venice which, in fact, has been
the spiritual center of a satanically inclined international system of
privately owned monetary institutions, that, first, over the course of the
medieval period (since, approximately, the time of the Norman Conquest)
prior to the Fourteenth-Century "New Dark Age," and, second, in modern
Europe, since that Venetian take-over of England through the corruption of
the Venetian financier oligarchy's puppet and wife-butcher Henry VIII,61
a change which set the formerly cooperating kingdoms of France, Spain, and
England (among others) against one another's throats in recurring religious
warfare, a radical, Tony Blair-like change in chosen destiny, throughout the
remainder of the A.D. 1492-1648 interval, but also to the present
imperialist day.
Now, there are two outstanding, present causes for the fact that no one
could now be able to implement the kind of a "less strenuous" option than an
"American style" monetary reform which I had originally proposed to occur
about the beginning of September 2007, which would have been a feasible
short-to medium-term remedy at that time, and under those conditions.
Since then, a great opportunity which I offered
to the U.S. government then, has been wasted, and it is a truly terrible
waste which we have suffered increasingly, since the lead taken by the
prominent actions of Senator Christopher Dodd and U.S. Representative Barney
Frank, in launching the folly which has thrown the United States and most of
the world economic system into the global breakdown-crisis we are
experiencing today.
First, since the course of September 2007, the Anglo-American financier
cabal which has organized this presently monstrous world crisis, has loaded
the U.S. system as a whole with such a mass of trillions of
dollars-equivalent of worthless "bail-out" electronic "paper," to such an
effect, that no internal reform of the present world monetary system, as a
reformed monetary system, is now possible.
Only the drastic remedies, based on the
replacement of the monetary system by a credit system, which I propose now,
represent any reason for hope for mankind during a period from the immediate
weeks before us, to some future time of recovery, generations ahead. Under
presently over-stretched circumstances, every attempt since September 2007
to limit matters to a mere monetary reform, which would only make everything
terribly worse, has taken over U.S. leading policy.
This practice has
continued to prevail up to the present moment, a policy of practice which
has now, in fact, set off a rapid succession of presently on-going,
chain-reaction breakdown-crises of every national economy, of every
continent in the world system.
This is the situation, which we had encountered in the crisis of July-August
2007, which has now brought the world as a whole, step by step, to that
presently aggravated stage of vulnerability which has led us to the present
onset of an immediately threatened, global breakdown-crisis of the planet as
a whole. This must be seen in the fact, that we live today in what has
become now virtually four recent decades of a process which had been
established by the time of the U.S. Nixon administration's actions of
1971-1972, breaking up the last vestiges of the fixed-exchange-rate monetary
system.
The virtually treasonous developments by the U.S. Nixon Administration which
were set into motion then, lit the fuse on a bomb-like crisis which had
already been set into place by the British government of Prime Minister
Harold Wilson. It was that Wilson, a creature already on record as a
malicious character in his own right, seen so by patriotic Britons more or
less as much by them, as by our own patriots of that time, a Wilson who had
set off the first step into the mire of the present world monetary crisis,
on November 15, 1967.
That devaluation of the Pound Sterling, from $U.S2.80 to $2.40, triggered an
intended chain-reaction in the international monetary system, which, in
turn, triggered the U.S. dollar crisis of February 1968. A bit later, there
came a new wrecking of the economy, as added through the complicity of Felix
Rohatyn's regular crony, George Shultz, then of the U.S. Nixon
Administration.
This was a Shultz who would soon become
notorious for his relevant inclination to promote fascist schemes of
government in such places as Chile, and who supplied a key role in the
break-up of what had been the Truman-Churchill modified, pro-Keynes version
of the Bretton Woods monetary system, with which Winston Churchill had
encouraged President Truman to replace President Roosevelt's intended
international, post-World War II credit system in favor of Roosevelt's
Bretton Woods adversary. Keynes.
Thus, beginning approximately 1966, about a year before the relevant
international monetary actions by the British Harold Wilson government, the
U.S.A., in particular, had already led the post-John F. Kennedy Americas,
Europe, and Africa down the road toward economic ruin.
That change, then a later change, then another change, and so on, has been
introduced here, or there; but always, down the road which has led, step by
step, like the Russian soldiers of Sergei Eisensteins film Potemkin,
proceeding down the famous steps of Odessa.
From the assassination of a
President John F. Kennedy who had refused to walk into the London-prepared
strategic trap of a war against the U.S.A.s World War II ally Ho Chi Minh,
through a President Johnson who was so terrified of a similar treatment for
him, that he fearfully allowed the fraudulent Gulf of Tonkin myth to push
the U.S.A. into a long, ruinous Indo-China war, step by step, in a
policy-trend continuing from Johnson, to Nixon, to Ford, to Carter, to
Reagan, and into the new wave of ruin launched in 1989 by President George
H. W. Bushs depraved complicity with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and
Frances President Mitterrand, in creating the presently ruinous Euro
system of western and central Europe, and through the fraudulent,
strategically crucial impeachment effort, assisted by Vice-President Al
Gore, against President Bill Clinton, and through the Anglo-Saudi crafting
of what became known as 9-11, the direction of the economies of the
Americas have been marching, step by step, head of state, head of
government, down, down, down, and worse, worse, and worse, in seemingly
endless, rhythmic monotony, always marching to the thumps of an imperial
British official funeral processions drum, like the Potemkin films
soldiers down, down, down the steps at Odessa, still to be heard marching in
our imagination (if we are truly intelligent in such matters), at the
present moment.62
It would be incompetent to view that aspect of the November 1963-September
to August 2009 history of both the United States and the world at large, in
any different imagery than that which I have just described in these
preceding paragraphs. Since real economic processes are dynamic processes
subsuming their own internal, qualitative phase-shifts, only foolish
varieties of accountants and their dupes believe in statistical forms of
financial forecasting.
What happened, over that the span of that succession of marching events, did
not "just happen." It was organized, sometimes wittingly, organized by aid
of complicit U.S. Presidents, and other leaders of other nations, figures
who, in the main, had not the slightest damned inkling of the damned fool's
role they are continuing to act out, still today, since the death of
President Kennedy in November 1963, until the "Ides of September" 2009,
always, again, and again, and again, under pressure from social-political
forces of whose existence and nature most of them had had little or no
comprehension.
This pattern of a seemingly robotic compulsion
of the leading circles of our republic to behave like an "electric bunny" in
this way, explains the process of elimination which led to my becoming the
world's only competent long-range forecaster on record, from August 1956 to
the present day. The essential truth has been clear to me, if, in earlier
decades, sometimes only in broad-brush terms, all the way through, down each
step of that most recent historical process.
For my own success as an economist, which was continuing amid all this,
thank, more than anyone else, credit the great Bernhard Riemann (and
his 1854 habilitation dissertation), who had taught me far more than anyone
else since my encounter with Gottfried Leibniz, that which is, still today,
the key to defining the principles of a science of physical economy and its
related statecraft.
The Present World
Crisis
Within the passage down those steps of the imagination, the ensuing,
shamelessly overt process of wrecking the U.S. economy under British
direction, and the complicity of the successive U.S. Nixon, Ford, and Carter
administrations, produced what has been called "globalization," and, has,
thus, made a mockery of what had been known earlier by the name of "national
sovereignty."
Under the present conditions so generated through
London-directed "globalization," any collapse of the U.S. dollar now, means
an immediate, chain-reaction process of disintegration of the entirety of
the present world market.63
We should mean, by a shift to the worse than worthless, present world
monetary systems (and the planetary monetary system as a whole), that we
know that there has been, especially since July-September 2007, a socially
dominant, dynamic form of influence which has produced, what has been since,
the unavoidable rate of the reduction of the current, net fungible, actual
net financial assets of the world, that down to levels well below the level
of an actual (i.e., physical-economic) breaking-point.
As my "Triple Curve" illustrates the point, this
recent, calamitous rate of fall of net financial assets, has been
accompanied by an accelerated rate of increase of monetary emission: a sure
formula for a process with an eerie kinship to the hyper-inflationary
breakdown of the economy of Weimar Germany during the Spring through Autumn
of 1923.
The updated edition of my "Triple Curve" representation, shows the
crucial features of the change in trend which has characterized that
general, planet-wide economic breakdown-crisis which has been clearly
ongoing since the close of July 2007.
[[Graphic illustration]]
If the reform which I have specified as a change
from a monetary system, to a credit system, occurs, that short-fall I have
point to here, can then be covered, to ensure a process of recovery, by the
uttering of long-term credit, based entirely on the promises of sovereign
nation-state governments, as defined in a unique way by the intrinsically
"Hamiltonian" preconditions prescribed for the U.S. Federal Constitution.
Through those treaty agreements among sovereign
nation-states participating in such a general reform which had then produced
a new, fixed-exchange-rate world credit system, a credit system permits
sufficient fresh credit for physical investment in expansion and
science-driven, advanced-technology enhancement of the productive powers of
cooperating nations (as measured per capita and per square kilometer in each
case) to begin an steeply accelerating process of increase of the physical
productive powers of labor throughout most of the planet through development
of sources of public power which are of today's very high, and still rising
energy-flux-density in character.
The crucial feature of a change to a credit system, while, of necessity,
cancelling the earlier existence of inherently failed monetary systems, is
that the practice of going to the private financial market for investment in
development of the economy, puts the borrower, including leading governments
of the world, at the mercy of that great imperial bloodsucker known as a the
nominally private power expressed as a reigning "free trade" sort of
monetary system.
It has been the attempted "bail out" of that
vampire known as the monetary system, the which has sucked the blood of our
people since the first steps toward the relevant phases of the "bail-out"
which was begun by the often Felix Rohatyn-guided Senator Dodd and by
Representative Barney-the-great-sucking-vampire-of-Wall-Street-interest
Frank, beginning September 2007.
This recovery can only occur under the condition that no monetary system
still exists as a recognized institution throughout the participating
members of the community of nations generally. Hence, without a bloc of
nations, the United States, Russia, China, and India, leading a faction of
nations forcing the world to go through a sudden economic reorganization,
from a monetary to a credit system, there is no political prospect that the
world could escape what presently looms before us in the immediate period
ahead, as the most horrifying rate of sickeningly sudden collapse of the
population of our planet in all known history.
In such matters, only hateful fools waste
efforts in support of the futility of Liberal sophistries; in matters of
life of death, of persons, or nations, you must do promptly what history has
handed to you as what must be done.
Some valid, crucial, and encouraging considerations, which follow:
It should be noted, for our consideration at this point in the report, that
what should become the initial pricing of goods within economies and in
relationships among member-nations of the new, protectionist mode of
international, fixed-exchange-rate credit-system, that traditional
price-relations among treaty-defined members of a system of market
economies, shall be the general tendency in the early phases of the
international economic-recovery process, with the exception that prices
below actually incurred costs shall be discouraged, and that parities among
the currencies of nations shall be provided for the same intended effect.
The most essential difference, therefore, is the shift from continuing to be
the presumed lawful prey of a monetarist system, to becoming a competently
managed credit system.
A blending of what are to be preferred as, respectively public-and
privately-held enterprises, is to be expected under the new credit-systems,
both within and among participating nations, with the emphasis on public
investment in basic economic infrastructure, and sundry customary forms of
private entrepreneurship predominating in local, national, and international
marketing of agricultural and manufactured goods, and traditionally private
services.
A notable type of exception to this should echo the Hill-Burton law in the
U.S.A.,64 and comparable-effect methods in other nations.65
Simply and suddenly scrap the swindle known as the U.S. HMO law.
These measures of positive reform which I have
prescribed are based on principled concept of the credit system which is
built into the dynamic architecture of original crafting of our Federal
Constitution, historically, must be complemented by national authority and
responsibility for certain categories of public lands, protection and
development of waterways, public educational programs, and national public
transportation systems essential to the economy and general welfare of the
population as a whole.
As a matter of general principle, public enterprises are to be preferred
when either the promotion of the public interest demands this, either by the
nature of the operation, or for reason of the lack of a private capability
for providing a needed function of a type which would otherwise be preferred
as a private venture.
On the crucially principled matter of my strictly scientific use of dynamic
in the preceding paragraph, the following must be said at this time.
We return now to the matter of the principled nature of the fundamentally
new characteristics of the world economy, under the launching of the
urgently needed new world system of a fixed-exchange credit-system shared
among respectively sovereign nation-states.
For this purpose, before getting
into the matters of physical-economic principle as such, I illustrate the
function of dynamics in historical processes by aid of the following,
additional illustrations.
Henry C. Carey,
Lincoln, and Bismarck
U. S. President Andrew Johnson (1865-1869) turned out to have been the
virtual Harry Truman of his tenure (1945-1953).
To grasp the presently
relevant implications of that fact, we must situate that Johnson with
respect to those U.S. institutional figures who did actually represent the
heritage of President Abraham Lincoln, that through the conflicted times
leading into that assassination of President William McKinley which was
launched in the specific imperial interests of the British Empire.
Amid the scoundrels among the prominent
political figures of post-war 1860s and 1870s, there were also many true
patriots, such as Lincoln's close associate on economy policy, the Henry C.
Carey who contributed a crucial part in shaping the economic and related
policy-decisions of Germany's Chancellor Bismarck, during the late 1870s and
1880s, prior to the dumping of Bismarck himself, by the British Prince of
Wales' nephew, Wilhelm II, in 1890.
Nonetheless, in defiance of clear evidence (but, in favor of a rather "free
hand" variety of interpretation of isolated facts), a significant selection
of citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany go out of their way in what
is often a frankly anti-American effort to deny the crucial role of the
influence of the leading economist of the Nineteenth Century, Henry C.
Carey, in informing Chancellor Otto v. Bismarck personally of those
strategic principles of the American System of political economy, advice
which guided the seeming miraculously progress of Germany from the late
1870s, up through the dumping of Bismarck by the most foolish nephew of the
British Prince of Wales, in 1890.
Since that dumping of Bismarck which turned to
be among the most crucial factors leading into the ups and downs of all of
the major wars and near-wars of the Twentieth Century, my point respecting
Bismarcks affinities for the American System of political-economy, has
considerable importance for anyone who might imagine that he or she is
competent to lead, or even to advise, any great nation of the world, such as
our own U.S.A., today.
It were not possible for competent historians to
misinterpret Bismarcks actions in the way that is often done, unless one
were determined to ignore the most important facts about Bismarck's
strategic role, globally, and in respect to the leading importance of that
role in the entire sweep of the global strategic history of modern, post-Westphalian
Europe and the Americas, even to the present day.
The included point to be stressed on this account, is that Bismarck's record
as a statesman shows some significant signs of a "Type 'B' " personality, a
quality which he had acquired somehow along the line. For our purposes here,
I simply note that fact for the reader's own future reference, and to
situate the following further remarks on some crucial features of Bismarck's
role which must be taken into account for guiding European history into a
forward direction, still today.
The relevant strategically crucial fact, for our subject here, about
Bismarck's role in the history of modern, post-Westphalia European
civilization as a whole, to the present day, is that he is among a most
uncommon variety of exceptional individuals, a man of his own mind, even
when the relevant head of state and the general run of other national
leaders tended to be shallow-minded respecting the strategic issues of that
world in the large, a Germany for which modern Germany, then and now, has
been often a kicked ball in play on a global playing-field.
Bismarck was different than most leaders of his
time; he could think: which is why the Prince of Wales urged silly Wilhelm
II to dump him. Modern critics and small-minded commentators who do not
think seriously, will, of course, miss all the crucial points of what are,
without reasonable objection, the essential facts of the matter.
The key fact is that the dumping of Bismarck,
combined with the succession of the assassination of Frances President Sadi
Carnot; the Dreyfuss case; and, the successful assassination of U.S.
President William McKinley by an assassin imported from Europe, which was
used to bring Londons asset, Vice-President Theodore Roosevelt, into the
U.S. Presidency: were the most typical, crucial developments leading into
what became the unleashing of not only two World Wars, but, also, earlier,
the British-directed 1894-1945 war of Japan against China, Korea, and
Russia, and, also, sundry other little matters, such as the bombing of Pearl
Harbor, which are of some considerable, continued importance, still today.
Consider the playing-field of history into which Bismarck came to play his
strategic role.
Anyone who has any competence in history as a science, rather than products
of some virtual gossip-sheets such as the New York Times, knows that the
history of modern European civilization has been dominated from about the
time of the coronation of the Venetian asset, King James I, until the
present moment, in such a fashion that all the leading developments in the
world considered as a whole, have expressed the four-centuries-spanning
division between what are, presently, two traditionally English-speaking
nations of, primarily, European cultural origins, between what had emerged,
essentially, since the beginning of the Seventeenth-century, as the birth of
our United States out of the initiative of some English-speaking colonists,
including those others from continental Europe who joined them in that
enterprise, and, on the opposing side, what became known under the
simplistic and more than somewhat misleading title of "the British Empire."
When we take into account the relevant content of Rosa Luxemburg's The
Accumulation of Capital and also what U.S. State Department historian
Herbert Feis exposed, later, as showing the actual principle of British
imperialism in action, showing, thus, the true role of our republic's chief
adversary still today, we know that the British monarchy has been a
political receptacle for an international empire of concerted, private
monetarist interests, an empire which is still today, centered as a monetary
system, traditionally, in Venice.
We also know that the true world empire, still
today, is the present world monetarist system whose public political
headquarters of record of the moment happens to be London, but whose true,
Satanic soul prefers to reside in Venice.
That is to emphasize the extremely important political distinction to be
made, that it is not the imposition of the will of the people of England,
Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, which rules; the empire is ruled by
the agents of an international pack of Venetian-like, gangster-like, private
financier-monetarist interests, which represent a combined, global
monetarist power (including the virtual Gadarene swine of Wall Street) which
is the presently chief agent of the presently reigning, international
monetarist empire.
The Role of Britain in
This
There is absolutely no sophistry in emphasizing that distinction. The
political issue of relevance, is that the British Isles are operating under
a dynamic influence, as the concluding paragraph of Percy B. Shelleys
A Defence of Poetry emphasizes the crucial point of distinction to be noted.
The effect of the defeat and disgrace of the
present policy-structures commanding the British empire in its continuing,
present role, would have an effect not dissimilar from the benefit of the
current, widespread break of the majority of the U.S. citizens, currently,
from both the Obama administration and the U.S. members of the Congress
generally.
There is, currently, a mass-strike-like effect
within the United States, one comparable in some degree to the We are the
People, of the citizens of the DDR against the government of the East
Germany Land of Milk and Honey.
My point here is, that there are also aspects of
the use of the language and dialects of the United Kingdom, which run as
deep in the tradition of the language and its culture as the time of the
fall of Richard III at the hands of Henry V, or Das Volk of 1939, and the
rising up of our citizens against the President and the Congress which
disgusted them, this August 2009. Such is the power of the true "invisible
hand" in history, of dynamics.
Britons, as they are called, have carried the burden of a recent bestialized
experience, but people are not beasts, but human. People are not mortal in
spirit, as beasts are; the cultural currents in which they participate as a
kind of heritage, live on. What has been history, moves on, but absolutely
not as the evil George Soros would guide it.
There are potentials for corrections built into
the process of successive shifts in reigning dynamics of that process, just
as Shelley referred implicitly to a positive shift from the bestiality of
the time of Mandeville, to what we might hope would become a renaissance of
that spirit of England, Scotland, and Wales, which many among our own
ancestors shared, during the times of Keats, Shelley, and Robert Burns.
It is, once again, a matter of the principle of Leibnizian dynamics.
The power to rule by force, as in the hands of this "Brutish" empire, is
twofold. First, it is the force of the control over the planet by such as
those monetarist types of financier swine of the United Kingdom and Goldman
Sach's Wall Street. Second, it is playing the nations and peoples which are
its intended victims, against one another, as the British Empire itself was
first established as a private Company by means of the Seven Years War, a
war during which the nations of continental Europe were so passionately
occupied in mutual blood-letting among themselves, all for the sake of the
greater and more enduring tyranny of Britain, that they fell prey to London
in February 1763.
Put aside that computer for the moment.
History is not made by counting numbers.
History, as the great English poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley knew, is, on the
one hand, determined by certain specific, dynamic qualities of culture which
dominates the public human mind, and all but a minority otherwise.
Otherwise, as Shelley emphasized in what I have pointed out for this purpose
as his A Defence of Poetry, the dynamic of real history is located, not in
persons considered one at a time, but, rather, in the principle of dynamics,
as this notion was developed in the leading work done then by Gottfried
Leibniz, during the decade of the 1690s.
Thus, often in real history, a certain quality
of an idea in the minds of a few associated people, such as the case of Wall
Street, has been, for a time, the relatively more powerful force in the
shaping of all positive developments in known human history. Sometimes,
fortunately, as under President Abraham Lincoln or Franklin Roosevelt, a
shift to a different expression of that power expresses the dynamic of the
handful of the new leadership which leads the world itself in that time and
place.
That is so in the foresights of the greatest Classical authors, composers,
scientists, and true discoverers of principles generally.
The process of the development of ideas with
which their efforts have been associated, represent a force of dynamics as
the best of the ancient Classical Greeks knew this conception, and as
Leibniz made it the central principle of all competent modern physical
science.
It is conflicting forces of dynamics, rather
than individual opinions defined statistically, no matter in what numbers,
which is the actual shaping of what may come to be considered in retrospect,
as the creative force in the shaping of forward movements in the human
condition.
The Example of
Bismarck In This
Amid such considerations met in history at large, there are, sometimes,
exceptional individuals who have the opportunity to play a role of great
benefit to their nation, or to society more broadly, as we should recognize
in certain crucial features of Bismarck's role as Chancellor under Germany's
Wilhelm I. On this specific point, Bismarck, speaking in a time, after silly
Wilhelm II had dumped him in 1890, spoke the true words warning of the
British empire's role in creating what was to become known as World War I: a
new "Seven Years War."
Bismarck's reforms, launched under American influence during the late 1870s,
like parallel reforms in Japan during that same period, were also an
expression of the principle underlying Bismarck's use of the words: "Seven
Years War" during the post-1890 years.66
Since the onset of the rise of the Netherlands as the Anglo-Dutch paw in the
wars against Louis XIV's France, and the Anglo-Dutch orchestration of what
became known as the "Seven Years War," the policy of the imperial
Anglo-Dutch cabal of today's pro-bestial, World Wildlife Fund, which had
been represented recently by Britain's Prince Philip and Netherlands
ex-Nazi-SS man Prince Bernhard, has been twofold.
-
First, always, to set the nations of
continental Europe against one another's throats, and to act
similarly in Near Asia, as in the Sykes-Picot treaty organization
which runs the Middle East wars, including those in Afghanistan and
within the region of Pakistan today.
-
Second, to destroy the United States,
preferably by the combined use of moral and financial corruption-,
with useless wars, such as those in Iraq under George H.W. Bush and
his son George W. Bush, Jr., and in Afghanistan, then, as now, or
Indo-China earlier, as instruments for destroying the U.S.A. itself,
as we are experiencing such a treasonous design steering the present
role of a British puppet-President of the U.S.A., Barack Obama.67
Bismarck knew that the world was dominated,
principally, by a great existential struggle between the U.S. constitutional
republic and the British Empire.
Since the Seven Years War and the relative ruin
of France through the London-orchestrated "freemasonic wars" of the
Eighteenth and early Nineteenth centuries, all other nations of the world,
including Russia, for example, are torn between the polarities of interest
respecting the great strategic struggle between the U.S. constitutional
system and the British Empire.
That is the situation at the moment, when
various national capitals in Asia are undergoing shifting pressures to lean
toward, or against the U.S.A., and, thus, for, or against the British
empire, in what every leading capital of today's world knows as taking
either London's or Washington's side in the great new mortal holocaust which
is in the process of breaking out soon among the forces of the planet as a
whole.
Bismarck understood this nature of things strategically. He knew, for
example, as President Charles de Gaulle later expressed that understanding
in his pact with Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, and in a related policy of
(continental) Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals, Bismarck had already
understood that were Prussia/Germany not to seek a fraternal quality of
peace with France, once the British puppet, the casus belli 's Napoleon III,
were dumped, that the British would use the hatred of Germany stirred up, by
a continuation of the warfare in France, to tend to bring a France driven
foolish with rage such as that expressed by foolish Karl Marx's idol, the
Paris Commune, into line with London in a coming two-front war against
Germany.
Other German leaders were not quite that smart at the time, or, for the most
part, later. Bismarck had also made a secret agreement with the Russian
Czar, against the policy of his own Kaiser, silly Wilhelm II, to agree with
the Czar, that Germany would not support the Habsburgs in a new Balkan war,
one of the key reasons that the Prince of Wales demanded that his nephew
Wilhelm II dump Chancellor Bismarck, a dumping of Bismarck which ensured
what was to become "World War I, " and, also, the echo known as "World War
II," and also the "Cold War," and the U.S. War in Indo-China after that..
Who in Hell is so stupid today that he does not know that the British empire
under the present family monarchy, has had a centuries-long, unique criminal
responsibility for the processes leading into the two World Wars of the
Twentieth Century, and most of the worst horrors, include things ranging
from such as original authorship of the mass-murder campaign adopted by
Hitler during 1939-1945, through U.S. President Barack Obama copy of the
style of Nazi health-care operations of 1939-1945?
Or, also, specifically, that the source of he
Nazi-copied health-care policy of President Obama as an echo of the same
Nazi-like policies of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and Blair's
shaping of he the NICE-NHS operations, then, as in Britain and in the Obama
administration now, and by the Hitler regime in Germany from September 1939
on?
The great statesman of the world avoids taking sides passionately in
quarrels among lesser powers. He, or she saves his fire for dealing with the
great imperial forces of the principal enemy, or, he or she acts on behalf
of civilization in crafting the strategic approach adopted for dealing with
any perceived threat from a particular local party. Sykes-Picot cockpits
such as those which London manages, top-down, prompting of terrorism and
permanent wars and permanent revolutions, such as those of British agent
Helphand-Parvus earlier, including those throughout Southwest Asia,
including Iran, are British-made versions of the likeness of Malaysian
monkey-traps used to snare and kill human beings sickened with silly
homicidal passions en masse.
Britains policy remains New Seven Years Wars
for every climate and season, in every part of the world today: it was
sometimes called the imperial practice of divide and rule. The suckers,
like Obama Presidencys folly in Afghanistan today, are the suckers who
still buy into the tradition of what had been a Malaysian farmer's simple
monkey-trap, as a lure for people today, as in the case of that poor monkey,
the Obama administration itself!
Let us say, that the next Nuremberg Trial should be convened in London, for
the convenience of the suspects at trial, who might be residing a mere
subway ride distant from the place where the relevant proceedings are to be
held.
The Role of Drama in
Scientific Creativity
"All the world's a stage." In the world of "Type 'B' " personalities, a
world in which the human mind manages an intermediating relationship with
the domain of mere sense-perception, that human mind tends to create a
surrogate identity for himself, or herself, an identity which is an
object-like personality which is employed to mediate the relationship
between the self-conscious, creative powers of the [Type 'B'] individual
mind, and the domain of sense-perception.
It is this role of the surrogate, between the
inner self-conscious of the person and the sense-perceptual domain, which
inspires the character of both the scientist and the self-critical,
Classical artist. This is the [Type 'B'] relationship between the inner self
and the surrogate. which appears to be the "external identity" of the
actually creative mind, which underlies the notion of "all the world's a
stage."
So, in the greatest Classical dramas, for example, the audience,
contemplating the proceedings on stage, is experiencing that three-fold
relationship of Type "B," mind to the sense-perceived object, a relationship
which we should associate both with Classical physical science and with
great Classical artistic composition and its performance. In both domains,
we view the actors on stage, or on the television screen, as merely the
indispensable instruments of the mind of the playwright and director,
objects which have a function, but no substance in themselves, otherwise;
the actors on stage are required, because they are required to mediate the
audience's attempts to grasp the reality of the idea of that social process
which subsumes the role of the actors dynamically.
A congruence must be achieved, to the intended
effect, that when the closing curtain has rung down, and the players and
director appear on stage, they come as if they were strangers from a world
outside what had transpired behind that now lowered curtain. (If not, either
the play, or the players, were a failure.)
So, as I have stressed repeatedly during this report, thus basing myself on
past decades of experience, that true human creativity, including
physical-scientific creativity, resides, originally, only in Classical
artistic composition, and from thence, when, from time to time, the quality
of creativity is, so to speak, at home, it enjoys visits with its
well-meaning, but dull-witted, harem-eunnuch-like neighbor, mathematical
physical science, bringing the neighboring Mr. Mathematics not sugar, nor a
neighborly sharing of cups of coffee or tea, but a bit of the actual
creativity which mathematicians as such have never been able to supply from
within its own native calculations.
The case of the creatively imaginative Albert
Einstein and his violin, points out the relevant distinctions, and related
matters of connections.
Here, Einstein, as the seriously committed, if amateur Classical musician,
finds his own reflection, in the domain of the creative imagination, in
Einstein's own domain of scientific genius. All good science, including any
competent practice of a science of physical economy, is situated in a
Classical artistic sense of personal identity.
With the performer's active sense of the
dialogue between these two "phase spaces" as the actual substance of the
performance, both the artist and the scientist produce those intended
effects of performances which were to be readily recognized as such on any
relevant occasion. So, on the contrary, the maliciously intended perversion
of such post-1945, existentialist forms of moral and intellectual corruption
as the propaganada piece known as The Authoritarian Personality and the
European Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), contributed their leading part
to the destruction of the economy of both Europe and the Americas.
The destruction of the moral sense, which is
characteristic of the existentialist notion of what is sometimes named "thrownness,"
by destroying the moral character of the personality, destroys the creative
factor on which the effective inspiration of science depends. Hence, in the
latter, pathological case, we have witnessed such expressions of
"existentialism" as the fascism of either the Nazi regime or its twin
brother, the '68ers' so-called "New Left."
The musician, or scientist who is not self-conscious of this in his own
role, tends, thus, to become a moral failure of performance, in either, and
both instances. Each may attempt to simulate an honest performance, more or
less cleverly, but, mere cleverness is neither artistic nor scientific
inspiration.
Similarly, for related reasons, whenever the actor on stage locates the
mission in his own person, rather than the "Type 'B' " personality crafted
by the playwright, director, and the real-life personality of the sound
actor off-stage, the hollow sound reveals itself to the soul of the
audience, and, probably, to the soul himself, or herself, in one fashion or
the other. Mere technique fails, when the performer has mislain his soul for
that occasion when the personal "ego" charges out on stage, as in the case
of Olivier's disgusting playing in Richard III.68
So, as I have emphasized within earlier chapters of this present report, the
root of human creativity is resident within the powers of the "Type 'B' "
development of the individual human mind, not the presently more popular,
and more object-like image of self expressed by "Type 'A'." Take the case of
music or drama as illustrations of the state of mind typical of the truly
creative artist. My associates and I have often discussed this among us, on
those occasions when we refer to matters of Classical modes in drama and
music.
However, never forget that such examples are
also of crucial importance for science, especially so in the matter of that
science of physical economy which is our principal subject-matter here.
I shall summarize two, rather obviously related examples of types from
Classical music and drama, first, and then show the relevance of such
illustrations for showing related characteristics of competent thinking
about a science of physical economy.
The well-trained musical buffoon, or what had once been Classically trained
musician turned apostate from Bach, as cases of such types are illustrated
by those terribly offensive, sometimes disgusting, systemic faults of the
late stage-actor Sir Lawrence Olivier, substitutes some fantasy about
himself, or herself, for the part he, or she plays. The great actor, or
poet, harks back to the Classical stage of ancient Greek times, with parts
performed behind the mask.
What lurks behind the mask, from case to case,
within the confines of each drama, is a completely different personality,
whose characteristic behavior differs accordingly from another person who
takes a turn in speaking, on behalf of a different character, behind the
very same mask.
All great Classical poets and singers have understood this matter more or
less well, and good Classical playwrights and composers, too.
The truly dedicated and skilled actor, who, therefore, develops, and plays
his part behind the mask, in his turn, knows virtually every hidden detail
of the mind of the character he plays, even those aspects of the character's
life which are not included in the script. In his, or her preparations to go
on stage, since the ancient Iliad, Odyssey, and the dramas of Aeschylus,
that actor never limits himself, or herself to consideration of the specific
actions assigned to that part within the relevant play.
That truly qualified actor would recognize the
personality of the same character he is assigned to play, in an entirely
different drama, as occurs with some Shakespeare dramas, because this actor
has developed insight into the dynamics of the existential character of the
character, a character, such as Sir John Falstaff, whose "voice" is
recognizable from behind whatever mask he bears on stage.
The same is true for the competently composed and acted Classical musical
drama, or any competently composed and performed work. The counterpoint
marches, but the concept lies in the mind of the composer, performers, and
audience, respectively, not in the abstract expression of the procession of
notes as such.
The competent actor, for example, does not put himself, or herself into the
part, but. like a competent psychoanalyst, plays the part under
consideration as he were a marionettist, as something outside himself which
he or she has treated, or even created, and which he, or she controls, by
himself, but as outside himself.
This is just as the competent scientist, of the Type "B" category, judges
the phenomena, including that which he, or she is generating, and is
playing, as the marionettist does. It is the same with the competent
scientist, who orchestrates the effects, the virtual shadows on the wall of
sense-perception, which he, or she produces. He, or she accomplishes that
effect by knowing the real subject, which is unseen, but whose shadow is
cast in the form of either sensory or imaginary perceptions. The perceived
figure on stage, is projected upon that perceived stage as the unseen person
played by the actor who has thus created, and is controlling that image,
that shadow of his imagination, which the audience imagines that it had
perceived on stage.
It is the same in competent physical science enacted within the real domain
of the conceptions of the Type "B" mind..
That much said of the Classical actor, now translate what I have just
described about such Classical characters and of the way a character to be
played by such as Mr. or Mrs. "Type 'B' " is situated within that great
drama which is the proper, ironical practice of physical science and its
part in the definition of physical economics as the chief part of physical
science. Use an ironical aspect of Kepler's uniquely original discovery of
the concept of universal gravitation, as the place at which to moor the
relevant argument, as follows:
As I have already emphasized, earlier, here, there are actually two
conceptions of the principle of universal gravitation represented by
Kepler's discovery.
The lesser discovery, which is actually a
by-product of the greater, is the determination of a mathematical expression
for the role of gravitation within the Solar System, an otherwise perfect
such formulation, which lacked only a precise, experimentally determined
value for one among the crucial, clearly defined parameters; this is the
mathematical formulation which was plagiarized, and that flagrantly at that
time, by those English courtly puppeteers steered by the Paris-based,
Venetian Abbé Antonio Conti, the Conti who was that avowed devotee of the
pathetically foolish, but nonetheless malicious Rene Descartes, a Conti who,
in concert with the depraved Voltaire, deployed the essentially silly,
black-magic devotee Isaac Newton to play the part of the plagiarist, as the
proverbial "patsy" of the crime of plagiarism in the matter of what had been
entirely Kepler's original discovery, and also that of Leibniz, a discovery,
by Kepler, which is detailed to a fine point in what had been widely
published in scientific circles in England as excerpts from Kepler's
published works.69
That said, and placed to one side for reference as needed, the formulation
for gravitation, as defined by Kepler, was widely copied into what has been
adopted dogma of the otherwise most ungrateful plagiarists of the
physical-science academia, who steal the ideas of great men and women, but
rarely acknowledge the existence of the intellectual food they have taken as
the nourishment of their sullied ambitions. That is, as it is; however, the
more fundamental aspect of Kepler's work, is not only ignored, except by
models of such actually great thinkers as Albert Einstein.
The principal fact of the matter, is, as
Einstein emphasized, that:
-
That discovery proves that the universe
is, within any apparent instant, ontologically finite; however, it
also proves, as Einstein emphasized:
-
That that same universe is unbounded,
or, in other words, that the universe is governed by a principle of
anti-entropy, and is therefore only relatively finite, only in
respect to its known, or knowable state at any time.
This fact, has the most crucially imaginable
significance for defining the underlying general principle of a modern
physical science of economy.
Indeed, examination of all of the characteristic failures of globally
extended, modern notions of economy developed in trans-Atlantic European
society, reflects systemic errors respecting principle, principles whose
violation underlies the history of persistently recurring failures of all
modern, and also earlier, forms of economies. Such is the categorical nature
of the subject-matter before us here and now.
Science is what we can prove an effect would be, an effect produced by means
we can not perceive in themselves, but only conceive, as the unseen director
of the play prompts the audience to see the drama as played on stage, rather
a drama which is playing those actors as suchat least, until after the
final curtain has rung down, when the mere players and unseen director
appear before the curtain on stage. That expresses the principle of Type
"B."
What must now be said of the practice of the science of physical economy,
must be spoken to minds viewing the subject in such terms of conceptual
reference.
It is so with the performance of the real economy, the physical economy. The
productivity (e.g., the value) lies in the the effect of the organization
"of the notes," rather than the notes as such). Therein lies the
correspondence of economy and mind.
That is why I have always succeeded in forecasting. I never "predict" as
statisticians do. I warn of the timely effects of timely choices, or
non-choices, among alternatives. When that true nature of my forecasts since
1956 is considered, my forecasts have never erred to date. When I have
warned of a timely disaster, were a certain change no made, and that warning
has been disregarded, there has been a timely disaster, as in Spring 1957,
and, more notably, 1966-1971, and, most notably, 2007.
In those times, and later, it is those who
attempt to predicted a statistical certainty contrary to my forecasts, who
have always guessed wrong.70
NOW, TO THE PHYSICS OF
ECONOMY
From here on in this chapter, what I shall say would often be considered,
ordinarily, too profound for the ears and eyes, but not the tears, of those
whom we regard as our customary fellow-citizens, or, even among what would
be supposed, ordinarily, to be most among leading relevant categories of
professionals.
However, ordinary conditions no longer exist; we
have come in times, especially since July 2007, during which ordinary
thinking has proven itself to be, now, nothing as much as a terrible
failure, and customary ways of reacting to challenges have been, in effect,
a source of disasters which now begin to be seen as fruits of absurdities
beyond customary powers of belief.
Nonetheless, that much said, here, I must take a certain risk of being,
sometimes, misunderstood by some readers, a risk rooted, so to speak, in the
stubbornly persisting habits of among both the audience for the play, and
even many among the leading actors. "The usual way of thinking" during
recent decades, has been a form of public risk akin to the practice of
medicine by amateurs, which has usually occurred, even among the usually
leading ranks of our government, but for what are, today, very rarely,
actually politically or scientifically qualified professional ranks.
We have come into a time when we are all faced, immediately, with the
urgency of what must be considered as my warning of needed action proposed
for a concert among several leading nations. The fact is, that, now, there
is no sane alternative, even in the very short term, except, often seemingly
egregious courses of action which I have prescribed for the here and now.
The hope of rescue of this planet's population demands that course of action
by me, and nothing less.
Therefore, some among you might have preferred to ignore what I shall write
in this chapter, but only at your own peril, and, also, that of your own and
many other nations, besides. Neither the presently reigning world
monetary-financial system, nor the way of thinking about economy typified by
the product of the usual daily or weekly press, nor the intention of our own
nation's institutions of government, no longer has any useful future place
on any part of this planet, even during the immediately future, or, even a
distant one.
Yet, once we have conceded the importance of the difficulties of which I
have just written here, there is another, helpful, fact to be considered.
A great portion of the adult population of the U.S.A., at least more than
half, already, has, just recently, broken free of formerly habituated
"respect" for either the recent sessions of our Federal Congress, or the
incumbent President and current composition of the U.S. Congress, alike.
Under such conditions as these (the proper definition of a "mass strike"),
it is as Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote in his A Defence of Poetry, and as
Gottfried Leibniz defined "dynamics," and as I now repeat in the passage I
shall now repeat, immediately below, from a passage which I had quoted in an
earlier chapter of this report here:
So, often in history, the time has come when the people of a nation can no
longer stomach the habits of a reigning government, such as our own at this
instant, a government which has lost all respect in the eyes of a majority
of the people, as the majority among our citizenry now have made clear, in
their showing their contempt, even disgust for the incumbent President and
present leadership of the Congress alike.
It as a majority which, also, despises the
relics of whatever passes for our own current version of an ancient regime
under the now retired President George W. Bush, Jr. and the present
President Obama, a regime which presumes, like the King Louis XVI of France
protected by the armies of an alien Austro-Hungarian emperor, in July 1789,
that it controls the situation now, as it presumed then. Such has been, so
far, the conduct of a Obama administration which presently relies upon its
submission to control over the policies of our government by an utterly
alien British empire, an empire which has been our American peoples sworn
enemy since the aftermath of Peace of Paris of February 1763. In such times
as these, the costumes of reigning authority are transformed into the image
of those despised political old rags seen in that government which our
betrayed citizens now consider as their immediate enemy.
So, think back to Shelley, and to that principle which guides an aroused
population which has chosen to cast off those who have betrayed it, as this
was expressed in those past times by the combined power of the American
people, and our allies, which were, similarly, aroused by the infamy of the
forces governing the Britain of that time:
"...The person in whom this power resides,
may often, as far as regards many portions of their nature, have little
apparent correspondence with the spirit of good of which they are the
ministers. But even whilst they deny and abjure, they are compelled to
serve that power which is seated on the throne of their own soul."
The crucial features of the work of those who
are now still the most important among relevant figures of physical science
of their time, such as Bernhard Riemann, Albert Einstein, and Academician
V.I. Vernadsky, are features which implicitly define a science of physical
economy.
These features locate the existence of mankind
as being within the power of a universal Creator, while the rest of the
matter is to be treated as that which belongs within the bounds of economy
as, in order of descending authority: first, and foremost, the creative
powers specific to the human individual, powers which, at their highest
level of expression, which are a power of mankind over the Biosphere, at the
top, and the power of both man and, second, the Biosphere over the third,
the Lithosphere, at the bottom.
The pivotal feature in what I have to write here, now, pertains to the
urgently needed introduction of not only the updated definition of the
principle of modern dynamics introduced during the 1690s, against the utter
incompetence of Rene Descartes, by Gottfried Leibniz, but also the function
of the concept of physical space-time, as opposed to clock-time, as a
central feature of the needed elimination of the not only vulgar, but
intrinsically incompetent notions of time-line as employed by those
scientifically underprivileged who have dominated both accounting and
governmental policy-shaping up to the present moment of history.
It is that which is the act of freeing even professionally informed opinion
and practice, from what must be recognized as a scientifically absurd notion
of the composition of mankind's universe, so defined, which is the essential
functional distinction, at all times, past or future, of the existence of
all mankind, which goes to the core of what I write here.
The root of a great, and, unfortunately, still widespread error of
presumption respecting the nature of mankind's role in the universe, is the
presumption that an imagined force of what is often misnamed "nature," rules
our planet and its Solar system, an arrangement to which it is presumed,
that people must submit, even their government.
The fact is, that under the rule of the Creator
of our ever-developing universe, man is the only known true authority for
decision-making other than that Creator, Himself. We are therefore
responsible, in that degree, as much for what we fail to do on that account,
as for the effect of those actions which we were willing to take.
That is the only competent definition of the nature of a truly effective
form of economy, a definition which signifies that it should be our
intention to say, that it is that practice of "a relativistic science of
physical economy" which is presently indispensable, if we are to rescue from
the deepest and most prolonged planetary dark age in actually known history
of our planet to the present date.
Thus, to be more precise in this matter, it must be emphasized here, that
there is nothing either exaggerated, intellectually skewed, or otherwise
strained , in stating here and now, that the true principles of a science of
physical economy are within the indicated domain of that notion of
universal, physical relativity associated with legitimate admiration of the
work of Albert Einstein.
As I have already pointed out, earlier in this presentation, the fact is,
that the residual portion of past investment in the scientific-technological
factor of increased potential relative population-density, as by investment
in physical capital improvements, is acting on the relative increase of the
productivity, per capita and per square kilometer, of the present economy.
This fact illustrates that point which is to be considered, on this account,
that in a manner related to the case of a future, accelerating trajectory in
a Helium-3-fuel-powered flight from Earth-orbit to Mars-orbit, and return.
Such a physical-relativistic implication of such an hypothetical (but, in
principle, feasible) future flight, must be stated in terms of the level of
present actualities, as I do in the following review of the matter here.
The subject of a science of physical economy, which is the only sane notion
of economy which can be decently considered under present conditions of the
ongoing, global, economic breakdown crisis, is thus defined in terms of the
role of the creative powers of discovery of physical, or comparably
efficient principles, as considered in the context of the notion of dynamics
introduced to the calculus by Gottfried Leibniz beginning 1690. Leibniz's
discoveries since that time, have since been realized more fully, and that
chiefly, by such means as the exemplary implications of the successive
efforts of Riemann, Einstein, and Vernadsky.
There are several crucial implications for any competent future notion of
economy, in this outlined point which I have just stated.
First, of course, the possibility of competent economic practice now
depends, especially under the unique quality of crisis encompassing the
world economy today, on understanding the evidence which proves that what I
have just written, is true. Secondly, many, including some victims of what
sometimes passes for scientific education, will either disagree, some
violently; thus, they are either showing their ignorance, or showing the
corrupting influence of widespread, increasingly abundant, modern positivist
streams of higher mis-education in such matters.
That and comparable cases taken duly into
account, the problem is that most people today think of action by mankind in
the universe, as being like moving into residence in a rental, or mortgaged
property, a choice which they may often come to view, later, as among the
roster of those things which actually possess, and, thus, oppress them;
meanwhile, usually, they have remained ignorant of the fact of the true
nature of mankind's role, as a role distinct from that of the beasts, even
though they remain, at the same time, nonetheless, members of the Noösphere,
that as Vernadsky, and, implicitly, Albert Einstein, too, defines the
Noösphere.
I emphasize, as I have indicated in earlier portions of this present report,
that the typically chief source of the popular errors of present European
culture's academic life, respecting physical and related science, is of the
same type as that of the influence of Aristotle, who represented that
fraudulent doctrine which Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound associates with the
dictate of the Olympian Zeus of that Prometheus Bound, as this is shown in
the fictional Zeus' prohibition of the knowledge and use of "fire" (e.g.,
nuclear power) by mankind.
That view of Zeus, while fictional, is also an
expression of the true root of the doctrine of the system of Aristotle, and,
consequently, of the famous hoaxster Euclid's a-priori doctrine for a purely
formal, rather than physical geometry.71
To restate the point in a way which brings forth the crucial scientific
issue here, the popular view of the universe, still today, is,
unfortunately, of a type which I have identified here, in this present
report, repeatedly, as Type "A."
Or, to illustrate the same point in a
different way, such people are the victims of something like three thousand
years of subjugation, as since the account of the Homeric siege of Troy, and
by the tragedies of Aeschylus later, to varieties of European cultures which
have behaved, apparently, both intellectually and emotionally, as victims of
social systems dominated by the European form of mental and moral illness of
that pro-Aristotelean defense of "filthy lucre" known as "monetarism."
As I have emphasized, in sundry fashions, in earlier sections of this
present report, the world as a whole has come to that point of crisis, at
which, most among the customary beliefs encountered among presumed leaders
of the most powerful nations, are now shown as having been predicated on
that popular presumption which tends to lead them to overlook, or deny,
wishfully, the most essential fact that there is a presently onrushing,
world breakdown-crisis nearing very close to its terminal state, as this
moment of writing.
So, the choice for each and all parts of
humanity, has now become, either to abandon monetarist systems, for their
replacement by credit-systems of the types implicit in the celebrated
arguments of such as the U.S.A.'s Alexander Hamilton, or to embrace the
consequence of failing to do so, now, by resolving to enjoy the dizzying,
presently accelerating roller-coaster ride to Hell, which the present global
state of monetarist practices and beliefs of most leading governments, such
as virtually all of Europe and the leading institutions of the U.S.A. would
appear determined to render fatefully inevitable at the present time.
So, William Shakespeare has warned us, still today, against even the tyrants
of our own time, as, for example, on a crucial point presented in his Julius
Caesar, as through the voice of his character Cassius, speaking to Brutus,
speaking of the tyrant Caesar:
" . . . he doth bestride the world
Like a Colossus: and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs, and peep about
To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings."
Shortly after that, Cassius asks Casca:
Cassius asks: "Did Cicero say anything?"
Casca: "Ay, he spoke Greek."
Cassius: "To what effect?"
Casca: "Nay, and I tell you that, and I'll ne'er
look you i' the face again; but those that under
stood him smiled at one another, and shook
their heads; but, for mine own part, it
was Greek to me ..."
Be careful; always read Shakespeare according to
the Type "B" rules implicit in the intention of both Classical drama, as I
have emphasized the reality of the present world-wide crisis here, earlier.
These are, for example:
-
Cassius to Brutus: That the
historical process is dynamic, not what would be identified as
"Cartesian." or "Liberal," or the typically Liberal misreading of
the individual figure of Shakespeare's dramas, as by those
academically schooled "traditions" of the Twentieth Century
education, as still met today.
-
Casca to Cassius: evasion of
discussion of the existence of a higher viewpoint located in
dynamics. The apparent loss of a memory of the experience of a
Classical Greek civilization, defines the higher sort of tragic
feature within which the drama of the play is situated, So, Casca's
reaction to Cassius' question, is typified by the implications of
the briefly recurring references to Cicero within the play.
Shakespeare clearly intends to make that point by the brief, but
nonetheless crucial treatments of the subject of Cicero in that
play.
For many, perhaps, the second of those two
points will appear, mistakenly, to be a remote factor, if one at all.
The crucial, sometimes fatal error in that sort
of criticism of my argument, is that truly efficient ideas in history are
never discrete events, but, as Shelley emphasizes in his
A Defence of Poetry, express a direction in the
dynamic ruling over the unfolding evolution of cultural development in a
certain direction, as in the case of a true mass strike process such as
that in the 1989 DDR.
Without taking into account the powerful
influence of what had been a profoundly superior Greek cultural basis than
that developed of Latin, as the older Italian praised by Dante Aligheiri is
a better language for beautiful singing than Latin, there can be no
competent insight into the actual state of Rome at the actual time of the
real-life Caesar and the plotters. So, often, as in this case of the
relationship of the Greek legacy to the Roman culture, it is the mightier
which has fallen because of a fatal folly, while the inferior, like jackals
and hyenas by night, seizes the fallen as prey.
A majority of our citizenry, here in the U.S.A., have just recently ceased
to be underlings. Most among them will agree with me, as I develop the
richer ironies of stating that point here: It is about time!
The points which I have emphasized, briefly, thus, here, could be readily
overlooked for reason of the widely shared, mistaken presumption, that ideas
occurring within the mind of the individual, are ontologically discrete in
their nature, as their nature is presumed, mistakenly, to be limited to the
character of the individual's products.
That mistaken assumption has been reenforced in
modern European practice, by that prevalent credulity, as by university
students and graduates, which prompts so many among them to assume that the
individual discovery is an hermetically discrete form of existence in
respect to those ideas, which they presume, implicitly, to be ontologically
discrete, both in form and other characteristics.
In other words, the notion
of the infinitesimal is wrongly presumed to be ontologically Cartesian in
form, as the thoroughly foolishly de Moivre, D'Alembert, Euler, et al.
presumed respecting a calculus which they assumed, foolishly, to be an
outgrowth of the mere mathematical method of "infinite series," a method
which is widely favored in academia and kindred places, still today,
favored, most notably, by our contemporary dupes of the evil Paolo Sarpi, an
opinion which has been often put in place of that Leibniz infinitesimal
which is defined as the efficient adumbration of a subsuming dynamic
principle.
In human behavior, ideas corresponding to a notion of principle, are rooted
in a subsuming , continuing process of the history of the development of
those ideas which correspond to the kinds of controlling principle rooted,
as if hereditarily, in a history of the continuing development of those
conceptions which are to be treated as expressions of physically efficient,
non-Aristotelean (e.g., non-Euclidean) universal principles.
-
For example: If we trace the origins of
the dynamic quality of its functioning from the process of of the
history of the emergence of ancient Roman history since
approximately the sixth century B.C., we must note the traces,
through, in significant part, the earlier channels of the Hittites
and the later Etruscans, since about the approximately 1800-1400
B.C. Hittite regime in what we know presently as the ancient Turkey
centered east of the Halys River, and, also, in the intersection of
that with the impact of ancient Greek culture, in pre-shaping the
culture of what became Caesar's Rome. On this account, we must
discriminate between the relatively more powerful force of
evolutionary development of culturally heritable, implicitly
universal conceptions, from those notions which are of lesser,
relatively transitory influence on the culture in general.
-
Consider, for example, the powerfully
subsuming influence of Mediterranean maritime culture since ancient
Greece's defeat of the attempted control of the region of the
eastern Mediterranean through the "Persian Wars," and also the still
earlier impact of the siege of Troy on all of the cultures
converging on Italy. Just so, does the culture of the anti-oligarchical,
English-speaking U.S.A. differ, qualitatively, functionally, and
systemically, from that English-speaking culture which, the latter,
is still situated within the characteristically oligarchical
tradition of cultures, expressed top, down, in Europe, even to the
present day. We must take into account the difference between
American patriots from the typical subjects of the United Kingdom
and its erstwhile colonial possessions, a difference which has often
been fairly identified as two cultures separated, systemically, by
the culturally differing social intentions embedded in the use of a
common language.
-
For example, consider those same,
comparable two instances, British versus American, of contrasting
expressions of a common language: the mass-strike phenomenon which
has erupted in the U.S. population since the August closing of the
most recent session of the U.S. Congress, as comparable in
similarities of character to the "mass strike" which brought down
the DDR system.
The most notable feature of that development, is to be seen in the
fact that the DDR dominated by the Soviet Union, resisted, as, for
example, in Saxony, that artificially induced, morally degenerate,
pro-existentialist ideology of the post-1945 Congress of Culture
Freedom (CCF), a British-devised strategic policy of uprooting the
Franklin Roosevelt legacy, an anti-Roosevelt scheme which had
significantly corrupted the German population of western-occupied
Germany, especially the pro-existentalist currents of German
young-adults born after 1945, whereas, ironically, for just the
reason of the Soviet encouragement of the fostering a traditionally
German Classical culture in East Germany, as typified, most clearly,
by the cases of the cities of Leipzig and Dresden in 1989-1990.
Thus, in that comparison, the 1989 mass-strike
revolt against the DDR regime, had the distinctive character of the
resonance of the repeated: "Wir sind das Volk!" a dynamical form of outcry
which expresses the same species of mass-strike phenomenon which we should
recognize now as the presently ongoing August eruption of a mass-strike of
the majority of the adult U.S. population against the hated regime, with its
frankly Hitler-like, mass-murderous health-care policy, which that present
majority of the U.S. population has recognized in the succession of the
already predatory George W. Bush, Jr. Presidency, and the presently, already
worse Obama Presidency.
The expression which Shakespeare introduces in defining the character of the
assassinated Julius Caesar's successors, through the role of the
negotiations, on the isle of Capri, between that creature, called Octavian,
which would name itself Caesar Augustus, and the representatives of the
priesthood of the cult of Mithra assembled there, characterizes the exact
manner in which the continuing, ulcerous conflict of the post-Second Punic
War period, among near-Asia, Egypt, and Rome, was resolved in favor of a
single, Mediterranean, monetarist form of empire of Rome which was,
actually, dominated by the priestly influence of the cult of Delphi over
Rome, through the time of the incumbency of last potent high priest of the
ancient and evil Cult of Delphi, the sophist Plutarch.
To make the point respecting Shakespeare's drama clearer at this point in my
report, there is no natural culture among the animals, except as in the case
of domesticated animals, notably dogs properly trained by transference of
a family-like allegiance to human owners, after the initial weeks of their
lives following the primary weaning period, or the different, but comparable
case of the domestication of horses. Everything respecting human social
behavior in societies, expresses the cultural evolution, as of what is most
conveniently identified as a relevant set of converging language-cultures,
reaching back to roots even hundreds of generations earlier.
So, Shakespeare's Cassius pointed to a dominant, dynamic, role of Julius
Caesar which is typical of the Roman culture of that time.
The alternative
to the cultural impulses defining the assassination of Julius Caesar and the
conduct which broke out almost immediately among the quarreling assassins,
is located within what Shakespeare rightly emphasizes are the deep roots of
the Etruscan-Greek antecedents of Roman ideology, since no later than the
reforms of the Gracchi's settling native-Italian speakers among the veteran
Roman legionnaires as farmers in Italy, as, later, the Italian-speaking
veterans who founded, then, the presently Italian languages of the Iberian Penninsula, France, and Roumania in their respective dialects, as in what
became known as what Dante Alighieri emphasized as being the originally
Italian-speaking (rather than Latin) Iberian peninsula, France, and
Roumania.72
The case of Caesarian Roman empire established through Octavian's
negotiations within the cult of Mithra, is what became specific to the
ensuing empire; but, the sociology of such phenomena is the matter of more
general relevance, especially in the specific type of culture of a
Maritime-based monetarist culture, rooted in the Mediterranean development
around Greece, Egypt, and Italy, as extended further into the principal
slavic languages and dialects, including what had once been Greek-speaking,
eastern Europe.
It is a related fact, that throughout his work, Shakespeare emphasizes the
principled notion of "self"-consciousness in his style of dialogue, as he
composes the dialogues of this referenced location. That is to say, that the
audience is induced to believe in the stage-induced illusion of that merely
staged character's simulation of a thinking self, an imitation whose
characteristics are to be adduced from expressions of behavior which may not
be explicitly presented in the drama, or reflects a personality who, often,
either does not actually appear as that character identified as on the
stage, or is presented as having died earlier in the unfolding of the drama
(as the matter of the ghost in Hamlet).
Such is similar to the continuing role of Julius
Caesar's influence on the history of the conspirators, once dead, since his
assassination, is referenced throughout the remainder of the Shakespeare
play, but, if as he, or she were nothing more substantial than what appears
on stage as, like the ghostly person thinking, if viewed according to the
principle of "Type 'B'," as the ghostly presence of nothing other than the
playwright's own expressed consciousness of such relationships.
That is to speak of the consciousness of his own
self as author and director of the dramas, by the playwright Shakespeare, as
a Classical playwright's intention to define that object which is intended
to be represented to the audience as what appears to the audience as the
mental-emotional state of each of the designed characters in the playas it
is in the Passions of J.S. Bach, and the masses and musical dramas of Mozart
and Beethoven.
Such lessons, as from Classical traditions of practice in drama and poetry,
reflect and typify the higher-ranking context in which the historical
determination of the course of such phenomena as economies, are subsumed, as
Shelley indicated in his A Defence of Poetry, by the influence of the
dynamic form of expression of the human will within society, and on the
economy of society.
The interdependent cases of the U.S. Declaration
of Independence, Hamilton's principle of the national bank, and the highest
authority in U.S. Constitutional law, the Preamble of that Constitution, are
typical of the expression of such principle of Leibnizian dynamics in the
determination of the course of the history of a nation and its culture over
the longer term.
So, in a competent presentation of great Classical drama, pain as such never
actually appears on stage, but only the audience's contemplation of the
audience's own sense of the created stage-character's adumbrated own pain,
or, better, what that character's role which he, or she implies as the
senses as being experienced by another, as being implied from behind the
mask. The witting member of the audience is struggling with this, as if to
seek to embrace, or deny, those passions which are only implicitly, rather
than actually expressed by the suggestion of the actions on stage.
The superior mind of the playwright or director
of the drama, but not the actor on stage, must, all at the same time,
experience the echoed sense of the real pain, or other passion, of the
character who exists only in that reality for which the drama on stage is
but a cast shadow, but which the audience may experience, as a prescience
within itself, by means of such things as the imagined experience attributed
by the audience to its imagined character in the play on stage.73
Thus, only a degenerate sort of author or director of a drama ever puts the
bloody passions and pains of the part played explicitly "on stage." as I saw
a foolish Sir Lawrence Olivier do that, and, then, later, defend this
doctrine of practice in a later autobiographical interview recorded for
posterity. Rather, in the Classical drama, or great Classical poetry, such
as that of Percy Bysshe Shelley's view in writing his A Defence of Poetry,
it is intended that the audience, which must experience the sense of the
passion, or the pain, in themselves, must do this only in the same manner as
the author of the drama has intended the shadows of the drama to suggest.
It is the plausible cause and the effect of the
indicated passion, or pain, as experienced by the audience, which is the
subject in the drama itself, not the passion or pain in itself. So, the
Christian of the New Testament, for example, does not experience Jesus's own
pain in the crucifixion, but, as in the properly insightful performance of
Mozart's Ave Verum Corpus, the passion associated with the implications of
the a power of the sublime idea of a denoted pain which could ever be
attained in an ordinary way, by an ordinary human individual, otherwise.
So, Shelley argues the case implicitly in the concluding paragraph of his A
Defence of Poetry.
As a matter of contrasts, the existentialist experiences the futility of
his, or her own existence, by the rejecting, that with impassioned devotion
to the sensual experience of unreality, of both the existence of an actual
Type "B" human mind, and a personality of a higher principle expressed by
the existence of the living mind of a mortal human personality.
The Classical configuration, and its adversary, the cases which I have
illustrated, and thus contrasted in these immediate pages, just now, is a
reflection of the same, Type "B." state of mind on which a competent science
of economy depends, absolutely.
Science, Dynamics &
Drama
A grandfather says to the child, "I built this." Or, another grandfather
reports, "This was built during my time." Or, nobler soul, another says: "In
my time I did experience some of what we did then, but my part was not so
important for me, now, when I look back, as the privilege I enjoyed in
contributing something to the work led by some of the greatest leaders of
our time."
Mankind is the only living expression of those who behave in the manner of
immortal living beings.
The durable values to be assigned to the efforts
and experience of the living individual, are expressed in the continuity of
some progress rooted in what was ongoing before a person had been born,
which, with his, or her participation, was the premise for further progress
in this matter after he had died. In other words, the true value, and
reality of life's experience, lies not in the merely perceived, mortal form
of the living creature, but the infinitesimal as an efficient principle of
change which moves the embodied shadows of our souls, as the physical
principle of the infinitesimal was so defined by Leibniz, contrary to Abbé
Conti, de Moivre, Euler, et al.
Where, then, is the character Hamlet's sometimes alleged "fatal error," if,
indeed, there was ever any historical error specific to him, individually,
at all? Rather, Hamlet was self-doomed by his submission to the dynamics of
nothing different than that reigning culture of that people at that time, by
his refusal to violate the social characteristic (i.e., cultural dynamic) of
that self-doomed culture, and not by anything which might be judged a moral
error from the standpoint of that state of belief which permeated that
entire culture, dynamically. What does Shelley suggest to such effect in the
conclusion of his A Defence of Poetry? We are, thus, by such questions,
thrown back to the principle of dynamics.
As in the cases of Shakespeare's dramas MacBeth, Lear, and Hamlet, our
thoughts are driven back, by Shakespeare's clearly expressed intention, as
if to point, in this fashion of the Classical dramatist, to the depraved
moral state of England at that time in his own life's experience at the time
of his writing, a state which had been brought about, in then more recent
developments, by the process leading into the accession of the foolish son,
James I, of a butchered Mary, Queen of Scots.
Here, under James I, and under the influence of
the utterly evil Paolo Sarpi, we are witnessing a dynamic in an English
culture which had been shifted away from what it had seemed to be in times
prior to the assassination of Christopher Marlowe, shifted in a way which
carried the Mayflower to the Portuguese fisherman's settlement latter called
Provincetown, whence the Mayflower was guided to what became known as the
Plymouth settlement of Massachusetts.
So, in the plays portraying a state of what appears, on the surface, to be
hopeless cases of despair, such as Lear, MacBeth, and Hamlet, plays which
Shakespeare composed under the shade of the evil times which fell upon
England then, as upon him personally, he composed what are intrinsically
ugly dramas set within what were typical hopeless cultures, but,
nevertheless, doing this with a cleverly, deviously inserted assertion of an
higher historical optimism, an optimism as expressed in the mind of the
person who can see his present condition as in the mirror of the happier
tradition of Henry VIIs debt to the model achievement of Frances Louis XI
which had been the reflection, in the mirror of time, of Henry VIIs triumph
over the ancient evil of Richard III.
As I have warned many times during recent
decades, to understand the subversive powers of evil, is to strengthen not
only a passion for the good, but to suggest a strategy by which that evil,
once understood, could be defeated, all on the ongoing course of the
struggle for good, against the usually prevalent force of evil; we must do
this, for, often, in history, we have no moral option but to do so, as we
must do now, as the image of Jesus crucifixion, for the sake of future
humanity, a crucifixion which was a crime done by the will of the long arm,
reaching from the Isle of Capri to Golgotha, by the Satanic hand of an evil
Tiberius' Rome.
In the later productions of Shakespeare, we meet dramas devoted to the
subject of bad, even pervasively evil cultures, in the tradition for evil
which had been assumed by England in the later part of Shakespeare's life.
Those were, chiefly, dramas which echo the evil
of those times under the tyranny of such among Shakespeare's enemies as
Sarpi's Francis Bacon; but, by looking evil in the eye, so to speak, as in
the tradition of evil represented by MacBeth, Lear, and Hamlet, a higher
truth is expressed in through the means of a seemingly hopeless situation,
even as if slyly, in such a fashion that the circle around the great
minister of the Leibniz legacy, Abraham Kästner, that circle of Gotthold
Lessing and Moses Mendelssohn, would arouse the real Shakespeare as if from
the grave, into which the tradition of Paolo Sarpi's captive London had
intended to dump him, into a rebirth of dynamic quality aroused in Kästner's
Germany, up and out of the rubbish-bin which was the dominant British
culture of that time, through a role of Kästner et al., a turn which made
possible what a Kästner, who had died in A.D. 1800, a Kästner then based at
Göttingen, had intended, earlier, to become the victory of of Benjamin
Franklin's circle in the American revolution of 1776.
Goodness does not descend upon us from above. Goodness achieves its goal as
a quality of merit, through the arm which dares to combat evil, and to seek
to destroy the evil which infects men and women as like a loathsome disease.
Evil might be fought as a thing to be destroyed, but to accomplish that,
there must be goodness in ones self, as we remember that great President
Abraham Lincoln who by defeating the British adversary, by choosing to
defend the Union, made possible the freeing of the who the British and their
Spanish stooges had enslaved, slaves freed by no other means than Lincolns
defense of the Union, in the only possible way this victory over slavery
here could have ever occurred. Frederick Douglass had understood that that
issue must be fought, but Lincoln showed him the instrument of the higher
means, the Federal Union, by which the victory could be actually won.
There had come a time, when Shakespeare was soon to be banned from further
intrusions upon the English stage of his time, as by the circles of Bacon,
in the time of the reign of Sarpi's pirate crew. Nonetheless, later, as
during the early Eighteenth Century, when Shakespeare's work was performed
in English only as a travesty of its true self, the work of the actual
Shakespeare surged triumphantly in Germany in the time of Kästner, Gotthold
Lessing, Moses Mendelssohn, as this was reflected in the higher order of
genius of Friedrich Schiller, as also in the rise of a great new nation
which the German Renaissance which Lessing's, Mendelsohn's, and Friedrich
Schiller's work reflected in our own North America.
So, all true prophets are often devoted to what often appears to be the
hopeless cause of such an outcome of a present devotion to a happy future,
but, for all that, as Robbie Burns would have said, this sows seeds of
triumph in later times. In the end, from those darkest final years of his
commitment as a playwright, and the consequent stilling of the motion of his
pen, Shakespeares immortal mission triumphed from out of the darkness, in
the end, in the later time of Lessing and Schiller, and truth be known,
Bernhard Riemann, too.
Such is the nature of human immortality, when we have the good sense to
commit our life to dwelling in that realm beyond our often impoverished
present conception of the passage of historical time, an accomplishment
rooted in our intention to bring forth such a future outcome.
That is, rooted, not by chance, that the
essential article of Christian faith of martyred Peter and Paul, and of the
John who survived those times, is a faith in the simultaneity of eternity, a
faith, such as that of Paul's First Corinthians 13, expressed in relatively
lesser, but necessary achievements, such as man's coming to live, and reign,
in performing the work assigned to us by the Creator, our labor as His true
emissaries, the mission which we must therefore conduct, from this day
onward, among the galaxies.
Against that background, the work of Academician V. I. Vernadsky, more than
any other scientific figure up through his lifetime, presents an argument,
premised on crucial scientific evidence, which implicitly defines mankind as
the ruler of the system we inhabit, rather than as adapting to merely
material circumstances which exist independently of our will, rather than as
the legacies of the evil Olympian Zeus and Aristotle would demand such
self-degradation of us, still.
Properly human adaptation signifies the obligation to make those changes in
the universe on which the continuation of our species' existence now
depends, considerations which compel us to reign over the part of the
universe which we presently inhabit, reigning through our creative powers to
change that part of the existing potential of our universe to our species'
advantage. When we summon that authority which has been given to us by our
given nature as creative minds, we are inspired, and may be, thus, committed
to do great things.
This set of relations is typified in a general
way by the fact that the continued existence of our species demands shifts
in technology along a line of development traced , in succession, from the
burning of wood, to the power of nuclear fission, thermonuclear fusion, and
qualitatively higher energy-flux densities, beyond that. This line of
development is not optional; it does increase man's power to exist, but,
without it, we could not continue to exist in a either civilized form, or
without suffering catastrophic shrinkages in potential relative
population-density of our species as a whole.
We, humanity, have now, reached the verge of the point at which commitment
to the extraterrestrial extension of the habitation of our species becomes
mandatory. It is a challenge for which we could have become prepared, even
two or three decades ago; but, the influence of the upper ranks of that
presently, still reigning social cast born since the aftermath of World War
II, was pushing society backwards, in the opposite, neo-malthusian
direction, especially the (actually) fascist left only typified by the
fascist Weatherman bandits around Columbia Universitys Mark Rudd, and
kindred expressions of existentialist fascism in Europe.
Specifically, much of the body of ideas needed
to begin that extension, already existed as knowledge in some phase of
actual development by about the time of the Moon-landing.
Also, at that same time, in the late 19860s, the space-program as fostered
by the dramatic initiatives of President John F. Kennedy, was advancing by
proverbial leaps and bounds within the aspect of the national U.S. economy
focused upon the space-program itself, despite the otherwise reigning moral
and physical decay of the U.S.A., during the time following President
Kennedys assassination, during the reign of the will to do evil expressed
by the Warren Commission.
In that limited sector of our economy, by about
the time of the Moon-landing, we were generating an fairly estimated ten
cents worth of growth through science-driven progress, for each penny
spent. It was the other parts of the economy, not the aerospace venture,
which were the already looming threat of failure, since about 1966-1968.
Since that time of the Moon-landings, there have been no more such U.S.
manned landings on that Moon, during four decades, up to the present day.
Meanwhile, back on Earth, the decadence of our planet's culture under the
influence of the existentialist "68ers," has carried us all to the present
moment of a world teetering at the brink of Hell
Nonetheless, similarly, in France, Germany, and Italy, as also in the Soviet
Union and the "East bloc" sector, up to the early period of the U.S. Reagan
administration, there were still advanced technologies, such as "scramjet"
technologies and related designs of related aerodynamics, as I had indicated
in my 1988 campaign telecast, The Woman on Mars. The ended with the evil
pact against Germany created by Britain's Margaret Thatcher, France's
President Mitterand, and America's perennial, not so very bright, British
stooge, President George H. W. Bush.
Otherwise, the U.S. economy failed, first under the effects of the Kennedy
assassinations of the 1960s, the utterly fraudulent launching of the
protracted U.S. war in Indo-China, in 1964, and in the rising tide of
"environmental" contraction of the U.S. economy's net investment in basic
economic infrastructure during the 1966-1971 interval.
Thus, since March 1,
1968, the U.S.A. itself has undergone more than four decades of
self-inflicted, net rot and ruin, all this chiefly the result of trends in
policy-shaping guided by each and every Federal government which was
installed from 1969, on, as extended to the presently accelerated moral and
economic mass-insanity of the presently utterly truth-free Obama
administration and its Hitler- and also Tony Blair-copied (NICE) death-care
policies.
The U.S. economy is not merely collapsing, at ever-accelerated rates
currently; contrary to all of the stream of ritual lies from President
Obama's inner, British imperialism-oriented, behaviorist circles, our only
hope for the continued existence of the United States, is to terminate both
all of the recent economic and related policies of the George W. Bush, Jr.
and present Obama administration's policies thus far, and to put the U.S.
economy through reorganization-in-bankruptcy to the purpose of converting
the economy, immediately, from a part of a presently self-doomed, global
monetary system, to a U.S. constitutional form of fixed-exchange-rate
credit-system, a system crafted in cooperation with both certain other
leading nations and willing others.
This can only be achieved by any existing nation of this planet today,
through an emergency agreement among the United States, Russia, China,
India, and other willing-partner nations. With such a reform soon enacted, a
general recovery of the planet as a whole can be mobilized, according to the
precedents of such as Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Abraham
Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt. Such actions would, if taken now, rescue
the world from the present, immediate prospect of an immediate plunge into a
global new dark age of all humanity. Any contrary inclination would turn out
to have been a lurch into global genocide.
For such a recovery program, a commitment to the industrialization of our
Moon and the ensuing colonization of Mars, are the indispensable choices for
an already overdue general process of economic recovery for our planet as a
whole, as President Franklin Roosevelt had intended, had he not been
replaced by that ugly scoundrel Truman.
With that perspective in view, the principal parameters of the design for a
general recovery can be defined, summarily, as follows.
The Spatial Outlines
of Physical Economy
There are no fixed properties in our universe, despite some commonplace
delusions among some of the so-called "property owners."
Neither Earth, nor
our Sun, enjoy the actual authority of permanent titles of ownership of
property-titles within the present or future "real estate" within our
universe. If humanity were to linger too long mired in greedy complacency on
Earth, our Earth-bound human species might, one day, suddenly, be gone, an
event which would be of no moral consequence for those children of Satan
called "existentialists."
That is not a "forecast;" it is a question for
which the needed response must be discovered.
Therefore, if we actually desire to acquire a system which affords our
species a secured future, we have better turn now, to define the principles
of the practice of economy, by proceeding from conceptions which are a way
of looking, backwards-in-time, from the future, to our present time for
policy-shaping on Earth. We must now, looking from that standpoint in some
nearby future decades, into a future time when mankind has established an
inhabited extension of its own future existence on the nearby planet Mars.
Not that Mars were likely to be a good climate at the future time the Earth
might go under; but, the colonization of Mars is an indispensable
stepping-stone toward human life within our galaxy, and beyond.
Like the the relevant aspect of the state of mind of Christopher Columbus of
about A.D. 1480, some things about a future re-discovery of a continent on
the other side of the Atlantic, were, looking back to then, already clear to
us. What is clear includes the fact that making the discovery is necessary
for mankind living beyond and beyond Europe. Otherwise, as then, there is
much to be discovered, and many plans, yet to be adjusted, explored.
That perspective for mankind today, is a concept which is no idle fantasy,
but is the clear vision of the reality of a future time when men and women
could traverse the distance between the orbits of Mars and Earth, within a
journey, as if under an impulse of one-gravity acceleration/deceleration, of
several days. At that, or any comparable speed, the later exploration of our
galaxy is opened up for the future "Mayflower" colonists of mankind. Beyond
that, there is much which remains to be, urgently, discovered.
In the meantime, we have entered a part of history, now, when what had been
recently considered the limiting practice of policy-shaping for our economy,
is doomed forever by its own, systemic quality of obsolescence.
Such a the tide of presently accumulated
obsolescence of our U.S. economic policy, began with effects which began to
unfold in the aftermath of the November 22, 1963 assassination of U.S.
President John F. Kennedy.
The significance of that assassination on history
since that day, was first shown clearly, with the fraud employed to bring
about that August 7, 1964. so-called Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which, in
turn, began U.S.s self-ruinous engagement in the subsequent second,
post-World War II, wasting war in Indo-China, and in virtually coincident,
subsequent, October 1964 installation of the first of the two evil British
governments of Prime Minister Tony Blairs predecessor of similar bent,
Harold Wilson.
So, the United States began its long process of
degeneration into its present economic condition, and, so, the shift of
world power away from the United States, back to the securing of the
renewed, dominant influence of the British monetary systems international
political influence of the British Empire over the U.S.A., as this
transpired under the U.S. Nixon Administration, and the recent installation
of the successive, virtually British puppet-Presidencies of the U.S.A. under
Presidents George W. Bush, Jr., and Barack Obama, so, to the present day
these words are being written here.
Now, as this present report was being completed, at the approaching onset of
a globally fateful Autumn 2009, we had already entered a unique state of
world affairs which has a certain resemblance in the economics domain to the
hyperinflationary breakdown of the economy of Weimar Germany through its
Spring-Autumn 1923 hyperinflationary collapse.
Now, we have entered a
comparable, but global hyperinflation of entire world's monetary system, to
the accompaniment of a financial collapse of that same world system.
[[See current edition of the Triple Curve]]
The only way in which the present nations of the
planet might be able choose to live on this planet, at this present time of
an onrushing, global breakdown-crisis, depends upon the assumption that we,
of the United States defined by its unique constitutional history, choose to
change from our recent, richly perverted ways, by a sudden reform of the
type which I have prescribed.
Without that change, there is no presently
calculable hope for avoiding a plunge of the entire planet into an early
general breakdown-crisis of a type most recently experienced in Europe's
Fourteenth-century "New Dark Age."
Therefore, we of the U.S.A. must now resume, full force, President John F.
Kennedy's "hard" mission, as a starting-point for a genuine, durable,
long-term recovery of the economy of the U.S.A., and, also, our planet.
The manner in which we might, choose, successfully, to outlive a pending
doom which has brought to our planet's doors, a catastrophe brought upon all
nations by, chiefly, the British imperial control of the world's essentially
Keynesian monetary system, is one which , in many among its leading
respects, will not appear to be much different from a prosperous version of
life here, as we had assumed that case about the time of President Franklin
Roosevelt's death. Money, and its use within the terms of the national
sovereignties of the partners operating as national credit-systems, will
persist for one or two generations or longer.
That progress on Earth itself will be the
context in which those traditional arrangements within which the essential
changes will operate. What President John F. Kennedy proposed be the landing
on the Moon, will be the keystone for launching the principal change which
the sovereign nations of the planet will experience for about two
generations, or more, yet to come. Nothing consistent with the idea of weird
arrangements is to be expected for that future time-frame, by any sane adult
living today.
In the meantime, presuming that we of the U.S., reverse the catastrophically
ruinous, and even implicitly mass-murderous present policies of the current
U.S. Obama administration, during those coming generations, as under my
proposed reforms, we can still not merely survive, and even recover
economically, but will have the means available to bring forth the
seed-forms of crucial changes in man's relationship to the nearby regions of
the Solar System itself.
These implicitly wonderful changes in the
present prospects for all mankind, will have immediately beneficial effects
which will be modest, but nonetheless terribly important during the short
term, but whose long-term consequences for all mankind which will be felt
only gradually by each successive generation, that over the course of
several successive generations, as we, first, develop an industrial
capability on Earth's "Fifth Continent," the Moon, a capability which will
be the indispensable prerequisite for undertaking any actual colonization of
Mars.
The one great technological change will must be immediate. It will be,
first, the delivery of material which is shipped to the vicinity of Mars,
and to the surface of that planet, from, chiefly, our Moon. This will be
material which is fabricated, more and more, in the, largely "automated,"
"industrial workshops" of that Moon, as such a prospect was presented by the
great rocket-scientist Krafft Ehricke..
On the Moon, the muscles of mankind are to be used, essentially, for
maintaining the good repair of human bodies in a very much less than perfect
environment for our living species. The idea of "health care" will assume
characteristic features beyond the imagination of most notions of practice
currently.
The most crucial change will be a reflection of
the feasibility of the development of vehicles which will come to carry
human crews and passengers at, preferably, one-gravity rates of
acceleration/deceleration, between Earth-orbit and Mars-orbit, flights
powered by the development of thermonuclear fusion which, employs the Moons
stock of Solar-radiation-deposited Helium-3 isotope, for use in such
undertakings as human travel to Mars during a lapsed-time interval of a
little as several days, from the Moon orbit, to what will become, during the
interim the development of the orbiting and landing of man-made artifacts,
that a revolution in both the lunar orbiting of Mars will emerge through the
role of, products of descent from Mars-orbit to that planet's surface, and
beneath.
It is in the decades of preparation for actually human travel between
Moon-orbit and Mars-Moon-orbit, that the next great leap of man into space
will be prepared. That preparation will, indeed, have increasing impact in
promoting the increasingly exciting pleasures of experiencing the
development of mankind here, back on Earth itself.
Amid this, the most singularly exciting development to be contemplated here
and now, will be the relativistic effects on the passengers, of the approach
to one-gravity-rates of acceleration/deceleration between, to and from the
Solar orbits of Earth and Mars, that during lapsed times of
thermonuclear-fusion powered travels, each way, measured, probably, and
possibly, in as short a span as in a few days.
This transition from Mach-2 speeds of flight, as
by the preferred, more economical, "scramjet" technology, to flight via the
medium of relativistic physical space-time, must be the case, if we do not
wish crew and passengers to arrive in something approaching the hapless
condition approaching that of "blobs," rather than, at the time of reaching
their destinations, articulate living bodies suited for piloting return
trips, .
From the exterior viewpoint of this development of such accelerated travel,
by that observer still on Earth,, the role of speeds of relativistic travel
sustained through acceleration, might not be so readily comprehended by a
disinterested observer from the side-lines of such events. It is clear that
we must take up, very seriously, the issue of the problematic effects of
lowered gravity experienced on the Moon, Mars, or in inertial forms of
in-space-flight. It is from the standpoint of the insider of that
accelerated travel-experience, pointing to the role of Helium-3 isotope as a
considered fuel, that the significance of such constantly accelerated rates
becomes clearer, even from reflection on this experienced today.
Suddenly, when the implications of what I have
just stated here, sinks in, at least a little bit, what confronts in such
reflections, is the notion of man's practice of physical science from within
the geometry of Albert Einstein's Riemannian notion of relativistic physical
space-time.
In broad terms, the notion of feasibility of emerging future action of this
sort, is already understandable within the frameworks of our political and
scientific culture. The problem is that, to make the point gently, that the
side-effects are not presently worked out to any relevant, known person's
satisfaction. I emphasize, once again, that what we do know, as Christopher
Columbus, similarly, by A.D. 1480, knew already, from his studies of
Nicholas of Cusa's proposal, that there was a continent on the westerly side
of the Atlantic, and knew the approximate distance, partly through his
experience as a mariner in the Portuguese Atlantic service of that time,
through the notes of Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa on the launching of such a
project, and also the scientific advice given to Columbus by Cusa's
surviving associates.
The chief problem which Columbus faced,
otherwise, was not the pains of the work of exploration, but the ruinous
effects supplied, like a dagger thrust in the back of civilization as a
whole, by the Grand Inquisitor Torquemada of imperial Habsburg Spain.
For such reasons, it was the combination of the colonization of
Massachusetts, in a smaller, but crucial colonization of Plymouth, and the
weightier venture of the Winthrops and Mathers, which has been so far the
unique historical factor in steps toward the realization of the prospect of
Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa. That role of Cusa has been of manifold, crucial
importance in the achievement of what became our United States.
Manufactured products shipped, are not the principal problem of
interplanetary travel.
The principal problem to be solved is,
essentially, the matter of the implications of the travel of human beings
within a physical-relativistic medium of constantly powered flight.
Implicitly, it is solvable; but, there is much work to be done to overcome
the proverbial scientific and other "bugs" to be associated with the
indispensably relativistic transport of human beings.
The combination of the psychological implications of relativistic
interplanetary travel, on the one hand, and the economic implications of
this, deserve some special attention, here, before returning to consider the
new economic system to be established on Earth, as a process of development
converging, more and more, on the effects of economically-relevant travel,
in physical-relativistic modes, within the emerging shared economy of Earth
and Mars.
An Economy With
Relativistic Effects
At the arrival of that moment when the intended effects of relativistic
flights between Earth-and Mars-orbit, have sunk into the consciousness of
people here on Earth, a great revolution in the existence of all mankind
will have begun: admittedly, this will occur only if the leading nations of
the world take the steps which I have prescribed for preventing an
immediate, general physical, as much as monetary-financial breakdown,
chain-reaction style, of the leading national economies of this planet.
If we may presume the urgently needed, happier,
revolutionary changes in the world's current financial-monetary policies,
the fellow-positivist associate of David Hilbert, Hermann Minkowski, will
appear to some as a hero, with certain qualifying considerations.74
Otherwise, it will be those who stayed with Bernhard Riemann, Albert
Einstein, and Academician Vernadsky, who will have been, actually, fully
vindicated, as having provided the true foundations of a true modern
science, at the time of such a development. It is this change in popular
attitudes (e.g., dynamics), more than any actual beginning of the
colonization of a nearby planet, beyond our Moon, which will be "the
revolution" to which I have just referred, here.
In the meanwhile, with the world economic breakdown-crisis presently already
at full tilt, the terrible performance reflected by the habits found among
most of the world's present economists, accountants, and the like, have, in
fact, already been put on the record the fact of their contemptible, failed
forecasts respecting any actually important development. Most among them
have been consistently incompetent, on the record, since no later than the
time of my own first, professional, economic forecast, of the early 1957
U.S. recession, a forecast which I had made during the late Summer of 1956.
The fault of the typical opponents of my
approach over the decades since, lies in the underlying assumptions which
most of them, to the present day, had absorbed from a blend of what became
the popular superstitions and kindred academic doctrine since that
inauguration of President Harry Truman which had enabled London's lackeys in
Wall Street to introduce the post-FDR misdirection of the U.S. economy.
For the purposes of this report, now, consider the most notable such cases
of my longer-term forecasting, following my rather uniquely successful
short-term forecast of an approximately February-March 1957 "deepest
recession of the post-war years." The highlights of that experience have
been the following:
Consider the following, most significant, case in point. During late 1958
through 1961, I had warned that, if the current long-term trend in U.S.
Federal economic policies under the Keynesian policies of the Eisenhower
Administration's viciously incompetent Professor Arthur Burns 75
were continued through the first half of the 1960s, there would be a series
of crucial disturbances during the second half of the 1960s, leading toward
a breakdown of the system which could be estimated as beginning between
sometime near the end of that decade, and the beginning of the 1970s. By
1966-1971, every leading rival of mine among economists at that time, were
relying on the assumption, voiced in virtual unison by them, that "the
built-in stabilizers" would prevent such an event from occurring.
My public challenge to leading universities'
economists, was that they had all acted like "quackademics" in this matter
at that time. My persistence in presenting this challenge, led to my debate
with the leading Keynesian associated with the European "Congress for
Cultural Freedom," Professor Abba Lerner, a close associate with the
Professor Sidney Hook of the proudly evil Congress for Cultural Freedom(CCF).
The debate occurred at Queens College, on December 2, 1971.
The leading features of that debate are relevant for reporting here,
Professor Lerner lost the debate when he
stated, that "if the German social-democrats had accepted the policies
of the Bank of England's agent Hjalmar Schacht," who was also Hitler's
backer and leading Nazi official of the 1930s. "Hitler would not have
been necessary." As those words dropped from Abba Lerner's mouth, a
dull, grey thud could be seen, from where I sat at the podium, spreading
across the academic and other faces arrayed within the audience.
Lerner, once cornered by me during that
prolonged debate, had been smoked out, and had, thus, blurted out that
confession of his own true nature, as a virtual child of that head of
the Bank of England, and Hjalmar Schacht's protégé, Montagu Norman, who
had brought Hitler and Schacht to power in Nazi Germany, With those
words dropped from Professor Lerner's lips, silence intervened, to
conclude the day's proceedings, quietly, at that moment.
Decades later, in 1992, from the platform of my
campaign for the Democratic Party's Presidential nomination at that time, I
forecast an "economic-financial mudslide" as already ongoing. That was the
"mudslide," which was already ongoing, at that time, which carried my avowed
personal enemy, the then-U.S. President George H.W. Bush, out of the White
House, in the 1992 election.
Four years later, in January 1996, I presented my now famous "Triple Curve,"
depicting the nature of that trend whose effects, as the sudden deep
recession which erupted during Spring 2000, carried Presidential candidate
Albert Gore to an essentially self-inflicted defeat that same year. Gore's
petulant, childish behavior, contributed significantly to the international
monetary-financial-economic crisis, already then ongoing, which was to
become, later, the greatest, deflationary, 2007-2009, economic-financial
collapse (and also, in scale, hyper-inflationary monetary surge) in modern
history.
That deflation of the financial economy came on
under conditions of a skyrocketing monetary hyperinflation of the fictitious
economy, exactly in the fashion against which my "Triple Curve" and its up-datings
had forewarned, since the launching of my campaign for the Democratic
Presidential nomination in January 1996.
Later in that process, in a July 25, 2007, international webcast, I warned,
uniquely at that time, that the world was, at that moment, on the edge of a
something far worse than a "mere" economic depression: a general
breakdown-crisis, a breakdown crisis which actually began three days later,
and which has swept the entire world into a presently accelerating collapse
of the world economy as a whole. The refusal by the U.S. Congress and
Presidency, under both Presidents Bush and Obama, to acknowledge that
reality, has carried the entire planet, so far, chain-reaction style, to the
present, globally spreading general physical-economic breakdown.
Now, at the present moment this report is written, that process of an
ongoing general breakdown-crisis, is now carrying the entire world economy
near to the brink of a general, physical, chain-reaction form of physical
breakdown-crisis of all of the nations of the planet, a fact which gives
little to no presently visible hope for all humanity, under a continuation
of the present policies of leading governments, during the immediate
generations just ahead.
Without a sweeping reform, effected through a
shift out of the presently, hopelessly bankrupt world monetary system, to a
U.S. Constitutional form of credit-system, the entire planet is now on the
verge of a general, chain-reaction-like process of a general physical
breakdown of every economy throughout the world, and plunge of the level of
population, from the present level of about 6.7 billions persons, to a
prospect of probably two billions, or less, over the one or two generations
just ahead.76
There have been many contributing causes for the consistent incompetence of
the recent forecasts of every government of the world presently, but the
chief among those causes has been the general reliance on the sometimes
mathematically complicated, but consistently wrong, and stupidly so, set of
so-called statistical methods of monetarist forecasting employed.
Every use of a statistical method of composition
of a so-called "time-line," has been the principal source of that outpouring
of an out-rightly wasted previously existing wealth, this coming on as an
expression of virtually suicidal stupidity among what appears, presently, to
be most of the present governments of nearly every national economy of (with
special consideration for Italy as a quasi-exception) of Europe, and most of
the Americas, as also, of course, the traditional victims of modern British
imperialism in Africa.
This prevalent incompetence of my putative professional rivals among
economists and government officials, and the effect of their policy-shaping
influences on nations from virtually every part of the world, has much to do
with the fact that we have reached a phase of an actually 1968-2009 process
of what is called globalization, 77 during which the effects of
that virtual new Tower of Babel called globalization, has, itself,
produced a global situation in which the immediate near-certainty of a
looming Autumn 2009 general breakdown-crisis of the U.S. physical economy,
which would be virtually inevitable under any continuation, now, of the
present policies of the present U.S. Obama Presidency. Such a U.S. failure
of performance, would, also inevitably, set off a global chain-reaction
collapse of intermeshed monetary-financial systems, which would bring down
the economy of every national element of the world system into a physical
breakdown-crisis in the manner of a global, chain-reaction effect.
It would be a collapse for which no remedy, even
a significant amelioration of the effect, would be possible within the
axiomatic features of the present world monetary system, such as Joseph
Stiglitzs reported proposal to turn the International Monetary Fund into
what would be, in effect, the bad bank of the entire world, a suggestion,
by him, which is symptomatic of all those foolish economists, even leading
ones, who are seeking to introduce some reformed version of that Keynesian
system which has, in fact, been the disease at the root of the presently
onrushing, global, physical breakdown-crisis of the entire planet This would
be a crisis to hit with increasing brute force, as early as this now
onrushing set of events to unfold during the presently oncoming Autumn and
Winter seasons.
"Globalization," better identified as the efforts, led by the post-1946
British empire, to destroy the sovereignty of every nation of the world,
that by methods suggesting the erection of an imperial, global "Tower of
Babel," which has been designed by such as the evil Tony Blair government of
Britain, to destroy the sovereignty of every nation of the world.
This is being carried out now through the
practice of forcing each nation to give up its control over production of
the great majority of what it consumes, to depending upon imports from other
nations. , through exports and imports conducted for the great middle-man
the reigning world government owned by a new world-government under a
globaliation monetarist version of the British Empire. The monetarist and
financial middle men of the process of globalization, have been eating
the people of what had been once sovereign nations, in this fashion. This
makes every nation a captive of the international middle man of world
government the monetarist interests which control production, prices, and
trade in this proposed New Tower of Babel.
The post-1968-1973 International Monetary Fund (IMF)
has been turned into the vehicle through which this form of world
dictatorship of the British empire has been brought to the presently
disastrous state of world affairs in which economist Joseph Siglitz is
reported, as I have said just above, as proposing to turn the IMF into the
imperial bad bank reigning over the entire planet.
For this onrushing world-wide breakdown-crisis, there is only one remedy:
Put the national financial-monetary systems
of the nations of the world into a Glass-Steagall-modeled form of
liquidation of the present world monetary systems, through emergency
reorganization, to replace them, through reorganization-in-bankruptcy,
into a global form of fixed-exchange-rate credit system, a system
modeled on the role of Alexander Hamilton in creating what the U.S.
Federal Constitution as a credit-system freed of the intrinsic evils of
any form of the implicitly imperialist monetary systems.
Since that would end the present imperialist
tyranny of the financier class associated with the world's present
monetary system, the financier bloodsuckers of the world do not wish to
consider my proposed remedies, as a solution for the evils done by the
special interests which are the worse-than-useless-parasites such as
themselves.
We have witnessed the implicit criminality
of such cases, such as under the former U.S. George W. Bush, Jr.
administration, and that of his emotionally highly disturbed suck-sessor,
and, for at least a moment, or so, British imperial asset, the President
Barack Obama whose personal political reputation is now headed toward
the sewer, or lower, unless some kindly persons join me in placing him
under protective management inside, if needed, the well-padded interior
of the Oval orifice.
The most urgently needed change from the
present, Keynesian-like model of a monetary system, to a credit-system
modeled on the relevant provisions of that U.S. Federal Constitution, rests
upon that principle of the credit-system which has been the root and branch
of the U.S. Federal Constitutional system, from the beginning.
The intent of that Constitution has been,
notably, betrayed by the implicitly treasonous establishment of the
presently, virtually super-bankrupt, Federal Reserve system, that in favor
of the British-directed, Keynesian form of of the presently reigning, and
utterly bankrupt, imperial world monetary system.78 This
launching of the Federal Reserve System was effected through two Presidents
of the United States, two truly, treasonously inclined biological and
ideological sons of the British-created Confederate States of America,
Theodore Roosevelt and that Ku Klux Klan fanatic, Woodrow Wilson, who
relaunched the Klan on a grander scale than ever before, from the
Presidential wing of what had been renamed "the White House" by that nephew
and protégé his treasonous uncle and British agent James Bulloch.
At the present time, it can be suggested, if a bit cautiously, that the
Federal Reserve system is apparently bankrupt. The only need for such a
cautious qualification by me, is the fact that the habit of the U.S.
government has become to treat the Fed as it were an part of the
constitutional system of government, which, in the final analysis, it is
not; however, there has been a series of U.S. Presidencies which has treated
the Fed as if it were a constitutional institution, in their practice.
Otherwise, were any President and Congress to
treat the Federal Reserve Act, now, for what it really was, and actually is,
we shall absorb it as a well-defined bankrupt under the custody of the U.S.
Presidency, with the constitutional precaution of placing it under the care
and management-in-bankruptcy of a Third National Bank of the United States.
That arrangement will defend a salvaging process, which will aid the U.S.
Congress and Presidency in the much-needed process of carrying away the
relevant financial trash.
Actually, those among us who know the economic history of our United States,
know that we never actually needed the existence of Wall Street, which, in
any case, is now foredoomed to crash sometime after September 1, 2009,
perhaps after the next close of the U.S. fiscal year, in October, or some
desperate, intrinsically fraudulent stalling-tactic which makes everything
that much worse, a bit later.79
If we are intelligent, as well as patriotic, the
funeral services for those dead Fed assets which have been taken in since
September 2007, will be treated, summarily, as parting courtesies performed,
by Glass-Steagall standards, at some Wall Street grave-site under the dusk
of eventide, the interment of a departed and popularly despised thief, in as
respectful a manner as a greatly injured nation could tolerate for such an
occasion.
We have already reached, and, in fact, passed the point at which a return to
the patriotic perspectives of President Franklin Roosevelt is needed.
"Return to FDR's policies" must be qualified. Roosevelt died on April 12,
1945; we are now approaching the close of 2009. The world has changed in
many ways since 1945, and I speak here as one who has lived a presently very
active, and unusually well-informed adult, through all of this span.
It has changed much for the worse in the U.S.A., especially with the ugly
specter of a President Nixon crooning hypocritically over the outcome of the
famous Moon landing of the astronauts then. This change from Roosevelt and
Kennedy to Nixon had been brought about, forcibly, and radically, since
earlier beginnings of that decline, with the sudden inauguration of
President Truman. With the passage of successive generations, good
principles, such as those of the original U.S. Federal Constitution,
persist, as the true history of the Franklin Roosevelt administration
attests, but the conditions for their implication are often changed.
The Moon landing, over which President Nixon presided. was an accomplishment
which had been set into motion by the decision of that murdered President
John F. Kennedy, who had been Nixon's bitter 1960 rival for the Presidency.
The thought of Nixon watching evidence of the Moon landing, evoked an eerie
shudder, at that time, from a citizen who cared about our nation's
futureme.
So, with the passage of time, even over a span as brief, when view on an
historical scale, as nearly forty-six years since the death of the man we
recall as FDR, and, now sixty-four years since the totally unnecessary
nuclear bombing of civilian targets in an already, in fact, defeated Japan,80
and the disastrous effects on the United States of that Kennedy
assassination which cleared the way for the momentous hoax of the Gulf of
Tonkin resolution, forty-five years ago, I have experienced the crucial
changes within the course of world history since April 12, 1945, mostly for
the worse, but sometimes for the better. Between the death of Franklin
Roosevelt and now, the Moon landing was among "the better."
Now, with ten nations which have already have announced, so far, their
commitment to the development of the Moon as a launching-point into space
exploration, the history of the always changing world has come to a point,
at which the future destination humanity on Earth now depends upon the
launching of a process of high-priority development which establishes that
"industrial" development, on the Moon, which is indispensable for the
development of a comparable process on the planet Mars.
There is, obviously, a difference between simply saying, we must go to Mars,
and actually getting there. "Getting there," if we actually mean to
accomplish what we have stated that we intend to do, involves the challenge
of physically relativistic modes of transport between Moon-orbit and
Marsand return. With the world now on the verge of a general, vastly
genocidal collapse into a global new dark age, the situation here on Earth
today, our present political-economic system has reached a point of moral
and physical-economic decay, in which humanity is in danger of losing that
remaining opportunity of Mars development, even forever.
Therefore, the moment of victory for the future of humanity confronts us
now, in our choices between what we do, and what we do not efficiently
commit ourselves, as a planet, to accomplish. That choice will be made now,
or, possibly, not at all, made now in the midst of that presently onrushing,
greatest existential crisis for humanity which is presently known to us, in
our reflections of all presently known experience of previous history.
Consider the most crucial among the relevant
points of that history.
Real History, From The
Top, Down
A competent science of economy starts with the history of concepts of
principle, first, and proceeds from that primary standpoint, to comparing
conceptual history with the quantitative relations associated with those
qualitative conceptions. In the field of the mathematics of economy, these
institutions and relationships must be viewed in that categorical order.
Therefore, in a real conception of economy, the primary relations
considered, are, as I have crafted this present report, qualitative, not
quantitative. In the utterly incompetent, but, unfortunately, prevalent
practice of economic policy-shaping of our republic, today, it is the
quantitative measurements made in terms of measurement of the purely
fictional, and dangerously misleading conceptions of categories of economic
functions, which have predominated, and which, therefore, have been chiefly
responsible for the mess which most leading nations of he world have made of
the policy-shaping of the world economy today.
Essentially, the root of this problem is, that the reigning social classes
among the existing cultures in what is actually known as history, rather
than as mere chronicles of events, have treated the generality of a
population essentially as a form of cattle, herded and culled, as under the
proposed death-care policies of Adolf Hitler, Britains Tony Blair, and
the current, stubbornly held proposed policies of U.S. President Obama,
policies, for the satisfaction of what British monetarist doctrine defines
as it preferred reigning body of authority in society, world-wide.
Thus, the preferred categories heretofore used for the practice of
economics, or otherwise, heretofore, have no desirable sort of direct
bearing on the long-wave rates of increase of the potential relative
population-density of a culture, or among human cultures. National cultures
proceed like madmen banging their heads against the walls, in lurching from
from half-baked system to yet another, in a ricocheting succession of what
had been one usually lame-brained variation on expressions of an essentially
global monetarist system, miraculously avoiding the simple fact that it is
the idea of a monetarist system which has been the chief cause of the
pin-ball-game likeness of many among the tragic aspects of known world
history since the ancient Peloponnesian War.
The point which I have just made is no exaggeration. None of my putative
rivals in putatively professional economic forecasting since the time of my
relatively short-tem forecast of the relatively deep 1957 U.S. recession,
has even made a single, competent forecast of a generalized crisis in the
economies of the Americas or Europe.
There have been some good proposals with the effect of being a certain kind
of forecasts, as best typified by the patterns of policy-shaping associated
with President Charles de Gaulle in France and Konrad Adenauer in Germany,
or President Kennedys forecast of a manned Moon Landing; but, the actual
pathogen responsible for serious economic crises in Trans-Atlantic
cultures, has never been expressed in any relevant forecast which might have
been a known rival to my own, throughout the entire 1956-2009 interval to
date. Put aside some interesting thoughts among some circles in Italy today,
and all currently leading views of economy, from the Atlantic Ocean to the
Carpathians, remain today a proven existential disaster for civilization at
large.
Reforms in economic policies which have been made since the death of
President Roosevets, in the U.S.A. and Europe, most notably, have not been
competent, but more in the semblance of changing an infants diapers, which
treats an unpleasant effect without changing the source of the recurring
problem.
Think of yourself as having rights limited to those converging upon the
upper and lower limits of those afforded to a cow, as by President Obamas
Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel and related behaviorists, and you begin to recognize
how the City of London, or Wall Street under the proposed health-care and
general economic policy of Tony Blair or the Obama Presidency, in its
manifest practice, actually regards you as their chosen target for
a
culling of the human herd, a policy-outlook which was supplied to
Hitler Germany from the provinces of the British monarchy and the Montagu
Norman of Hjalmar Schachts time, an intention which is categorically, if
not in each detail, is a carbon-copy of the policy of euthanasia launched
by Adolf Hitler in September-October 1939.
That is to point out, and that most
emphatically, to a policy of genocide which had been conceived, earlier, by
the then, still, pro-Nazi British monarchy which had brought Hitler and his
regime to power in Germany with the assistance of the grandfather of U.S.
President George W. Bush, Jr.
You have seen this same pattern reenacted, in
the United States, for example, in the behavior of the Federal government
and its associated leadership of the U.S. Congress, since the close of
August 2007, as by those depraved figures cast in the likenesses of the
Senator Chris Dodd and the Representative Barney Frank, who have brought
down upon themselves the richly expressed pure, but still controlled hatred
shown by representatives of the majority of the citizenry of the United
States, during the month of August 2009, and, now, beyond.
The gentlemen and ladies which turn, repeatedly, to such varieties of
periodic cullings of the human herd, are usually regarded, of course, as
being highly respectable, if only among such as themselves and like those
lackeys sharing the propensity for kissing their esteemed masters butts,
whose habitual such notions of respectability obscures their vision of the
future consequences of such behavior.
So, the majority of the citizens of our United States have awakened lately
to express, loudly, their break from any willingness to consider the current
President and his cronies in health-care and related policies, as being the
kind of human beings with which they wish to be willingly associated. So,
most present members of the U.S. Congress are viewed currently in a similar,
and related way.
Any member of the U.S. Congress who wishes to
remain a member of that Congress, or be simply regarded as an honorable
person, will now seek to prove that he or she has nothing in common with
what have been, to present date, the present health-care and economic
policies of the Obama administration, or with those members of the Congress
who are in the following of such creatures as the notorious Speaker of the
House, the most dispensable Representative Nancy Pelosi for whom no
political face-lift now seems feasible.
Until these most unpleasant developments since August 2007, and the worse
behavior of the Administration of President Barack Obama since his
health-care and economic teams were installed, the traditional presumption
of good faith among the majority of our citizenry was the assumption, that
as Scotland's bard Robert Burns once put the point, "for all that," the
Congress as a body had been seen as dedicated to a satisfactory outcome for
the benefit of the general welfare of citizens as human beings distinct from
animals, that assumed to be the case whatever blunders, and misbehavior the
body of the Congress might condone, as from time to time.
That changed, suddenly, as the U.S. Congress
went into its August recess.
On The Method of the
"Triple Curve"
The intent to introduce what has become widely known among leading
economists as my "Triple Curve," was prompted by my participation in a 1995
Vatican conference on health-care policies.
I sketched out the principles of this
pedagogical device in a memorandum given to the relevant institution, at the
conclusion of that event, but did not present it publicly, otherwise. as I
have already noted above, until my presentation of it as the thematic
feature of my formal announcement of the launching of my 1996 campaign for
the Democratic Party's Presidential nomination.
I defined that pedagogical device in terms of three principal parameters:
the monetary process; the financial process; and, the process of the
physical economy measured per capita and per square kilometer. The emphasis
of this pedagogical design was placed on the matter of relative directions
of changes in relationships among these three subjects.
As was emphasized by an updated version of this
pedagogical illustration, presented in the August 1, 2009 LPAC webcast,
where the relatively recent development in the economy is portrayed as the
fact of a post-September 2007, qualitative. shift in the direction of these
three elements, between a continued, and actually accelerating rate of
skyrocketing of a hyperinflationary monetary expansion, relatively, first of
all, an accelerating collapse of the financial level, and, secondly, an
accelerating collapse of the physical and related output of employment of
and productive output of the labor-force.
These three directions in economy, not only in
the U.S. economy, but world-wide, suffice to define the existence of a
presently ongoing general breakdown-crisis, one which is collapsing in every
part of the world economy, if at somewhat differing local rates in each and
all sections of the world economy. This has been in accelerating progress
since July-September 2007, while nothing of any palpable effectiveness has
been done, in the known case of any government, or supranational institution
of the world, to stop it.
Obviously, not only has neither the U.S. government, nor any government of
western and central Europe, nor the nations of Central and South America,
take even the meanest palpable steps, to do anything about this combined
hyperinflationary-deflationary, breakdown-crisis, but each and all have
refused even to admit that this greatest hyper-inflationary breakdown-crisis
in all known world history, a breakdown-crisis against which I, widely known
for what have been, repeatedly, in fact, for which I have supplied repeated,
consistent, and widely circulated updates, in the form of systematic,
empirically detailed, published warnings of the worsening of a global trend
in this direction, over four decades, even exists: although my repeated
warnings have been circulated more or less world-wide, among leading
economists of the world, that since my celebrated defeat of Professor Abba
Lerner in the featured, New York City debate of December 2, 1971.
In assessing this case, we are impelled, and rightly so, to compare this
present, world-wide crisis, with the hyperinflationary crisis imposed
willfully upon post-World War I Germany, by the British Empire and its
culpable allies, at Versailles. Yet, in making this comparison, we also
preface this treatment with emphasis on the fact, that while this pattern of
monetary hyperinflation and physical-economic collapse, has been shown, most
clearly, to have become a clear count-down toward global doom, since the
monstrous mis-conduct. jointly, by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, French
President Francois Mitterrand, and U.S. President George H.W. Bush, in the
matter of Germanys reunification.
The 1923 breakdown-crisis in Germany, was, principally, an exceptional
product of the British and French determination to destroy any further
resistance to the British empires reign over continental Europe, what the
so-called Versailles powers brought upon 1923 Germany corresponds, in
essential, lawfully systemic economic features of its dynamic design, to
what is being done by the effects of post-Westphalian globalization on the
entirety of the planet now.
With the imposition of the Euro on western and
central Europe, and since the lunacy of the U.S. President George W. Bush,
Jr., what has faced us, as presently, is not only the fully lawful process
of a destruction of the nations of all of the world's mankind right now.
but, now, a wildly insane refusal to admit the problem exists, in a time
when the entire world's present monetary system is already disintegrating
before the eyes of all nation's governments.
My relevant opponents, including those in highly placed positions of
government, are now about as flagrantly wrong as any misguided government in
known world history had ever become! So, in such fashion, have great empires
been wiped from the map in times past.
Fortunately, for the people of these nations, there are remedies for this
onrushing threat of an already onrushing, total, world-wide collapse, even at
this late time. The crucial issue, now, is posed by the simple question to
the leading political forces among nations: "Do relevant leading nations of
the world have the good sense, to adopt the reforms which I set before them,
finally, now, a "about two minutes before their common doom?" If, not, then
anything resembling civilization, is about to depart this planet for a
rather long time to come.
If the nations of Europe have shown no signs of willingness to recognize the
actual present situation, perhaps on grounds of sovereign claims of
impotence, the question may be otherwise stated for the case of the U.S.
government: Is President Obama ready to accept the public proposal I have
proffered to him for the rescue of his shattered administration, or, will
his stubborn resistance to that reform, condemn the people of the nations of
this planet, to a prolonged new dark age, during which it were likely that
the present level of world population would collapse rapidly, through famine
and epidemic, from a presently estimatable 6.7 billions, to two, or less?
As this time of a deepening and accelerating onset of a world-wide,
chain-reaction-style, breakdown-crisis of the entire system.
The lawful outbreak of a mass-strike by the
majority of the U.S. electorate, against both the Obama Presidency and also
the U.S. Congress, represents a mass-strike comparable to that which brought
down the tough, stubborn regime of the DDR and also the Soviet Union, too.
This is a breakdown-process, already at full tilt, which, if allowed to
continue, without needed reversals of the current policies of most nations
of the world, would strike all of the nations of the world, beginning with
the global chain-reaction effects of a sudden, steep devaluation of that
mass of U.S. dollar-denominated debt, on which the existence of every part
of the world depends for its stability today.
Admittedly, I am not popular with many leading circles in the world, who
are, perhaps, offended that I exhibit so little respect for their current
policy-shaping.. For reasons which should be obvious, I am rather proud of
that curious achievement, since what they show themselves as believing is
that terribly wrong opinion which is symptomatically, the sign of the doom
of those clinging desperately to lost dreams of past glories that never
really existed in any durable way. This world is our world as the creation
of the U.S. Federal Constitution set forth the needed principles of
government in the world, if, as has been said by one of our greatest
leaders, Benjamin Franklin, if we of the United States itself, "can keep
it."
What is required, respecting the view of these matters from the
vantage-point of the "Triple Curve," is the recognition that, as I have
stated, repeatedly, in this report thus far, the most crucial of the needed
changes from the terribly failed present world policy, centers on the
sweeping elimination of the existence of monetary systems from any large
region of this planet.
The good side of the present crisis, is the fact
that the world's monetary system is hopelessly doomed during the onrushing
future. The issue posed by that fact of the present global situation, is
whether or not nations are prepared to adopt the essentially elementary
changes required to launch a general recovery of both our United States and
the world at large from the presently looming greatest cultural disaster in
all of the known political and social history of mankind.
The only way in which the existing nations of the world can be prevented
from falling, jointly, at this moment, into a prolonged, chain-reaction form
of "new dark age" throughout the planet, is to uproot, hopefully forever,
all traces of what is intrinsically an imperialist system, otherwise known
as a monetary system, from among the leading nations of the world.
Cancel
all dubious monetary debts; use the Franklin Roosevelt precedent of the
Glass-Steagall standard for reorganization of a financial system in
bankruptcy, as the entire world is bankrupt presently, and establish a
fixed-exchange-rate, anti-Keynesian system of the type which President
Franklin Roosevelt had intended, had his death not brought the U.S.
Presidency into the paws of a Winston Churchill admirer, and pro-Keynesian
President Harry S Truman.
If any nation wishes to survive, words are not sufficient. They must act to
prove that they are qualified to survive, by ridding this planet, now, of
the intrinsically imperialist evil of intrinsically predatory monetary
systems.
This brings us, considering what has been presented by me in this report up
to this point, to the technical crux of the entire matter as it is presented
to the world as a whole today.
Science - The Most
Crucial Issue of Them All
To set the stage, so to speak, for the topic which will now command our
attention, between now and the epilogue of the report as a whole:
As I have emphasized repeatedly in this report, by late July 2007, the world
as a whole had already entered the state of a general bankruptcy of the
economic systems of the planet as a whole. I had announced the imminence of
this critical change in my July 27, 2007 international webcast. .
It came three days later. when an already creaking financial dam broke. The
world system as a whole had been spun into the beginning of a general
bankruptcy which has been spreading, as a chain-reaction-style collapse
throughout the planet, since that time.
True, the U.S. dollar had no longer controlled the policy of the world,
since the British interest took over, increasingly, since the early 1970s.
However, as the present case of China merely
illustrates the point, it is still the U.S. dollar-denominated credit which
supplies, either directly, or indirectly, the greatest single margin of the
international financing of the leading edge of the worlds economy as a
whole, a margin on which all nations depend; so, the dollar still reigns in
one way through its use, but only in manner of that slave upon which his
slothful (British imperial) master depends for doing whatever must be done.
We are, thus, momentarily, ostensibly trapped in the process of going over
from a long post-1968 down-slide of the once-mighty U.S. dollar, into its
presently onrushing systemic collapse, which could happen at almost any time
this Autumn, unless we act now, to prevent this, would set off an almost
immediate, global chain-reaction of collapse, which be sufficient as a
detonator, to shut down, suddenly, virtually, every other nation of what is
already a terribly crisis-wracked world financial system as a whole.
As I have also emphasized repeatedly since a time as early as the beginning
of September 2007, my initially projected proposal for emergency reform
through reorganization in lawful bankruptcy, was expressed in the design for
my proposed, immediate U.S. Federal action in the form of what I had named a
Homeowners and Bank Protection Act of 2007 (HBPA).
This proposed legislation, which quickly gained
widespread electoral support throughout the U.S.A., was, unfortunately,
prevented from being installed, by leading actions launched, initially,
through two members of the U.S. Congress, Senator Chris Dodd (Conn.) and
U.S. Representative Barney Frank (Mass.). In their part in the wrecking of
the U.S. economy, that pair proceeded, with the backing for such ruinous
policies by the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi
(CA).
At the time I presented the notion of the Homeowners and Bank Protection Act
(HBPA), in my webcast address of July 27, 2007, the return of the U.S.
Federal government to application of the standard defined by the Glass-Steagall
Act (under U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt), would have been sufficient
to enable my proposal to prevent foreclosures of homeowners, thus averting
the effects of a social crisis, and, also, to keep essential, regularly
chartered U.S. banks functioning, even if some of them would require support
in this role through a process of reorganization in bankruptcy.
That was still a hoped-for prospect at the time of the inauguration of a
newly elected U.S. President, Barack Obama, in January 2009. However, that
changed abruptly, at time of the newly sworn new President's visit with the
British Queen in London. It was now clear, especially with the evil Tony
Blair lurking in the background, that the Federal government of the U.S.A.
was not really in American hands at that time.81
Thereafter, it was soon shown that the new President was not what he had
been generally pretended to be, or perceived as being, as during the time
between his election and inauguration. He showed himself to be, in effect, a
British agent close to the evil, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair;
and, it was also evident that President Obama had adopted a British
health-care policy of Blairs (NICE), one which incorporated all among the
essentials of the infamous September-October 1939 Adolf Hitler program of
killing lives deemed not worthy to be lived.
This evidence defined the urgent need for my
April 11 2009 international webcast, in which I presented a new outlook on
our republic's current strategic situation.
Under the kind of economic policy which accompanied President Obama's
promotion of a copy of the Adolf Hitler-copied, 1939 program for health
care, combined with a tens of trillions of dollars of "bail out" of those
banks which should be been put, legally, through reorganization in
bankruptcy according to a revived Glass-Steagall standard, there was no
prospect for what would have been, otherwise accomplished merely through the
success of a relatively simple reorganization in bankruptcy of the type
expressed by my Homeowners and Bank Protection Act of 2007. That reform
would have worked, in itself; but, there was an additional development which
must be addressed.,
I presented the most crucial evidence of this new situation during an April
11, 2009 international webcast. In that webcast, I identified, point by
point, the essential facts concerning the menacing combination of a
President suffering the kind of "Narcissus complex" typified for historians
by the case of the Roman Emperor Nero, exposing, then, the murderous
intention of the set of those among those of the President's British-style
"behaviorist" advisors who were committed to support a health-care policy
copied from the 1939 Adolf Hitler-style program for health-care.
The political problem represented by the Hitler-copied program repeatedly
proposed by President Obama featuring Obama's health-care program since that
time, is juxtaposed with another major problem, the vast bail-out which the
Democratic Party had backed, as its continuation of the great swindle of
looting the U.S. nation for the benefit of banks which had taken the banking
system outside the President Franklin Roosevelt, Glass-Steagall standards
for regular banking, a change from Glass-Steagall which allowed the mixing
of the operations of major commercial banks which had been formerly
operating by Glass-Steagall standards of credibility, with the highly
corrupt, financial-derivatives-polluted trash uttered, most notably, by Wall
Street and London financial-speculators' community.
In light of the fact, the entire world financial community, especially North
America and Europe, had to be considered as now hopelessly rotten to the
core financially. With its skyrocketing, already hyper-inflationary mass of
worthless speculative paper, there is no possibility, now, of preventing any
part of a world financial system which has significant ties to the North
American and European financial-monetary systems, from falling into a
breakdown form of chain-reaction collapse throughout the planet.
Almost at
the very moment that the U.S.A. itself becomes officially a victim of not
merely a general state of bankruptcy of the individual member-states of the
U.S.A., there would be a general, chain-reaction mode of breakdown of the
society of the entire planet, a breakdown brought about through a plunge of
the planet, chain-reaction style, into a greater catastrophe, this time on a
global scale, than the Fourteenth-century "new dark age," which wiped out
approximately one third of the population of Europe.
The crucial point to be made, is shown most efficiently by the pedagogical
model of an updated version of my Tripe-Curve pedagogy.
Since July-August 2007, while the physical
output of the economy has continued to fall at an accelerated rate, an
onrushing financial depression in financial output, as presently in
progress, has been contrasted with the actuality of a soaring
hyper-inflationary rate of in monetary inflation, thus creating a
simultaneous hyper-inflationary/deflationary stress in the ratio of monetary
to financial aggregate, that at the same time that physical output of the
economy is declining still now, at an accelerating rate.
These are, precisely, the appropriate symptoms
of an onrushing collapse of the entire economy of the planet, at for as long
as the present system of practice us continued. Only an immediate general
reorganization in bankruptcy, could save civilization from this now
impending, accelerating rate of global breakdown-crisis.
It is necessary to eliminate the monetary factor through
bankruptcy-reorganization conducted by government, while pouring in
long-term Federal credit for funding a recovery into urgently needed forms
of basic economic infrastructure, especially physical infrastructure, and
increased productive employment through Franklin Roosevelt-style pouring of
that Federal credit into investment in essential forms of basic economic
infrastructure and industries associated with the building and uses of that
infrastructure.
A Global Challenge
There is a specific remedy now absolutely required for this type of
breakdown-crisis. The key to that remedy is the reinstatement, by the U.S.A.
of the Glass-Steagall standard; otherwise the outcome will be a form of
chaos from which no recovery of the nation were to be presumed at this
time..
By restoring that standard, for the case of the U.S.A., and through aid of
coordinated agreements with Russia, China, and India, among other
cooperating nations, it were feasible to perform the virtually instantaneous
"miracle" of deriding all financial claims which do not meet the equivalent
of Glass-Steagall standards, and, thus, virtually ending the existence of
the presently hopelessly bankrupt monetary system, as that would be
accomplished through a process of constitutionally defined, U.S.
Constitutional reorganization of national accounts, as conducted in a
process of bankruptcy-reorganization.
As soon as continental western and central Europe break from the British
imperial "Euro" system, those nations, too, would be enabled to join that
reorganization of the world system with the U.S.A., Russia, China, India,
and others, in a change from a monetary system, to a world-wide network of
respectively sovereign, national credit-systems constituted as a global,
fixed exchange-rate credit system based on the uniquely successful model of
the prohibition against monetarism in the U.S. Federal Constitution.
The result of that combination of developments
would be a system, issuing new national credit-loans over a mean term of a
half-century (and wiping the vast mass of "bad," monetarist debt from the
books), for rapidly rebuilding the world economy through, chiefly,
initially, major ventures in construction of urgently needed basic economic,
public infrastructure among cooperating nations, freed from the evils of
globalization, to return to the practice of being once more truly sovereign
nation-state republics.
For those who know the U.S.A.s and related history in such matters, as I
do, there is no reasonable objection, on moral principle, to such a reform.
The difficulties of comprehension, especially in Europe and among other
nations trapped in the post-February 1763 legacy of British global imperial
monetarism, are chiefly products of the ignorance which has been promoted
even in the ranks of the presumably educated sections of the population,
rather than a fault in the stated proposals themselves...
It is those difficulties on which I have
concentrated here, in the remainder of my principal remarks here, today. The
key to the needed change from a hopelessly ruined monetary system, to the
global array of a fixed-exchange rate set of credit systems, is, as I shall
indicate here, a matter of science, not mere opinion, especially in light of
the peculiar character of the global crisis which confronts the largely mis-educated
world as a whole today.
This brings us to a crucial issue, which is not entirely a new issue in the
history of civilized society, but is an extremely urgent, immediate issue,
today. The remedy for this crisis, is to be underscored in the most relevant
way, by considering the present opportunities for launching the kind of a
program of fundamental scientific progress, which would lead our planet,
over the course of coming decades, through certain, urgently needed, great
reforms in principles of the world's economy as a whole.
These are reforms which represent the
development of the already foreseeable capability of using the emerging
capability for specifically relativistic movements in interplanetary travel,
technologies whose implementation are coming into reach now.
I shall refer to that in an appropriate way in my conclusion to the present
chapter of this report.
However, before getting to the heart of the matter of science in this
business, it is essential that we, first, clear away several, unfortunately,
deeply embedded, wrongful notions about monetary systems.
European Monetary
Systems
.The hitherto poorly understood root of the issue posed by the presently
onrushing general economic-breakdown-crisis of the planet as whole, is the
continuing effect on this planet generally, today, of the emergence of a
millennial-long, actually imperialist system of monetarist hegemony within
the maritime cultures and their offshoots of a "western" monetary system.
These have been a long-ranging development
during the interval between the effects which had emerged in the inter
between the effects of the defeat of the long-standing, ancient West Asian
empires' efforts to grab control of the eastern Mediterranean maritime
region, and in the subsequent conclusion of that transitional phase of world
history which occurred with the successive victories and, then, death of
Alexander the Great.82
Within the historical setting of those times, the Peloponnesian War had
divided what we call today that ancient Greek civilization which had been
united in victor over the Achaemenid imperial power. This internecine
warfare among those Greeks, defined what became the division of
maritime-centered power in the Mediterranean region, a division among the
Eastern maritime regions, Egypt, and Rome, a division which continued until
the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra by the alliance of Octavian with the
priesthood of the Asiatic cult of Mithra.
This division of the Mediterranean system was
resolved, in a manner of speaking, by the negotiations between Julius
Caesar's heir, Octavian (Caesar Augustus) with the priesthood of the cult of
Mithra, through those negotiations conducted on the Isle of Capri which
consolidated these three regions of Asia, Africa, and Italy, in a single
Roman Empire.
From that point on, all principal forms of European cultures, despite the
fact that empires and dynasties have changed in many secondary or tertiary
ways, the colonial or semi-colonial subjects of what has become the form of
the reigning imperial monetary system of today, have been under a continuing
form of imperial rule known as a millennial-long-ranging succession of
monetary systems, from that ancient time, to the present day..
The Mediterranean (later, European) form of monetary systems, had deep roots
in Asia, as illustrated by the case of the monetarist activities operating
out of the center of the cult of Delphi, which continued to exert a very
significant role in European imperial systems, as over imperial Rome,
through the lifetime of that notorious liar and high priest of Delpi,
Plutarch.
Indeed, it was from such circles, that the three
regions of monetarist maritime interest, Athens, Corinth, and Syracuse,
suffered notable ruin in being played against one another by traditionally
Asia-related interests associated with Tyre, and beyond, through and beyond
the time of the Peloponnesian War.
That development had been an experience with the same practice of
divide-and-reign which was to be employed in modern times by the British
East India Company interests in their orchestrating the "Seven Years War,"
and by the British, again, in ruining the U.S.A. through luring foolish
Presidents and Congresses, into wars which wasted he U.S.A. to the advantage
of the British empire, as in Indo-China of the late 1960s and early 1970s,
or, more recently, Blair's lies which led into the trap in Iraq. Such was
done by then British Prime Minister Tony Blair's role as a global liar and
unspeakable scoundrel, in orchestrating the long, wasting U.S. Iraq war
under the foolish President George W. Bush, Jr.
That same, seemingly eternally odious Mr. Blair has played a role in leading
the foolish U.S. into the British Afghanistan trap, under the recklessly
opportunist quasi-Nero, which has been our President Barack Obama. The
British imperial practice has become the permanent ulcer of the wars run,
not by those pathetic dupes known as Jews or Arabs, but by the British who
control them both as mere puppets of a game like fox-and-hounds, top-down,
in the Sykes-Picot regional cockpit called the Middle East.
It is the British empire still today, which play
Jews and Arabs like puppets on strings, in killing one another, like
puppets, for amusements presented on a British Foreign Office's bloody
geo-theatrical stage. The play the game like gladiators trained and assigned
to kill and be killed in the imperial Roman arena. The gladiators do this to
defend themselves against the other victims of the British imperialists who
orchestrate those games. If and when Jews and Arabs face the that truth, the
British reign over that region will cease, for lack of players foolish
enough to continue to play that perpetual, gladiatorial game.
To make our crucial point about modern monetarism clear, a bit of background
must be summarized.
The relevant point to be emphasized, for the purposes of the unifying
subject of this present report, is that these developments are to be read,
in retrospect, as the root of the subject immediately before us today, the
origins of a form of imperialist culture rooted in that essentially
monetarist type of maritime cultures, then centered in the Mediterranean, as
opposed to the monetarist form of the imperialist cultures typical of inland
Asia since the decadence of that colony of the Indian Ocean's specifically
maritime (cuneiform) culture which had been planted as the "hydraulic
culture" of cuneiform Sumer in southern Mesopotamia.
To understand the world in its entirety today, we must understand that all
leading European culture, as extended as a maritime culture and its
offshoots, has been a distinctly European culture since that late phase of
the most recent entry into a post-glacial period, until the present day, an
unfolding process which has had the essential internal characteristics of
behavior and belief as a specifically monetarist form of culture.
The most important development in the history of
that culture, so defined, has been the development of the United States of
America, as, predominantly, a European culture which was created to escape
the crippling effects of the still deeply rooted oligarchical tradition in
the nations of Europe themselves. Excepting for the corruption still pouring
into North America from, chiefly, the British oligarchical tradition itself,
we have succeeded very poorly, but, circumstances considered, remarkably
well.
That fact, points to the crux of the character of the currently onrushing,
present, global physical-economic breakdown-crisis of the present time.
That crisis has been, chiefly, the fruit of the
continuation of monetary systems rooted in mercantile forms of
money-interests rooted, in turn, in a global monetarist system composed of
private trade and usury accounts, an imperial system, still centered in
London, as the opponent of credit-systems based on the physical
wealth-creating powers of any actually sovereign nation.
British Imperialism's
Wars
So, throughout the entire period since about the time of the Peloponnesian
War of B.C. 431-404, first, Mediterranean, and, later, European cultures
have been dominated by Mediterranean types of monetary imperialist systems.
This includes the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the post-A.D. 1000
Venetian-centered system of feudal forms of monetary power, through the
Fourteenth-Century New Dark Age, and in the rise of Venetian monetarist
power which was the hand behind the Fall of Constantinople, and the same
hand in the launching of the religious warfare in the Europe of the
1492-1648 interval.
It was the same Venetian monetarist power, the
proverbially Venetian blinding effects, which ran the conversion of the
foolish and brutish Henry VIII of England into a piece of diseased rubbish,
a creature from the effects of whose assigned role Europe generally has not
fully recovered to the present day.
So, with the rise of the power of the Paolo Sarpi who controlled England's
James I, and who crafted the preparations for the launching the Thirty Years
War 1618-1648, the center of Venetian control of Europe through a
combination of Sarpi's Liberalism and Venetian financier power, had been
shifted to the Netherlands and England by the time of the installation of
King George I.
It was the orchestration of the "Seven Years War" of
1754-1763, a war orchestrated by the same British East India Company led
from the latter time onward, that the British Empire was established. It was
established, initially, as the empire of a Anglo-Dutch private company,
under the direction of Lord Shelburne; and, it was that Shelburne who
established the British Foreign Office as a tool of that Company in 1782
until the middle of the following century.
The method of "Seven Years" wars has been the
trade-style in the art of warfare of the British empire, from 1754 to the
present day, including two World Wars, the U.S.-Soviet conflict, and
virtually every other staged regional war. such as Iraqm Afghanistan, of the
Arab-Israeli blood-letting, or threatened major war on this planet, through
the recent U.S. Iraq War, the internationally orchestrated effects of
Israel-Arab conflicts, and the battle in Afghanistan now.
All empires in globally extended European history have always operated like
that, through strategies based on a conception of explicitly monetarist
interest, from the Peloponnesian War to the present day in Afghanistan. That
was the conflict between Corinth and Athens at the center of the first
general phase of the Peloponnesian War, and in the second phase, against
Syracuse.
This was the practice of Byzantium in its
orchestration of wars against Charlemagne. This was the practice of the
Venetians, who had superseded Byzantium at that time, in launching the
Normans, who had been created by Byzantium, against Charlemagne and his
successors, together with diversionary forces from Norway, in the Norman
conquest of England, thus accomplishing the first step in establishing
Venice, which had been a Mediterranean power, into the foundations of also
becoming an Atlantic power through the process of splitting Henry VIII's
England from formerly peaceful English relations with Spain and France, and
thus continuing the religious warfare of 1492-1648 throughout Europe.
In all of the most significant military and related conflict situations
orchestrated by that Empire, to the present moment in Afghanistan, such has
been the situation from which we must now free mankind.
The Anti-U.S.A.,
European Concept of Empire
Some very foolish nations and ignorant people have not written off what they
once misconceived to be an American Empire. The European concept of Empire,
as distinct from some Asian varieties, has always been a monetarist
conception. It has been, essentially, a system of monetarist interests,
united under what is either known as an emperor, as in the Habsburg or
British system, or as in the form of an emperor under another name.
In such a system of law, the Emperor is the only
agency which is authorized by what is infamously named international law, to
make actual laws superseding any notion of reasonable principle. This is why
virtually no nation of Europe as a principled constitution comparable to
that of the U.S.A. This was the notion of imperial law which was the issue
of theological strife between the Emperor Constantine and the Christians, a
conflict over the matter of the concept of Christianity pitted against the
inherently Roman-paganist imperial Pantheon.
Under such oligarchical law, the Emperor himself is the kind of
anti-constitutional "unitary" authority (e.g., dictator) which was mimicked
by Vice-President Dick Cheney in Cheney's use of his puppet, President
George W. Bush, Jr., and also of Speaker of a certain kind of House, Nancy
Pelosi, the same unitary principle which President Obama has continued as
this is expressed in the matter of his own present adoption-in-fact of
former Vice-President Cheney's unconstitutional, and plausibly criminal,
even treasonous, Guantanamo heritage.
Mere kings, Presidents, or the like, by contrast, have administrative
authority in law, but not the essentially pantheistic form of religious
"unitary" authority of an emperor, as such imperial presumptions had been
wrongfully codified as "international law" under European imperial
traditions of law since no later than ancient Rome.
It is to be stressed, once more, that the business of Europe, usually, has
been managing the military and economic power in such a way, that the
imperial power, or a likeness of imperialism such as the notion of "unitary"
authority which has been unlawfully adopted under Presidents George W. Bush,
Jr. and Obama, as in the Guantanamo case.
As in those cases of dictatorial "unitary"
tyranny (for tyranny it is, under historically traditional law); it is, as
in the cases of
George W. Bush, Jr.'s and Obama's governments to present
date, the international monetarist interest which reigns over, and against
both the general population and even the military power, as including such
relatively recent European cases as Mussolini and Hitler, up to the present
moment. This is not novel, since it is nothing other than a continuation of
the European monetarist tradition of imperial law over the past 2,500 years,
and longer, in Mediterranean tradition, as since Tyre and its offshoot
Carthage during the Seventh Century B.C., and later.
So, as my experience tells me, the poor, misguided suckers who often lead
the principal institutions of the U.S.A., work in the interest of the
British Empire today, as when their foolish, or worse predecessors joined on
the side of the British in World War I, or in the Indo-China War of
1968-1975, or two Iraq wars, or the present war in Afghanistan, or worrying
about the Arab-Israeli and other strife on imperial Britain's Middle East
Sykes-Picot stage.
Look at those pathetic official fools in in Washington who, after the
follies of Vietnam and Middle East wars, would attempt to teach us strategy
lately! At the present moment, that entire issue is, in a manner of
speaking, "McChrystal clear."
For example: U.S. Government leadership in taking constitutionally
appropriate, truthful action, in the present, global monetary-financial
breakdown-crisis, on its own initiative, would have forced all sane
governments of the world to, have taken comparable emergency actions, first,
and, in this way, brought forth the establishment of a relatively hegemonic
credit-rather-than-monetarist system, an international, fixed-exchange-rate
credit system.
This would be a system consistent with the
anti-monetarist principle at the foundation of the U.S. Federal
Constitution, a system of credit based on the conceptions of the U.S. first
Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton's intention to form what we would term
today the anti-Keynesian intention of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, prior
to his death in April 12, 1945.
The world now has no other sane choice available, but to adopt this reform
which I have present, or, else, give up hope of civilization anywhere,
during many decades still to come. It must be done, even to avoid the
ultimate vanishing, forever, of some presently existing nations and
cultures. Sometimes, the Creator presents mankind, as now, with choices
which no power of mankind could willfully resist.
I am not dictating these choices; I am merely
reporting them, not, perhaps as a Biblical Isaiah, but simply as my being,
on the current record of virtually, repeatedly, competence in forecasting,
the most competent economist currently available for such duties as this I
propose here: a relative advantage which many among my political and
academic rivals have already demonstrated, by exhibiting either their
ignorance, or simple pig-headedness.
One way or another, before the smoke has cleared on what is now coming down
upon all nations, we shall have either adopted the reforms I have
prescribed, or, at the best, most among those nations shall, in all
likelihood, have simply disappeared from the map, that result occurring
during some presently early part of that great dark age they will have
brought upon themselves, as they have done by their reluctance to make the
urgently needed change which I have already proposed here.
All of the worst among the truly existential crises of human cultures have
come upon an errant people and their leaders when, as it appears to some
among us, that the Creator's patience with the stupid people over several
generations, has gone beyond the limits of tolerance, as in a time when the
most cataclysmic kind of judgment as before a supernal throne, has struck
with punishment against the stubbornly errant likeness of such as most among
the governments of Europe, and certain other places, today.
Such a time of awesome judgment looms before all
that mankind which appear to be gathered on trialm as the accused, before
the throne of Heaven in the great global crisis ongoing just now. There are
scant few leading circles in the world who are not, each, culpable before
that throne, in one fashion or another, whether by intent, wanton
negligence, or merely simple indifference to those issues which determine
the fate of nations, or even all mankind.
The judgment of guilt to be put upon errant culture in such cases as the
present world situation, is in no way the work to be assigned to the
judgment some customarily capricious court. The failure to follow those
pathways of progress on which the implicitly embedded mission of mankind
depends, as the U.S. Declaration of Independence and Preamble of our Federal
Constitution defines that high principle of law, is already, in and of
itself, a crime against humanity in general, and therefore, implicitly,
against the Creator, too, and will, therefore, likely, come to enjoy its
rewards accordingly.
For example: there is no recourse in the form of right to democratic appeal
in such matters as that, such as the peddling of the use of so-called
"recreational substances," all on behalf of a devilishly degraded sophistry
in use of the term "freedom," by the accomplices of the evil
George Soros whom Hitler's regime had
trained, drugs whose effect, in use by oneself, or by others, impairs the
fulfillment of obligations to the continuity and progress of the condition
of mankind. If you frustrate the defense of progress, such as scientific
progress, in the condition of mankind, in any part of the world, you are
committing a categorical form of crime against the purpose of the existence
of mankind everywhere.
Suicide, or similarly destructive behavior, by whim,
or by cessation of "a life deemed unworthy to be lived, is a also crime
against all mankind.
If you deny that reasoning, you are personally disgusting, and that ends the
debate. Then, you are as guilty as any murderous sort of drunken driver, who
appeals after the fact "But, I did not intend that that should have
happened!it was an accident!" The prudent judge's rely to such an appeal,
might well be, "Are you suggesting that could not have happened, unless your
existence had happened. On whom, therefore, should be pass judgment, here,
today?" We must all be positively accountable; reckless negligence, or
simply moral indifference in respect to matter of principle, might prove to
be, after all, an essential form of crime.
What Leibniz identified, as stated in our U.S. Declaration of Independence,
as "the pursuit of happiness" is the constitutional principle of all
civilized nations, just as the Preamble of the U.S. Federal Constitution,
is, contrary to all unreconstructed Confederates of the British cause, the
truly governing, primary law set forth in our Federal Constitution.
Monetarism, for example, is a systemic form of crime against humanity. The
fact that monetarism has prevailed for so long, does not justify it as being
conventional, or traditional; rather, such evidence indicates that the
criminality of the effects of monetarism is a propensity for evil which has
remained a deeply inbred appetite for the legendary stuff of filthy lucre in
the character of the habitué.
When, then, is the nature of the alternative to that ancient evil practiced
as monetarism? Herein lies the essential point respecting what I have named
"The Triple Curve."
Eradicating Monetarism
It should have been obvious to any persons not "brainwashed" into accepting
monetarist practices as, perhaps, "traditional," that there is no causal, or
comparable sort of functional relationship of the sort which the
professionally competent laboratory associates with discovery of universal
physical principles of science, between the notion of price and a functional
definition of physical economic value.
Price in a monetary system, for example, as the British "behaviorists" such
as a Locke, an Adam Smith, and a Jeremy Bentham presume, is associated
either with what the buyer is willing to pay, or fear not to pay.
The observed behavior of such wretches as those
three and their likeness, tends, as the cases of Enron, or as the form of
reckless, usually thieving "financial derivatives," illustrate, is
predominantly, the propensity for evil: "I have a right to get money; if you
are not smart enough, and crooked enough to beat me at that game, it is just
your fault!
So, I stole your family's pension from General
Motors; what about it?. You lost because you were too dumb to pay attention
to the fact that I am an outright crook;" so, you backed the members of
Congress who went along with that swindle because they had reacted to a
matter of what they saw as their own personal or kindred advantage, saying,
in effect:
"It was all your fault for not also being a
smart thief, with thoroughly honest kinds of frankly felonious
characteristics. Be like some of the friends of George Soros or Felix
Rohatyn, or, like me, who listens to a Soros or Rohatyn on how to take a
good profit out of a bad bank."
A physical science consistent with the modern
notions of the interactions of Lithosphere, Biosphere, and Noösphere,
demands a completely different notion of economy: the true benefit of all
mankind and its descendants. That is the exact same standard which must be
reestablished, if our United States is to survive that general
physical-breakdown-crisis of our nation which is in full tilt right now.
Put most simply, the intention of the competent and honest
physical-economic, as distinct from a monetary policy of a nation, is to
effect the net increase of the productive powers of labor for the entire
population of one's own nation, and also that of other parts of mankind.
The
simplest rule-of-thumb for explaining that standard of performance, is
physical: a continuing, science-driven, increase of the productive powers of
labor, one sufficient to overtake the depletion of the relatively richest
concentration of natural resources, that at the same time that we are
increasing the level of relative energy-flux density of the sources of power
used for both production and the maintenance and improvement of the physical
and cultural conditions of life of a growing population.
This brings us to the matter of a science of physical economy, the science
which is the only available remedy for that presently wretched condition of
our planet, a condition which has been produced by the prolonged hegemony of
that monetarist principle over our planet which must be brought finally to
an end within the span of the days and weeks immediately ahead today.
Two Crucial Issues of
Reform
There is no hope, at this time, for an escape from a planet-wide new dark
age of humanity on this planet, unless two successive general reforms are
introduced.
The first, is to eradicate, suddenly, as by action in reorganization in
bankruptcy of a belief in monetarism and its practices, the continued
existence of monetarist systems on this planet.
The second is to developing an operating system of long-term economic values
which correspond to the requirements of a new, scientific system of pricing
, as needed to replace those irrational standards which have been
characteristic of all known monetarist systems, such as the systems
associated with the morally corrupt, and scientifically evil teachings of
the British empiricists such as John Locke, and the associates of that
British East India Company's Haileybury College which served as a center for
the activities and teachings of Adam Smith, the British Foreign Office's
Jeremy Bentham, and for the training of the duped Karl Marx who the British
Foreign Office of Bentham's protégé and successor Lord Palmerston had placed
for training and other uses at the British Museum.
On the matter of the first of those two steps:
Reality runs contrary to the popular
academic, and other merely anecdotal chronicles on the matter. Truth
runs contrary to today's, unfortunately, rarely competent treatment of
the subject of the explicit foundations for the explicit, American
System of political-economy. Ours is a system which has been the only
clear alternative to the monetarist practice of the British imperial
system still today, a system whose foundations were lain in the
Massachusetts Bay Colony's introduction of scrip as a credit system of
the internal economy of the colony itself, during the pre-1688-89
interval.
The case of the Saugus Iron Works attests to
the effect of this. This was revived as a perspective by Benjamin
Franklin's 1729 proposal for a paper currency,83 and was
developed in a working root-form as the American System of
political-economy by Alexander Hamilton as the central feature of
economic policy of the U.S. Federal Constitution.
On the matter of the second step, consider the
matter of the distinction of the arbitrary relative values set by the
controlling influence of financial capital over trade and banking:
No actually scientifically valid system of
valuation has been supplied by the way in which notions of price and
value, respectively, are defined in the history of modern commerce in
the world, up to this present date. To the extent that useful pragmatic
standards for valuation have existed, these have come into play chiefly
through a prudent approach to approximations of relative price by some
governments at certain periods of the relevant nation's life and
relationships among principal trading partners.
The tendency of some nations, and their
partners, to employ so-called "protectionist" measures for domestic
administration and treaty-oriented relations of trade, have provided a
relevant form of approximation of better practice; but, otherwise, there
has been no actually systemic kind of determination of what might be
considered true relative values.
The challenge to be faced on the latter account,
is to be recognized as a reflection of the combined effects of the rising
capital-intensity of competitive forms of production of goods, and the
skyrocketing ratio of the necessary part of public capital investment, as
considered relative to so-called private investment.
This is to be seen most conspicuously in the
two-fold increase in the ratio of investment in basic economic
infrastructure, per capita, for the national and world economies as wholes,
relative to the relatively local investment in extraction, agriculture, and
manufactures.
As the required "life-span" and "relative intensity" of the investment
required, per capita, for the private sector proceeds, at the same time, the
technological progress required even to provide a "steady state" of standard
of living for the citizen, drives up the relative importance and relative
expenditure required for inevitably public investment in science-driven
technological progress in publicly supplied basic economic infrastructure.
This is complicated by the inseparable matter of fact, that the quality of
life and educational development of all of the individuals in society, must
rise, if only to provide a quality of population required for such an
urgently needed course of developments in society generally.
The problem this second set of considerations might be expected to imply to
the ordinary citizen, is that the conditioning of popular opinion today, is
oriented chiefly toward the assumption of a predominantly fixed standard of
economic performance, in which the factor of progress may, or may not be
considered desirable by much of public opinion, such that doom built into
technological and cultural backwardness, or even relative stagnation would
doom society to something akin to the presently onrushing global
breakdown-crisis of the entire planet which has been brought about by
precisely the anti-technological, anti-production-oriented trends in the
post-Franklin Roosevelt world at large today, especially the more depraved,
anti-scientific-progress, cultural trends associated with the rise to power
of the "Baby Boomer" generation today, and with the warnings expressed
against such trends by Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound.
This brings us to the most crucial scientific point of this report.
The Economic Meaning
of Physical Time
To attack the root of the fallacies of those beliefs which have passed for
education in economics, in most relevant places, so far, in the passage of
what we call time, we are best served, by coupling the problematic features
of customary, but a physically incompetent idea of time.
I address this by aid of reference to this issue
as it is central to the failures of all customarily taught beliefs
concerning economics, and with respect to the timeliness of the prospect of
physically relativistic modes of continuously powered flight, as by the
relevant use of Helium-3 isotope taken up from the Moon, between Earth's
Moon and the orbit of Mars, a journey which passes as a prospect of
lapsed-time of days.
I define that unmanned mission as prelude to a
later actual testing, as what experimental evidence shows to be an
appropriately later time, after such a unmanned, flights, in a lapse of time
in the order of something approximately a constant rate of
acceleration-deceleration of one gravity, and, probably, then, later, the
prospect of a lapsed time for a manned flight.
There are numerous problems to be solved in approaching such an essentially
valid prospect either of that, or a similar type. Whatever those problems
may prove to be, and they are being seriously considered without
recklessness, the significance of this information for Earth-bound citizens
today, is that the fact that we see ourselves, or those to come after us, as
being, in fact, at the verge of relativistic space-travel within the
relatively nearby bounds of our Solar System. This signifies that we are at
the verge of a fundamental, physically relativistic change in the quality of
mankind's practical, physical relationship among the parts of this galaxy
which are within our reach either now, or within little more, at best guess,
assuming reasonable conditions, than a relatively few generations ahead.
There are two principal considerations, directly bearing on this matter of
travel to nearby bodies within our space, which bear directly, and
immediately, upon current thinking about economy on Earth today, which have
the most immediate practical sort of importance for understanding those
principles of a science of physical economy which are needed to guide the
successful recovery of humanity from the presently onrushing economic
catastrophe of our planet as a whole.
Essentially, we have touched now, through the
by-products of principally the German, U.S., and Soviet (e.g., Russian)
developments technologies of exploration of nearby space which have led,
most recently, to an aggregation of ten nations presently committed, so far,
to continue, or to begin the exploration of the nearby parts of our Solar
system from operational bases crafted on our Moon.
When U.S. President Kennedy announced that the U.S. was going to the Moon,
"not because it is easy, but because it is hard," he touched, with that
choice of simple language, on a very important, very complex, but also
feasible mission for the future of mankind. The implications of affirming
that point of view, again, now, are vast and profound in terms of the
benefits which we risk to lose if we do not resume President Kennedy's
initiative for the purpose of putting man's active influence on the
development and destiny of the nearest likely choice of nearby planet, Mars.
The immediate benefit on which it is most useful
to focus in this location, is the implications of this space-oriented
development for the transformation, away from the manner in which most
putatively educated people think about the practical meaning of what most
people still think is the meaning of the simple word, "time." This is, as
President Kennedy said, "hard."
Now, here, I shall take up certain of those specific kinds of implications,
especially on the on concept of physical time, rather than clock time,
insofar as they bear on the relatively nearby future of a mankind still
largely confined to living on Earth, or, perhaps, more or less brief
habitation for "industrial" or comparable purposes, among largely
"automated" industries, largely controlled from Earth, on the Moon.84
That much said, in respect to that undertaking, I have two tasks immediately
before me, here, respecting the bearing of these relevant matters to which I
have made reference here. The first of these, is the relatively most obvious
challenge from the standpoint of Earthbound economy, the technical issue of
the proper, necessarily revised meaning of the concept of "physical time,"
rather than a naive notion of mere "clock time," in respect to defining
competent economic investments on Earth here and now.
The second, is the implications for design of
the direction of the policy-making to be conducted, for the next generation
or more, here on Earth itself, the idea of the role of the concept of
physical time, rather than simple clock time, respecting technologies which
are largely, but not exclusively specific to the manned and related
exploration of nearby space beyond our Earth's atmosphere and local
gravitation and magnetic fields experienced.
I proceed, at this point, with a correction of the commonplace, but,
speaking in terms of ontology, scientifically absurd, monetarist notion of a
statistical "time-line" customarily employed for chronically failed attempts
of most of our contemporary, putative economists in the matter of economic
forecasting.
I shall return to the space-science implications
after this aspect has been presented.
A Lesson From the
Used-Car Market
As I came to recognize, a little more than a half-century ago, the most
elementary error of method in attempts at economic forecasting have been the
scientifically fatal blunder of methods of attempted forecasting associated
with applying data, which depend upon a more or less explicitly Cartesian
statistical method of applying selected data to a so-called "time-line."
My first serious test of my systematically
principled criticism on this account, was my professional study of patterns
associated with marketing of automobiles under the umbrella-conditions
shaped by monetarist Arthur Burns' influence on the U.S. national-economic
policies of the Eisenhower years.
My first notable success in forecasting
recessions and depressions came, chiefly, as a result of my studies of the
marketing policies common to the principal automobile manufacturing
enterprises, and the evidence I gathered so which was shown to coincide with
similar patterns in the role of credit in marketing of categories of
household and similar "capital goods" during the course of the pre-February
1957 "Eisenhower years."
This study involved such relevant, included considerations as what I
regarded as a proven element in intended fraud in the crafting of the
dealership agreements which leading automobile manufacturers had imposed
upon the dealers. In short, in instance a new-car sale which involved a
customer trade-in, the manufacturer's agreement required that the new-car
sale be listed, in accounts, as a sale at the fixed "ticketed" price for
that new car; whereas, the discounts which the new-car dealer extended had
actually negotiated with the customer were added to the attributed value, on
the dealer's books, for the used-car trade-in.
"I will give you a discount on this new car,"
meant that the value of the used car taken in trade for the dealer's
used-car lot, required the dealer, implicitly, to attempt to sell that used
car at a present "inventory value" way above the existing market price for a
comparable make, model, and condition of repair, on the general, used-car
market.
As a by-product of the same marketing policies imposed on new-car
dealerships, as the life of the loan repayments reached the thirty-sixth
month (the limit for that part of the 1950s), by 1956, the new car dealer
would write up the thirty-sixth monthly payment due as a "balloon note," an
arrangement crafted on the presumption that by the time the
thirty-sixth-payment came due, the retail customer would have assumed that
the thirty-sixth, "balloon note" amount would vanish, in the melee of the
next, twenty-four-month round of trade-ins.
Thus, it was elementary for me, in the Summer of
1956, to foresee the consequence of that combination of new-car dealers'
jammed up used-car lot and that parallel accumulation of "balloon notes"
left as the residue of earlier years new-car purchases on credit.
The fact that the same pattern to be see in retail automobile marketing,
also prevailed in other relevant categories, made it very clear to me, that
about the time the first quarter of 1957 arrived, there would be the
virtually biggest recession since the immediate beginning of the post-war
market. It happened exactly that way. Obviously, statistical methods of
"time-line" forecasting had nothing to do with much of anything, in this
case.
The lay entirely in the combination of the
policies typified by Arthur Burns, and the induced mentalities of buyer and
seller, all within the boundaries of existing patterns of consumer net
buying-power.
The stubbornness of the prolongation of the effects of the deep 1957
recession, intersected another factor, the competitive stock-piling of
professionals and division executives by expansion-oriented, Wall Street
oriented corporations, in their anticipation of an upward-and-forever-onward
expansion of the white-collar paradises growing and spreading in suburbia.
As the 1957 recession continued, executives and others at pre-1957 salaries
began to be dumped on the Manhattan and other streets, seeking salaries
ranging to about one-quarter of the standard for them in 1956.
My study of those and related medium-term factors in the U.S. economy during
the relevant 1954-1960 interval, and beyond, were as if the proverbial "tip
of the iceberg," which did not yet touch the hard core of the longer-term
capital problem features of the general problem in the U.S. economy at that
time, or later.
Despite the relative boundaries of the problem as I viewed it in 1956-1957,
the matter of the credit-practices typified by the behavior of the
automobile industry, pointed to a more crucial problem,. to a much
deeper-going problem which had been set into motion through the role of the
U.S. Truman Administration, in cutting back on the accumulated productive
potential of the war-time defense industry, rather than, as Franklin
Roosevelt had intended, the urgency of the conversion of what the Truman era
treated as "war surplus" into a part the margin for expansion of the
internal agro-industrial economy of the post-war U.S.A., by aid of the
leveraging of another portion of that capacity for eliminating British and
related imperialism through what had been the imperial territories
controlled by European colonial powers, the territories which the Truman
policies consigned, in a large degree, to the European imperialist, chiefly
Anglo-Dutch, powers.
To restate that matter in relevant terms for our purposes here, the
productivity of the world's nations and their population, depends chiefly on
science-driven technological progress and increasing capital-intensity, per
capita and per square kilometer of territory.
This requires an relevant high rate of
conversion of unskilled and semi-skilled productivity of the labor-force,
and of increased capital-intensity, and effective rises in the mean level of
energy-flux-density available and applied.
In effect, thus, Churchill and Truman employed
the occasion of President Roosevelt's death, to turn back the clock of
progress of mankind, to the effect of scientific technological regression of
such a large part of the households, that the trend in economy was already
being turned backward, from the technological level of productivity which
had been establishing as the economic correlative of the physical-economic
potential unleashed on behalf of the war-effort.
Thus, after the death of the President John F.
Kennedy, who had taken steps to reverse precisely that trend toward economic
backwardness per-capita, as in his fight with the Wall Street steel
interests and the launching of the project for reaching the Moon, the
post-war U.S. economy had reached a zero level in the nation's basic
economic infrastructure by about 1966, and the potential of that economy,
and those of most of Europe and most of the Americas, has been in a general,
long wave of contraction and collapse every since, to the present day.
This means, in particular, that everything nice said about U.S. economy, and
Europe's too, since the death of President John F. Kennedy, is utter
nonsense, and sham.
The role of long wars, especially those in Asia, has a highly significant
role in this dismal trend.
As we should recognize from the case of the World War II economy, and its
post-war experience, especially when we see the effects of waste produced by
prolonged wars in the world's developing sectors, long wars have been a
chief instrument of the British empire, not only in accelerating the ruin of
the economy and morals of the United States in particular, but in the use of
warfare of that sort to create the delusion of economic progress in the
nation at war, while the actual effect of the nominal incomes from
war-making is actually both negative, economically, in and of itself, in
contrast to the NASA space-program launched in an accelerated way by
President Kennedy's initiative.
The British use the fomenting of such folly by
the U.S.A. and others as a way of ruining the U.S.A. and others, exactly as
the British India triumphed through the Anglo-Dutch orchestration of the
original "Seven Years War."
The way a swindle like the Vietnam War, or the recent wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan is staged, is located in the inflationary features of that sort
of "Third World" long-warfare.
The British financier oligarchy, which is the chief culprit in such
swindles. does not care about the effects on its own nation's interests, as
the NICE waves of euthanasia of British subjects by Tony Blair's health-care
policies indicates. The typical members of the British population in general
are, for them, merely dispensable economic cannon-fodder.
The British Empire's interest has never lodged
within the people of the United Kingdom, nor any of the colonies, but in
that British Empire itself, which is a matter of global interest of a class
of an empire, a global monetarist class, not the actual welfare of any
nation. The British empire is not a reflection of the national interest of
the inhabitants of the United Kingdom, but, rather, of an imperial
monetarist oligarchy, for whom heads of government are as disposable as
sheets of toilet paper: once used, are to be destroyed as waste-matter of
the proceedings.
It really helps to make things clearer, if you will only try to understand
the true name of the game in which you, too, are being played.
That said, it is time to consider, in this case, the meaning of physical
time in real economy
The Physics of Time
Now we come to a most crucial point in these proceedings so far: economy as
embodied in physical space-time.
The usual incompetence of professionals in the field of economic
forecasting, is to be traced essentially to the attacks on Gottfried Leibniz
and his work by those followers of Abbé Antonio S. Conti and Voltaire to
whom I have referred here earlier. Recall my emphasis on the shadowy
character of the sense-perceptions of the true believer in sense-certainty,
as opposed to the view of the shadowy meter-readings as seen by the Type "B"
mind.
In short, to remind the reader of this, the
reality of the experience as regarded by the Type "B" mind is located in
what Leibniz had identified as the ontologically infinitesimal. That
infinitesimal is the actual expression of the reality of the experience,
whereas the meter-reading is actually the shadow of the ontologically real
experience.
Ontologically, the infinitesimal is, as Leibniz emphasizes, the expression
of the process of the "becoming" as bounded within a process which is
essentially dynamic, as Leibniz and Bernhard Riemann define dynamic.
Now, apply that to the relationship between an action and the context, such
as a capitalized form of physical potential, as being the type space-time
expression of the relationship between a capital investment and the
application of that investment at a certain point in the lifetime of the
finite value of that investment.
The relationship between the potential and its variable expressions over a
lapse of time, when defined in those terms of reference, is resolved as the
replacement of the function of time by relative space-time. This leads to
such interesting considerations as the relativistic effects associated with
acceleration and deceleration in space-time seen as an expression of
potential; in our case in this discussion for economics, the generation,
consumption, and effects of that potential.
Here, I limit my emphasis to the domain of a
science of physical economy, while conceding the broader implications to be
taken into account by others, as Bernhard Riemann might have cautioned me,
whose special talents are located in a different quality of relevant other
skills.
However, that description of the relationship which I have thus just given,
is only an approximation, but an approximation which serves us here as a way
of introducing a more general notion of efficient physical principle's
function in the domain of physical economy: the approximate ontological
distinction of a process in physical space-time, as distinct from an action
at a particular point in a linear "time-line."
Thus, we depart the domain of mere things as if
occurring at some point on linear time, for the reality of physical
processes in physical space-time. The essential physical-economic
correlation is an action within physical space-time, not linear clock-time.
The expression so described is one of potential, physical-space-time
potential. The potential, so defined, and appropriately measured, are the
essential relations in the physical space-time of a real-life physical
economy.
Clearly, the venture into accelerated trajectories in physical space-time
confronts us, respecting future relations in which all we might have taken
for granted within the confines of our home planet are called into question
for reexamination when we consider accelerated transport between planets as
defining a different quality of physical space-time than we have been
inclined to consider until now.
Therefore recall something from ancient European science.
Contrary to the popular delusions of modern European culture's commonplace
academic opinion, the roots of the modern European physical science, are to
be traced to locations such as what we find convenient to identify as that
ancient Greek civilization typified for modern physical science by such as
the Pythagorean Archytas' construction of the proof of the duplication of
the cube, and by the work of Plato.
However, to summarize here what I have presented earlier in this present
report, at the close of Plato's life, consider a figure who is to be
remembered as both a one-time advisor to the doomed King Philip of Macedon,
and the hate-filled foe of Philip's heir, Alexander the Great. That is the
figure of Aristotle, who is persuasively argued, by some authorities, to
have been the intellectual mother of the hoaxster known as Euclid.
Competent modern science is therefore traced to
such exemplary figures as the Filippo Brunelleschi who overturned Euclid's
hoax, by discovering the use of the catenary as a physical principle of
construction needed to accomplish the otherwise impossible task of
constructing the cupola Santa Maria del fiore, and also the Cardinal
Nicholas of Cusa who was the founder of that tradition of Luca Pacioli,
Leonardo da Vinci expressed by the achievements of Johannes Kepler's
uniquely original discovery of the principle of universal gravitation, and
also a forerunner of Fermat, Leibniz, and so on, through the Bernhard
Riemann, Albert Einstein, and Acaemician V.I. Vernadsky represented, among
the the founders of that system on which the validity in method of all
competent modern physical science has depended since.
The fallacy of Aristotle whose implications I emphasize here, was that
recognized by the contemporary of the Christian Apostles, Philo, (called "Judaeus"
) of Alexandria, who exposed the "God is dead" implications of Aristotle's
proclamation of the kind of arbitrarily closed system associated with the
name of Euclid in modern academic instruction.
This attribution to Aristotle points attention
to both the political and scientific implications of Aeschylus' Prometheus
Bound, in which the satanic figure of character the Olympian Zeus, forbids
man's knowledge of the use of "fire"or nuclear power today.
These references call to our attention the significance the belief in
a-priori assertions of closed systems, such as those of Aristotle and the
figure of the character the Olympian Zeus, the same belief underlying the
defense of both slavery and culturally stagnant systems of serfdom against
human progress, the dogmas which characterize all systemically inhuman,
oppressive forms of oligarchical systems of culture and government, such as
the British monarchy's treatment of African peoples still today.
The unavoidable practical significance of what I have been stating here, on
this point, thus far, is the following lesson in the ABCs of any competent
notion of political economy.
Not only does the growth of population, and improvement of the conditions of
life of the typical human individual of any, and every society and culture,
depend what is typified by scientific and related cultural progress in the
practice of education and of scientific improvement of knowledgeable skills
of management of society's destiny.
The attempt to permit scientific and
technological stagnation, not only delimits, but compresses the possibility
for human life to a relatively smaller, and chiefly oppressed population, in
every case. Even the extinction of the human species, is in a certain a
probable outcome of such "zero growth" social-political models as those of
today's so-called "environmentalists" in the train of Britain's Prince
Philip and his batty ideas about the global mission of a World Wildlife
Fund.
It is the effects of progress, such as those of scientific progress in
productive practice, which are the principal distinction, in the field of
demography, of the human species from that lower form of life known as the
higher apes, and also the worms. In today's science, these are matters which
fall best under that branch of Riemannian physical geometry which is
associated with the legacy of Gottfried Leibniz's discovered concept of
systemic dynamics, and of work of Academician V.I. Vernadsky.
As I have emphasized in an early portion of this present report, the system
on which human life on this planet depends, demands attention to the
interaction of what Vernadsky defined as the respective Lithosphere,
Biosphere, and Noösphere. To remind the reader: The Biosphere draws down
from the Lithosphere, while the Noösphere draws down from the Biosphere,
but, the creative powers of the individual human mind have been able to
increase the net productive powers of mankind in society.
This occurs, despite the effect of the depletion
of the richest concentrations of essential elements from both the
Lithosphere and Biosphere, and even to increase the richness of the
Biosphere in that process of apparent depletion, but to increase the
potential population-density of our species. This occurs, while raising the
standard of intellectual level of both physical productivity per capita, and
cultural development of the human individual to a degree beyond all earlier
precedents.
In other words, all notions of economy must proceed from understanding the
implications of what I have just written here, as in the preceding
paragraphs. To the extent that mankind occupies more portions of the Solar
system, man directs the development within that system, and such as the
Biosphere, and Lithosphere below the rank of mankind is, for physical
science, as the first Chapter of Genesis prescribes. It is contrary to man's
assigned, given nature, to act in any contrary way.
These foregoing considerations are key for understanding the implications of
the absolutely necessary, discarding of the habitual practice of monetarism,
as in globally extended European civilization now.
How, now, shall we enter the new arrangement
under which we must assure ourselves the progress of all mankind, but in a
way which is freed in all essential respects from what has proven itself to
be the cancerous-like effects of the toleration of monetarism?
EPILOGUE: LOOKING BACK FROM MARS
To sum up what has been written here thus far,
the quickest way to reach and understanding of "the new economics" which I
have introduced here, is to think of looking back toward Earth from the kind
of habitat on Mars, a few decades ahead. All definitions and designs for
missions of mankind shall be thought in such terms of defined
mission-orientation of mankind as a whole from this time forward until we
have attained success.
Respecting the specific matter of the future trips of living human beings to
Mars, and return alive and well, there are certain distinctions which must
be frankly considered as being, first of all matters of challenges
respecting notions of universal physical principle. These are several-fold,
but include the effects of relativistic trajectories of travel between
Earth-orbit (or, better said, the Moon) and Mars-orbit.
We have certain inklings from some shockingly
significant features of physical relations in time which have been suggested
by adduced, seemingly extremely anomalous features of the Crab Nebula's
behavior. The first relativistic flights of vehicles, from Earth-orbit to
Mars-orbit must be unmanned tests, in both directions, of effects of the
highly accelerated modes of Earth-Mars and Mars-Earth flights projected for
use in human transport.
Such is the work of pioneers, as by Christopher
Columbus, for Moon-Mars manned flights today.
What I wish to stress in this epilogue, that the indispensable quality of
leadership in science, or in economy, must combine three broadly defined
elements of action. Boldness in abandoning failed habits; boldness in
testing the frontiers of the imagination; and, and, boldness in seeking
alternative choices of boldness for replacing hypotheses which did not quite
work our as intended.
Let us, therefore, now proceed through a series of the type of
approximations which the argument here so far suggests.
In summary, the way to understand the proper choice of the destiny of life
on Earth today, is to think backwards in time, from a view today of going to
and from a future human settlement on Mars.
Develop the capacity to become properly inspired
about man's future.
Footnotes
1. The British empire must be uprooted and
eliminated, without question. This shall be sought through the
eradication of the form of empire which had dominated European
civilization since the Peloponnesian War, monetarism. The United
Kingdom, either as a whole, or any of the three nations separately, once
freed of its role as the center of monetarism, is to be treated55 as
sovereign, by their people according, to their choice, within their
borders. In this matter of choice, the 1648 Peace of Westphalia applies
as an expression of true natural law.
2. Schiller's observation on the French revolution of 1789, that a great
moment in history had found a little people.
3. Adorno and Arendt had wished to joint the Nazi Party in Germany,
until an associate of their persuasion warned them, that they were
Jewish and had no future within the Nazi Party which their co-thinker
Heidegger would join "successfully."
4. One has a sudden image from today's not-so-merry-England, of nude
bodies of representatives of that generation among the English, whose
fat bellys virtually foil a couple's desperate attempts at copulation.
This recalls the sight of a captive Maine lobster with plugged claws,
plugs which prevent the desperate lobster held in the aquarium from
crushing the clam with which he or she is obsessed at the moment.
5. The Obama administration's health-care policy is identical with the "Tiergarten
Vier" practice of the Nazis. Should we not say today, like Gilbert and
Sullivan, that, as for the case of former British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, that "the punishment fits the crime"?
6. The assassination of John F. Kennedy ended both Kennedy's domestic,
anti-Wall Street policy, and Kennedy's attempted implementation of a
policy of the U.S. not entering into "land wars in Asia," a change of
policy which ruined the United States through that fraudulent 'Gulf of
Tonkin" resolution which brought us into the Indo-China war against
former U.S. war-time ally Ho Chi Minh, and the other long wars in Asia
which have ruined the U.S.A. (and other dupes) since then. For those who
opposed Kennedy's pro-industrialist and anti-Asia Wars policy's, the
President's sudden death has proven most convenient for our British and
other adversaries since that time.
7. John Maynard Keynes, Allgemeine Theorie der Beschäftigung, des Zinses
und des Geldes, Fritz Waeger, trans, (Leipzig: Verlag Duncker und
Humblot: 1936) It must be recalled, that at that time, and even until
the Wehrmacht's overrunning France, the British Royal establishment
continued to be essentially pro-Hitler, even after the forced abdication
of King Edward VIII. That continuation of this British royal affection
for Hitler was premised on London's own wishful anticipation that Hitler
would strike East, rather than West, and on the British assumption that
Japan would carry out its assigned duty for both Britain and Hitler by
an attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor which had been planned
as an option, by London and Tokyo since the naval parity negotiations of
the 1920s, a plan for which the British and Japan had been agreed
prospective partners since the early 1920s. On Adolf Hitler's side, his
explicit endorsement of Keynes continued into the early 1940s, when the
attack on Pearl Harbor had already occurred. It must also be noted, that
virtually none of the governments of the continental European nations
which were formed after the close of World War II, had any knowledgeable
insight into the principled differences between the American System of
political-economy and of the difference between the Roosevelt Bretton
Woods and the fraudulent version of the Churchill-Truman-dictated
Bretton Woods system familiar to relevant government officials of the
post-World War II economies.
8. At the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference , President Franklin Roosevelt
and his representatives had crushed the effort by Britain's imperialist
ideologue John Maynard Keynes; as of April 13 1945,immediately upon the
death of President Franklin Roosevelt, President Harry Truman connived
with Winston Churchill, to scrap President Roosevelt's Bretton Woods
policy entirely, and to adopt Churchill's demand for defense of
Britain's system of pre-war imperialism, and the corresponding
imperialist monetarism of Keynes.
9. I must emphasize, that the anti-imperialist opposition to the British
empire, does not represent any threat to the general welfare of a
post-imperialist United Kingdom, which could then perform a useful role
among the sovereign states of Europe. The essential foe which we must
crush, is the international, monetarist oligarchy of the monarchy's
globally extended imperial monetarist system. The enemy of our U.S.A. is
a globally extended monetarist oligarchical system, which includes the
Manhattan circles currently associated with entities such as Goldmann
Sachs. I must also emphasize the error of confusing the necessary,
continuing role of financial accounting systems, with the measures of
value required for cost and income accounting. This is a distinction
which I make clear at the relevant later point in this present report.
10. Strange notions passed through the U.S. Supreme Court, which might
be contrary to this principle, must be annulled by being returned to the
categorical source of the error from which they originated. This applies
to the exemplary role of the British East India Company puppet, Martin
van Buren, whose puppet-in-turn, President Andrew Jackson, wrecked the
Second National Bank of the United States to make way for the treasonous
wrecking of the credit of our United States, by larcenous van Buren's
panic of 1837, or the creation of a Federal Reserve system designed to
ruin the U.S. dollar through such channels of usury as the Bank of
England and Basel Bank for International Settlements. Should the Supreme
Court, for example, prevent such action by the U.S. Government, as the
bankruptcy of forty-seven U.S. states give us forewarning, that
government, and, therefore, also the Supreme Court would which sought to
block needed patriotic reforms would quickly cease to exist, entirely of
their own accord.
11. e.g., identity 'B" in the preceding report. Note that creativity
does exist in both the Lithosphere and Biosphere, but only in the
Noösphere is it voluntary.
12. It is Aristotle and Nietzsche, who are, in fact, dead, and almost
certainly, unlike the best among us, with no souls then to show for it.
Some clerics may wish that the souls of very bad bad people are being
tortured. I prefer to presume that they are no more than footprints, or
waste-matter left behind.
13. When I refer to the "68ers" in this manner of speaking and writing,
I am to be understood as pointing to the intrinsically morally
degenerate types associated with such circles as those of what became
the "Weatherman" terrorists associated with Mark Rudd et. al. I signify
the controlling influence of that stratum within that generation which
functioned as the vehicle under whose influence the rock-drug-sex,
anti-science culture assumed a controlling degree of dynamic influence
over most members of that generation of which the "Weatherman" typified
as products of both the existentialism of Adorno and Arendt in the
U.S.A. and Germany, and the degenerates known as associated with the
Congress for Cultural Freedom in Europe.
14. Some form of continued acceleration-deceleration is required for
this Moon-orbit to moon-orbit, or return. Separate systems are required
for moon-planet and planet-moon "shuttling."
15. All residues which have been deposited in a form which has been
determined by living processes are to be counted as fossils within the
category of the Biosphere, just as all residues specific to mankind's
changes in the behavior of the Biosphere's past and present products are
to be counted as part of the aggregate of the Noösphere.
16. The avowed commitment by Leipzig's great mathematician Abraham
Kästner's (A.D. 1719-1800) stated, life-long commitment to defense of
the work of both the great Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Sebastian Bach,
and and his related roles in promoting the work of both his Gotthold
Lessing and Moses Mendelssohn against the corruption spread by the
Eighteenth-century Liberals, and in his role in promoting the cause of
the United States, is of crucial relevance in these matters of the
shaping of world history since that time.
17. This point is implicit in Carl F. Gauss' poor opinion of the work of
such misguided claimants to a discovery of non-Euclidean geometry as
Lobachevsky and Jonas Bolyai. There is no reasonable doubt that Gauss
had, as he claimed, however elliptically, actually discovered a true
anti-Euclidean geometry, and had progressed from the foundations of the
work of his famous teacher Abraham Kästner in this matter. An fully
competent, explicit anti-Euclidean geometry was introduced to the
general knowledge of modern science in the opening paragraphs of
Bernhard Riemann's 1854 habilitation dissertation.
18. The fact that one employs a creative potential within oneself, to
produce the moral effective of a bloody car-wreck, does not mean that
the employment of a creative potential in that outcome was an expression
of beauty.
19. This is not to imply that Lobatchevsky's work was not brilliant and
competent in its own way; as Gauss noted, the flawed discovery of Jonas
Bolyai was professionally skilled, too. The point is, that as Gauss
emphasized in his criticisms of such works as those, neither of those
authors grasped Gauss's own concept of an actually anti-Euclidean
geometry, the same concept later presented explicitly by Bernhard
Riemann in his 1854 habilitation dissertation. A Riemannian geometry is
a physical geometry of a class of those geometries attuned to "living
within" a physical space-time extended by continuing acceleration: not a
merely formal geometry (e.g., reality as the plot of a trajectory from
Earth, in Earth orbit, to Mars, in a Mars orbit, using a pathway defined
according to a constant rate of acceleration-deceleration based on
normal human requirements, that under the condition that the persons are
within the vehicle, and are experiencing that trajectory, rather than
experiencing it as if from the apparent world of "the outside
observer.") Then, redefine the notion of the relevant tensor, as a
physical concept, rather than merely mathematical, from a related,
restricted notion of a physical, rather than a merely mathematical
conception. The crucial consideration is, that a Riemannian geometry
rejects that notion of so-called "completeness," as that subject was
famously promoted by the positivist David Hilbert, an echo of the notion
of "completeness" of Aristotle and his follower Euclid, as this notion
had been attacked by Philo of Alexandria. The catenary-tractix principle
of Filippo Brunelleschi's and Nicholas of Cusa's follower Leonardo da
Vinci, is to be defined as the catenary was employed by Brunelleschi for
the construction of the cupola of Santa Maria del Fiore, a notion of the
catenary which was based, for example, on the funicular principle of a
physical curvature, rather than a formal geometry, is an example of
this. Nicholas of Cusa's De Docta Ignorantia is an illustration of this
notion of open-ended, physical-geometrical physical principles, as
distinct from merely formal (e.g., "completable," intrinsically entropic)
geometries. So, Johannes Kepler's uniquely original discovery of a
universal principle of gravitation, did not represent a mere product of
his mathematical formulation for the effect of gravitation, and was not,
therefore, not merely something which might be fairly copied by
plagiarists such as the patrons of an absurd Isaac Newton. These
anti-Euclidean, physical geometries, such as Kepler's uniquely original
discovery, earlier, as described in his New Astronomy, identified a
principle which expressed the process of generation of the Earth's
"elliptical" orbit ("equal areas, equal times"), based on the principle
of Cusa's De Docta Ignorantia, rather than an orbit generated from the
merely formal-mathematical construction of a formal ellipse. Notably,
Cusa had already denounced the systemic fallacy of Archimedes' notion of
the representation of the generation of a circle by quadrature. My
emphasis in this footnote, is that the method of Burnelleschi and Cusa
is also that of Leibniz, Gauss, Riemann, Max Planck, Albert Einstein,
and Academician V.I. Vernadsky, as opposed to that of the formalists:
formalists including that same, celebrated David Hilbert who recognized
both Norbert Weiner and John von Neumann as fakers polluted by their
Bertrand Russell pedigree. The same, widely accepted error of formal
completeness was defended by my friend Pobisk Kuznetsov, who thus, on
that occasion, defended the fallacy of closed systems otherwise
underlying the fallacious dogma of thermodynamics of Clausius, Grassmann,
Kelvin, et al. The deep-rooted, systemic difference in methods, so
expressed, is to be traced to the functional difference between the
qualitatively inferior, but more customary, quasi-Euclidean, pro-Aristotelean
mental world-outlook typical of the "Type A" cases I treat here, as
"Type A" is to be contrasted to the higher quality of mental life
expressed by that "Type B" personality which is essential for living
within a relativistic, "Type 'B'."
20. This was the issue of the brutish attack on Leibniz by the
Eighteenth-century empiricists, such as D'Alembert, A. de Moivre,
Leonhard Euler, and J. L. Lagrange, and the continuation of that attack
by Laplace and Augustin Cauchy. The attack was organized chiefly,
beginning about 1714-1718, through a hoax organized by the
Paris-resident Venetian (Padua) nobleman resident in Paris which was
organized by Abbe Conti Antonio S. Conti in concert with Voltaire. Conti
was an impassioned advocate of the discredited doctrine of Rene
Descartes. Conti was intimately associated with Voltaire.
21. but unbounded (e.g., anti-entropic).
22. Contrary to a largely fraudulent, and systemically incompetent
opinion of rabid amateurs such as the the British empire's stooge and
former U.S. Vice-President Al Gore, the world has currently entered a
cooling phase, comparable to that which occurred during the late
Eighteenth and early Nineteenth centuries. The purpose of the promoting
of the World Wildlife Fund-sponsored, outright lie of "global warming"
by vampire-bat lovers such as Prince Philip, is the British empire's
intent to prevent any economic recovery which might echo the awesome
threat to a world-wide British empire called "globalization," which
President Franklin Roosevelt's great economic recovery had represented
during his term in office. The spoor of the calendars developed bt those
indicated ancient mariners to I make implicit reference here is the
evidence on which I am relying.
23. E.g., Adam Smith, The Theory of the Moral Sentiments, Chapter III
ff.: "Of universal benevolence:" " ... The administration of the great
system of the universe, however, the care of all rational and sensible
beings, is the business of God and not of man. To man is allotted a much
humbler department, but one much more suitable to the weakness of his
powers, and to the narrowness of his comprehension; the care of his own
happiness, and that of his family, his friends, his country: that he is
occupied in contemplating the more sublime, can never be an excuse for
his neglecting the more humble department: that he must not expose
himself to the charge which Avidius Cassius is said to have brought,
perhaps unjustly, against Marcus Antonius; that while he employed
himself in philosophical speculations, and contemplated the prosperity
of the universe, he neglected the Roman Empire. ... But though we are
entrusted with a very strong desire of those ends, it has been entrusted
to the slow and uncertain determinations of our reason to find out the
proper means of bringing them about. Nature has directed us to the
greater part of these by original and immediate instincts. Hunger,
thirst, the passion which unites the two sexes, the love of pleasure,
and the dread of pain, prompt us to apply those means for their own
sakes, and without any consideration of their tendency to those
beneficent ends which the great Director of nature intended to produce
by them." According to certain disputable passages from Genesis, so
spake the Serpent to Eve, in the Garden of Eden, as "serpents" in the
form of such as Peter Orszag and Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel have spoken to
President Barack Obama, or, their likeness had inspired Adolf Hitler
before them. Such is the root-doctrine of that intended copy of the old
Roman Empire which informed the composition of that empire of Lord
Shelburne which Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham, and Edward Gibbon served
with that same Pythian devotion. Such is the inherent bestiality of
philosophical behaviorism.
24. It must be emphasized that the publication of Smith's Theory of
Moral Sentiments was published in 1759 almost four years prior to
Smith's personal commission by Lord Shelburne to spy against the
Americans and French. Smith was selected by Shelburne for the quality of
universalizing evil which he already embodied.
25. In Portugal, Columbus encountered the writings of Nicholas of Cusa
outlining such projects of trans-oceanic cooperation with people on
distant continents.
26. Also highly significant was the June, 1894 assassination of France's
President Marie Francois Sadi Carnot.
27. The arrangements for preparing the assassination were made through
the anarchist Emma Goldman who was, at the time, a controller of a New
York City's Henry Street settlement house. The assassin, Leon Czolgoz
had followed Emma Goldman to Cleveland, Ohio, where she delivered a
rabble-rousing address. Thence, he went to Buffalo, to assassinate the
President. The key figure in the connections of the Henry Street
Settlement House at that time, was U.S. Vice-President Theodore
Roosevelt, the nephew, and protégé of the James Bulloch who had headed
the Confederacy intelligence service's operations from within London
during the Civil War, and who was the sponsor of Teddy Roosevelt's
political career. McKinley had been commissioned in military service to
the republic during the Civil War.
28. Cf. Marsha Freeman, Krafft Ehricke's Extraterrestrial Imperative
(1971). The development of the physical economy on the Moon, as
preparation for man's venture to more distant extraterrestial, goals,
must be clearly understood as a precondition for man's development of
our sites for man on other planets.

31. This fact respecting former British policeman Napoleon III is of
crucial importance, in the respect of the grave error of Germany's
Wilhelm I in evading Chancellor Bismarck's understanding that Germany
(then, Prussia and its German allies) must make peace with the France,
once the British agent Napoleon III were toppled. Otherwise, a
continuation of embittering warfare between Germany and France would
play into what Bismarck understood as being British imperialist hands
and intentions. So, it was the ouster of Bismarck by the foolish puppet
of the Prince of Wales Edward Albert, the Prince's nephew Wilhelm II,
and the similar folly of Edward Albert's other nephew, Russia's Nicholas
II, which led to the ruin of Germany, and the life of Czar Nicholas,
under the leadership of the foolish Wilhelm II.
32. Should we praise the singer in opera for the delicious color of

33. i.e., William Empson, Seven Types of Ambiguity, (1947). My own
encounter with this book was my purchasing it from the counter of a
bookshop down the street from the Boston public library, in that year. I
quickly wrapped myself inside it, with repeated readings during the
several weeks which followed. Some of it was new to me with the
acquisition of that text; more important for me was what it opened up
for my deeper understanding. That writer was truly a great talent.
34. Newton discovered nothing of more importance than that which he
expressed, as a member of the British parliament, as his perception of
the need to please "open a window" in those stuffy quarters. He did not
even plagiarize what is claimed for him; the plagiarism was done by
others, and served as if on a platter with an attached notice containing
his name. On the actual historical taken from Newton's own chest of
scientific papers, from his only active academic field, was black magic.
The original plagiarism of Kepler crafted in Newton's name, was taken
essentially from published works of Kepler circulating in English, in
England, during that time. The fraudulent claim for the calculus was
concocted by the Paris-resident Venetian Abbe Antonio S. Conti who
launched the swindle under the rubric of his suggestion that the work of
Rene Descartes be reworked in English for the purpose of creating an
English Descartes who would be credited, fraudulently with Leibniz's
already well known discovery. It was the same Conti, working in concert
with Voltaire, who launched the now traditional lies about Newton's
claimed discovery of the calculus mouthed by bread-bought scientists
seeking secure employment, still today. The project was run through the
course of the Eighteenth Century, through such devotees of this hoax as
"Three-body" Laplace and Laplace's "Riggoletto," the plagiarist Augustin
Cauchy. As to the relevance of my observations on such account, one must
not overlook the fact that such scientific frauds as those have served
as the foundations for the failed dogmas of leading economics practice
today.
35. There is, admittedly, an extremely useful ambiguity to be considered
in adopting an English-language title for this work by Kepler. Does he
mean the worlds, or the Solar system (implicitly) as a whole, as a
"world"? I prefer "worlds," but I also emphasize that adherence to the
indicated ambiguity itself is perhaps the most useful transliteration,
pedagogically.
36. Cauchy adopted a paper by Niels Abel as his own. He was suspected of
this by leading scientists who knew Abel's work and Cauchy's own, but
the plagiarism was not proven until an audity of Cauchy's files turned
up the original copy of the Abel work, neatly filed and noted in
Cauchy's collection.
37. E.g., the denunciation of the fraud of the Aristoteleans, respecting
Creation, by the friend of the Apostle Peter, Rabbi Philo (Judaeus) of
Alexandria.
38. Taking into account that Kepler had left one essential term of the
formulation attributed to Newton to be developed by a future scientist.
39. It is not merely to be admitted, but emphasized, that even the
science departments of many leading universities have been frequently
turned into a special sort of the "blab schools" created to pretend to
educate late Nineteenth, and early Twentieth centuries' so-called
"Mountain Whites." They undertake no actual responsibility for proving
anything except the credulities of their students. For such students,
and, often, their professors, everything lies ultimately under the
presumption that the effects of the doctrine will be self-evident.
40. I would suggest that you consider the possibility, that when you
might think you are studying a portrait produced by Rembrandt, that he,
somewhere in the simultaneity of eternity, has been already watching
you. Even Philo of Alexandria was probably already watching it all, too.
41. The Nazi-like health-care policies of President Obama are a
by-product of the work of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the
man who launched the recent war in Iraq with a shameless lie. However,
the origin of the Hitler health-care policies underlying Hitler's
practice of genocide, were also explicitly introduced to Hitler Germany
from the Malthusian population policies of the United Kingdom and
Britain's Wall Street agents, and some-time Hitler-lovers, in the United
States. In plain fact, the health-care policies of President Obama are
identical with those for which we hung Nazi officials in Nuremberg and
related post-World War II proceedings.

43. This was the Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) who is most noted for his
fundamental contribution to modern science as treated by Bernhard
Riemann, "Theorie der Abel'schen Functionen" [Werke pp. 88-144]. The
Abel paper on "abelian functions."Abel had delivered his most crucial of
these works for circulation through the hands of Cauchy, in Paris, where
they, after Abel's 1829 death, remained in the hands of Cauchy until
Cauchy's own death in 1857. Cauchy had claimed Abel's discoveries as his
own during the 1929-interval, even against the insistence of the fact of
Cauchy's plagiarism by a number of leading European scientists with the
competence to demonstrate Cauchy's fraud. The paper of Abel which Cauchy
had denied possessing, turned up amid Cauchy's mortal remains, neatly
catalogued, by the auditors of the deceased Cauchy's effects. The death
of Cauchy completes a certain dirty cycle in the history of science,
located between 1667 (the birth of Abraham de Moivre and death of Cauchy
in 1857) in that dirty side of the history of the mathematics associated
with physical science.
44. Take for example, the case of Riemann's zeta function [Über die
Anzahl der Primzahlen under einer gegebenen Größe (Werke pp. 145-156]
The modern history of this subject dates to Pierre de Fermat, passes
through Euler, and turns up in a restatement of the case by Lejeune
Dirichlet, and the best solution to date, that of Riemann. My attention
to this matter is limited here to a class of problems typified by the
case of David Hilbert's efforts to defend the most devastating of the
formal fallacies of a positivist geometry in the footsteps of Euclid:
the attempt to define a theory from the assumption of the eternal
completeness an arbitrarily concocted a-priori principle. For example
one attack on Riemann was, by based on the gossip, even by a highly
reputable physicist, that his treatment did not prescribe a "final"
prime number.

the Island of Elba, a culture related to the Hittites.
49. There was also a certain relevant scandal associated with the
activities of von Neumann in the are of the work of the circles of
Hilbert and Richard Courant. but that bears on the behavior of von
Neumann, not Hilbert or Courant. I found no connection of this specific
activity of von Neumann then to the earlier role of Weiner there.
50. The worshipper should have recognized positivism's sulfurous
theological implications. For useful suggestions consult Dante
Alighieri's Inferno.
51. As a beloved Jewish rabbi said, implicitly echoing Philo, God does
not send the Messiah on a railway time-table schedule. I find nothing
strange in the physical-scientific profundity of a well-educated Apostle
Paul's I Corinthians 13 use of what is translated as "through a glass
darkly." Here we encounter, not some simple-minded mysticism, but the
Apostle's standpoint in a "Type 'B' " personality, an intellectual
quality not strange to the most literate Jews of the Greek cultural
tradition of that time. Jews hated for precisely such reasons by the
Emperor Tiberius whose son-in-law carried out the Roman crucifixion of
Jesus, a type of execution which had to be authorized by the Emperor, as
through the authority of Pontius Pilate as the "son-in-law" of that
Tiberius stalking the cliff-side walks on the Isle of Capri sacred to the
Roman branch of the cult of Mithra, at that time. Sometimes, it is not
the more ancient cultures which had generated strange myths; sometimes,
strange myths, such as axiomatic belief in Euclid, is created to conceal
the embarrassing evidence of an unwanted, but truthful scientific fact.

away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will

to the mathematician Dr. Jonathan Tennenbaum then associated with me,
that he craft a presentation which would show the profitably interesting
shortcomings iof Minkowski's mistaken choice of the kind of space-time
to be adduced. Nonetheless, I found Minkowski's lecture stunning when I
first read it in 1941, and its style still burns in my memory
sixty-eight years later, despite the elementary, but delightfully
forgiveable mistake in Minkowski's choice of geometry, the fact which I
pointed out to Tennenbaum a score years past.
54. Ludwig Boltzmann hanged himself, on September 5, 1906, while a guest
at the Turn and Taxis family property at Duino, known in that time for
being a strange place. The setting of this death has a relevance in the
history of modern science referenced here, but involves an account which
must be put to one side for reporting on another day.
55. This is also illustrated by that systemic weakness in the otherwise
often brilliant work of Georg Cantor, shown in his craven submission to
his most devout adversary, Bertrand Russell, a submission which drove
Cantor insane in the end. Familiarity with Cantor's work points to the
factor of the influence of Weierstrass on Cantor's avoidance of Riemann.
56. Just as past physical-capital and comparable improvements are
contributions from the past to the present, so capital improvements with
significantly prolonged "lives" are essential contributions to both
current productivity and to the current welfare of society now. The
relation of the accumulation and depletion of what are efficiently of
such as character as active factors of benefit delivered to the present
from the past, or to, or from the future, points our attention to the
physical meaning of time as such, and, at the same time, points out the
importance of this notion of physical time, rather than mere clock time,
for all phenomena. Thus, the unrepaired ongoing depletion which has been
accumulated, as in the role of an unpaid bill on the account of lack of
necessary capital improvements, warns us that the apparent level of
current population fails to take into account the fact that British-led
international economic policies have dropped the potential relative
population-density of the Earth's population far below sustainable
levels, Only an immediate unleashing of a capital-intensive increase of
capital-intensity in the productive powers of labor per capita and per
square kilometer, could prevent the presently onrushing threat of a new
dark age for all humanity. In short, cancel the British empire and the
international monetarism it represents, or else. In short: "Dear Larry
Summers, in our kindly goodbyes to your role in government, we must
caution you: you will not be missed much."
57. It is important to emphasize, especially for non-professional
readerships at this point, that virtually none of the important theorems
and related aspects of what was presented as Euclidean Geometry were
originally produced by Euclid himself. Rather, Euclidean geometry was a
doctrine superimposed on a variety of contributions of earlier authors.
It is the dogma of systemic a-priorism superimposed in the name of
Euclid which is the fault addressed here.
58. It was in a different library, during that same period, that I
encountered Princeton's Luther Pfahler Eisenhart's 1926 Riemannian
Geometry (Princeton). That experience put my off my commitment to
Riemann, until early 1953, when I became absorbed by Riemann's
habilitation dissertation, an encounter which shaped all my subsequent
engagement with the field of economy. My habitual reliance on that
Library for sundry research purposes, had begun with an assignment to
compose report on the case of Captain William Kidd, which required hours
spent in the Library's archive of early Eighteenth-century printed
publications, and thus gave me habit of treating the Library for a time
as almost a second home.
59. That under the "adheres to their enemies" passage of the U.S. Code.
The Confederacy was created from, and by the British Foreign office,
under that Office's Jeremy Bentham, and both continued and executed as
warfare against the United States (and Mexico), under Bentham's trained
protégé and successor, Lord Palmerston. Although enslavement of persons
taken from Africa, or of African descent otherwise, had already been
introduced to North America by the British East India Company earlier,
the launching of what became the Confederacy insurrection was expressed
in actions typified by Andrew Jackson's treasonous affinities to the
British agent of Chatham House, Aaron Burr, and in the crucially
significant matter of that systematic destruction of the formerly
autonomous Cherokee Nation which was executed on behalf of opening up
that Nation's territory for the London-directed program of expanded
African slavery in the United States. Britain continued the capture and
transport of Africans into enslavement in the U.S.A. through the British
puppet also known as the Spanish monarchy of the post-Vienna Congress
period. British policy in Africa, as toward Sudan, Zimbabwe, and others,
reflects the same essentially underlying characteristics to the present
moment. The U.S.A. alliance with Britain in what is called World War I,
is almost entirely a reflection of the treasonous inclinations of
Presidents Theodore Roosevelt (himself the trained and dutiful nephew of
the British agent who ran the war-time Confederate intelligence
service), and the Woodrow Wilson, the Ku Klux Klan fanatic. In the
1920s, the British empire connived with the government of the Mikado of
Japan in the planning of, and preparation for the future attack on Pearl
Harbor by the same Empire of Japan which ha been allied for war against
the U.S.A. by Britain's Prince of Wales, Edward Albert, had set into
motion with the launching of the warfare of Japan against China over the
course of the 1894-1945 interval. Although it was the technicality of
Adolf Hitler's attack on Belgium and France to the west, which actually
broke the British Empire's backing for Hitler's warfare under Prime
Minister Chamberlaintemporarily; thereafter, British empire resumed its
intention to break up the United States up through the present time, as
aided in this by such means as luring us into land wars in Asia which
have wasted our economy and our morals, as in Tony Blair's role in the
recent Iraq War, and President Obama's currently insane strategic folly
in Afghanistan, and has duped a now elected President of the U.S.A. into
courses of action, steered by frankly evil figures such as former
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, to destroy the United States through
the assistance of subversive influence over the policy-making of the
incumbent President of our United States, Barack Obama.
60. This feature of U.S. constitutional law first appeared under the
Massachusetts Bay Colony as a system of scrip whose circulation was
restricted to commerce within that colony, as a form of credit/debt
internal to the sovereignty of the colony. This system was crushed from
England, under James II and William and Mary, but was revived as a
proposal for a "paper currency" by Benjamin Franklin, A Modest Inquiry
into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency (1729). It was
introduced in the form of the concept of national banking under
Alexander Hamilton, and become the core-principle of the decision to
craft and establish the U.S. Federal Constitution.
61. E.g., Plantagenet pretender Cardinal Pole, Thomas Cromwell, and
Henry VIII's marriage counselor, and cabbalist Francesco Zorzi (aka "Giorgi").
the author of Harmonia Mundi the attack on the work of Nicholas of Cusa.
62. There could be no decent criticism which would object to my choice
of imagery for this occasion. All "Type 'B' " intellects think in terms
of what Gottfried Leibniz defined, in opposition to that incompetent
wretch Rene Descartes, as the universal physical principle of dynamics,
as during its relevant efforts during the 1690s, and in his work in
cooperation with Jean Bernouilli in the original discovery of a
universal physical principle of least action. I have already emphasized
here, in earlier pages, that that principle of dynamics is the same
principle which Percy Shelley presents in the concluding paragraph of
his
A Defence of Poetry, Mass social behavior of societies is usually
guided by dynamic principles which move masses of people, including the
commonplace national leaders, who are directed, chiefly unwitting, like
puppets on the master's strings. In competent political and physical
science, alike, only what have been relatively exceptional individuals,
rather than more popular ones, who are exceptions to the kind of
puppet-like behavior shown by most formally recognized leaders of
nations since that death of President Franklin Roosevelt, when either
feigned or actual stupidity was so often the key to the successful
election or appointment of what were regarded as the leaders of society.
I know; for nearly eighty-seven years, I was there, and, for many of
those decades, witting in such matters. It is in the domain of those
powers of the imagination associated with Classical poetry, drama,
music, and the greatest Classical sculptors, architects, and painters,
that the Classical artistic training of the powers of imagination supply
the insight which succeeds in physical science when mathematics fails.
63. The existence of national sovereignty in actual practice, requires a
nation to maintain the essential economic elements of national integrity
of daily economic life within its own borders. "Globalization" is a new
name for "A Tower of Babel," or, what is also to be recognized as
"British imperialism today." Any break in a major chain of nominal
credit within the relatively globalized world system of today, tends to
cause a general, genocidal breakdown of the system as a whole. The U.S.
dollar is presently the most critical of the links in that already much
"globalized" chain. The dollar goes down: the world goes down
immediately. The system has already been stretched beyond its limit,
precisely by the effects of globalizationthe new British-built Tower of
Babel is already overripe to fall; one significant pin-prick and the
entire world system does down in a catastrophic implosion. Thoroughly
corrupt, babbling idiots, such as U.S. Representative Barney Frank, are
typical of politicians so deluded by their obsession with their own evil
schemes, that what is happening in the real world does not exist for
them; they, like an insane gambler, see only their own wishful
obsessions.
64. Named for U.S. Senators Harold Burton and Lister Hill.
65. Notably, the health-care agenda of President Barack of Obama
expresses an radically immoral degree of disregard for the difference
between human beasts and beasts, that in a degree notorious for the
precedent of the Adolf Hitler regime during the September 1939-1945
interval. The Obama echo of that Hitler "Tiergarten 4" policy which led
into the methods of the war-time concentration-camp "death camp"
operations express a philosophy already extant in the British NICE-NIH
practice, a "death-camp" like intention at the center of the Obama
administration's currently proposed health-care policies of practice.
E.g. Obama advisor Ezekiel Emmanuel. The intention to accomplish the
aims of Universal Public Health, is properly defined as a national
security policy of all decent nations which, unlike President Obama,
recognize categorical distinction of human beings from beasts. Between
the human race and Obama's health-care mafia, there is a fundamental
difference in species of practice.
66. Later, during the 1890s, the same Mikado jumped shift, going over to
become the British ally in a way which would lead to Japan's ruin in
World War II, because he was told by the British Royal Family, that he,
like them, was an emperor, and "we emperors" might stick together
against the U.S.A. That was Japan's policy as a puppet of London in the
wars against China, Korea, and Russia of the post-1894 period, and was
the basis of the 1920s alliance of Britain and Japan to destroy the
naval power of the U.S.A.'s naval forces in both the Atlantic and
Pacific waters, the Anglo-Japan alliance of the 1920s which led. to
Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, and to the trial of the American patriot
Billy Mitchell in a courts-martial orchestrated by the British
ideologues in the U.S. military..
67. You can not bargain for influence over Barack Obama; he is a worse
than highly neurotic Narcissus, a not-so-very-bright, mere gabber, a
British puppet who does not really own his own soul.
68. I do not object to the actor's taking pride in the performance,
after the performance; quite the contrary. Let him, or her, "let it
out," but with decent respect placed foremost for those accomplishments
of the others, on which the success of the performance of the whole
depends. However that may be, within the performance itself, as in
combat, each performer must submit humbly to the accomplishment of the
proper identification of the mission as a whole. Never let the performer
bring his, or her ego in from the street outside; mission orientation,
always!
69. One must therefore wonder, whence so many modern academics heavily
laden with higher degrees, obtained their opinions in this matter; they
had, certainly, never worked through the thoroughly detailed account by
Kepler himself. Was that not actually pretty immoral of them?
70. I forecast a likely breakdown as a relatively early oncoming in
1966, which occurred in the successive developments in Britain and the
U.S.A. between Autumn 1967 (in Britain) and February 1968 (in the
U.S.A.). This process of a breakdown continued to operate through the
Summer and Autumn of 1971, and even at that latter time, my British
opponent, Professor Abba Lerner, reputed, then to be the leading
Keynesian of that time, guessed wrong in his Queens College debate
against me.
71. The doctrine of Aristotle provided the basis for the "God is dead"
argument of Friedrich Nietzsche, against which Philo of Alexandria
argued, in defense of the power of a living God, on behalf of Judaism,
against the evil Aristotle. Hence, we have the distinction between
physical curves, such as Brunelleschi's use of the physical principle of
the catenary for crafting the construction of the cupola of Santa Maria
del fiore. and the development of a anti-Euclidean, physical geometry by
Nicholas of Cusa (e.g., De Docta Ignorantia) and the definition, by
Cusa's follower Leonardo da Vinci, of the functional relationship of the
catenary (and catenoid) to the tractrix. The uniquely original
development of the universal physical of least action by Leibniz, in
collaboration with Jean Bernouilli, is an illustration of this, as is
the modern physical geometry of Bernard Riemann, and such among
Riemann's more notable followers, such as Albert Einstein and V.I.
Vernadsky. This is a crucial difficulty in the practice of science,
still today, a difficulty shown by a prevalent tendency to confuse a
fictional, a-priori geometry, with real-life, physical curvatures.
72. See that much maligned (by oligarchical factions) of Italy's
republican patriot, Niccolo Macchiavelli, on the principles of modern
European military science treated from the comparative standpoint of
ancient Roman experience. Those who have neglected such studies,
including, apparently, even some modern general officers. are often to
be told to "shut up until you know what you are talking about." Let them
begin with attention to the role of Macchiavelli's official activity, in
the train of Leonardo da Vinci's direct influence, in the struggle for
the defense of the Republic of Florence, a role for which Macchiavelli
was virtually held captive for the remainder of his life, since the
crushing of the republic of Florence by the oligarchical interests.
73. So, from Act II of Hamlet, we have: "Now, I am alone. What a rogue
and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, but
in a fiction, in a dream of passion, could force his soul so to his own
conceit . . . Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have. . .
That guilty creatures, sitting at a play, have by the very cunning of
the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimed
their malefactions; . . . The play's the thing wherein I'll catch the
conscience of the king." All of which leads, as fatefully, to the
outburst of existentialist despair of the celebrated Act III soliloquy.
74. It may be significant for readers with some relevant background in
science, that there are some greater differences, than agreements,
between the kind of already defective, essentially Euclidean,
mechanistic world-outlook of the associates of Klein, Mach, Hilbert, and
Minkowski, from the utterly depraved positivism which claims its own
birth from Bertrand Russell's Principia Mathematica. Hence, what I have
already referenced here as Hilbert's chucking Professor Norbert Weiner
and John von Neumann out of Göttiingen on grounds of their manifest
utter incompetence in science.
75. Arthur Burns, who Columbia University Professor Dwight Eisenhower
acquired through their association at that University at that time,
contributed more to wrecking the U.S. economy over three decades,
including the creation of the career in economics of the Golem Milton
Friedman, than any U.S. influential in that profession, prior to the
rise of the influence of the right-wing fanatic, virtual British agent,
and political step-mother of California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,
George Shultz.
76. The trend toward a so-called "environmentalist" trend authored by
the late Bertrand Russell et al., as combined with the monstrously
destructive effects of so-called "globalization," has allowed a
depletion of the physical-capital resources of the planet, to such
effect that at the same time that the world's population has increased
to about 6.7 billions, the long-term "carrying capacity" has been
willfully reduced, through suppression of what had been available
progress to a sustainable improvement of a growing population of the
world, to an "environmentalism"-driven lowering of the planet's economic
potential toward the foreseeable potential of about two billions, or
less. This depletion is entirely due to the effect of post-Franklin
Roosevelt policies traced essentially to circles typified by the
combination of the influences of the Bertrand Russell who had demanded
the launching of "preventive nuclear warfare" against the Soviet Union
in September 1946, and the pro-fascist authors of the World Wildlife
Fund.
77. I have had personal knowledge through the most relevant British
sources, respecting incidents at Heathrow and relevant other locations
during the early months of 1974. I assessed the situation from the
pattern of facts available to me, facts which were subsequently
confirmed by very relevant, very trustworthy British intelligence
sources a bit later. However, far more important, still today, is the
role of Wilson in the systematic, 1967-1968 process of degrading the
economy of the U.K. into a mass of post-industrial wreckage.
Historically the most important part of Wilson's games then, was the
orchestrated monetary c aimed at a vulnerable weakness in the U.S.
dollar during 1967-1968. I have no inclination to conclude that Wilson
had been a Soviet agent during relevant times; rather, through
agreements reached through Khrushchev's representatives deployed to the
channel of Bertrand Russell's World Parliamentarians for World
Government, during the immediate post-Stalin yearsm the Soviet Union's
case exhibited a number of prominent figures who, to my reasonable
judgment, have been British agents. Who was a British defector, and who
had "gone over" to become a channel of British convenience for Russian
collaborators in high places there, has always been interesting
Kriegspiel. As one very actively concerned with establishing useful
U.S.A.-Soviet and U.S.A.-Russia relations, I have enjoyed an interesting
"catbird seat" in watching Anglo-Russian spookery. The British, by all
counts, are the dirtiest I have ever taken under consideration.
78. Respecting my use of the term "treasonous" here, consider the
exemplary cases or the U.S.A. civil war and the organically associated
installation of the fascistic-in-fact British-created, Habsburg tyranny
in Mexico. This was, in fact, a British empire's war against the United
States, in every meaning of he term "warfare." The difficulty
experienced by some governments flows from their stubborn adherence to
what are, in fact, certain delusions respecting the nature of the
British empire. An empire, such as the present-day, monetarist form of
global empire centered, politically, on London, is that its method of
warfare is that of deploying assets controlled by London, to conduct
warfare without directly involving the British flag's own military
forces in the affray. The witting patriots of a targeted nation, such
as the U.S.A. must shape its policy of practice for that occasion on
recognition that it is the British empire which has declared that
warfare, using a denial, on our side, which complements the hoax
expressed in the behavior of the United Kingdom as such. The technical
term is "war conducted as surrogate warfare," as illustrated by the role
of Prime Minister Tony Blair's lies in luring the U.S.A. into the trap
of a new war against Iraq.
79. What became know as the Wall Street to which we have been accustomed
to refer today, was the outcome of a losing battle between the
traitorous agent of the British East India Company's Aaron Burr versus
the combination centered in the persons of Alexander Hamilton and Isaac
Roosevelt, the latter the founder of the Hamiltonian tradition
expression by Isaac's famous descendant, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt. Burr was the personal asset of the Jeremy Bentham, the agent
of the British East India Company's Lord Shelburne who created the
British Foreign Office as a Company instrument in 1782. Bentham ran the
intelligence operations of the Foreign Office throughout the remainder
of his own life. It was he who directed the foreign operations against
our United States, and other targets, and who created his protégé, Lord
Palmerston, virtually out of a substance less honorable than mud. A
number of later U.S. Presidents were agents of Palmerston's Foreign
Office, as John Quincy Adams and Abraham Lincoln knew very well during
their own later years. It was a British agent, for example, who
assassinated President Lincoln, and an asset of the British interest who
was imported into the U.S.A. for the assassination of President William
McKinley. That was an assassination of McKinley intended to bring the
British asset, Theodore Roosevelt into the Presidency, for the purpose
of shifting U.S. policy from opposition to Prince of Wales Edward
Albert's scheme for what became known as "World War I," to the role of
Theodore Roosevelt and Ku Klux Klan fanatic Woodrow Wilson the ally of
the British empire, the Presidents who created the ungodly Federal
Reserve system out of a substance less honorable than mud.
80. Harry Truman had probably not known of the nuclear weaponry deployed
against Hiroshima and Nagasaki on April 13, 1945, but Winston Churchill,
Truman's later controller, did. The issue for Truman, and, most
emphatically, for Churchill, was that General Douglas MacArthur must not
be seen as carrying the flag of final victory in World War II. That, and
the intention by Churchill to deliver a mortal, nuclear threat to
Stalin, were the only credible motives for Truman's role in the
Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.
81. Lying Tony Blair now a Christian? Might we expect rats, mice, and
cockroaches will be tithing next?
82. This had been prefigured by the Seventh century B.C. maritime
alliance of Egypt, the Etruscans, and Ionian maritime culture against the

84. As we take human beings away from the customary gravitational
magnetic fields of life on the surface of our Earth, there are problems
of health to be solved. Implicitly, they can be solved by adjustments in
an intermediate environment between normal for mankind, and the "outside
environment" from which the human beings are shielded by artificial
environments; but, as of the present moment, those problems must be
attacked, and acknowledged until the solutions are defined.
