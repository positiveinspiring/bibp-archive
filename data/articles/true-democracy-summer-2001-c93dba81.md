TRUE DEMOCRACY SUMMER 2001 TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Council on Foreign Relations
and the Trilateral Commission
part 3
The Clinton Administration's Terrorism Connections
On October 11th, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick appeared
before the Council on Foreign Relations' Policy Impact Panel on Terrorism
to outline the Clinton Administration's record on combating terrorism. According
to Ms. Gorelick, the Clinton terrorism policy involves these three core elements:
* To do "everything we can to deter and to prevent terrorist
acts."
* To "respond quickly, decisively, and with a full range
of law enforcement and other options that are available."
* To "work with our friends around the world to interdict
terrorists and to assure that they do not go unpunished."
As with President Clinton's September 24th warning to drug traffickers and
terrorists that "you have no place to run, you have no place to hide," Gorelick's
election-year boilerplate is not likely to strike mortal fear into the hearts
of terrorists anywhere. Likewise, Clinton's September speech to the United
Nations declaring "zero tolerance for aggression, terrorism, and lawless
behavior" must have set new highs on global laugh meters. Let us consider
the real Clinton record on terrorism and national security.
Administration Appointments
While the problem of security risks occupying sensitive government positions
is not unique to this Administration, President Clinton has set a record
for recruiting hardcore radicals from Marxist outfits such as the terrorist-friendly
Institute for Policy Studies. Undoubtedly the full extent of this scandal
will prove to be far worse than the already frightening facts of which we
are aware. Most of the subversive iceberg remains hidden because Mr. Clinton
has not conducted the required security checks on many of his appointees.
Among the most visibly dangerous of the Clinton appointments are:
* Warren Christopher (CFR). According to this Secretary
of State, "rogue states" such as Libya, Iraq, and Iran are beyond the pale.
But terror regimes such as Russia, China, Syria, South Africa, Angola, Vietnam,
Georgia, Armenia, North Korea, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, etc., are worthy of lavish
largesse under the rubric of "engagement."
* Anthony Lake (CFR). A longtime associate of the IPS,
Lake was involved with Gelb, Halperin, Warnke, and Ellsberg in the Pentagon
Papers leak. He also worked at the IPS' Center for International Policy with
Orlando Letelier, the Chilean communist and Cuban DGI agent - just the sort
of pedigree one might expect for Mr. Clinton's Assistant for National Security
Affairs.
* Strobe Talbott (CFR). One of Bill Clinton's Oxford roommates
and fellow pilgrims to Russia, Talbott translated Khrushchev's memoirs into
a glowing English hagiography for Time magazine in 1970 - with roommate Clinton's
help. That first exercise in Soviet propaganda no doubt served well in preparing
them both for their present roles. In a July 20, 1992 Time essay entitled
"The Birth of the Global Nation," Talbott wrote that the time is quickly
approaching in which "nationhood as we know it will be obsolete; all states
will recognize a single, global authority. A phrase briefly fashionable in
the mid-20th-century - 'citizen of the world' - will have assumed real meaning...."
* Derek Shearer. Shearer is a founder of the radical Campaign
for Economic Democracy and one of the IPS network's leading apostles for
the subversive theories of Italian Communist Party strategist Antonio Gramsci.
One of his major claims to fame was the popularization of "economic democracy"
as a replacement term for the "s" word: socialism. Such creative subtlety
first earned Shearer a slot as economic adviser to the Clinton campaign and
then an ambassadorship to Denmark, where he is undoubtedly happy as a clam
living next to Mother Russia.
* Robert Borosage. An IPS director who traveled to Nicaragua
and praised the Sandinista communists, Borosage also was co-director with
Morton Halperin of the IPS' Center for National Security Studies in its subversive
attacks on police, the FBI, the CIA, and congressional investigative bodies.
Admitting that the IPS intended to "move the Democratic Party's debate internally
to the left by creating an invisible presence in the party," Borosage became
a foreign policy adviser to Jesse Jackson and then senior policy adviser
to Mr. Clinton.
[Ed's note: Antonio Gramshi was imprisoned in Italy according to one of my political science professors who did his dissertation on Antonio Gramsci, Paulo Freire, and Herbert Marcuse to successfully defend that dissertation to obtain his Ph.D. He ultimately was a tenured professor at UCLA.]
Globalist Advance
With assistance and counsel from CFR elites in key White House positions,
the Clinton Administration has openly embraced and helped legitimize some
of the most blatant terrorist nations and groups, including:
* Syria. This totalitarian dictatorship has been for many
years one of the most dangerous villains on the U.S. State Department's list
of nations engaged in state sponsored terrorism. Damascus is a veritable
Terrorists-R-Us bazaar, providing permanent residence to dozens of murderous
groups with thousands of fanatic assassins. Fronting for the Soviets, Hafez
Assad and his Al-Kassar crime network made Syria the premier narcotics trader
in the Middle East. Damascus also possesses a major chemical and biological
weapons arsenal, which Washington conveniently overlooks, even though it
makes a point of nailing less favored regimes on the same issue. No matter,
the Clinton Administration insists that Assad must be part of the phony "peace
process" and has shamelessly courted Damascus with over 30 excursions by
Warren Christopher to this ruthless, two-bit narco-terrorist prison-state.
* Iran. While continuing the illegal UN arms embargo against
Bosnia, the Administration gave its tacit approval to Iran's secret arms
shipments to Sarajevo, thus guaranteeing that Tehran's virulent, anti-U.S.
influence would infect Bosnia's Muslims. At the same time, it has done nothing
to stop Russia and China from providing Iran with nuclear reactors. Nor has
it attempted to halt Beijing's delivery of poison gas facilities, cruise
missiles, and ballistic missiles to Iran, or stop "ally" Syria from collaborating
with North Korea on new missile development.
* Northern Ireland. President Clinton has repeatedly welcomed
the Irish Republican Army's Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to the U.S. and
to the White House, even as the IRA has stepped up its terror bombings and
riots in Ireland and England. Britain's MI5 and MI6 and other Western intelligence
agencies have been tracking the travels of IRA terrorists to Iran and Libya
for years and the smuggling back to Britain and Ireland of drugs, arms, and
explosives by IRA operatives. In November 1993, IRA bosses flew to a secret
Tehran summit featuring terrorist leaders from all over the world which
was a springboard for a new global offensive. While Adams did not attend
that convocation, he has been to Tehran as an honored guest of Iran's terror
regime.
* Russia. Despite the fact that the Soviet KGB and GRU
have been for decades the premiere trainers and supporters of terrorist organizations
worldwide, the Clinton coterie and its media allies perpetuate the fatal
fantasy that Moscow has gone out of the terror business. In recent months,
Russian Foreign Minister and KGB veteran Yevgeny Primakov has been making
the rounds of the pariah states, cementing old ties he developed decades
ago as the Kremlin's Mideast terrorist paymaster. Mr. Clinton has romanced
and endorsed Yeltsin in spite of revelations that members of his government
armed and trained the Aum Shinrikyo cult for its deadly sarin gas attack
on the Tokyo subway
- W.F.J
[Ed's note: Sinn Fein wants independence for Northern Ireland from the domination and exploitation of the British government, the Prime Minister of which is a Bilderberger-Tony Blair.]

the IRA, and the Khartoum cruise missile attack.
By all means, for irrefutable documentation of US military involvement in
terrorism, visit School of the Americas Watch. An excerpt, from a
September 20, 1996 article:
US Defense Department says teaching manuals violated US policy
On September 20, the U.S. Defense Department admitted that manuals used
to train soldiers at the US Army School of the Americas at Fort Benning,
Georgia, included practices that were outlawed in the 1980s. According to
the Pentagon, the manuals suggested that informants could be controlled with
fear, beatings, truth serum, and death threats.
One manual, entitled "Handling of Sources" stated that "The counterintelligence
agent must offer presents and compensation for information leading to the
arrest, capture or death of guerrillas." Another manual, entitled "Terrorism
and the Urban Guerrilla" suggested using extortion in interrogations and
that counterintelligence agents' duties should include specifying "targets
for neutralizing."

November 19, 1997:
Maximum Sentences for Three SOA Protesters
Columbus, GA, Nov. 19 - Three members of a funeral procession that marched
onto Fort Benning, home of the notorious School of the Americas, were sentenced
today to six months in prison or "unlawful reentry," a misdemeanor. They
appeared before US Magistrate William L. Slaughter in US District Court in
Columbus, Georgia, this morning. The three were among 601 arrested on Sunday,
November 16 for participating in the commemoration of the November 16, 1989,
killing of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and her daughter, in El
Salvador. Nineteen of the 26 perpetrators of the massacre were graduates
of the School of the Americas. The protesters were attempting to deliver
hundreds of thousand of signatures calling for the closure of the SOA.
For more than 50 years, the SOA, located on the US Army base just outside
of Columbus, Georgia, has been training Latin American soldiers. Critics
maintain that the SOA trains these soldiers in the arts of torture, assassination,
and subversion. Numerous SOA graduates have been implicated in assassinations
and massacres in their home countries.
The three sentenced today - Carol Richardson, Director of SOA Watch in Washington,
DC; Anne Herman, a grandmother and advocate for the poor in Binghamton, NY;
and Richard Streb, a World War II combat veteran and retired professor of
history and education from Roanoke, VA - were also sentenced to pay fines
of $3,000 each.
The three appeared in court today with 25 others who were arrested on the
same charge. The other 25 chose to appear before a federal judge at a later
date.

Global Gorby
By: William F. Jasper
Much of the world sat glued before their television screens, eyes and ears
transfixed by the drama unfolding in a Los Angeles courtroom. The closing
arguments by Johnnie Cochran and Chris Darden in the O.J. Simpson trial held
millions in thrall.
Meanwhile, up the coast in San Francisco, an event of another sort (and
of arguably much greater consequence) was getting under way with considerably
less attention: "The State of the World Forum," a planetary confabulation
sponsored by the Gorbachev Foundation. Held atop the city's famed Nob Hill
at the luxurious Fairmont Hotel, the forum brought together a glittering
constellation of global notables representing the epitome of worldly power,
prestige, fame, wealth, and influence: presidents, princes, potentates, philanthropists,
poets, philosophers, and poohbahs.
Who's Who
The weighty seriousness and ambitious reach of the conference indicated
by the title of the event -- "Toward a New Civilization: Launching a Global
Initiative" -- were underscored by the list of attendees, a veritable Who's
Who of Wall Street, the Trilateral Commission, the World Economic Forum,
the Aspen Institute, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Club of Rome,
the Bilderbergers, the Politburo, the Commission on Global Governance, the
World Future Society, and other Insider bastions of power.
Among the 400-plus eminent personages from 50 countries who flocked to the
five-day affair (September 27th-October 1st) were former Secretaries of State
James Baker and George Shultz (both co-chairs of the forum), former President
George Bush, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, President Askar
Akaev of Kyrgystan, former President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller of Turkey, Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel, former Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and South African Vice President Thabo Mbeki.
Additional participants included: Worldwatch President Lester Brown; New
Age gurus Fritjof Capra, Jeremy Rifkin, Willis Harman, Deepak Chopra, Robert
Muller, and Matthew Fox; Marxist poetess Rigoberta Menchu; Earth Council
president and billionaire eco-warrior Maurice Strong; Microsoft wizard Bill
Gates; media mogul Rupert Murdoch; futurists Alvin Toffler and John Naisbitt;
Senator George Mitchell; Archer Daniels Midland CEO Dwayne Andreas; computer
tycoon David Packard; Esalen founder Michael Murphy; motivation superstar
Tony Robbins; Men's Wearhouse CEO George Zimmer; chimpanzee expert Jane Goodall
-- not to mention Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carl Sagan, John Denver, Shirley MacLaine,
Dennis Weaver, Ted Turner, Jane Fonda, Theodore Hesburgh,Timothy Wirth, Max
Kampleman, Milton Friedman, Randall Forsberg, Saul Mendlovitz, and Alan Cranston.
Overseeing the entirety of this summit of the anointed was, of course, Mikhail
Gorbachev himself. The purpose of the convocation, he proclaimed, was to
"launch a multi-year process, culminating in the year 2000, to articulate
the fundamental [world] priorities, values, and actions necessary to constructively
shape our common future." And who better to kick off an ostentatious extravaganza
of that sort than global media titan and former "Humanist of the Year" Ted
Turner. Identifying himself as a "great student of history" and a longtime
friend of Gorbachev, Turner praised the "ex-Communist"and former dictator
for ending the Cold War, which he acclaimed as "the greatest accomplishment
in the history of humanity." "Now, with the Cold War behind us," said Ted,
"this forum's job is to help chart the way for humanity."
Global Brain Trust
Gorbachev let it be known that he was not one to shirk from that solemn
task. Wasting no time, he opened his remarks with this magnanimous proposal:
"From the outset I would like to suggest that we consider the establishment
of a global Brain Trust to focus on the present and future of our civilization."
This is important, he said, "because the main reason why we are lagging behind
events, why we are mostly improvising and vacillating in the face of new developments,
is that we are lagging behind in the thinking and rethinking of this new
world. Of course, this idea of a Brain Trust can only succeed if endorsed
and actively pursued by people who are widely respected as world leaders
and global citizens." Respected world leaders and global citizens like --
well, like those assembled at that very same august colloquium on Nob Hill:
selfless billionaires, statesmen, academic double-domes, Nobel laureates,
and spiritual mahatmas in the service of humanity and planetary survival.
This is a theme Gorbachev has been playing in concert with similar motifs
in which he has called for "non-governmental commissions of 'wise men'" and
"Councils of Elders" to solve the world's intractable problems.
No one bothered to ask how he would reconcile the obvious contradictions
inherent in his "Brain Trust" proposal and the forum's other throbbing themes
of "democratization," "pluralism," and "egalitarianism." During the course
of the marathon palaver, Gorbachev and other conference participants regularly
attacked present political, economic, and social structures as "elitist,"
"anti-democratic," and "exclusionary," but were conspicuously vague on how
their proposed "Brain Trust" would surmount those problems. Obvious questions
went begging: Who would appoint this group? What would be its powers? How
would it be funded? What would be the selection criteria? To whom would it
be accountable? How would the "diversity" of the group be guaranteed?
The very term "Brain Trust" reeks of elitism, social engineering, and manipulation
by a cabal of experts of supposed cerebral superiority. It is an epithet
of opprobrium to all lovers of liberty who are aware of the monstrous abuses
initiated by the socialist planners of FDR's New Deal "Brain Trust": Raymond
Moley, Rexford Guy Tugwell, Lindsey Rogers, James W. Angell, Adolf Berle,
Hugh Johnson, Charles Taussig, George Peek, and others. A global "Brain Trust"
by the intellectual and spiritual heirs of these statists would mean a prescription
for global tyranny.
But drastic measures are needed, says Gorby. The traditional political structures
"no longer respond to the needs of an interdependent world. The political
culture that we inherited from the past stands in the way of efforts to unite
mankind's resources in the face of global challenges."
Mere transformation of political structures, however, is far from adequate.
"We are in dire need of redefining the parameters of our society's economic,
social, political, and spiritual development," the Soviet seer told his worshipful
votaries. "Indeed, we have to reinvent the paradigm of our existence, to build
a new civilization." It was a rehearkening to other familiar themes Gorbachev
has sung: "developing a global consciousness," "embracing the task of spiritual
renewal," launching "the next phase of human development." An awesome undertaking,
to be sure. Fortunately for us, he is graciously willing to enlighten and
minister to our darkened souls as well as our sick body politic. How does
he propose to do this? Comrade Gorbachev proposes to "set up a kind of United
Nations Council of Elders."
It was in this "Elder" capacity that Gorbachev offered the next part of
his lecture. "Civilization will shift and new values and new ways of life
will be needed to find real solutions to the problems of our environment,
a way out of the ecological crisis," the sage of Moscow told his San Francisco
gathering. Then came the punch line: "Gradually we will have to achieve a
change of emphasis in the archetypal dilemma: to have or to be; to change
the nature of consumption." "Perhaps it is a little risky in this country
to speak about that," he beamed to a titter of audience chuckles. "We have
to change the nature of consumption. And I have much to say about that here."
Compassion Con
He certainly did have much to say on the topic, as did many of the other
participants during the course of the forum. What was most amazing was that
no one gagged or guffawed at the brazen effrontery and hypocrisy of the sainted
one's sermonizing on conspicuous consumption while his rapt audience feasted
on a sumptuous array of epicurean comestibles fit for royalty: smoked trout
salad, filet of beef in shashlik marinade, and a dessert of panna cotta with
autumn fruit. This gourmet creation was the work of celebrity chef Joyce
Goldstein, and her tantalizing production was but the first of many offerings
by famed masters of gourmand haute cuisine such as Wolfgang Puck, Julian
Serrano, Joachim Splichal, and David Ribbons.
But the richness of the contradiction was no doubt lost on the pious frauds
who paid $5,000 to attend this prestigious soiree. They have grown inured
to their own fakery; from palatial palavers in Rio, to Cairo, Paris, Copenhagen,
Geneva, etc. -- they have become accustomed to the lavish amenities in which
they luxuriate, while feigning selfless pathos for the world's poor and excoriating
"hedonistic consumption" by the "middle classes" of Western industrialized
societies.
"World Citizen" Ted Turner represents the acme of this compassion con. According
to some analysts, the recently announced sale of his Turner Broadcasting
System to Time Warner could net him $2.6 billion, a tidy little sum to add
to his already bulging billions. After the forum, he and wife Jane could
fly off in their private jet, perhaps to their 40,000-acre bison barony in
Montana, or to one of their many other humble domiciles to plan still more
crusades to save the planet from the destructive consumption of the world's
troublesome riffraff.
Getting to the crux of the matter, Gorbachev pontificated: "We have to,
I believe, gear consumption more to people's cultural and spiritual needs.
Also, through culture and education and within the framework of laws we shall
have to address the problem of controlling the world's population." And control,
of course, as always, is the key word and concept here. Control. Power.
Sound like familiar drumbeats for global government? Oh no, says Gorby:
"We should not hope that the solution can come from some global center, a
kind of world government. What we need is common ground rules accepted by
the world community and observed by everyone and for that we need the international
mechanisms and the international law that is required." Meaning simply that
the "visionary" Russian is glibly proficient in the Aesopian word games employed
by the globalists to put off troublesome "isolationists" who rightfully suspect
this subversive flummery.
How else to square Gorbachev's denial with his "Churchill" speech of May
6, 1992 in Fulton, Missouri, wherein he explicitly called for "global government"
under the United Nations? Or to square it with the obvious intent of global
governmental power implicit in his repeated calls for "international mechanisms,"
"international law," and "global controls"?
Call for Global Government
The New York Times reported on September 17, 1987 that Mikhail Gorbachev
had "called for giving the United Nations expanded authority to regulate
military conflicts, economic relations, environmental protection and ...
also called for enhancing the power of the afflicted International Court
of Justice to decide international disputes." These appeals for further empowering
the UN were amplified in the Global Security Programme report published last
year by the Global Security Project of his Gorbachev Foundation.
Chairman of the board of advisers of the Gorbachev Foundation is past Senator
Alan Cranston, a past national president of the United World Federalists.
In 1949 Cranston pushed through the California legislature a resolution memorializing
Congress to call a national convention to amend the U.S. Constitution to
"expedite and insure the participation of the United States in a federal
world government." However, in a 1976 interview he advised fellow one- worlders
against mentioning world government since "the more talk about world government
the less chance of achieving it, because it frightens people who would accept
the concept of world law." Gorbachev, obviously, has heeded the advice of
this "elder statesman."
Some of the globalists slip up, however. Recent statements by James Garrison,
co-founder and president of the Gorbachev Foundation/USA, for instance, must
have caused Mr. Cranston to wince. "Over the next 20 to 30 years, we are
going to end up with world government," Garrison said in an interview in
the May 31-June 6, 1995 issue of SF Weekly, a liberal-left San Francisco
newspaper. "It's inevitable." Garrison continued: "What's happening right
now as you break down the Cold War, what is emerging now is ethnic identities.
You are going to see more Yugoslavias, more Somalias, more Rwandas, more
[Timothy] McVeighs and more nerve-gas attacks. But in and through this turbulence
is the recognition that we have to empower the United Nations and that we
have to govern and regulate human interaction...." (Emphasis added.)
But Gorbachev's dissembling over world government/world law should not surprise.
Like his treacherous use of "democracy," "pluralism," "diversity," "interdependence,"
"perestroika," "glasnost," and other globalist shibboleths, it is in full
comportment with the Communist program of dialectical deception. Consider
his conveniently flexible position on "Communism." One speaker after another
at the San Francisco forum praised the venerable aparatchik (and former General
Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) for putting an end
to Soviet Communism. Gorby himself denounced the evils of "totalitarian ideology."
"Convinced Communist"
But this is the same Gorbachev who, a few short years ago (November 1987)
proclaimed: "In October 1917, we parted with the Old World, rejecting it
once and for all. We are moving toward a new world, the world of Communism.
We shall never turn off that road." (Emphasis added.) "Perestroika," he said
then, " is a continuation of the October Revolution."
In 1989, Gorbachev declared: "I am a Communist, a convinced Communist. For
some that may be a fantasy. But for me it is my main goal." The following
year, even as he was being hailed as the "man who ended Communism," he reiterated
this conviction, stating, "I am now, just as I've always been, a convinced
Communist."
In his book Perestroika, he plainly admitted: "We are not going to change
Soviet power, of course, or abandon its fundamental principles, but we acknowledge
the need for changes that will strengthen socialism." In the same revered
text he explained that "according to Lenin, socialism and democracy are indivisible,"
and the "essence of perestroika lies in the fact that it unites socialism
with democracy and revives the Leninist concept of socialist construction
both in theory and in practice." (Emphasis added.) Thus, when he declares
for "democracy," he means "democracy" within the Leninist conception and
definition of the term, something quite the opposite of that which most Americans
assume he is talking about.
But this dialectical legerdemain does not concern George Shultz, who introduced
the royal eminence with an embarrassing gush of superlatives ("brilliant,"
"bold," "daring," "imaginative," "astonishing energy and intellectual grasp,"
"an intellect of the highest order") and anecdotes of their long "friendship."
Shultz, a member and former director of the Council on Foreign Relations,
and Gorbachev go back a long way together. In 1985 the duo signed the Soviet-American
Education Exchange Agreement negotiated by the one-world subversives at the
Carnegie Corporation. Shultz spoke with fond remembrance to the forum guests
of the "historic" 1986 Reykjavik Summit at which he and President Reagan,
together with Gorbachev and Eduard Shevardnadze, laid the groundwork for
the INF Treaty and other disarmament debacles.
For the opening "Plenary Session" of the forum, Gorbachev shared co-chair
honors with Thabo Mbeki. Mbeki, the longtime Marxist theoretician and globe-trotting
ambassador of the terrorist African National Congress, and a top member of
the South African Communist Party (SACP), was an appropriate choice. The
ANC chief said he was pleased to attend on behalf of the poor and suffering
people of Africa, who might otherwise not be represented in a "new world
order" where "the world's agenda is addressed only by the powerful."
[Ed's note: The African National Congress of which Nelson Mandela was the leader is not terrorist. It was the apartheid regime in South Africa who were the terrorists imprisoning not only Nelson Mandela for life ultimately as well as others until the divestment (another term for boycott) in companies which did business with apartheid South Africa successfully ended the apartheid in that country because Nelson Mandela was finally freed from prison at Robin's Island. Furthermore, until just this year, the southern hemisphere was not aware of the Trilateral Commission's existence as it was a North versus the southern hemisphere conception. Whether Mr. Mbeke knew of these people's real intentions is somewhat doubtful therefore.]
Mbeki, a frequent guest at the Council on Foreign Relations and other lairs
of American and European ruling elites, understands power. On July 5, 1993
Mbeki attended a dinner hosted by David Rockefeller for corporate CEOs to
raise funds for the ANC's election drive. Mbeki praised Rockefeller as a
longtime friend who "has backed the ANC financially for more than a decade."
As Nelson Mandela's heir apparent, Mbeki has been given a "moderate" image
by the ANC-friendly Insider media.
Steps to "World Order"
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, noted that
there was "something profoundly symbolic and hopeful" about the fact that
the opening session was co-chaired by Gorbachev and Mbeki. Which in itself
says a mouthful about the "worldview" of Zbig and his like-minded fellow
conferees. Burnishing his bogus anti-Communist credentials, Brzezinski denounced
the terrible record of "carnage" wrought by "Hitlerism, Leninism, Stalinism,
Maoism," and decried the monstrous deeds of the "coercive utopians."
"Yet five years after the end of the century's greatest ideological struggle
and five years before the onset of the next millennium," wailed the architect
and first director of the Trilateral Commission, "the end of the ideological
centrality in global politics has not ushered in a new world order.... We
do not have a new world order. Instead we are facing growing doubts regarding
the meaning of our era and regarding the shape of our future."
"We cannot leap into world government in one quick step," Brzezinski told
his audience, apparently ignoring Gorbachev's caution. Such a grand goal
"requires a process of gradually expanding the range of democratic cooperation
as well as the range of personal and national security, a widening, step
by step, stone by stone, [of] existing relatively narrow zones of stability
in the eventual globalization -- genuine globalization -- is progressive
regionalization, because thereby we move toward larger, more stable, more
cooperative units."
This "regionalization" is in keeping with the original Trilateral plan,
as outlined in Brzezinski's book, Between Two Ages, which called for a gradual
convergence of East and West, ultimately leading toward "the goal of world
government." In that same time, David Rockefeller's Polish protegé
proclaimed that "National sovereignty is no longer a viable concept" and
praised Marxism "in the form of Communism" as a "major advance in man's ability
to conceptualize his relationship to his world" and a "further vital and
creative stage in the maturing of man's universal vision."
NATO and the European Union must be expanded to include Russia and the former
Warsaw Pact countries, he said, and the scope of those arrangements must
be "furthered, deepened, and institutionalized." Furthermore, Brzezinski
asserted, similar structures must be crafted for the Middle East, the Far
East, and Central Asia.
Joining Brzezinski at the rostrum was astronomer and cosmic sage Carl Sagan,
who warned (predictably) that humanity faces "an absolutely new, unprecedented
series of threats to the global environment that sustains us all." These
"crises" include (of course) "depletion of the protective ozone layer and
global warming through the increasing greenhouse effect...."
Yawn. Same tired, old, toxic eco-drivel. But wait! -- there is an exciting
new "crisis": asteroids, which are certain to collide with earth in the not-too-distant
future. This threat is "necessarily a problem for the whole species" and
one in which we will have to join in collective action (presumably through
the UN) to solve.
All of these crises show that we must begin to view the planet from the
astronauts' perspective, says Sagan: "There are no national boundaries in
that perspective. It is only one integrated, whole planet, all parts of which
rise and fall together."
The "New Paradigm"
John Naisbitt, futurist, techno-savant, adviser to corporate titans and
world leaders, and member of the board of advisers of the Gorbachev Foundation,
was more upbeat. The author of the mega- blockbusters Megatrends, Megatrends
2000, Megatrends for Women, and Global Paradox prefaced his remarks by stating
his commitment to "free markets and free trade." But like the rest of his
colloquium colleagues, he emphasized the need for everyone to adopt a "new
vocabulary," "new concepts," and a new "worldview" if we are going to understand
the "new paradigm" the world has entered.
This "new paradigm," naturally, requires "new leadership" -- leaders who
will lead by "moral authority." "My candidate for what a new leader would
be like," said Naisbitt, "is Vaclav Havel." Mr. Havel, the celebrated socialist
playwright and president of the Czech Republic, of course, also talks of
"free markets" -- while installing unreconstructed and unrepentant Communists
such as Alexander Dubcek in the top positions of power in his government.
Another of his favorite new leaders, said Naisbitt, is Nelson Mandela. Colin
Powell is yet another, and Naisbitt criticized those who ask where Powell
stands on the issues or what he would do concerning this matter or that:
"The point is not what is Powell going to do; the point is who is he going
to be. The new leadership is shifting away from being in charge to moral
authority, responsibility, and inspiration." You see, in the "new paradigm,"
you need only be dazzled by the "moral authority" oozing from the persona
created by the elite media image makers. We have apparently entered the age
of ontological politics -- the politics of "being."
"The New Architecture of Global Security and Paths to Building a Civic Society
(The Global Age)" was the title of a presentation by Kassa Kebede, a member
of the board of directors of the Gorbachev Foundation and an active participant
in the Foundation's Global Security Project. Kebede is a former ambassador
to the United Nations and was Foreign Secretary during the 1980s for the
murderous and genocidal Communist regime of Haile Mengistu in Ethiopia. "The
globalization of the challenges confronting us will certainly affect the
traditional concept of sovereignty," Kebede told the attendees. Indeed. Echoing
the Kennedy Administration's treasonous 1961 Freedom From War proposal to
transfer U.S. armaments to the UN, Kebede's disarmament plan calls for "storage
of the warheads and of the delivery systems in separate places under international
control."
The Ethiopian commissar also commended the proposition put forward in Our
Global Neighborhood: The Report of the Commission on Global Governance* to
create "a standing force of 10,000 soldiers under the authority of the Security
Council." This in spite of the fact that the UN's present "peacekeeping"
operations, as Kebede himself admits, are already vastly "overextended,"
with "more than 70,000 personnel, and costs of over $3.5 billion."
NOTE: See the April 3, 1995 issue of The New American, page 5
Kebede parroted the Global Security Programme and Zbigniew Brzezinski in
calling for establishing regional "security" (i.e. war-making) organizations
similar to NATO "in the Middle East, South Asia and North East Asia."
Joining the Mikhail/Zbigniew Doublespeak Chorus, Kebede chirped: "The commonality
of goals, and shared values of global ethics, produce justification for world
governance. This concept is in no way an alteration of national sovereignty,
and does not lead to world government."
Although the state of the world's political, economic, and social ills came
in for thorough treatment at the forum, it was in the area of global spiritual
enlightenment that the gathering blossomed into full flower. Leading the
cosmic charge were a host of the reigning Brahmins of New Age bliss, including
Willis Harman, Barbara Marx Hubbard, Richard Baker, Matthew Fox, Shirley
MacLaine, Deepak Chopra, Fritjof Capra, and Rupert Sheldrake.
[Ed's note: In my humble opinion, Deepak Chopra is a humanitarian.]
Willis Harman, New Age philosopher, president of the Institute of Noetic
Sciences, and author of Global Mind Change and The New Metaphysical Foundation
of Modern Science, has had a profound effect on our society in the past couple
of decades. In "Our Hopeful Future: Creating a Sustainable Society," one
of his new essays distributed at the forum, Harman reported, "Around the
world one detects murmurings that industrialized and 'developing' countries
alike have a need for a new social order -- that, in fact, the situation
calls for a worldwide systemic change." Really? Have you heard such "murmurings"
in your neighborhood? Not likely - - unless your neighborhood is home to
some of Harman's murmurous disciples.
Evolutionary Process
These murmurers, who comprise "an expanding fraction of the populace," perceive
"a shifting underlying picture of reality." They see "the connectedness of
everything to everything" and place "emphasis on intuition and the assumption
of inner divinity." These adepts of the "new spirituality" share a "commitment
to global change." Their "New Order," says Harman, is characterized by "an
emphasis not on goals but on process ... the process is an evolutionary one,
and the goals are emergent." The message is: Don't question where I am taking
you, just start moving. And trust me; I'm doing what's good for you.
"Interconnectedness" is the overarching theme also preached by biologist
Rupert Sheldrake, a Theosophist who posits that a "morphogenic field" --
an invisible matrix or organizing field that connects all life and thought
on earth -- holds the keys to our existence and to the "Ageless Wisdom."
Fritjof Capra, physicist and systems theorist, New Age swami, and author
of the international best-sellers Uncommon Wisdom, The Turning Point, and
The Tao of Physics, provided a similar message. "The Elmwood Institute, which
Capra founded in Berkeley, California, sees that none of the major problems
of our time can be understood in isolation," write New Age political activists
Corinne McLaughlin and Gordon Davidson in Spiritual Politics: Changing the
World From the Inside Out. "A systems approach is needed, as all our problems
are interconnected and interdependent, facets of one single crisis -- essentially
a crisis of perception. This crisis is part of a cultural shift from a mechanistic
worldview to a holistic and ecological view, from a value system based on
domination to partnership, from quantity to quality, from expansion to conservation,
from efficiency to sustainability."
A Capra essay, "The Turning of the Tide," was included in the Fall 1993
issue of ReVision: A Journal of Consciousness and Transformation, which was
part of the free literature made available to the forum participants. In
it Capra writes:
"The view of man as dominating nature and woman, and the belief in the superior
role of the rational mind, have been supported and encouraged by the Judaeo-Christian
tradition, which adheres to the image of a male god, personification of supreme
reason and source of ultimate power, who rules the world from above by imposing
his divine law on it. The laws of nature searched for by the scientists were
seen as reflections of this divine law, originating in the mind of God."
This traditional Judaeo-Christian-influenced thinking, says Capra, "has
led to attitudes that are profoundly antiecological. In truth, the understanding
of ecosystems is hindered by the very nature of the rational mind. Rational
thinking is linear, whereas ecological awareness arises from an intuition
of nonlinear systems." Capra celebrates Eastern mysticism as a superior spiritual
path, while applauding the "inevitable decline of patriarchy," the demise
of "fixed ideas and rigid patterns of behavior," and the rise of the feminist
and ecological movements.
Barbara Marx Hubbard, author of The Book of Co-Creation, claims in her curricula
vitae to be "establishing Evolutionary Circles throughout the world to support
small groups in their emergence as universal humans, founders of a global
civilization." Hubbard was an organizer of the 1988 Soviet-American Citizens'
Summit in Alexandria, Virginia, coordinated with the Soviet Peace Committee,
a creature of the Soviet Central Committee's International Department established
by Stalin to carry out penetration and subversion of foreign countries. Hubbard
is also a former director of the Federal Union, founded by Fabian Socialist
Rhodes Scholar Clarence Streit.
As a psychologist with Task Force Delta, an army think tank of futurists,
strategists, and psychology and parapsychology researchers, Hubbard is credited
with the idea of "bombarding" the Soviets with "psychic love," and formation
of the First Earth Battalion (FEB). The credo of the FEB "guerilla gurus"
states: "I take personal responsibility for generating evolutionary conspiracies
as a part of my work. I will select and create conspiratorial mechanisms
... that will create and perform evolutionary breakthrough actions on behalf
of people and planet. One people, one planet."
But according to these cognoscenti, there are too many people on this "one
planet." Willis Harman's essay grapples with the "dilemma.": "In the economy-dominated
world, as the outspoken anthropologist Margaret Mead once put it bluntly,
'The unadorned truth is that we do not need now, and will not need later,
much of the marginal labor -- the very young, the very old, the very uneducated,
and the very stupid.'" "This dilemma is perhaps the most basic one we face,"
said Harman. Society can't afford "from an environmental standpoint, or from
the standpoint of tearing apart of the social fabric -- the economic growth
that would be necessary to provide jobs for all in the conventional sense,
and the inequities which have come to accompany that growth. This dilemma,
more than any other aspect of our current situation, indicates how fundamental
a system change is now required."
In the closing plenary session of the forum, philosopher/author Sam Keen
summarized the consensus of the learned ones. Among the conference participants,
said Keen, "there was very strong agreement that religious institutions have
to take primary responsibility for the population explosion. We must speak
far more clearly about sexuality, about contraception, about abortion, about
the values that control the population, because the ecological crisis, in
short, is the population crisis. Cut the [world's] population by 90 percent
and there aren't enough people left to do a great deal of ecological damage."
How do we "cut" the planet's population by 90 percent? Even genocidal mass
murderers Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, and Mao combined did not come close to attaining
such a "lofty" goal. As always, the devil is in the details. Forum participant
Barbara Marx Hubbard may already have provided some of the devilish answer.
In The Book of Co-Creation she writes: "Out of the full spectrum of human
personality, one-fourth is electing to transcend.... One-fourth is destructive
[and] they are defective seeds. In the past they were permitted to die a
'natural death.'... Now as we approach the quantum shift from the creature-human
to the co-creative human -- the human who is an inheritor of god-like powers
-- the destructive one-fourth must be eliminated from the social body....
Fortunately, you are not responsible for this act. We are. We are in charge
of God's selection process for planet Earth. He selects, we destroy. We are
the riders of the pale horse, Death."
Lord help us all if this de facto "Brain Trust" of diabolical misfits, murderers,
megalomaniacs, terrorists, and tyrants succeed in establishing their "new
world order," their "new global civilization."
