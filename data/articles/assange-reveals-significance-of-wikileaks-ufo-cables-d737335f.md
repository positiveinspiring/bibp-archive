In the first of a series of "Live People's
Conferences" where Julian Assange directly responds to public questions
about Wikileaks, he has clarified the nature of most UFO references in its
yet-to-be-published diplomatic cables.
Back on December 3, 2010, Assange raised
expectations when he said in an
interview in the Guardian newspaper that,
"it is worth noting that in
yet-to-be-published parts of the cablegate archive there are indeed
references to UFOs."
This led to many wondering whether an alleged
U.S. government cover-up of UFOs and extraterrestrial life was going to be
finally exposed.
Indeed, one of the
diplomatic cables released by
the Norwegian newspaper, Aftenposten, referred to extensive funding for UFO
research in the former Soviet Union.
In his February 6 response to a
question about UFOs, Assange revealed that the contents of the
yet-to-be-published diplomatic cables largely dealt with the Raelian UFO
cult and its claims of cloning.
In response to a question about releasing cables concerning UFOs,
Assange
said:
I have said in passing there is information
about UFOs in Cablegate. And that is true, but these are only small
passing references. Most of the material concerns UFO cults, and their
behavior in recruiting people.
For instance, there is quite a large cable,
which we'll try and release in the next few days, concerning the
Raelians (see below insert), a UFO cult which has a strong presence in Canada and was of
concern to the U.S. ambassador in Canada.
At that time, the Raelians claimed to have
cloned an individual, and fantastically, the press all around the world
ate this up and turned it into front page stories.
The cable in question, yet to be published by
Wikileaks itself as Assange said, in fact was released by the Norwegian
newspaper, Aftenposten (below insert) on January 4, 2011.
It details the extent of U.S. concerns about the Raelian UFO cult, its cloning claims, and recruiting
activities.
The cable describes for example, Rael's beliefs about the
creation of humanity by extraterrestrials:
EARTHLINGS HAD BEEN CREATED IN A LABORATORY 25,000 YEARS AGO.
SINCE THESE ALIENS WHICH HE CALLS
THE ELOHIM
(THE HEBREW WORD FOR GOD) ARE 25,000 YEARS
AHEAD OF US, RAEL SAYS CLONING IS VERY SIMPLE TASK FOR THEM
IN THE
MEANTIME, RAEL WANTS TO BUILD AN EMBASSY IN ISRAEL TO WELCOME THE ELOHIM
WHEN THEY COME BACK IN 2035.
The diplomatic cable focuses on the possibility that the Raelians would use
their cloning claims to recruit adherents in the U.S.
After reviewing some
of the beliefs of the Raelian's founder, Rael, the cable went on to
conclude:
THE PUBLICITY GARNERED BY THE CLONING ANNOUNCEMENT MAY BE USED BY THE RAEL
ORGANIZATION TO GAIN NEW ADHERENTS IN THE UNITED STATES.
Assange's response lays to rest some of the rampart speculation about the
extent of UFO reports in Wikileaks cables.
For example, Michael Cohen from
AllnewsWeb claimed on January 17:
A source from within the inner circle of the Wikileaks team has
confidentially leaked to All News Web the content of a State Dept cable,
concerning UFO affairs, that Wikileaks has declined to upload onto their
website.
The cable states:
"It is critical all embassy staff understand that
they are not to discuss under any circumstance concerns DOD has with UFOs
entering orbit, once again the seriousness of this matter cannot be
overstated."
According to Assange's interview, it is safe to conclude that no such
diplomatic cable exists of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) being
concerned about UFOs entering earth's orbit; or, at least, is not part of
the diplomatic cables held by Wikileaks.
If UFOs are a major headache for
the DOD, as in fact evidence suggests is the case, then this would certainly
be more highly classified than the Secret and Confidential files possessed
by Wikileaks.
According to researcher Timothy Good, such information is
classified above Top Secret with "Need to Know" special access.
Similarly, a report in the
European Union Times on December 13 (2010) revealed what
its alleged confidential sources were saying were going to be released by Wikileaks:
A new report circulating in the Kremlin today prepared for President
Medvedev by Russian Space Forces (VKS) 45th Division of Space Control says
that an upcoming WikiLeaks release of secret US cables details that the
Americans have been "engaged" since 2004 in a "war" against UFO's based on
or near the Continent of
Antarctica, particularly the Southern Ocean.
Again, it can be concluded from Assange's "Live People's Conference" that no
such references to a secret UFO war exists in the diplomatic cables held by
Wikileaks.
It appears that if smoking gun documentary evidence of a government cover-up
of
UFOs and
extraterrestrial life exists, such evidence has not yet come
into the possession of Wikileaks.
What can be expected in the weeks or
months ahead for Wikileaks is the release of files documenting extensive UFO
research by the former Soviet Union (already released by Aftenposten), and
perhaps more references to public officials around the world interested in
UFOs. None of the UFO references, according to Julian Assange, are of
special significance and amount to little more than "small passing
references."
So the wait continues for the release of documentation
revealing the true extent of U.S. and international government knowledge of
UFOs and extraterrestrial life.
