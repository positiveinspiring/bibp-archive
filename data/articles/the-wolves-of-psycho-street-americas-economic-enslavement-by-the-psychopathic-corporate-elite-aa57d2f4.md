Is it only me or is there something fundamentally flawed with the people who
are running our government, including the autocrats, technocrats and
bureaucrats who number in the hundreds of thousands.
Does it bother you that,
...have their needs met at the expense
of everyone else?
They control our government. We don't. Instead we fear our
government.
They tell us,
"Trust us. We know what to do and how to fix
all of our crises."
Okay we trust you.
They say we are for peace, democracy and
freedom. But everywhere we look they are colonizing and militarizing foreign
countries with over 960 military bases with a budget of 1.6 trillion going
to numerous corporations to keep American imperialism afloat.
At the same
time, there have been massive home foreclosures, repossessions, for-profit
prisons stuffed to the brim with inmates for minor crimes, and the now
reappearance of debtor prisons in 27 states. We are graduating students who
are functionally illiterate.
They say trust us, unemployment has decreased to 6.7 percent. And we say
that the real number is 24 percent due to the millions who no longer receive
compensation and have stopped looking for work.
They say lower taxes. We say why don't you pay what you owe instead of
getting accountants to fudge the numbers in order to pay zero tax.
They say
that the economy is booming and the stock market is reaching record numbers.
We say is that because you are loaning to small businesses? Is that because
you are helping new companies to jumpstart manufacturing again in the U.S., or
is it because you can go to the fed to be bailed out at zero interest?
They say trust us, we need more law and order.
And yet, private banks and
corporations have been fined tens of billions of dollars for being serial
repeaters crimes and never go to jail. On the other hand the average person
gets caught jaywalking and can be thrown into the slammer.
They say they are uncertain whether or not
global warming is real. And we
say we have had 120,000 extreme weather events globally in the past year and
the scientific consensus around the world is that global warming is very
real and a global threat to humanity's future.
They say they believe in protecting our rights for our freedom of speech,
but then our government monitors anyone who is critical of Washington policy
and major corporations. They say we need Obamacare. We say there is nothing
in Obamacare to prevent disease nor any provisions to enhance a person's
survival if they have a disease.
The U.S. is the sickest developed nation in
the world and the pharmaceutical giants and insurance companies are
perfectly happy to keep it that way.
They say we should not have rules that limit globalization nor hinder free
market casino capitalism. And we say look at NAFTA, the outsourcing of jobs
overseas, which collapsed American industry, and the ghettoization of
America's cities like Detroit, Compton and Camden.
They say we should not
give welfare to the lazy and nothing should be socialized. We say major
corporations reap 200-300 billion a year in corporate welfare. When they
succeed citizens don't share in the profits. When they fail we are forced to
pay for their ineptitude.
They encourage us to watch television and shop because it is good for people
and the economy. And we say our life is more substantial than a reality
show. And why is there no honest effort by the media to know what it means
to be a person suffering today.
They say, we are doing everything for your
benefit; however when whistleblowers come forward they are immediately
demonized and prosecuted.
We are bothered by this and much more, because behind all the corruption,
lies and deception there is no viable solution to the nation's increasing
economic disparity and the rise in unemployment, poverty and depression.
Our education policy makers welcome us to their institutions. They convince
us they will help our children master the art of critical thinking so they
will be more empowered to live authentic, constructive and meaningful lives.
Yet to the contrary their expertise has been limited solely to teaching
children
how to take exams and behave as programmed robots.
Many of our
educational leaders refuse to join protests over the takeover of schools by
immoral business privatizers, which goes to show academia is nothing more
than a handmaiden of the corporate industrial complex.
Our leaders tell us that they want the nation to be energy independent and
this can be done safely and efficiently while also addressing the increasing
challenges of climate change and global warming. And we trust them.
But to
the contrary their cards have been stacked to abet the fossil fuel moguls
and hydrofrackers who without remorse contaminate and destroy the
environment while depleting precious water resources upon which communities
depend. And then even in the aftermath
of Fukushima, we are told believe
that nuclear power is a clean, safe and green alternative.
We constantly hear from our politicians that the U.S. is the greatest
democracy in the world and they are fully devoted to keep it as a "shining
light on a hill." But then, as we have learned from
Edward Snowden and other
courageous whistleblowers, none of the politicians trust the American
people.
Otherwise there would be no incentive or reason to conduct massive
covert spying and surveillance on every aspect of our lives. As well as
militarize the police to assure that demonstrators are dealt with the needs
of Big Business and Big Government
They tell us we have medical freedom of choice. But if we don't want to
treat our children who suffer from cancer with their
toxic chemotherapy
drugs and radiation, they take the children
away.
And, where is the choice in declining a vaccine when state
governments
mandate vaccination in our school systems?
After they tell us we have a bill of rights and our Constitutional rights
are protected, they then turn around and take away habeas corpus which
allows them to search and seize anything they want. In addition they can
harass and arrest those who they fear.
The media repeatedly claims it is fair and balanced; yet all of their guests
and so-called experts are corporate propagandists whether from think tanks,
foundations or academia.
They tell us we are the wealthiest and most financially stable country in
the world. The nation has a $15 trillion GDP. However against that there are
exponential amounts of debt including
$17 trillion to the federal debt, $6 trillion for state debt, $125 trillion
for corporate debt, $10-15 trillion for personal debt, about a trillion each
for credit card and student loan debt as well as unfunded liabilities at
over $128 trillion.
So our real total debt is over $293 trillion.
In effect,
the U.S. is worse off than Greece or Spain. In fact, the U.S. is virtually
bankrupt as the most indebted nation on the planet.
We were repeatedly being told that an
Obama presidency would be the most
open, transparent administration in presidential history. However,
everything in this White House has been the exact opposite, with more
documents being classified secret than any other administration.
Increasingly the administration has stripped away government from the people
and handed it over to a corporate oligarchy.
-
Is the problem, therefore, we the people?
-
Are we at fault for having been
seduced by those in power to sell us blank bill of goods, drugs, products
and policies that are more harmful than beneficial?
-
Are we at fault for
having deceived ourselves by being convinced that their illusion is the
truth?
-
Or is the elite, the best and brightest in Wall Street, Washington
and throughout
the top stories of the multinational corporate networks, the real obstacle
to a promising future for all?
-
Are the oligarchic elite, including corporate
Democrats and corporate
Republicans in all branches of government, not in fact a special
breed of
psychopath with no
moral compass, striving solely to maintain their power, control and wealth?
In this article we explore this phenomena with two leading experts on the
psychopathic nature of our CEOs, business leaders and politicians who rule
America from their residences on Psycho Street.
Several decades ago, finding an individual with strong psychopathic
characteristics serving in an executive function at a major Wall Street bank
or multinational corporation would have been almost unheard of.
During the
Great Generation following the Second World War, most people's entire
careers were often with a single company or firm.
They climbed through the
ranks based upon seniority and time spent at the firm. Because corporations
and banks were more stable then, it was therefore incumbent that business
leaders be psychological stable as well.
Today that has all changed. Given the dramatic deviations within high
finance and large corporations, the business culture and ethics have
degenerated and given way to a landscape of classical psychological
derangement.
The advent of radical deregulation, the rise of our present
free market and the neoliberal capitalist paradigm has made way for a new
dominant economic system that is fundamentally amoral, as Jerry Mander has
elaborated upon in The Capitalism Papers: Fatal Flaws of an Obsolete System.
Within an amoral system we would expect to find chairmen, CEOs and
executives who are also amoral and callous about the financial decisions and
policies they make and that consequently have a profound deleterious impact
on the lives of others.
Several studies investigating the psychopathic nature of our private
industrial and financial systems and the executives leading these
institutions have shed light on the underlying causes of our national
economic woes during the past five presidential administrations. Percentage
estimates of high level corporate executives who can be clinically diagnosed
as psychopathic
vary.
Psychopathology for the general population is approximately one
percent.
However, among the wealthy and power elites, estimates range
between four percent (Dr. Robert Hare, an expert in criminal psychology at
the University of British Columbia) to ten percent (Sherri DeCoveny, a
former investment banker now researching psychological disturbances in the
finance community).
Welsh journalist Jon Ronson, author of the bestseller
The Psychopath Test, claims the percentage is even higher.
Psychologist
Clive Boddy at the Nottingham University has devoted his research to
studying corporate psychopaths. In his book Corporate Psychopaths As
Organizational Destroyers, Boddy argues that it was the psychopathic
behavior of
the global and financial elite that brought about
the economic collapse in
2008.
His research also indicates that those with the most psychopathic
tendencies are promoted fastest through the corporate ranks. And it is well
known that the risks for crime and illegal activity is far greater among
psychopaths than the general population.
Investigations into many companies, such as,
-
Enron
-
Goldman Sachs
-
Lehman
Brothers
-
AIG
-
JP Morgan
-
Freddie and Fannie
-
MF Global
-
HSBC Bank,
...and
others, have uncovered widespread, systemic crime.
In a survey of 500 senior
executives in the U.S. and UK, 26 percent observed firsthand wrongdoing in the
workplace, and one in four believed it was necessary for professionals in
the financial sector to engage in unethical and illegal conduct in order to
be successful.
Sixteen percent stated they would commit insider trading if
they were certain they could get away with it, and 30 percent said that the
pressures to maximize on compensation plans were an incentive to break the
law. These statistics provide evidence to just how deeply ingrained
psychopathic qualities have become institutionalized in our financial
industry.
They validate the former Goldman Sachs employee,
Greg Smith, who
has written and spoken publicly about the disturbing psychological
characteristics among his colleagues.
And wasn't it Goldman Sachs' Chairman
Lloyd Blankfein who rhetorically asked an interviewer with the London Times,
"Is it possible to have too much ambition?
Is it possible to be too successful?"
Blankfein has publicly stated he doesn't believe there are or
should be caps on either personal ambition or compensation and reward for
personal ambition.
So when a study conducted by Vanderbilt University finds that psychopaths
frequently have an abnormality in their neurochemical dopamine levels, which
contributes to a narcissistic drive for personal reward at any cost and to
engage willingly in risky behavior that benefits themselves while injuring
others, we can better understand why unlawful conduct is commonplace among
high powered traders, fund managers and their executive bosses
Dr. Christopher Bayer is a psychoanalyst who has earned the title of the
Wall Street Psychologist after thirty years counseling and treating
financial executives, CEOs, venture capitalists, hedge fund execs, traders,
Wall Street lawyers and their families in Manhattan.
He is intimately aware
of the self-destructive and devastating psychological damage being caused by
those deeply immersed in high finance culture, and is blunt about the
epidemic of psychopathic personalities running throughout America's
corporations and firms.
During a conversation with Dr. Bayer, he noted that
psychopaths lack the capacity to experience empathy.
"They don't experience
guilt. They don't experience anxiety. They are driven, hyper vigilant and on
Wall Street most of it is about power and control."
He estimates that among
his Wall Street clients, this is the norm.
"It's about seduction. Show me the money.
It's the opiate of western culture and this is what I glean from my
patients."
"The people I work with basically say to me, Let them catch us if they can.
We have enough money to legally draw out for ten or twenty years anything
the government does to us.' It's a war of attrition, and the Bernie Madoff
caper is a good example."
"The 2008 subprime crisis, based on the
people I work with, was totally predictable. John Paulson made 15
billion dollars because of that crisis. Totally predictable and it's all
self-serving. The issue of sustainability, righteousness and virtue is
not considered."
The Vice President of the National Association of Chiefs of Police,
Jim
Corey, collected data on personality traits common to specific professions,
primarily looking at superficial charm, an exaggerated sense of self-worth,
glibness and lying, lack of remorse, and manipulation of
others.
These are common traits of psychopathic killers, but Corey also
found them common among many politicians.
The problem that arises is whether
or not the entire system within which private corporate industries and our
federal government function and progress is now programmed to be
psychopathic.
Has corporate culture now de-evolved to such a degree where
psychopathology has been legalized and above the law?
Today it is not so much that people believe our CEOs and politicians act
without empathy or compassion regarding the well-being of average citizens,
especially towards those in dire poverty, but rather whether or not our
entire system is psychologically deranged.
Psychopathology has become fully
institutionalized as a legitimate way of doing business and making policy
decisions.
The Supreme Court decision on Citizens United, which ruled that
corporations and banks are "persons," was a further step infecting our
entire politics and society with a serious mental disorder that has steadily
contributed to the U.S.'s widening inequality gap, class struggle, and
Americans' loss of democracy and freedom of speech.
Joel Bakan is an internationally recognized legal scholar at the University
of British Columbia specializing in Constitutional and economic law. The
award-winning documentary film
The Corporation was based upon his bestseller
The Corporation - The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power.
When I last
spoke with Professor Bakan, I asked him about the kind of corporate
personality the Supreme Court ruled in favor of.
"The corporation," he said, "is legally
programmed to always serve its own interests. Its directors and managers
have a legal obligation always to put the financial interests of
shareholders above all other interests. It breaks the law with impunity
if it can get away with it."
The problem lies less in the fact that Wall
Street and
multinational presidents and CEOs are psychopaths.
Rather according to Bakan,
"we've
created an institution that attracts psychopaths and that incentivizes
psychopathic behavior."
If we can imagine putting JP Morgan or
Monsanto on
the shrink's couch, analyze the way these firms think and function, how they
are programmed, they would be diagnosed as psychopathic.
Bakan believes this
is the current
state of private industry.
A bank's collective control and power is
unfathomable to the average person. Executives believe they are untouchable
and their astronomical wealth enables them to act with complete freedom and
without regard for the consequences of their actions.
Dr. Bayer takes these firms' socio-political dominance further.
"Corporations existentially are like feudal fiefdoms," he said.
"They are countries with regulations and
laws unto their selves. International corporations can commit crimes and
do certain things, and then relocate their headquarters and be off the
hook in terms of legality, extradition, and penalty."
Back in the late 19th century, large industries, such as the railroad and
telegraphy companies, discovered that being thoroughly self-centered was an
effective way to raise huge capital to expand and further develop
productivity.
However, to keep the industrial moguls such as the
Rockefellers and Carnegies within bounds, the government instituted a
regulatory system.
Joel Bakan explained that this was a way to,
"hedge it in by all the different laws that
ensure that these industries don't overrun public interest in having a
health society, clean environment, and human and workers' rights."
With the election of Ronald Reagan, the regulatory system began to be
dismantled while leaving the inherent psychopathology of these corporations
not rehabilitated.
When
Glass-Steagall was repealed and the Future
Commodities Trading act was approved under
Bill Clinton by psychopathic
financial giants in his administration,
"we basically let the psychopath off
its leash," says Bakan. "We've let it run amok. We've taken away all the
constraints that were in place."
The illusion that deregulation would
improve the economy from the top down is as irrational as giving a crack
addict more cocaine to reduce his habit. Now Wall Street firms and large
corporations can essentially self-regulate, which is the same as saying
there is no regulation at all.
Bakan poses the question,
"would you ever ask
a psychopath to self-regulate himself?"
But that is exactly what we have
today and the consequences are self-evident as we witness the erosion of
Constitutional rights and the emergence of a distinctly postmodern
police state indoctrinated to protect corporate interests over the needs and
demands of the American public.
The idea that Wall Street and policy experts surrounding the president are
among the "best and brightest" in America is a deceptive ruse of propaganda
spin.
When Dr. Bayer applies his evaluative model to his Wall Street
patients, the bottom line is that the revenues they generate and who they
succeed in influencing in order to protect the firm's interests is all that
matters. The prestige of a person's alma mater, ZIP code and family
background is of little consequence.
Speaking about Manhattan's financial
community, he described it as,
"an insane den of elitism and money
mongrels, frankly, and people are competitive and actually believe they
are special."
The TARP and subsequent taxpayer bailouts of the banking industry during the
Bush and
Obama administrations may be one of the largest economic crimes
ever committed by American presidents.
These bailouts are indicative of just
how dysfunctional and subservient to the power elite our nation has become.
Since the 2008 derivative collapse, the economic gap has steadily widened
and the middle class is sinking to its lowest point in history.
British epidemiologists Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson have shown that
there is a strong correlation between a nation's unhealthy obsession with
economic growth and swelling inequality.
This in turn has led to a cascade
of social crises, increasing the incidence of scourges including mental
illness, violence, addictions and much more. And it has been the richer
countries, particularly the U.S., which have been overrun by an oligarchic,
corporate elite who believe austerity is a solution towards economic
stability.
Joel Bakan holds the view that,
"Societies that have large disparities and
inequalities of wealth are societies that quickly become dysfunctional.
There is a pathology behind inequality; that is, when people have the
power of wealth they don't feel the necessity of being tied to
community.
And when they don't feel that necessity,
they lose their natural sense of empathy, which I think in a way is a
survival sense."
"In part, we're empathetic," Prof. Bakan continued,
"because we understand that we may be in a bad position some day. We may
be diving in dumpsters. So we need to create a society that ensures that
people aren't diving in dumpsters and that when people fall through the
cracks, they're protected because we may be there some day."
"But when you're very rich and powerful,
you don't believe you may be there; so, it makes sense that you would
lack that sense of empathy. And when you look at the austerity measures
in Europe and increasingly in North America as well, the morality behind
it is disgusting."
What is even worse is that these same psychopathic corporatists serve as the
primary advisors to the President and elected officials.
At the state level,
the GOP aligns readily with the Koch Brothers, perhaps two of the most
ideologically fanatical individuals in the U.S.'s billionaire club. The same
can be said for many of the advisors who revolve through the circular door
between Washington and Wall Street.
Several years ago I interviewed and filmed Jordan Belfort, the former stock
trader portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie The Wolf of Wall Street.
Belfort spoke about the insanity behind the lack of ethical decisions
rampant throughout the financial industry and the instant gratification of a
select elite who are willing to destroy everything for short term profits in
order to accumulate massive amounts of wealth.
Belfort shared one noteworthy
example: the former Treasury Secretary Robert Ruben who,
"lobbied to ease
limits on derivatives and was instrumental in getting derivatives traded on
Wall Street in an aggressive way."
What does Ruben do after completing his
stint as a politician in Clinton's administration?
"When no longer Secretary
of Treasury," Belfort continues, "he goes down to Wall Street, gets on the
board of Citibank, convinces them to plunge head first into these
derivatives that he just deregulated and makes $500 million by most
accounts. And then he bankrupts what was once the largest bank in the
world."
To this day government officials have not made any effort to
investigate and indict Ruben for reckless, unconscionable behavior. His
foolhardy acts have devastated the
livelihoods of countless people. A common psychopathic criminal would be
placed behind bars immediately for far less misconducts than Ruben and his
Wall Street cronies.
The sickness behind the entire system is that it rewards such behavior and
patronizes the ability to create power and wealth rather giving preference
to efforts that raise the standards of living for everyone, in particular
those who have minimal opportunities for social progress without the
assistance and protection from government.
However, the problem is more
systemically entrenched than simply having a bunch of psychopathic
personalities sitting in high executive positions.
Joel Bakan has explained
that,
"the problem is not so much that we allow people to get away with
breaking the law. It's that we create laws that allow people to get away
with doing things that are horrific. And what I mean by that is that it
takes us back to the issue of how deregulation combines with the law of the
corporation.
The law of the corporation basically says it is your legal duty
to exploit and to plunder in order to create wealth for your shareholders.
The law of the regulatory state used to say,
'but you can't do this or
that'. It no longer says that. So, in effect, what used to be illegal
behavior that is certainly morally wrong, whether it meant creating
unsafe environments for workers, creating an unsafe factory or insider
trading are no longer illegal."
"It is law and order for poor
people who might steal a popsicle from a corner store. Three strikes and
you're out. But for corporations, the legal restraints on their
activities have been diminishing rapidly since the 1980's, and our
entire political culture is hostile to the notion that government should
regulate corporations with well enforced laws."
Former investment banker Sherree DeCovney has stated that she has,
"come to
know many psychopaths, from Ponzi-schemers to book-cooking corporate
executives. They are always charming and narcissistic. They display
wonderful glib senses of humor and spin the truth like a roulette wheel."
Clive Boddy explains that psychopaths,
"take advantage of the relative
chaotic nature of the modern corporation."
Under these circumstances they
are able to clothe themselves in a veneer of charm which makes "their
behavior invisible."
They are able to take
full advantage of circumstances for their firms and personal
self-aggrandizement while simultaneously feeling no remorse over the
consequences of their decisions and consistently deny any personal
responsibility for how damaging their acts may have been.
An aura of charm and charisma is one distinguishing trait corporate
psychopaths have in common - think,
Likewise, firms' public
relations arms re-imagine corporations in a glowing, positive light.
Joel Bakan suggests that,
"the largest problematic myth today is the notion that
corporations can be good and socially responsible.
To me, that is like the
charm of the psychopath because they actually can't be those things just as
a psychopath can't. They can't be responsible to society when their required
imperative and structure is to be responsible only to their shareholders."
For this reason, he concludes, their ability to create a sense of themselves
that is very charming is one reason why people buy into the "sheer lunacy"
of the entire system.
In our conversation, Christopher Bayer noted that average Americans are
vulnerable to being seduced.
They want to believe what they hear and be
charmed.
"We all have the capacity to surrender and turn over our thinking
and our will to people who we find charismatic and charming," says Bayer.
Such likeability,
"is an insanely powerful force in human
interaction. We are all vulnerable to selling our souls to the devil. I
see this every day in my practice."
"There is an attitude
structure among plutocrats. They don't look at the rest of us as valid,
equal, worthy human beings. They take financial inventory constantly.
They measure worth in terms of their portfolio size. I hear this
constantly in my practice.
This is at the root of how they see the
world. They don't have empathy. They can't relate to it. The attitude
structure is if you're not a multimillionaire, then you're a failure,
there's something wrong with you and you're not a worthy human being.
This is the guts of the psychology of it and
they just can't relate to it."
This is the dividing line that separates the psychopaths running Wall
Street, the multinational corporations, private military contractors and
Washington from everyone else who desires a more just, equitable and
sustainable nation and world.
The psychopath lacks the ability to care for
the stranger.
This is why Jordan Belfort warns that their coldhearted
behavior, void of any redeeming morals and ethics, destroys everything.
As
long as such people are placed in charge of banks and firms that control so
much of our economic lives, and we continue to elect legislators and
presidents based upon charm rather than true integrity and moral substance,
the U.S. as a nation is destined to continue on its long descent into
psychopathology and towards a future of narcissistic bliss for an oligarchic
elite and immense suffering for everyone else.
