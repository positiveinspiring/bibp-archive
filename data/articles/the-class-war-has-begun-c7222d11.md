The Bonus Army veterans stage
a mass vigil
on the lawn of the U.S.
Capitol in 1932.
During the death throes of Herbert Hoovers
presidency in June 1932, desperate bands of men traveled to Washington and
set up camp within view of the Capitol.
The first contingent journeyed all the way from
Portland, Oregon, but others soon converged from all over - alone, in
groups, with families - until their main Hooverville on the Anacostia
Rivers fetid mudflats swelled to a population as high as 20,000.
The men,
World War I veterans who could not find jobs, became known as the Bonus Army
- for the modest government bonus they were owed for their service. Under a
law passed in 1924, they had been awarded roughly $1,000 each, to be
collected in 1945 or at death, whichever came first. But they didnt want to
wait any longer for their pre-New Deal entitlement - especially given that
Congress had bailed out big business with the creation of a Reconstruction
Finance Corporation earlier in its session.
Father Charles Coughlin, the
populist Radio Priest who became a phenomenon for railing against greedy
bankers and financiers, framed Washingtons double standard this way:
If the government can pay $2 billion to the
bankers and the railroads, why cannot it pay the $2 billion to the
soldiers?"
The echoes of our own Great Recession do not end there.
Both parties were
alarmed by this motley assemblage and its political rallies; the Secret
Service infiltrated its ranks to root out radicals. But a good Communist was
hard to find. The men were mostly middle-class, patriotic Americans. They
kept their improvised hovels clean and maintained small gardens.
Even so,
good behavior by the Bonus Army did not prevent the U.S. Armys hotheaded
chief of staff, General Douglas MacArthur, from summoning an overwhelming
force to evict it from Pennsylvania Avenue late that July.
After assaulting
the veterans and thousands of onlookers with tear gas, MacArthurs troops
crossed the bridge and burned down the encampment.
The general had acted
against Hoovers wishes, but the president expressed satisfaction afterward
that the government had dispatched a mob - albeit at the cost of killing
two of the demonstrators.
The public had another take.
When graphic
newsreels of the riotous mêlée fanned out to the nations movie theaters,
audiences booed MacArthur and his troops, not the men down on their luck.
Even the mining heiress
Evelyn Walsh McLean, the owner of the Hope diamond
and wife of the proprietor of the Washington Post, professed solidarity with
the mob that had occupied the nations capital.
The Great Depression was then nearly three years old, with FDR still in the
wings and some of the worst deprivation and unrest yet to come.
Three years
after our own crash, we do not have the benefit of historical omniscience to
know where 2011 is on the time line of Americas deepest bout of economic
distress since that era. (The White House, you may recall,
rolled out
recovery summer sixteen months ago.)
We dont know if our current
president will end up being viewed more like Hoover or FDR. We dont know
whether Occupy Wall Street and its proliferating satellites will spiral into
larger and more violent confrontations, disperse in cold weather, prove a
footnote to our narrative, or be the seeds of something big.
Whats as intriguing as Occupy Wall Street itself is that once again our
Establishment, left, right, and center, did not see the wave coming or
understand what it meant as it broke. Maybe its just human nature and the
power of denial, or maybe its a stubborn strain of all-American optimism,
but at each aftershock since the fall of Lehman Brothers, those at the top
have preferred not to see what they didnt want to see.
And so for the first
three weeks, the protests were alternately ignored, patronized, dismissed,
and insulted by politicians and the mainstream news media as a neo-Woodstock
for wannabe collegiate rebels without a cause - and not just in Fox-land.
CNNs new prime-time hopeful, Erin Burnett,
ridiculed the protesters as
bongo-playing know-nothings; a dispatch in The New Republic
called them,
an
unfocused rabble of ragtag discontents.
Those who did express sympathy for
Occupy Wall Street tended to pat it on the head before going on to fault it
for being leaderless, disorganized, and inchoate in its agenda.
Despite such dismissals, the movement, abetted by made-for-YouTube
confrontations with police, started to connect with the mass public much as
the Bonus Army did with a newsreel audience.
The week after a Wall Street
Journal editorial
claimed that no one seems to care very much about the
collection of neer-do-wells congregating in Zuccotti Park,
the paper
released its own poll, in collaboration with NBC News, finding that 37
percent of Americans supported the protesters, 25 percent had no opinion,
and just 18 percent opposed them.
The approval numbers for Occupy Wall
Street published in
Time and
Reuters were even higher - hitting 54 percent
in Time.
Apparently some of those dopey kids, staggering under student loans
and bereft of job prospects, have lots of parents and friends of all ages
who understand exactly what theyre talking about.
Occupy Wall Street
demonstrators asleep in Zuccotti Park.
Coverage increased and politicians ran for cover.
Mayor Bloomberg, who had
initially (and preposterously) portrayed the occupiers as
a threat to the
financial industrys lower-income service workers, gingerly observed that
some unspecified people
are very frustrated.
Though the Treasury
secretary, Timothy Geithner,
waffled when asked if he had any sympathy for
Occupy Wall Street, Barack Obama
publicly acknowledged the demonstrators,
broad-based frustration about how our financial system works.* (If
Bloomberg and Obama are both using frustration, you can be certain it is a
focus-group-tested trope chosen not to frighten the presumed sensibilities
of independents.)
Mitt Romney, who had first called the protests
dangerous, executed another of his patented flip-flops to assert that he,
too, identifies with Americas 99 percent, not the top one percent where
hes always dwelled.
Boy, I understand how these people feel,
he said.
(Boy, do these people not believe him.)
Even Eric Cantor, whod described
the protesters as mobs, started talking about - what else? -
frustration.
These efforts to domesticate and contain the protests are unlikely to
succeed. It is not frustration thats roiling America but anger, the anger
of a full-fledged class war. Try as polite company keeps trying to ignore
it, that war has been building in this country and abroad for much of this
decade and has been waged in earnest in America since the fall of 2008.
But
the crisp agenda demanded of Occupy Wall Street will not be forthcoming.
The
inchoateness of our particular class war is central to its meaning. America
is not Tahrir Square or the riot-scarred precincts of North London, where
everyone knows at birth who is in which class and why. We pride ourselves on
being a classless democracy. We abhor ideology. When Americans left and
right, young and old, express anger at an overclass, they dont necessarily
agree about whos on which side of that class divide.
The often confusing
fluidity of class definitions, especially in an America as polarized as ours
is now, may make our homegrown class war more volatile, not less.
The tea-party right finds the hippie-scented movement in lower Manhattan
repellent, but it and Occupy Wall Street are two sides of the same coin.
Take Back America, the initial tea-party battle cry, would work for those
in Zuccotti Park as well. The disagreement is about which America needs to
be taken back, and from whom.
Provoked by Obamas ascent, the right was ahead of the class-war curve, with
Sarah Palin sounding the charge when she
stuck up for the real America
against the elites during the 2008 campaign.
The real America, as she
defined it, was in small towns.
Those who are running our factories and
teaching our kids and growing our food.
In other words: It is the middle
class (or at least its white precincts) that fell behind while the rich got
richer.
The Über-class she and her angry followers would take to the
guillotine, however, is not defined by its super-wealth. It is first and
foremost exemplified by potentates in the federal government, especially the
Ivy League cohort of Obama - closely followed by the usual right-wing
populist bogeymen, the pointy-headed experts in fancy universities and the
mainstreammedia royalty with their gotcha questions.
Palin may now have abdicated her position on the barricades, not least
because she succumbed to
the financial blandishments of the unreal America,
but the zeal of her constituency has not faded a bit. The rights angry
class warriors constitute the vast majority of the GOP - that roughly
three-quarters of the party that seems determined to resist Romney no
matter what.
A Harvard-educated former Massachusetts governor, especially
one who embraced the social engineering of health-care reform, inspires
class anger from his own party to the same degree that his private-sector
record as a leveraged-buyout tycoon provokes class anger from Democrats.
But while Romney is a class enemy liberals and conservatives can unite
against, perhaps nothing has revealed how much the class warriors of the
right and left of our time have in common than the
national outpouring after
Steve Jobss death.
Indeed, the near-universal over-the-top emotional
response - more commensurate with a saintly religious or civic leader, not a
sometimes bullying captain of industry - brought Americans of all stripes
together as few events have in recent memory.
Some on the right were baffled that the ostensible Marxists demonstrating in
lower Manhattan would observe a moment of silence and assemble makeshift
shrines for a top one-percenter like Jobs, whose expensive products were
engineered for
near-instant obsolescence and produced by Chinese laborers
in factories with
substandard health-and-safety records.
For heavens sake,
the guy didnt even join Warren Buffett and
Bill Gates in their
Giving
Pledge.
There is perhaps no greater image of irony,
wrote the conservative
blogger Michelle Malkin, than that of anti-capitalist, anti-corporate,
anti-materialist extremists of the Occupy Wall Street movement paying
tribute to Steve Jobs."
Yet those demonstrators who celebrated Jobs were not necessarily hypocrites
at all - and no more anti-capitalist than the Bonus Army of 1932.
If you
love your Mac and iPod, you can still despise CDOs and credit-default swaps.
Jobss genius - in the words of Regis McKenna, a Silicon Valley marketing
executive who worked with him early on - was his ability,
to strip away the
excess layers of business, design, and innovation until only the simple,
elegant reality remained.
The supposed genius of modern Wall Street is the
exact reverse, piling on excess layers of business and innovation on ever
thinner and more exotic creations until simple reality is distorted and
obscured.
Those in Palins real America may not be agitated about the
economic 99-vs.-one percent inequality brought about by the rise of the
financial sector in the past three decades, but, like class warriors of the
left, they know that financial instruments wreaked havoc on their 401(k)s,
homes, and jobs.
The bottom line remains that Wall Streets opaque
inventions led directly to TARP, the taxpayers bank bailout that achieved
the seemingly impossible feat of unifying the left and right in rage against
government - much as Jobss death achieved the equally surprising coup of
unifying left and right in mourning a corporate god.
That bipartisan grief was arguably as much for the passing of a capitalist
culture as for the man himself.
Finance long ago supplanted visionary
entrepreneurial careers like Jobss as the most desired calling among
Americas top-tier university students, just as hedge-fund tycoons like
John
Paulson and
Steve Cohen passed Jobs on the Forbes 400 list. Americans sense
that something incalculable has been lost in this transformation that cannot
be measured in dollars and cents.
Theres no handier way to track just how much American capitalism has
changed since Apples divine, midseventies birth in a garage than by
following the corporate afterlife of the American icon most frequently
invoked as Jobss antecedent in his obituaries, Thomas Alva Edison.
Like
Jobs, Edison wasnt just a brilliant fount of technological breakthroughs
but a businessman as well (albeit a less savvy one). He was the official
founder of General Electric - known as Edison General Electric at its
inception in 1890, before Edison was strong-armed into an early merger.
G.E.
was created to maximize the profits of his many inventions and businesses,
Apple style. And like Apple, the company flourished as an exemplar of
American capitalism at its most creative and productive, even in a downtime.
During the Great Depression, it produced an
astonishing array of Jobs-worthy
innovations,
-
the first commercial fluorescent lamp
-
the first waste Disposall
-
the first night baseball game
-
the first television network
This was
the job-creating, profit-making, America-empowering corporate behemoth,
spewing out refrigerators and jet engines, that would ultimately
recruit
Ronald Reagan as its television pitchman in the fifties.
But the G.E. born out of Edisons genius and synergistic with Reagans brand
of postwar jingoism is far from the G.E. of our time. Its once minor
financial-services subsidiary, G.E. Capital, metastasized over the past 30
years in sync with the growth of the new Wall Street.
In 1990, G.E. Capital
accounted for just a quarter of G.E.s overall profits, but by 2007, on the
eve of the crash, it had gobbled up
55 percent of the bottom line. Its
sophisticated gambling strategies, like those of the big banks it emulated,
amounted to an ingenious get-rich-quick scheme for high-rollers until the
bottom fell out, taking shareholders and employees, not to mention the
country, down with it.
G.E. Capitals
dependence on short-term credit was so
grave that it forced G.E. to cut back its dividend for the first time since
the thirties and to turn to Buffett for a $3 billion emergency cash infusion
in the dark days of October 2008.
The cheerleader for ratcheting up that risk at G.E. was the CEO, Jeffrey Immelt.
These days he heads the presidents ineffectual
Council on Jobs and
Competitiveness, despite his own corporations record of job-shedding in
America and the revelation that G.E.
paid no American taxes in 2010 (on more
than $14 billion in profits, including $5.1 billion in the U.S.).
Immelt is
a Republican, but that didnt prevent Palin this fall from
calling G.E. the
poster child of corporate welfare and crony capitalism. (Bill OReilly and
Newt Gingrich joined this class-warfare chorus.)
On this point, once again,
there is no air between the right and Occupy Wall Street. And as both camps
condemn Immelt, so they are also united in the conviction that the godfather
of Obamas economic team, Robert Rubin, is likewise a poster child for
corporate welfare and crony capitalism. Rubin, whose useful cronies included
his former protégés Geithner and Lawrence Summers,
encouraged reckless greed
and risk at Citigroup during the bubble much as Immelt did at G.E. Capital,
ultimately requiring the taxpayers rescue of TARP.
Politicians in either party, of course, never use the term class warfare
to describe whats going on in America, unless its Republican leaders
accusing Obama of waging it every time he even mildly asserts timeless
liberal bromides about taxing the rich.
Nor do most politicians want to talk
about the depth of the crisis in present-day capitalism, since to
acknowledge its scale would only dramatize how little they intend to do
about it.
The whole system is screwed up, and its not all Wall Streets fault - or
remotely in the financial sectors power alone to solve. As middle-class
Americans have lost their jobs or watched their wages stagnate or decline
while corporations pile up record profits, theyve also seen CEOs far
removed from Wall Street (at Hewlett-Packard and Yahoo most recently) walk
away with rich settlements even after theyve laid off workers en masse,
mismanaged their companies, or wrecked them.
But at least politicians pay
lip service to the woes of the middle class. That Americas poverty rate has
risen to
its highest level since 1993 goes all but unmentioned by leaders in
both parties.
The poor, after all, dont make campaign contributions and are
unlikely to vote. And they have even less clout than usual now that
Republican legislators and governors, fanning bogus fears of voter fraud,
have mandated
new, Jim Crow-style restrictions to scare away poor, elderly,
and minority voters in fourteen states.
In the Beltway bubble, even the
local poor are out of sight and out of mind; with a 6.1 percent unemployment
rate and a median income of $84,523 (versus $50,046 nationally), Washington
is now the wealthiest metro area in the country and,
according to Gallup,
departs from all 50 states in believing by a majority that the economy is
getting better.
Back in 1931, even
Hoover worried that timid people, black with despair
had lost faith in the American system and might be susceptible to the kind
of revolutions that had become a spreading peril abroad.
When Roosevelt took
office, he had the confidence that his leadership could overcome that level
of despair and head off radicals on the left or right. In 2011, the despair
is again black, and faith in the system is shaky, but it would be hard to
describe the atmosphere at Zuccotti Park or a tea-party rally as
prerevolutionary.
The anger of the class war across the spectrum seems
fatalistic more than incendiary. No wonder. Everyone just assumes the fix is
in for the highest bidder, no matter what. Take - please! - the latest
bipartisan Beltway panacea: the congressional supercommittee charged by the
president and GOP leaders to hammer out the deficit-reduction compromise
they couldnt do on their own.
The Washington Post
recently discovered that
nearly 100 of the registered lobbyists no doubt charged with besieging the
committee to protect the interests of the financial, defense, and
health-care industries are former employees of its dozen members. Indeed,
six of those members (three from each party) currently have former lobbyists
on their staffs.
Elections are supposed to resolve conflicts in a great democracy,
but our
next one will not.
Just in time for election season, Obama has recovered his populist rhetoric
(if not populism itself) and will say the right things about Wall Street,
about that frustration out there, about the modest reforms of Dodd-Frank,
and about millionaires who dont pay their fair share of taxes.
Its not
clear if anyone believes it, including him. Having been a bystander to
history when the tea party harvested populist rage during the summer of
2009, he may have a tough time co-opting Occupy Wall Street now to plug the
so-called enthusiasm gap in his base. Theres a serious danger that the
anger could co-opt him instead.
To pander to the swing state of North
Carolina, the Democrats in their wisdom chose to hold their convention in a
city best known as the headquarters of Bank of America, whose recent
financial innovations include
illegal robo-foreclosures and the
$5 monthly
fee on debit cards.
Occupy Charlotte could be a far more telegenic show than
the one happening inside the hall.
Despite all the chatter to the contrary, Obama is so far
outdrawing all the
GOP candidates combined in Wall Street contributions.
His best hope is that
that fact is blurred by either Romney, the plutocrat from central casting
(below image),
or Rick Perry, a creature of lobbyists and pay-for-play government in Texas.
Herman Cains as yet little-known corporate history would also prove
problematic to Republicans:
Hes not only an unabashed Alan Greenspan fan
who was chairman of the Kansas City Fed but also served on the board of
Aquila, an energy company that ended up paying a $10.5 million settlement
for Enron-esque
shenanigans. (Cains campaign manager
hails from Americans
for Prosperity, the Koch brothers political front.)
Whatever else is to be
said about Michele Bachmann, Rick Santorum, Tim Pawlenty, and Ron Paul, they
actually spent most of their pre-political careers in the aggrieved middle
class. But they are all history in the presidential race, and perhaps were
destined to be, given how big money plays its hand.
You dont have to like
their views to find their earnest but misplaced faith in the free-market
efficiency of the political system a bit poignant.
Elections are supposed to resolve conflicts in a great democracy, but our
next one will not. The elites will face off against the elites to a
standoff, and the issues animating the class war in both parties wont even
be on the table.
The structural crises in our economy, our government, and
our culture defy any of the glib solutions proposed by current Democrats or
Republicans; the quixotic third-party movements being hatched by well-heeled
do-gooders are vanity productions. The two powerful forces that extricated
America from the Great Depression - the courageous leadership and reformist
zeal of Roosevelt, the mobilization for World War II - are not on offer this
time.
Our class war will rage on without winners indefinitely, with all
sides stewing in their own juices, until - when? No one knows.
The reckoning
with capitalisms failures over the past three decades, both in America and
the globe beyond, may well be on hold until the top one percent becomes
persuaded that its own economic fate is tied to the other 99 percents.
Which is to say things may have to get worse before they get better.
Over the short term, meanwhile, the Democratic Establishment is no doubt
wishing that Occupy Wall Street will melt away with the winter snows, much
as its Republican counterpart hopes that the leaderless tea party will
wither if Romney nails down the nomination. But even in the unlikely event
that these wishes come true, it is not likely to be the end of the story.
Though the Bonus Army was driven out of Washington in the similarly fraught
election year of 1932, the newsreels they left behind turned out to be
previews of coming attractions for the long decade still to come.
