Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia (shown)
made headlines nationwide this week after bluntly telling law students at
the University of Hawaii that internment camps to detain Americans would
eventually return.
Acknowledging that the infamous Supreme
Court-approved
internment of Japanese-Americans in wretched camps during World War II
was wrong, the conservative-leaning justice followed up by adding that,
"you are kidding yourself if you think the
same thing will not happen again." In "times of war," Scalia said,
citing a Latin expression attributed to Cicero, "the laws fall silent."
According to the Associated Press, which first
reported the explosive February 3 statements, Scalia was responding to a
question about one of the Supreme Court's most widely criticized decisions.
Amid national hysteria following the
Japanese regime's attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt issued an "executive order" in 1942 purporting to justify the
mass detention of people of Japanese ancestry - the vast majority of
whom were U.S. citizens. In 1944, the high court upheld the convictions of
two men for failing to report to an internment camp in Korematsu v.
United States.
"Well of course Korematsu was
wrong. And I think we have repudiated in a later case," Scalia was
quoted as telling students and faculty during a lunchtime question and
answer session.
"But you are kidding yourself if you think
the same thing will not happen again."
Pointing to the Latin expression about laws
falling silent during war-time, the longest-serving justice said,
"That's what was going on - the panic about
the war and the invasion of the Pacific and whatnot."
"That's what happens," Scalia continued. "It
was wrong, but I would not be surprised to see it happen again, in time
of war. It's no justification, but it is the reality."
In other words, one of the nation's top judicial
officials believes that during a "time of war," Americans run the risk of
being unconstitutionally rounded up by the federal government and detained
in camps like over 110,000 almost certainly innocent Japanese-descent
individuals during World War II.
Keep in mind that the U.S. government is
currently engaged in multiple unconstitutional wars, including many that
could potentially go on indefinitely - especially the "terror" war, which
now spans across the "Homeland" and the entire planet.
Incredibly, buried inside the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA), Congress and the president have even approved a
statute pretending to legalize
the indefinite detention of
Americans without charges, trial, due process, or any other
constitutionally guaranteed rights.
The Obama administration even
claims to have the power to secretly murder Americans with no trial -
and, in fact, it
has done so in at least several cases that are now known publicly.
A Justice Department memo leaked in 2013
outlined the outlandish legal rationale purporting to authorize
Obama
serving as
judge, jury, and executioner.
When asked by the Huffington Post whether the
administration should tell the public when it secretly murders an American,
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi
said "it depends."
The dean of the law school, Avi Soifer, tried to
downplay Scalia's explosive remarks, telling the AP he thought the Supreme
Court justice was merely suggesting that people should always be vigilant
and that the law alone cannot be relied on to provide protection.
"We do need a court that sometimes will say
there are individual or group rights that are not being adequately
protected by the democratic process," Soifer was quoted as saying,
though it was not clear what "group rights" was supposed to refer to.
The dean also noted that Scalia was among those
who reined in the power of "military commissions."
However, despite efforts to downplay the clear
statements made by Scalia, countless Americans believe there is good cause
to be concerned - and not just because history conclusively proves that the
U.S. government is capable of lawlessly interning citizens.
In 2012, for example, a leaked military document
dubbed "Army
Field Manual 3-39.40: Internment and Resettlement Operations" provides
guidance on interning Americans on U.S. soil.
It even teaches how to identify,
"malcontents, trained agitators, and
political leaders" and how "to reduce or remove antagonistic attitudes."
Of course, there have been countless reports
about internment facilities all across the United States set up under the
aegis of the Federal Emergency Management Agency -
so-called "FEMA camps."
In 2006, a Halliburton subsidiary was even
handed a $385-million contract to
build a vast network of "detention centers" for the Department of
Homeland Security. Officials downplayed the news, saying the camps were
simply meant to prepare for a potential massive influx of immigrants.
Stories and fears about "FEMA camps" are often
dismissed by the establishment and even some credible researchers who have
investigated.
The centers, however, along with countless
videos claiming to show camps across the United States, have fueled strong
suspicion all across the political spectrum. Meanwhile, even a cursory
review of the so-called "executive orders" issued over the last century
shows that the executive branch believes it can seize virtually total
control of the nation in the event of an "emergency" declared by the
president.
Even in recent years, Americans have been herded
by federal officials into camps against their will.
After hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, for
example, authorities declared martial law, forcibly disarmed residents, and
forced massive numbers of people into FEMA-run camps.
During the recent swine flu hysteria, officials
were also
openly discussing and preparing for the forcible quarantine of Americans.
More recently still, homeless people in some areas have also been coerced
into camps under penalty of arrest.
Obviously it makes sense for government to
prepare for contingencies. As with all official programs, however,
innocent-seeming schemes can be abused, and often are. With the U.S.
government becoming infamous for brazenly lying to the public - WMDs in
Iraq, for example, or you can keep your health insurance - it is hardly
surprising that public suspicion of Washington, D.C., and its intentions
continues to grow.
More than a few recent training exercises have
added fuel to the fire.
Among the most alarming:
...and more.
The Obama administration's
wild stockpiling and distribution to local
law enforcement of "weapons of war" for domestic use has also raised serious concerns.
Analyst Justin King, writing in the
Digital Journal,
said Scalia's remarks should "terrify" Americans.
"First, the longest-serving Justice on the
Supreme Court has openly stated that the court does not adhere to the
Constitution of the United States, but rather allows laws to wither in
times of war," he wrote.
"The highest court in the land will gladly
send you to a prison camp out of fear, knowing that it is wrong."
He also pointed out that with
the vague
"terror"
war still raging, virtually anybody could be caught in a government dragnet
merely by virtue of their beliefs.
In fact, the U.S. government has already made
clear in numerous official documents that its terror war is
increasingly focused on its own
domestic political foes.
From the
Department of Homeland Security and the
Justice Department to the
Pentagon, numerous tentacles of the lawless executive branch have openly
identified everyday Americans as potential terrorists and extremists.
Among others:
-
pro-life activists
-
Christians
-
gun-rights supporters
-
states' rights advocates
-
veterans
-
conservatives
-
libertarians
-
Ron Paul supporters
-
liberty lovers,
...and more.
Recent surveys show that
more than two thirds of Americans believe the federal government is "out
of control" and a "threat" to their basic liberties. It is not hard to see
why.
Is it time to panic? Probably not.
Still, with Washington, D.C., becoming
increasingly lawless with each passing year, Americans would be wise to
pay very close attention to Scalia's remarks.
