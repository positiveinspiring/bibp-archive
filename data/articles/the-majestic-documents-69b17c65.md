The original and only documented reference to this project came in 1983 when the “Project Aquarius Briefing Document” was shown to William L. Moore (the co-author of the book, The Roswell Incident) by an insider source in the U.S. Intelligence community.
According to the documentation briefly revealed to Moore, Project Snowbird was established in 1972 to research and test-fly a recovered alien spacecraft. To date, attempts to resolve this claim via the Freedom of Information Act have been unsuccessful. The existence of another Project Snowbird, however, has been verified. This was a joint U.S. Army-U.S. Air Force military exercise established in 1955 to train troops to fight in the sub-Arctic region. (watch Video HERE)
