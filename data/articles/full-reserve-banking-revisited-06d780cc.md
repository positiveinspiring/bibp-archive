Recently
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published a report called The
Chicago Plan Revisited.
The
report claims that
Fractional Reserve Banking is problematic and discusses
the perceived benefits of
Full Reserve Banking.
However: the problem
is not money creation and not even Fractional Reserve Banking. The problem
is interest. It matters not whether we pay interest for fully
or partly backed loans.
The report did make the rounds in the
Alternative Media. Several people sent it to me and a number of sites
commented on it.
Most people of course understand that when the IMF moves its lips it is
probably in the process of committing genocide, but since full reserve
banking has been almost universally promoted by monetary reformers in the US
(but not Europe), it has raised many eyebrows. People feel vindicated.
But unfortunately the Money Power is again ahead
of the field and has slyly sold this reform to both the libertarians and
the populists.
Fractional Reserve
Banking
First, lets recap. Under a fractional
reserve banking system, banks do not lend out deposits, but create new
credit, new dollars based on the deposit.
Classically a bank can create 90 cents for every
dollar that is deposited. This is not a constant. The last 20 years the
banks were allowed to create up to 98 cents on every dollar deposited.
It is not true that the bank can lend out ten
times the deposit as is often claimed. In the old days the goldsmiths did
lend out ten times the deposit, but in the modern age the banks have managed
to obscure the process.
The banking system as a whole does
create 10 times as much and up to 50 times as much when they are allowed to
lend out 98 cents on the dollar.
Heres how it works:
when a dollar is deposited,
the bank creates 90 cents and lends it out. Now there is $1,90 (the deposit,
plus the new 90 cents). The new 90 cents are then deposited in another
account, perhaps at another bank. This 90 cent deposit is used to create 81
cents. Now there is $2,71 in circulation.
Next the 81 new cents are deposited at the next
bank, who the proceeds to lend out 72 new cents, after which there is $3,43
in total. Etcetera...
After the whole process is done there are 10 new dollars
in circulation.
So this is the sleight of hand of fractional
reserve banking: the bank requires a deposit to lend, but it does not lend
the deposit.
It creates the credit the minute it is lent out. Individual
banks almost double the deposit, but the banking system as whole in this way
ultimately creates 10 new dollars on every dollar that is deposited.
To fully appreciate the extent of this fraud, it
is crucial to understand that
the banking system is one, as we previously discussed.
All the banks own each other so basically there is one banker at the top
that does indeed create all the money out there.
Full Reserve Banking
Full reserve banking pretends to solve the problem because it would require
the banks not to create new money based on the deposit, but to actually lend
out the deposit itself.
Full reserve banking is propagated by many
monetary reformers, both proven frauds like Murray Rothbard and his
Austrian
Economics and classical populists.
The Kucinich HR2990 N.E.E.D act, which was
penned by the American Monetary Institutes Zarlenga and which calls for a
debt free government unit, also wants to provide credit via full reserve
banking.
However,
the problem is not debt, its interest.
This is just one of the reasons why it is so
essential to have a clear grasp of the issue, to understand that debt does
not automatically mean interest.
The point is:
we are made to believe that
we would feel better if we would pay interest over fully backed loans than
over freshly printed cash.
For instance,
Gary North made a career of denouncing Greenbackers' (an antiquated
term in this day and age of Social and Mutual Credit) by writing:
Counterfeiting (he is calling fractional reserve banking
counterfeiting, AM) is theft for one reason, and only one reason. Paper
bills are issued that look exactly like bills that are backed by 100% of
their face value in money metals, but these bills do not have such a
backing. In other words, if all the individuals went to claim their
money metals at the same time, some people could not collect.
Pay attention here, because these are the
little details that make or break real reform. It is somewhat subtle lies
like this that allow the Money Power to maintain its domination.
In a full reserve gold based banking system
there would be no theft, according to Gary North. However: we would still
pay $300k interest over a $200k mortgage. We would be paying them in gold
coins or in paper fully backed by gold, but we would be paying.
We all know that gold is completely controlled
by
the Rothschilds and their ilk. Gold based loans is what brought them to
power.
Are we really going to believe they care whether they get paid for a gold or
paper based, full or fractional reserve banking based monopoly? I dont think so.
The truth is, that Fractional Reserve Banking
actually proves for all with eyes to see that we can create all the money we
will ever need at basically zero cost.
And if credit can be so cheaply created, it is
insane that society should pay such incredible sums for it.
Lets recall that interest is always a wealth
transfer from poor to rich. The rich have money, the poor need to borrow.
All in all the poorest 80% pay anywhere between 5 to 10 trillion dollars per
year in interest to the richest 10% worldwide.
And yes, fractional reserve banking is unstable:
banks go bust all the time.
But really, even that would not happen if the
system was not controlled by total maniacs who create the boom/bust cycle by
letting their own banks go bust after each credit induced boom. In this way
they create depressions, because their banks cannot lend when busted,
meaning a deflation with associated economic collapse.
Normal people managing the system would allow a
stable situation, even with fractional reserve banking.
It also is a convoluted and expensive way of
creating credit.
Mutual Credit is completely simple and requires zero reserves or savings
and the credit facility cannot go bust because of bank runs.
But antiquated as it may be, fractional reserve
banking is not the heart of the matter.
Compound Interest
The
Chicago Plan
encompasses more than full reserve banking.
It is based on
debt free Government money. This is obviously much better than a usurious
monopoly in private hands. This matter is also (favorably) discussed in the
IMF report.
However, debt free money combined with full
reserve banking allows the Money Power to regain
full control of all the money in circulation in a relatively short
period of time through compound interest.
Heres some relevant text from the linked
article on compound interest with debt free units:
Lets say,
for arguments sake, they obtain 10% of its supply.
They
start lending at say 5%. Of this 5% they use 2% for cost. The remaining
3% is profit, new capital, new deposits for their banks.
After 1 year of lending they control 13%
of the money supply. After two years 16.09%. After three years 19.28.
After 10 years of
lending they would control 34% and after 20 years 81% of the
money supply.
Compound
interest in operation.
Of course,
the exact numbers are not important here, its the process that
matters.
Conclusion
Full Reserve Banking
is still... well, banking.
The wise know that banking is one and banking is
the problem. Dont try to control the banks, because they will always
control you. They control the money supply and rape us with interest on a
money supply they completely own, be it through paper or through gold,
through fractional or full reserve banking.
To the Money Power its all the same. The System was
built to enslave, it cannot be
really reformed. Banks should be closed and replaced with Mutual (interest
free) Credit facilities.
But why would the IMF promote a debt free
Government unit? That indeed is a good question.
Its not the first time
that a blatant Money Power outfit like the IMF does so. Some time back the
Financial Timess Lex suggested the Government might consider printing some
debt free cash. (Unfortunately I read about it in their paper edition and
their Internet content is behind a pay per view wall.)
Why?
It seems the System is so insolvent the Money
Power is actually fearing losing control over the bond market, which is the
basis of its supremacy. The level of indebtedness is such that its banks and
the taxpayer underwriting their operations might get overwhelmed.
Printing some debt free cash to plug a few
gaping holes might actually just be what the doctor ordered at this stage.
