OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES
There are many other locations not listed above that are worthy of
consideration as a possible detention camp site, but due to space
limitations and the time needed to verify, could not be included here.
Virtually all military reservations, posts, bases, stations, & depots can be
considered highly suspect (because it is "federal" land).
Also fitting this
category are "Regional Airports" and "International Airports" which also
fall under federal jurisdiction and have limited-access areas. Mental
hospitals, closed hospitals & nursing homes, closed military bases, wildlife
refuges, state prisons, toxic waste dumps, hotels and other areas all have
varying degrees of potential for being a detention camp area.
The likelihood
of a site being suspect increases with transportation access to the site,
including airports/airstrips, railheads, navigable waterways & ports,
interstate and US highways. Some facilities are "disguised" as industrial or
commercial properties, camouflaged or even wholly contained inside large
buildings (Indianapolis) or factories.
Many inner-city buildings left vacant
during the de-industrialization of America have been quietly acquired and
held, sometimes retrofitted for their new uses.
CANADA
Our Canadian friends tell us that virtually all Canadian military bases,
especially those north of the 50th Parallel, are all set up with
concentration camps.
Not even half of these can be listed, but here are a
few sites with the massive land space to handle any population:
-
Suffield CFB - just north of Medicine
Hat, less than 60 miles from the USA

northeast of Edmonton

Wainwright CFB - halfway between
