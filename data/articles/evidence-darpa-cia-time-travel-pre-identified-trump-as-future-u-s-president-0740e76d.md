As previously reported, former U.S. chrononaut Andrew D. Basiago, a whistleblower from the secret U.S. time travel program, has described how as a child serving in Project Pegasus in the early 1970's.
He was present at lunches held at La Hacienda restaurant in Old Town Albuquerque, NM, that were attended by project principals and future American presidents, including,
George HW Bush Bill Clinton George W. Bush,
George HW Bush
Bill Clinton
George W. Bush,
...shortly after they were informed that Project Pegasus had found via quantum access that they would one day serve as President.
Specifically, Mr. Basiago attended a luncheon held for the Bushes and one held for Clinton after they were briefed about their future Presidencies and still processing the information. Mr. Basiago, a childhood participant from 1968-72 in DARPA's secret quantum access Tesla-technology time travel Project Pegasus, has also publicly stated that his father Raymond F. Basiago, had stated that both U.S. President Barack H. Obama and himself - Andrew D. Basiago, had been pre-identified by the Presidential time travel program as future U.S. presidents. [1] Mr. Basiago's father, Raymond F. Basiago, was an official in the CIA Project Pegasus time travel project, including the unit responsible for pre-identifying and briefing future U.S. President via time travel.
Raymond F. Basiago, along with other CIA time travel officials, notified Andy Basiago of his own future destiny as U.S. President (although not of the exact year of a future Basiago presidency).
Mr. Basiago was first told of his future presidency in 1980 during Mars jump room training, not in 1971. In the early 1970s Andy was permitted to sit in on a number of Project Pegasus secret time travel briefings of future Presidents.
Evidence of Donald J. Trump as elected 2016 U.S. President This reporter asked Andrew D. Basiago,
"Logically, it would seem reasonable that if your father informed you of Bill Clinton's pre-identification as a future U.S. President, he would also have informed you of whether Hillary Clinton had been pre-identified as a future U.S. President by secret time travel."
Andrew D. Basiago responded,
"Alfred, as for Hillary Clinton, I have no data. I think it is reasonable to infer that were she a future President there would have been pre-ID of her tied up in pre-ID of WJC [William J. Clinton] as POTUS. "As for [Donald J.] Trump, I have a vague memory that my father took special note of Trump during an appearance by him on The Phil Donahue Show and might have even commented that he was a future U.S. President," Mr. Basiago concluded.
Andrew D. Basiago also added,
"My reliable memory that my father identified Newt Gingrich as a future national leader, President or Vice President."
No witness to any briefing of Donald J. Trump by representatives of the DARPA-CIA secret time travel program has come forward has come forward publicly as Mr. Basiago has in the case of other pre-identified U.S. Presidents, including,
George HW Bush Bill Clinton George W. Bush Barack Obama
George W. Bush
Barack Obama
Asked whether his statements are hearsay, Andrew D. Basiago responded,
"My statement is not hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted that Trump will win the election. Rather, it is direct evidence showing that my father made the verbal act placing Trump among the individuals identified as future Presidents via the CIA's quantum access capability."

Donald Trump in quantum access cultural references That Donald J. Trump may have been pre-identified by secret Time Travel is strengthened by the fact that Donald Trump does appear pre-identified in a number of cultural references that could plausibly have employed time travel data leaked from the secret DARPA-CIA time travel pre-identification program for purposes of social manipulation.
