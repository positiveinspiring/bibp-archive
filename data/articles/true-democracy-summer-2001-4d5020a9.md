Northrop Corporation
Makes U.S. anti-gravity craft, back-engineered from alien technology,
near Lancaster, California
[Editor's note: Lancaster, California is in the city of Los Angeles.]
Why can't engineering be used for something other than weapons? Northrop
is designated under the Weapons classification on the Shadow Government Web
site. These people can advance science immeasurably if only they were given
the chance.
Here is what the company statement states:
Company Profile
Headquartered in Los Angeles,
California, Northrop Grumman provides an array of world-class technologies
and core competencies to military and commercial markets, principally as a
leading defense electronics, systems integration, and information technology
company that retains strong capabilities in military aircraft systems and
modifications, commercial aircraft assemblies, and marine systems.
In demand as a prime contractor, principal subcontractor, partner, and preferred
supplier, Northrop Grumman participates on many high-priority defense, commercial
aerospace, and information technology programs in the United States and abroad.
The Company's growth strategy is bolstered by a strong financial base, led
by an experienced leadership team, and executed by a dedicated workforce.
Northrop Grumman is a broad-based enterprise that can meet the demands of
both the defense and commercial aerospace environment and plays a major role
in some of the world's most advanced weapons systems and technologies. The
company is aligned in three business sectors to sharpen its collective focus
in principal business areas, achieve operational efficiencies on a significant
scale, and enhance its competitive position and opportunities for growth
in the aerospace marketplace. The three business sectors are: the Integrated
Systems Sector, based in Dallas, Texas; the Electronic Sensors and Systems
Sector, headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland; and Logicon Inc., based in
Herndon, Virginia.
The Electronic Sensors and Systems Sector (ES3)
This sector makes a wide variety of defense electronics and systems, airspace
management systems, precision weapons, marine systems, space systems, and
automation and information systems. These include fire control radars for
the F-16 fighter aircraft, the F-22 air dominance fighter, and the Longbow
Apache helicopter. Other key products include the AWACS airborne early warning
radar and the Joint STARS air-to-ground surveillance radar sensor, as well
as the Longbow Hellfire missile and BAT "brilliant" antiarmor submunition.
ES3 also provides tactical military radars and countrywide
air defense systems, plus airborne electronic countermeasures systems intended
to jam enemy aircraft and weapons systems.
ES3 is a world leader in airspace management, having
produced more than 460 civilian air traffic control systems in 12 countries.
It also makes sophisticated undersea warfare systems, and naval propulsion
and power generation systems. Additionally, it provides postal automation,
image processing, material management, asset track and trace, and data communication
capabilities for package delivery firms and government agencies.
Logicon Inc., a Northrop Grumman Company
This Northrop Grumman subsidiary is a leader in advanced information technologies,
systems and services. Logicon plays a leading role in providing information
technology services to the Federal government through its ANSWER and Millennia
programs with the General Services Administration. Logicon is also part of
a team working with the Internal Revenue Service to modernize the nation's
tax system.
Logicon has extensive expertise in command, control, communications, computers,
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. It is the principal management
support element for major weapons systems, such as the U.S. Navy's AEGIS,
while also providing mission planning for the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Special
Operations Command. Logicon provides base operations support for NASA's Kennedy
Space Center, the Cape Canaveral Air Station and Patrick Air Force Base,
among others. In addition, Logicon provides information technology services
to commercial customers and to the other Northrop Grumman sectors.
The Integrated Systems Sector (ISS)
ISS is the prime contractor for the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar
System (Joint STARS), the most advanced airborne targeting and battle management
system in the world, and the U.S. Air Force's B-2 Spirit stealth bomber.
It has a principal role in producing tactical aircraft such as the U.S. Navy's
F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter and the Joint Strike Fighter. It also produces
the EA-6B Prowler electronic countermeasures aircraft, and is upgrading the
E-2C Hawkeye early-warning aircraft. Northrop Grumman also is the world's
largest independent supplier of commercial aerostructures, including fuselage
and tail sections, doors, control surfaces, nacelles and thrust reversers
for a variety of commercial and military aircraft.
