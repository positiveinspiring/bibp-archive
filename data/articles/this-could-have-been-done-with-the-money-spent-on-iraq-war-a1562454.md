This is one of the best and moving videos I have seen on youtube recently,
and I am reposting it because it should get a much bigger audience. Hundreds
of Billions of Dollars have been wasted and spent on destruction, pain and
suffering. This clearly is the best way to spend money, ISN'T IT???
Yes, it's a great way to spend money!
Like President
George W. Bush said rightly in 2002:
"I just want you to know that, when we talk
about war, we're really talking about peace."
So all this money have been spent on PEACE, not
war. I hope the everyone of those cowardish/liberal/godless people out there
got the message! So shut up and give the war more funding, because it's all
about peace!
Which country can we bomb next?
We really need to spread more Peace.
