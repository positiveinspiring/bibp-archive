Facebook cookie collection 'could be dangerous'!
A cyberlaw expert says third parties and advertisers
could abuse Facebook's
practice - as claimed by a blogger -
of tracking online activity
even after users log out of the social network
An Australian technologist has caused a global
stir after discovering
Facebook tracks the websites its users visit even
when they are logged out of the social networking site.
Separately, Facebook's new
Timeline feature, launched last week, has been
inadvertently accessed by users early, revealing a feature that allows
people to see who removed them from their friends' lists.
Facebook's changes - which turn profiles into a chronological scrapbook of
the user's life - are designed to let its 800 million members share what
they are reading, listening to or watching in real time.
But they have been
met with alarm by some who fear over-sharing.

Of course, Facebook's bottom line improves the more users decide to share.
Reports suggest that Facebook staff refer internally to "Zuck's law", which
describes Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's belief that every year people
share twice as much online - a trend that has caused Facebook's valuation to
skyrocket towards $US100 billion.
"Facebook is a lot more than a social network and ultimately wants to be the
premier platform on which people experience, organize and share digital
entertainment," said Ovum analyst Eden Zoller.
But in alarming new revelations, Wollongong-based
Nik Cubrilovic
conducted
tests, which revealed that when you log out of Facebook, rather than
deleting its tracking cookies, the site merely modifies them, maintaining
account information and other unique tokens that can be used to identify
you.

Whenever you visit a web page that contains a Facebook button or widget,
your browser is still sending details of your movements back to Facebook,
Cubrilovic says.
"Even if you are logged out, Facebook still knows and can track every page
you visit," Cubrilovic wrote in a blog post. "The only solution is to delete every Facebook cookie in your browser, or to
use a separate browser for Facebook interactions."

Cubrilovic is working on a new unnamed start-up but has previously been
involved with large technology blog
TechCrunch and online storage company
Omnidrive.
He backed up his claims with detailed technical information. His post was
picked up by technology news sites around the world but Facebook has yet to
provide a response to Fairfax Media and others.
David Vaile, executive director of UNSW's Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre,
said Facebook's changes were a ''breathtaking and audacious grab for whole
life data''.
In an email interview he accused the social networking site of
attempting to ''normalize gross and unsafe overexposure''.
''While initially opt-in, the default then seems to be expose everything,
and Facebook have form in the past for lowering protection after people get
used to a certain level of initial protection - bait and switch,'' he said.
Stephen Collins, spokesman for the online users' lobby group Electronic
Frontiers Australia, said he did not believe Cubrilovic's revelations would
see people turn away from the site in droves but he hoped users became more
engaged with the issue.
''Facebook, once again, are doing things that are beyond most users'
capacity to understand while reducing their privacy. That's just not cool.
I'd go so far as to say it's specifically unethical,'' he said.
Collins said the only reason he still uses Facebook is to help his
14-year-old daughter on the site. He said it took him an hour to lock down
his profile to his satisfaction following the recent changes.
''It's just not good enough. The default setting for any site should be
'reveal nothing about me unless I make a specific choice otherwise','' he
said.
Others have
compared Facebook's changes to Bentham's panopticon - a design
for a prison where the guards can see all inmates but where the inmates
never know whether they're being watched.
The result, applied to Facebook,
is that real-time sharing means we always feel like we're being watched and
this then influences our behavior.
Cubrilovic said he tried to contact Facebook to inform it of his discovery
but did not get a reply.
He said there were significant risks to the privacy
of users, particularly those using public terminals to access Facebook.
"Facebook are front-and-centre in the new privacy debate just as Microsoft
were with security issues a decade ago," Cubrilovic said.
"The question is what it will take for Facebook to address privacy issues
and to give their users the tools required to manage their privacy and to
implement clear policies - not pages and pages of confusing legal
documentation, and 'logout' not really meaning 'logout'."
The Australian Privacy Commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, would not comment
specifically on Cubrilovic's findings but said generally social networking
sites need to clearly spell out when browsing information is being
collected, the purposes for which it may be used and whether it will be
disclosed to other organizations.
"Good practice would also be to allow for users to opt out of having it
collected," said Pilgrim.
The findings come after technology industry observer
Dave Winer
declared
Facebook was scaring him because the new interface for third-party
developers allows them to post items to your Facebook feed without your
intervention. This has been dubbed "frictionless sharing".
Meanwhile, Facebook's Timeline feature, which shows users a timeline of
their activity on the site throughout the years, has not officially been
switched on but many are using it already. Instructions can be
found here.
But inadvertently or by design, the Timeline feature also lets people see
which users had "unfriended" them by following a few simple steps:
-
Enable the new Timeline feature.
-
Pick a year in the timeline and locate the Friends box.
-
Click on "Made X New Friends".
-
Scroll through the list and when you see an "Add Friend" box, those are
the people either you have unfriended or vice-versa.
However, it appears Facebook has now disabled this function, describing it
to gadget
blog Gizmodo as a "bug".
Finally, security researchers were quick to
hose down a hoax that spread
through the social network, claiming that Facebook was planning to start
charging users for the new features.
Facebook Tracks Your Every Move
...Even
After Logging Out

The social media empire Facebook has unveiled
some new "features" on its platform in recent days that many allege are a
total and compete privacy-breaching nightmare.
But one hidden feature, discovered by Nik
Cubrilovic, an Australian entrepreneur and writer, that few people are
aware of is the fact that Facebook now monitors your online activity, even
when you are not logged in to the service.
With each new change Facebook makes, users' privacy becomes a little less...
nonexistent, if you will. The most recent "News Feed" modifications, for
example, display everything you say and do on the site to all of your
"friends," and even to the public.
And now, even after logging out of Facebook,
permanent "cookies" track all your movements on websites that contain
Facebook buttons or widgets.
"Even if you are logged out, Facebook still
knows and can track every page you visit,"
Cubrilovic wrote on a recent blog
posting. "The only solution is to delete every Facebook cookie in your
browser, or to use a separate browser for Facebook interactions".
But how many Facebook users will actually know
to do this?
The site has never announced to its users that
it is even tracking them in the first place, let alone given them any
instructions on how to "opt-out" of this egregious invasion of privacy.
Facebook, of course, has become infamous for simply changing
its site setup, including privacy settings, and leaving it up to users to
figure out how to contain their breached information after the fact.
It has switched from an "opt-in" approach, where
users used to be given the option to "upgrade" to new features, to a much
more complicated "opt-out" approach, where Facebook makes drastic changes
and leaves it up to users to somehow figure out how to change things back to
the way they were (if such an option is even still possible).
"While initially opt-in, the default then
seems to be expose everything," says David Vaile, executive director of
the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Cyberspace Law and Policy
Centre, concerning Facebook's "breathtaking and audacious grab for whole
life data."
"Facebook, once again, are (sic) doing things that are beyond most
users' capacity to understand while reducing their privacy... the
default setting for any site should be 'reveal nothing about me unless I
make a specific choice otherwise.'"
