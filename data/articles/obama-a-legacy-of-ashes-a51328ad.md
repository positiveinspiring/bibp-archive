From the
alternative news source
The Corbett Report
comes the new documentary 'Obama - A Legacy of Lies', a
summation of the former president's legacy which casts a
critical eye on what the film's producers characterize
as,
"eight years of
unrelenting lies and scandals".
Littered with a
cleverly edited barrage of clips sourced by the likes of
FOX News, CNN, C-SPAN and the Associated Press, the film
attempts to dismantle the narrative of President Obama
as a transformative figure of peace and prosperity
for citizens in the United States and around the world.
The filmmakers believe that the Obama mythos was birthed
early.
Desperate for hope
and change, the American public joined much of the
international community in bolstering the former
president's image before he had implemented a single
piece of substantive legislation.
The ultimate
example of this hypocrisy came in the form of a Nobel
'Peace' Prize, which was given to the president in the
earliest months of his administration.
In contrast to this
impressive accomplishment and all that it's designed to
represent, the filmmakers contend that
Obama oversaw an
unparalleled period of sustained international conflict
by the end of his two terms in office.
Evidence of this
lies in his accelerated reliance on drone warfare, the
rise of ISIS, and the continuation of the longest
running war in U.S. history in Afghanistan.
The accusations of dishonesty progress from the
battlefield to domestic concerns.
The film cites a
lack of transparency within the inner workings of the
administration, and a series of broken promises related
to the unwieldy Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as
'Obamacare.'
Negative views are
expressed on the failings of the Obama White House in
protecting the privacy rights of all law-abiding
Americans in the age of cyber terrorism.
The filmmakers also
provide an overview of the special interest groups and
individual lobbyists who they feel had an unsavory
influence over legislative priorities and the formation
of policies.
The film mounts an aggressive argument, the merits of
which are open to interpretation based upon each
viewer's particular political persuasion.
'Obama - A Legacy
of Ashes' is sure to repel the former president's most
ardent supporters while delighting his harshest critics.
