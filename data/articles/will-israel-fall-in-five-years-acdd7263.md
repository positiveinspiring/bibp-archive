"The undersigned therefore take this means of publicly presenting a
few salient facts concerning Begin and his party; and of urging all
concerned not to support this latest manifestation of fascism."
Albert Einstein

New York Times, December 4, 1948
Online reports of a study by the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) cast doubt over the survival of Israel beyond
the next two decades.
Regardless of the validity of the report, with
what is now known about the costs in blood and treasure that the
U.S.-Israeli relationship has imposed on the U.S., its key ally, Israel
could fall within five years.
For more than six decades, American support for Israel has relied on the
ability of pro-Israelis to dominate U.S. media, enabling Tel Aviv to put a
positive spin on even its most extreme behavior, including its recent
massacre in Gaza. With access to online news coverage, that Zionist bias is
becoming apparent and the real facts transparent.
Though Americans seldom show a strong interest in foreign affairs, that too
is changing. While few of them grasp the subtleties of one-state versus
two-state proposals, many have seen online the impact of a murderous Israeli
assault on Palestinian civilians that was timed between Christmas and the
inauguration of
Barack Obama.
The leaders of the 9-11 Commission acknowledged that its members would not
allow testimony on the impetus for that attack. Yet the report confirmed
that the key motivation was the U.S.-Israeli relationship. With access to
online news, more Americans are asking why they are forced to support a
colonial Apartheid government.
With the election of yet another extremist Israeli government led by yet
another right-wing Likud Party stalwart, it's clear that Tel Aviv intends to
preclude peace by continuing to build more settlements.
With that stance, Israel not only pushed Barack
Obama into a corner, it also forced U.S. national security to make a key
strategic decision:
Is Israel a credible partner for peace? By
any criteria, the answer must be a resounding "No."
That inescapable conclusion leaves Americans
with few options.
After all, the U.S. is largely responsible for
the legitimacy granted this extremist enclave in May 1948 when Harry
Truman, a Christian-Zionist president, extended nation-state
recognition. He did so over the strenuous objections of Secretary of State
George Marshall, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the fledgling CIA and the
bulk of the U.S. diplomatic corps.
By December 1948, a distinguished contingent of Jewish scientists and
intellectuals warned in The New York Times that those leading the
effort to establish a Jewish state bear "the unmistakable stamp of a Fascist
party."
Albert Einstein joined concerned Jews who
cautioned Americans.
"not to support this latest manifestation of
fascism."
Only in the past few weeks has the momentum
emerged to subject Israel to the same external pressures that were brought
to bear against Apartheid South Africa. After more than six decades
of consistent behavior - and clear evidence of no intent to change -
activists coalesced around the need to boycott Israeli exports, divest from
Israeli firms and impose sanctions against Israel akin to those it seeks
against others.
The focal point for peace in the Middle East should not be those nations
that do not have nuclear weapons but the one nation that does. Absent
external pressure, Israeli behavior will not change.
Absent pressure-and likely force-applied by the
U.S. as the nation that has long enabled this behavior, Colonial Zionism
will continue to pose a threat to peace. Occupying powers are not known to
voluntarily relinquish lands they occupy.
Likewise for their readiness to surrender
nuclear arms.
An End to Jewish
Fascism?
The key issue need no longer be a subject of endless debate. There must be a
one-state solution consistent with democratic principles of full equality.
Informed Americans are no longer willing to support a theocratic state in
which full citizenship is limited to those deemed "Jewish" (whatever that
means).
If local birth rates suggest an eventual end to
the "Jewish state," then so be it.
Why wait two decades when this nightmare can be
drawn to a close in less than five years?
Forget about a return to pre-1967 borders, instead return to pre-1948
borders. Designate Jerusalem an international city under U.N. protection and
dispatch multi-national forces to maintain peace.
Palestinians should have a right of return,
including the ability to recover properties from which they fled under an
assault by Jewish terrorists. If Colonial Zionists (aka settlers)
want compensation for "their" property, let them seek restitution from the
Diaspora that encouraged their unlawful occupation.
Those who consider themselves "Jewish" can remain as part of an inclusive
democracy. Or they can depart. Americans must consider how many of these
extremists it wants to welcome to a nation already straining under an
immigration burden.
A reported 500,000 Israelis hold U.S. passports.
With more than 300,000 dual-citizens residing in California alone, that
state may require a referendum on just how many Zionists it wishes to
receive. Likewise for Russia from which many "Jews" fled, including some
300,000 Russian émigrés who support the Likud Party but have yet to be
certified as Jewish.
Zionists originally saw Argentina and Uganda as desirable
venues to establish their enterprise. They may wish to apply there for
resettlement.
The question of why Palestinians (or
Californians) should bear the cost of a problem created by Europeans six
decades ago is one that Tel Aviv has yet to answer except by citing ancient
claims that it insists should take precedence over two millennia of
Palestinian residence.
By withdrawing Israel's status as a legitimate "state," those Jews long
appalled by the behavior of this extremist enclave can no longer be
portrayed as guilty by association. That long overdue shift in status is
certain to benefit the broader Jewish community. By shutting down Israel's
nuclear arms program and destroying its nuclear arsenal, the world can be
spared the key impetus now driving a nuclear arms race in the region.
Unless pro-Israelis can create another crisis by inducing an invasion of
Iran (or a race war), Americans will soon realize that only one "state" had
the means, motivation, opportunity and stable nation-state intelligence
required to fix the intelligence that led the U.S. to invade Iraq consistent
with the expansionist goals of Colonial Zionism.
Intelligence now working its way to transparency will soon confirm that, but
for Zionists within the U.S. government, 9-11 could have been prevented and
war in Iraq avoided.
To date, this extremism has been enabled by a
series of weak U.S. presidents.
For the U.S. to restore its credibility requires
that it not only lead the effort to shut down the Zionist enterprise but
that it also share responsibility for its behavior to date.
