# Fed to The Sharks - Fed by The FED

The FED sacrificed the foundation of
middle class wealth - stable housing values - to boost bank
profits.
Lest you think the phrase
"death of the middle class" is hyperbole, please examine
these two charts, keeping in mind the middle class by
definition must be in the middle of income/wealth
distribution - conventionally, between 40% and 80%, i.e.
the 40% between the bottom 40% and the top 20%.
See that little red
wedge?
That's the bottom 80% -
the entire middle class and everyone below the middle
class.
Here's another look at
the wealth distribution: the middle class's share of
wealth is modest, unless you define the top slice of
households just below the top 1% as "middle class."
But since the top 19%
cannot be in the "middle," attempting to boost the
wealth of the middle class by including the wealthy is
truly Orwellian.
Why has the middle class
eroded? We can start by looking at income. As noted
yesterday in FED
to the Sharks, Part 1,
household income for the bottom 90% has stagnated for 40
years.
The next chart shows how
financialization boosted asset valuations in waves of
boom and bust.
Some of the first two
waves of financialization leaked into wages, but the
FED's bubble-blowing since 2009 has failed miserably to
increase incomes:
disposable income
fell off a cliff in 2009 and has continued falling,
despite the FED's blowing new bubbles in bonds,
stocks and housing.
And when do investment
returns exceed economic growth? When the Federal Reserve
makes credit very cheap for financiers and speculators,
which drives up asset prices as everyone with access to
cheap credit bids up assets.
Low interest rates and
free-flowing credit inflate bubbles. We can discern an
implicit agenda in the FED's policy of making credit
cheap and abundant: since income for the bottom 90% is
stagnating, the only way to boost consumption and debt
is to inflate an asset owned by middle class
households: housing.
Unfortunately,
credit-driven speculative bubbles inevitably burst and
housing valuations crashed.
The FED responded to the
housing crash with an unprecedented policy of buying
over $1 trillion in home mortgages (mortgage-backed
securities), roughly 10% of all existing mortgages in
the U.S.
In conjunction with the
FED's other policies (purchasing Treasury bonds and
relaxing banking rules) and the opening of the
loose-lending FHA spigots, housing recovered nicely -
until the FED slackened the pace of its purchases of
bonds and mortgages.
Housing immediately began
trending down. In response, the FED restarted buying
Treasuries and mortgages in enormous quantities.
And sure enough, housing
recovered.
But asset bubbles do not
replace income or savings.
The only way to benefit
from bubbles in housing is to trade:
buy in at the bottom
and sell out at the top.
In essence, the FED's
bubble-blowing forced every homeowner into becoming a
speculator.
There's another agenda at
work of course: increasing debt and bank profits derived
from debt. What better way to insure banking profits
than to spark a speculative bubble in the core asset of
the middle class - housing.
Rising prices created
temporary (and enticing) home equity that could be
tapped with a loan (HELOCs - home equity line of
credit), and the temptation to selling out and moving up
the food chain to a bigger home and bigger mortgage was
equally compelling.
Even better, banks and
Wall Street had perfected the securitization of
once-safe home mortgages. Banks had no need to take on
the risk of holding mortgages - the big money was in
originating the mortgages, packaging them into
securities and selling the tranches to investors.
The much-ballyhooed
"ownership society" turned out to be ownership of debt,
not equity. Debt is profitable for banks; people owning
homes free and clear is not.
In effect, the FED
sacrificed the foundation of middle class wealth -
stable housing values - to boost bank profits. Take a
look at what happened to financial profits in the
2002-2007 housing bubble: they skyrocketed to new
heights.
And look what happened
when housing and the banks' securitization scams blew
up: financial profits completely collapsed.
Middle class wealth was
FED to the sharks.
As the current housing
bubble deflates, the investor-buyers who fueled the
rally are exiting en masse: what's the value of an asset
when the bid vanishes, i.e. there's nobody left who's
willing to pay today's prices?
The FED has failed to
restore middle class wealth with its latest housing
bubble, and the costs of the bubble's collapse will fall
not on the FED but on those who believed the recovery
was more than FED manipulation.
