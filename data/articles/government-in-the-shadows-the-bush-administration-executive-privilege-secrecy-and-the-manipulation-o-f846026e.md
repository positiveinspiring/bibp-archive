Conyers Publishes Massive Report on 'Imperial
Presidency'
Executive secrecy is one of the
monarchical customs...certainly fatal to republican government.
John Taylor
An Inquiry Into the Principles
and Policy of the Government of the United States
(1814)
The Bush Administrations cloak of secrecy
has been interwoven with many of the abuses of executive power recounted in
other sections of this Report.
This section of the Report considers the Bush
Administrations claims of executive privilege; withholding of necessary
documents and testimony from Congress without formal executive privilege
assertions; use of the state secrets privilege, the presidents
classification authority, and narrow construction of the Freedom of
Information Act.
By any measure, this Administration has been
extraordinarily secretive. In his first year of office alone, President
Bush,
delayed the release of presidential papers
from the Reagan White House, imposed limits on public access to
government documents, refused to share revised data from the 2000
Census, and shielded decades-old FBI records from scrutiny. Advisers
even declined to disclose the brand of pretzel that Bush choked on.
Criticism of the Bush Administrations secrecy
has come from across the political spectrum, including would-be allies in
Congress and conservative advocacy groups like Judicial Watch.
Larry Klayman, former chairman of
Judicial Watch, has compared the current Administration to an,
Old-World style of government, where the
sovereign is considered to be elite and the people are considered to be
the rabble, and they have little to no right to know what the government
is doing.
A simple change in administration does not
rectify all past harms when some of these expansions of Executive Branch
secrecy have been institutionalized. Steven Aftergood, Director of
the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists,
points out that,
[o]nce a precedent is set and an
administration not sufficiently rebuked, this kind of secrecy becomes a
permanent option.
In examining the Bush Administrations penchant
for secrecy, the Iraq War merits particular attention.
Beginning shortly after the terrorist attacks on
September 11, 2001, the Bush Administration built a case before Congress and
the American public for pre-emptive war against Iraq. Investigations by the
Judiciary Committees Democratic Staff, the Senate Intelligence Committee,
the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and various news
agencies subsequently revealed that the Administration had taken the use,
misuse, and tailoring of intelligence information to unprecedented lengths
in order to bolster support for the war.
The Administration also tried to silence its
critics through selective declassification of intelligence assessments and
reports by congressional committees. As Senator Bob Graham wrote in 2003,
[t]he recent scandal over the Bush
Administrations manipulation of intelligence data leading up to the war
in Iraq is a glaring example of why our government should be open and
honest with the American people.
I. Executive Privilege
A. Formal Assertions of
Executive Privilege
Executive privilege is an assertion made by the president of the United
States as grounds for refusing to produce information or documents, or for
witnesses refusing to answer questions, in response to a request or
subpoena.
The concept of executive privilege is not
mentioned in the Constitution, but is grounded in the separation of powers
doctrine.
Past presidents have argued that executive
privilege is necessary to ensure frank and candid information exchange in
the Executive Branch, and have generally used it to protect conversations
and information provided to or from the president or, in some very limited
circumstances, top presidential advisers.
Pushing the Boundaries Early On
Signs of President Bushs broad interpretation of executive privilege
appeared shortly after he first took office, beginning with two assertions
of executive privilege blocking requests for Clinton-era documents. The
first came in early 2001, when the conservative non-profit Judicial Watch
submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the Department of
Justice for documents related to pardon applications considered by President
Clinton.
The Justice Department withheld approximately
4,300 pages of responsive documents, claiming that they were exempt from
production under the presidential communications and deliberative process
privileges. Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit to obtain the documents and, on
appeal, the court rebuked the Bush Administrations attempt to expand the
presidential communications privilege to documents that were not solicited
and received by the president.
Shortly after the Judicial Watch case began, then-Chairman of the House
Committee on Government Reform Dan Burton issued a subpoena to the
Justice Department for memoranda relating to the Committees investigation
of corruption allegations at the FBIs Boston field office.
The Administration resisted the subpoena, and,
as characterized by Chairman Burton,
explained to the Chairman and Committee
staff that the Administration wished to establish an inflexible policy
to withhold from Congress all deliberative prosecutorial documents.
In December 2001, President Bush invoked
executive privilege and directed Attorney General John Ashcroft not to
produce the subpoenaed documents.
Although the dispute was eventually resolved and
the documents handed over to the Committee, the Committee report on the
matter records that,
it was clear that the Administration sought
to establish a new restrictive policy regarding prosecutorial documents
and that no demonstration of need by the Committee would be sufficient
for the Justice Department to produce the documents.
FBIs Valerie Plame Leak Investigation
In early 2007, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee opened an
investigation into the leak of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilsons
identity by White House officials.
The Committee began with a hearing on March 16,
2007, at which it heard testimony from Ms. Wilson and White House Security
Office Director James Knodell.
Mr. Knodell testified,
-
that his office never conducted an
investigation into the leak of Ms. Wilsons identity, due to the
ongoing criminal investigation
-
that senior White House officials had
failed to report their knowledge of the leak, as required by
Executive Order 12958
-
that there were no administrative
sanctions for White House officials as a result of the leak
On July 16, 2007, Chairman Henry Waxman wrote to
Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald and requested documents from his
investigation into the leak, including reports from FBI interviews of the
President and Vice President.1304 Mr. Fitzgerald produced many of the
requested documents but, at the request of the White House, withheld records
of interviews of White House officials.
Chairman Waxman appealed to the Attorney General
for an independent judgment to produce the documents and, following months
of negotiations, the request was fulfilled in part.
Despite negotiations and repeated requests by Chairman Waxman, however, the
Justice Department continued its refusal to produce the interview reports of
the President and Vice President. On June 16, 2008, the Oversight Committee
issued a subpoena to Attorney General Mukasey for those interview records.
The return date was set for June 23, 2008. In response, the Justice
Department wrote to the Committee on June 24, 2008, that it would not
provide the subpoenaed documents and mentioned the possible executive
privilege implications in the matter.
Chairman Waxman wrote to the Attorney General on
July 8, 2008, informing him that the Committee would refrain from seeking
the records of the Presidents interview for the time, but reiterating the
request for the Vice Presidents interview report and informing him that the
Committee would meet on July 16 to consider citing the Attorney General with
contempt unless the documents were produced or a valid assertion of
privilege was made.
On July 16, 2008, the Department of Justice informed the House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee that, at the Attorney Generals request, the
President had asserted executive privilege in response to that Committees
subpoena for documents related to the FBIs investigation of the leak.
Enclosed with the letter was a legal opinion
written by Attorney General Mukasey for the President, arguing that the
content of the subpoenaed documents fell squarely within the presidential
communications and deliberative process components of executive privilege,
and further contending that because the documents sought were from law
enforcement files, the law enforcement component of executive privilege
also applied. Chairman Waxmans request for a privilege log describing the
withheld documents was also refused.
In report approved by Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman
Waxman and former Ranking Member Tom Davis,
agreed that the Presidents assertion of
executive privilege over [the report of the FBI interview with the Vice
President] was legally unprecedented and an inappropriate use of
executive privilege.
The Chairman and Ranking Member explained that
the,
Vice President had no reasonable
expectation of confidentiality regarding the statements he made to Mr.
Fitzgerald and the FBI agents, and that the presidential communications
privilege that has been carved out by the courts does not cover
summaries of conversations provided to third parties.
They further rejected the Presidents privilege
claims on the basis that there is,
no precedent in which executive privilege
has been asserted over communications between a vice president and his
staff about vice presidential decision-making, pointing out the
apparent inconsistency between the privilege claim at hand and the
argument of David Addington, the Vice Presidents Chief of Staff, that
the Vice President belongs neither to the executive nor the legislative
branch.
The Bush Administrations invocation of the
presidential communications component of executive privilege was far from
surprising given the consistency with which it has defended the broad
application of the privilege. However, it was Attorney General Mukaseys
argument for the application of a law enforcement component of executive
privilege that took legal scholars by surprise.
Peter Shane, an expert on executive privilege at
Ohio State University Moritz College of Law, called the claim utterly
unprecedented, and one that he had never heard of before.
Mark Rozell, executive privilege expert at
George Mason University, called the Administrations claim an argument to
protect the White Houses own political interests and save it from
embarrassment.
The Committees bipartisan report refuted the
notion of a law enforcement executive privilege claim, noting that the
Attorney General did not cite any judicial decision recognizing it, and that
the Departments opinion memoranda that he cited applied only to open
investigations, not the Special Counsels closed case.
EPA Investigation
In 2005, California requested that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
waive federal standards for greenhouse gas emission standards for cars on
the grounds that its own state standards were more stringent.
Section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act requires the
EPA to waive federal preemption of California motor vehicle emissions
standards if Californias standards are, in aggregate, as protective of
public health and welfare as federal standards.
After a nearly two-year delay, the EPA rejected
the request. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee began
investigating allegations of political interference in the waiver decision
in late 2007 and, through interviews with EPA staff and Associate Deputy
Administrator Jason Burnett, learned that EPA career staff had unanimously
communicated to the Administrator on multiple occasions that the waiver
should be granted.
The Committee also learned that EPA
Administrator Stephen Johnson was interested in granting the waiver until he
communicated with the White House regarding the decision.
In early 2008, the Bush Administration was separately accused of improperly
pressuring the Environmental Protection Agency to weaken certain proposed
regulations affecting smog and greenhouse gas levels. The Clean Air Act
established a Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee to advise the EPA
Administrator on setting national ambient air quality standards (measured by
levels of ozone in the atmosphere).
The Advisory Committee and EPA career staff
recommended amending the standards to more stringent levels, a
recommendation echoed in the draft final rule submitted by EPA Administrator
Johnson to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on February
22, 2008.
On March 11, 2008, just hours before the final
rule was to be released, EPA staff learned that the rule was to be rewritten
to implement a less stringent standard.1326 The next day, Susan Dudley,
Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at OMB,
explained in a letter to EPA Administrator Johnson that the President had
reviewed the proposed standards and concluded that the less stringent
standard should be adopted.
On March 14, 2008, Chairman Waxman of the House Oversight and Government
Reform Committee wrote to Administrators Johnson and Dudley to request
documents relating to the ozone standards decision. Although some documents
were produced, the EPA and OMB withheld many of the documents responsive to
Chairman Waxmans requests.
On April 9 and May 5, 2008, Chairman Waxman
issued subpoenas to EPA Administrator Johnson for the outstanding documents
related to EPA communications with the White House in both cases. Chairman
Waxman also issued a subpoena to Susan Dudley for OMB documents related to
the ozone standards regulation decision.
Because the EPA and OMB continued to withhold
the majority of documents responsive to the subpoenas, the Oversight and
Government Reform Committee scheduled a vote to hold Administrators Dudley
and Johnson in contempt of Congress for June 20, 2008. The day of the
scheduled vote, Chairman Waxman received letters from the EPA and OMB
informing him that President Bush had asserted executive privilege over the
disputed documents and the vote was cancelled so the Committee could review
the privilege claims.
The June 20 letters asserting privilege both included a June 19, 2008,
letter from Attorney General Michael Mukasey to the President regarding the
basis for asserting executive privilege with respect to the Committees
investigations, arguing that the documents implicate both the presidential
communications and deliberative process components of executive privilege.
Upon review of the Attorney Generals analysis,
the Committee rejected the privilege claims:
The Presidents assertion of executive
privilege...is expansive. It covers any communications that occurred
within the White House, no matter how attenuated the connection between
the staff authoring the communications and the presidential
decision-making process.
At the same time, the Administration has
barred a key EPA official from responding to Committee questions about
these communications and has refused to provide the Committee basic
information about the authorship and distribution of the documents that
would enable the Committee to assess the merits of the privilege claim
and whether further accommodations could be achieved. The assertion of
executive privilege under these circumstances has stymied the
Committees investigation of the waiver and ozone decisions.
For these reasons, the Committee finds that
the Presidents assertion of executive privilege is wrong and an abuse
of the privilege.
On October 23, 2008, the House Oversight and
Government Reform approved by voice vote a report rejecting the Presidents
privilege claims. No additional documents were produced by either the EPA or
OMB in response to the subpoenas.
Investigation Into the U.S. Attorney Firings by
the House and Senate Judiciary Committees
The most arguably protracted fight over executive privilege during the Bush
Administration has stemmed from the House and Senate Judiciary Committees
struggle to enforce subpoenas issued in the course of investigations into
the U.S. Attorneys firings controversy that began in early 2007.1334
Before the Committees had even issued subpoenas, the President and other
Administration officials made statements suggesting that executive privilege
would be invoked in response to congressional requests for documents or
testimony. In response, the House Judiciary Committees Commercial and
Administrative Law Subcommittee held a hearing on March 29, 2007, titled
Ensuring Executive Branch Accountability.
The Subcommittee examined executive privilege
claims in the context of the U.S. Attorneys firings controversy and related
issues. The discussion among the Subcommittee members and witnesses explored
the contours of executive privilege and its potential use to block
congressional inquiry, specifically as related to the appearance of
presidential advisors for testimony before Congress.
During the hearing, Representative Hank Johnson (D-GA) asked what factors
should be taken into account in balancing executive privilege against
congressional oversight functions.
Panelist Beth Nolan, former White House
Counsel to President Clinton, responded as follows:
First of all, I would like to say that no
court has ever addressed this claim that former presidents have made,
and this president seems to be making, that White House advisors are
immune from being called to testify. There is no judicial decision on
that. The judicial decisions we do have say that executive privilege
involves balancing....
We have seen that courts may look, for
instance, in a case such as this where I think there is no question that
Congress has oversight authority with respect to these matters, then is
Congress able to obtain the information in another way. That would be
one question that you might look to.
Subcommittee Chair Sánchez asked the panelists
if Congress needed to establish a likelihood of criminal wrongdoing in the
case of the U.S. Attorney firings in order to overcome an assertion of the
presidential communications privilege, or if an indication of inefficiency
or maladministration would be sufficient.
Panelist Beth Nolan responded as follows:
"I certainly think so. If you have something
that looks like obstruction of justice, an attempt to interfere with
individual cases for reasons that really should be outside the authority
of officials to do, then I think that is exactly the kind of thing.
You are talking then about issues, whether
they are criminal obstruction of justice or whether it is simply
questions about the administration of justice, impartial execution of
prosecutorial discretion, questions that really go to the heart of the
rule of law and our criminal justice system, then I would say that not
only does Congress have the right to receive information relevant to
that, but it has a responsibility.
That is what the American people look to
Congress to do.
As previously stated, despite numerous attempts
to reach a compromise with the Administration and secure the voluntary
production of the needed documents and testimony, the Committee was forced
to issue subpoenas to former White House Counsel Harriet Miers and White
House Chief of Staff and custodian of records Josh Bolten on June 13, 2007.
On the same day, the Senate Judiciary Committee
also issued subpoenas for the White House documents as well as documents and
testimony from Sara Taylor, former Deputy Assistant to the President and
Director of Political Affairs.
On June 28, 2007, White House Counsel Fred
Fielding wrote to Chairmen Conyers and Leahy, informing them that the
President had decided to exert executive privilege with respect to the
subpoenaed White House documents and had likewise directed Ms. Miers and Ms.
Taylor not to produce any documents. The Committee later learned that the
White House also directed Ms. Miers not to appear or testify before the
House Judiciary Committee.
In the face of intransigence on the part of Administration officials to
comply with the subpoenas as noted in Section 1, the full House passed the
Judiciary Committees resolution to hold Harriet Miers and Josh
Bolten in contempt of Congress on February 14, 2008, as well as a
resolution authorizing the Judiciary Committee to file a lawsuit to obtain
the subpoenaed documents and testimony.
As the Committee explained in its report on the
Miers-Bolten contempt resolution, the Administrations expansive claims of
executive privilege were rejected on four grounds:
-
The privilege was not properly asserted
because, despite requests from Chairman Conyers, there was never a
directive personally signed by the President asserting executive
privilege. In past privilege cases, the courts have stated that a
personal assertion by the president is legally required and this
principle has been recognized in previous House contempt
proceedings.
-
The courts had previously held that a
party asserting executive privilege in response to a subpoena for
documents must produce a privilege log describing each document
being withheld. Despite requests by Chairman Conyers that the White
House produce a privilege log in an effort to reach a compromise in
the matter, no such log was ever produced.
-
The presidential communications
privilege the specific form of executive privilege that covers
communications by the president or his immediate advisors did not
apply to the information requested by the Committee. Although one
court of appeals has extended executive privilege with respect to
communications to or from some White House staff in the course of
preparing advice for the president for a decision to be made by the
president, the White House itself has maintained that President Bush
never received any advice on, and was not himself involved in, the
U.S. Attorney firings.
-
The compelling need of the House of
Representatives to obtain the subpoenaed documents and testimony
greatly outweighed the claims of executive privilege.
The White Houses claims of executive privilege
and immunity from subpoena were met with similar disagreement from legal
scholars and editorial boards. Constitutional lawyer and former Reagan
Justice Department appointee Bruce Fein wrote,
President Bushs assertion of executive
privilege to stymie the committees well-founded investigations is
wildly misplaced.
Another expert on constitutional law, Professor
Erwin Chemerinsky of Duke University School of Law, wrote to Chairman
Conyers:
From a constitutional perspective, the
claims of executive privilege are not sufficient to overcome Congresss
constitutional responsibility to conduct meaningful oversight and to
consider possible federal legislation. Simply put, this is a situation
where the claim of executive privilege is weak and the need for
congressional access to the information is strong.
In an editorial published on November 16, 2007,
after the Committee had filed its report recommending that Harriet Miers
and Josh Bolten be held in contempt but before the full House voted
on the contempt resolutions, The New York Times cautioned:
The Bush Administrations days are numbered.
But the damage it has done to the balance of powers could be
long-lasting. If Congress wants to maintain its Constitutional role, it
needs to stand up for itself. A good place to start is by making clear
that its legitimate investigative authority cannot be defied, and any
who choose to do so will pay a heavy price.
Following the Houses passage of the contempt
resolutions, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi referred the citations
to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, whose duty, according
to the statute that provides for the prosecution of contempt of Congress
citations,
it shall be to bring the matter before the
grand jury for its action.
On February 29, 2008, Attorney General
Michael Mukasey responded to Speaker Pelosi that,
the Department has concluded that the
non-compliance by Mr. Bolten and Ms. Miers with the Judiciary Committee
subpoenas did not constitute a crime, and therefore the Department will
not bring the congressional contempt citations before a grand jury or
take any other action to prosecute Mr. Bolten or Ms. Miers.
In response to the Justice Departments refusal
to enforce the contempt citations, the Committee filed a civil action in the
District of Columbia federal district court seeking a ruling that the
Administrations theories of executive privilege were legally unsound and
the enforcement of the Committees subpoenas.
As stated in Section 1, Judge John Bates
granted the Committees motion for partial summary judgment, ruling that the
White Houses claims that Harriet Miers was immune from the congressional
subpoena were invalid, and that the Administration owed the Committee a
detailed listing of the documents being withheld.
Although Judge Bates was not asked to rule on
the White Houses executive privilege claims, he did order the
Administration to produce a detailed listing of the documents being
withheld.
The Administration appealed the ruling, however,
and the matter is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia. The Administration also successfully petitioned the
appellate court for a stay of Judge Bates ruling pending the appeal, and as
of the date of this Report, the White House has still not produced any
documents in response to the Committees subpoena and Harriet Miers
has not testified.
As discussed in Section 1 of this Report, the Judiciary Committees
investigation into the U.S. Attorney firings led to an investigation of
allegations of politically selective prosecutions. On May 22, 2008, the
Committee subpoenaed former White House adviser Karl Rove to question him
about allegations that he pressured the Justice Department to prosecute
former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman and the broader U.S. Attorneys
controversy.
On July 9, 2008, the day before Mr. Rove was
scheduled to appear before the Commercial and Administrative Law
Subcommittee, his attorney Robert Luskin informed Chairman Conyers that Mr.
Rove would not comply with the subpoena, pursuant to a direction from the
President.
In a letter to Mr. Luskin, also sent on July 9,
White House Counsel Fred Fielding wrote that the White House had,
been advised by the Department of
Justice... that a present or former immediate adviser to the President
is constitutionally immune from compelled congressional testimony about
matters that arose during his or her tenure as a presidential aide and
relate to his or her official duties.
The White House argued that forcing the
President to testify before Congress would violate the Executive Branchs
status as co-equal to Congress and the separation of powers essentially
that the Presidents executive privilege protects him from any congressional
subpoena.
The White House further claimed that a
presidents advisers are an extension of the president himself his alter
ego and that therefore forcing a close presidential adviser to testify
would also violate separation of powers principles.
The Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law met on July 10, 2008,
and considered Karl Roves claim of executive privilege-related immunity.
Subcommittee Chair Sánchez ruled that,
the claims were invalid because they were not properly asserted:
-
because no court has ever held that
presidential advisers are immune from compulsory process in any
setting
-
because the claims contradicted the
practice of the Bush Administration and other administrations of
allowing presidential advisers to testify before Congress
-
because Mr. Rove had spoken publicly
about the matters the Committee wished to discuss with him
-
because the White House had previously
stated that the President had no personal involvement in the matter,
a critical element in a valid assertion of executive privilege
The Subcommittee upheld the ruling by a vote of
7-1.
On July 30, 2008, the Committee voted 20-14 to
approve a report recommending that Karl Rove be cited for contempt of
Congress by the full House of Representatives.
The Committee filed its report on September 15,
2008.
B. Withholding
Documents or Testimony Without Formally Asserting Executive Privilege
Throughout the two terms of President George W. Bush, the Administration has
on numerous occasions used threats of executive privilege or made public
statements implying that some facet of executive privilege might apply, in
order to stifle requests for information.
One of the Bush Administrations earliest applications of the principles
underlying executive privilege without a formal privilege assertion can be
found in Vice President Cheneys refusal to comply with a request by the
General Accounting Office (GAO) for information related to the
National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), consisting of
high-level federal officials led by Vice President Cheney, which was charged
with recommending a proposal for a national energy policy.
Democrats in Congress were critical of the
policy the group developed worried that it simply called for increased
drilling for oil and coal while ignoring the need for renewable energy
sources and also of the secrecy surrounding the NEPDGs deliberative
process.
On April 19, 2001, Reps. John Dingell and
Henry Waxman, then-Ranking Members of the House Energy and
Commerce and Government Reform Committees, respectively, asked the GAO
to study the NEPDG; specifically, they wanted to know the extent to which
the group consulted with representatives of energy corporations.
The Vice Presidents office repeatedly denied attempts by GAO access to
information related to the NEPDG, despite numerous attempts at accommodation
by the GAO General Counsel and Comptroller General.
On February 22, 2002, the GAO reluctantly
filed suit against Vice President Cheney, noting that it was,
the first time that GAO [had] filed suit
against a federal official in connection with a records access issue.
The district court dismissed the case on
procedural grounds on December 9, 2002.
Although the GAO did not appeal the District Courts dismissal, the
non-profit groups Sierra Club, Inc. and Judicial Watch filed suit against
Vice President Cheney to obtain information related to the NEPDG meetings.
The case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court as Cheney v. U.S.
District Court.
As former Massachusetts Special Assistant
Attorney General Joan Lukey wrote in The Washington Post:
Throughout the Cheney litigation, the
Administration took the novel position that it would not assert
executive privilege as grounds for withholding the information ...
Instead, the White House insisted on relying on the somewhat amorphous
(some might even say squishy) notion that the task force documents were
protected because the vice president was operating pursuant to his
executive powers.
The Administration therefore took the
position that if it did not assert executive privilege and the vice
president was carrying out the duties conferred on the executive by the
Constitution, the documents relating to those duties did not have to be
turned over -- and the courts did not have the right to review that
decision.
After sending the case back to the appellate
court, the Supreme Court advised the lower court to be mindful of the
burdens imposed on the executive branch in any future proceedings, thereby
implicitly rejecting the Bush Administrations contention that the Vice
Presidents activities should not be subject to pretrial discovery at all.
Eventually, the appellate court concluded that
because sub-groups of the NEPDG were not advisory committees subject to the
Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Vice President did not have to disclose
information concerning the identities of the energy lobbyists who
participated in NEPDG meetings and the extent to which their views shaped
the NEPDGs policy recommendations.
At the same time, another battle raged over the Administrations willingness
to allow the testimony of top-level officials at the hearings held by the
National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, commonly
known as the 9/11 Commission. This dispute came to a head when, in early
2004, then-National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice refused to testify
publicly before the Commission.
According to her spokeswoman, Bush
Administration attorneys requested that Dr. Rices testimony before the
Commission, a body created by congressional mandate and therefore
legislative in the eyes of the White House, would set a precedent for
legislative branch oversight over executive branch staff.
Although the Administration did not directly
assert executive privilege over the testimony, press reports and public
statements by Commission and congressional officials indicated that similar
concerns underlay the Administrations resistance.
The White Houses argument in favor of keeping Dr. Rices conversations with
the Commission behind closed doors was no doubt undercut by her frequent
appearance in the media discussing subjects that would be covered in her
testimony.
The Administration eventually reversed course
and allowed Dr. Rice to testify, but in his letter explaining the reversal,
White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales insisted,
Dr. Rices public testimony... does not
set, and should not be cited as, a precedent for future requests for a
National Security Adviser or any other White House Official to testify
before a legislative body.
On the same day as the reversal, the
Administration refused to allow Doug Badger, Special Assistant to the
President for Health Policy, to testify before the House Ways and Means
Committee in a hearing focusing on the cost of Medicares prescription drug
program.
Echoing his earlier letters concerning Dr.
Rices testimony before the 9/11 Commission, then-White House Counsel
Alberto Gonzales wrote to Committee Chairman Bill Thomas,
[i]t is longstanding White House policy,
applied during administrations of both parties, that members of the
White House staff should decline invitations to testify at congressional
hearings.
As then-Member Charles Rangel pointed
out, however, White House officials from both the Bush and Clinton
Administrations had in fact testified before congressional Committees.
Similar to the White Houses initial refusal to
allow Dr. Rices testimony, President Bush made no formal assertion of
executive privilege, but the argument by Mr. Gonzales was that public
testimony by White House staff would have a chilling effect on a presidents
ability to receive candid advice from his or her staff.
Ways and Means Ranking Member Rangel disagreed
with the White House:
Executive privilege only applies when an
official has had conversations directly with the President. In invoking
executive privilege, we must assume that the topic of withholding these
estimates was a topic of conversation between Mr. Badger and the
President himself. In any event, accounts of conversations or exchanges
between White House officials and the drug industry or members of
Congress [as was the case with the testimony sought by the Committee
from Mr. Badger] are clearly not a place where separation of powers
applies.
In response to the White Houses refusal to
allow the testimony, Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee attempted to
have the Committee subpoena Doug Badger and another witness who was
unavailable to testify at the requested time.
The Committee vote failed 23 to 16 along party
lines and, under Republican leadership, the matter ended there.
The House Judiciary Committee has also had difficulty obtaining testimony
from White House officials in matters over which the President has not
formally asserted executive privilege. As noted in Section 4 of this Report,
Chairman Conyers wrote to President Bush in advance of a July 12, 2007,
Judiciary Committee hearing on the Presidents July 2 decision to commute
former Vice Presidential Chief of Staff Scooter Libbys prison sentence.
He informed the President of the upcoming
hearing and requested that President Bush decline to assert executive
privilege and allow White House officials to testify before the Committee on
the Libby clemency. Chairman Conyers cited President Clintons decision to
allow top-level staff to testify before the House Government Reform
Committee concerning the pardon of Marc Rich as well as President Fords
testimony before the Judiciary Committee in 1974 about his decision to
pardon President Nixon.
White House Counsel Fred Fielding declined Chairman Conyerss request.
Although Mr. Fielding did not indicate that the
President had asserted executive privilege, his letter discussed and cited
an opinion memorandum written by Attorney General Janet Reno to
advise President Clinton on the legal basis for a decision to exert
executive privilege in response to a congressional inquiry on a pardon
decision.
II. Improper Use of State Secrets and
Other Authorities
A. Abuse of State
Secrets
The state secrets privilege allows the Executive Branch to prevent the
release of documents and information in litigation if disclosure would
compromise national security.
The privilege was first recognized by the
Supreme Court in U.S. v. Reynolds, and was derived from the presidents
constitutional authority to protect the Nation. In the years following
Reynolds, the state secrets privilege was used sparingly. Courts in turn
were respectfully of the Executives judgment in these areas, and in the few
state secrets cases that arose, rarely compelled disclosure over the
governments objection.
During the Bush Administration, however, invocation of the privilege has
exploded. In its first six years, the Administration raised the privilege in
almost 30 percent more cases per year than the prior administrations (and
there is no reason to believe that the rate of invocation has slowed).
According to one report,
[t]he government invoked the privilege in
only four cases between 1953 and 1976, but it has been invoked more than
20 times since the September 11 terrorist attacks and at least five
times in 2006 alone.
And beyond the simple increase in assertions,
the Bush Administration has expanded the purposes for which it invokes the
privilege.
Prior to the Bush Administration, the privilege
was used to justify the governments refusal to disclose information or to
bar certain evidence from trial. Under President Bush, however, the
Administration has urged that the privilege requires outright dismissal of
sensitive lawsuit. Indeed, the Administration has argued for this sort of
total dismissal in over 90 percent more cases than previous administrations.
Under the Bush Administration, state secrets doctrine has been invoked in
seeking dismissal of lawsuits in cases involving:
-
extraordinary rendition
-
the warrantless wiretapping program
-
post-9/11 detention of American citizens
-
lawsuits brought by former federal
employees alleging racial discrimination and retaliation, as
discussed below
Extraordinary rendition
As noted in Section 2, the state secrets doctrine has been invoked in two
cases involving extraordinary rendition of terrorism suspects. In the first
case, a German national named Khalid El-Masri sought compensation after
having been reportedly abducted by a European police force, transferred to
the Central Intelligence Agency, and then taken to Afghanistan and tortured.
Mr. El-Masri was eventually released when it
became clear that he was an innocent man and this was a case of mistaken
identity. A federal judge granted the Administrations request to dismiss
Mr. El-Masris case on state secrets grounds, accepting its assertion that
allowing the litigation to proceed would compromise national security. In
October 2007, the Supreme Court declined to hear the matter on appeal.
Mr. El-Masri wrote of his experience attending
the appellate courts argument in his case:
Although I did not understand all of the
arguments made by the lawyers, I was impressed by the dignity of the
proceedings and by the respect for the rule of law that I have always
associated with America. Im deeply disappointed to find that this same
legal system denies me the chance to fully present my case...
During my visit in November, many Americans offered me their personal
apologies for the brutality that had been perpetrated against me in
their name. I saw in their faces the true America, an America that is
not held captive by fear of unknown enemies and that understands the
strength and power of justice. That is the America that, I hope, one day
will see me as a human being not a state secret.
The state secrets doctrine also formed the basis
of the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by Canadian Maher Arar, whose case is
also discussed in Section 2. Mr. Arars request for civil compensation based
on his rendition to Syria, where he was tortured, was dismissed by a New
York-based federal court, although the matter has recently been re-argued.
In comments following the dismissal of his suit, Mr. Arar said,
[i]f the courts will not stop this evil
act, who is going to stop this administration?... The court system is
what distinguishes the West from the Third World. When a court will not
act because of national security, there is no longer any difference
between the West and the Third World.
Warrantless Wiretapping Program
As noted in Section 2, the Bush Administration has used the state secrets
doctrine to urge that cases challenging its domestic warrantless
surveillance programs be dismissed.
In the Al-Haramain case, the Muslim charity Al-Haramain Islamic
Foundation argued that it was the subject of illegal warrantless
surveillance by the government. The basis for this claim, in part, was a
document accidentally produced to the Foundations lawyers indicating that
their conversations with Foundation officials had been monitored by the
government.
Because of the accidental production, the FBI
later repossessed this document. Then the Administration argued that the
Foundations case should be dismissed because it could not prove that it had
been monitored. When the Foundation argued that the repossessed document
proved it had been monitored, the Administration then argued that the state
secrets privilege barred any mention of the document and refused to release
it or confirm its contents.
The Appeals Court hearing the case ultimately
dismissed the Foundations request for the critical document.
Employee lawsuits
The state secrets doctrine was also
relied on by the Bush Administration to prevent whistleblower Sibel Edmonds
from challenging her dismissal from the FBIs translation division. Ms.
Edmonds, hired for her proficiency in Middle Eastern languages, was fired
less than a year after she reported numerous deficiencies in the translation
process to her supervisors, including poorly translated documents from
before September 11, 2001, that had been relevant to the impending attacks.
After raising concerns about these and other
issues, Ms. Edmonds was fired. When she sued to recover her job or
compensation for what she was alleged was her improper dismissal, the
Administration successfully argued that the state secrets privilege barred
the suit.
She was also prevented from testifying in a civil suit brought by families
of 9/11 victims. The state secrets doctrine was also invoked to obtain a
dismissal of a racial discrimination case brought by former CIA agent
Jeffrey Sterling against George Tenet and other CIA officials.
The Constitution Subcommittee held a hearing on January 29, 2008, concerning
the issue of the misuse of the state secrets doctrine.
Testimony was received from:
-
H. Thomas Wells, Jr., President-Elect,
American Bar Association
-
Judith Loether, daughter of one of the
victims of the plane crash at issue in U.S. v. Reynolds
-
the Honorable Patricia Wald, retired
Chief Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit
-
Patrick Philbin, partner at Kirkland &
Ellis
-
Kevin Bankston, Senior Attorney,
Electronic Frontier Foundation
Ms. Loether testified about the death of her
father, an RCA engineer working under Air Force contract, when she was just
seven years old.
She testified that she had not known much about
the accident or the lawsuit involving her familys quest for compensation
that had ended in the United States Supreme Court. And she explained how,
years later, doing a random internet search for information on her fathers
death, she had come across the supposedly secret report that the Supreme
Court had allowed the government to conceal, which actually contained no
national security information at all.
Ms. Loether explained:
The more I understood what had happened to
my mother and why, the more betrayed I felt. It seemed that the case
that allows the Executive to keep its secrets was, at its very
foundation, a gross overstatement by the government to forward its own
purposes; to get themselves a privilege. At what cost? The cost was
truth and justice and faith in this government.
Most of the witnesses agreed that, given the
increased use of the state secrets privilege to seek dismissal of cases, it
was necessary to craft solutions that would allow for greater judicial
review of privilege claims and the requisite flexibility to fashion
appropriate orders.
In the words of Dr. Louis Fisher, Specialist in
Constitutional Law with the Law Library of the Library of Congress:
Assertions are assertions, nothing more.
Judges need to look at disputed documents and not rely on how the
executive branch characterizes them. Affidavits and declarations signed
by executive officials, even when classified, are not sufficient....What
is at stake is more than the claim or assertion by the executive branch
regarding state secrets. Congress needs to protect the vitality of a
political system that is based on separation of powers, checks and
balances, and safeguards to individual rights.
B. Abuse of Other
Authorities
Above and beyond the misuse of the executive and state secrets privileges,
the Bush Administration has used a variety of other authorities to prevent
Congress and the American public from obtaining access to information
regarding its conduct.
Although the Judiciary Committee was not able to
conduct a comprehensive review of all of these matters through oversight
hearings, it is useful to briefly inventory some of the more salient
concerns that have come to light with respect to classification authorities,
the Freedom of Information Act, the Presidential Records Act, and the Vice
Presidents Office.
Classification
Since 1940, Executive Orders have governed federal policy on the
classification of documents pertaining to national security. There are
generally three levels of classification top secret, secret, and
confidential, in order of exclusivity. In addition, certain federal
agencies have been allowed to create their own internal classification
procedures.
The Clinton Administration, under Attorney
General Janet Reno, favored a policy of transparency.
President Clintons Executive Order 12958
promoted disclosure by, among other things,
-
* limiting the duration of
classification in most cases to 10 years
-
creating a system for automatically
declassifying historical documents of significance 25 years or older
-
establishing a system for challenging
classification designations, as well as an appeals process for those
decisions
-
instilling a presumption towards lower
classification or non-classification in situations where there was
doubt as to the proper level of classification
As a result, under the Clinton Administration,
the Executive Branch declassified nearly ten times as many documents as the
historical average.
On March 25, 2003, President Bush issued Executive Order 13292, revising the
Clinton order and reversing many of its key policies in ways that encouraged
excessive classification and discouraged appropriate declassification.
Some of the key differences between the two
orders include:
-
The Bush order deleted the sections in
the Clinton order resolving doubtful classifications in favor of
lower or non-classification, allowing federal officials to classify
documents with a dubious need for secrecy.
-
Where the Clinton order used 10 years as
a default duration for most documents, the Bush Administration
allowed for an initial classification period of 25 years. While the
Clinton order limited extensions to ten-year periods, the Bush order
has no limit on extensions.
-
Under the Clinton order, documents 25
years old or more deemed by the Archivist of the United States to be
of historic value were automatically declassified, unless the
controlling agency head determined that their release should
result in one of several specific harms. The Bush order changed the
operative standard from should to could, thus dramatically
weakening the standard.
-
The Bush order strengthened other
standards in favor of withholding. Portions of the Clinton order
which had stated that information in specified substantive
categories may be classified were revised to read that such
information shall be classified.
In addition to developing general rules favoring
classification, the Bush Administration has used its classification
authority in numerous instances to protect against disclosure of potentially
unlawful or inappropriate activities.
For example, the White House attempted to
retroactively classify parts of the Joint Congressional Intelligence
Committees report on its inquiry into the 9/11 attacks that had already
been made public, including excerpts from the FBIs July 2001 Phoenix
flight-school memo previously published elsewhere, the names of senior
Administration officials, and information on anti-terror intelligence
previously disclosed in public testimony.
The Bush Administration also sought to block the
release of the Joint Congressional Intelligence Committees report. Senator
Bob Graham, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time
of the reports release, also alleged that the Bush Administration made
politically-motivated classification decisions when it shielded portions of
the Joint Committees report that raised suspicions of possible support for
some of the 9/11 hijackers by officials in Saudi Arabia.
The Bush Administration also attempted to limit the access Members of
Congress had to classified information needed to carry out their oversight
and legislative duties.
On October 5, 2001, President Bush issued a
memorandum to the heads of the State, Treasury, Defense and Justice
Departments, as well as the Directors of the FBI and CIA, instructing that
the only Members who could receive briefings regarding classified or
sensitive law enforcement information were the Speaker of the House, the
House Minority Leader, the Senate Majority and Minority Leaders, and the
Chairs and Ranking Members of the two Intelligence Committeesa group that
is commonly known as the gang of eight.
Members of both parties in both houses of
Congress decried the new policy as too restrictive and the House Defense
Appropriations Subcommittee postponed a scheduled markup of a $318 billion
defense spending bill until the new directive was reversed. Although the
President responded to the outcry by easing the restrictions and allowing
additional members to receive classified briefings, disputes between
Congress and the Executive Branch over the release of classified information
continued.
The same pattern followed with other classified information needed for
effective congressional oversight of the Administrations national security
operations. Key legal memoranda and other documents were withheld from
Members and cleared staff regarding the domestic warrantless surveillance
program, even while Members were being pressed by the Administration to
review and revise that program.
As noted in Section 2 of this Report, these
materials were eventually provided, but only when it became clear that
Congress would not provide the Administration with desired legislation
without gaining this access.
Similarly, numerous Office of Legal Counsel
legal opinions and memoranda dealing with issues of presidential power,
including those regarding the Administrations interrogation programs and
its legal views on the hostilities in Iraq were withheld despite requests
and subpoenas from both House and Senate Committees, even where the
memoranda were not classified and even were they had been superceded or
revoked.
Eventually, some access was gained to these
materials, but only after burdensome negotiations and the scheduling of
possible contempt votes in the House Judiciary Committee and the issuance of
a subpoena for Attorney General Mukaseys personal testimony on the
withholding before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
In addition, on May 9, 2008, the White House issued a Memorandum for the
Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies on the Sharing of Controlled
Unclassified Information.
This memorandum introduced Controlled
Unclassified Information as a new government category that replaced
Sensitive but Unclassified. Although the memorandum explicitly states that
the use of the controlled unclassified information label may inform but
[does] not control the decision to disclose under FOIA, lower-level staff,
seeing the label on responsive documents, may instinctively treat it as
protected and withhold it from disclosure.
The Bush Administration also used classification to hide the facts of
potentially illegal activities in its terrorist detention and interrogation
programs. The Executive has apparently classified all statements made by
terrorism suspects in detention, however innocuous. Thus, conversations
between prisoners and their attorneys were presumptively classified, even if
the information would assist in preparing the clients defense.
The Defense Department has also classified a
variety of innocuous information from conversation and correspondence with
prisoners, including poetry.
Classification procedures have also been used to withhold critical
information from defense counsel in cases involving suspected terrorists. In
military commission proceedings against Omar Khadr, the commission
reportedly issued secret orders preventing Mr. Khadrs counsel from learning
the names of the witnesses against him, thereby limiting his counsels
ability to provide a full and vigorous defense.
In a terrorism prosecution case against Dr. Ali
al-Tamimi, a D.C.-area professor convicted of inciting terrorism as part of
the Virginia Jihad Network, federal intelligence agencies have made a series
of filings secret from both prosecution and defense, prompting the judge in
the case, Leonie M. Brinkema, to state,
I am no longer willing to work under
circumstances where both the prosecuting team and defense counsel are
not getting any kind of access to these materials.
In addition, The Washington Post obtained an
order issued by Judge Stephen R. Henley, the Army colonel tasked with
overseeing the proceedings against five men accused of orchestrating the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, that imposed broad classification
rules on information related to the 9/11 trials.
In a story published January 7, 2009, the
newspaper reported that the order, which remains unavailable to the public,
in part states:
...any document or information including but
not limited to any subject referring to the Central Intelligence Agency,
National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Department of
State, National Security Council, Federal Bureau of Investigation, or
intelligence agencies of any foreign government, or similar entity, or
information in the possession of such agency, shall be presumed to fall
within the meaning of classified national security information or
document unless and until the [senior security adviser] or Prosecution
advises otherwise in writing.
The order also presumptively classifies any
statements made by the accused and allows the court to classify information
that is already publicly available, such as testimony regarding the CIAs
acknowledged waterboarding of Khalid Sheik Mohammed, one of the defendants
in the case.
Jennifer Daskal, senior counter-terrorism
counsel at Human Rights Watch, called the rules,
little more than a thinly disguised attempt
to classify evidence simply because it might be embarrassing or
unlawful, and warned, [i]f these rules applied in all cases, there
would be no such thing as an open trial in America.
FOIA Requests
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) was enacted on the premise that every
citizen has the right to access federal agency records or information.
The Bush Administration has sought to limit its
exposure under FOIA in several respects:
-
An October 12, 2001, directive from
then-Attorney General Ashcroft issued new guidelines for responding
to FOIA requests. It was a reversal of the Clinton Administrations
policy, which instructed agencies to take a broad view of their
obligations under FOIA to favor release of information unless harm
would result from disclosure. In contrast, the Ashcroft directive
instructed heads of federal agencies to identify reasons to deny
access to information by invoking one of the Acts exemptions, even
if no harm would result from disclosure.
-
On March 19, 2002, Andrew Card,
then-White House Chief of Staff, issued a memorandum advising
executive departments and agencies to use FOIA exemptions to
withhold sensitive but non-classified information. The memo also
encouraged its recipients to re-classify certain types of
unclassified or previously declassified information.
-
In contravention of the OPEN Government
Act of 2007, President Bush, in his proposed 2009 budget,
transferred the office of the FOIA Ombudsman from the National
Archives, an independent federal entity, to the Department of
Justice, which is part of the Executive Branch and ultimately
supervised by the Attorney General, a presidential appointee.
Congress had created the position in
response to the Administration policies designed to limit the volume
of documents produced in response to FOIA requests. The transfer was
initiated by the Vice Presidents office after it had engaged in an
escalating series of confrontations with the National Archives over
the Vice Presidents obligations to report his possession of
classified information.
Presidential Records Act
The Bush Administration has moved to curtail its exposure under the
Presidential Records Act, which changed the legal ownership of presidential
records from private to public and established a new statutory framework
under which presidents must manage their records:
-
On March 23, 2001, then-White House
Counsel Alberto Gonzales directed the National Archives not to
release to the public 68,000 pages of records from the Reagan
Administration that academic scholars had requested and that
archivists had determined posed no threat to national security or
personal privacy.
The Presidential Records Act required
those documents to become available January 20, 2001twelve years
after President Reagan left office.
-
When historians objected to the Gonzales
directive, stating that it undermined the Presidential Records Act,
President Bush issued Executive Order 13233. This order allows
former presidents and vice presidents, or their representatives, to
bar release of documents by claiming one of numerous privileges.
Contrary to prior law, the order
prohibits the Archivist of the United States from rejecting a former
presidents claim of privilege. The order also allows the current
president to attempt to block release of a former presidents
records even if such action subverts the former presidents wishes.
Vice Presidents Office
The Vice Presidents office has sought to limit its obligations to
accountability and transparency:
-
After declining to provide reports on
his offices possession of classified data to the National Archives
and Record Administration in compliance with President Bushs 2003
executive order, Vice President Cheney had his staff block an
attempt by the Archives Information Security Oversight Office to
perform an on-site audit. Vice President Cheney then attempted to
have the executive order amended and have the investigating office
at the National Archives eliminated.
-
Vice President also took the position
that, given his duties as tiebreaker in the Senate, the Office of
the Vice President is actually part of the legislative branch, and
not subject to executive orders.
-
In response to a Senate Judiciary
subpoena for documents relating to the warrantless wiretapping
program, the Office of the Vice President again drew a distinction
between it and the Executive, responding that the Committee
authorized the chairman to issue subpoenas to the Executive Office
of the President and the Department of Justice, but did not
authorize issuance of a subpoena to the Office of the Vice
President.
-
In a December 8, 2008, filing as part of
a lawsuit over enforcement of the Presidential Records Act
requirements, Vice President Cheney asserted that he alone may
determine what constitutes vice presidential records or personal
records, how his records will be created, maintained, managed and
disposed, and are all actions that are committed to his discretion
by law.
III. Manipulation and Misuse of Intelligence
Considerable evidence exists in the public
record indicating that President Bush and senior members of his
Administration sought to manipulate and misuse intelligence in the lead-up
to the Iraq War. Much of this information is included in the previous report
prepared for Mr. Conyers, The Constitution in Crisis.
As a threshold matter, as noted in that report,
the 2000 presidential election focused on many issues relating to domestic
and foreign policy.
However, the topic of Iraq was virtually
unmentioned in the campaign. In a presidential debate with then-Vice
President Al Gore, then-presidential candidate George W. Bush emphasized
that he would be careful about using troops for nation-building purposes
and that he would not launch a pre-emptive war because he believed the role
of the military was to prevent war from happening in the first place.
At the same time, some future members of the
Bush Administration, including high-ranking officials such as Vice President
Richard Cheney, Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee Chairman Richard
Perle and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz were part of
this group, were waiting for war with Iraq.
Immediately after the September 11 attacks, President Bush and members of
his Administration displayed an immediate inclination to blame Iraq.
-
The President asked counterterrorism
adviser Richard Clarke to determine if Saddam Hussein is linked in
any way
-
White House officials instructed General
Wesley Clark to state that the attack was connected to Saddam
Hussein
-
Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith
proposed that the U.S. select a non al-Qaeda target like Iraq.
Just a few months after the attacks and over a
year prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the Vice President appeared on Meet
the Press on December 9, 2001, and made a connection to the American public:
Well, what we now have thats developed
since you and I last talked, Tim [Russert], of course, was that report
thats been pretty well confirmed, that [Mohammed Atta, one of the
hijackers]... did go to Prague and he did meet with a senior official of
the Iraqi intelligence service in Czechoslovakia last April, several
months before the attack.
In his January 29, 2002, State of the Union
Address, the President remarked that countries like Iraq, Iran and North
Korea,
constitute an axis of evil and pose a
grave and growing danger. The President continued, I will not wait on
events, while dangers gather."
On June 1, 2002, during a speech at West Point,
President Bush formally enunciated a doctrine of preemptive military action
that would soon be used against Iraq.
It was also around this time that Vice President Cheney and his then-Chief
of Staff Scooter Libby began making a series of unusual trips to the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) to discuss Iraq intelligence.
As early as October 2002, various U.S. military
officials, intelligence employees, and diplomats charged that the Bush
Administration put intelligence analysts under intense pressure to produce
reports supporting the White Houses argument that Saddam Hussein posed an
immediate threat and that preemptive military action was necessary.
One anonymous official stated at the time,
[a]nalysts at the working level in the
intelligence community are feeling very strong pressure from the
Pentagon to cook the intelligence books.
At the same time, the Presidents public
statements asserted a reluctance to use military force in Iraq.
He assured the public that he had not made up
his mind to go to war with Iraq and that war was a last resort.1447 However,
contrary to these public statements, the Bush Administration formed the
White House Iraq Group (WHIG) in August 2002 in an apparent effort to
bolster public support for war with Iraq.
Then, in an August 26, 2002 speech to the
Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention, Vice President Cheney
began to make the case for war against Iraq when he declared,
[t]he Iraqi regime has in fact been very
busy enhancing its capabilities in the field of chemical and biological
agents. And they continue to pursue the nuclear program they began so
many years ago. In this speech Vice President Cheney went on to say we
know Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons.
The Bush Administration buttressed their claim
that Iraq had a vigorous nuclear weapons program based on statements that
Saddam Hussein had sought to acquire aluminum tubes for use as centrifuges
to enrich uranium.
On September 8, 2002, after leaked,
classified, and misleading information about the aluminum tubing had been
reported in the media Vice President Cheney and National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice both appeared on television to argue and confirm that the
tubes were part of Iraqs aggressive nuclear weapons program.
The claims concerning the tubes appear to have
been based on the views of a single CIA analyst known in press accounts as
Joe.
As The New York Times reported,
[s]uddenly, Joes work was ending up in
classified intelligence reports being read in the White House. Indeed,
his analysis was the primary basis for one of the agencys first reports
on the tubes, which went to senior members of the Bush Administration on
April 10, 2001.
Shortly thereafter, the Administration made
further alarming and sensational claims about the danger posed to the United
States by Iraq, including in a September 12, 2002, address by President Bush
to the United Nations, and began to press forward publicly with preparations
for war, calling Iraq a grave and gathering danger.
President Bush implied that the Iraqi government
would supply WMDs to terrorist when he said,
[a]nd our greatest fear is that terrorist
will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions when an outlaw regime
supplies them with the technologies to kill on a massive scale. In one
place in one regime we find all these dangers.
The President reiterated Vice President Cheneys
declarations that Iraq had an ongoing nuclear weapons program as well as
statements about the countries capacity to produce chemical weapons. In the
days following the Presidents speech to the United Nations, Iraq delivered
a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan stating that it would allow
the return of
U.N. weapons inspectors without conditions. But on September 18, President
Bush discounted Husseins offer to let U.N. inspectors back into Iraq as a
ploy.
President Bush commented on September 25, 2002,
[y]ou cant distinguish between al Qaeda
and Saddam when you talk about the War on Terror.
On September 27, 2002, Defense Secretary
Rumsfeld claimed that he had bulletproof evidence of ties between
Saddam and al Qaeda.
Shortly before the congressional vote on authorization for the war in Iraq
in October, 2002, Members of Congress sought and obtained a National
Intelligence Estimate (NIE), the coordinated assessment of the Intelligence
Community on Iraq. The NIE was made available to Members of Congress, but
not released to the public until July 18, 2003, and then only in part.
Regarding the NIE, Senator Richard Durbin of
Illinois subsequently stated the classified information he had seen did not
support the Bush Administrations portrayal of the Iraqi threat.
It's troubling to have classified
information that contradicts statements made by the Administration,
Durbin said. [t]here's more they should share with the public.
In an October 7, 2002, speech in Cincinnati,
shortly before the congressional vote to authorize military action, the
President stated:
Weve learned that Iraq has trained al
Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases... We know
that Iraq and al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a
decade.
On October 11, 2002, Congress approved a joint
resolution for the use of force in Iraq. Based on the intelligence findings
in the National Intelligence Estimate provided to Congress by the
Administration, the resolution stated that Iraq posed a continuing threat to
the United States by, among other things, actively seeking a nuclear weapons
capability.
The Presidents focus then moved on to the United Nations in an effort to
persuade the U.N. to approve renewed weapons inspections in Iraq and
sanctions for noncompliance. Once again, the President asserted his
reluctance to take military action.
Upon signing the resolution, the President
stated,
I have not ordered the use of force. I hope
the use of force will not become necessary.
On November 8, 2002, the United Nations Security
Council adopted U.N. Resolution 1441, which stipulated that Iraq was
required to readmit U.N. weapons inspectors under more stringent terms than
required by previous U.N. Resolutions.
On January 27, 2003, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
indicated that the Bush Administrations claim that aluminum tubes being
delivered to Iraq were part of an Iraqi nuclear weapons program was likely
false.
In the wake of this claim being discredited,
President Bush informed the country in his State of the Union address on
January 28, 2003,
[t]he British government has learned that
Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from
Africa.
On February 5, 2003, Secretary of State Colin
Powell took the Bush Administrations case to the United Nations Security
Council. In a presentation to the United Nations, Secretary Powell charged,
among other things, that Iraq had mobile production facilities for
biological weapons.
Secretary of State Powell stated:
I can trace the story of a senior terrorist
operative telling how Iraq provided training in these weapons to al
Qaeda.
Secretary Powell also said that,
[w]e are not surprised that Iraq is
harboring Zarqawi and his subordinates. This understanding builds on
decades-long experience with respect to ties between Iraq and al Qaeda.
Following the visit to the United Nations, the
Administration indicated its readiness and enthusiasm for going to war. Vice
President Cheney made an appearance on Meet the Press and stated that the
war would not be long, costly or bloody because the U.S. would be greeted
as liberators.
On March 18, 2003, the President submitted a
letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro
Tempore of the Senate informing the Congress of his determination that
diplomatic and peaceful means alone would not protect the Nation or lead to
Iraqi compliance with United Nations demands.
Two days later, the President launched the
preemptive invasion.
A little more than a month into the invasion, President Bush landed aboard
the USS Abraham Lincoln and, standing beneath a massive banner reading
Mission Accomplished, he stated that major combat operations in Iraq had
ended. However, it became immediately evident that this declaration of
victory was premature.
On January 28, 2004, head of the Iraq Survey Group David Kay
testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that there was no
evidence of participation by either Saddam Hussein or his principal henchmen
in the WMD-sharing with al Qaeda or any other terrorist organizations.
Dr. Kay also reported the Iraq Survey Group did
not find evidence that the aluminum tubes were intended for nuclear use and
that,
based on the evidence that was collected...
its more probable that those tubes were intended for use in a
conventional missile program, rather than in a centrifuge program.
Amid growing evidence that the case for war was
faulty, the Administration sought to preempt inquiries into the manipulation
of intelligence by launching limited internal investigations.
On February 6, 2004, President Bush created the
Robb-Silberman Commission, which later found that the intelligence community
was wrong in almost all of its pre-war judgments about Iraqs weapons of
mass destruction. However, this Commission was specifically prohibited from
examining the use or manipulation of intelligence by policymakers.
On March 16, 2004, the Democratic staff of the U.S. House Committee on
Government Reform submitted a report to Ranking Member Henry A. Waxman. This
report, titled Iraq on the Record: the Bush Administrations Public
Statements on Iraq, details public statements made by senior Bush
Administration officials regarding policy toward Iraq.
The report indicates that,
five officials made misleading statements
about the threat posed by Iraq in 125 public appearances. The report and
an accompanying database identify 237 specific misleading statements by
the five officials.
In May 2004, Bryan Burrough wrote in The Path
to War, an article published in Vanity Fair magazine, that Bush
Administration officials used repeated questioning of analysts work and
re-tasking of the same assignments to obtain intelligence assessments that
would fit the Administrations policy goals.
This dynamic was corroborated by Richard Kerr, a
former high-level CIA analyst who was brought out of retirement to conduct
the agencys classified internal review of pre-war intelligence on Iraq and
how it was used by the White House. Mr. Kerr reported,
There were people who felt there was too
much pressure. Not that they were being asked to change their judgments,
but they were being asked again and again to re-state their judgments
do another paper on this, repetitive pressures. Do it again.
Eventually the CIA Ombudsman reported that
several analysts he spoke with in the preparation of a June 2002 report on
the CIAs analysis of connections between Iraq and al Qaeda,
mentioned pressure and gave the sense that
they felt the constant questions and pressure to reexamine issues were
unreasonable.
On June 16, 2004, the National Commission on
Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9-11 Commission) held the first
session of it its twelfth and final hearing, focusing on the September 11th
plot.
At that hearing, Commission staff reported on
its investigation into the Vice Presidents allegations of meetings between
Mohammed Atta and an Iraqi intelligence official in Prague, concluding,
we do not believe that such a meeting
occurred.
The Commission cited FBI photographic and
telephone evidence; Czech and U.S. investigations; and reports from
detainees, including the Iraqi official with whom Atta was alleged to have
met.
Douglas MacEachin, a member of the 9/11
Commission staff and former Deputy Director of Intelligence at the CIA, also
testified that contacts between Iraq and al Qaeda did not constitute a,
collaborative relationship, and that the
staff had found no credible evidence that Iraq and al Qaeda cooperated
on attacks against the United States.
These findings were repeated in the final report
of the 9/11 Commission, published on July 22, 2004.
On July 7, 2004, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released its
first report in a series on intelligence in the lead-up to the Iraq War. The
Committees investigation reviewed over 30,000 pages of intelligence
assessments and source data as well interviews with over 200 officials in
the Intelligence Community (IC).
Among other things, the Senate Select
Committees 2004 Report on Pre-War Intelligence confirmed CIA assessments
that there was no evidence proving Iraqi complicity or assistance in an [al
Qaeda] attack and that contacts between the two did not add up to an
established formal relationship.
This report, along with other available
information, largely rebutted Bush Administration claims that Iraq had
acquired aluminum tubes for use in developing nuclear weapons.
The Senate Intelligence report revealed that,
the information available to the
intelligence community indicated that these [aluminum] tubes were
intended to be used for an Iraqi conventional rocket program and not a
nuclear program.
The report found that the Energy Departments
contradictory conclusions to the CIA were published on May 9, 2001, in the
Energy Departments Daily Intelligence Highlight on Intelink, a website used
by the American intelligence community and the White House. Senate
Intelligence further found that Defense Department experts also relayed
their findings that the aluminum tubes corresponded to the tubes required
for rocket use and not nuclear weapon production prior to the
Administrations September 2002 public statements.
As the war continued into 2005, with U.S. casualties approaching 1,500, Iraq
held elections on January 30. The Administration heralded the elections as a
symbol of freedom and as an event which validated the initial invasion. By
that point, however, the reason for attacking Iraq had shifted from an
imminent threat of weapons of mass destruction; to combating terrorism after
the September 11, attacks; to regime change; and eventually to promoting
democracy.
While evidence and accounts of Administration insiders strongly suggested a
predetermination to go to war and the manipulation of intelligence to
justify it, that evidence and those accounts were attacked by Administration
officials as inaccurate or biased.
Then, on May 1, 2005, the Sunday London Times
published the first in a series of important documents known as the Downing
Street Minutes. The Downing Street Minutes (DSM) are a collection of
classified documents, written by senior British officials during the spring
and summer of 2002, which recounted meetings and discussions of such
officials with their American counterparts focusing on the U.S. plan to
invade Iraq.
The Downing Street Minutes provide documentary
evidence that in the spring and summer of 2002, it was understood by the
Blair government that the Bush Administration had irrevocably decided to
invade Iraq.
These documents indicate:
-
that President Bush had told Prime
Minister Blair, when we have dealt with Afghanistan, we must come
back to Iraq (Fall, 2001)
-
that Condis enthusiasm for regime
change is undimmed (March 14, 2002)1491; that the U.S. has assumed
regime change as a means of eliminating Iraqs WMD threat (March
25, 2002)
-
that Bush wanted to remove Saddam
through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism
and WMD
-
that the intelligence and facts were
being fixed around the policy (July 23, 2002).
The Downing Street Minutes generated significant
media coverage in Great Britain in the lead up to the British elections, but
initially received very little media attention in the United States.
This circumstance began to change when, on May
5, 2005, Congressman Conyers then the Ranking Member of the House
Judiciary Committee along with 87 other Members of Congress (eventually
121), wrote to the President demanding answers to the allegations presented
in the DSM.
In his letter, Representative Conyers questioned
the President on whether there,
was there a coordinated effort with the
U.S. intelligence community and/or British officials to fix the
intelligence and facts around the policy.
On June 16, 2005, Rep. Conyers convened the
first proceeding in the United States Congress to address the serious
charges raised in the Minutes. When the Republican leadership of the House
refused to allow a formal hearing room for this proceeding, the meeting was
held in the Capitol basement.
Four witnesses appeared at this proceeding: Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson,
activist Cindy Sheehan, who lost her son Casey in the Iraq War and founded
the Gold Star Families for Peace, former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, and
attorney John Bonifaz.
Ambassador Wilson explained the importance of
the matter:
[T]he most solemn decision a government in
our democracy ever has to make is that decision to send our soldiers to
die and to kill in the name of our country. In making that decision, we
deserve a debate based on facts, not on information that is thrown into
the debate, not because it is true, but because it supports a political
decision that has already been made.
After this hearing, Mr. Conyers and other
Judiciary Committee Members personally delivered to the White House a letter
asking President Bush when he decided to attack Iraq and a petition signed
by over 500,000 Americans. The Presidents refusal to answer the Members
questions prompted the Judiciary Committee Democratic staffs investigation,
culminating in the publication of The Constitution in Crisis in August,
2006.
The following Congress, on June 5, 2008, the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence (SCCI) completed the second phase of its investigation into the
manipulation of intelligence in the lead-up to the March 2003 invasion of
Iraq. That day, the Committee released its report detailing prewar
statements by Bush Administration officials misrepresenting intelligence on
Iraq and the threat it represented to the U.S. on numerous occasions.
The Senate Intelligence Committee concentrated its analysis on statements
that were central to the nations decision to go to war.
The report examined five important speeches by
President George W. Bush and top Administration officials1498 and selected
elements that fall into the following categories: nuclear weapons,
biological weapons, chemical weapons, weapons of mass destruction, methods
of delivery, links to terrorism, regime intent, and assessments about
consequences of U.S. invasion on Iraq post-war.
Also, to support its analysis, the Committee
gathered information from intelligence reports that were produced prior to
March 19, 2003, to better understand the state of intelligence analysis at
the time of various speeches and statements.
By concentrating on inter-agency intelligence
reports, the Committee highlighted some of the disagreements with the
intelligence community and where different reporting could substantiate
different interpretations. In addition, the report focuses on the selective
use of intelligence information and the ability of the Administration to
declassify and divulge intelligence information.
The Committee report concluded that a number of public statements made by
high-ranking members of the Bush Administration in the lead-up to the Iraq
War were not supported by the available intelligence, including:
-
Statements and implications by the
President and Secretary of State suggesting that Iraq and al Qaeda
had a partnership, or that Iraq had provided al Qaeda with weapons
training were not substantiated by the intelligence. In particular,
the Intelligence Committee noted that on several occasions, the CIA
and the DIA expressed doubts that there was any collusion between
Hussein and bin Ladin because Saddam views bin Ladins brand of
Islam as a threat to his regime and bin Ladin is opposed to those
Muslim states that do not follow his version of Islam. With
regarding to weapons training, by February 2002, the Intelligence
Committee had questioned the credibility of al-Libi, the former bin
Laden aide who had sought to link Iraq with al Qaeda and weapons
trainings.
-
Statements by the President Bush and
Vice President Cheney indicating that Saddam Hussein was prepared to
give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups for attacks
against the U.S. were contradicted by available intelligence
information. In particular, the Committee found intelligence
assessments before and after the Presidents September 2002 address
consistently expressed the difficulty of trying to gauge Saddams
intentions with accuracy, and ultimately concluded that Saddam
Hussein would not likely want to risk his regimes survival by using
WMDs against the United States.
-
Statements by President Bush and Vice
President Cheney regarding the postwar situation in Iraq, in terms
of the political, security and economic, did not reflect the
concerns and uncertainties expressed in the intelligence products.
-
Statements by the President and Vice
President prior to the October 2002 NIE regarding Iraqs production
of chemical weapons omitted uncertainties as to whether such
production was ongoing. In particular the Senate Intelligence
Committee found Bush Administration officials ignored disagreements
within the IC with regard to assessments of Iraqs capabilities to
use unarmed aerial vehicles (UAVs) as delivery systems for chemical
and biological weapons. Although the October 2002 NIE indicated that
Iraq intended to outfit UAVs for such purposes, the Air Force
intelligence agency dissented. Statements by Bush Administration
officials prior to the release of the 2002 NIE also omitted IC
uncertainties with regard to Iraqs chemical weapons capabilities,
and could not confirm ongoing production of chemical weapons.
-
The statement by Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld in testimony before Congress that the Iraqi
government operated WMD facilities that were not vulnerable to
conventional airstrikes because they were buried deeply underground
was not substantiated by available intelligence information.
-
The Vice Presidents repeated claims
that Muhammad Atta met an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague in
2001 were not confirmed by the Intelligence Community. The Committee
found that by May 2002, the CIA found that there was contradictory
reporting on this trip and that it was again unable to verify Attas
reported trip through other channels; the CIA also found no
conclusive indication of Iraqi complicity or foreknowledge of the
September 11th attacks; and that in July 2002, the Defense
Intelligence Agency (DIA) indicated that there were significant
information gaps in this reporting [regarding a April 2001 Atta
meeting in Prague] that render the issue impossible to prove or
disprove.
-
With regard to President Bushs 2003
State of the Union remarks indicating Saddam Hussein had sought
uranium from Africa, the Senate Intelligence Committee identified
three important warnings that President Bush omitted. The CIA had
warned him not to use that claim because of uncertainty as to its
validity; the National Intelligence Estimate of October 2002 (NIE)
did not include this claim in its Key Judgements summary of
important points on which its conclusion of a current nuclear
weapons program was based; and the State Department found the claim
highly dubious.
On July 25, 2008, Chairman Conyers convened a
formal Judiciary Committee hearing, titled Executive Power and Its
Constitutional Limitations.
The purpose of the hearing was to further
explore the Bush Administrations abuse of executive authority, including
allegations of manipulating pre-war intelligence. The testimony from many of
the witnesses, including Representative Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and former
Los Angeles county prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, centered around the Bush
Administrations use of intelligence in making the case for war.
Representative Kucinichs testimony focused on
the role that fabricated intelligence played in justifying the war to
Members of Congress and the American public at large, arguing that the
President and Vice President knowingly misled Members of Congress in order
to convince them to authorize the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Mr. Bugliosi discussed the incomplete state of a declassified intelligence
assessment in October 2002, which became known as the White Paper.
The White Paper portrayed Husseins Iraq as an
imminent threat to the United States, but, as Mr. Bugliosi testified,
the conclusion of U.S. Intelligence that
Hussein would only be likely to attack us if he feared we were about to
attack him was completely deleted.
The omission made Prime Minister Hussein appear
much more dangerous.
Former Judiciary Committee member Elizabeth
Holtzman also testified, and described her conclusion that,
[t]he deceptions, exaggerations and
misstatements made by high level Administration officials to drive the
country into the tragically mistaken Iraq War subvert the constitution.
In his book released August 5, 2008, The Way
of the World: A Story of Truth and Hope in an Age of Extremism, author
Ron Suskind reported that White House officials had directed the fabrication
of a letter in the name of Saddam Husseins former Intelligence Chief Tahir
Habbush that suggested a link between Iraq and Mohammed Atta.
On August 20, 2008, Chairman Conyers wrote the
key Administration insiders alleged to be involved in the matter:
-
George Tenet, former Director of the CIA
-
Rob Richer, former CIA Deputy Director
of Clandestine Operations and Chief of the Near East Division
-
John Maguire, one of the heads of the
CIAs Iraq Operations Group in the Near East Division
-
A.B. Buzzy Krongard, former Executive
Director of the CIA
-
John Hannah, Assistant to the Vice
President for National Security Affairs
-
Lewis I. Scooter Libby, former Chief
of Staff to the Vice President
No information was obtained in response to these
letters that confirmed the recipients knowledge of the forgeries.
Accordingly, the Administration figures who ordered and authored the
apparent forgery and their involvement in leaking it through foreign
intelligence channels remain unidentified.
In December 2008, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Chairman of the Committee
on Oversight and Government Reform, released a memorandum revealing that, in
apparent contrast to assurances given by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales
to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in a 2004 letter, the CIA had
in fact objected to the statement by President Bush in his 2003 State of the
Union speech regarding Saddam Hussein seeking uranium from Africa.
John Gibson former Director of Speechwriting for
Foreign Policy at the National Security Council (NSC) indicated that he
attempted to insert the claim about African uranium in a September 12, 2002,
speech being written for President Bush to give to the United Nations. Mr.
Gibson stated that he was never able to clear the language with the CIA
because the agency was concerned about the informations reliability.
Similarly, a few weeks later, a high level CIA
official had contacted then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice
personally to express the CIAs position that the statement was not credible
and should be taken out of a speech that President Bush was preparing to
deliver on September 26, 2002.
In the final weeks of 2008 and of their second term, President Bush and Vice
President Cheney gave a series of interviews in which they have discussed
the lead-up to and execution of the war in Iraq. Speaking with Jonathan Karl
of ABC News, Vice President Cheney disagreed with the assessment Karl Rove
that had the pre-war intelligence been correct, the U.S. would not have
invaded Iraq.
Vice President Cheney insisted that what they
got wrong was that there werent any stockpiles.
In an interview with Martha Raddatz of
ABC News, President Bush spoke of the relationship between al Qaeda
and Iraq:
Mr. Bush: Clearly, one of the most important
parts of my job because of 9/11 was to defend the security of the
American people. There have been no attacks since I have been president,
since 9/11. One of the major theaters against al Qaeda turns out to have
been Iraq. This is where al Qaeda said they were going to take their
stand. This is where al Qaeda was hoping to take ...
Ms. Raddatz: But not until after the U.S. invaded.
Mr. Bush: Yeah, thats right. So what?
President Bush went on to insist that he,
did not have the luxury of knowing [Saddam
Hussein] did not have [weapons of mass destruction], neither did the
rest of the world until after we had come and removed him.
IV. Findings
Expansion of Executive
Privilege
-
On numerous occasions, the Bush
Administration has significantly delayed or entirely refused the
production of documents or congressional testimony by Executive
Branch officials by claiming that such productions would infringe
upon executive privilege.
President Bush has not only vastly
expanded the notion of executive privilege and its applications, but
also has used executive privilege claims as a means of stonewalling
congressional investigations.
Subpoenas not complied with include:
-
An April 25, 2007, House Oversight
and Government Reform Committee subpoena for the testimony of
the Secretary of State regarding alleged Niger document
forgeries

Counsel Harriet Miers and documents concerning the o U.S.
Attorneys firings investigation
-
A June 13, 2007, Senate Judiciary
Committee subpoena for the testimony of White House Chief of
Staff Joshua Bolten and documents concerning the U.S. Attorneys
firings investigation
-
A June 13, 2007, House Judiciary
Committee subpoena to Robert Duncan, RNC Chairman, as custodian
of record, for documents;
-

greenhouse gas emission standards
-
The April 9, 2008, and May 5, 2008,

Government Reform Committee subpoena to Attorney General Mukasey
concerning FBI interview reports with President Bush and Vice
President Cheney regarding the outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame
-

Committee subpoena to Attorney General Mukasey for documents
previously requested from the Department of Justice concerning
withheld OLC opinions, FBI interviews of President Bush and Vice
President Cheney regarding the outing of Valerie Plame, and
internal Justice Department documents concerning the Siegelman
and Wecht prosecutions.
-
An October 21, 2008, Senate
Judiciary Committee subpoena to Attorney General Mukasey for
documents pertaining to legal analysis and advice provided by
the Department of Justices Office of Legal Counsel regarding
the Bush Administrations terrorism policies, including
detention and interrogation polices and practices.
State Secrets Privilege
-
In contrast to assertions of state
secrets privilege under previous administrations, the Bush
Administration invoked the privilege to dismiss cases challenging
specific ongoing government programs and prevented disclosure of
potentially unlawful conduct by the Administration itself.
These assertions have prevented
disclosure of potentially unlawful conduct by members of the Bush
Administration, including:
-
Invocation of the state secrets
privilege resulted in the dismissal of a wrongful termination
lawsuit brought by former FBI agent and whistleblower Sibel
Edmonds. In an investigation taking place at the same time, the
FBIs Inspector General determined that Sibel Edmonds had been
improperly dismissed and that her charges had never been
properly investigated.
-
Invocation of the state secrets
privilege resulted in the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by
Khalid el-Masri, preventing judicial review of the legality of
the Administrations rendition programming.
-
Invocation of the state secrets
privilege resulted in the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by
Maher Arar, preventing judicial review of the legality of the
Administrations rendition programming.
-
Invocation of the state secrets
privilege resulted in the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by the
Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, preventing judicial review of
the legality of the Administrations warrantless wiretapping
program.
-
Invocation of the state secrets
privilege resulted in the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by the
ACLU, preventing judicial review of the legality of the
Administrations warrantless wiretapping program.
-
Invocation of the state secrets
privilege resulted in the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, preventing judicial review of
the legality of the Administrations warrantless wiretapping
program.
-
Invocation of the state secrets
privilege resulted in the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by the
Center for Constitutional Rights, preventing judicial review of
the legality of the Administrations warrantless wiretapping
program.
Abuse of Classification and
Other Authorities
-
The Bush Administration has misused
authority with regard to the classification of documents under the
Freedom of Information Act, the Presidential Records Act, and the
Vice Presidents Office to deny or delay the release of information
to Congress and the public, potentially covering up misconduct by
the Bush Administration.
-
Executive Order 13292 issued by
President Bush reversed many key policies mitigating in favor of
declassification, including providing for longer periods of time
for declassification and weakening the standards for
declassification.1546
-
FOIA was significantly weakened
under the Bush Administration as a result of:
-
a 2001 directive by
then-Attorney General Ashcroft encouraging agency heads to
deny FOIA requests even if no harm would result from
disclosure
-
2002 and 2008 White House
memoranda which encouraged denying FOIA claims for
sensitive but unclassified information and using the
newly-created controlled unclassified information
designation to inform (but not control) the decision
whether to release information to the public
-
the transfer in the
Administrations proposed fiscal year 2009 budget of the
newly-created FOIA Ombudsman position from the independent
National Archives to the Department of Justice, which is
part of the Executive Branch.
-
Executive Order 13233 issued by
President Bush weakens the Presidential Records Act by allowing
former presidents and vice presidents to bar release of
documents by claiming one of numerous privileges.1548
-
The Vice Presidents Office sought
to treat itself as an entity not subject to Executive Branch
disclosure obligations, and denied information to the Archivist
and tried to have the Archivists investigating office
eliminated.
Manipulation and Misuse of
Intelligence
-
A decision had been made to invade Iraq
while President Bush and senior members of his Administration
continued to make statements that a decision had not been made to
invade.
-
President Bush and senior members of
his Administration made numerous statements to the effect that
no decision had been made to go to war with Iraq. For example,
as early as September 8, 2002, Vice President Cheney insisted
that no decisions been made yet to launch a military
operation, and as late as March 6, 2003, President Bush
declared Ive not made up our mind about military action.
-
The Downing Street Minutes provided
unrebutted documentary evidence that by the spring and summer of
2002, the Blair government had reason to believe that the Bush
Administration had made an irrevocable decision to invade Iraq.
Among other things, the leaked
documents revealed that President Bush had told Prime Minister
Blair,
-
when we have dealt with
Afghanistan, we must come back to Iraq (Fall, 2001)
-
Condis enthusiasm for regime
change is undimmed (March 14, 2002)
-
the U.S. has assumed regime
change as a means of eliminating Iraqs WMD threat (March
25, 2002)
-
Bush wanted to remove Saddam
through military action, justified by the conjunction of
terrorism and WMD and the intelligence and facts were
being fixed around the policy (July 23, 2002).
-
President Bush and senior members of his
Administration made unsubstantiated, if not false, claims linking
Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda.
-
Members of the Bush Administration,
including the President, made a number of statements linking
Saddam Hussein to the events of September 11 and to al Qaeda.
For example, President Bush commented on September 25, 2002,
You cant distinguish between al Qaeda and Saddam when you talk
about the War on Terror; and on September 27, 2002, Secretary
Rumsfeld claimed that he had bulletproofevidence of ties
between Saddam and al Qaeda.
However, the 2008 Senate
Intelligence Committee Report found that on several occasions,
the CIA and the DIA expressed doubts that there was any
collusion between Hussein and bin Ladin because Saddam views
bin Ladins brand of Islam as a threat to his regime and bin
Ladin is opposed to those Muslim states that do not follow his
version of Islam.
Moreover, the 9-11 Commission
concluded that it had found no collaborative relationship
between Iraq and al Qaeda and that [w]e have no credible
evidence that Iraq and al Qaeda cooperated on attacks against
the United States.
-
Vice President Cheney made
unsubstantiated, if not false, claims specifically linking Iraq
with the September 11 hijacker Muhammad Atta.
Vice President Cheney appeared on
Meet the Press on December 9, 2001, and stated:
-
Well, what we now have thats
developed since you and I last talked, Tim [Russert], of
course, was that report thats been pretty well confirmed,
that [Mohammed Atta, one of the hijackers]... did go to
Prague and he did meet with a senior official of the Iraqi
intelligence service in Czechoslovakia last April, several
months before the attack.
Subsequently, the 9-11 Commission
addressed the Vice Presidents allegations of meetings between
Atta and Iraqi intelligence, concluding, We do not believe that
such a meeting occurred.
-
Both President Bush and Secretary of
State Powell made unsubstantiated, if not false, claims that
Iraq had trained al Qaeda members to use chemical and biological
weapons.
In his October 7, 2002, speech in
Cincinnati, the President stated: Weve learned that Iraq has
trained al Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly
gases, and in his February 5, 2003, speech before the UN,
Secretary of State Powell stated:
These allegations were based on
disclosures by Ibu al-Shaykh al-Libi, an aide to bin Laden in
U.S. custody.
However, the 2008 Senate
Intelligence Committee reported noted that by February of 2002,
intelligence sources began to question al-Libis credibility,
with a DIA defense intelligence report finding,
-
President Bush made unsubstantiated,
if not false, claims that Iraq would supply weapons to terrorist
groups.
During his September 12, 2002,
speech to the United Nations General Assembly, President Bush
indicated that the Iraqi government would supply WMDs to
terrorist when he said,
However, according to the 2008
Senate Intelligence report, intelligence assessments before and
after the Presidents September 2002 address consistently
expressed the difficulty of trying to gauge Saddams intentions
with accuracy.
-
President Bush and senior members of his
Administration made unsubstantiated, if not false, claims concerning
Iraqs alleged nuclear weapons program.
-
President Bush and other senior
members of his Administration made unsubstantiated, if not
false, claims that Iraq had acquired uranium from Africa. In his
2003 State of the Union Address, President Bush told the
country,
However, in their 2008 report, the
Senate Intelligence Committee disclosed that the CIA had warned
the President not to use that claim because of uncertainty as to
its validity, and the State Department found the claim highly
dubious. In addition, in December of 2008, the Oversight and
Government Reform Committee disclosed a memorandum indicating
that the Presidents statement regarding uranium had not been
cleared by the CIA.
-
President Bush and senior members of
his Administration made unsubstantiated, if not false, claims
that Iraq was using aluminum tubes to assist in making nuclear
weapons.
On September 8, 2002, Vice President
Cheney and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice both
appeared on television to argue and confirm that the tubes were
part of Iraqs aggressive nuclear weapons program. President
Bush would later state in his 2003 State of the Union Address
that Saddam Hussein was trying to buy tubes suitable for
nuclear weapons production.
However, the July 2004 report by the
Senate Intelligence Committee revealed that, at the time,
-
Senior members of the Bush
Administration placed undue pressure on intelligence officials in
order to obtain intelligence assessments that aided their efforts to
make the case for invading Iraq.
-
As early as October 2002, an
anonymous intelligence official stated, Analysts at the working
level in the intelligence community are feeling very strong
pressure from the Pentagon to cook the intelligence books.
Richard Kerr, a former high-level
CIA analyst who conducted the agencys classified internal
review of pre-war intelligence on Iraq and how it was used by
the White House, reported,
-
There were people who felt
there was too much pressure. Not that they were being asked
to change their judgments, but they were being asked again
and again to re-state their judgments-do another paper on
this, repetitive pressures. Do it again."
