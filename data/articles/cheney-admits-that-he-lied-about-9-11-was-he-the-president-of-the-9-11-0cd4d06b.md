Cheney Admits
He Was the President of
the 9/11...

The World According To
Dick Cheney
Mr. Cheney
kept 'W.' (George
W. Bush) flying aimlessly in the air on 9/11 while he and Lynne left on a
helicopter for a secure undisclosed location, leaving Washington in a
bleak, scared silence, with no one reassuring the nation in those first
terrifying hours.
I gave
the instructions that wed authorize our pilots to take it out, he
says, referring to the jet headed to Washington that crashed in a
Pennsylvania field.
He adds:
After Id given the order, it was
pretty quiet. Everybody had heard it, and it was obviously a
significant moment.
***
When they testified together before the 9/11
Commission, W. and Mr. Cheney kept up a pretense that
in a previous call, the president had authorized the vice president to
give a shoot-down order if needed. But the commission found no
documentary evidence for this call.
In other words, Cheney pretended that Bush had
authorized a shoot-down order, but Cheney now admits that he never did. In
fact, Cheney acted as if he was the president on 9/11. *
* Indeed, Cheney
initiated Continuity of Government plans on 9/11 which
essentially nullified Americas constitutional form of government.
Cheney lied about numerous other facts related
to 9/11 as well. For example, Cheney:
-
Falsely
linked Iraq with 9/11 (indeed,
the entire torture program was aimed at establishing such a false linkage; and
Cheney is the guy who
pushed for torture,
pressured the Justice Department lawyers to write memos
saying torture
was legal, and
made the pitch to Congress
justifying torture. The former director
of the CIA said
Cheney oversaw American torture policies)
-
Falsely claimed that spying on
Americans, torture, the Patriot Act, the Afghanistan war, the Iraq war
and the war on terror were all necessitated by 9/11
when
all of them started
or were planned before 9/11
-
Falsely
stated that an attack such as 9/11 was unforeseeable, when Al Qaeda
flying planes into the World Trade Center and Pentagon was something
which American military and intelligence services - and our allies -
knew could happen
-
Falsely
pretended that he was out of the loop during the 9/11
attacks
-
Falsely
blamed others for 9/11, when Cheney was in charge of all of
Americas counter-terrorism exercises, activities and responses on 9/11.
See
this Department of State announcement and
this CNN article
-
And when Cheney was apparently
responsible for letting the Pentagon get hit by an airplane
(confirmed
in below video)
-
And was instrumental in
squashing a real investigation into 9/11
Vice-president Dick Cheney Comes Clean
- He Was The Real
President, and He Stands By All of His Mistakes -

Dick Cheney certainly gives certainty a
black eye.
In a documentary soon to appear on Showtime, The World According to Dick
Cheney, Americas most powerful and destructive vice president woos history
by growling yet again that he was right and everyone else was wrong.
R.J. Cutler, who has done documentaries on the Clinton campaign war room
and Anna Wintours Vogue war paint room, now chronicles Cheneys war boom.
If I had to do it over again, the 72-year-old says chillingly of his reign
of error, Id do it over in a minute.
Cheney, who came from a family of Wyoming Democrats, says his conservative
bent was strengthened watching the anti-Vietnam war protests at the
University of Wisconsin, where he was pursuing a doctorate and dodging the
draft.
I can remember the mime troupe meeting there and the guys that ran around
in white sheets with the entrails of pigs, dripping blood, he said.
Maybe
if hed paid more attention to the actual war, conducted with a phony casus
belli in a country where we did not understand the culture, he wouldnt have
propelled America into two more Vietnams.
The documentary doesnt get to the dark heart of the matter about the
man
with the new heart.
-
Did he change, after the shock to his body of so many heart procedures and
the shock to his mind of 9/11?
-
Or was he the same person, patiently playing
the courtier, once code-named Backseat by the Secret Service, until he
found the perfect oblivious frontman who would allow him to unleash his
harebrained, dictatorial impulses?
Talking to Cutler in his deep headmasters monotone, Cheney dispenses with
the fig leaf of we.
He no longer feigns deference to 'W.'
(George
W. Bush), whom he now
disdains for favoring Condi over him in the second term, and for not
pardoning Cheneys Cheney, Scooter Libby.
I had a job to do, he said.
Continuing:
I got on the telephone with the president, who was in Florida,
and told him not to be at one location where we could both be taken out.
Cheney kept W. flying aimlessly in the air on 9/11 while he and Lynne left
on a helicopter for a secure undisclosed location, leaving Washington in a
bleak, scared silence, with no one reassuring the nation in those first
terrifying hours.
I gave the instructions that wed authorize our pilots to take it out, he
says, referring to the jet headed to Washington that crashed in a
Pennsylvania field. He adds: After Id given the order, it was pretty
quiet. Everybody had heard it, and it was obviously a significant moment.
This guy makes Al Haig look like a shrinking violet.
When they testified together before the 9/11 Commission, W. and Cheney kept
up a pretense that in a previous call, the president had authorized the vice
president to give a shoot-down order if needed.
But the commission found no
documentary evidence for this call.
In his memoir, W. described feeling blindsided again and again. In this
film, the blindsider is the Ã©minence grise who was supposed to shore up the
untested president. The documentary reveals the Iago lengths that Cheney
went to in order to manipulate the unprepared junior Bush.
Vice had learned
turf fighting from a maniacal master of the art, his mentor Donald Rumsfeld.
When he was supposed to be vetting vice presidential candidates, Cheney was
actually demanding so much material from them that there was always
something to pick on. He filled W.s head with stories about conflicts
between presidents and vice presidents sparked by the vice presidents
ambition, while protesting that he himself did not want the job.
In an unorthodox move, he ran the transition, hiring all his people,
including Bush seniors nemesis, Rummy, and sloughing off the Friends of
George; then he gave himself an all-access pass.
He was always goosing up W.s insecurities so he could take advantage of
them. To make his crazy and appallingly costly detour from Osama to Saddam,
and cherry-pick his fake case for invading Iraq, he played on W.s fear of
being lampooned as a wimp, as his father had been.
But after Vice kept W. out of the loop on the Justice Departments rebellion
against Cheneys illegal warrantless domestic spying program, the
relationship was ruptured.
It was too late to rein in the feverish vice
president, except to tell him he couldnt bomb a nuclear plant in the Syrian
desert.
Condi was on the wrong side of all those issues, Cheney rumbled to Cutler.
Cheney still hearts waterboarding.
Are you going to trade the lives of a
number of people because you want to preserve your honor? he asked, his
voice dripping with contempt.
I dont lie awake at night thinking, gee, what are they going to say about
me? he sums up.
Theyre going to say you were a misguided power-monger who, in a paranoid
spasm, led this nation into an unthinkable calamity.
Sleep on that...
