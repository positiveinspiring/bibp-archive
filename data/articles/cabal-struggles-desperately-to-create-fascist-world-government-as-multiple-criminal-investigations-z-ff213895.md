The fascist cabal known as
the Bilderbergers,
CFR,
Committee of 300 etc., is desperately and
without hope trying to start WW3 and install a fascist world government in
an attempt to pre-empt criminal investigations closing in on them from all
sides.
Their efforts will fail because the Pentagon and
the agencies in the U.S. (with the exception of homeland Gestapo) are
preparing to remove them from power, according to CIA and other sources.
For example, multiple investigations are closing
in on alleged President
Obama, including one for illegally
declaring
war on Libya.
A count among U.S. representatives show the
votes necessary to impeach him are there, U.S. law enforcement officials
say. In addition, evidence of bribery and other forms of illegally tampering
with government is being compiled against
George Soros, among others. There is
also a lot going on under and on the surface in Europe, Japan and the Middle
East.
In Europe, an agreement was reached by most countries, including the 17 in
the Eurozone, to agree to cede national sovereignty over fiscal policy in
order to protect the Euro. This is all part of a long planned central power
grab by unelected secret Khazarian groups that was meant to be a major
milestone on the road to a global fascist regime. Create the crisis, offer
the solution.
In the U.S., as mentioned last week, the Obama regime has asserted
the right to murder and imprison Americans without due process,
meaning he has declared the U.S. to be a fascist dictatorship. Again, it
looks on the surface like the plans for a world fascist government are
proceeding smoothly.
Fortunately for the rest of the human race, the fascist power grab is really
just a sign of desperation.
The EU, agreement, for example, is like a dead-beat borrower promising to be
good in the future saying:
Now that I have agreed to German autocratic
control could I have some money please?
The answer remains,
Sure, just borrow from the Germans.
The Germans, of course, do not have enough
money.
As mentioned before, the Euro zone still needs
money from the rest of the world in order to stabilize its financial
situation and that money will not be forthcoming until more fundamental
problems with the global system, such as 1.1 billion hungry people and
rampant environmental destruction, are dealt with.
The upcoming belt-tightening, however, is a
healthy process that will be good for Europe in the medium to long term.
Living within your means is always a wise policy for both individuals and
nations.
The fact of the matter is that the European financial elites have been
hogging the worlds financial assets since the end of World War 2 and have
been plotting genocide so they are not going to get any money. End of story.
The UK was the only nation to veto the new EU treaty because the interests
of the City of London financial district and the average citizen happened to
coincide. The City did not want a financial transaction tax because it would
gut their business and the average Britton was not willing to surrender to
the Germans.
The situation in the U.S. is a bit more complicated. The problem is that
almost the entire leadership structure
in Washington D.C. is corrupt and
compromised but people in the pentagon and the agencies are so used to
taking orders they do not know what to do when their leaders become
dysfunctional.
For example, there are enough votes in the U.S. Congress and Senate now to
impeach Obama but the problem is nobody can agree on a replacement.
The various corruption investigations against the Obama regime can remove
him from power but nobody knows what to do next. The only answer is for the
military to set up a temporary government headed by the Joint Chiefs of
Staff until the garbage can be removed from Washington D.C. and Wall Street.
The military rightly claim that armies are not
good at governing. However, they are good at cleaning up a mess and
restoring constitutional order.
The U.S. military also worry about being able to meet the payroll but the
backers of the new financial system have already promised generous financing
to ensure a restoration of U.S. economic might and a gradual transition of
the military industrial complex into something that can be self-supporting
and good for the planet.
In any case,
the Khazarian Satanic bankers in both
Europe and the U.S. are being cut off from their credit by the rest of the
world. Since the only product they know how to create is debt, that means
that without somebody gullible enough to provide them with credit, they have
nothing but illusion to offer.
These debts they claim the rights to are not
owed by the people of Europe or the U.S. because they were never anything
but illusions placed upon them by rapacious bankers. No matter how many
zeros and how many astronomical numbers they invent to put into their
banking computers, there is simply nothing in the real world to back them
up.
Their efforts to take over the rest of the world outside of the EU and the
U.S. are also failing big time. The sham attempt to sabotage Russian
Parliamentary elections with paid saboteurs got nowhere. Efforts to
start
World War 3 in Iran continue to be blocked.
Attempts to get money from Asia to finance the Satanic cabalists are also
going nowhere.
According to a CIA representative, a senior
member of
the Du Pont family and a
Rothschild representative are in Indonesia
trying to get access to rights for Asian treasure but are getting nowhere.
In Japan too, there is a desperate attempt to re-establish Khazarian
control.
-
democratic Party of Japan power broker
and
Rockefeller stooge Ichiro Ozawa
-
police corruption beneficiary Shizuka
Kamei
-
corrupt Tokyo mayor Shintaro Ishihara,
...are trying to drum up support for a new
political party.
They have been sucking up to recently elected
and very popular Osaka mayor Toru Hashimoto.
The plan seems to be to use the nuclear fear
they are fanning in Tokyo to promote a shift of government functions to
Osaka. That, of course, would mean a lot of construction contracts and other
means to bribe the Japanese political elite back into submission.
It is such a pathetic plan that more than
anything it shows how desperate these hoodlums have become.
