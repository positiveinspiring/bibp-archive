# U.S. Intelligence Planned To Destroy WikiLeaks

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_wikileaks01.htm

"This document is a classified (SECRET/NOFORN),
32-page US counterintelligence investigation
into WikiLeaks.
'The possibility that current employees
or moles within DoD or elsewhere in the US government are providing
sensitive or classified information to Wikileaks.org cannot be ruled
out.'
It concocts a plan to fatally marginalize
the organization.
Since WikiLeaks uses,
'trust as a center of gravity by
protecting the anonymity and identity of the insiders, leakers or
whistleblowers,' the report recommends 'The identification,
exposure, termination of employment, criminal prosecution, legal
action against current or former insiders, leakers, or
whistleblowers could potentially damage or destroy this center of
gravity and deter others considering similar actions from using the
Wikileaks.org Web site.'
[As two years have passed since the date
of the report (March 18, 2008), with no WikiLeaks' source exposed,
it appears that this plan was ineffective.]
As an odd justification for the plan, the
report claims that,
'Several foreign countries including
China, Israel, North Korea, Russia, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe have
denounced or blocked access to the Wikileaks.org website.'
The report provides further justification by
enumerating embarrassing stories broken by WikiLeaks:
-
US equipment expenditure in Iraq
-
probable US violations of the
Chemical Warfare Convention Treaty in Iraq
-
the battle over the Iraqi town of
Fallujah
-
human rights violations at
Guantanamo Bay"
