Full interview General Wesley Clark with Democracy Now!
Last night, as I reflected on my recent three-part series filled with bold predictions, I began to question whether or not I was being too negative.
Upon hearing Trumps Iran speech today, I became convinced that everything I wrote had merit. The speech was downright terrifying, serving to confirm all my worst fears about what hes up to in the Middle East. Theres no way you can listen to that disingenuous rant and not recognize that hes already made up his mind about war with Iran.
What comes next will be a series of U.S. imposed redlines and demands, which Iran will eventually be said to violate, at which point the U.S. will escalate bigly. I expect the most wretched cretins in America to rally behind the coming war push, including much of the corporate media. We already saw evidence of this earlier today.
What did I tell you. All the biggest hacks in America are going to come out and push this Iran war. https://t.co/VBbRxGVLeVâ€” Michael Krieger (@LibertyBlitz) October 13, 2017

Many of you will accuse me of exhibiting unwarranted confidence about where all this is headed, but its not that. The reason I feel so strongly about this forecast is because war with Iran has been planned for decades.
For proof, take a watch of this classic video of General Wesley Clark explaining the foreign policy establishments post 9/11 plans:

Todays speech by Trump makes me even more confident regarding what I wrote over the past few days. Read "Empire Destroying Wars are Coming to America Under Trump".
