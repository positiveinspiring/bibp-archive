George Soros knows something dreadful is coming.
The
Rockefellers know something big and bad is about to happen. That something
big is the imminent collapse of all fiat, paper money currencies around the
world.
In their
secret Bilderberg meetings, the globalists have positively
planned the exact date of our financial demise. You can even bet the next
black whatever day will coincide with an ironic date which will make the
globalists chuckle at the planned inception of next false flag event.
You
remember when the globalist minions crashed planes into the World Trade
Center buildings on 9/11. The globalists
planned a 911 event on 9/11. Get
it? LOL!!! Three thousand dead means nothing to the globalists.
Nobody else but these psychopathic criminals, will be
laughing when they roll out their financial collapse plan. And
unfortunately, you and I do not have a seat at the table so we have no
insider information to gauge when the financial collapse is coming.
Just
like 1929, most of us will have the lions share of our liquid assets (e.g.
cash) in their criminal banks when the collapse occurs.
However, there are
some things that we can all watch out for.
Timing Is Everything
Although most of us do not have insider information there are
indeed some tell tale signs that we can look for what could serve as
warnings as to when the collapse will occur.
It is more accurate to expect
the collapse to be hinged on events rather than trying to pick a date on the
calendar.
First, we will soon begin to witness more controls placed on
the amount of withdrawals which can be taken from ATMS and savings accounts
in addition to what has already transpired. And we will witness more MF
Global type of events in the coming weeks.
Expect MERS mortgage fraud to
increase as the globalists will undoubtedly attempt to steal as much as they
can before they collapse the economies of the world.
The attack on our
pensions
will intensify as we are presently witnessing in California.
The Federal Reserve will continue to buy distressed
properties through printing money out of thin air at the rate of $40 billion
per month.
However, the best predictor of the coming crash will
coincide with the globalists cornering the majority of the gold market
on this planet.
After the globalists gain control of the gold, then we
will witness a countdown to economic Armageddon in which all currencies
will hyper-inflate prior to collapsing.
Then humanity will be at the
mercy of people who no sense of decency and respect for life.
The financial markets are witnessing a massive artificially
contrived take-down of the prices of gold and silver to which the likes have
not been seen since In the past week, financial markets have witnessed the
largest 48 hour plunge in gold prices in over 30 years.
Goldman Sachs Just Opened the Gates to Hell
Silver
prices
have dropped dramatically this past Monday.
Panic
selling
dominated the market as investors and financial institutions could not dump
their holdings of silver and gold fast enough. The market clearly shows
signs of mass manipulation by the Globalists.
The best proof that the
globalists are manipulating the price
of gold comes from,
Goldman
Sachs
(who) reportedly told their clients earlier this month that they
recommend initiating a short COMEX gold position.
Please remember that,
-
this is the same Goldman Sachs that
shorted its stocks on 9/11
-
this is the same Goldman Sachs that placed put
options on Transocean stock the morning of the Gulf oil explosion
-
this is
the same Goldman Sachs that got caught shorting the housing market in
advance of the housing bubble burst
Basically, when Goldman Sachs starts
shorting anything, we should all become apprehensive particularly if our
individual investments are anywhere in the neighborhood of the commodities
being impacted by shorting.
When Goldman Sachs
begins to short anything, it
is time to take your money and run for the hills.
That time would be now.
Why Would Goldman Sachs Dramatically Drive the Price of Gold
Down?
Beside trading and bartering, if the dollar and the euro were
to collapse tomorrow, what currency of exchange would the left standing?
The
obvious and simple answer would be primarily, gold, and secondarily,
silver.
Ask yourself this question, if you knew that paper monies all around the
world were to collapse, what action would represent your best option? The
obvious answer would be to dramatically drive down the price of gold and
silver if one had the ability to do so, and then buy as much as gold as one
possibly could.
Goldman Sachs has the ability to do so by utilizing their
ominous shorting strategy
Everything Else Makes Sense
-
What will the people do when the proverbial poop hits the fan
and American citizens are unable to get their money out of the bank?
-
When
the pensions stop paying the retirees, what will many people do?
-
When the
401ks disappear in the last great bank robbery, what will people do?
In
simple terms, they will take to the streets.
When Americans seek some measure of revenge, what will they
do? It may not matter, because they will encounter a well-armed DHS equipped
with newly acquired 2.2 billion rounds of ammunition and backed up by 2700+
armored personnel carriers.
There will be a catastrophic carnage in the
streets of America and we are only weeks, at most, months away from this
happening.
These False Flag Events Dont Fly
Now, dont the
false flag events of,
...begin to make sense?
These events are all designed to lead to gun
confiscation so that
the globalists can continue to have their way with a
defenseless population. Also, these events provide good theater to provide a
distraction from the rampant theft of the American public.
In the upcoming
days and weeks, there will be more false flag events designed to justify the
seizing of our guns and to provide the pretext for martial law.
I am not Nostradamus, but I do have the globalists playbook
and I know that they are going for broke and soon the game will soon be over
if we are not willing to make a stand.
Conclusion
Is there any hope for humanity? Can Americans preserve what
is left of their financial future?
The only option is to go Iceland on the
Federal Reserve. Unless we are willing to force our government to arrest
the criminals from
the Federal Reserve and Goldman Sachs, we have no hope of
stemming the financial tide which will be used to enslave us.
Until America
develops a spine, the one thing you can still do at this present moment is
to remove your money, which you still can, from their criminal enterprise
banks.
