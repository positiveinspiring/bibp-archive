"The statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." Mark Twain (source)

On more than one occasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin has revealed information that Western media won't air.
Two months ago he provided information illustrating that ISIS is funded by the West (below video), and now he is making more noise at the G20 summit that's currently taking place in Turkey, where he has supposedly shared intelligence data on Islamic State financing with his G20 colleagues.
As RT News reports:
[During the summit] I provided examples based on our data on the financing of different Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) units by private individuals. This money, as we have established, comes from 40 countries and, there are some of the G20 members among them.

He also voiced his concern regarding the illegal oil trade by IS, stating that he has seen photos taken from space and from aircraft that demonstrate the scale of the illegal trade in oil and petroleum products.
I'd also like to mention that I am aware that RT news is sponsored by Russia, but the fact remains that Putin has said that Western nations are funding ISIS before.
Here is one of multiple examples.
At the summit he also stated that:
"The motorcade of refueling vehicles stretched for dozens of kilometers, so that from a height of 4,000 to 5,000 meters they stretch beyond the horizon."
Again, it's not the first time Putin has stressed that people who are going after ISIS and invading other countries (U.S. and their allies) are the very same people who funded and created ISIS in the first place.
His thoughts aren't as outlandish as you might first believe. If we take 9/11, for example, you may be surprised to learn that approximately half the population of the United States does not believe the official story provided to them by their government.
Many people think that 9/11 was an inside job, a 'false flag' terrorist attack in order to justify the infiltration of Iraq for ulterior motives, some poles even show that it's half the American population.
They believe this, not by blind faith, but because there is a tremendous amount of evidence that points in this direction.
The trend appears to continue with the recent attacks in Paris. A Canadian Economist and Professor Emeritus at the University of Ottawa recently called them "9/11 French Style."
He also recently stated that the global war on terrorism is based on fake premises, and that the Western world is going after a fictitious enemy, the Islamic state, when in fact the Islamic state is fully supported by the Western military alliance.
As you can see, Putin isn't alone in his thoughts, and even some celebrities have been trying to emphasize the same thing. Russell Brand is one, who touches on the topic on this video, and Steven Seagal is another, doing the same in this video.
That being said, when it comes to politics and the 'hidden hand' that controls this sphere, it is difficult to know what to believe, regardless of who is spreading the message.
For all we know, this could all be a part of one big, elaborate plan towards establishing a New World Order, but when it comes to matters where the truth seems so clear to many, like this issue of false flag terrorism, it's hard not to sit up and pay attention.
The world is waking up, and it's not easy to come to grips with the fact that the version of reality which is presented to you via your television might be completely false.
If the so-called 'terrorists' we are going after are nothing but the creation of the same countries who are attacking them,
What is really going on here? Why is it so hard to believe that Western media would be lying to us? Why do we instantly believe what a person is saying on the television, without ever questioning it? Why do we experience such a harsh resistance to the simple questioning of these matters?
