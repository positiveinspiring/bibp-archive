The next round of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
agreement negotiations will take place from December 3-12 in Auckland, New
Zealand, and it will be done with the
same level of secrecy as the last 14 rounds.
And like all of the previous rounds of talks, it
will take place in a luxury venue, only this time in a high-end casino, that
itself is
embroiled in its own controversy over corrupt dealings.
As TPP talks trudge along with ever more Pacific nations participating in
the meetings, our alarm over its intellectual property (IP) provisions has
only grown.
The IP language in this intricate trade
agreement would harm users digital rights in profound ways, such as
pressuring
ISPs to become Internet cops and criminalizing the distribution of
DRM-circumvention tools even for
fair uses.
It also attempts
to protect temporary copies, against the logic of how the Internet works.
The U.S. content industry has lobbied for this
language just as they did with the SOPA and PIPA bills early this year. In
doing so, they continue to demonstrate the same significant disregard for
consumers as they did when they cooked up harmful provisions within those
U.S. bills.
The TPP is one of
many venues that powerful content groups like the MPAA and RIAA use to
pressure governments into legally institutionalizing their unbalanced
control over culture, art, and information at the expense of the public. The
text remains under tight wraps and all we know about its contents come from
leaked drafts.
But public interest groups are continuing to
fight the secrecy. Several local and international organizations will be at
the negotiations putting on events for civil society groups and trade
delegates.
InternetNZ is putting on an music festival and
EFF, along with InternetNZ and
KEI, is hosting a Digital Rights
Camp for Asian-Pacific organizations.
More Countries to Join
the Upcoming Round
The number of countries involved with TPP continues to grow, and there is no
indication that its expansion will slow any time soon.
Last month,
Canada
and Mexico joined the
agreement and both will be represented at the next round in December.
However, they joined as second-tier negotiators, which means that they
will have to agree to sections negotiated over the previous 14 rounds of
talks without even seeing the text in advance.
As more nations join the talks, it is likely
that newcomers will be unable to alter or have a say over any of the
language that has already been drafted or agreed to by consensus by the
negotiating states.
There is notable resistance coming from within
Canada.
Civil society
groups,
experts, and legislators have already indicated strong opposition to the
existing drafted text (at least what they know about it from leaked versions
of the text). Canadian public interest organizations are especially
resistant to their joining the negotiations, in light of a recent copyright
reform bill that was negotiated after years of attempts to reform the
existing copyright law.
The new Canadian legislation struck a balance
between society and private interests, to reach pragmatic provisions that
acknowledge users rights. All of the language that was hard-fought for in
the law, Bill C-11,
would be thrown out the window if Canada were to sign on to TPP.
As it stands, the trade agreement contains much
more restrictive, pro-rightsholder language on copyright and enforcement.
EFF, the StopTheTrap coalition, and
Tamir Israel are putting a letter to
Canadian authorities urging them not to accept the U.S. proposals on
copyright and enforcement.
The next country to join TPP negotiations may be Thailand.
During Obama's
four-day visit to several Southeast Asian countries over the weekend, he
made a brief stop on Sunday and
announced that the U.S. "welcomed Thailand's interest in the TPP" at a joint
news conference with Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
Due to a
2007 amendment to the Thai Constitution, any treaty that has an immense
effect on the economic or social security of the country or results in the
binding of trade, requires National Assembly approval to enter talks, as
well as extensive public consultations following a treaty's conclusion.
Therefore it may take some time until Thailand
can officially join the negotiations.
This would mark the first time the two nations will participate in trade
talks together since the failure of a U.S.-Thailand free trade agreement (FTA)
under the Bush administration in 2006 amidst strong
domestic public opposition.
In 2007, the
Thai Human Rights
Commission published a harrowing report describing how all the ways it
would have endangered the rights and well-being of Thai people, and
Thai civil society groups
are now already resisting Thailand's entry into the TPP.
Given the lack of success in settling trade ties
with Thailand, however, and the
repeated appearance of Thailand on a yearly trade-sanction-threat list
called the Special 301 Watch List, getting them on board with the TPP
has likely been a high priority for the U.S.
With regard to Japan, the
news over when and if they will be joining TPP any time soon remains
speculative.
While some U.S. and Japanese business leaders
have repeatedly expressed its
desire for
Japan to enter the talks, domestic political complications make its
entry no easy task.
Still, despite strong opposition to the TPP by
various Japanese industry sectors, Prime Minister Noda
may use the agreement as an election issue in attempt to gain favoritism
among the business community and to distinguish himself from the
long-powerful opposition party that threatens to overtake him in Decembers
federal election.
U.S. Remains Committed
to Forging Ahead With TPP
While trade was not one the primary issues raised during the U.S. election
season, it is clear that the Obama administration
intends to forge ahead with TPP in the coming term.
Many argue that strengthening trade ties with
Pacific nations is part of a broader U.S. strategy to establish itself more
prominently to counteract Chinas growing economic influence in the region,
and to pressure them to
either join or adopt similar intellectual property reforms contained in
the TPP.
State representatives are
continuing to place pressure on the executive to increase transparency
in the negotiations and to uphold the public interest with the trade
agreement.
This week,
a group of state legislators met with Deputy U.S. Trade Representative (USTR)
Demetrios Marantis and Assistant USTR Barbara Weisel to reiterate their
worries that the TPP talks could constrain state government policies.
In light of
statements from the USTR earlier this fall, its clear that U.S. trade
representatives are taking notice of Congressional demands and concerns.
The
Obama administration will undoubtedly move
forward with these confidential, close-door meetings until they can
eventually conclude TPP, despite its many promises to paving a new road
towards transparent government. The content industry has been unfortunately
very effective in getting what they want from our public representatives,
and will continue to spend its resources to ensure that this complacency
continues.
As long as the public remains passively ignorant
of these efforts, these special interests will continue to whittle away at
users rights in more and more countries.
The way to fight back is to make our voice
heard:
to demand an open transparent process that allows everyone, from
experts to civil society members, to analyze, question, and probe any
initiatives to regulate the Internet.
The secrecy must be stopped.
