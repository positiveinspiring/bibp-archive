According to Naomi Wolfs
New York State Supreme Court complaint, she
first discovered "unexplained activity" on her three Washington Mutual
(WaMu)
checking accounts in 2005.
The prominent feminist author claims that she
diligently sought to "monitor the activity of her accounts." However, Wolf
was blocked in her own self-monitoring efforts when WaMu stopped sending her
monthly statements and denied her access to her online account.
The net result of WaMus alleged actions is that
Wolf alleges that more than $300,000 was stolen from her three accounts and
this resulted in her filing a law suit against the bank.
What happened to Naomi Wolf is going to be
played out all across this country. And we are not going to have long for
all of us to realize that we are Naomi Wolf.
What Used to Be
Unthinkable Is the New Norm
"...the game itself changed. By raiding the
depositors accounts, a major central bank has gone where they would not
previously have dared. The Rubicon has been crossed."
- Eric Sprott and Shree Kargutkar, "Caveat
Depositor"
America, we now live in a thugocracy.
The banksters are using the power of government
to steal from Americans. These banksters control the Congress, the President
and the judges. There is seemingly nobody who is beyond their sphere of
influence, as these criminals are the poster children for the old adage
which states that,
"Every man has his price".
This is the part of the article where the reader
would be advised to hang on every word that is written, because the
following will have a devastating effect on the financial well-being of
every American.
There is absolutely no integrity
in the banking system. There is no honor among these thieves. A
scientific, technocratic mafia runs the banking system. These money changing
criminals will keep enticing you to put your hard-earned money into their
privately run lairs of thievery.
Everyone reading these words will be victimized
in a manner similar to Naomi Wolf, if you keep the bulk of your funds in one
of
the Federal Reserve banks. Americans are woefully ignorant
regarding how much danger their deposits are truly in.
The thief is at the door and you are in danger
of having everything stolen.
Most Americans
Think That Their Deposits Are Safe
Some readers have written to me and have dutifully reminded me that
the FDIC is at their bank standing guard
over their deposits.
How woefully and depressingly ignorant is that
statement?
The FDIC does not have the money to cover your deposits, as it has only $25
billion in its deposit insurance fund. By law, the FDIC is required to keep
a balance equivalent to only 1.15% of insured deposits on hand. Yes,
America, that means that less than 2% of your deposits are covered.
Others have pointed out to me that the
Dodd-Frank Act (Section 716)
now bans taxpayer bailouts of most speculative derivatives
activities.
You remember
the derivatives dont you? They were the imaginary wealth that was built
upon more imaginary wealth but were guaranteed with hard assets backed by
the banks.
When this house of cards collapsed, it pulled the banks down and
led to the series of bailouts which has devastated our economy. Before
continuing in this analysis, we need to review one very important detail.
The derivative debt in this country is estimated at $1 quadrillion to $1.5
quadrillion dollars. This is more than 16 times the value of every asset on
the planet.
There is no way that this debt can ever be paid,
but that is not stopping the banks who are actively co-mingling their
derivative debt with their other banking instruments including their
customer savings deposits.
We could fund 1,000 bail outs and there is only
one unmistakable conclusion:
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT THIS DEBT
CAN EVER BE PAID OFF! - IT IS THE EXCUSE BEING USED, IN PERPETUITY,
FOR THE BANKSTERS TO KEEP STEALING FROM YOU!
Therefore, when your bank defaults, and it will,
the depositors as well as the banks will turn to the FDIC for relief.
The FDIC will have no choice but to draw upon
its credit line in order to cover a,
-
Bank of America
-
Wells Fargo
-
JPMorgan,
...derivatives bust, which has been co-mingled
with savings account funds.
The resulting effect is that this will require a
taxpayer bailout to cover the credit line. This will negate the safety from
the bailouts that the public thought that they were receiving under the
Dodd-Franks bill of no more bailouts.
What very few people are talking about, and as is the case with all credit
lines, this money will have to be paid back. Therefore, the coming default
of the FDIC, used to cover the derivatives debt, will become the excuse for
another taxpayer bailout. And on and on it goes.
When the last instrument has been looted and then deflated, where do you
think that will leave you and your computerized digits that represent the
bulk of your self-built financial empire?
All of your life, most of you have worked for
banker-backed interest in some capacity, and now these banksters are
stealing back the pittance they paid you in the first place.
Wheres Karl Marx when you need him?
Bank depositors of the world, unite!
Conclusion
America is only another 90 days away with another potential date with
destiny, another government default and shutdown.
Meanwhile, the banksters are the driving force
which forces us to the edge of financial destruction; and it is never going
to end until, we the people, have nothing left to steal. I am still highly
concerned about the cyber attack drill in the which the first of phases were
completed yesterday without any apparent incident.
As a reminder, the cyber attack drill consisted
of a simulated attack on
more than 1,000 banks participating in a
National Cyber-Attack Drill October 16-17 and again on October 23-24.
Phase two of this cyber drill will take place next week. As I have said
before, I do not make predictions and I am not predicting a false flag event
emanating from this event. However, given the nature of
past
false flag events (e.g. 9/11, 7/7 bombings and the Boston
Marathon bombing), the conditions are ripe that this could turn into another
false flag event.
I think if the government had not avoided total
default two days ago, the likelihood of this scenario turning into a false
flag event would have been more certain. It would be wise for us to keep our
eyes on October 23rd, but there is another major event that is rapidly
approaching and it will require our immediate attention.
Of course, you could take your money out of the bank. Well, maybe you can
Yesterday, Chase announced it is
limiting customer withdrawals.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
is suggesting that countries
tax the rich to fix deficit. This proposal
is a Trojan Horse. On the surface, this sounds like a wonderful idea. The
rich will not be taxed more, you will be.
This proposal will allow the banks to reach
further into your pocket. And the best thing of all for the banksters is
that no false flag attack is required in order to keep on stealing from us.
This will be the topic of
the next part in this series.
Move Your Money...
Out of The U.S. Banking System
- IT IS TIME -

I am often asked if it is time to leave the
United States because it has becoming too totalitarian.
My answer has been that it depends on the
individual and his circumstances, but I haven't given a blanket "Get out of
the United States" advisory.
I am still not prepared to give that warning, however, I am now advising
that your money be moved outside the US banking system. Within the last 24
hours, I have learned of two major banks that are making it difficult for
you to send international wires or draw out large amounts of cash.
Both
JPMorganChase and
HSBC USA have instituted new policies which
will make it difficult for you to withdraw your funds in certain ways.
This is not good. There are apparently some
workarounds relative to these policies, but just try setting up those
workarounds when you want to move your money during some kind of panic.
This is what you will face:
Bank line in California in
2008 at IndyMac Bank
Totalitarians don't take away all your freedoms
at once. They do it in incremental measures.
The prevention or delaying of certain
customers from sending international wires, and JPMorganChase stopping
some accounts from withdrawing large amounts of cash, is a serious
signal that we are well along the way to a banking sector that doesn't
respect its customers and has no compunctions about preventing customers
from pulling out their money, if the banks deem it in their interest to
prevent such withdrawals.
Bottom line:
You are playing with fire if you
keep any serious amount of money in a US bank.
It is time for serious diversification.
Depending upon the size of your assets,
there are different things that should be done. But almost everyone
should have some cash and gold coins stored outside the banking
system. Those with significant assets should begin international
diversification now, while it is still possible.
I don't consider any country completely
safe from the clutches of the US government, so international
diversification, among many countries, is also called for:
Switzerland and Hong Kong for starters,
...but also other countries that are not
known as tax havens, the USG has their claws into these countries. Be
creative...
