# The Technocracy's 1984 Predictive Programming

The technocratic, panopticon
Eye of
Big Brother watches you.
All the smart dummies,
upper class and yuppies
go along with and/or join the Outer
Party
thinking they'll win,
when the Inner Party hates them
more
than the proles.
As I have documented many times, the
coming technocracy is not something to come in the dark, distant
future, but a present reality.
Snowden's supposed "revelations"
were nothing more than rehashed information from years ago that
James Bamford included in all his books. Technology is actually
30 years ahead of what is released to the public, and this means
the coming AI dominated central system is presently in its
reconnaissance stage, gathering intel on the best human
opponents through the large online gaming communities.
Through
all the tracing and tracking, the supercomputers are storing the
data for future-predictive algorithmic war gaming.
The key issue to understand is
that the very computer system outlined in
Asimov's
Foundation is now a reality. In Foundation, Hari
Seldon figures out how to track mass movements over long periods
of time for future predictive programming.
While I do not
believe that a computer can become sentient, the
transhumanist
technocracy being erected is more interested in the
implementation of a techno slave grid that will massively
depopulate and reorganize society.
This is why the
computer games are so crucial:
from Halo to World of Warcraft to Black Ops, the information is
all being stored and analyzed for the purpose of creating a
system in which human error is unable to bring the system down.
The logic of this system is, in a
limited sense, highly logical:
past elites were unable to
maintain control due to human degeneration and mistakes.
The
thinking behind a technocracy is that AI (Artificial
Intelligence) programmed bots will
not err, and
the ruling structure will thus never fail.
The
large tech companies have all discussed this openly at large
conferences and in white papers, but the ignorant public marches
on, building the very system to enslave with their own money.
Money is a symbol of energy, and the erection of the mass
surveillance grid is not for the purpose of security or
preventing "terrorism." The purpose is that which is laid out
by science fiction writers, scientists and technocrats, and that
plan is massive depopulation and a reboot of society.
However,
in a deeper sense, it is not logical:
what is the reason, the
logos, of building a world system that is self-destructive?
The
only answer that is rational is evil.
Those that have bought
into this lie, believe the transhumanist falsehood that
immortality will be given through technological progress.
The
assumption of those who go along with this scheme is that they
will be given all the life extension and Elysium style
gifts of the gods to bring about a spacely Valhalla.
Agent Smith appears in a creepy GE ad for hospitals. This is a
dark, inside joke.
They didn't choose Neo - they chose Agent
Smith for the ad!
But there are several flaws with
this logic. First, there is no reason to believe that a system
that is fundamentally anti-human and anti-life will pay off the
dividends it promises. Those at the top of our system are
master con men villains.
Everyone knows from archetypal stories
from time immemorial the villain lies.
Villains are known
precisely for betraying those they recruit underneath them. It
should therefore be incumbent upon those in the system not to
trust their overlords, yet that is inevitably what men do.
What we will see is a future that is
literally what is shown in films like The Terminator
and its sequels. We will not see bots that look like Arnold
time travelling back to 2000 to kill John Connor:
we will see a
synchronization of all technology through the internet, with
Smart Houses, Smart Cities, Smart Cars, etc., all linked to
Smart Drones and Smart Bot Police, monitoring all things, and,
ultimately, bringing about a mass kill-off of 90% of the planet.
This hard truth is impossible for most people to accept because of the full spectrum weaponization of the entire environment.
From television to cell phones to tablets to
the internet to
vaccines to
the food and
water to the
pharmaceutical drugging to
chemtrail spraying to the
electromagnetic pollution from
cellular and ELF/VLF towers, the entire environment has been
converted into one, huge rat maze testing facility.
A "web" is used by a vicious
predator known as a spider.
The spider spins his web and links
all his environment into a vast array of patterns and
connections that all serve one purpose: to entrap prey and
parasitically feed off of them. That is precisely the goal of
the internet itself. It is amazing to see how gullible the mass
public is in regard to the reception and acceptance of the
Internet as if it were just deployed for everyone's benefit and
enjoyment.
Far from being the blessing Big Brother
Government
has sold it to be, the Internet is the key weapon system of
hardcore psychological warfare experts intent on converting the
world to a cashless slave grid.
Since the public has no
conception of "evil" as real, being a mass herd of relativists,
they cannot conceive of a caste of hardcore bankers and military
strategists that have nothing but pure hatred for them and long
to see them dead.
The masculinized feminist
carries
her Soviet hammer
to destroy the "tyrannical" patriarchy.
In fact, it was recently revealed
that in 1984 Apple ran an ad at the 1984 Superbowl that pictured
the public as the mindless proles of
Orwell's
1984.
Der Spiegel reports that new
NSA revelations about training slides
include images from the 1984 Apple ad
that portrays the football-watching public as zombie proles.
The ad is a huge
middle finger joke, but also reveals something deeper: the very
esoteric analyses I do are vindicated. Although readers are
very much on board with the overall presentation and
argumentation on my site, I still get a lot of resistance from
the so-called intelligentsia and acquaintances.
For many, the
analyses here are "fringe," "out there," "crazy," etc.
Yet here is a mainstream news
article illustrating the very thing I do - esoteric analysis.
The ad aired in 1984 on purpose, and referenced 1984 on purpose. Apple knew exactly what
they were doing, and
the NSA knows exactly what it's doing using this ad.
This
was an intentional form of psychological warfare to prepare the
public for the future - the very future enslavement that humans
would be conned into building.
And what I told you is now
revealed:
the big telecoms are the real NSA.
The "NSA" is a
cutout that receives the heat as a "government agency," while
the mega telecoms continue on, unaffected. The ad is all the
more ridiculous, as it presents an absurd feminist message of a
female track runner who destroys the patriarchal big brother,
Max Headroom looking image.
So a masculinized feminine nature
will destroy the evil patriarchy of masculine control? What a
joke - a symbolic message utterly divorced from reality.
The
New World Order's promotion of communism and feminism are key
military strategies in destroying the remnants of western, so-called
"culture" that are left. They have nothing to do with freedom. The woman throws a hammer at the image, smashing big brother
which hearkens to communism.
As if a MacIntosh computer +
communism/feminism are going to equal liberation.
Thus, the
whole ad is an inside joke, and the NSA's use of it further
demonstrates that fact.
Comment a year later
This past week, the world's
vultures,
the economic power elite, met in Davos to discuss the
maintenance of their global fiat hegemony.
Highlights included
furthering austerity, noting that the
serf class can't have air conditioning and cars, as well
as cheering on the
death of privacy through the rise of technocracy.
The
degenerate elite, completely out of touch with humanity,
resembles the controllers in the Lucas classic,
THX 1138,
building their own prison destined to entrap their own
progeny. Degenerate elite always end up being their own worst
enemy because pride detaches man from reality, which can only be
perceived in the truth.
Pride causes man to adopt a delusory
sense of the world and his own relation to it, thereby bringing
about a praxis divorced from the rules of nature, logic and
classical wisdom.
Banking man,
homo economicus, with
his foaming at the mouth rapaciousness, will find his own
descendants trapped in the virtual A.I. prison grid he has
built.
