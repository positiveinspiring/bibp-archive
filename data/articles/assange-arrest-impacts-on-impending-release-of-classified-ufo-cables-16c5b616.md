On Tuesday morning at 9:30 am,
Wikileaks founder
Julian Assange was placed under arrest and denied bail by British
authorities for allegations of rape being investigated in Sweden.
A new Swedish prosecutor had reopened an
investigation against Assange despite a previous prosecutor deciding against
pressing charges. One of the women involved in the case had after the
alleged rape incident thrown a party for Assanges benefit.
That and other
actions by the women involved persuaded the original prosecutor not to
charge Assange.
One of the women has been found to
have
connections to the CIA suggesting Assange may have been set up in a honey
trap operation.
The arrest and detention of Assange creates confusion over
how and when future diplomatic cables will be released. Of special interest,
are those concerning UFOs.
Wikileaks had come increasingly under pressure from the U.S. government and
major allies such as Australia, Sweden and France to prosecute Julian
Assange, and/or curtail internet servers hosting leaked classified U.S.
diplomatic cables.
Amazon.Com, Paypal, and the internet service
EveryDNS.net all quickly jettisoned their connections to Wikileaks after
pressure from U.S. authorities.
All this has occurred despite the fact that many
believe the documents released so far are pretty innocuous and amount to
little more than diplomatic chatter. Some Wikileaks critics had gone so far
as to claim that Assange is actually
aiding and abetting a major U.S. ally,
Israel, by selectively releasing documents.
Others viewed the Wikileaks release as part of a
false flag operation to justify internet censorship. The most recent
response by U.S. authorities to request diplomatic and military personnel
NOT to read the Wikileaks material is deemed by some to be a panicked
over-reaction that may in the end only help Wikileaks grow in popularity.
If the diplomatic cables released so far are
innocuous, helping a major U.S. ally or a false flag operation, as some
claim, why the panicked response by U.S. authorities? The answer may lie in
a brief response Assange gave to a question in a Guardian newspaper
interview. Assange said that some of the diplomatic cables soon to be
released contain references to UFOs.
In response to a question about whether any of the documents sent to
Wikileaks discussed UFOs and extraterrestrial life, Assange
began his
response by dismissing the relevance of much of what he had received:
Many weirdos email us about UFOs or how they
discovered that they were the anti-christ whilst talking with their
ex-wife at a garden party over a pot-plant. However, as yet they have
not satisfied two of our publishing rules.
-
that the documents not be self-authored
-
that they be original.
Just as it appeared that Wikileaks had no
credible documents about UFOs, Assange made a
bombshell admission:
However, it is worth noting that in
yet-to-be-published parts of the cablegate archive there are indeed
references to UFOs.
Assange did not elaborate on the context of the
UFO related documents, nor did he give a time table for their release.
According to a number of confidential insider sources known to
alternative science researcher, there has been a furious behind-the-scenes
struggle over the pace and extent of UFO disclosure.
He
claims that Wikileaks is likely to release enough information about UFOs to bring a
rapid end to the decades-long secrecy surrounding extraterrestrial life and
technology.
This is very, very interesting. Disclosure is happening now. It hasnt
gotten into UFOs just yet, but were already seeing the signs of what true
Disclosure will be like - an explosive burst of new information that the
insiders do not want you to know, all coming out at once.
If he is correct, Wikileaks is poised to transform the world as we know
it.
That would explain the panicked reaction to the Wikileaks releases by
U.S. authorities, and may even be related to the apparent honey trap
operation that has resulted in Assanges arrest.
Prominent figures on the right wing of U.S. politics such as
Mike Huckabee,
Sarah Palin and
Rush Limbaugh have gone as far as calling for Assange to be
hunted down, tried and executed for the damage he has caused to U.S.
national interests.
The FOX news network is most prominent in
advocating a draconian line to be taken against Assange and Wikileaks. What
is not well understood is that FOX news has been instrumental in creating a
debilitating partisan political environment that has hamstrung the Obama
administration in its policy initiatives.
FOX news represents the interests of prominent
political and industrial figures that have long been associated with the
cover-up of UFOs and extraterrestrial life.
At the other end of the political spectrum, the
Secretary of State,
Hillary Clinton has tried to make
lemonade out of the Wikileaks lemon by focusing on what it reveals about the
professionalism of U.S. diplomacy.
In a recent dinner she
praised the,
"full breadth and depth of American artistry
and diversity," adding in jest, "I am writing a cable about it, which
I'm sure you'll find soon on your closest website."
What Clinton is not revealing is her own past
role in endorsing the release of UFO files as First Lady during the Clinton
administration.
Hillary, along with President Clinton, met with
Laurence Rockefeller in 1995 in Wyoming. The Clintons were given an informal
briefing about why it was in U.S. national interests to disclose information
about UFOs and extraterrestrial life.
Clinton accompanied by
Laurence Rockefeller
in August 1995 in Wyoming
FOIA documents confirm that Hillary then became
Rockefellers point person in encouraging the Clinton administration to move
forward with such a release.
Political contingencies led to the Clintons
eventually failing in their efforts to have UFO files released. Similarly,
the Obama administration has failed to make much headway in behind the
scenes efforts to release UFO documents partly due to the highly partisan
political environment created by the FOX news network.
Hillary Clinton is very aware of the contents of diplomatic cables yet to be
released. If some concern UFOs, they may well be the catalyst for the
collapse of secrecy surrounding the truth behind UFOs and extraterrestrial
life. That may help explain why Clinton is more muted in what punitive
action should be taken against Assange.
Clinton, along with others in the Obama
administration, privately welcome the release of documents that bring to an
end the secrecy surrounding UFOs. However, the prominence and influence of
many right wing commentators associated with the FOX news network, the Obama
administration has to be seen to be taking action to put a stop to Wikileaks.
Hence the dubious legal effort to investigate
bringing criminal charges against Assange, and attempt to
prevent diplomatic
personnel reading online the classified documents released by Wikileaks.
The official U.S. response to the Wikileaks
release is not well thought out and is predicted to very likely
increase
public interest and support for the Wikileaks material. The U.S. response
very likely reflects conflicting reactions of panic and elation among senior
policy makers over a possible catastrophic collapse in the secrecy system
surrounding UFOs.
Assanges arrest in Britain creates uncertainty over when and how future
diplomatic cables will be released.
The denial of bail to Assange on flimsy legal
grounds is likely to be used as a lever by authorities behind the scenes to
prevent or slow the release of some of the more damaging diplomatic
information. The result however may be the so called nuclear option Assange has threatened where all the diplomatic cables will be released at
once without any redactions or filtering.
Despite Assanges arrest, Wikileaks continues to
function and
today tweeted that the gradual release will continue. So
whether the nuclear option happens or classified information continues to
come out gradually, the eventual release of diplomatic cables concerning
UFOs may lead to a collapse of the secrecy system surrounding UFOs and
extraterrestrial life.
That will change the world as we know it.
