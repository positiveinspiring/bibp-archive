Unsuspecting citizens
are paying for a nexus of interlocking agencies
that conspire to create terror, war, and police-state legislation
in a War of Deception that serves to devastate humanity.
Without its arsenal of fabricated war pretexts,
and its fabricated Fear apparatus,
the warmongering oligarchy
would be denuded and reveal itself
as the mass-murdering terrorist entity that it is.
Most recently, in Canada, Justice Catherine Bruce disclosed the true nature of an RCMP terror plot when she overturned terror convictions against two patsies - John Nuttal and Amanda Korody - who were set up by police operatives to commit a terrorist act for which they would otherwise be totally incapable of performing.
Bruce stated the obvious when she observed that,
Simply put, the world has enough terrorists. We do not need the police to create more out of marginalized people who have neither the capacity nor sufficient motivation to do it themselves.
The "forbidden truth" is that agencies of Canada's federal government created a false flag terror event with a view to:
create an atmosphere of fear (aimed at the general public as well as politicians), create Islamophobia create a false pretext for a War on Terror (translated: illegal imperial invasions using un-Islamic terrorists as proxy armies) create a pretext for unconstitutional, fascist, police state legislation (C-51 legislation)

Unsuspecting, otherwise peace-loving citizens, are also being duped into paying for Private Intelligence Contractors (PICS) who receive lucrative government contracts to engage in a full spectrum of activities designed to create and sustain war crimes.
The author writes in "Full Spectrum Dominance" - Private Intelligence Contractors and "Engineered Consent" that,
Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) is likely the largest (and least known) PIC, with a huge staff (about 40,000 in 2007, likely more now), and it is fully integrated into the War Machine. Donald L. Bartlett and James B. Steele report in "Washington's $8 Billion Shadow," that, 'SAIC's friends in Washington are everywhere, and play on all sides; the connections are tightly interlocked. To cite just one example: Robert M. Gates, the new secretary of defense, whose confirmation hearings lasted all of a day, is a former member of SAIC's board of directors '

The U.S. government, through its incestuous relationship with SAIC, effectively created false intelligence - with impunity - as a fabricated pretext to wage the illegal war of aggression against Iraq.
Fake intelligence reports were also used to pin the East Ghouta (false flag) terror event on the Assad government, and to provoke a direct U.S./Coalition military invasion to depose Syria's democratically-elected President.
A memo from "Veterans intelligence Professionals for Sanity" (VIPS) indicated that,
some of our former co-workers are telling us, categorically, that contrary to the claims of your administration, the most reliable intelligence shows that Bashar al-Assad was NOT responsible for the chemical incident that killed and injured Syrian civilians on August 21, and that British intelligence officials also know this. In writing this brief report, we choose to assume that you have not been fully informed because your advisers decided to afford you the opportunity for what is commonly known as 'plausible denial.'

The CIA specializes in the commission of crimes beneath which the protective shield of "plausible deniability" can be invoked should suspicions of CIA complicity be aroused.
Professor Tim Anderson and others also demonstrate, with sustainable evidence, that the East Ghouta gas attack was false flag terrorism.
The Pentagon's use of PICS to perpetrate war crimes is now becoming normalized.
According to Kate Brannen in "Spies-for-Hire Now at War in Syria", the Pentagon publicly disclosed the terms of a contract with a PIC called Six3 Intelligence Solutions (acquisition on 2013 by CACI) to provide "intelligence analysis services" in a number of countries, but most notably, Syria.
The public may not be aware that,
such an intervention in Syria is illegal or that Six3 Intelligence Solutions has a proven track record as interrogators at the Abu Ghraib torture chambers or that it will no doubt offer the CIA plenty of "plausible deniability" to perpetrate crimes with impunity

Whereas the government and its agencies should be using our tax dollars to "create no harm", and to further the cause of peace and prosperity, it is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that governing agencies are creating much harm, through stealth and deception, thanks to the steady flow of tax dollars streaming into its coffers...
Return to 'War on Terror'
Return to American "Empire"
Return to The Actual Syrian Case
Return to CIA - The Central Intelligence Agency
