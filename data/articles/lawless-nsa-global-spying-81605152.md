NSA is one of 16 known US spy agencies. Perhaps
others operate secretly.
Black budgets conceal what's spent. Amounts are
enormous. They're unconscionable.
Used responsibly, they'd relieve hunger, shelter
the homeless, heal the sick, and educate young people hungry for knowledge. Out-of-control, unregulated, unmonitored
practices operate lawlessly. Enormous harm results.
Rogue states operate
that way.

It called NSA:
"a separately organized agency
within the Department of Defense under the direction, authority, and control
of the Secretary of Defense for the performance of highly specialized
technical functions in support of the intelligence activities of the United
States."
It's headquartered at Fort Meade, MD. It's
operations are highly classified. General Keith Alexander heads them. Spies
"R" Us, defines them.
On December 4, 1981,
Executive Order 12333, explained NSA/Central Security Service (CSS)
responsibilities and purposes.
Head of operations is charged with:
-
"Collect(ing, including through
clandestine means), process, analyze, produce, and disseminate
signals intelligence information and data for foreign intelligence
and counterintelligence purposes to support national and
departmental missions;
-
Acting(ing) as the National Manager for
National Security Systems as established in law and policy, and in
this capacity be responsible to the Secretary of Defense and to the
Director, National Intelligence; (and)
-
Prescrib(ing) security
regulations covering operating practices, including the
transmission, handling, and distribution of signals intelligence and
communications security material within and among the elements under
control of the Director of the National Security Agency, and
exercise the necessary supervisory control to ensure compliance with
the regulations."
On July 31, 2008,
EO 12333 was amended to:
By law,
NSA's mission is
limited to monitoring, collecting and analyzing foreign communications.
Its
dual missions include:
Rule of law principles are systematically
spurned. It's more true now than ever. It's far worse than most people
imagine. Anything goes reflects policy. NSA's a power unto itself. It does
whatever it wants covertly.
It spies globally.
Big Brother is real. NSA
reflects it writ large. Virtually everyone can be watched everywhere all the
time. It's done with technological ease. No one's safe anywhere any time.
There's no place to hide.
NSA calls its mission,
"cryptology that encompasses
both Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Information Assurance (IA)
products and services, and enables Computer Network Operations (CNO) in
order to gain a decision advantage for the Nation and our allies under
all circumstances."
Spies "R" Us explains it better.
Telecom, Internet and thousands of other
corporations cooperate. They're complicit as willing partners. They're
involved extrajudicially. They operate secretly. They're unapologetic.
In the 1950s and 60s, NSA spied on all US
incoming and outgoing telegrams. In the 1970s, an
independent Church
Committee investigation discovered clandestine operations for the first
time.
Change was demanded. Lawless spying is
intolerable. Decades earlier practices pale compared to what now goes on.
Subverting fundamental law constitutes tyranny. Today it exists writ large.
America never was democratic. It's not now. It's
secretive, ruthless, and unprincipled. It's hegemonically out-of-control
abroad.
It's domestic policies reflect police state
lawlessness. Fundamental international, constitutional and US statute laws
don't matter. Diktat power rules. Presidents, Congress and federal courts
are complicit.
According to Representative Loretta Sanchez (D.
CA), what's been publicly revealed reflects "the tip of the iceberg." She
was "astounded" about information disclosed privately.
She "can't speak to what" she now knows. It's
vital others explain what everyone has a right to know. Sunshine is our
first line of defense. Constructive change depends on how it's used.
NSA does more than spy. It lawlessly hacks
computer and telecommunication networks. It does so globally. It focuses
heavily on strategically important countries.
Mathhew Aid is a US
intelligence expert. On June 10, his Foreign Policy Article headlined "Inside the NSA's Ultra-Secret China
Hacking Group."
It "actively engage(s) in cyber-espionage." It
does so covertly and lawlessly. Rogue states operate that way. America's by
far the worst.
Obama officials point fingers the wrong way.
They accuse China of active cyber-espionage against America. Beijing hit
back publicly. Senior Chinese officials accused Washington of hypocrisy.
Beijing's top Internet official, Huang Chengquing, said China has
"mountains of data" revealing widespread US
hacking. It's designed to steal government secrets.
According to Aid, NSA's Office of Tailored
Access Operations (TAO),
"successfully penetrated Chinese computer
and telecommunications systems for almost 15 years, generating some of
the best and most reliable intelligence information about what is going
on inside the People's Republic of China."
Most NSA employees and officials know little or
nothing about TAO. "(E)xtraordinary sensitivity" of its operations
keeps them secret. Only those needing to know have full access.
Special security clearances are required,
"to gain access to the unit's work spaces
inside the NSA operations complex," said Aid.
"The door leading to its
ultramodern operations center is protected by armed guards, an imposing
steel door that can only be entered by entering the correct six-digit
code into a keypad, and a retinal scanner to ensure that only those
individuals specially cleared for access get through the door."
TAO's mission involves,
"collect(ing) intelligence
information on foreign targets by surreptitiously hacking into their
computers and telecommunications systems, cracking passwords,
compromising the computer security systems protecting the targeted
computer, stealing the data stored on computer hard drives, and then
copying all the messages and data traffic passing within the targeted
email and text-messaging systems."
"The technical term of art used by NSA to
describe these operations is computer network exploitation (CNE)."
Last October, Obama authorized selecting
overseas targets for cyber-attacks. He did so by
secret presidential directive. He's playing with fire.
His Offensive Cyber Effects Operations (OCEO)
claims to,
"offer unique and
unconventional capabilities to advance US national objectives around the
world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with
potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging."
Washington will,
"identify potential targets of national
importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and
risk as compared with other instruments of national power."
It suggests operating domestically the same way.
Keith Alexander heads US Cyber Command (Cybercom).
He's authorized to conduct these attacks. TAO personnel are responsible for developing
information needed to destroy, damage, or otherwise compromise targeted
sites.
According to Aid, TAO,
"is the now the largest and arguably the
most important component of the NSA's huge Signal Intelligence (SIGINT)
Directorate."
"(O)ver 1,000 military and
civilian computer hackers, intelligence analysts, targeting specialists,
computer hardware and software designers, and electrical engineers."
Their job is identifying computer systems and
supporting telecommunications networks for attack.
TAO is "an industry unto itself." It's a virtual
"wunderkind" of US intelligence.
"They go places, get things
(and do what) nobody else in the IC (intelligence community) can."
It keeps growing in size and scope. It's a
global monster. It's exponentially expanding. It's so huge and menacing it's
no longer possible to hide.
China's acutely aware of its activities.
President Xi Jinping knows the threat. So do Russia, Iran, and leaders of
other countries.
They're reacting defensively and offensively.
Two sides can play this game. Cyber-attacks constitute war by other means.
Fallout can be disastrous. America's an out-of-control menace. It's
lawless, unprincipled, uncompromising, and unrelenting. It threatens freedom
and world peace.
According to
Wired.com, a recent Pentagon report recommended nuclear war in response
to cyberattacking America.
Former New York Times executive editor Bill
Keller now write Times op-eds. He does so irresponsibly. He supports Big
Brother lawlessness. Perhaps he has something to hide. He's been on the
wrong side of issues for years. He disgraces his profession doing so.
On June 16, he headlined "Living
with the Surveillance State." Spying is good, he suggests. Sacrificing
privacy and other freedoms are small prices to pay. Preventing terror attacks matter most. No
threats exist. Claiming otherwise doesn't wash.
Keller didn't explain.
"The danger," he says, "is not surveillance
per se." He claims most people "decided that life on the grid entails a
certain amount of intrusion."
He arrogantly believes "most people" share his
view.
We're "adjusting to life in a surveillance state," he says.
Big Brother writ large reflects police state
lawlessness. No one understanding the stakes is comfortable.
Real danger, says Keller, exists without,
"rigorous, independent
regulation and vigilant oversight to keep potential abuses of power from
becoming a real menace to our freedom."
He's more out of touch than he admits.
Democracy's more illusion than reality.
So-called checks and balances. They eroded long ago. They're nonexistent.
Diktat power runs America. Congress and federal
courts are complicit. Tyranny's the law of the land. Police state statutes
eroded most freedoms. Anyone can be targeted for any reason or none at all.
Thousands of political prisoners rot in
America's gulag. It's the world's largest by far. Permanent war is
longstanding policy. So is torture, neoliberal harshness, out-of-control
corruption, and whatever monied interests say goes.
America's social contract is being destroyed.
It's happening in plain sight. Thirdworldizing America is policy. A race to
the bottom reflects it. Reality for most people is nightmarish. Today's
young generation has no future.
Inequality is institutionalized. Wealth, power
and privilege alone matter. Popular needs go begging. Mass surveillance
reflects what Chomsky calls "keeping the rabble in line."
Media scoundrels like Keller don't explain.
"I don't think we're on a slippery slope to
a police state," he claims.
Perhaps he didn't notice one already exists.
Times columnist Tom Friedman's no better. His
articles reflect hack journalism. He's unprincipled and wrongheaded. He
supported
Bush's Iraq war. He's unconcerned about imperial aggression. He
suggests America's "designated enemies" border on insanity. He's silent
on
Israel's worst crimes. He supports Big Brother lawlessness.
He did so in his article
headlined "Blowing
a Whistle."
"Yes, I worry about potential
government abuse of privacy from a program designed to prevent another
9/11 - abuse that, so far, does not appear to have happened. But I worry
about another 9/11."
Fact check
Gross privacy abuses exist.
Free expression is
compromised. Dissent is an endangered species.
9/11 is the Big Lie of our
time. It was state-sponsored terrorism. It was
a false flag. Overwhelming
evidence proves it.
Friedman claims America's an
"open society."
He's paid to lie. He and other media scoundrels substitute managed news
misinformation for truth and full disclosure.
Snowden's no "heroic whistle-blower," he says.
Big Brother's protecting us, he believes.
Sacrificing freedom for alleged
security's worth it, he claims. He's unaware of any abuses. He's more out of touch than Keller. America's
freedom rests in peace. It lies in history's dustbin. Police state
lawlessness replaced it.
Blowing that whistle matters most.
