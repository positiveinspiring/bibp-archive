Israels plan to attack Iran has been postponed until spring 2013 following
a war simulation that showed Iran could kill 200 Americans with a single
missile strike, according to a report by senior Haaretz correspondent
Amir Oren.
At 8:58 P.M. on Tuesday, Israels 2012 war
against Iran came to a quiet end. The capricious plans for a huge aerial
attack were returned to the deep recesses of safes and hearts.
The war may not have been canceled but it
has certainly been postponed. For a while, at least, we can sound the
all clear: It wont happen this year. Until further notice, Israel Air
Force Flight 007 will not be taking off,
writes Oren.
According to the report, a war simulation
conducted by the U.S. Central Command found that an Israeli attack on Irans
nuclear facilities would immediately be followed by an Iranian missile
launch that would kill 200 Americans, a price deemed not worth paying by
U.S. generals.
During the same meeting, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak also
acknowledged that Israel would not act alone in striking Iran before the
U.S. presidential elections in November, according to Oren, meaning that,
For all intents and purposes, it was an
announcement that this war was being postponed until at least the spring
of 2013.
A delay in launching the attack until next
spring would scupper expectations that the military assault was set to take
place before the end of this year, a time frame that Russia understood
the Israelis were working to.
Last month, Chief of the General Staff of the
Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Makarov
stated that an Israeli decision on whether
or not to attack would be made before the summer.
In January, the U.S.
cancelled a joint military exercise with
Israel which was perceived by many as a sign that the Americans were getting
cold feet.
Earlier this month it was
also reported that Israel had,
agreed to hold off a strike on Irans
nuclear sites this year in exchange for receiving U.S. military
equipment, including bunker-busting bombs and refueling planes.
The deal was seen as a tacit admission that
the
Obama administration would support Israel in launching the
attack but only after the election in November.
If a decision has been made to postpone the attack, expect the United States
to withdraw at least some of its naval might from the Persian Gulf. The U.S.
currently has the USS Carl Vinson and the USS Abraham aircraft carriers
patrolling the Strait of Hormuz, along with the USS Makin Island, a
Wasp-class amphibious assault ship.
Earlier this month
it was announced that four additional mine
countermeasure ships were also heading for the region.
As the Stratfor Naval Update map below illustrates, the USS Enterprise,
which many speculated was also heading to the Strait of Hormuz in
preparation for a strike on Iran, is now scheduled to visit Piraeus, Greece
instead, suggesting a cooling of tensions could be taking place - at
least for the time being...
