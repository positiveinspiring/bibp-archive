Media Blackout of New Syria
Revelations
On April 6, The London Review of Books
published in its online journal Seymour Hersh's "The
Red Line and the Rat Line."
Hersh continues to expose details
surrounding the staged August 21 chemical attack incident in Syria,
which apparently pretty much everyone in Washington's
intelligence bureaucracy suspected was carried out by the rebels as soon
as it happened.
Seymour Hersh is a Pulitzer Prize winning
journalist whose 40+ years career includes the exposing of the
My Lai Massacre and its
cover-up, as well as the
Abu Ghraib prison scandal.
His December 19 report,
"Whose
Sarin?", was his first report to
expose the Syria chemical attack hoax based on close
contact with US Intelligence officials.
While "Whose Sarin" was originally
prepared for the Washington Post, the
newspaper rejected it and a
media blackout followed in American press. Currently, Hersh's newest
investigative findings are going unacknowledged in mainstream US media.
Hersh's report confirms the following:
-
Obama's push for attack on Syria was
halted last minute when evidence that the Syrian government had
nothing to do with the August 21 chemical attack became too
overwhelming
-
It had been well known to US
government officials throughout the summer of 2013 that Turkish
PM Erdogan was supporting al-Nusra Front in attempts to
manufacture Sarin
-
US military knew of Turkish and
Saudi program for bulk Sarin production inside Syria from the
spring of 2013
-
UN inspectors knew the rebels were
using chemical weapons on the battlefield since the spring of
2013
-
As a result of the staged chemical
incident, the White House ordered readiness for a "monster
strike" on Syria, which included "two B-22 air wings and two
thousand pound bombs" -and a target list which included military
and civilian infrastructure targets (note: most of these are in
densely populated civilian areas)
-
Full military strike was set for
September 2
-
UK defense officials relayed to
their American counterparts in the lead up to planned attack:
"We're being set up here."
-
CIA, MI6, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and
Turkey set up a "rat line" back in 2012 to run Libyan weapons
into Syria via Turkey, including MANPADS; the Benghazi consulate
was headquarters for the operation
-
Obama OK'ed Turkish-Iranian gold
export scam (that went from March 2012 to July 2013) which
erupted in a Turkish scandal that nearly brought down the
Erdogan government
-
US Intelligence community had
immediate doubts about Syrian regime responsibility for Aug. 21
attack, yet "reluctant to contradict the president"
-
US government will not expose
continued Turkey support of terrorism simply because "they're a
NATO ally"
In addition, last Thursday freelance
Middle East journalist Sara Elizabeth Williams broke the story of
a CIA/US Military run training camp for Syrian rebels in the Jordanian
desert.
VICE UK ran her story,
"I
Learned to Fight Like an American at the FSA Training Camp in Jordan,"
yet it too failed to make it across the Atlantic into American
reporting.
International Syria experts thought her
story hugely significant, but it got little attention.
Top Syria expert in the US, Joshua Landis,
announced on his Twitter account Thursday:
"Sara Williams gets the scoop on the top
secret FSA Training Camp in Jordan."
This courageous young freelancer revealed,
with
photos, the ins and outs of this
secretive facility - yet
the mainstream carefully shielded
Americans from knowledge of the explosive report.
In email conversation with her this weekend,
Williams told me:
"The access was tough to get, but I
think it was worth the effort: to my mind, it's important that
people know what their government is doing in their name, with their
tax dollars."
According to her
investigative report:
-
Confirmed: "US-run training camp"
for Syrian rebels in Northern Jordan
-
Rebel recruits go "off the grid"
while in secretive training camp
-
Rebel fighter: "The Americans who
taught us wore military uniforms I did not recognize. We called
them by their first names and they spoke English to us."
-
Camp awash with "American food and
American dollars": recruits eat Kentucky Fried Chicken and live
in temporary "pre-fabricated housing" units
-
Recruits sent through intense 40 day
program, which includes exercise, training in anti-tank
missiles, and boot camp style atmosphere with orders given by US
military instructors
-
Upon graduation, US trained
insurgents slip back across Syria's southern border
-
Experts say there are more camps
like this one
-
American trained rebel insurgent
says: "America is benefiting from the destruction and the
killing in order to weaken both sides."
