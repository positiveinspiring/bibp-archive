Massive attention has now been given - and rightly so - to the reasons
why Britain went to war against Iraq. But far too little attention has
focused on why the US went to war, and that throws light on British motives
too. The conventional explanation is that after the Twin Towers were hit,
retaliation against al-Qaida bases in Afghanistan was a natural first step
in launching a global war against terrorism.
Then, because Saddam Hussein was alleged by the
US and UK governments to retain weapons of mass destruction, the war could
be extended to Iraq as well. However this theory does not fit all the facts.
The truth may be a great deal murkier.
We now know that a blueprint for the creation of a global Pax Americana was
drawn up for Dick Cheney (now vice-president), Donald Rumsfeld (defense
secretary), Paul Wolfowitz (Rumsfeld's deputy), Jeb Bush (George Bush's
younger brother) and Lewis Libby (Cheney's chief of staff).
The document,
entitled
Rebuilding America's Defenses, was written in September 2000 by the
neoconservative think tank, Project for the New American Century (PNAC).
The plan shows Bush's cabinet intended to take military control of the Gulf
region whether or not Saddam Hussein was in power.
It says,
"while the
unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need
for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue
of the regime of Saddam Hussein."
The PNAC blueprint supports an earlier document attributed to Wolfowitz and
Libby which said the US must,
"discourage advanced industrial nations from
challenging our leadership or even aspiring to a larger regional or
global role".
It refers to key allies such as the UK as "the
most effective and efficient means of exercising American global
leadership". It describes peacekeeping missions as "demanding American
political leadership rather than that of the UN".
It says,
"even should Saddam pass from the scene", US
bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will remain permanently... as "Iran may
well prove as large a threat to US interests as Iraq has".
It spotlights China for "regime change", saying
"it is time to increase the presence of American forces in SE Asia".
The document also calls for the creation of "US space forces" to dominate
space, and the total control of cyberspace to prevent "enemies" using the
Internet against the US. It also hints that the US may consider developing
biological weapons,
"that can target specific genotypes [and] may transform
biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool".
Finally - written a year before 9/11 - it pinpoints North Korea, Syria and
Iran as dangerous regimes, and says their existence justifies the creation
of a "worldwide command and control system". This is a blueprint for US
world domination. But before it is dismissed as an agenda for rightwing
fantasists, it is clear it provides a much better explanation of what
actually happened before, during and after 9/11 than the global war on
terrorism thesis.
This can be seen in several ways.
First, it is clear the US authorities did little or nothing to pre-empt
the
events of 9/11. It is known that at least 11 countries provided advance
warning to the US of the 9/11 attacks. Two senior Mossad experts were sent
to Washington in August 2001 to alert the CIA and FBI to a cell of 200
terrorists said to be preparing a big operation (Daily Telegraph, September
16 2001). The list they provided included the names of four of the 9/11
hijackers, none of whom was arrested.
It had been known as early as 1996 that there were plans to hit Washington
targets with airplanes. Then in 1999 a US national intelligence council
report noted that,
"al-Qaida suicide bombers could crash-land
an aircraft packed with high explosives into the Pentagon, the
headquarters of the CIA, or the White House".
Fifteen of the 9/11 hijackers obtained their
visas in Saudi Arabia. Michael Springman, the former head of the American
visa bureau in Jeddah, has stated that since 1987 the CIA had been illicitly
issuing visas to unqualified applicants from the Middle East and bringing
them to the US for training in terrorism for the Afghan war in collaboration
with Bin Laden (BBC, November 6 2001). It seems this operation continued
after the Afghan war for other purposes.
It is also reported that five of the hijackers
received training at secure US military installations in the 1990s
(Newsweek, September 15 2001).
Instructive leads prior to 9/11 were not followed up. French Moroccan flight
student Zacarias Moussaoui (now thought to be the 20th hijacker) was
arrested in August 2001 after an instructor reported he showed a suspicious
interest in learning how to steer large airliners. When US agents learned
from French intelligence he had radical Islamist ties, they sought a warrant
to search his computer, which contained clues to the September 11 mission
(Times, November 3 2001). But they were turned down by the FBI.
One agent wrote, a month before 9/11, that
Moussaoui might be planning to crash into the Twin Towers (Newsweek, May 20
2002).
All of this makes it all the more astonishing - on the war on terrorism
perspective - that there was such slow reaction on September 11 itself. The
first hijacking was suspected at not later than 8.20am, and the last
hijacked aircraft crashed in Pennsylvania at 10.06am. Not a single fighter
plane was scrambled to investigate from the US Andrews airforce base, just
10 miles from Washington DC, until after the third plane had hit the
Pentagon at 9.38 am.
Why not?
There were standard FAA intercept procedures for
hijacked aircraft before 9/11. Between September 2000 and June 2001 the US
military launched fighter aircraft on 67 occasions to chase suspicious
aircraft (AP, August 13 2002). It is a US legal requirement that once an
aircraft has moved significantly off its flight plan, fighter planes are
sent up to investigate.
-
Was this inaction simply the result of key people disregarding, or being
ignorant of, the evidence?
-
Or could US air security operations have been
deliberately stood down on September 11?
-
If so, why, and on whose authority?
The former US federal crimes prosecutor, John Loftus, has said:
"The
information provided by European intelligence services prior to 9/11 was so
extensive that it is no longer possible for either the CIA or FBI to assert
a defense of incompetence."
Nor is the US response after 9/11 any better. No serious attempt has ever
been made to catch
Bin Laden. In late September and early October 2001,
leaders of Pakistan's two Islamist parties negotiated Bin Laden's
extradition to Pakistan to stand trial for 9/11.
However, a US official said, significantly,
that,
"casting our objectives too narrowly" risked
"a premature collapse of the international effort if by some lucky
chance Mr Bin Laden was captured".
The US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,
General Myers, went so far as to say that "the goal has never been to get
Bin Laden" (AP, April 5 2002).
The whistleblowing FBI agent Robert Wright
told ABC News (December 19 2002) that FBI headquarters wanted no arrests.
And in November 2001 the US airforce complained it had had al-Qaida and
Taliban leaders in its sights as many as 10 times over the previous six
weeks, but had been unable to attack because they did not receive permission
quickly enough (Time Magazine, May 13 2002).
None of this assembled evidence, all of which
comes from sources already in the public domain, is compatible with the idea
of a real, determined war on terrorism.
The catalogue of evidence does, however, fall into place when set against
the PNAC blueprint. From this it seems that the so-called "war on terrorism"
is being used largely as bogus cover for achieving wider US strategic
geopolitical objectives.
Indeed Tony Blair himself hinted at this when he
said to the Commons liaison committee:
"To be truthful about it, there was no way
we could have got the public consent to have suddenly launched a
campaign on Afghanistan but for what happened on September 11"
(Times, July 17 2002).
Similarly Rumsfeld was so determined to obtain a
rationale for an attack on Iraq that on 10 separate occasions he asked the
CIA to find evidence linking Iraq to 9/11; the CIA repeatedly came back
empty-handed (Time Magazine, May 13 2002).
In fact, 9/11 offered an extremely convenient pretext to put the PNAC plan
into action. The evidence again is quite clear that plans for military
action against Afghanistan and Iraq were in hand well before 9/11.
A report prepared for the US government from the
Baker Institute of Public Policy stated in April 2001 that,
"the US remains a prisoner of its energy
dilemma. Iraq remains a destabilizing influence to... the flow of oil to
international markets from the Middle East".
Submitted to Vice-President Cheney's energy task
group, the report recommended that because this was an unacceptable risk to
the US, "military intervention" was necessary (Sunday Herald, October 6
2002).
Similar evidence exists in regard to Afghanistan.
The BBC reported
(September 18 2001) that Niaz Niak, a former Pakistan foreign secretary, was
told by senior American officials at a meeting in Berlin in mid-July 2001
that "military action against Afghanistan would go ahead by the middle of
October". Until July 2001 the US government saw the Taliban regime as a
source of stability in Central Asia that would enable the construction of
hydrocarbon pipelines from the oil and gas fields in Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, through Afghanistan and Pakistan, to the Indian
Ocean.
But, confronted with the Taliban's refusal to
accept US conditions, the US representatives told them,
"either you accept our offer of a carpet of
gold, or we bury you under a carpet of bombs"
(Inter Press Service, November 15 2001)

Given this background, it is not surprising that
some have seen the US failure to avert the 9/11 attacks as creating an
invaluable pretext for attacking Afghanistan in a war that had clearly
already been well planned in advance. There is a possible precedent for
this.
The US national archives reveal that President Roosevelt used exactly
this approach in relation to Pearl Harbor on December 7 1941.
Some advance warning of the attacks was
received, but the information never reached the US fleet. The ensuing
national outrage persuaded a reluctant US public to join the second world
war. Similarly the PNAC blueprint of September 2000 states that the process
of transforming the US into "tomorrow's dominant force" is likely to be a
long one in the absence of "some catastrophic and catalyzing event - like a
new Pearl Harbor".
The 9/11 attacks allowed the US to press the
"go" button for a strategy in accordance with the PNAC agenda which it would
otherwise have been politically impossible to implement.
Terrorism Attacks in US
9/11 - BBC Prior Knowledge
BBC have admitted that this
video is genuine but they refuse to reveal the source of the press release
that stated that WTC-7
(then more commonly known as the
"Solomon Brothers Building") had collapsed...
This news clip is from around 5pm EST on the afternoon of 9/11,
and proves that the BBC had
foreknowledge of how events would unfold that day.
The overriding motivation for this political smokescreen is that the US and
the UK are beginning to run out of secure hydrocarbon energy supplies. By
2010 the Muslim world will control as much as 60% of the world's oil
production and, even more importantly, 95% of remaining global oil export
capacity. As demand is increasing, so supply is decreasing, continually
since the 1960s.
This is leading to increasing dependence on foreign oil supplies for both
the US and the UK. The US, which in 1990 produced domestically 57% of its
total energy demand, is predicted to produce only 39% of its needs by 2010.
A DTI minister has admitted that the UK could be facing "severe" gas
shortages by 2005. The UK government has confirmed that 70% of our
electricity will come from gas by 2020, and 90% of that will be imported. In
that context it should be noted that Iraq has 110 trillion cubic feet of gas
reserves in addition to its oil.
A report from the commission on America's national interests in July 2000
noted that the most promising new source of world supplies was the Caspian
region, and this would relieve US dependence on Saudi Arabia. To diversify
supply routes from the Caspian, one pipeline would run westward via
Azerbaijan and Georgia to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
Another would extend
eastwards through Afghanistan and Pakistan and terminate near the Indian
border.
This would rescue Enron's beleaguered power
plant at Dabhol on India's west coast, in which Enron had sunk $3bn
investment and whose economic survival was dependent on access to cheap gas.
Nor has the UK been disinterested in this scramble for the remaining world
supplies of hydrocarbons, and this may partly explain British participation
in US military actions. Lord Browne, chief executive of BP, warned
Washington not to carve up Iraq for its own oil companies in the aftermath
of war (Guardian, October 30 2002).
And when a British foreign minister met Gadaffi
in his desert tent in August 2002, it was said that,
"the UK does not want to lose out to other
European nations already jostling for advantage when it comes to
potentially lucrative oil contracts" with Libya.
(BBC Online, August 10 2002)
The conclusion of all this analysis must surely
be that the "global war on terrorism" has the hallmarks of a political myth
propagated to pave the way for a wholly different agenda - the US goal of
world hegemony, built around securing by force command over the oil supplies
required to drive the whole project.
Is collusion in this myth and junior
participation in this project really a proper aspiration for British foreign
policy?
If there was ever need to justify a more
objective British stance, driven by our own independent goals, this whole
depressing saga surely provides all the evidence needed for a radical change
of course.
