# WikiLeaks List Exposes at Least 65 Corporate 'Presstitutes' who Colluded 
to Hide Clinton's Crimes

Thanks
to Wikileaks and the
Intercept, in
fact, we now have a list of no less than
65 mainstream "reporters" whose campaign coverage
constitutes propaganda
for the Clinton campaign - and no wonder, considering the
obscenely lopsided drivel
presented by their outlets.
As (actual) journalists
Glenn Greenwald
and Lee Fang
reported on October 9, the
Intercept
exclusively received documents obtained by the source known as
Guccifer 2.0 evidencing Clinton campaign tactics to court
journalists portraying the former secretary of state in a
positive light.
"As these internal documents demonstrate,"
the
Intercept reported,
"a central component of the Clinton campaign
strategy is ensuring that journalists they believe are
favorable to Clinton are tasked to report the stories the
campaign wants circulated.
"At times, Clinton's campaign staff not only internally
drafted the stories they wanted published but even specified
what should be quoted 'on background' and what should be
described as 'on the record'."
One internal strategy
document dated January 2015 - months before Clinton
officially kicked off her campaign in April - with the curious
heading "Earned Media/Next Steps" exposes how the campaign made
an albeit infrequent practice of crafting supposed news pieces
from beginning to completion.
Under the - not-at-all oblique insult to the
fundamentals of journalism - heading "Placing
a Story,"
the memo's author wrote:
"As we discussed on our call, we are all in agreement that
the time is right [to] place a story with a friendly
journalist in the coming days that positions us a little
more transparently while achieving the above goals."
Specifically named as a suggested
journalist plant is Maggie
Haberman of
Politico,
whom they note will assist in doing
"the most shaping"
of the narrative they have in mind.

Haberman, however, is far from the only
pro-Clinton media shill.
As the
Intercept noted, a review of the
metadata for one of the obtained documents
found it had been penned by campaign communications director,
Jennifer Palmieri
- who
created a
list
of ostensible pundits and journalists potentially amenable to
targeting with the pro-Clinton message.

The
Intercept also
revealed
an R.S.V.P. list of 38 media friendliest invited to a
pre-campaign announcement soiree with 'top campaign aides' at
the home of strategist
Joel Benenson last year
on April 10, which was,
"a fully off-the-record
gathering designed to impart the campaign's messaging."
Although the outlets they
represented unsurprisingly included left-leaning,
-
MSNBC
-
Huffington Post
-
Politico,
...the list also includes
journalists from,
-
The Daily Beast
-
Vice
-
Vox
-
The New Yorker
-
People
Magazine

In the Wikileaks document, the true scope of
Clinton campaign skulduggery is revealed in another lengthy
guest list
for a parallel function hosted by Mr. Leaked Emails,
himself, John Podesta, on April 9 last year.
Press secretary
Jesse Ferguson
- who
authored
both lists - wrote to the top members of Clinton's team:
"Here is the current RSVP
list to the Thursday Night (4/9) dinner at Podesta's. As
a reminder, this is with the 25 reporters more closely
following HRC (aka the future bus)."
Although the collusion between the media and
both the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee
has graciously trickled out thanks to leaked documents from
Wikileaks
and others, these lists of named journalists willing to
cross
the line
between journalism and campaigning are shameful - if not
helpful tools to know with certainty whose reporting is
garbage.
In fact, besides obliterating any previous claims of
unbiased journalism made by the once-prestigious media
institutions dotting these lists, the names and practices
described prove mainstream media is effectively moot
- by its own hand.
