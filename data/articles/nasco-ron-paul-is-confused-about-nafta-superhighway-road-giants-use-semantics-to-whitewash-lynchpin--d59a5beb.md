North America's SuperCorridor Coalition (NASCO),
often referred to as a principle player in the proposal for a "NAFTA
superhighway", has hit out at presidential candidate and Texas Congressman
Ron Paul, branding him as "confused" and stating that it's business
"has nothing to do with any of his concerns" over the increasing move
towards a North American Union.
In a letter published in the Des Moines Register,
NASCO's executive director, Tiffany Melvin, J.D., responds to a piece
penned by Ron Paul last November, entitled
Renew Devotion to Freedom, Limited Government,
in which the Congressman referred to the proposed NAFTA highway, stating:
This superhighway would connect Mexico, the
United States and Canada, cutting a wide swath through the middle of
Texas and through Kansas City.
One proposed path takes the superhighway
right through Iowa. This superhighway can be built only by sacrificing
family farms through eminent domain.
Melvin and NASCO respond with the
following:
Paul states the NAFTA superhighway will cut
a wide swath through Iowa. For decades, I-35 has carried international
trade with Canada, the United States and Mexico.
Since the enactment of
NAFTA, people have referred to the existing I-35 with the slogan "NAFTA
superhighway" because it is a major north-south artery that moves a
substantial amount of international trade.
Recently, there have been rumors of a new NAFTA superhighway - a giant
new highway being planned to link the three countries - and North
America's SuperCorridor Coalition Inc.'s promotional map has been used
erroneously as proof that a blueprint of the proposed giant highway is,
in fact, a reality.
NASCO can state unequivocally that plans for a new giant NAFTA
superhighway do not exist. Our map depicts existing transportation
infrastructure not drawn to scale, but enlarged for promotional
purposes.
Paul is confused and has tied separate initiatives together into a
sinister plot to destroy the sovereignty of the United States. NASCO has
nothing to do with any of his concerns.
NASCO is good for Iowa.
There is no dispute over the existence of the
NAFTA superhighway, NASCO admits that it already exists in the form of I35
and other connecting roads.
NASCO is claiming that the proposal to link
Canada, the US and Mexico does not exist on the basis of semantics by
insinuating that NAFTA trade corridors do not incorporate the building of a
"new" superhighway by NASCO itself.
Although this convoluted word play has constituted enough to deflect most
mainstream hack journalists in recent months, it has not swayed those who
have actually researched the North American Union agenda in its entirety,
and that includes
Ron Paul and other members of Congress and
State Houses of Representatives.
NASCO describes itself as a,
non-profit organization dedicated to
developing the worlds first international, integrated and secure,
multi-modal transportation system along the International Mid-Continent
Trade and Transportation Corridor to improve both the trade
competitiveness and quality of life in North America.
It has received $250 million in earmarks from
the U.S. Department of Transportation to adapt existing roads as part of one
NAFTA trade corridor.
Reports indicate that proposals include a 10-lane
limited-access road (five lanes in each direction) plus passenger and
freight rail lines running alongside pipelines laid for oil and natural gas.
One glance at the map of the NAFTA Super Highway as produced by
NASCO makes clear that the design is to connect Mexico, Canada, and the
U.S. into one transportation system.
Toll roads are to be placed upon existing roads in
Security Prosperity Partnership agreements
that bypasses Congress, agreements between the bureaucracies of the US and
Mexican governments, to raise capital to build the Superhighway that will go
South of Texas and into Mexico.
Security Prosperity Partnership documents reveal that out of 85 interstate
highways, 83 of them are slated to go under this agreement and toll roads
are going down on them already. The money from this operation with further
fund the dismantling of US sovereignty by seizing the infrastructure at it's
very heart in a bloodless coup.
The highway is to be linked to the Trans-Texas Corridor the first leg of the
highway which will connect Mexico with the US. This is being overseen by the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
which is a member of NASCO.
The Trans-Texas Corridor is a separate part of
the physical infrastructure but is being built as part of overall plans to
deepen the integration of Mexico, the United States, and Canada in a North
American economic community that is a precursor to further union.
The NAFTA corridor movement also involves
CANAMEX, another trade organization that promotes a Western
tri-lateral route utilizing I-19, I-10, I-93 and I-15 in the states of
Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho and Montana to link the three countries in
trade.
See below...
Another non-profit group, the
North American Forum on Integration (NAFI),
identifies four bands of NAFTA corridors (Pacific, West, East and Atlantic),
all relying primarily upon internationalizing north-south existing
interstate highways into NAFTA trade corridors. Read below.
The NAFI website states the following:
"Following the implementation of NAFTA,
coalitions of interest have been formed in order to promote specific
transport channels, to develop the infrastructures of these channels and
to propose jurisdictional amendments to facilitate the crossing of
borders.
These coalitions include businesses, government agencies, civil
organizations, metropolitan areas, rural communities and also
individuals, wishing to strengthen the commercial hubs of their
regions."
"The North American trade corridors are bi- or tri-national channels for
which various cross-border interests have grouped together in order to
develop or consolidate the infrastructures.
The North American corridors
are considered multimodal in the sense that they bring into play
different modes of transport in succession."
"The infrastructures may include roads, highways, transit routes,
airports, pipelines, railways and train stations, river canal systems
and port facilities, telecommunications networks and teleports."
The government of the province of Alberta,
Canada,
highlights the four trade corridors on its own website,
referring to NASCO's arm as "the NAFTA superhighway".
The Province's Infrastructure and Transportation
division helpfully published online the map of the NAFTA Superhighway seen
opposite.
They also
provide detailed information regarding
their involvement with the aforementioned CANAMEX Trade Corridor,
stating:
CANAMEX was one of the first north-south
corridors designated as a High Priority Corridor under the National
Highway Systems Designation Act.
Actively pursued by Alberta since the
early 1990's, the CANAMEX Trade Corridor links Canada, the United States
and Mexico and stretches 6,000 km from Alaska to Mexico, truly a
pan-American corridor.
The goals of the CANAMEX Trade Corridor are to:
-
Improve access for the north-south flow
of goods, people and information
-
Increase transport productivity and
reduce transport costs
-
Promote a seamless and efficient
intermodal transport system
-
Reduce administration and enforcement
costs through harmonized regulations
Of course, as we have highlighted, such
improvements and efforts to increase the flow of traffic requires immense
funding (hence the
tolls roads which come with their own threat to
freedom of movement) and will incorporate enlargements to
existing road networks. Enlargements that DO constitute the "building of a
new" Superhighway and WILL threaten anyone who owns property wherever the
enlargements need to be made.
The architects of this North American unification are not just in name
merging agencies, laws and regulations, they are physically getting rid of
the borders by buying off and lobbying the politicians at the state level,
who then
hand the roads over to international bodies
and their
subsidiary companies.
An article in MIT's Technology Review magazine,
for June 30, 2006, provides in-depth insight as to how the
Spanish company Cintra has become a leading player in superhighway
toll road projects in both Canada and the US. In 1999 Cintra, working
in conjunction with Australia's Macquarie Bank, won a 99-year contract to
operate Toronto's Highway 407 toll road, now already built and operating in
2007, which happens to run along Canada's premier NAFTA trade corridor.
Cintra is also contracted to operate toll roads in Indiana and on the
Trans-Texas Corridor.
At the end of January we reported on the revelation
that one of Cintra's conglomerate partners, the afore mentioned
Macquarie, has agreed to buy dozens of newspapers in Texas and Oklahoma that
have up until now been harsh critics of the Trans Texas Corridor
superhighway. This indicates a clear example of influence peddling pointing
to racketeering, and a desperate lunge to silence dissent against the
sellout of American infrastructure and the North American Union.
Further evidence of the future planning for the various roads comprising the
"superhighway" can be found in Canadian policy documents. Firstly a document
prepared last year for the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada entitled
Embracing the Future:
The Atlantic Gateway and Canada's Trade
Corridor states:
Since the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement was
signed with the US, later expanded to become NAFTA, Canadians have
reoriented their trade links away from a national focus (east-west) to a
North American focus (north-south)....
As globalization proceeds, not as an offset
to US-Canada trade or NAFTA enlargement and integration, but as a close
complimentary advantage, Canada must adjust its thinking and design
transportation strategies accordingly....
Again we see a call for "an adjustment of
thinking" in accordance with NAFTA enlargement and integration.
A second Canadian policy document was signed on July 30 this year by the
governments of Canada, Ontario, and Quebec which announced a
Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) on the development of the Ontario-Quebec Continental Gateway
and Trade Corridor.
The official press release stated:
Canada's New Government has developed a
National Policy Framework for Strategic Gateways and Corridors to
advance the competitiveness of the Canadian economy in the rapidly
changing field of global commerce.... Future federal gateway and
corridor strategies will be guided by this framework, focused on
transportation systems of road, rail, marine and air infrastructure of
national significance to international commerce.
The Ontario-Quebec Continental Gateway and Trade
Corridor represents the North Eastern portion of the "NAFTA superhighway"
depicted on NASCO's map of existing road networks.
The mainstream media will keep telling you none of this is real, that its on
a par with invading space aliens and that if you believe in any of it you
are totally crazy. And NASCO, who as we have shown are a major
player, will keep using semantics to insinuate anyone who talks about it is
"confused" or has "erroneously tied them into a sinister plot".
Of course, as with a great deal of the agenda for a North American Union,
there is no all encompassing "sinister plot", it operates very
bureaucratically, yet without Congressional oversight, and is unfolding
piecemeal for everyone to see.
However, this does not mean it has not been
carefully planned is not a threat to the Sovereignty of America, Canada and
Mexico.
The agenda is being driven by elitist private interests operating in
cooperation with the globalist think tanks and lobbyists who have
usurped the overriding interests and responsibilities of our governments for
their own corporate gain and the power that brings to them. They
consequently have no duty to the prosperity of the countries involved and
the people who populate them, despite being intimately involved in the
fundamental operation of the infrastructure.
For NASCO to therefore declare that their business "has nothing to do
with any of his concerns" when referring to Ron Paul's exposure of
such activity represents the height of arrogance and insults the
intelligence of any free thinking person living in America, Canada and
Mexico.
