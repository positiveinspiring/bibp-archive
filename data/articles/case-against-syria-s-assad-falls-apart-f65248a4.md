Evidence for
Government Use of Chemical Weapons
Fizzles...
Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Seymour
Hersh recently destroyed
America's claim that 'it
was clearly'
the Syrian government which carried out the chemical weapons attacks.
Now,
the
United Nations weapons inspectors have quietly retracted one of
their main claims implying that Assad we behind the attack.
Former Associated Press and Newsweek reporter -
Robert Parry -
notes:
A United Nations analysis of samples taken
from one of the two sites of the alleged Sarin attack outside Damascus,
Syria, on Aug. 21 found zero chemical weapons agents, and one
UN laboratory backed off its earlier
claim to have found a residue that can result from degraded
Sarin on the remnants of the missile, according to
revisions in a new UN report.
This failure to find Sarin anywhere in
Moadamiyah, a suburb south of Damascus,
undercuts analyses by Human Rights Watch and the New York Times
that relied on a vectoring of the two
attack sites - the other in Zamalka/Ein Tarma to the east where
Sarin was detected - to
conclude that an elite unit of the Syrian military must have been
responsible for the attacks that brought the United States
close to war in Syria.
There were already problems with the
analyses
because of doubts about the flight paths of the missiles and
their maximum range. UN inspectors only had a
rough idea of the trajectories because at least one of the
projectiles appears to have deflected off a building as it crash-landed.
Also, if the two missiles had been fired
from the elite military base of the 104th Brigade of the
Republican Guard northwest of Damascus, they would have had to fly about
nine kilometers though
independent experts have
suggested that
the improvised missiles probably could
go no more than three kilometers.
Plus, the Moadamiyah missile - with its
supposedly lethal payload of Sarin -
would have had to pass over the presidential palace and other sensitive
government sites, a highly risky undertaking if the alleged vectoring
were correct.
But the
revised UN analysis,
attached to a
new report on several other alleged
chemical weapons incidents in Syria, punched a new hole in the notion
that the Republican Guard fired a Sarin-laden missile into Moadamiyah.
The UN inspectors found no chemical weapons agents on the remnants of
the crudely made missile that landed in Moadamiyah (or for that matter
no Sarin anywhere else in the area).
In
the earlier UN report about the Aug. 21
incident, one of two UN labs had detected on a metal fragment what the
lab thought was a chemical residue that can be left behind by degraded
Sarin. But the new analysis withdraws
that finding, an indication of how fragile the chemistry can be in
getting false positives on derivative chemical residue.
The two UN laboratories are now in
agreement that there was neither Sarin nor possible derivatives of Sarin
on the metal fragments from the Moadamiyah missile.
***
In other words, if the only Sarin attack on
Aug. 21 was in the Zamalka area, the certainty that the Syrian military
carried out the assault has been seriously undermined.
The
vectoring cited by the New York Times and Human Rights Watch would
become meaningless since there would be only one flight path of a Sarin-bearing
missile, the one landing in Zamalka.
***
In the Zamalka/Ein Tarma neighborhood, where
a crudely made missile apparently did deliver poison gas, the inspectors
stated that 'the locations have been well traveled by other individuals
prior to the arrival of the Mission
During the time spent at these locations,
individuals arrived carrying other suspected munitions indicating that
such potential evidence is being moved and possibly manipulated.'
The inspectors also said their visits were
in the 'custody' of rebel forces who guided them to the sites and to
alleged witnesses.
Parry also notes that
the United
Nations report strongly
implies that rebels have - and have used - chemical weapons:
The
new UN report, released Thursday, also
assessed other cases of possible chemical weapons use in Syria,
including claims by the government that rebels have used Sarin and other
chemical agents to inflict casualties on government soldiers and
civilians.
UN
inspectors said they 'collected credible information that corroborates
the allegations that chemical weapons were used in Khan Al Asal (near
the northern city of Aleppo) on 19 March 2013 against soldiers and
civilians,' but the inspectors said they
were unable to undertake a complete study because of time delays and
security concerns.
The UN inspectors also examined a few
incidents in the days after the Aug. 21 attack in which the Syrian
government claimed its soldiers were targeted with chemical weapons,
including an Aug. 25 incident at Ashrafiah Sahnaya, a town southwest of
Damascus.
The UN inspectors said they
found evidence suggesting a small-scale attack was made against soldiers
but were unable to establish the facts definitively.
***
Still, the totality of
the new UN report suggests that Syrian
rebels have developed a capability to produce at least crude chemical
weapons and delivery systems, further adding to the possibility that the
Aug. 21 attack east of Damascus could have resulted from a botched rebel
launch of a makeshift missile aimed at government targets or as an
accident.
This has actually been
well-known for some time.
No wonder
many in the military are have
just said no to war against Syria.
Whose Sarin?

Barack Obama did not tell the whole story this autumn when he tried to make
the case that Bashar al-Assad was responsible for the chemical weapons
attack near Damascus on 21 August.
In some instances, he omitted important
intelligence, and in others he presented assumptions as facts.
Most
significant, he failed to acknowledge something known to the US intelligence
community:
that the Syrian army is not the only party
in the country's civil war with access to sarin, the nerve agent that a
UN study concluded - without assessing responsibility - had been used in
the rocket attack.
In the months before the attack, the American
intelligence agencies produced a series of highly classified reports,
culminating in a formal Operations Order - a planning document that precedes
a ground invasion - citing evidence that the
al-Nusra Front, a jihadi group
affiliated with al-Qaida, had mastered the mechanics of
creating sarin and
was capable of manufacturing it in quantity.
When the attack occurred al-Nusra should have
been a suspect, but the administration cherry-picked intelligence to justify
a strike against Assad.
In his nationally televised speech about Syria on 10 September, Obama laid
the blame for the nerve gas attack on the rebel-held suburb of Eastern
Ghouta firmly on Assad's government, and made it clear he was prepared to
back up his earlier public warnings that any use of chemical weapons would
cross a "red line":
"Assad's government gassed to death over a
thousand people," he said.
"We know the Assad regime was responsible
And that is why, after careful deliberation, I determined that it is in
the national security interests of the United States to respond to the
Assad regime's use of chemical weapons through a targeted military
strike."
Obama was going to war to back up a public
threat, but he was doing so without knowing for sure who did what in the
early morning of 21 August.
He cited a list of what appeared to be hard-won evidence of Assad's
culpability:
"In the days leading up to August 21st, we
know that Assad's chemical weapons personnel prepared for an attack near
an area where they mix sarin gas.
They distributed gas masks to their
troops. Then they fired rockets from a regime-controlled area into 11
neighborhoods that the regime has been trying to wipe clear of
opposition forces."
Obama's certainty was echoed at the time by
Denis McDonough, his chief of staff, who told the New York Times:
"No one with whom I've spoken doubts the
intelligence" directly linking Assad and his regime to the sarin
attacks.
But in recent interviews with intelligence and
military officers and consultants past and present, I found intense concern,
and on occasion anger, over what was repeatedly seen as the deliberate
manipulation of intelligence.
One high-level intelligence officer, in an email
to a colleague, called the administration's assurances of Assad's
responsibility a "ruse".
The attack "was not the result of the
current regime", he wrote.
A former senior intelligence official told me
that the Obama administration had altered the available information - in
terms of its timing and sequence - to enable the president and his advisers
to make intelligence retrieved days after the attack look as if it had been
picked up and analyzed in real time, as the attack was happening.
The distortion, he said, reminded him of the
1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, when the Johnson administration reversed the
sequence of National Security Agency intercepts to justify one of the early
bombings of North Vietnam.
The same official said there was immense
frustration inside the military and intelligence bureaucracy:
"The guys are throwing their hands in the
air and saying, 'How can we help this guy' - Obama - 'when he and his
cronies in the White House make up the intelligence as they go along?'"
Chicago University Press - Nymphs by
Giorgio Agamben
The complaints focus on what Washington did not
have: any advance warning from the assumed source of the attack.
The military intelligence community has for
years produced a highly classified early morning intelligence summary, known
as the Morning Report, for the secretary of defence and the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff; a copy also goes to the national security adviser and
the director of national intelligence.
The Morning Report includes no political or
economic information, but provides a summary of important military events
around the world, with all available intelligence about them. A senior
intelligence consultant told me that some time after the attack he reviewed
the reports for 20 August through 23 August.
For two days - 20 and 21 August - there was no
mention of Syria. On 22 August the lead item in the Morning Report dealt
with Egypt; a subsequent item discussed an internal change in the command
structure of one of the rebel groups in Syria.
Nothing was noted about the use of nerve gas in
Damascus that day. It was not until 23 August that the use of sarin became a
dominant issue, although hundreds of photographs and videos of the massacre
had gone viral within hours on YouTube, Facebook and other social media
sites.
At this point, the administration knew no more than the public.
Obama left Washington early on 21 August for a hectic two-day speaking tour
in New York and Pennsylvania; according to the White House press office, he
was briefed later that day on the attack, and the growing public and media
furore.
The lack of any immediate inside intelligence
was made clear on 22 August, when Jen Psaki, a spokesperson for the State
Department, told reporters:
"We are unable to conclusively determine
[chemical weapons] use. But we are focused every minute of every day
since these events happened
on doing everything possible within our
power to nail down the facts."
The administration's tone had hardened by 27
August, when Jay Carney, Obama's press secretary, told reporters -
without providing any specific information - that any suggestions that the
Syrian government was not responsible,
"are as preposterous as suggestions that the
attack itself didn't occur".
The absence of immediate alarm inside the
American intelligence community demonstrates that there was no intelligence
about Syrian intentions in the days before the attack.
And there are at least two ways the US could
have known about it in advance: both were touched on in one of the top
secret American intelligence documents that have been made public in recent
months by
Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor.
On 29 August, the Washington Post published excerpts from the annual budget
for all national intelligence programs, agency by agency, provided by
Snowden.
In consultation with the Obama administration,
the newspaper chose to publish only a slim portion of the 178-page document,
which has a classification higher than top secret, but it summarized and
published a section dealing with problem areas.
One problem area was the gap
in coverage targeting Assad's office.
The document said that the NSA's worldwide
electronic eavesdropping facilities had been,
"able to monitor unencrypted communications
among senior military officials at the outset of the civil war there".
But it was,
"a vulnerability that President Bashar
al-Assad's forces apparently later recognized".
In other words, the NSA no longer had access to
the conversations of the top military leadership in Syria, which would have
included crucial communications from Assad, such as orders for a nerve gas
attack.
(In its public statements since 21 August, the
Obama administration has never claimed to have specific information
connecting Assad himself to the attack.)
The Post report also provided the first indication of a secret sensor system
inside Syria, designed to provide early warning of any change in status of
the regime's chemical weapons arsenal. The sensors are monitored by the
National Reconnaissance Office, the agency that controls all US intelligence
satellites in orbit.
According to the Post summary, the NRO is also
assigned,
"to extract data from sensors placed on the ground" inside Syria.
The former senior intelligence official, who had direct knowledge of the
program, told me that NRO sensors have been implanted near all known
chemical warfare sites in Syria.
They are designed to provide constant
monitoring of the movement of chemical warheads stored by the military. But far more important, in terms of early
warning, is the sensors' ability to alert US and Israeli intelligence when
warheads are being loaded with sarin.
(As a neighboring country, Israel has always
been on the alert for changes in the Syrian chemical arsenal, and works
closely with American intelligence on early warnings.)
A chemical warhead, once loaded with sarin, has
a shelf life of a few days or less - the nerve agent begins eroding the
rocket almost immediately: it's a use-it-or-lose-it mass killer.
"The Syrian army doesn't have three days to
prepare for a chemical attack," the former senior intelligence official
told me.
"We created the sensor system for immediate
reaction, like an air raid warning or a fire alarm. You can't have a
warning over three days because everyone involved would be dead. It is
either right now or you're history. You do not spend three days getting
ready to fire nerve gas."
The sensors detected no movement in the months
and days before 21 August, the former official said.
It is of course possible that sarin had been
supplied to the Syrian army by other means, but the lack of warning meant
that Washington was unable to monitor the events in Eastern Ghouta as they
unfolded.
The sensors had worked in the past, as the Syrian leadership knew all too
well. Last December the sensor system picked up signs of what seemed to be
sarin production at a chemical weapons depot. It was not immediately clear
whether the Syrian army was simulating sarin production as part of an
exercise (all militaries constantly carry out such exercises) or actually
preparing an attack.
At the time, Obama publicly warned Syria that
using sarin was "totally unacceptable"; a similar message was also passed by
diplomatic means.
The event was later determined to be part of a
series of exercises, according to the former senior intelligence official:
"If what the sensors saw last December was
so important that the president had to call and say, 'Knock it off,' why
didn't the president issue the same warning three days before the gas
attack in August?"
The NSA would of course monitor Assad's office
around the clock if it could, the former official said.
Other communications - from various army units
in combat throughout Syria - would be far less important, and not analyzed
in real time.
"There are literally thousands of tactical
radio frequencies used by field units in Syria for mundane routine
communications," he said, "and it would take a huge number of NSA
cryptological technicians to listen in - and the useful return would be
zilch."
But the "chatter" is routinely stored on
computers.
Once the scale of events on 21 August was
understood, the NSA mounted a comprehensive effort to search for any links
to the attack, sorting through the full archive of stored communications.
A
keyword or two would be selected and a filter would be employed to find
relevant conversations.
"What happened here is that the NSA
intelligence weenies started with an event - the use of sarin - and
reached to find chatter that might relate," the former official said.
"This does not lead to a high confidence
assessment, unless you start with high confidence that Bashar Assad
ordered it, and began looking for anything that supports that belief."
The cherry-picking was similar to the process
used to justify the Iraq war.
***
The White House needed nine days to assemble its case against the Syrian
government.
On 30 August it invited a select group of
Washington journalists (at least one often critical reporter, Jonathan
Landay, the national security correspondent for McClatchy Newspapers,
was not invited), and handed them a document carefully labeled as a
"government assessment", rather than as an assessment by the intelligence
community.
The document laid out what was essentially a
political argument to bolster the administration's case against the Assad
government. It was, however, more specific than Obama would be later, in his
speech on 10 September: American intelligence, it stated, knew that Syria
had begun "preparing chemical munitions" three days before the attack.
In an aggressive speech later that day, John
Kerry provided more details.
He said that Syria's,
"chemical weapons personnel were on the
ground, in the area, making preparations" by 18 August.
"We know that the Syrian regime elements
were told to prepare for the attack by putting on gas masks and taking
precautions associated with chemical weapons."
The government assessment and Kerry's comments
made it seem as if the administration had been tracking the sarin attack as
it happened. It is this version of events, untrue but unchallenged, that was
widely reported at the time.
An unforeseen reaction came in the form of complaints from the Free Syrian
Army's leadership and others about the lack of warning.
"It's unbelievable
they did nothing to warn people or try to stop the regime before the crime," Razan Zaitouneh, an opposition member who lived in one of the towns struck
by sarin, told Foreign Policy.
The Daily Mail was more blunt:
"Intelligence report says US officials knew
about nerve-gas attack in Syria three days before it killed over 1400
people - including more than 400 children."
(The number of deaths attributable to the attack
varied widely, from at least 1429, as initially claimed by the Obama
administration, to many fewer. A Syrian human rights group reported 502
deaths; Médicins sans Frontières put it at 355; and a French report listed
281 known fatalities.
The strikingly precise US total was later
reported by the Wall Street Journal to have been based not on an actual body
count, but on an extrapolation by CIA analysts, who scanned more than a
hundred YouTube videos from Eastern Ghouta into a computer system and looked
for images of the dead. In other words, it was little more than a guess.)
Five days later, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence responded to the complaints.
A statement to the Associated Press said that
the intelligence behind the earlier administration assertions was not known
at the time of the attack, but recovered only subsequently:
"Let's be clear, the United States did not
watch, in real time, as this horrible attack took place. The
intelligence community was able to gather and analyze information after
the fact and determine that elements of the Assad regime had in fact
taken steps to prepare prior to using chemical weapons."
But since the American press corps had their
story, the retraction received scant attention.
On 31 August the Washington
Post, relying on the government assessment, had vividly reported on its
front page that American intelligence was able to record "each step" of the
Syrian army attack in real time,
"from the extensive preparations to the
launching of rockets to the after-action assessments by Syrian
officials".
It did not publish the AP corrective, and the
White House maintained control of the narrative.
So when Obama said on 10 September that his administration knew Assad's
chemical weapons personnel had prepared the attack in advance, he was basing
the statement not on an intercept caught as it happened, but on
communications analyzed days after 21 August.
The former senior intelligence official
explained that the hunt for relevant chatter went back to the exercise
detected the previous December, in which, as Obama later said to the public,
the Syrian army mobilized chemical weapons personnel and distributed gas
masks to its troops.
The White House's government assessment and
Obama's speech were not descriptions of the specific events leading up to
the 21 August attack, but an account of the sequence the Syrian military
would have followed for any chemical attack.
"They put together a back story," the former
official said, "and there are lots of different pieces and parts. The
template they used was the template that goes back to December."
It is possible, of course, that Obama was
unaware that this account was obtained from an analysis of Syrian army
protocol for conducting a gas attack, rather than from direct evidence.
Either way he had come to a hasty judgment.
The press would follow suit.
The UN report on 16 September confirming the
use of sarin was careful to note that its investigators' access to the
attack sites, which came five days after the gassing, had been controlled by
rebel forces.
"As with other sites," the report warned,
"the locations have been well travelled by other individuals prior to
the arrival of the mission
During the time spent at these locations,
individuals arrived carrying other suspected munitions indicating that
such potential evidence is being moved and possibly manipulated."
Still, the New York Times seized on the report,
as did American and British officials, and claimed that it provided crucial
evidence backing up the administration's assertions.
An annex to the UN report reproduced YouTube
photographs of some recovered munitions, including a rocket that
"indicatively matches" the specifics of a 330mm calibre artillery rocket.
The New York Times wrote that the existence of
the rockets essentially proved that the Syrian government was responsible
for the attack,
"because the weapons in question had not
been previously documented or reported to be in possession of the
insurgency".
Theodore Postol, a professor of
technology and national security at MIT, reviewed the UN photos with a group
of his colleagues and concluded that the large calibre rocket was an
improvised munition that was very likely manufactured locally.
He told me that it was,
"something you could produce in a modestly
capable machine shop".
The rocket in the photos, he added, fails to
match the specifications of a similar but smaller rocket known to be in the
Syrian arsenal.
The New York Times, again relying on data in the
UN report, also analyzed the flight path of two of the spent rockets that
were believed to have carried sarin, and concluded that the angle of descent
"pointed directly" to their being fired from a Syrian army base more than
nine kilometers from the landing zone.
Postol, who has served as the scientific adviser
to the chief of naval operations in the Pentagon, said that the assertions
in the Times and elsewhere,
"were not based on actual observations".
He concluded that the flight path analyses in
particular were, as he put it in an email, "totally nuts" because a thorough
study demonstrated that the range of the improvised rockets was "unlikely"
to be more than two kilometers.
Postol and a colleague, Richard M. Lloyd,
published an analysis two weeks after 21 August in which they correctly
assessed that the rockets involved carried a far greater payload of sarin
than previously estimated.
The Times reported on that analysis at length,
describing Postol and Lloyd as "leading weapons experts".
The pair's later study about the rockets' flight
paths and range, which contradicted previous Times reporting, was emailed to
the newspaper last week; it has so far gone unreported.
***
The White House's misrepresentation of what it knew about the attack, and
when, was matched by its readiness to ignore intelligence that could
undermine the narrative.
That information concerned al-Nusra, the
Islamist rebel group designated by the US and the UN as a terrorist
organization.
Al-Nusra is known to have carried out scores of suicide
bombings against Christians and other non-Sunni Muslim sects inside Syria,
and to have attacked its nominal ally in the civil war, the secular Free
Syrian Army (FSA).
Its stated goal is to overthrow the Assad regime
and establish sharia law. (On 25 September al-Nusra joined several other
Islamist rebel groups in repudiating the FSA and another secular faction,
the Syrian National Coalition.)
The flurry of American interest in al-Nusra and sarin stemmed from a series
of small-scale chemical weapons attacks in March and April; at the time, the
Syrian government and the rebels each insisted the other was responsible.
The UN eventually concluded that four chemical
attacks had been carried out, but did not assign responsibility.
A White House official told the press in late
April that the intelligence community had assessed "with varying degrees of
confidence" that the Syrian government was responsible for the attacks.
Assad had crossed Obama's "red line".
The April assessment made headlines, but some
significant caveats were lost in translation.
The unnamed official conducting the briefing
acknowledged that intelligence community assessments "are not alone
sufficient".
"We want," he said, "to investigate above
and beyond those intelligence assessments to gather facts so that we can
establish a credible and corroborated set of information that can then
inform our decision-making."
In other words, the White House had no direct
evidence of Syrian army or government involvement, a fact that was only
occasionally noted in the press coverage.
Obama's tough talk played well with the public
and Congress, who view Assad as a ruthless murderer.
Two months later, a White House statement announced a change in the
assessment of Syrian culpability and declared that the intelligence
community now had "high confidence" that the Assad government was
responsible for as many as 150 deaths from attacks with sarin.
More
headlines were generated and the press was told that Obama, in response to
the new intelligence, had ordered an increase in non-lethal aid to the
Syrian opposition.
But once again there were significant caveats.
The new intelligence included a report that
Syrian officials had planned and executed the attacks. No specifics were
provided, nor were those who provided the reports identified.
The White House statement said that laboratory
analysis had confirmed the use of sarin, but also that a positive finding of
the nerve agent,
"does not tell us how or where the
individuals were exposed or who was responsible for the dissemination".
The White House further declared:
"We have no reliable corroborated reporting
to indicate that the opposition in Syria has acquired or used chemical
weapons."
The statement contradicted evidence that at the
time was streaming into US intelligence agencies.
Already by late May, the senior intelligence consultant told me, the CIA had
briefed the Obama administration on al-Nusra and its work with sarin, and
had sent alarming reports that another Sunni fundamentalist group active in
Syria, al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), also understood the science of producing
sarin.
At the time, al-Nusra was operating in areas
close to Damascus, including Eastern Ghouta.
An intelligence document issued in mid-summer
dealt extensively with Ziyaad Tariq Ahmed, a chemical weapons expert
formerly of the Iraqi military, who was said to have moved into Syria and to
be operating in Eastern Ghouta.
The consultant told me that Tariq had been
identified,
"as an al-Nusra guy with a track record of
making mustard gas in Iraq and someone who is implicated in making and
using sarin".
He is regarded as a high-profile target by the
American military.
On 20 June a four-page top secret cable summarizing what had been learned
about al-Nusra's nerve gas capabilities was forwarded to David R. Shedd,
deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
"What Shedd was briefed on was extensive and
comprehensive," the consultant said. "It was not a bunch of 'we
believes'."
He told me that the cable made no assessment as
to whether the rebels or the Syrian army had initiated the attacks in March
and April, but it did confirm previous reports that al-Nusra had the ability
to acquire and use sarin.
A sample of the sarin that had been used was
also recovered - with the help of an Israeli agent - but, according to the
consultant, no further reporting about the sample showed up in cable
traffic.
Independently of these assessments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, assuming that
US troops might be ordered into Syria to seize the government's stockpile of
chemical agents, called for an all-source analysis of the potential threat.
"The Op Order provides the basis of
execution of a military mission, if so ordered," the former senior
intelligence official explained.
"This includes the possible need to send
American soldiers to a Syrian chemical site to defend it against rebel
seizure. If the jihadist rebels were going to overrun the site, the
assumption is that Assad would not fight us because we were protecting
the chemical from the rebels. All Op Orders contain an intelligence
threat component.
We had technical analysts from the Central
Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, weapons people,
and I & W [indications and warnings] people working on the problem
They concluded that the rebel forces were
capable of attacking an American force with sarin because they were able
to produce the lethal gas. The examination relied on signals and human
intelligence, as well as the expressed intention and technical
capability of the rebels."
There is evidence that during the summer some
members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were troubled by the prospect of a
ground invasion of Syria as well as by Obama's professed desire to give
rebel factions non-lethal support.
In July, General Martin Dempsey, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs, provided a gloomy assessment, telling the Senate Armed
Services Committee in public testimony that,
"thousands of special operations
forces and other ground forces" would be needed to seize Syria's widely
dispersed chemical warfare arsenal, along with, "hundreds of aircraft, ships, submarines and
other enablers".
Pentagon estimates put the number of troops at
seventy thousand, in part because US forces would also have to guard the
Syrian rocket fleet:
accessing large volumes of the chemicals
that create sarin without the means to deliver it would be of little
value to a rebel force.
In a letter to Senator Carl Levin, Dempsey
cautioned that a decision to grab the Syrian arsenal could have unintended
consequences:
"We have learned from the past ten years,
however, that it is not enough to simply alter the balance of military
power without careful consideration of what is necessary in order to
preserve a functioning state
Should the regime's institutions collapse in
the absence of a viable opposition, we could inadvertently empower
extremists or unleash the very chemical weapons we seek to control."
The CIA declined to comment for this article.
Spokesmen for the DIA and Office of the Director
of National Intelligence said they were not aware of the report to Shedd
and, when provided with specific cable markings for the document, said they
were unable to find it.
Shawn Turner, head of public affairs for
the ODNI, said that no American intelligence agency, including the DIA,
"assesses that the al-Nusra Front has
succeeded in developing a capacity to manufacture sarin".
The administration's public affairs officials
are not as concerned about al-Nusra's military potential as Shedd has been
in his public statements.
In late July, he gave an alarming account of al-Nusra's
strength at the annual Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.
"I count no less than 1200 disparate groups
in the opposition," Shedd said, according to a recording of his
presentation. "And within the opposition, the al-Nusra Front is
most
effective and is gaining in strength."
This, he said,
"is of serious concern to us. If left
unchecked, I am very concerned that the most radical elements" - he also
cited al-Qaida in Iraq - "will take over."
The civil war, he went on,
"will only grow worse over time
Unfathomable violence is yet to come."
Shedd made no mention of chemical weapons in his
talk, but he was not allowed to: the reports his office received were highly
classified.
***
A series of secret dispatches from Syria over the summer reported that
members of the FSA were complaining to American intelligence operatives
about repeated attacks on their forces by al-Nusra and al-Qaida fighters.
The reports, according to the senior
intelligence consultant who read them, provided evidence that the FSA is,
"more worried about the crazies than it is about Assad."
The FSA is largely
composed of defectors from the Syrian army.
The Obama administration,
committed to the end of the Assad regime and continued support for the
rebels, has sought in its public statements since the attack to downplay the
influence of Salafist and Wahhabist factions.
In early September, John Kerry dumbfounded a
Congressional hearing with a sudden claim that al-Nusra and other Islamist
groups were minority players in the Syrian opposition. He later withdrew the
claim.
In both its public and private briefings after 21 August, the administration
disregarded the available intelligence about al-Nusra's potential access to
sarin and continued to claim that the Assad government was in sole
possession of chemical weapons.
This was the message conveyed in the various
secret briefings that members of Congress received in the days after the
attack, when Obama was seeking support for his planned missile offensive
against Syrian military installations.
One legislator with more than two decades of
experience in military affairs told me that he came away from one such
briefing persuaded that,
"only the Assad government had sarin and the
rebels did not."
Similarly, following the release of the UN
report on 16 September confirming that sarin was used on 21 August,
Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN, told a press conference:
"It's very important to note that only the
[Assad] regime possesses sarin, and we have no evidence that the
opposition possesses sarin."
It is not known whether the highly classified
reporting on al-Nusra was made available to Power's office, but her comment
was a reflection of the attitude that swept through the administration.
"The immediate assumption was that Assad had
done it," the former senior intelligence official told me.
"The new director of the CIA, [John]
Brennan, jumped to that conclusion
drives to the White House and says:
'Look at what I've got!'
It was all verbal; they just waved the
bloody shirt.
There was a lot of political pressure to
bring Obama to the table to help the rebels, and there was wishful
thinking that this [tying Assad to the sarin attack] would force Obama's
hand:
'This is the Zimmermann telegram of the
Syrian rebellion and now Obama can react.'
Wishful thinking by the Samantha Power wing
within the administration. Unfortunately, some members of the Joint
Chiefs who were alerted that he was going to attack weren't so sure it
was a good thing."
The proposed American missile attack on Syria
never won public support and Obama turned quickly to the UN and the Russian
proposal for dismantling the Syrian chemical warfare complex.
Any possibility of military action was
definitively averted on 26 September when the administration joined Russia
in approving a draft UN resolution calling on the Assad government to get
rid of its chemical arsenal. Obama's retreat brought relief to many senior
military officers.
(One high-level special operations adviser told
me that the ill-conceived American missile attack on Syrian military
airfields and missile emplacements, as initially envisaged by the White
House, would have been "like providing close air support for al-Nusra".)
The administration's distortion of the facts surrounding the sarin attack
raises an unavoidable question: do we have the whole story of Obama's
willingness to walk away from his "red line" threat to bomb Syria?
He had claimed to have an iron-clad case but
suddenly agreed to take the issue to Congress, and later to accept Assad's
offer to relinquish his chemical weapons. It appears possible that at some
point he was directly confronted with contradictory information: evidence
strong enough to persuade him to cancel his attack plan, and take the
criticism sure to come from Republicans.
The UN resolution, which was adopted on 27 September by the Security
Council, dealt indirectly with the notion that rebel forces such as al-Nusra
would also be obliged to disarm:
"no party in Syria should use, develop,
produce, acquire, stockpile, retain or transfer [chemical] weapons."
The resolution also calls for the immediate
notification of the Security Council in the event that any "non-state
actors" acquire chemical weapons.
No group was cited by name.
While the Syrian regime continues the process of
eliminating its chemical arsenal, the irony is that, after Assad's stockpile
of precursor agents is destroyed, al-Nusra and its Islamist allies could end
up as the only faction inside Syria with access to the ingredients that can
create sarin, a strategic weapon that would be unlike any other in the war
zone.
There may be more to negotiate.
