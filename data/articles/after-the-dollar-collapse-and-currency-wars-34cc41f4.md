"We're an empire now, and when we act, we
create our own reality.
And while you're studying that reality -
judiciously, as you will - we'll act again, creating other new
realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out.
We're history's actors... and you, all of
you, will be left to just study what we do."
Karl Rove
The Criminal Elite have been very successful in
remaining in power by using the age old play book of the Hegelian Dialectic.
The conflict between two seemingly opposite false choices for a
predetermined synthesis solution. These rigged battles tend to be only
emotional conflicts that never look at the logic of what they are really
fighting over. The democrats and republicans are the easiest to see.
They emotionally fight over issues of no real
importance like abortion or gay marriage but the logical eye would see that
underneath all of the fluster the REAL agenda is constantly pushed forward,
more debts, more regulation, more war, more jobs shipped over seas, more
loss of liberties etc...
"The best way to control the opposition is
to lead it ourselves."
Lenin
Today I want to expose another one of these
Hegelian dialectics that I believe will allow the current criminal elite to
control the next paradigm and our children's future.
The Criminal elite know that the dollar is
coming to its mathematically inevitable end where the amount of new debt
needed to enter the system to keep it functioning will lead to a hyper
inflationary depression.
Since their entire paradigm is based off of
loyalty to the dollar they desperately need to create another perceived
reality for them to continue their power and profits.
The CIA has gone from fighting communists and terrorists to looking at
money. They know that the greatest threat to their power is the failure of
the dollar. They have held many conferences and simulations studying money
and even taking interest in
the Bitcoin only to coincidently have the
largest Bitcoin market hacked and crashed 5 days later.
While Bitcoin is just a small experiment of the
final false currency that will emerge out for the serfs to slave away for
more illusionary wealth in the future, there is a much larger real game at
stake here.
This is where the big boys play.
"The illusion of freedom will continue as
long as it's profitable to continue the illusion.
At the point where the illusion becomes too
expensive to maintain, they will just take down the scenery, they will
pull back the curtains, they will move the tables and chairs out of the
way and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theater."
Frank Zappa
The collapse of the dollar will lead to the
anger phase of humanity as millions of Americans come to the stark reality
that their entire life has been spent chasing an illusion that has failed
them.
They will realize that they have no REAL wealth, Real skills or Real
Friends. This will lead to riots and millions of antidepressant addicted
individuals having psychotic breaks from reality resulting in some of the
most inhuman crimes.
On a global level there will be a real rush to secure the real assets of the
world.
The first rush will be
to gold which is why nations like
Venezuela,
Germany, Austria, Russia and China are buying and bringing home their gold
to prepare. The next level will be the energy resources of the world which
will lead to regional or even global war for the real assets of the world.
At some point the wars and fires will burn out
and we will see a new order establish itself.
