# NSA has Built its Own, Secret, Warrantless, Shadow Social Network, and 
You've Already Joined It

Soon after the very earliest reporting
on
Ed Snowden's
leaked documents about PRISM, the folks from
Datacoup
put together the very amusing
GETPRSM
website, which looks very much like the announcement of a new social
network, but (the joke is) it's really the NSA scooping up all our
data and making the connections. It's pretty funny.
Except, of course, when you find out
that it's real. And, yes, that seems to be the latest revelation out
of Ed Snowden's leaks.
The NY Times has an article by James
Risen and Laura Poitras (what a combo reporting team there!)
detailing how the NSA
has basically built its own "shadow" social network in which it
tries to create a "social graph" of pretty much everyone that
everyone knows, foreign or American, and it all happens (of course)
without a warrant.
And, note, this is relatively new:
The agency was authorized to conduct
"large-scale graph analysis on very large sets of communications
metadata without having to check foreignness" of every e-mail
address, phone number or other identifier, the document said.
Because of concerns about infringing on the privacy of American
citizens, the computer analysis of such data had previously been
permitted only for foreigners.
The agency can augment the communications data with material
from public, commercial and other sources, including bank codes,
insurance information,
Facebook profiles, passenger manifests,
voter registration rolls and GPS location information, as well
as property records and unspecified tax data, according to the
documents.
They do not indicate any restrictions on the use of
such "enrichment" data, and several former senior Obama
administration officials said the agency drew on it for both
Americans and foreigners.
There were apparently two policy changes
that allowed this to happen, and both occurred in the past three
years.
First, in November of 2010, the NSA was allowed to start
looking at phone call and email logs of Americans to try to help
figure out associations for "foreign intelligence purposes."
Note
that phrase. We'll come back to it.
For years, the NSA had been
barred from viewing any content on US persons, and the NSA,
President Obama and others have continued to insist to this day that
there are minimization procedures that prevent spying on Americans.
Except, this latest revelation shows that, yet again, this isn't
actually true.
The second policy change came in January of 2011, when the NSA was
told it could start creating this massive "social graph" on
Americans without having to make sure they weren't Americans any
more, as indicated above.
Somewhat amazingly, the new report notes that in 2006, the NSA asked
the Justice Department for permission to do exactly this sort of
thing, and was rejected, saying that a "misuse" of that kind of data
"could raise serious concerns."
Indeed, it could, and does raise
serious concerns, but apparently the current administration just
doesn't give a crap.
If all of this sounds familiar, it's
almost exactly what the feds tried to setup in 2002 with the
Orwellian name
Total Information Awareness.
Except that time (right after 9/11,
when you'd think the public would be at its most receptive to such
programs), as word got out about the program, the public rightly
flipped out, and we were told the program was shuttered.
Except, as
some have been arguing for years, it was never shuttered, it was
just rebuilt in secret.
And, of course, the NSA is still willing to defend this massive
breach on Americans' privacy:
An agency spokeswoman, asked about
the analyses of Americans data, said,
"All data queries must include a
foreign intelligence justification, period."
"All of NSAs work has a foreign intelligence purpose," the
spokeswoman added. "Our activities are centered on
counterterrorism, counter-proliferation and cyber-security."
Note the continued shift in language.
For a while, they kept saying that the NSA does no surveillance on
Americans at all. At all! They insisted that would be illegal.
Then,
later, people started to note that they would use the phrase
"targeting foreign intelligence" which had just enough (barely)
wiggle room to get people to think that they were only looking at
non-US person data and content, but really meant as long as the
overall investigation "targeted" foreign intelligence, it was
fine.
Now they're even walking back from that, and saying that
apparently it's fine to spy on Americans without a warrant so long
as there's "a foreign intelligence justification."
In short:
if you can come up with some excuse for how it might impact
something foreign, the NSA can spy on Americans without a warrant.
That's no limitation at all. In fact, such a rule is meaningless. We
already know that the NSA gets every telephone record handed
over because they claim it's "necessary" to "connect the dots" on
foreign terror plots.
And, similarly, now they're arguing that they
can look at anything else so long as they claim that there's a
"foreign intelligence justification."
That means they have no
limits. They just have to come up with some wacky reason to claim
that so-and-so might have foreign connections that are important to
know about, and voila, their life is open for the NSA to dig in, all
without any oversight or a warrant.
Somewhat surprisingly, the already disclosed phone metadata dragnet
is actually not used for this social network effort, but that
doesn't mean the NSA is lacking in data with which to create this
shadow spying social network.
It uses the NSA's taps on fiber optic
networks, the ones that collect a ton of internet data, as Dianne
Feinstein
confirmed last week.
The NSA documents show that one
of the main tools used for chaining phone numbers and e-mail
addresses has the code name Mainway.
It is a repository into
which vast amounts of data flow daily from the agencys
fiber-optic cables, corporate partners and foreign computer
networks that have been hacked.
The documents show that significant amounts of information from
the United States go into Mainway. An internal NSA bulletin,
for example, noted that in 2011 Mainway was taking in 700
million phone records per day.
In August 2011, it began
receiving an additional 1.1 billion cellphone records daily
from an unnamed American service provider under Section 702 of
the 2008 FISA Amendments Act, which allows for the collection of
the data of Americans if at least one end of the communication
is believed to be foreign.
Um... That's an awful lot of records on
Americans.
And yet, we're still being told that the NSA doesn't spy
on Americans? Yeah, right.
Anyway, it appears that the GETPRSM social network has been in
existence for quite some time now, and don't worry if you haven't
received your invite. You've already joined.
