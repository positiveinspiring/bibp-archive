Called "Revenue Watch" it
claims to be,
"a
non-profit policy institute and grant-making organization that promotes the
effective, transparent and accountable management of oil, gas and mineral
resources for the public good.
Through capacity building, technical
assistance, research and advocacy, we help countries realize the development
benefits of their natural resource wealth."
In reality, it is a Wall Street-London centric front of monolithic
proportions that ensures foreign competitors, including nationalized
companies, are prevented from exploiting in many cases their own national
resources, so that they may be reserved instead for the West's corporate
giants to plunder them.
In many cases, this includes funding and organizing
opposition groups to take to the streets and physically stop ongoing
projects under humanitarian and environmental pretenses.
Video: Thomas Barnett building an
army of "system administrators" (aka civil society) to expand
into "peace spaces" while US global military conquers "battle
spaces." Soros' Revenue Watch along with the National Endowment
for Democracy have created just such an army of NGOs. And just
as soldiers witlessly promote imperialism believing they are
fighting for "freedom," these NGOs expand Wall Street and
London's global hegemony, believing they are promoting "human
rights."
A look at
Revenue Watch's "partners" page
reveals what at only a superficial glance appears to be well-intentioned,
noble civil endeavors. However, upon closer examination, a different story
is told.
Who's Partnered With Soros' Revenue Watch?
What the "partners" page represents is an interconnected, incestuous network
leading each time back to,
...all of
which are directly partnered with the largest banking, big oil, defense
contractors, and consumer multinationals on earth.
The very first "partner" on Revenue Watch's list, Democratic Republic of
Congo's Action Contre lImpunit√© pour les Droits Humains (ACIDH), is
entirely funded by,
Other organizations listed, such as "RAID" and CEE Bank Watch
Network (itself a Revenue Watch partner), are in turn,
...funded fronts.
The African Centre For Media Excellence fails to list who in fact funds
them, but they do report that their "Reporting on Oil, Gas and Minerals"
training courses are conducted in partnership with Penplusbytes (listed as
OSIWA & OSISA respectively and a Revenue Watch partner itself) and Thomson
Reuters Foundation (page 42) both of which are Soros-funded, while the
latter is also funded by US State Department-funded BBC World Service.
One
can only wonder why corporate-financier interests would be involved in
"training" locals on how to report about their own natural resources, to
prevent exploitation, or help facilitate it?
Other partners include the Canadian and Australian government-funded
Parliamentary Centre and the Soros-funded "Publish What You Pay," which
polices governments of resource-rich nations on how much money they receive
from multinational corporations and how they spend it.
Middle East & Asia
The British DFID, UNDP,
Soros-funded TIRI, and World
Bank-funded, Integrity Watch Afghanistan.
The resource management-oriented
Indonesian-based Institute for Essential Services Reform, created by USAID,
the Asian Development Bank and Germany's KfW "development bank."
The Iraqi
Institute for Economic Reform (IIER) whose board of trustees includes Dr.
Kamal Al-Basri formally of General Electric Capital, Barclays, and Lloyds
Bank and Mustafa Al-Shawi a professor of Salford University, UK and a
consultant for UN and World Bank projects, and who under a category titled
"other activities" claims to be "doing business with World Bank."
The IIER
also claims to have,
"good working relationships with several
international ogranizations and NGOs including CIPE, IRI, USIP, and CATO
Institute."
Of course
CIPE is funded by the US State Department, the
National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which also funds the IRI
(International Republican Institute), and USAID.
The USIP (US Institute of
Peace) is also a creation of the US government. In other words - the IIER is
seeking "economic reform" according to Wall Street and London's interests.
Africa
The African Conservation Foundation funded by British Airways,
defense contractor Esri, Microsoft, and the "Food and Agriculture
Organization of the UN (FAO).
The Soros, Ford Foundation, DFID, Australian
Aid, USAID, World Bank, Tides, European Commission-funded Agency for
Cooperation and Research in Development.
The Ford Foundation, EU, US &
British government-funded "Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association."
The Improprieties
While it is clear that despite the myriad of organizations listed within
Revenue Watch's "partner" list, with pages of smiling brown children,
giraffes, green meadows, and windmills, it all leads back to a handful of
government and corporate-funded foundations, and this alone should warrant
cautious scrutiny, a tangible impropriety can demonstratively be seen
playing out where Soros and the cabal of corporate-financier elite he
represents are fighting most desperately.
CIA's Otpor fist has made its way around the world from Serbia and
across the "Arab Spring." It is now "punching" Chinese-Myanmar cooperative
development, in particular the "Shwe Gas Project" with funding and support
from NED, George Soros' Open Society, and the OCED.
Amongst the myriad of organizations listed on Revenue Watch's partnership
list, is the
Shwe Gas Movement.
There are no smiling brown people
to be
found here, instead the clenched fist of the CIA's Otpor movement can be
seen "punching" Chinese-Myanmar oil rigs and pipelines, as well as mobs
waving
Wall Street-London creation Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for
Democracy flags in the streets of London.
Video: The Shwe Gas Movement protest takes to the streets of London, waving
the flag of Wall Street-London creation, Aung San Suu Kyi and her National
League for Democracy.
We see
photo galleries where the "Shwe Gas Movement" seems to be attempting
to raise international awareness of the "impact" of a pipeline being built
from Myanmar's southern coast all the way to the north where it continues on
into China.
Aside from muddy construction sites. trucks transporting pipe
segments, and equipment photographed with a temple in the distant background
with the caption "religious area disturbed by project equipment" nothing
seems to be taking place that is any more or less extraordinary than one
would find surrounding any large scale infrastructure project.
Shwe Gas Movement's caption for this photograph reads, "Religious
area disturbed by project [equipment]." One must wonder why the photographer
picked this angle, when a closer view of the temple and how it was being
"disturbed" would have been far more compelling.
Ironically, a visit to the website of notorious extraterritorial meddler and
Neo-Con, corporate-financier chaired National Endowment for Democracy,
reveals money allotted for just this sort of "activity" in Myanmar, still
called by its British colonial nomenclature "Burma" by NED:
"To raise awareness, strengthen local networks, and mobilize activists in
resource extraction-affected areas of western Burma. The organization will
train local field researchers in information documentation and community
mobilization methods and raise awareness internationally and within the
affected areas about the militarys natural resource extraction projects."
We've already seen the US and British governments through an array of
foreign-funded NGOs
succeed in shutting down, at least temporarily, the Myitsone Dam.
The dam, in addition to raising revenue for Myanmar by selling
electricity to China, would have provided a percentage of electricity for
Myanmar, along with flood control, river navigation, and irrigation for the
surrounding region and eventually would end up under full ownership of the
Myanmar government after fulfilling a 50 year contract with China who was
financing and building it.
Clearly the Shwe Gas Movement is part of yet another army of foreign-funded
NGOs working in tandem with similar organizations around the world,
primarily in Africa and Southeast Asia, to prevent the development and
exploitation of natural resources under the guise of human rights,
environmental protection, and any other narrative imaginable that people may
be likely to believe.
Could this really be for the sake of human rights and environmental
considerations?
Enter the
Multinationals
Of course, Soros and NED funding projects to shut down the cooperative
development of Myanmar with its immediate neighbor to the north, China,
alone indicates corporate-financier interests at play.
NED's entire board of
directors is represented by certified warmongers, Neo-Conservatives who have
signed their name to the Hitlerian "Project for a New American Century,"
declaring their intentions to establish a 100 year reign of American global
hegemony, and a mixture of corporate lobbyists and consultants.
It is highly unlikely they stopped the Myitsone Dam or are attempting to
stop the Shwe gas project to preserve Myanmar's pristine environment and to
savor the smiles on the brown faces their corporations and war machine have
been devouring since Marine Corps General Smedley Butler wrote "War is a
Racket."
Indeed, at the highest levels funding Revenue Watch's activities
and the myriad of organizations it is partnered with is the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
OCED nations - also looking suspiciously like Wall Street and
London's sphere of influence and NATO's membership.
The OECD was born of the various "international institutions" created by the
victors of World War II to rebuild the shattered world in the shape of their
choosing.
It was the precursor of the European Union and it still exists
actively funding the destruction and criminal consolidation of sovereign
nation-states today. Composed of an Anglo-American axis including the
European Union, it is involved in the UN and the various "aid" organizations
of respective member countries, USAID, DFID, and Austrian Aid for example.
OCED's member countries fund its activities, but that doesn't mean OECD is
anymore under the reins of democratically elected representatives than the
national policy of each member nation.
It has been illustrated in depth that
corporate-funded think-tanks are indeed the creators and purveyors of
Western policy both domestic and foreign.
Likewise, corporate-financier
interests drive the OECD, the driver's seat being its Business and Industry
Advisory Committee (BIAC). In their own words they claim:
"BIAC has contributed much over the past fifty years towards the OECDs work
promoting open and competitive markets, level playing fields and sound
regulation and governance; fighting against protectionism; and enabling
businesses to compete and succeed in an increasingly complex global
marketplace."
Clearly OCED's association with Revenue Watch is much like a thief with a
crowbar - that is to use the organization to pry off the locks of
protectionism and national sovereignty.
Revenue Watch is creating the "level
playing fields" and "fighting against protectionism" in nations that would
otherwise develop their indigenous resources without giving OECD's member
nations an opportunity to profit in markets that surely would not be
considered "open and competitive" from their globalist points of view.
Of
course, the wealth of OCED's member nations was built not only on
protectionism, but in many cases centuries of extraterritorial exploitation,
military conquest, and sweeping global empires.
OCED through its OCED Watch organization counts the above mentioned Shwe Gas
Movement as a member. Open Society is also counted as a US member, along
with "International Rivers" who helped participate in the shutting down of
the above mentioned Myitsone Dam. UK members include Amnesty International
and the above mentioned RAIDS. As a Zimbabwe member, the above mentioned
Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association is listed.
Another Revenue Watch
member, the Democratic Republic of the Congo's "Action Against Impunity for
Human Rights" is listed on the OCED Watch site as a member. And the list
goes on.
OCED's BIAC lists as its member organizations the various chambers of
commerce in each member nation. This includes the Australian Chamber of
Commerce, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Confederation of British
Industries, and the United States Council for International Business (USCIB).
These collectively are the largest corporate-financier interests on earth
and many of the multinational corporations listed also constitute the boards
of directors, trustees, and sponsors of the most influential think-tanks on
earth.
These are the very think-tanks that engineered the wars in Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Libya, and have laid plans to topple Syria and enact regime change
in Iran. They are also the think-tanks that have articulated an agenda of
realigning ASEAN against China to encircle and contain the rising
superpower, militarily and economically.
When we see Wall Street's George Soros in tandem with the UN and OCED
funding NGOs trying to stop Chinese-Myanmar pipelines and dams that benefits
both nations, it is clearly being done as part of implementing these
documented plans to balk China's rise and prevent the development of nations
in the region.
It is not that Soros and the OCED want to preserve Myanmar's
resources for the people of Myanmar, it is that they want those resources,
the wealth and power they represent for themselves while denying any nation
the ability to rise and possibly compete with the Wall Street London
international order.
From
SSI's 2006 "String of Pearls" report detailing a strategy of
containment for China. The blue arrow represents China's logistical
life-line and the nation's it passes. It also represents the target of Wall
Street and London regime change efforts, destabilization, and meddling NGOs
seeking to cut it.
With
OCED's BIAC corporate-sponsors including,
-
DuPont
-
ExxonMobil
-
GlaxoSmithKline
-
Nestle
-
Shell
-
Unilever,
...and others, behind the same
think-tanks that destabilized and carried out an armed proxy NATO invasion
of Libya, ousting Chinese and Russian interests and rushing in with Western
contracts, it is clear what they intend to do in other regions of the world
where they direct their feigned humanitarian concerns.
In Libya, we even saw
the installation of a Petroleum Institute chairman, Abdurrahim el-Keib, as
"prime minster."
In Uganda, British firms under the cover of fake
environmentalism had 20,000 people forcibly evicted from their property to
"plant trees" and cash in on the carbon trading pyramid scheme.
Indeed, Revenue Watch is nothing more than a feel-good fraud drawing in
countless well-intentioned people from around the world, some of them
risking their lives for what is essentially the construction of a 21st
century corporate-financier ruled global empire. It is an empire where
everyone will lose except those at the very top.
And despite Soros'
assurances that he is a left-wing liberal and the endless slide shows of
smiling Africans playing on his websites, he is indeed amongst one of the
most vicious, persistent corporate-fascist facilitators alive.
Ready to Put Down that
Pepsi?
While the scale of Revenue Watch and the Soros-OCED-corporate-fascist nexus
driving it seems monolithic and indomitable, tracing back to the source of
their power we find individual consumers like you and me.
By identifying the
corporate-financier interests driving this, listed conveniently by
the USCIB
on their membership directory and in the annual reports of think-tanks
across the Western world, we can then begin boycotting and replacing them
with local solutions.
While it may seem like doing something as small as
not buying Coke or Pepsi
is an act of futility, it is exactly everyone buying one or two products a
day from these giant, global spanning multinationals that have granted them
this unwarranted influence in the first place.
In a world where so much is
out of our reach and beyond our control, reading this article, being
outraged, and immediately doing something about is most certainly not.
