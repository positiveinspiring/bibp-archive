Global Research Editor's Note
On October 27, 2010, a computer failure emerged at the FE Warren Air
force Base in Wyoming.
"Mr President we've lost control of FIFTY nuclear
warheads"
"Pentagon chiefs were stunned to discover that a U.S. air force base had
lost control of 50 nuclear, inter-continental missiles.
A power failure meant that one-ninth of Americas nuclear arsenal went
offline for three-quarters of an hour, it emerged yesterday. Minuteman
missile: Computer breakdown meant the U.S. Air Force lost control for 45
minutes
As multiple error codes appeared on the computer control system at FE
Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, the Minuteman III missiles went into
LF Down status, which meant that officers were unable to communicate
with them.
Defense officials insisted yesterday there was never any danger of an
accidental launch. But the incident was deemed serious enough for
Barack
Obama to be
briefed on it later.
The failure involved the launch control computers at F.E. Warren Air
Force Base in Wyoming,
"causing a loss of communication with the
missiles".
"The failure also meant that certain security protocols were down as
well. While the missiles were still able to be launched, control was
only possible via an airborne communications platform." (Failure at U.S.
Air Force Base Takes 50 Nukes Offline)
This is not the first time there is a "glitch" in the control over
America's nuclear arsenal. Invariably, these failures are not reported.
A far more serious incident emerged in August 2007. As documented by CRG
Research Associate Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya, several nuclear warheads
actually disappeared.
In total there were six W80-1 nuclear warheads armed on AGM-129 Advanced
Cruise Missiles (ACMs) that were lost.
This was not a computer glitch. It was something far more serious.
"There is a rigorous, almost inflexible, chain of command in regards to
the handling of nuclear weapons".
Why then did these nuclear warheads go missing?
Nazemroaya's research suggests that "unauthorized removal" of nuclear
warheads is an impossibility unless the chain of command is bypassed,
"involving the deliberate tampering of the paperwork and tracking
procedures."
The incident went virtually unreported and was casually categorized by
the media as "negligence".
See below, Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya's detailed analysis, published in October
2007, on how these nukes went missing.

Missing Nukes on
August 29-30, 2007
by Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya
October 29, 2007
from
GlobalResearch Website
According to a wide range of reports, several nuclear bombs were lost for
36 hours after taking off August 29/30, 2007 on a cross-country journey
across the U.S., from U.S.A.F Base Minot in North Dakota to U.S.A.F. Base
Barksdale in Louisiana. [1]
Reportedly, in total there were six
W80-1 nuclear warheads armed on AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missiles (ACMs) that
were lost. [2]
The story was first reported by the Military
Times, after military servicemen leaked the story.
It is also worth noting that on August 27, 2007, just days before the "lost"
nukes incident, three B-52 Bombers were performing special missions under
the direct authorization of General Moseley, the Chief of Staff of the U.S.
Air Force. [3] The exercise was reported as being an aerial
information and image gathering mission.
The base at Minot is also home of
the 91st Space Wings, a unit under the command of Air Force Space Command (AFSPC).
According to official reports, the U.S. Air Force pilots did not know that
they were carrying weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Once in Louisiana,
they also left the nuclear weapons unsecured on the runway for several
hours.[4]
U.S. Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans, and
Requirements, Major-General Richard Y. Newton III commented on the incident,
saying there was an,
unprecedented series of procedural errors, which
revealed an erosion of adherence to weapons-handling standards [5]
These statements are misleading.
The lax security was not the result of
procedural negligence within the U.S. Air Force, but rather the consequence
of a deliberate tampering of these procedures.
If a soldier, marine, airman, or sailor were even to be issued a rifle and
rifle magazine - weaponry of a far lesser significance, danger, and cost -
there is a strict signing and accountability process that involves a chain
of command and paperwork. This is part of the set of military checks and
balances used by all the services within the U.S. Armed Forces.
Military servicemen qualified to speak on the subject will confirm that
there is a stringent nuclear weapons handling procedure.
There is a
rigorous, almost inflexible, chain of command in regards to the handling of
nuclear weapons and not just any soldier, sailor, airman, or marine is
allowed to handle nuclear weapons. Only servicemen specialized in specific
handling and loading procedures, are perm certified to handle, access and
load nuclear warheads.
Every service personnel that moves or even touches these weapons must sign a
tracking paper and has total accountability for their movement. There is
good reason for the paperwork behind moving these weapons.
The military
officers that order the movement of nuclear weapons, including base
commanders, must also fill out paper forms.
In other words, unauthorized removal of nuclear weapons would be virtually
impossible to accomplish unless the chain of command were bypassed,
involving, in this case, the deliberate tampering of the paperwork and
tracking procedures.
The strategic bombers that carried the nuclear weapons also could not fly
with their loaded nuclear weaponry without the authorization of senior
military officials and the base commander. The go-ahead authorization of
senior military officials must be transmitted to the servicemen that upload
the nuclear weapons.
Without this authorization no flights can take place.
In the case of the missing nukes, orders were given and flight permission
was granted. Once again, any competent and eligible U.S. Air Force member
can certify that this is the standard procedure.
There are two important questions to be answered in relation to the "lost"
nukes incident:
-
Who gave the order to arm the W80-1 thermonuclear warheads on the AGM-129
Advanced Cruise Missiles (ACMs)? At what level in the military hierarchy did
this order originate? How was the order transmitted down the command chain?
-
If this was not a procedural error, what was the underlying
military-political objective sought by those who gave the orders?
The Impossibility of
"Losing" Nuclear Weapons
As Robert Stormer, a former U.S. lieutenant-commander in the U.S. Navy, has
commented:
Press reports initially cited the Air Force mistake of flying
nuclear weapons over the United States in violation of Air Force standing
orders and international treaties, while completely missing the more
important major issues, such as how six nuclear cruise missiles got loose to
begin with. [6]
Stormer also makes a key point, which is not exactly a secret:
There is a
strict chain of custody for all such weapons. Nuclear weapons handling is
spelled out in great detail in Air Force regulations, to the credit of that
service. Every person who orders the movement of these weapons, handles
them, breaks seals or moves any nuclear weapon must sign off for tracking
purposes. [7]
Stormer continues:
Two armed munitions specialists are required to work as a team with all
nuclear weapons. All individuals working with nuclear weapons must meet very
strict security standards and be tested for loyalty - this is known as a
[Nuclear Weapons] Personnel Reliability Program [DoDD 5210 42]. They work
in restricted areas within eyeshot of one another and are reviewed
constantly. [8]
Stormer unwraps the whole Pentagon cover-up by pointing out some logical
facts and military procedures.
First he reveals that:
All security forces
assigned [to handle and protect nuclear weapons] are authorized to use
deadly force to protect the weapons from any threat [including would-be
thieves]. [9]
He then points out a physical reality that can not be shrugged aside:
Nor
does anyone quickly move a 1-ton cruise missile - or forget about six of
them, as reported by some news outlets, especially cruise missiles loaded
with high explosives.
He further explains another physical and procedural reality about nuclear
weapons assembly:
The United States also does not transport nuclear weapons meant for
elimination attached to their launch vehicles under the wings of a combat
aircraft. The procedure is to separate the warhead from the missile, encase
the warhead and transport it by military cargo aircraft to a repository -
not an operational bomber base that just happens to be the staging area for
Middle Eastern operations. [10]
This last point raises the question of what were the nuclear weapons meant
for?
In this context, Stomrer puts forth the following list of important
questions to which he demands an answer:
-
Why, and for what ostensible purpose, were these nuclear weapons taken to
Barksdale?
-
How long was it before the error was discovered?
-
How many mistakes and errors were made, and how many needed to be made,
for this to happen?
-
How many and which security protocols were overlooked?
-
How many and which safety procedures were bypassed or ignored?
-
How many other nuclear command and control non-observations of procedure
have there been?
-
What is Congress going to do to better oversee U.S. nuclear command and
control?
-
How does this incident relate to concern for reliability of control over
nuclear weapons and nuclear materials in Russia, Pakistan and elsewhere?
-
Does the Bush administration, as some news reports suggest, have plans to
attack Iran with nuclear weapons?
It is a matter of perception, whether it is clear or unclear, as to why
the nuclear warheads had not been removed beforehand from the missiles.
For those who have been observing these series of unclear events it is
becoming clear that a criminal government is at the helm of the United
States. There was no way that the six nuclear missiles could have been
mistakenly loaded, especially when their separate warheads had to be
affixed to the missiles by individuals specialized in such a momentous task.
It is also being claimed that military teams in both
U.S.A.F. Base Minot and U.S.A.F.
Base Barksdale made major "procedural errors".
What are the
probabilities of this occurring simultaneously in two locations?
It is also worth noting that original reports from military sources talked
about only five of the six nuclear warheads from Minot being accounted for
in Barksdale.[11] Nuclear warheads are also kept in specialized
storage areas or bunkers.
Moreover, nuclear weapons are not being
decommissioned at Barksdale.
The Role of the
Nuclear Weapons Surety Program - What happened to Electronic Monitoring?
The
Nuclear Weapons Surety Program is a joint program between the U.S.
Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Energy.
The National
Security Agency (NSA) is also involved as well as other U.S. federal
government agencies. The Nuclear Weapons System Safety Program is part of
this program, which involves a monitoring and safeguards regime for the U.S.
nuclear arsenal.
The Nuclear Weapons Security Standard falls under the
Nuclear Weapons Surety
Program and is in place to disallow any,
unauthorized access to nuclear
weapons; prevent damage or sabotage to nuclear weapons; prevent loss of
custody; and prevent, to the maximum extent possible, radiological
contamination caused by unauthorized acts.
Under this or these safeguards system there also exists a rigorous control
of use scheme, which is tied to the military chain of command and the White
House.
Command and Control
(C2) and Use Control
Use control is a set of security measures designed to prevent unauthorized
access to nuclear weapons. These measures involve weapons design features,
operational procedures, security, and system safety rules.
Command and Control or C2 involves the
Office of the President of the
United States of America.
C2 is an established line of command, which is
tied to the White House. Without it, nuclear weapons cannot be deployed or
armed as they were in U.S.A.F. Base Minot.
It is these two control elements
that establish the basis of authorization through which,
absolute control of
nuclear weapons is maintained at all times.
In addition to the checks and balances in place in regards to handling
nuclear weapons, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and its partners
manually and electronically inspect and monitor all U.S. nuclear weapons
through the Nuclear Weapon Status Information Systems.
More Unanswered
Questions: What Happened to the Computerized Tracking System?
The Nuclear Management Information Systems,
interface with each other and
provide [the U.S. Department of Defense] with the ability to track the
location of nuclear weapons and components from cradle-to-grave [meaning
from when they are made to when they are decommissioned]. [12]
The Military Times also makes an omission that exposes the official
narrative as false and indicates that the event was not just a mistake:
The
Defense Department uses a computerized tracking program to keep tabs on each
one of its nuclear warheads, said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear
Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. For the six
warheads to make it onto the B-52, each one would have had to be signed out
of its storage bunker and transported to the bomber. [13]
This is where the chain of command in regards to military officers falls
into play.
If any of the stocked inventories of nuclear weapons are moved to
an authorized location they will be noticed and tracked by the DTRA and will
require the relevant authorization. There is also a code system involved
that is tied to the chain of command.
The fact that the incident only apparently became known to the U.S. Air
Force when military personnel reported it, suggests that either the nuclear
weapons were ordered to be moved or that the electronic tracking devices had
been removed or tampered with.
This scenario would need the involvement of
individuals with expertise in military electronics or for those responsible
for the monitoring of nuclear weapons to look the other way or both.
Mysterious Deaths in
the United States Air Force: Whitewash and Cover-up
Several military personnel died under mysterious circumstances shortly
before and after the incident.
There are now questions regarding the fate of
these individuals in the U.S. Air Force who could have had relationships in
one way or another to the incident or possibly have been directly involved.
It is also necessary to state that there is no proof that these deaths are
linked to the August flight from Minot to Barksdale in question.
Citizens for Legitimate Government has pointed towards the involvement of
the U.S. Air Force in a cover-up and has linked several deaths of U.S.
servicemen to the incident.
Lori Price has also stated for Citizens for a
Legitimate Government that,
you need about fourteen signatures to get an
armed nuke on a B-52.
Based on several news sources, including the U.S. military, we provide below
a detailed review of these mysterious and untimely deaths of U.S.
servicemen.
Todd Blue
Airman 1st Class Todd Blue went on leave days after the nuclear weapons
were lost.
Blue died under questionable timing while on leave,
visiting his family in Wytheville, Virginia at the age of 20 on
September 10, 2007. He was a response force member assigned to the 5th
Security Forces Squadron.
What does this mean?
Airman Todd Blue occupied a key position in weapons systems security at
Minot. [14]
At Minot U.S.A.F. Base the 5th Security Forces
Squadron to which he belonged was responsible for base entry
requirements and a particular section, the Weapons System Security
section, was responsible for preventing the unauthorized removal of
military property. The latter is responsible for security of all
priority resources, meaning the security of nuclear weapons.
In other
words not only did the 5th Security Forces Squadron keep eyes on what
entered and left Minot, but they kept an eye on and monitored the
nuclear weapons.
John Frueh
U.S. Air Force Captain
John Frueh is another serviceman who could have
been indirectly connected to the lost nuclear weapons.
He was reported
as being last seen with a GPS device, camera, and camcorder being
carried with him in a backpack. Local police in Oregon and the F.B.I.
seemed to be looking for him for days. His family also felt that
something bad had happened to him.
On September 8, 2007 Captain Frueh was found dead in Washington State,
near his abandoned rental car, after the Portland Police Department
contacted the Skamania County Sheriffs Officer. [15]
The
last time he spoke with his family was August 30, 2007. He had arrived
from Florida to attend a wedding that he never showed up at.
The
Oregonian reported that,
Authorities in Portland found no activity on
his credit or bank cards since [Frueh] was last seen (...) [and that]
the last call from his cell phone was made at 12:28 p.m. [August 30,
2007] from Mill Plain Boulevard and Interstate 205 in Vancouver
[Washington State]. [16]
His background was in meteorology and the study of the atmosphere and
weather. He was also reported to be a U.S. Air Force para-rescue officer.
[17]
He was also a major-select candidate, which means he was
selected for a promotion as a U.S. Air Force major, but was not
officially promoted.
Captain Frueh belonged to the U.S.A.F. Special Operations Command.
U.S.A.F. Special Operations Command has its headquarters in Hurlburt
Field, Florida and is one of nine major Air Force commands. It is also
the U.S. Air Forces component of U.S. Special Operations Command, a
unified command located at MacDill Air Force Base, which is also in
Florida.
The force provides special operations forces for worldwide
deployment and assignment to regional unified commands, such as CENTCOM.
Its missions include conduct of global special operations.
These
operations - and this is where careful attention should be paid - range
from precision application of firepower, such as nuclear weapons, to
infiltration, exfiltration (the removal of devices, supplies, spies,
special agents, or units from enemy territory), re-supply and refuelling
of special operational elements.
In Captain Fruehs case his death is questionable too. The U.S. Air
Force would not let a missing persons investigation go forward by the
police without conducting its own investigation.
Usually the different
service branches of the U.S. military would investigate for missing
servicemen, to see if these individuals are Absent Without Authorized
Leave (AWAL) or have deserted, before an individuals case is handed
over to the police.
Clint Huff, Linda Huff, and Weston Kissel
Another military weatherman, along with his wife, also died after August
30, 2007.
Senior Airman Clint Huff, belonging to the 26th Operational
Weather Squadron and his wife Linda Huff died in a motorcycle accident
on September 15, 2007. [18]
The husband and wife fatality
happened on Shreveport-Blanchard Highway, near U.S.A.F. Base Barksdale,
when according to the Caddo Parish Sheriffs Officer a Pontiac Aztec, a
medium-sized SUV, initiated a left turn at the same time that the couple
attempted to pass on a no passing zone and collided. [19]
First-Lieutenant Weston Kissel, a B-52H Stratofortress Bomber pilot,
also died in a reported Tennessee motorcycle accident. This was while he
was on leave in, less than two months from the nuclear B-52 flights, on
July 17, 2007. [20]
His death came after another
single-vehicle accident by another Minot serviceman, Senior Airman Adam
Barrs. [21]
Adam Barrs and Stephen Garrett
Senior
Airman Barrs died as a passenger in a vehicle being driven by
Airman 1st Class Stephen Garrett, also from Minot. Garrett, also belongs
to the 5th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron.
The death of Barrs was reported as being part of a single-vehicle car
accident.
Associated Press reports state that,
[Minot] Base officials
say 20-year-old Barrs was a passenger in a vehicle that failed to
negotiate a curve, hit an approach, hit a tree and started on fire late
Tuesday [July 3, 2007] night. [22]
Barrs was pronounced dead
on the scene of the accident, while Garrett was taken the hospital with
no updates released by the U.S. Air Force.
Adam Barrs also belonged to
the 5th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, where he was responsible for the
maintenance and securing of the electronic communicational and
navigation mission systems aboard the B-52H Stratofortresses on base.
The 5th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron is also one of the units that are
responsible for loading and unloading weaponry onto the B-52H Stratofortresses.
The deaths of Kissel and Barrs could be dismissed as irrelevant because
they occurred prior to the incident. However, Barrs and Kissel could
have been in one way or another connected to the advanced planning of
the special operation, prior to the incident (special operations are not
planned in a few days and may take months and even longer).
There is, of
course, no proof and only an independent investigation will be able to
reveal whether these deaths are connected to the incident.
If there was an internal and secretive operation bypassing most military
personnel, a few men in key positions would have to have been involved
over a period of time prior to the August 29/30, 2007 flight.
Senior
Airman Barrs, due to his expertise in communication and navigational
systems, could potentially have been involved in the preparations that
would have allowed the nuclear weapons to escape detection by military
surveillance and be ready for takeoff.
Reprimands,
Replacements and Reassignments in the U.S.A.F. Chain of Command
Senior officers, including three colonels and a lieutenant-colonel, are
among seventy personnel that will reportedly be disciplined for negligence
and for allowing a B-52H Stratofortress Bomber to fly across the U.S.
carrying six nuclear-armed cruise missiles that should never have been
loaded under its wings. [23]
According to the Military Times,
George W. Bush Jr.
had been swiftly
informed. This is a lockstep procedure.
This illustrates the importance tied
to the authorization needed for handling nuclear weapons. This is part of a
two-way process in regards to authorization from the White House.
The commander of the 5th Munitions Squadron and the commander of the 5th
Bomb Wing, Colonel Bruce Emig, have been replaced along with a series of
other senior officers. This implies that the U.S. Air Force chain of command
is directly involved in this event.
None of these senior officers have been
authorized to speak or make statements, according to U.S. military sources.
More generally, the nature of the reprimands directed against senior
officers involved has not been fully disclosed.
The memory of the incident is being erased through a reorganization of the
ranks and a purge at U.S.A.F. Base Minot. The streamlining of the chain of
command as well as the mysterious deaths of personnel who could have been
involved in the incident, raise a series of far-reaching questions.
There are several important issues regarding the senior officers chain of
command at Minot, which will be addressed in this article.
Once again, the
most important questions in regards to the missing nukes are:
Who gave the
orders and authorization for the operation and what where the underlying
objectives of loading armed nuclear missiles?
Other Mysterious
Deaths
Was the Missing Nukes Incident connected to US War Plans
directed against Iran?
Charles D. Riechers
A U.S. Air Force official,
Charles D. Riechers, has been found dead on
October 14, 2007. [24]
Riechers was a retired Air Force
officer and master navigator specializing in electronic warfare.
He was
a member of the Senior Executive Service of the U.S. Air Force, and was
the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for
Acquisition and Management.
A description of his duties includes,
providing sound expert advice and guidance on acquisition and
procurement policies, as well as formulating, reviewing and, as
assigned, execution of plans, programs and policies relating to
organization, function, operation and improvement of the Air Forces
acquisition system.
He apparently killed himself by running his cars engine inside his
suburban garage in Virginia. The death of Charles D. Riechers has been
casually linked by The Washington Post to his involvement in fraudulent
activities and embezzlement. [25]
The Washington Post
reported that the Air Force had asked defense contractor, Commonwealth
Research Institute (C.R.I.), to give him a job with no known duties
while he waited for official clearance for his promoted rank in the
Pentagon.
Riechers is quoted as saying:
I really didnt do anything for C.R.I., and I [still] got a paycheck from them.
The question, of
course, was whether the contractor might expect favors in return upon
his assignment to the Pentagon last January. [26]
A
mysterious suicide letter expressing shame was subsequently reported;
the letter was reportedly from a man who had already admitted without
shame that he was receiving money for doing nothing. This was known to
the U.S. Senate, which had approved his promotion.
In a report featured by Pravda, Russian Intelligence analysts have said
that the reported suicide of Charles D. Riechers was a cover-up and that
he was murdered because of his involvement in the controversial flight
of nuclear weapons over the continental United States.
Pravda reports that,
Russian Intelligence Analysts are reporting today
that American War Leaders have suicided [sic] one of their Top U.S.
Air Force Officials Charles D. Riechers as the rift growing between the
U.S. War Leaders and their Top Military Officers over a nuclear attack
on Iran appears to be nearing open warfare. [27]
According to the Pravda report, the incident was linked to an operation
to smuggle nuclear weapons away from the U.S. military in connection to
launching a war against Iran.
The Commonwealth Research Institute (CRI), a registered non-profit
organization is a subsidiary of Concurrent Technologies, which is
registered with the IRS as a tax-exempt charity, which is run by Daniel
Richard DeVos.
Devos is also an associate of John P. Murtha, who was
investigated by the F.B.I. for his Saudi links.
Certainly the ties of the
Commonwealth Research Institute (CRI), a
non-profit organization working for the Pentagon, are questionable and
the organization could be a front for internal operations that bypass
most military personnel.
The case appears to be part of an internal
operation that was being kept a secret from most of the U.S. military,
but what for?
Russell E. Dougherty
More than a month before the death of Riechers, General
Russell Elliot
Dougherty, a retired flag officer, was also reported to have died on
September 7, 2007 at his home in Falcon Landing military retirement
community in Potomac Falls located in Arlington, Virginia. [28]
He once was one of the most senior individuals responsible for the
nuclear arsenal of the U.S. military and also the former commander of
Strategic Air Command (SAC) and director of the Joint Strategic Target
Planning Staff, which identified nuclear targets worldwide amongst its
responsibilities.
At Minot next to his obituary was a military
information notice on suicide, telling servicepersons what the signs of
suicide are. [29]
Russell Dougherty in the course of his military career in the U.S. Air
Force had dealt with the issues pertaining to Mutual Assured Destruction
(MAD), full spectrum dominance, how to defeat the enemy and avoid a
nuclear war, other uses for nuclear weaponry, Nuclear Primacy for the
U.S., and tackling the effects of the wind and weather - due to their
unpredictable natures - on the use of nuclear weapons.
The fact that the nuclear warheads were attached to the nuclear cruise
missiles could mean that someone wanted to take the weapons in one step
or to use them right away.
Timely Appointments at
U.S.A.F. Base Minot
Several of the commanding officers at Minot were freshly appointed in June,
2007.
This may have been part of standard procedures, but the timing should
not be ignored.
-
Colonel Robert D. Critchlow was
transferred, just before the incident, from the Pentagon to Minot
and appointed commanding officer for the 91st Operations Group, a missileer unit and the operational backbone of the 91st Space Wing.
In Washington, D.C. he was involved in research for the
Congressional Research Services and later posted into Air Force
Nuclear Response and Homeland Defence.
-
Colonel Myron L. Freeman was transferred
from Japan to Minot in June, 2007. Colonel Freeman was appointed as
the commander of the 91st Security Forces Group, which is
responsible for securing Minots nuclear arsenal.
-
Colonel Gregory S. Tims was also
appointed as deputy commander or vice-commander of the 91st Space
Wing in June, 2007. However, Colonel Tims was transfered to Minot
from California almost a year before.
-
One of the most senior non-commissioned
officers (NCOs) or non-commissioned members (NCMs), Chief Master
Sergeant Mark R. Clark, was also transferred to U.S.A.F. Base Minot
from Nebraska in July, 2007.
-
Colonel Roosevelt Allen was also
transferred to Minot from Washington, D.C. to become commander of
the 5th Medical Group.
-
Colonel Bruce Emig, the now-former
commander of the 5th Bomb Wing, was also transferred to Minot from U.S.A.F. Base Ellsworth in South Dakota in June, 2007. Colonel Emig
was also the base commander of Minot.
-
Colonel Cynthia M. Lundell, the
now-former group commander for the 5th Maintenance Group, the unit
responsible for loading and unloading weaponry onto the B-52H Stratofortresses was also freshly transferred from a NATO post in
Western Europe in June, 2007.
Were these appointments temporary?
Were any of these appointments related to the six lost nuclear
missiles?
Prior to the Missing
Nukes Incident
Minot Airmen Meet with the President and the U.S. Air
Force Chief of Staff
On June 15, 2007,
George W. Bush Jr. met senior officers from U.S.A.F. Base
Minot at U.S.A.F. Base McConnell in Wichita, Kansas during a visit to
Boeings Integrated Defense Systems facility. Amongst them was Major Daniel Giacomazza of the 5th Operational Support Squadron.
Senator Patrick Roberts of Kansas was also present.
While he chaired the
Senate Intelligence Committee from 2002 to 2007, [Senator] Roberts
stonewalled attempts to investigate everything from the manipulation of
intelligence in the rush to war in Iraq, President Bushs warrantless
wiretaps, and even allegations of the use of torture by the CIA, according
to Associated Press (AP) reports. [30]
The same report also
indicates that the U.S. President was in Wichita for a political fundraiser,
and stopped at a new Boys and Girls Club of America to defray the costs of
getting to Wichita via Air Force One for Senator Roberts campaign.
Military sources have reported that a B-52H Stratofortress was flown to
Wichita so that Boeings engineers could take a look in order to make
adjustments to the war planes for a new military program. [31]
Nothing has been reported about any private meetings between President Bush
Jr. or any of his presidential staff and the personnel from Minot.
However, reports have been made of meetings
between military families and the U.S. President in his office on Air Force
One.
General Moseley, the Air Force Chief of Staff,
had previously visited Minot on March 14-15, 2007, a month before Minot
airmen went to Wichita. [32]
If a secret mission was being
prepared, these events could have played a role in the recruiting phases for
an important internal special operation.
Following their recruitment, Minot
servicemen could have symbolically met General Moseley or White House
officials to understand that the mission was being sanctioned by the highest
ranks and offices in the United States.
Orders had to Come
from the Top - Treason of the Highest Order
Orders had to come from higher up.
The operation would not have been possible without the involvement of more
than one individual in the highest ranks of the U.S. Air Force command
structure and the Pentagon.
The only way to bypass these separate chains of command is to be above
them (from higher up), as well as to have the possibility of directly
overseeing their implementation.
These orders would then have been communicated to lower levels in the U.S.
Air Force command chain in different locations, to allow for so-called
oversight to proceed. The alternative to this is an alternative chain of
command, although this also needs someone in the highest ranks of office to
organize and oversee.
The post given to Riechers was politically motivated, given his track record
in the U.S. Air Force. Riechers had been in a position of responsibility in
the U.S. Air Force special operational support activities; something he had
in common with Russell Dougherty, the former SAC commander.
He would have
been one of the best suited individuals for making arrangements in the case
of an alternative command structure for a secretive nuclear operation.
Moreover, he already had a record of corrupt behavior through his
involvement with the Commonwealth Research Institute.
The possible
involvement of U.S. Air Force weathermen and special operatives raises many
questions as to what exactly was the objective of making the nuclear weapons
disappear. [33]
The Investigation
The U.S. Air Force has publicly stated that it has made a mistake, which
is very unusual and almost unprecedented for a military organization that
tries to continually assure the American public of their safety.
The fact that seventy or more military personnel have been punished in the
case of the lost nuclear weapons does not mean, however, that the senior
commanding officers responsible for having carried out the special operation
will be identified and punished.
Quite the opposite. The investigation could indeed result in a camouflage of
the chain of command, where lower-ranking military personnel are accused and
court-martialed, with a view to ultimately protecting those in high office
who have committed an act of treason.
The series of deaths mentioned above, may have no ties whatsoever with the
the August flight in question from Minot to Barksdale, but the issues of
command, monitoring, and authorization cannot be overlooked or ignored. The
American people have before them a case of treason that involves the highest
offices of government and most probably the offices of the President and the
Vice-President.
Once again, the C2 process involves the Office of the President and
Commander-in-Chief. It is an established line of command, without which
nuclear weapons could not have been deployed or armed as they were in
U.S.A.F. Base Minot.
It is this command element that establishes the basis
of authorization through which,
absolute control of nuclear weapons is
maintained at all times.
With time it is possible that military
servicemen and servicewomen may come forward with more information.
However, in the meantime, there has been a streamlining of military
personnel at U.S.A.F. Base Minot. Base personnel have become dispersed and
reassigned to other locations.
If they on the grounds of loyalty to their country, the United States of
America, come forward and reveal what has taken place, they are to be
saluted with full honor by all ranks.
As George Orwell said,
In a time of
universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act, and indeed
these are deceitful times.
The fact that U.S. Air Force officers came forward and reported this
incident is contrary to U.S. military procedures, regulations, and laws.
The
U.S. military will never release any information that will risk or damage
its reputation. Any information in regards to nuclear weapons can not be
released without prior consultations with and authorization by the White
House.
The nuclear weapons were armed and moved deliberately. Orders had to have
come from the highest echelons of the U.S. government.
The question is,
Bush Threatens Iran
with Nuclear Weapons
What adds intrigue to an understanding of the missing nukes, are the
international events and war games taking place just after the lost
nuclear weapons incident, not to mention the Presidents ongoing threats to
attack Iran with nuclear weapons and Vice President Cheney's repeated
warnings that a second large scale terrorist attack on America is under
preparation, with the support of Iran.
In the U.S., under the Vigilant Shield 2008 war games (initiated in
September, 2007) and the TOPOFF anti-terrorism exercises, some form of
nuclear terrorist attack on American soil had been envisaged.
The roles of
Russia and China had also been contemplated. The latter would be a likely
scenario had the U.S. attacked Iran and as a result Russia and China had
decided to intervene. [34]
Under Vigilant Shield 2007, held in
2006, the possibility of a nuclear war with Irans allies, Russia and China,
had been contemplated in the war games scenario.
The Kremlin has responded by holding its own war games.[35]
An unveiled threat to trigger World War Three has been the response of
George W. Bush Jr. to Russias statements warning that a U.S. sponsored war
with Iran, could result in an escalating World War III scenario.
The six nuclear warheads were not meant for use in theatre operations
against Iran. This is obvious because if they were then they would have been
deployed via the proper procedural routes without the need to hide anything.
Besides, there are already theatre-level nuclear weapons ready and armed in
Europe and the Middle East for any possible Middle Eastern mission.
There
was something more to the incident.
It is also worth noting that the Israelis launched an attack on an alleged
Syrian nuclear facility that both Tel Aviv and the White House claim was
constructed with the assistance of North Korea. This event has been used,
through official statements and media disinformation, to draw a
Syria-Iran-North Korea nuclear proliferation axis. [36]
In regards to the case of the missing nuclear weapons, weathermen and
military personnel with an expertise in space and missile components were
involved.
The incident took place during a time when the U.S. missile shield
projects in Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia, directed against Russia and
China, were raising international tensions and alarms.
On October 23, 2007,
President Bush Jr. stated:
The need for missile defense in Europe is real
and I believe its urgent. [37]
Nuclear warfare, the militarization of space, and the missile shield are
interrelated military processes.
The overtones of Nuclear Primacy are
hanging in the air. One of the goals of the U.S. military has been to
effectively shield itself from a potential Russian or potential Russian and
Chinese nuclear response to a nuclear First Strike from the U.S. military.
[38]
The militarization of space is also deeply linked to this
military project.
Like their advanced knowledge about the U.S. missile
shield project, Russian and Chinese officials have got wind of these
ambitions and are fully aware of what the U.S. intends to do.

[36] Both the U.S. and Israeli governments cite the arrival of a North
Korean ship with alleged nuclear-related cargo as proof, but one needs
only point out one fact to dislodge this claim. The U.S. government has
setup an internationally illegal program involved in policing the seas
and maritime traffic, the International Proliferation Initiative (IPI).
Under the IPI the U.S. has been illegally stopping North Korean vessels
and inspecting them, especially when they have suspected suspicious
materials. Hereto, North Korea has not been given any carte blanches
from vessel inspections. The U.S. Navy and NATO vessels have a virtual
cordon of the waterways around the Middle East from the Indian Ocean to
the Read Sea and Mediterranean Sea. If the North Korean vessel had
nuclear materials it would never have reached Syria.

[38] It is here that two things should be noted in regards to physics
and magnetospheric physics;
-
Firstly, nuclear explosions from the air
are different than ground-based nuclear explosions in many ways
(including contamination levels), but the weather and wind direction
are major unknowns or variables
-
Secondly, as a fundamental natural law
energy never disappears, it only changes or is transferred. The
energy from nuclear explosions can theoretically be transferred into
the Earth magnetic radiation fields, called the Van Allen Belt or
the Van Allen Belts, and used to energize and excite various
particles, sub-atomic particles, and ions.
Tentatively, if manipulated this can have
harmful results on surface areas, including burning electronic and
communication devices, and military applications such as disrupting
satellites in space. If this were possible Russian, Chinese, Iranian, or
Indian military defenses, communications, and missile facilities could
be effortlessly neutralized.
These radiation belts also travel in loops and notionally an energized
pulse set off from an area in the U.S. could circumnavigate into an area
halfway around the globe.
In fact the U.S. military has been
experimenting with manipulating the radiation belts since the end of the
Second World War. The U.S. Navys Project Argus, taking place from
August to September 1958, is an example.
A total of five nuclear weapons were used;
three atom bombs (weapons using nuclear fission) were detonated above
the Atlantic Ocean and two thermonuclear or hydrogen bombs (weapons
using nuclear fusion) in the Pacific Ocean in an effort to manipulate
the Van Allen Belts.
