PART 1
Wake-up call
January 21, 2012
Global sustainability requires the
deliberate quest of poverty, reduced resource consumption and
set levels of mortality control.
Professor Maurice King
Birth of an
abomination
In simple terms
Agenda 21/Sustainable Development is the end of civilization
as we know it.
It is the end of private property, the elevation
of the collective over the individual. It is the redistribution of Americas
wealth to the global elite, it is the end of the Great American Experiment
and the Constitution. And, it is the reduction of 85% of the worlds
population.
In 1992, twenty years ago this summer, Agenda 21/Sustainable Development was
unveiled to the world at the UNs Earth Summit in Rio. (While
Agenda 21 was
introduced in June, 1992, it was already installed as public policy in
communities across the country as early as 1987.)
In his opening remarks at the ceremonies at the Earth Summit, Maurice Strong
stated:
The concept of national sovereignty has
been an immutable, indeed sacred, principle of international relations.
It is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly to the
new imperatives of global environmental cooperation.
It is simply not
feasible for sovereignty to be exercised unilaterally by individual
nation states, however powerful. The global community must be assured of
environmental security.
If this is true, then he and his cohorts must be
even more against individual sovereignty.
Keep this quote in mind as you read about Agenda
21.
George H.W. Bush was in Rio for the ceremonies and graciously
signed on for America so that our Congress did not have to spend the time
reviewing the treaty and learning then what dastardly deeds were in store
for us - that protecting the environment would be used as the basis for
controlling all human activity and redistributing our wealth.
Definitions of
Sustainable Development
U.N. definition of Sustainable Development:
meeting todays needs without compromising
future generations to meet their own needs.
In actuality, Sustainable Development is not
sustainable unless
the population actually is reduced by the 85% called for
by the globalists.
The true purpose of Sustainable Development and
all of its policies is the control of all aspects of human life - economic,
social and environmental (see 3 Es of Sustainable Development further below).
Here is how
the United Nations described Agenda 21 in one of its own publications in a
1993 article entitled Agenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save our
Planet:
Agenda 21proposes an array of actions which
are intended to be implemented by EVERY person on Earth
it calls for
specific changes in the activities of ALL people
Effective execution of
Agenda 21 will REQUIRE a profound reorientation of ALL humans, unlike
anything the world has ever experienced.
So George H.W. Bush signed the Rio Accord and a
year later Clinton established his Presidents Council for Sustainable
Development which would render the guidelines of Agenda 21 into public
policy to be administered by the federal government via all departments.
In doing this, Bush and Clinton set up Agenda 21
as ruling authority, i.e., implementing a U.N. plan to become U.S. policy
across the whole nation and into every county and town. And every succeeding
president has fully endorsed and implemented Agenda 21 through every
department of the federal government.
If one were to research the source of U.S. policy, one would find that much
of our policy of the last few decades is the outcome of agreements we have
entered into via treaties with the U.N. And that policy has trickled, no
gushed, down into every state and into almost every other jurisdiction -
county, city, town - in the nation; Sustainable Development is the official
policy of our country even though many citizens are yet ignorant of its
existence.
And this policy encompasses an entire economic
and social agenda.
So what is Sustainable
Development?
According to its authors, the objective of Sustainable Development is to
integrate economic, social and environmental policies in order to achieve
reduced consumption, social equity, and the preservation and restoration of
biodiversity (the 3Es of sustainability).
They insist that every societal decision be
based on environmental impact, focusing on three components; global land
use, global education, and global population control and reduction.
Look at these words, they are part of the new vocabulary:
Free trade, open space, smart growth, smart
food, smart buildings, regional planning, walkable, bikeable, foodsheds,
viewsheds, consensus, partnerships, preservation, stakeholders, land
use, environmental protection, development, diversity, visioning, social
justice, heritage, carbon footprints, comprehensive planning, critical
thinking, community service, regional planning.
All of these words are part of the Newspeak, the
altering of the English language as a tool to promote a global government
through a diabolical agenda called
Agenda 21.
In fact, the world will be retooled from top to
bottom through this agenda and using the new vocabulary.
This is not just policy but a complete
restructuring of life as we know it. We not only will be taught how we must
live, but where we are allowed to live; taught how to think and what is
acceptable thinking; told what job we will be allowed to have; taught how we
can worship and what we will be allowed to worship; and we will be
brainwashed into believing that the individual must cede all to the
collective.
Private property will be a sin that will be eradicated as will be
free-market economics which will be replaced by public private partnerships
and a planned central economy.
Individualism will be rooted out and social
justice will rule the land.
Social justice is described as the right and
opportunity of all people,
"to benefit equally from the resources afforded us
by society and the environment."
In other words, the redistribution of
wealth.
This will be achieved through an organizational
structure of land use controls:
-
control of energy and energy production
-
control of transportation
-
control of industry
-
control of food production
-
control of development
-
control of water availability
-
control of
population size and growth
And all of this will be decreed under the guise
of environmental protection.
The 3 Es of
Sustainable Development
The 3Es of sustainability which make up the Sustainable Development logo
consists of three connecting circles labeled,
-
Social Equity
-
Economic Prosperity
-
Ecological Integrity
These Es together encompass every aspect
of human life.
First E - Social Equity
Social Equity is based on a
demand for social justice. - in non-Newspeak, redistribution of the
wealth.
Social justice is described as the right and opportunity of all people,
to benefit equally from the resources afforded us by society and the
environment.
Redistribution of wealth. Private property is a social
injustice since not everyone can build wealth from it. National
sovereignty is a social injustice. Universal health care is a social
injustice. [To understand Agenda 21,
click here]
Equity is a system of social justice that works to abolish the
American concept of equal justice in order to pursue the globalist ideal
of the common good. Individuals rights must be abolished for the good
of the collective, just as in Communism; in fact, Karl Marx was the
first person to use the term social justice.
Social justice is an unnatural leveling of
all wealth (other than that of the global elites); no one person is
supposed to profit more than another.
Second E - Economic Prosperity
From Wikipedia comes this discussion of
economic prosperity promoted under
Sustainable Development:
Economic growth is often seen as
essential for economic prosperity, and indeed is one of the
factors that is used as a measure of prosperity.
The Rocky Mountain Institute has put
forth an alternative point of view, that prosperity does not
require growth, claiming instead that many of the problems
facing communities are actually a result of growth, and that
sustainable development requires abandoning the idea that growth
is required for prosperity.
The debate over whether economic
growth is necessary for, or at odds with, human prosperity, has
been active at least since the publication of Our Common Future
in 1987, and has been pointed to as reflecting two opposing
worldviews.
Keep in mind that almost every concept under
Agenda 21 is written in Newspeak - words often have the opposite
meanings of those in your Webster Dictionary so that the general public
might be deceived, at least for a time (and it has been).
Economic prosperity under Agenda 21 is
anything but prosperity - other than for the global elites who are
controlling the system. It is economic ruin for the ordinary people of
the entire globe.
Agenda 21 proponents would have you believe that all of the wealth in
the world was made on the backs of the poor and that the only way that
this inequity can be corrected is to redistribute that wealth.
While they claim that the wealth must be
taken from the American middle class and given to the poor of the world,
in actuality the money will be taken from that American middle class and
given to the global elite (as if they didnt control most of the worlds
wealth already - but that is not the issue; it is to reduce us to slaves
at best).
The poor, in Africa and other parts of the world, will never
see a dime of the redistributed wealth, they are only the pretense for
taking our money.
Agenda 21 encompasses the so-called free trade movement that created
both NAFTA and Public/Private Partnerships which were incorporated into
a government-driven economy called corporatism.
These public/private
partnerships are nothing more than government sanctioned monopolies -
Mussolini style economics.
Third E - Ecological Integrity
To understand the power of the
transformation of society under sustainable development, consider this
quote from the
UNs Biodiversity Treaty which also was introduced at
the Rio Earth Summit:
Nature has an integral set of different
values (cultural, spiritual and material) where humans are one
strand in natures web and all living creatures are considered
equal. Therefore the natural way is the right way and human
activities should be molded along natures rhythms.
This quote says it all; that we humans are
nothing special - just one strand in the nature of things or, put
another way, humans are simply biological resources.
No better than slugs or dung. In fact, in
the eye of the globalist, we are of less value than slugs or dung. Their
policy is to oversee any issue in which man interacts with nature -
which, of course, is literally everything. This is necessary, they say,
because humans only defile nature.
And private property ownership and control, along with individual and
national sovereignty, are main targets of Sustainable Development.
Consider this quote from the report of the
UNs Habitat I conference:
Land
cannot be treated as an ordinary
asset, controlled by individuals and subject to the pressures and
inefficiencies of the market. Private land ownership is also a
principle instrument of accumulation and concentration of wealth,
therefore, contributes to social injustice.
This mixture of socialism, fascism and
corporatism (as Tom DeWeese so aptly pegs it),
called Agenda 21, is the
ruling force in our government today from the federal to the local.
Not one of those ingredients would be allowed by
our forefathers and not one is in sync with the Constitution; so how have we
allowed all three to be combined into a recipe for global government and
served to our unwitting nation?
PART 2
February 4, 2012
In part I above, I gave you the first half of the
overview of Agenda 21. This is part 2 of the overview. Keep in mind that it
is just an overview; I will expound upon the key aspects in later articles.
In order to build a sustainable global community, the nations of the world
must renew their commitment to the United Nations, fulfill their obligations
under existing international agreements, and support the implementation of
Earth Charter principles with an international legally binding instrument on
environment and development.
The Earth Charter
As
Tom DeWeese puts it,
The fact is, Agenda 21 is a blueprint to
completely change our society to a top-down planned central economy in a
strange mixture of Socialism, fascism and corporatism.
This is a
political movement led by those who seek to control the world economy,
dictate development and redistribute the worlds wealth. They use the
philosophical base of Karl Marx, the tactics of Adolph Hitler, and the
rhetoric of
the Sierra Club.
The next order of business for the globalist was
to convince the general public that the fate of the world was at stake, that
we had to do something right now and that something would require us to
not only give up our standard of living but would have us give up our basic
freedoms.
But what could they come up with to achieve all
this - a big order even for the
Maurice Strong's,
Al Gore's and
George Soros' of the world.
In the past we were hit with everything from a new ice age to global food
shortages and starvation. But those dire threats didnt pan out; not enough
people were willing to swallow the Kool Aid yet. But all those New Age
forecasters were not ready to give up on scaring the bejesus out of us.
How else would they achieve their ends?
Heidi and Alvin Toffler, John Naisbitt, Amatei
Etzioni, with
the Club of Rome and the Rand Corporation among others, have
been looking for that exact universal scare to make us beg them to take
control of the world; to have people crying, just protect us.
And what did they come up with? A biggie. Environmental Armageddon. Stop
everything you are doing and the world might be able to correct itself; go
on using natural resources and we doom not only ourselves but the entire
rest of the world.
What could be better?
Put on your hair shirt, get rid of your middle
class home and become one with the earth, i.e., throw out God and turn to
Gaia worship and then maybe, just maybe, the globalists can steer us into a
safe harbor of post-carbon existence.
(Note that we will be living in a
post-carbon world, but the globalists will still be using carbon because
they have to live comfortably so they can better rule over us. Like other
extremists i.e. communists and animal rightists, as soon as they get the
world in control {set up Utopias, free the animals} they will then join us in
the post-carbon nightmare. In their dreams.)
Do you doubt what I am saying, then consider this quote by Alexander King,
co-founder of the Club of Rome:
In searching for a new enemy to unite us,
we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming,
water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill
All of these
dangers are caused by human intervention
the real enemy then, is
humanity.
Do these scenarios sound familiar? Water
shortages, famine, global warming - all in the news daily; all to make
humanity the enemy of Mother Earth, Gaia.
We are constantly being bombarded with news
stories (like the threat of global warming) that make man the evil doer, a
cancer on the face of the earth in spite of evidence to the contrary.[1]
Now that the globalists have decided how to make this wrenching
transformation of society according to
Al Gore, they have been moving quite
swiftly and efficiently. The transformation is to get humans first out of
the rural areas, then out of the suburbs, and when they have us in the
human
settlement areas, to reduce our numbers by civil unrest, natural attrition,
and eventually starvation.
How will this come about?
In conjunction with NGOs (Non-governmental Organizations affiliated with the
United Nations) as well as corporations and private individuals, our state
and federal governments are working to promulgate rules, regulations, fees
and taxes that trickle all the way down to the smallest town, community and
individual citizen.
Our local bureaucrats are either ignorant (or pretending to be) of the fact
that this is all coming down from above - from
the mighty UN and
the global
elite.
They, the bureaucrats, tell us that they are
just working hard to design a template for our future, creating the
necessary planning that will take us and our progeny into the next century
with sustainability for even future generations and centuries. They claim
that none of what they are doing has anything at all to do with the UN; that
they are coming up with these cityscapes with stack-em and pack-em housing
connecting to public transportation on their own.
They claim any talk to the contrary is just the
claptrap of right wing radical conspiracy theorists; they figure if they
tell this lie often enough, as Nazi Joseph Goebbels said, people will
believe it and drink the Kool Aid.
People are waking up to the dishonesty and collusion, enough so that the
powers-that-be, the NGOs and the global elite, are having to rename things
to try to hide them again.
Consider this quote from J. Gary Lawrence,
a planner for the city of Seattle, and an advisor to the Presidents Council
for Sustainable Development:
Participating in a U.N. advocated planning
process would very likely bring out many
who would actively work to
defeat any elected official
undertaking Local Agenda 21. So we will
call our process something else, such as comprehensive planning,
growth management, or smart growth".
Do you see what I mean?
In his new Sustainable Development Manual, Tom DeWeese pulls these quotes
from the UNs Our Common Future: Sustainable Development involves,
...a progressive transformation of the
economy and society (p.43),... international interdependence (p. 47),... redistribution of wealth (p.50),... less material and more equitable
growth (p.50-52),... ensuring a sustainable level of population
(p.55),... merging environment and economics in decision making
(p.62),... and a new ethics that will include the relationship between
man and nature above all (p.71).
Clearly there is more to Sustainable Development
than good stewardship of natural resources.[2]
Put that all together and it equals what we so-called conspiracy theorists
have been saying all along: this is a plan to control every aspect of our
lives, economic, environmental, spiritual, educational, reproduction.
The state will not only be in our pocketbooks
and our bedrooms, but in our schools and churches. They will decide what
foods we can eat (food-sheds), if we can have children, how much education
each child will be allowed, how much space we can inhabit, and what we will
worship - Jehovah or Gaia or something else entirely.
So how is Al Gores wrenching transformation going to transpire?
There are five paths being used to transform America from the land of the
brave to the pen of the slave, they are:
-
For the rural areas its the Wildlands
Project.
-
For the cities its smart growth.
-
In business its Public/Private
Partnerships.
-
In government its called stakeholder
councils and non-elected boards and regional government - or
reinvented government.
-
And in the schools it is called No Child
Left Behind.
Wildlands Project
Dave Foreman, formerly of the Wilderness Society and the Nature Conservancy,
first dreamed up Earth First!, the club of eco-terrorists, then decided to
play grown up and along with Arne Naess (Norwegian deep-ecologist), drew
up the plans to re-wild North America. I say that he was playing at being
grown up because no sane, reasoning person would want to take civilization
back to a primitive stage.
The
Wildlands Project literally calls for the re-wilding of 50% of all the
land in every state - back to the way it was before Christopher Columbus set
foot on this land.
In 1983, when Foreman first dreamed up the scheme for the Wildlands Project,
he said:
It is not enough to preserve the roadless, undeveloped country
remaining. We must re-create wilderness in large regions: move out the cars
and civilized people, dismantle the roads and dams, reclaim the plowed lands
and clearcuts - reintroduce extirpated species.
In order to re-wild America, the people must go somewhere else.
They must be
driven from their farms and rural homes (and even cabins) and crammed into
cities, in Newspeak, human settlements. Human settlements is a much more
descriptive word for the globalists plans than cities, as cities as we know
them will be mutated into holding areas for great numbers of human beings
(see Smart Growth below.)
The Wildlands Project (the product of a very disturbed mind, as I intimated
before) actually became the blueprint for the UNs Biodiversity Treaty. So
now we have an eco-warriors sick idea of Utopia becoming the prototype for
international re-wilding of the world and it has the power of law.
And what kind of person gleefully says,
Isnt the only hope for the planet
that the industrial nations collapse? Isnt it our responsibility to bring
that about?
That was Maurice Strong basically praising Foremans folly at
the Earth Summit.
Smart Growth
Second path to Sustainable Development
The second path to Sustainable Development is Smart Growth.
According to the Wildlands map, certain areas
have been designated as human habitat areas; those are the larger cities of
our country. You might want to look human habitat areas this way: it is
rather like at a zoo. Creatures are penned and other creatures are free to
roam and look at the penned creatures; this time it will be humans in the
pens and the animals having the run of the country.
There are many ways in which the globalists are achieving this scenario. One
was
the U.S. Conference of Mayors in San Francisco.
On June 5 (World
Environment Day), 2005, two documents - the "Green Cities Declaration" and
the "Urban Environmental Accords" - were presented. Every mayor in attendance signed them. The two
documents are part and parcel of the United Nations Agenda 21.
The first is
the declaration that the mayors of all the cities of the United States and
the world are going to be the implementers of Agenda 21.
The second explains how it will be implemented,
closing with the statement,
The goal is for cities to pick three
actions to adopt each year.
Smart Growth cities have stack-em and pack-em
housing often connected to public transportation; there will be no garages
or parking lots other than for bicycles. Yes, I said connected.
Often a train line comes right under the
building. You can see examples of this in Seattle, Portland, Oregon and San
Francisco. We once thought that living near a freeway or railroad was
undesirable.
I still do, but it is in the plans for all of
our futures - railroads that is, freeways must go the way of the dinosaur
because in Newspeak,
think elevator not automobile when you
think of transportation to work.
That is, you will be riding the elevator up from
your living quarters to your work in the dream (nightmare) world of
Sustainable Development.
All this seems overwhelming and you want to holler, stop, enough.
Regretfully there is more.
Footnotes
1. Simon, Julian, The Ultimate Resource,
Princeton University Press, 1981. p. 45.
Environmental, resource, and
population stresses are diminishing, and with the passage of time will
have less influence than now upon the quality of human life on our
planet. These stresses have in the past always caused many people to
suffer from lack of food, shelter, health, and jobs, but the trends is
toward less rather than more of such suffering... Because of
increases in knowledge, the earths carrying capacity has been
increasing throughout the decades and centuries and millennia to such an
extent that the term carrying capacity has by now no useful meaning.

PART 3
February 25, 2012
Overview
When public policy is made by elected
officials who are accountable to the people who are governed, then
government is truly empowered by the consent of the governed.
Sustainable development has designed a
process through which public policy is designed by professionals and
bureaucrats, and implemented administratively, with only symbolic, if
any, participation by elected officials.
The professionals and bureaucrats who
actually make the policies are not accountable to the people who are
governed by them.
Henry Lamb
Sovereignty International
Public Private
Partnerships
Third path to Sustainable Development
The third path to
Sustainable Development, is Public/Private Partnerships.
PPPs are business ventures that are undertaken
with a partnership between the government (public sector) and private
business entities.
The businesses promise the government that they will
operate under the laws of sustainable development and the government then
acts as a bullying big brother to the businesses and forces onerous rules
and regulations on those who wont play the PPP game; this tactic often
results in putting the competition out of business while the PPPs get more
powerful - thanks to Congress.
We are bombarded constantly by the PPPs messages of going green with their
products from toilets (that often take several flushes thus negating their
claim to use less water) to wind power, to building materials.
Are all of
these products really better for us and the environment? What about the new,
green light bulbs?
GE used their partnership with government to ban their own product - the
incandescent light bulb and replace it with the new green bulbs. Soon we
wont be allowed to buy incandescent bulbs.
Why? Because GE can make three times as much
from the new ones as they are more expensive.
But they are less green than
fuel oil. They come with instructions on how to deal with them if they break
- dont touch with your hands, you could absorb some of the mercury; dont
vacuum, the mercury vapor could be released into the air and you or your
children could breathe it causing great harm, etc.
It is a miracle they dont require wearing a
Hazmat suit when cleaning one up. Nevertheless they are considered green
because the government decreed them to be because their manufacturer is a
PPP and thus only produces green items.
And now there is a new kind of corporation being developed through Public
Private Partnerships - its called benefit corporations.
As Michael Shaw of Freedom Advocates describes it,
imagine a legislated brotherhood of
business where favored businesses get to go to the front of the line for
permits, licenses and opportunities merely because they agree to advance
the principles of Sustainable Development and Agenda 21.
Five states already have Benefit Corporation legislation:
-
Hawaii
-
Virginia
-
Maryland
-
Vermont
-
New Jersey
And six more are in the process of making it
part of their states corporate legal system, including California,
Colorado, Michigan, New York, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.
Stakeholder Councils
Fourth path to Sustainable Development
The fourth path to Sustainable Development is called Stakeholder Councils.
In our local governments - city and county - an
unelected, self-selected group of people are steadily taking over the
control of planning and then running the government. Who are these unelected
people? First there are the employees of the NGOs (Non-governmental
organizations affiliated with the UN) that were working on a visioning plan
or another regional planning scheme in the area (see regionalism coming in
subsequent article).
The Council usually will be composed of several
of these NGO workers and one or two globalist-leaning, leading members of
the community.
How do these Councils take control?
They usually come into town to help run the
process of a visioning plan link or other program designed to regionalize
the area. Once they have completed the plan, if they like that area of the
country, they stick around to take over and become unelected officials who
have no allegiance to the community and no accountability to the electorate
while the locally elected, and thus legitimate, office holders are reduced
to being rubber stamps for the Councils decrees.
There will not be just one Stakeholder Council, there will be numerous ones,
all overlapping other Stakeholder Councils (again see regionalism in
subsequent article).
The best way I can describe this is like when
you make something out of paper mache, you overlap a piece on top of another
and another until you have completed your piece of art. In this case it is
not art but totalitarian control of the country. Each of these Councils will
be autonomous in their sphere. And none of them will be beholding to the
citizenry.
Let me give you an example from here in Knoxville. We are being sold on
planET (plan East Tennessee), also called Five Counties, One Vision.
The areas of our lives that will be controlled
by this stakeholder council will be transportation, housing, economic
development/jobs, environment and community health. Think about it, a group
of people who have very different views on what is needed vis a vis these
areas of our lives is going to be controlling every aspect of housing, the
environment and transportation.
Here is the UNs Conference on Sustainable
Developments description
of what defines good jobs,
...green and decent jobs defines these as
positions across all sectors that contribute to greening, preserving or
restoring the quality of the environment, promoting social inclusion and
aiding in a transition to a low-carbon economy.
Those are necessary factors in jobs for the
future in America; if a job doesnt fit all those qualifications then it
must be phased out.
And let me tell you what they mean by community health.
Have you heard of
Gross National Happiness? No? Well you better learn about it now, it is
going to replace Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the measurement of our
national well-being. I said replace not complement.
Here are The Four Pillars of GNH:
-
the promotion of equitable and
sustainable socio-economic development
-
the preservation and promotion of
cultural values
-
the conservation of the natural
environment
-
the establishment of good governance
By now you should be able to figure out what
most of that Newspeak means to us normal people.
Equitable and sustainable socio-economic
development means to take us back from industrialized society to a meaner,
more primitive one thus we are all poor together struggling with survival.
You can bet the cultural values being promoted are not those of Western
Culture and Judeo-Christian values.
The so-called conservation of the natural
environment is actually the preservation of pre-Columbian environment and
the establishment of good governance is global government.
Education
Fifth path to Sustainable Development
The fifth path to Sustainable Development is education.
Perhaps I should have made it the first, but one
needs to know what the goal is to understand what is happening in our
schools - or a better term is retraining facilities. Our children are no
longer being educated or taught as we think of education - reading, math,
science, history.
To cut to the chase, let me quote from the
introduction to Charlotte Iserbyts
The Deliberate Dumbing Down of
America,
Iserbyt has also documented the gradual
transformation of our once academically successful education system into
one devoted to training children to become compliant human resources to
be used by government and industry for their own purposes.
This is how
fascist-socialist societies train their children to become servants of
their government masters.
The successful implementation of this new
philosophy of education will spell the end of the American dream of
individual freedom and opportunity. The government will plan your life
for you, and unless you comply with government restrictions and
regulations your ability to pursue a career of your own choice will be
severely limited.
Our children are being programmed to be good
global citizens, to believe in social justice instead of equal justice thus
to sublimate themselves to the common good.
Their values, attitudes and beliefs are being
altered to make them viable citizens of a serfdom with earth worshipping as
their religion.
Again from the intro to DDDoA,
Americans forget that the present
government education system started as a Prussian import in the
1840s-50s. It was a system built on Hegels belief that the state was
God walking on earth.
The only way to restore educational freedom,
and put education back into the hands of parents where it belongs, is to
get the federal government, with its coercive policies, out of
education.
The billions of dollars being spent by the
federal government to destroy educational freedom must be halted, and
that can only be done by getting American legislators to understand that
the American people want to remain a free people, in charge of their own
lives and the education of their children.
You know how the globalists are effecting the
so-called education of our children, but how are they effecting the
transformation from a Republic (the greatest one the world has ever known)
to a Regionalized slave state?
Through the International Council for Local
Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) and the American Planning Association (APA)
and a myriad of other 'programs' to achieve the same goals (Green Cities, Cool
Mayors, Urban Environmental Accords, etc).
This is a lot to grasp, but you must realize that it is but a drop in the
bucket of what is being done under the guise of protecting the environment.
As I put it at the beginning of this piece, back in part One, Agenda
21/Sustainable Development is the end of civilization as we know it. It is
the end of private property, the elevation of the collective over the
individual. It is the redistribution of Americas wealth to the global
elite, it is the end of the Great American Experiment and the Constitution.
And, it is the reduction of 85% of the worlds
