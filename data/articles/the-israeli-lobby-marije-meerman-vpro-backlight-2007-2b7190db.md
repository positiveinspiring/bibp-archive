Is one allowed to question that reality, or is the pro-Israel lobby so
strong, financially and politically, that the relationship with Israel is
taboo and therefore unmentionable?
-
And what happens to those who dare expose
the unmentionable?
In March 2006 the American political scientists
John Mearsheimer (University of Chicago) and Steve Walt (Harvard) published the
controversial article 'The Israel Lobby and US foreign policy'.
In it they
state that it is not, or no longer, expedient for the US to support and
protect present-day Israel. Together with the power shifts in Congress and
the increasing doubts about the current Middle-East policy, this could
become the fuse in the powder keg.
Backlight talks to the people concerned
in this 'new realism' debate. The documentary sheds light on both parties
involved in the discussion: those who wish to maintain the strong tie
between the US and Israel (Neocon Richard Perle, the Lebanese Christian
Brigitte Gabriel and evangelist John Hagee, the lobby club
AIPAC), and those
who were critical of it and not infrequently became 'victims' of the lobby.
Member of Congress Earl Hilliard from Alabama advocated a rapprochement with
the Arab world and was promptly ousted by a political adversary who had the
support of Aipac money.
The historian Tony Judt, who tried to maintain that Israel was becoming a
belligerent and intolerant ethno-state, driven by religion, found a lecture
canceled at the last minute.
And the Human Rights Watch Director Kenneth
Roth was personally attacked after he had criticized the violence Israel had
used in the mini-war against Lebanon last summer.
Finally the question
arises in how far the pro-Israel lobby ultimately determines the military
and political importance of Israel itself.
Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson (Colin
Powell's ex chief-of-staff) explains in how far the lobby's influence
affects the decision-making structure in the White House. Member of Congress
and Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich is asked in how far
today's politicians can stay out of reach of the long arm of the pro-Israel
lobby.
The lobby, Congress, the White House and Israel itself seem to have
ended up in a suffocating embrace: will it ever change and how could it?
For many years now the American foreign policy has been characterized by the
strong tie between the United States and Israel.
