Debt-serfdom and the dominance of Financial Power are two sides of the same
coin.
Let's be clear about three
things:
-
Too Big to Fail
financialization is the metastasizing cancer that has crippled
democracy and capitalism.
-
Financialization
feeds on expanding debt and cannot survive without it.
-
Debt is serfdom.
I have covered this in depth
for years:

The Road to Debt-Serfdom (January
25, 2013)
There are three key dynamics
to debt-serfdom:
-
The serf is never
free of debt, i.e. he/she is programmed to being indebted for
life.
-
Most of the serf's
income is devoted to servicing debt.
-
Most of the debt is
unproductive: marginal-utility college education, needless auto
loan, leveraged McMansion that loses value in the inevitable
speculative bust, and so on.
There are many ways to state
these fundamentals and shelf-loads of books have been written to describe
the many mechanisms of financialization and serfdom, but we can
summarize the dynamics in a few additional points:
This leads to an inescapable
conclusion: the only way to kill the metastasizing cancer of
financialization is to "starve the Beast" of debt. This is akin to
starving a tumor by cutting off its blood supply - in the case of
financialization, that means reducing debt to a trickle.
With democracy crippled by
an ever-rising tide of dirty money, the only way to destroy the Death
Star (the Fed and the Too Big to Fail/Prosecute/Control banks) is
to stop borrowing.
Pleading with the President
or Congress is like asking a cancer to please stop growing. Don't waste
your breath. Talking isn't going to fix anything.
The only way to restore
democracy is to cut off the blood flow of the financializing cancer,
i.e. cut off debt. We have been programmed to view debt as necessary as
air - it is impossible to go to college, start a business, own a vehicle
or buy a house without massive debt.
It is not ordained that any
of these requires a lifetime of debt. Our acceptance of debt is a
programmed but still voluntary acceptance of serfdom.
It is possible to earn
a university degree without going into debt, but it requires embracing
an entirely unconventional approach based on sustained, goal-oriented
frugality, thrift and outside-the-box thinking.
If an entrepreneur
absolutely needs $20,000 to start his/her enterprise, then raise the
money via crowd-sourcing.
If you must borrow money,
only do so if you have a credible plan to pay it all off in the first
year. If you cannot expect to do so, then your proposed enterprise
simply isn't profitable enough to invest in.
If you must borrow money to
buy a used vehicle, then put down $5,000 in cash and pay off the $5,000
balance within a year. Get a loan from a local credit union rather than
from a TBTF bank.
If you must buy a house,
then go in with others and buy a multi-unit building or a McMansion that
can be shared, and only buy if you can pay off the entire mortgage with
your current income in 3-5 years.
We cannot expect to control
the vast derivatives trade in credit default swaps and synthetic
collateral, but we can remove the real-world collateral of debt from the
leveraging machine. With few mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc.
to securitize and leverage, the Financialization cancer will slowly die
of starvation.
Once its ability to spread is halted and its profits
plummet, its political clout will decline in equal measure.
Though it would dearly love
to, the State cannot force anyone to take on debt except as
taxpayers. We do not have to remain debt-serfs, nor accept our servitude
as unavoidable or fated.
Debt = serfdom. There is
another way to live, frugally, with only short-term debts that are paid
off in a few short years. We either accept the consumerist-narcissist
debt-serf programming or reject it. We are neither victims nor
bystanders.
The choice is ours.
A MARKET CLEARING EVENT
The Global End Game - Part
II
CHS and Gordon T.
Long discuss the cycle of deflation
and the endgame of
leverage, credit and phantom collateral:
Things are falling apart - that is obvious.
But why are they falling
apart?
The reasons are complex and global. Our economy and society have
structural problems that cannot be solved by adding debt to debt. We are
becoming poorer, not just from financial over-reach, but from
fundamental forces that are not easy to identify or understand.
We will
cover the five core reasons why things are falling apart:
-
Debt and financialization
-
Crony capitalism and the elimination of accountability
-
Diminishing returns
-
Centralization
-
Technological, financial and demographic changes in our economy
Complex systems weakened by diminishing returns collapse under their own
weight and are replaced by systems that are simpler, faster and
affordable.
If we cling to the old ways, our system will disintegrate.
If we want sustainable prosperity rather than collapse, we must embrace
a new model that is,
-
Decentralized
-
Adaptive
-
Transparent
-
Accountable (DATA)
We are not powerless.
Not accepting responsibility and being powerless
are two sides of the same coin: once we accept responsibility, we become
powerful.
