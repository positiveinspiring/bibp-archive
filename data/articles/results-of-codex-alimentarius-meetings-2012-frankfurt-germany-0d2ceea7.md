Codex Alimentarius is One Big Football Game
Codex Alimentarius is a
United Nations-sponsored concept and
organization, which - under the auspices of the World Health Organization
(WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) - creates food
standards and guidelines used in international trade.
In 1994, the World Trade Organization (WTO)
replaced the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) with actual
trade-sanction power to enforce Codex and other standards and
guidelines.
Not surprisingly, Codex took on an entirely new
importance.
Now nearly 300 of us - Country delegates and International Non-governmental
Organizations (INGOs)
- were involved in Germany this December in a playoff where inches of dry
but crucial script would gain the yardage of victory or bitter defeat.
This was the 34th session of the
Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses (CCNFSDU),
alias Malnutrition Meeting, in frigid Bad Soden, Germany the first week of
December 2012, where the National Health Federation sought to make its own
gains and preserve our health freedoms.
In this innocuous meeting room at the Ramada Inn, play by play, line
by line, either the ball is moving forward, backward, or its being passed
or kicked into oblivion without regard to any real goal in a
last-ditch effort to get rid of it before being tackled.
In this case, for the majority of the
represented World, tackled was a voluntary fumble,
When is it break time? Lets just agree
with the provided wording and get a cup of coffee.
You have to realize the World doesnt often
enjoy what the United States takes completely for granted, in this case,
safe, high-quality supplements in abundance.
In a worst case scenario, Codex is rigged and we merely delay the inevitable
passage of their ultimate will. It takes a skillful operator - in this case
Dr. Pia Noble (what a misnomer
) - who can lead the room and in clearly
balanced opposition somehow convince or cow the country delegates into
believing there is actually consensus.
Thats how Codex operates: by consensus. We
dont vote unless pushed.
The World must agree, must cooperate
however,
what I witnessed at this session of the CCNFSDU was clearly, in legal terms,
leading and manipulating the room to the wishes of three strong forces:
At Codex Alimentarius (Latin for Food Code),
the plays are read, line by line, and debated on by a World that doesnt
necessarily even accept certain principles in their daily life - like taking
supplements.
As a Nutritional Therapist, this was my meeting.
I had to be there. Thankfully a few staunch supporters made sure that
happened.
In the case of this particular Codex meeting held in Bad Soden, the ball was
in jeopardy of being punted into oblivion when we hit the discussion of
Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs).
Was there anyone out of the nearly 300 delegates
who really cared at all about the issues that will impact you when you go to
the health-food store this coming year?
This was my second Codex meeting and I could see
clearly that the paragraphs dedicated to the discussion of our NRVs were in
danger of being accepted as written and set into stone around the World, all
in favor of just getting to the coffee break, and I mean that literally.
You have to understand, United States citizens enjoy unprecedented access to
supplements with values that actually have the power to prevent disease or
heal ill health - the rest of the World either does not use supplements,
believing they are toxic - like drugs - or the nutrient reference values
(RDAs) are so low that multiple bottles would have to be purchased at great
expense to create the impact that one good U.S. bottle creates, or they
simply dont have them because no one could afford them when their
healthcare system provides free drugs as an alternative.
I saw the low reference values firsthand in Germany.
We went into a health-food store and I could
hardly find the vitamin/mineral section. I had to ask. When I did find the
one small shelf, the highest values for Vitamin D3 were 400 IUs. I take
25,000 IUs daily
talk about breaking the bank.
No wonder the World, represented in the form of
country delegates, was anxious to get to the free coffee, sweet rolls, etc.
at the break. Their countries cannot afford what seems to them to be
nonsense, so they mentally have moved on and disregarded any
pro-vitamin/mineral argument.
This is not their World. In fact, if the
National Health Federation were not present at this crucial meeting on
setting Nutrient Reference Values, I can guarantee you that your World would
never be the same again.
Once lowered, do you really think NRVs would
ever stand the chance of somehow going through Codexs 8-step process to
rise again? From a Nutritional Therapists standpoint, several of the
nutrients that were placed on Codexs sacrificial altar were methylation
factors. B6, B12, Folic Acid
If we dont methylate well, we can develop
opportunistic diseases. Cancer
heart attack that occurs when Homocysteine
elevates
Some, like calcium, which Codex wished to
elevate out of proportion to stabilizing magnesium, and when taken out of
balance, creates disease as well by mineralizing in soft tissue like blood
vessels instead of the bone and teeth.
So, at this point Im thinking,
Is Codex out to kill us?
So many of the final decisions made by Codex
equal ill health for the World.
It means both
Big Pharma and the so-called health care
system profits, while we grow ill and die. It is no secret that depopulation
is one aspect of the Worlds agenda.
Dr.
Henry
Kissinger himself wrote:
Depopulation should be the highest priority
of U.S. foreign policy towards the Third World.
Apparently America is the new third World.
If you ever needed an advocate for your health and your health freedom, it
is now. Now is the time to have your wishes and your Voice represented at
Codex. Is it any wonder that Codex is not letting any more health-freedom
organizations into the elite representation?
The National Health Federation (NHF) is the ONLY
health-freedom organization that has the power to speak out and, believe me,
we do and we have - frequently. We have also submitted comments to the
Electronic Working Groups that often meet in cyberspace before the meetings,
and we also have the power to propose correction of the final report.
Do you know how many delegates stick around for
the tedious, line-by-line reading of the final report?
Many are long gone, mistakenly trusting that the
work they performed for the World will actually be represented accurately in
the final report. NHF stays
to the bitter end. Hours of rehashing what we
have spent the week working toward, defending our documented statements,
defending the truth that too-often gets somehow skewed, omitted, or somehow
rendered opaque.
NHF came to this meeting to promote and defend healthier Nutrient
Reference Values.
The attack by Australia and others on these
particular NRVs, from my professional standpoint, is designed to take out a
large number of the population at least in the U.S. where we have access to
supplements with values that are currently at least approaching sufficiency
and where we have the incomes generally to support their purchase.
What was so incredibly ironic about this meeting was the emphasis on
malnutrition in the World. It actually sparked a growing interest in me
about the integrity of infant formulas.
They are including transfats and contaminants in
infant formula! When we learn that in France, for example, breast feeding is
neither popular nor widely practiced, it pays to defend the integrity of
infant formulas!
But the trajectory of the morning - 3 hours
before NRVs were even approached - was on growing up milk, which
Elizabeth Streken (an INGO representative of the International Baby
Formula Action Network) said was a market ploy to get mothers to feel guilty
if they didnt keep bottle feeding babies way past time
At any rate, the discrepancy and complete
disconnect in regards to the NRVs was that supposedly Codex was there to
prevent malnutrition in the World, yet here they were, the very last ones in
favor of optimal nutrition for infants.
Instead, Codex was lowering our already
malnutrition-promoting, low NRVs, which are set to prevent the very
last-ditch disease processes before death instead of promoting optimum
nutrition and vibrant, disease-resistant health.
So, these two themes predominated:
(1) Get through the tedious drivel and get
me to the coffee and donut cart
(2) The incongruous "Yes, we are all for
stopping malnutrition
lets lower the values in the supplements, shall
we?
And then let us not forget the overarching theme
by Mme. Chair - not so terribly Noble, Pia - What I Decide, Will Be.
The National Health Federation has been in existence long before any other
health-freedom organization was even a gleam in the fathers eye. We are
the granddaddy of them all. Weve employed a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.
for more than 50 years. We alone hold the distinction of being the only
health-freedom organization able to speak at Codex.
So, do you see now how important this ability
is?
Not only can we speak; but, as mentioned above,
we can submit written comments and arguments - and we did, three times - on
the NRV issue alone prior to the meeting in Germany (twice as part of the
electronic working group hosted by the ultimate opposition: Australia, and
once directly to the Committee).
Do I feel fortunate to be on the team of the most powerful health-freedom
organization at Codex? I feel incredibly humbled. For one who had little
political interest or influence in the past, I am now thrust into the heart
of the action where policy is set for the World.
It is not only quite humbling but it carries an
enormous responsibility to carry the wishes and desires of those whom NHF
speaks for and represents to the seat of power. And we do so faithfully time
and again.
The lives that are impacted are not only our own but those of our children
and grandchildren. Our familys health is at stake. In the final analysis,
if we lose our health, we have lost. It is all we have besides the faith
that sustains us and keeps us seeking the path of Light in the growing
darkness of the World.
The Codex meeting on nutrition was anything but.
It was about some elite marketers seeking to
manipulate the World - guilting them into keeping children on formulas when
they needed to embrace a solid diet - real growing up food. It was about
government regulators lowering key nutrients and raising others that would
ensure that our health would deteriorate.
It masqueraded in the guise of compassion and
the oft-said mantra consumer protection, yet all the while was undermining
our health by chipping away at the very foundations in the name of control
and ill health.
We at NHF spoke for you. At the end of the day, I approached the dais where
Dr. Pia Noble held court. I asked her for 5 minutes at the next
meeting to explain the science behind our commitment to NRVs. She grimaced,
rolled her eyes, disregarded me completely in the most disrespectful way
possible for one woman to address another, and then deferred to the
Secretariat.
The answer was - you guessed it - NO.
It might create further discussion
.
Codex is a body that is supposed to elevate your
health, not suppress it.
But who speaks for you there?
The National Health Federation. Thats the real
WHO.

to underwrite expenses to future Codex Alimentarius meetings like the one
upcoming in March 2013 in Beijing where the topic of contaminants will be
reviewed.
My personal passion is focusing on contaminants
in infant formulas, as well as aspartame and aluminum in our food supply. We
really cannot fight this fight without every one of you pitching in and
doing your part.
Believe me, its so satisfying to know we really
ARE making an impact on this World for the benefit of future generations.
Codex Nutrition Committee Chooses...
Malnutrition

In a stunning display of
nutritional ignorance,
three women ram through a Codex
standard that
leaves many with sub-optimal nutrition
Scott Tips discusses
NRVs with
Malaysian and Benin delegates
at CCNFSDU Meeting
The Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses (CCNFSDU)
just finished meeting all last week (December 3-7) in Bad Soden, a small
German city near Frankfurt am Main.
Nearly 300 delegates were in attendance,
comprised of government functionaries and international non-governmental
organizations (INGOs) representatives. So, for one week, the assembled
delegates - including the INGO delegation of the National Health Federation
(NHF) 1 - met, discussed, and debated a wide number of food and
food-supplement issues, including the controversial draft Nutrient
Reference Values (NRVs) for vitamins and minerals.
Remember, the food guidelines and standards adopted by this Committee, and
approved by the
Codex Alimentarius Commission, are important because they are then used
domestically by numerous countries worldwide and by virtually all countries
in international food trade.
Nutrient Reference
Values
Those who have been following the National Health Federations efforts at
Codex since the mid-1990s will recall that at the Codex Nutrition Committee
meeting in Dusseldorf, Germany in 2009, the NHF singlehandedly launched the
opposition that stopped the Australian delegation and others from dumbing
down these Nutrient Reference Values.2
Australia and its supporters had wrongly proposed that lower NRVs be adopted
for certain important vitamins and minerals, including Vitamin C.
For example, the Proposed Draft Additional or
Revised NRVs for Labeling Purposes in the Codex Guidelines on Nutrition
Labeling suggested reducing the,
-
Vitamin A NRV from 800 micrograms down
to 550 micrograms
-
Vitamin C down from an
already-abysmally-low 60 milligrams to 45 milligrams
-
Thiamin down from 1.4 milligrams to 1.2
milligrams
-
Niacin from 18 milligrams down to 15
milligrams
-
Magnesium down from 300 milligrams to
240 milligrams,
...and so forth.3
These values are already at subsistence levels, and most consumers need far
more than the miserable amounts that Codex would parsimoniously dole out to
them in order to enjoy optimal and robust health.
Yet Australia and its supporters are so fixated
on reducing the values even more that they have blinded themselves to the
real science showing the absolute need for more nutrient intake, not less.
Fortunately, thanks to NHF and its key supporters India and Iraq at the 2009
meeting, the Committee wisely chose not to move forward with any of those
proposed NRVs and instead held the work back for further review and study.
Three years have passed since we first stopped
these NRVs from being adopted, and each year of non-adoption has been a
victory for NHF, and for you.
The Electronic Working
Group
Last year, the Committee created an electronic Working Group (eWG) -
chaired by ever-present Australia - to look at the hard numbers for each of
the vitamins and minerals under consideration.
NHF was a member of that group along with twenty
other delegations. Working through e-mails, the Australian-led eWG gradually
prepared a report; and the NHF and other delegations submitted comments
throughout 2012, to be included in that report.
Unfortunately, the United States seemed to have had more of Australias ear
than anyone else; and the eWG accordingly submitted to this years Committee
a Final Report (over NHFs objections) that essentially split the vitamins
and minerals into two groups:
One that the eWG (read here, Australia and
the United States) considered suitable for adoption; and a second
group that was considered unsuitable and would need further work.4
Strangely enough, this was exactly the approach
pushed by the United States at the 2010 CCNFSDU meeting held in Santiago,
Chile, but which NHF, the European Union, and others had opposed and
defeated back then.
Resurrected from its vampire grave just in time
for this 2012 meeting, this plan found support with both Australia and the
United States working hard to ensure that, this time, at least half of the
dumbed-down nutrient values could be pushed forward towards adoption.
The 2012 Meeting
As planned, the Committee once again took up discussion of the appropriate
NRVs for Codex to adopt, using the eWG Report as its starting point.
Of course, the Committee covered other topics,
such as draft guidelines on the addition of essential nutrients to foods and
formulated supplementary foods for older infants and children. The latter
was as hotly-debated a topic as the NRVs.
The Chairwoman was once again Dr. Pia Noble, appointed by the German
Health Ministry. My fellow NHF delegate, Katherine Carroll, spent time
during a break speaking with Dr. Noble to make sure that NHF was visible
enough so that there would not be a repeat of last years deliberate refusal
by the Chairwoman to recognize NHF so we could speak out on the
saturated-fats issue.
By the end of the meeting it was clear that Ms.
Carroll had been successful as NHF was always recognized by the Chairwoman
when it requested the floor to speak.
Still, Dr. Noble is popular with some of the
delegates because, as they put it,
she moves things along.
Well, moving things along - like Fly Me To
The Moon - has become something of a theme song for this Codex Committee.
Real nutritional science is trampled into the
mud as the Committee rushes pell-mell to adopt guidelines and standards
without considering the consequences of what it is doing. Unfortunately only
a few delegates realize what is happening, the majority are content to drift
along in concert with and at the direction of the few leaders.
On the second day of the meeting, just before the lunch break, the
Australian delegate, Janine Lewis, read through her eWG Final Report
while we all listened. I knew what was coming because I had spoken with her
before the meeting had started, asking her to, at the very least, withhold
calcium from her suitable list of nutrients that she would advance for
adoption.5
When she asked and heard in response that I had
only spoken with her and the U.S. delegate about that, her position visibly
hardened and she told me simply,
Lets see what the Committee does.
It became obvious soon enough what the Committee
would do, as I pushed the button on my microphone to speak when the meeting
resumed after the lunch break.
As in 2009, I was the second person to speak!
This is highly unusual since the Codex procedure
is to let all of the country delegations speak first, and only then allow
the INGOs to speak. Being second meant that there were few who wanted to
speak out on this issue.
Barbara Schneeman, the U.S. delegate, had spoken immediately before
me and said the U.S. liked these [NRV] figures and thus liked the idea of
advancing the suitable nutrients 6 to the Commission for
adoption.
With that, my microphone illuminated red and it
was my turn to speak.
I told the Committee that, except for calcium
(whose value had been increased while magnesiums had been decreased, the
exact opposite of what should happen with these twin minerals), the
Australian figures were all too low, that the NRVs were being reduced by
anywhere from 15% to 25%, and questioned why Australia was always choosing
the lowest values it could find, even lower than what the guidelines would
call for.
The safety of vitamins and minerals, I argued,
was unparalleled, so that there could be no problem with having higher
levels of these nutrients.
Moreover, lowering the NRVs was inconsistent
with Codexs announced goal of preventing malnutrition.
Scott Tips conferring with
Malaysian delegate Nagen on
the Saturated-Fats issue
The International Alliance of Dietary Food Supplements Associations (IADSA)
and the International Dairy Federation (IDF) spoke up after NHF, both
attacking the proposed values of a specific nutrient - IADSA advocating a
higher value for Biotin and IDF a lower value for Calcium (because the
higher value would mean that milk could no longer be considered a rich
source of calcium).
The Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN),
to the confusion of many, simply said,
We would like to stress the scientific
underpinnings of these numbers.
Did that mean they supported the values, or
opposed them?
It sounded more like the former, but we could
not tell.
As expected, Australia responded in defense of the dumbed-down NRVs; and NHF
then challenged those numbers yet again. But this time, the Malaysian,
Iranian, and South African delegates spoke up one right after another in
strong support of NHF and in favor of more sensible NRVs. It was heartening
to hear these three women speak out for sensible nutrition based upon real
science.7
NHF and IADSA spoke up again, respectively opposing the adoption of any of
these values and, in the case of IADSA, the Biotin value.
The European Union (EU) delegate, Basil
Mathioudakis, quite sensibly asked the Chairwoman what logic did it make
to advance some and not all of the NRVs at the same time.
Switzerland disagreed with the EU, but NHF spoke
up in support of the EUs question and suggested that the so-called
suitable NRVs be held back, or at the very least some of the more
questionable ones such as Calcium and Vitamin K.
IADSA, in turn, pointed out that the Committee
was going against its own guidelines by not selecting the proper value, a
higher value, for Biotin.
But the Chairwoman, Pia Noble, was having none of that and insisted
that these suitable NRVs were going forward despite the substantial
opposition. In a last-ditch effort, I asked the Chairwoman to at least move
the Vitamin K, Biotin, and Calcium from the suitable Table to the
unsuitable category.
Not only was the answer no, but Dr. Noble
decided that since opposition might grow against these so-called suitable
NRVs, then they should be advanced along the path of adoption as quickly as
possible.
So, she unilaterally undertook to advance them
along the 8-Step adoption process to Step 5/8, where they now hover on the
edge of full adoption by the Commission itself next year.
As an added insult, the following day, the Committee discussed another
Agenda Item, that is, revisions to the Codex General Principles for the
Addition of Essential Nutrients to Foods, which in small but important part
dealt with the question of whether Codex should or could state that
nutrients can prevent or reduce the risk of disease.
Amazingly enough, many delegations spoke out
against such language.
Only the U.S. delegation and two INGOs (NHF and
GAIN) defended this statement.
NHF and Benin discuss the NRVs
Post-Script
The Troika of,
-
Pia Noble
-
Janine Lewis
-
Barbara Schneeman,
...succeeded in finally pushing forward eleven
of the nineteen vitamins and minerals further along the road to adoption.
At the Codex Alimentarius Commission meeting
next July there will be a further push to adopt these eleven vitamins and
minerals and set their low (except for Calcium) values in stone.
Barbara Schneeman, the U.S. delegate, will not
be there as her retirement was announced at the CCNFSDU meeting.
Fortunately, there is still an opportunity to derail this effort to
steam-roller consumers into ill-health and NHF intends to make the most of
it.
In addition, the Chairwoman reauthorized the eWG to continue its work on the
unsuitable nutrient values and the NHF is taking an active part in that
working groups activities.
The eWG will report back to the CCNFSDU when it
meets again next Fall in Germany.
Legacy
Barbara Schneemans legacy at Codex has been an unfortunate one of pushing
big corporate interests while thumbing her nose at consumers.
Whether it was her obstinate opposition to
adopting a guideline for labeling GMO foods (at the Codex Committee on Food
Labeling) or her questionable support for dumbing-down NRVs (at CCNFSDU),
she has unfortunately been too often on the wrong side of the issues.
Perhaps, in the interests of better health for consumers worldwide, her
retirement from Codex could have happened a few years earlier.
While this might sound uncharitable, inflicting
ill-health upon billions of humans is far less charitable still.
Final Thoughts
The Troika has cleverly pushed forward some of the nutrient NRVs in the hope
that the others must inevitably follow along.
Whatever their agenda might truly be, the sad
fact is that consumer health will suffer from their thoughtless and
stercoraceous actions.
The problem facing consumers is not vitamin-and-mineral toxicity, it is
widespread deficiencies of those nutrients. Too many Codex delegates are
stuck in the mindset that human populations only need bare subsistence
nutrition; that is, that nutrition that merely keeps them breathing and
their feet moving one step at a time.
The concept that there is a greater level of
nutrition - of optimal nutrition - is as foreign to them as space flight
would be to Stone Age people.
They fail to comprehend that nutrients at proper
levels can actually enable individuals to function at more proficient levels
and without those diseases that afflict sub-optimally fed populations.
The disservice done to Humanity by those too lazy to think and then act
is so profound as to be disheartening to many others. Many among us question
the motivations of those who want to only push a guideline or standard
forward to final adoption simply to get it done and out of the way.
Is their thinking really as shallow as that?
Maybe we better hope it is, as that is an easier
mindset to deal with than
one of active malevolence.

[2] Not to be confused with Maximum Upper
Permitted Limits, NRVs are nothing more than souped-up RDAs. These are
numerical values assigned to specified nutrients that will supposedly
cover 98% of the populations nutritional needs for that nutrient.
By referring to the NRV for a vitamin or
mineral, the consumer is supposed to know whether he or she is getting
an adequate intake of that nutrient, even if, as in the case of Vitamin
C, 100% of the NRV is defined as 45 milligrams!
These values are claimed to be set according
to rigorous scientific evidence; but, in reality, science at
Codex levels is often nothing more than a flimsy set of assumptions and
erroneous conclusions cobbled together to justify keeping consumers
safe from dangerous vitamins and minerals.

[5] NHF has been opposed to Australias
desire to raise the Calcium NRV from 800 mg to 1000 mg for several
reasons.
First of all, it is infantile nutritional
science to think that health can be improved by raising Calcium intake
while simultaneously lowering Magnesium intake (here, from 300 mg to 240
mg!).
Magnesium and Calcium are twin minerals and
raising Calcium intake while lowering Magnesium intake is a certain
recipe for disaster, as it invites the calcium to settle into the soft
tissue like the skin and arteries and not go to where it properly
belongs, in the bones and teeth.
Secondly, by fixing the NRV for Calcium, the
Committee has limited the range in which the Committee may now set the
NRV for Magnesium. If the Committee is to follow sound nutritional
science, then the Magnesium NRV cannot now be set any lower than 500 mg.
That is a great distance from the measly 240
mg value that the Chairwoman and Australia would like to establish.

Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenate, Biotin, Calcium, and

Chairwoman to simply look the other way and advance the dumbed-down NRVs.
The three women took an unpopular stand and are true heroines, and to be
much commended for speaking out for health.
