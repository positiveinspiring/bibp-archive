The
final days of empire give ample
employment and power to the feckless, the insane and the idiotic.
These politicians and court propagandists,
hired to be the public faces on the sinking ship, mask the real work of the
crew, which is systematically robbing the passengers as the vessel goes
down. The mandarins of power stand in the wheelhouse barking ridiculous
orders and seeing how fast they can gun the engines.
They fight like children over the ships wheel
as the vessel heads full speed into a giant ice field. They wander the decks
giving pompous speeches. They shout that the SS America is the greatest ship
ever built. They insist that it has the most advanced technology and
embodies the highest virtues.
And then, with abrupt and unexpected fury, down
we will go into the frigid waters.
The last days of empire are carnivals of folly. We are in the midst of our
own, plunging forward as our leaders court willful economic and
environmental self-destruction. Sumer and Rome went down like this. So did
the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires.
Men and women of stunning mediocrity and
depravity led the monarchies of Europe and Russia on the eve of World War I.
And America has, in its own decline, offered up its share of weaklings,
dolts and morons to steer it to destruction.
A nation that was still rooted in reality would
never glorify charlatans such as,
...as they pollute the airwaves.
If we had any idea what was really happening to
us we would have turned in fury against
Barack
Obama, whose signature legacy will be utter capitulation to
the demands of,
We would have rallied behind those few, such as
Ralph Nader, who denounced a monetary system based on gambling and
the endless printing of money and condemned the willful wrecking of the
ecosystem. We would have mutinied. We would have turned the ship back.
The populations of dying empires are passive because they are
lotus-eaters.
There is a narcotic-like reverie among those
barreling toward oblivion. They retreat into the sexual, the tawdry and the
inane, retreats that are momentarily pleasurable but ensure
self-destruction. They naively trust it will all work out.
As a species,
Margaret Atwood observes in her
dystopian novel 'Oryx and Crake,'
"were doomed by hope."
And absurd promises of hope and glory are
endlessly served up by the entertainment industry, the political and
economic elite, the class of courtiers who pose as journalists, self-help
gurus like Oprah and religious belief systems that assure followers that
'God'
will always protect them.
It is collective self-delusion, a retreat into
magical thinking.
"The American citizen thus lives in a world
where fantasy is more real than reality, where the image has more
dignity than the original," Daniel J. Boorstin wrote in his book 'The
Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America.'
"We hardly dare face our bewilderment,
because our ambiguous experience is so pleasantly iridescent, and the
solace of belief in contrived reality is so thoroughly real. We have
become eager accessories in the great hoaxes of the age. These are the
hoaxes we play on ourselves."
Culture and literacy, in the final stage of
decline, are replaced with noisy diversions and empty clichés.
The Roman statesman
Cicero inveighed against their ancient
equivalent - the arena. Cicero, for his honesty, was hunted down and
murdered and his hands and head were cut off.
His severed head and his right hand, which had
written
the Philippics, were nailed onto the speakers platform in the
Forum.
The roaring crowds, while the Roman elite spat
on the head, were gleefully told he would never speak or write again. In the
modern age this toxic, mindless cacophony, our own version of spectacle and
gladiator fights, of bread and circus, is pumped into the airwaves in
24-hour cycles.
Political life has fused into celebrity worship.
Education is primarily vocational. Intellectuals are cast out and despised.
Artists cannot make a living. Few people read books.
Thought has been banished, especially at
universities and colleges, where timid pedants and careerists churn out
academic drivel.
"Although tyranny, because it needs no
consent, may successfully rule over foreign peoples," Hannah Arendt
wrote in 'The Origins of Totalitarianism,' "it can stay in power only if
it destroys first of all the national institutions of its own people."
And ours have been destroyed. Sensual pleasure
and eternal youth are our overriding obsessions.
The Roman emperor
Tiberius, at the end, fled to the
island of Capri and turned his seaside palace into a house of unbridled lust
and violence.
"Bevies of girls and young men, whom he had
collected from all over the Empire as adepts in unnatural practices, and
known as spintriae, would copulate before him in groups of three, to
excite his waning passions," Suetonius wrote in 'The Twelve Caesars.'
Tiberius trained small boys, whom he called his
minnows, to frolic with him in the water and perform oral sex. And after
watching prolonged torture, he would have captives thrown into the sea from
a cliff near his palace.
Tiberius would be followed by Caligula and Nero.
"At times when the page is turning,"
Louis-Ferdinand Céline wrote in 'Castle to Castle,' "when History brings
all the nuts together, opens its Epic Dance Halls!, hats and heads in
the whirlwind!, Panties overboard!"
The anthropologist Joseph Tainter in his
book 'The Collapse of Complex Societies' looked at the collapse of
civilizations from the Roman to the Mayan.
He concluded that they disintegrated because
they finally could not sustain the bureaucratic complexities they had
created. Layers of bureaucracy demand more and more exploitation, not only
of the environment but the laboring classes.
They become calcified by systems that are unable
to respond to the changing reality around them. They, like our elite
universities and business schools, churn out systems managers, people who
are taught not to think but to blindly service the system.
These systems managers know only how to
perpetuate themselves and the system they serve, although serving that
system means disemboweling the nation and the planet.
Our
elites and bureaucrats exhaust the earth to hold up a system that
worked in the past, failing to see that it no longer works.
Elites, rather than contemplate reform, which
would jeopardize their privilege and power, retreat in the twilight of
empire into walled compounds like the Forbidden City or Versailles. They
invent their own reality.
Those on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms
have replicated this behavior. They insist that continued reliance on fossil
fuel and speculations will sustain the empire.
State resources, as Tainter notes, are at the
end increasingly squandered on extravagant and senseless projects and
imperial adventures. And then it all collapses.
Our collapse will take the whole planet with it.
It is more pleasant, I admit, to stand mesmerized in front of our electronic
hallucinations. It is easier to check out intellectually. It is more
gratifying to imbibe the hedonism and the sickness of the worship of the
self and money. It is more comforting to chatter about celebrity gossip and
ignore or dismiss what is reality.
Thomas Mann in 'The Magic Mountain' and Joseph Roth in 'Hotel
Savoy' brilliantly chronicled this peculiar state of mind.
In Roths hotel the first three floors house in
luxury the bloated rich, the amoral politicians, the bankers and the
business owners. The upper floors are crammed with people who struggle to
pay their bills and who are steadily divested of their possessions until
they are destitute and cast out. There is no political ideology among
decayed ruling elites, despite choreographed debates and elaborate political
theater.
It is, as it always is at the end, one vast
kleptocracy.
Just before World War II, a friend asked Roth, a Jewish intellectual who had
fled Nazi Germany for Paris,
"Why are you drinking so much?" Roth
answered: "Do you think you are going to escape? You too are going to be
wiped out."
