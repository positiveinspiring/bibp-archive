Five months into the bombing campaign, it is no longer possible to believe
the initial official version of the events and the massacres attributed to
the "Gaddafi regime".
Moreover, it is now essential to take into
account Libyas legal and diplomatic rebuttal, highlighting the crimes
against peace committed by television propaganda, the war crimes perpetrated
by NATO military forces, and the crimes against humanity sponsored by
political leaders of the Atlantic Alliance.
Muammar al-Gaddafi
Just under half of Europeans still support the
war against Libya.
Their position is based on erroneous
information. They still believe, in fact, that in February the "Gaddafi
regime" crushed the protests in Benghazi with brutal force and bombed
civilian districts in Tripoli, while the Colonel himself was warning of
"rivers of blood" if his compatriots continued to challenge his authority.
During my two months investigation on the ground, I was able to verify that
these accusations were pure propaganda intoxication, designed by the NATO
powers to create the conditions for war, and relayed around the world by
their television media, in particular Al-Jazeera, CNN, BBC and France24.
However, the reader who doesnt know where he stands on this issue and who -
despite the
brainwashing of September 11 and
Saddam Husseins weapons of
mass destruction - is reluctant to accept that the United States, France,
the UK and Qatar were actually capable of fabricating such lies, will be
able to forge an opinion over time.
NATO, the largest military coalition in
history, has failed after five months of bombardments to overthrow the one
it designated as a "tyrant."
Every Friday, a large demonstration in support
of the regime is organized in a different city and all experts are unanimous
in considering that Colonel Gaddafi enjoys at least 90% of popular support
in Tripolitania and 70% across the entire country, including the "rebel"
areas.
These are people who every single day put up
with the blockade, aerial bombardments and ground fighting. Never would they
be defending with their flesh and blood someone who committed against them
the crimes of which he has been accused by the "international community."
The difference between those in the West who
believe that Gaddafi is a tyrant who fired on his own people, and those in
Libya who believe that he is a hero of the anti-imperialist struggle, is
that the former live in an
illusion created by TV propaganda, whereas the
others are exposed to the concrete reality on the ground.
That said, there is a second illusion to which the West has succumbed - and
in the "Western" camp I now include not only Israel, where it has always
claimed to belong, but also the monarchies of the Gulf Cooperation Council
and Turkey which, though of Eastern culture, have chosen to embrace it - the
illusion to think that it is still possible to devastate a country and kill
its people without legal consequences.
It is true that, until now, international
justice has been the justice of the victors or the powerful. One may recall
the Nazi official who heckled the judges at Nuremberg telling them that if
the Reich had won the war, the judges would have been the Nazis while those
held accountable for the war crimes would have been the Allies.
More recently, we saw how NATO used the International Criminal Tribunal for
the Former Yugoslavia to try to justify post facto that the war in Kosovo
was "the first humanitarian war in History," according to the expression
employed by Tony Blair. Or again, how the Special Tribunal for Lebanon was
used in an attempt to overthrow the Syrian government, then to decapitate
the Lebanese Hezbollah, and probably soon to accuse the Iranian
Revolutionary Guards.
Not to mention, the International Criminal Court, the
secular arm of the European colonial powers in Africa.
However, the development of instruments and organs of international justice
throughout the twentieth century has gradually established an international
order with which the superpowers themselves will have to comply or which
they will have to sabotage in order to escape their responsibilities. In the
case of Libya, the violations of international law are countless.
The main ones, presented below, were established
by the Provisional Technical Committee, a Libyan ministerial coordination
organ, and expounded at various press conferences by the legal adviser to
the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, French attorney Marcel Ceccaldi.[1]
TV channels which, under the leadership of their respective Governments,
have manufactured false information to lead to war, are guilty of "crimes
against peace", as defined by the relevant UN General Assembly resolutions
in the aftermath of World War II. [2]
The
journalist-propagandists should be considered even more culpable than the
military who perpetrated war crimes or crimes against humanity, to the
extent that none of these crimes would have been possible without the one
that preceded them: the "crime against peace."
The political leaders of the Atlantic Alliance, who diverted the object and
purpose of Resolution 1973 to engage in a war of aggression against a
sovereign state, are personally responsible before international justice.
Indeed, according to the jurisprudence established by the Tokyo Court
following the Second World War, crimes cannot be ascribed to either States
or organizations, but to individuals.
Plundering the assets of a state,
establishing a naval blockade and bombing infrastructure to cause people to
suffer, attacking an army inside its barracks and ordering the assassination
of enemy leaders or, failing this, terrorizing them by murdering their
families, all amount to war crimes. Their systematic perpetration, as is the
case today, constitutes a crime against humanity.
This crime is imprescriptible, which means that Messrs.
Obama, Sarkozy, Cameron and Al-Thani
will be pursued by the law for the rest of their lives.
NATO, as an organization, is legally responsible for the material and human
damage of this war. The law leaves no room for doubt that the organization
must pay, even though it will surely try to invoke a privilege of
jurisdiction to dodge its responsibilities. It will be up to the Alliance to
decide how the bill for the conflict should be split among Member States,
even though some of them may be on the verge of bankruptcy.
This will be
followed by disastrous economic consequences for their peoples, guilty of
having endorsed such crimes. In a democracy, no one can claim to be innocent
of the crimes committed in its name.
International justice will have to address more specifically the case of the
Sarkozy "administration" - I use this Anglicism here to underscore the fact
that the French president has been piloting his Governments policy
directly, without going through his prime minister.
Indeed, France has
played a central role in preparing for this war since October 2010 by
organizing a failed military coup and then, as early as November 2010, by
planning with the United Kingdom the bombing of Libya and the landing of
ground troops on its soil, which was then believed to be feasible, and
finally by actively conspiring in the lethal unrest in Benghazi which led to
the war.
In addition, France, more than any other power, has deployed Special Forces
on the ground - without uniforms, no doubt - and violated the arms embargo
by supplying the insurgents, either directly or through Qatari airplanes.
Not to mention that France has violated the UN freeze of Libyan assets,
funneling part of the fabulous cash from the Libyan Sovereign Fund to the CNT puppets, to the detriment of the Libyan people who wanted to guarantee
the well-being of their children in the face of oil depletion.
These gentlemen from NATO, who hoped to escape international justice by
crushing their victim, Libya, in a few short days so that it would not
survive to pursue them, will be disenchanted.
Libya is still there. She is
filing complaints with the International Criminal Court, the Belgian courts
(whose jurisdiction NATO falls under), the European Court of Justice, and
the national courts of aggressor states. She is undertaking steps before the
Council of Human Rights in Geneva, the Security Council and General Assembly
of the United Nations. It will be not be possible for the big powers to
extinguish these fires all at once.
Worse, the arguments they will use to evade a
court will ricochet against them in another court
In a few weeks or months, if they have not
succeeded in destroying Tripoli, they will have no other way out to avoid
humiliating convictions than to negotiate the withdrawal of the complaints
at a very high price.
Notes
[1] Putting an end to the confusion that
prevailed at the beginning of the war when various departments hired
lawyers for different disorderly proceedings, Libya has appointed Marcel
Ceccaldi in July to oversee all proceedings.
