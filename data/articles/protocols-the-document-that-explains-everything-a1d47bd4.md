# Protocols - The Document That Explains Everything

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/esp_sociopol_zion91.htm

PROTOCOL 1 - End Liberty
We will commit temporary evil from which will emerge the good of an
unshakable rule.
Violence and terrorism produce the best
results in governing the ignorant masses, not academic discussions.
Our power will remain invisible until the moment when it has gained such
strength that no cunning can undermine it.
The end justifies the means.
The power of Gold is the power which has replaced the liberal rulers.
We are despots (tyrants). The mob is savage. Their youth have grown
stupid from immorality, seduced by our special agents. The might of a
mob is a blind, senseless and un-reasoning force. Only those of us
trained to rule since childhood understand the words that make up the
political alphabet.
We must seize the property of others to secure submission and
sovereignty and will not stop at bribery, deceit and treachery.
We shall end liberty - marching along the path of peaceful conquest. We
must keep to the program of violence and MAKE-BELIEVE and to the
doctrine of severity (cruelty). We will triumph and bring all
governments into subjection to our super-government. In all corners of
the earth, our words "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," have put an end to
peace.
Human weaknesses cause men to hand over their will. We have triumphed
because of the insatiable material needs of the men we choose and the
representatives of the people that have given us our power.
Immoral men
are greater in number than the good.
PROTOCOL 2 - Wars & Surveillance
Wars will be started on economic grounds. Nations will receive our
monetary assistance.
Our millions of watchful eyes (spies & surveillance) will put both sides
of war at the mercy of our international agency (MI6).
National rights will be wiped out by our international rights and we
will rule the indebted nations.
We are bred and reared since childhood to
rule the affairs of the whole world.
We shall choose government
administrators for servile obedience as easy pawns in our game.
Destructive Education
The intellectuals
will teach all of the "false
information from science" which our agency specialists have cunningly
pieced together for the purpose of educating their minds in the
direction we want. Darwinism, Marxism, Nietzsche-ism.
The Media will create discontent and be made indispensable. Through the
Press we have gained the power to influence while remaining "in the
shadows".
Thanks to the Press, we have gathered GOLD out of oceans of
blood and tears.
PROTOCOL 3 - Poverty & Bankruptcy
Our goal is now only a few steps away.
All the States of Europe will be
locked in our coil. The Symbolic Snake symbolizes our people.
Disorders and bankruptcy will be universal. The constitution scales will
break down.
Forces are set in opposition to one another. We have armed all parties.
PROTESTERS
Our King with the BLOOD OF ZION is preparing for the world throne.
When the population has stormed its way to power, it will encounter
stumbling blocks. In the end they will turn to our King. We are an
invincible, international force. The hour will strike for our sovereign
Lord of all the world to be crowned.
The moment of attack will be known only to us. Abuses of Power will put
the final touch in preparing all institutions for their overthrow and
everything will fly skyward under the blows of the maddened mob. (Egypt, Libya,
Syria, Lebanon etc.)
Poverty is a weapon. All people are chained down to heavy toil by
poverty believing that one way or another, they might free themselves.
We have included in the constitution fictitious, not actual rights.
We support communism. We appear as saviors but our power is in the
chronic shortness of food and physical weakness of the worker because he
is made the slave of our will, and he will not find strength or energy
to go against our will. Hunger creates the right of capital (money) to
rule the worker.
We shall wipe out protesters (FEMA). By desire and the envy and hatred
it engenders, we shall move the mobs and with their OWN hands (policing
themselves). The ignorant masses are unthinking. They do not see the
urgent necessity of what we shall adopt at when our kingdom (New World
Order) comes.
There is no equality. The masses will voluntarily submit
to authority and accept positions appointed to them by the State.
ECONOMIC CRISIS
There will be a
universal economic crisis.
Stock exchanges will shut down. Industry
will be brought to a standstill. We shall throw the mobs of workers on
the streets simultaneously in all European countries and they will loot
and kill. Hatred will be magnified by the economic crisis. We will use
cruelty wisely, knowing how to pacify all unrest and shut off freedom
in all institutions.
Secret "subterranean" (underground) methods will be used by us to create
this crisis. The gold is all in our hands.
Brute force turns mobs into
bloodthirsty beasts. When they have drunk their fill of blood, they can
easily be riveted into their chains. We will be safe because we will
take protective steps.
We shall erase the word "freedom" when we come into our Kingdom. The
word "freedom" brings out the communities of men to fight.
PROTOCOL 4 - End Religion
Every republic passes through stages - mad raging by the blind mob,
demagogy and anarchy will inevitably lead to our despotism (absolute
power).
Freemasonry blindly serves as a screen for us and our objectives, but
the plan of action of our force, remains an unknown mystery.
Who and
what can overthrow our invisible force?
WE SHALL DESTROY GOD.
It is indispensible for us to undermine
all
faith and to put in its place arithmetical calculations and material
needs.
MIND CONTROL
The minds of the ignorant masses must be diverted and given NO TIME TO
THINK. Nations will be swallowed up in pursuit of gain.
Through
speculation, industry will take from the land. The resources will slip
through the hands of the people into our hands.
The lower classes will follow our lead against our intellectual rivals
who we have already made cold and heartless from our economic blows.
When the hour strikes, we will be their only guide.
PROTOCOL 5 - LAWS & LIES
We shall create centralized government.
New laws will withdraw one by one all the indulgences and liberties
permitted to the ignorant masses. Our kingdom will wipe out any who
oppose us.
We have no rivals. We are secure by the deep roots of discord that exist
within the masses. We have set one against another, escalating religious
and race hatreds over the past centuries.
Nations cannot reach any
private agreement without us secretly having a hand in it.
The monopoly of industry and trade by our
unseen hand is in all quarters of the world.
Disarming the people is
more important now than leading them into war. Our principle objective
is to weaken the public mind by criticism, to lead them away from
resistance and distract them towards an empty fight that leads nowhere.
The masses fall for false promises. They fall for words and "show", not
deeds. We shall pretend to be liberals of all parties, of all
directions. Public opinion is in our hands.
We sow the seeds of discord. We multiply national failures and cause
public disorientation through chaos. The people will consequently fail
to understand one another. This will discourage personal initiative that
might hinder our agenda.
We will form a super-government using all means to wear down the
population. In place of the rulers of today, we shall set up a
Super-Government Administration which will reach out in all directions
with such colossal dimensions (United Nations) that it cannot fail to
subdue all the nations of the world.
PROTOCOL 6 - Debt & Propaganda
We will use propaganda to conceal the truth by pretending to serve the
working classes and great principles of the political economy.
Our super-government will be promoted as Protector and Benefactor of all
those who voluntarily submit to us.
We will increase the debt burdens and take the land.
We shall enslave the masses. Through industry, both labor and capital
will drain from the land. Through speculation (stock markets), all of
the world's money will fall into our hands.
The masses will bow down
before us to get the right to exist.
We will raise wages and prices at the same
time to complete the ruin of the industry and justify it as a decline in
agriculture. We will promote worker ANARCHY, immorality, eliminate the
educated class and undermine production.
PROTOCOL 7 - Universal War
Increasing weapons and police forces are essential to complete our
plans. Besides ourselves, there will be others devoted to our interests.
We must create discord and hostility and entanglements politically,
economically and through loan obligations throughout Europe and on other
continents.
We use the "official" mask of honesty and complacency but we must use
cunning in negotiations and agreements.
We will be seen as the benefactors and saviors of the human race.
We will respond to every act of opposition
through war.
We will make war with countries that dare to oppose us. If
countries collectively oppose us, we must resist with a universal WORLD
WAR.
Our words should contradict deeds as the principal factor of success in
our politics of secrecy.
Governments must act in line with our agenda so that public opinion is
secretly promoted by us.
With few exceptions,
the media is already in
our hands.
PROTOCOL 8 - Weapons
We must arm ourselves with all the weapons that our opponents might use
against us.
Those trained in our special schools (Yale, Princeton, Cambridge etc.)
will surround our directorate - publicists, practical jurists,
administrators, diplomats and zionists.
They will have knowledge of social structure secrets and the underside
of human nature.
These administrators serve us for their own mercenary
reasons and ambition.
Economists, bankers, industrialists,
capitalists will surround our government. Economic sciences are the
principal subject of our training. Everything will be settled by
numbers.
The disobedient must face criminal charges or disappear.
PROTOCOL 9 - Corruption & Terror
We shall kill and we shall spare. We rule by force of will.
Our weapons
are our limitless ambitions, our burning greed, merciless vengeance,
hatred and malice. The all-engulfing terror proceeds from us.
Our servants are of all doctrines - monarchists, socialists, communists
and dreamers of every kind. Each one erodes the last remnants of
authority to overthrow the established order. All States will be
tortured and ready to sacrifice everything for peace.
We will not allow peace until all nations acknowledge our international
super-government and submit to us.
Political party divisions gives us the power
because they need money and the money is all in our hands.
The blind
force of the mob is our support.
We shall provide them with a leader and
direct them along the road that leads to our goal.
We infiltrate the administration of the law, elections, the press,
liberty of the person, education and training.
We have corrupted the youth by rearing them in "false" principles and
theories. We have twisted laws into contradictions of interpretations
which mask the law in a tangled web of legislation that is impossible
to figure out.
The mob will rise against us if they guess what is going on before the
time comes...but in the West we have such appalling terror that the
underground organizations will be blown into the air.
PROTOCOL 10 - Coup D'Etat
The mob respects and admires political power and accepts all their deeds
of violence.
World power is our goal.
We divide authority, property, dwelling, taxation using the reflex force
of the laws without attracting attention.
When we achieve our coup d'état, we shall tell the people,
"Everything has gone badly and everyone
is worn out from suffering. We will destroy the causes of war and
suffering. The causes are different nationalities, different
currencies and border wars. Before you condemn us, look at what we
are offering you."
The mob will then exalt us with their hopes
and expectations.
The people will submit to this regime because its
earnings, gratifications and benefits will depend on it. The scheme of
government should be forcible and of one mind.
We shall establish presidents as puppets in our hands. Elections will be
arranged to favor presidents with a dark past who fear exposure. Their
desire is to attain power, privileges, advantages and honor connected
with the office of president. The right will be given to us to make and
change laws. The president shall be given the right to declare war as
chief of the whole army of the country. The key lies in our hands and no
one outside of us will direct the force of legislation.
The President's administration will be made scapegoats in his place for
violations.
This act will be played by the Senate, the Council of State,
or the Council of Ministers, but not individual officials. At our
discretion, the president will annul laws when we ask and deviate from
the constitution under the pretext of doing it for the supreme welfare
of the State.
We will destroy the constitutions of States to prepare for the
transition to our DESPOTISM (absolute authority). We will arrange for
the incompetence of rulers.
The people will become utterly wearied by
their rulers and will clamor,
"Away with them and give us one king over
all the earth who will unite us and annihilate the causes of disorders -
borders, nationalities, religions, debts - who will give us peace and
quiet which we cannot find under our rulers and representatives."
We will incite trouble between the people and their governments in all
countries and exhaust humanity with dissention, hatred, struggle, envy
and even by the use of TORTURE and STARVATION and the INOCULATION OF
DISEASES.
The people will take refuge in our complete sovereignty in money and all
else. We must not give the nations of the world breathing space.
PROTOCOL 11 - End Rights
Human rights must disappear.
Freedom of the Press, the right of
association, freedom of conscience, the voting principle, and many other
rights will be crushed. We crush with irresistible power all resistance
in every moment and in every place.
We shall never divide our power with the people.
In fear and trembling,
they will close their eyes to everything and be content to await what
will happen in the end.
We are wolves and the masses are sheep. We
shall keep promising to give back all the liberties we have taken away
but they will wait an eternity for the return of their liberties.
Our organization of SECRET MASONRY is not not known or even suspected by
those who we have attracted into the army of Masonic Lodges.
PROTOCOL 12 - Media & Thought Control
All freedom will be in our hands, since the laws will abolish and will
create only what is desirable for us. The majority have no idea what
ends the press really serves.
We shall inflict fines without mercy on those who attack us. Among those
who attack us will be groups ESTABLISHED BY US. They will only attack
what we already need to alter.
NO NEWS WILL REACH THE PUBLIC WITHOUT OUR CONTROL. All news items are
received by a few agencies (Associated Press, Reuters) in all parts of
the world.
These agencies will be entirely ours and will give publicity
only to what we dictate to them.
The public will view world news events we
put under their noses through colored glasses.
Thought control will be in the hands of our government. The masses will
be led astray with fantasies of "progress". Liberals and anarchists
chasing after freedom will protest for the sake of protest. We shall
publish our own works for profit and spread our influence.
Literary men
will be made dependent on us. Those who write against us will find no
publisher. We will monopolize the press and media. On the front lines
will be our top ranked officials. They will always stand guard over our
interests.
We will set up our own undercover opponents. This will flush out our
real opponents who will show us their cards.
Our media will be aristocratic, republican, revolutionary, even
anarchical. We will have a hundred hands with our fingers on all public
opinions. Those fools who think they have an opinion will be repeating
our opinion or any opinion that is desirable to us.
We will print truth, then lies, facts or their contradictions. We will
tranquillize the public mind on political questions, persuade and
confuse. We will triumph over our opponents who do not own the press and
cannot give full expression to their views.
Journalists are bound by professional secrecy. Not one journalist will
betray this secret. To practice journalism, they must have a dark past
and a fear of being exposed.
We must not admit any public dishonesty during our transition to our new
power regime (New World Order).
Cases of our criminality should remain
known only to their victims and to chance witnesses. No more.
PROTOCOL 13 - Distractions
We distract the masses with entertainment, games, past-times, passions
(porn), art and sport.
They will parrot our opinions because we alone
offer them new directions for thought through people (celebrities) who
they don't suspect are aligned with us.
We will direct the minds of the masses towards vanity and fantastic
theories that they falsely believe are new and progressive.
We will turn
their brainless heads with progress until they can no longer perceive
the truth.
None will know the obscured truth except us. When, we come into our
kingdom, our representatives will express the great problems which
turned humanity upside down in order to bring it under our beneficial
rule.
We stage-manage the masses who don't suspect or even guess what our
political plan is over the course of many centuries.
PROTOCOL 14 - 'God'
We are the chosen people.
The destiny of the
world is under our God. We must sweep away all other forms of
belief. The preaching of the religion of Moses has brought all the
peoples of the world into subjection to us.
Peace will be a "forced" peace after centuries of agitation. The people
will prefer peace in a state of serfdom (slavery) than the rights of
freedom which have tortured, exhausted and exploited humanity.
The people will be weary from suffering under their governments that we
control.
They will prefer to suffer anything under us than risk more of
the torment and misery they have suffered under their governments.
We shall forbid religion.
No one will
question our faith since it will be known only to us. Its secrets shall
never be betrayed.
We have created senseless, filthy, abominable media in countries that
are considered progressive and enlightened.
Our wise men, trained to
become leaders will create speeches, projects, memoirs, articles, which
will direct them towards understanding and knowledge determined by us.
PROTOCOL 15 - Secret Societies
Plots against us will cease to exist when we come into our kingdom by a
COUPS D'ETAT.
We shall kill without mercy all who take up arms against our kingdom
(New World Order). Every kind of secret society will also be punished
with death. Those who are known to us, serve us and have served us, we
will disband and send into exile to continents far removed from Europe.
In this way, we shall deal with Masons who know too much.
Masons who we spare will be kept in fear of exile. We shall promulgate a
law making all former members of secret societies liable to exile from
Europe as the center of rule.
NEW WORLD ORDER
Resolutions of our super-government will be final and without appeal.
We shall create and multiply Freemasonic
lodges until we come into our kingdom in all the countries of the world.
Politicians and agents of national and international police will become
members. These lodges will be our principal intelligence office and
means of influence and we shall bring them under one central
administration known to us alone.
The most secret political plots will be known to us and fall under our
guiding hands. In the Freemasonic lodges we shall tie together all
revolutionary and liberal elements from every strata of society. If
there is a plot against us, the head of that plot will be one of our
trusted servants.
The class of people who enter into secret societies are mostly dim
witted.
We lead MASONIC activities knowing the final goal of every form
of activity. The ignorant Masons know nothing. They enter the lodges out
of curiosity and a thirst for success and applause. The reason we give
them success is to make use of their conceit to assimilate them in our
direction. How easy it is to take the heart out of them by reducing them
to slavish submission.
Death is the inevitable end for all. It is better to bring that end
nearer for those who hinder our agenda. They die when required from what
seems like a natural illness. Knowing this, even the brotherhood dare
not protest. By these methods, we have plucked out of the midst of
MASONRY the very root of protest. While preaching freedom, at the same
time we keep our own people and our agents in a state of unquestioning
submission.
We dictate to judges the most important and fundamental affairs and
questions. Even senators and the higher administration accept our
counsels.
When we rule the world overtly, we shall remake all legislatures, all
our laws will be brief, plain, stable, without any kind of
interpretations, so that anyone will understand them perfectly. Abuses
of power will be mercilessly punished. Our power demands cruel
punishments for the slightest infringement.
All the money in the world will be concentrated in our hands,
consequently our government does not have to fear expense.
WORLD KING
Our government rule will be a patriarchal paternal guardianship.
Our ruler will be perceived as a father
caring for every need of his subjects. To live in peace and quiet, his
subjects will believe that his wardship and guidance is indispensible
and they will be devoted to him. Everything in the world is in a state
of submission to what is stronger.
We will be this something stronger
for the sake of good.
When the King of Israel (King William V) sets upon his sacred head the
crown offered him by Europe, he will become patriarch of the world.
Our
King will be in constant communion with the people, making speeches and
his fame will be known worldwide in that same hour.
PROTOCOL 16 - Education
We will re-educate and destroy all collective forces except ours.
University officials and professors will be made dependent upon the
government.
We must introduce into the education system all those
principles which break up their order.
We shall remove every kind of disturbing subject from education once we
are in power and we will turn the youth into obedient children of
authority.
WORLD KING
Our world ruler will win the hearts and
minds of his subjects. He will instruct the world about all his
beneficial initiatives.
We shall change history. Any form of study of ancient history, in which
there are more bad than good examples, we shall replace with the study
of the program of the future.
We shall erase from the memory of men - all
facts of previous centuries which are undesirable to us, and leave only
those which depict all the errors of their past government.
Each individual must be trained within strict limits corresponding to
their lower lot and work in life. The occasional genius may emerge but
will not be allowed into our ranks.
We will abolish every kind of freedom of instruction.
Independence of
thought which we have been directing for a long time will be directed
towards subjects and ideas useful to us. The system of bridling thought
is already at work in the teaching system and turning the masses into
unthinking submissive brutes.
They wait for things to be presented to them
for ideas.
PROTOCOL 17 - Clergy
We shall destroy the clergy.
We have discredited the priesthood. When the time comes to destroy the
faith in the Pope and papacy, our invisible hand will be at work.
When the nations attack the papacy, we shall come forward "disguised" as
its defenders to stop the bloodshed. By this diversion we will destroy
the power of the papacy and penetrate its bowels, gnawing away its
entire strength until we take its place.
Our King will be the real Pope of the Universe and the Patriarch of the
world church. In the meantime while we are re-educating the youth in new
religions and afterwards in ours, we will use divisive criticism of
established religions.
Our press (media) will continue to criticize
State affairs, religions and inadequacies using the most unprincipled
methods to lower their prestige.
One third of the population will voluntarily spy on the rest out of a
sense of duty and service to the State. It will not be a disgrace to be
a spy and an informer, but a merit.
Our agents will be taken from the
higher and lower ranks of society with no rights to act on their own
account.
Our bretheren are obliged to turn in family members at their own risk to
the Kabal if they have been doing anything in opposition to the KABAL.
In our world kingdom, our subjects have a duty of service to the State.
PROTOCOL 18 - Dissidents
Our undercover dissidents will provoke a phony uprising with their
speeches and attract those who follow his words (Alex Jones). This will
give us the pretext for surveillance on the part of our servant police.
There will be spies in our midst.
Until our dissident enemies commit an
overt act, we shall not lay a finger on them. Their interest in leading
will be reduced when they discover conspiracies against them.
We have broken the will of our dissident enemies by our frequent
attempts on their lives through our agents.
WORLD KING
Our ruler King will be secretly protected
even by the most insignificant guard.
We will not admit to critical attacks
against our King that he has to hide from or can't deal with. If we
admit weakness, we would be signing a death sentence, if not for our
ruler, then for his dynasty (the Windsors).
Our ruler will use his power only for the advantage of the nation and
not for his own or dynastic profits according to strictly enforced
outward appearances. Therefore, his authority will be respected and
guarded by his subjects because their well-being depends on him. Our
ruler will always be surrounded by a mob of curious men and women, who
will occupy the front ranks around him and will restrain the ranks of
the rest.
Criminals will be arrested on well-grounded SUSPICION. An opportunity of
escape should not be given to persons suspected of a political crime.
In
these matters we shall be merciless.
PROTOCOL 19 - Trials
We will destroy the prestige of heroism for committing a political crime
against us. We will send the perpetrator to trial in the category of
thieving, murder, and every kind of abominable and filthy crime.
Public opinion will be changed out of confusion and will brand a
political crime against us with contempt instead of heroism.
We have brought thousands into the ranks of our livestock cattle.
We will encourage every kind of proposal to
the government and examine all kinds of projects for the betterment of
the condition of the people; this will reveal to us the defects or
fantasies of our subjects.
PROTOCOL 20 - Money & Bankruptcy
The financial program is the crowning of our plans.
The sum total of our
actions is settled by numbers. When we come into our kingdom our
autocratic government will avoid taxing the people.
We play the part of father and protector. Our king will enjoy the legal
fiction that everything in his State belongs to him.
The World State
will resort to the lawful confiscation of all sums of every kind.
There will be a progressive tax on property.
Individual or property tax
is useful to us now because it causes trouble and discontent.
The force upon which our King will rest is
the guarantee of peace which is why the capitalists should yield up a
portion of their incomes to the State.
Such a measure will destroy the
hatred of the poor man for the rich. He will see the rich man as the
organizer of peace and well-being.
Our king will not have any properties of his own since it would destroy
the right of property in the common possessions of all. Relatives of the
King, excluding his heirs, will be maintained by the resources of the
State.
Public works initiatives will blind the working class to the interests
of the State and to those who reign. Part will be set aside from these
same sums as rewards of inventiveness and productiveness.
Economic crises have been created by us by withdrawing money from
circulation.
Huge capitals have stagnated. State finances are burdened
with loans and interest payments. They are made the bond slaves of these
stagnant capitals. Capitalists have taken from the hands of small
masters and monopolized industry. They have drained away all the juices
of the peoples and with them also the States.
Children are considered consumers of currency from birth. The issue of
money corresponds with population growth.
The Gold Standard has been the ruin of States who adopted it. We have
removed gold from circulation as far as possible. We issue money -
adding to the quantity with every birth and subtracting with every
death.
Our financial reforms will not alarm the population. We will show them
the necessity of reforms because of the disorderliness and
irregularities that caused their financial markets to plunge.
The annual budget is tripled every ten years. Year after year, the
budget grows and ends up to be a liquidation budget. Thanks to the
carelessness of States, their treasuries are empty. The loan period has
swallowed up remainders and brought all the States to bankruptcy. (The
United States was declared "bankrupt" at the Geneva Convention of 1929
[see 31 USC 5112, 5118, and 5119).
Loans hang like a sword over governments who come begging to our
bankers. Foreign loans are leeches which can never be removed from the
body of the State.
They put more DEBT on themselves and must inevitably
perish.
TYRANNY OF USURY
Money is shuffled from the poor to the rich, but when we bought the
necessary person (politicians) the wealth of States flowed into our
cash-boxes.
The corruption of ministers and the ignorance of other ruling persons on
financial matters have turned countries into debtors to our treasuries
in amounts that are impossible to pay. This has cost us heavy
expenditures of trouble and money.
The stagnation of money, parasitic profits and idleness are useful to us
but we will put an end to those abuses which we have mastered when our
new kingdom comes. Our system of accounting will be fool proof.
(The "private corporation" known as the
"Internal Revenue Service," collects the "payments of Income Taxes" and
deposits those "payments" into
the Federal Reserve bank of
the banksters
- never into the Treasury of the United States).
PROTOCOL 21 - Loans
We have taken advantage of the corruption of administrators and the
slackness of rulers to get our moneys twice, thrice and more times over
by lending money to governments which were not needed by the States.
We made new loans to get interest payments
on old loans which added to the capital debt.
And when this credit is
exhausted, new taxes will only cover our interest on the loan.
We shall demand all our moneys back. Nowadays, tricks cannot be played
by borrowers.
Acknowledged bankruptcy will prove to countries that the
rulers can not serve the interests of the people.
When we ascend the throne of the world, financial dealings that do not
serve our interests will be swept away.
We shall replace the money
markets by grandiose government credit institutions that will fix prices
and make all industrial undertakings dependent on us.
PROTOCOL 22 - Evil
All the evil we have committed for many centuries has served the cause
of bringing everything into order and well- being.
Gold is the greatest
power of our day. We can procure from our storehouses any quantity we
please.
Our rule is predestined by God (Satan).
Surely we shall not fail with
such wealth.
Through violence, our Kingdom will be
established.
We shall prove that we are benefactors who have restored
the true good and freedom to the mangled earth. Every person can enjoy
peace and quiet on the condition of strict observance of our established
laws.
One all-powerful authority will rule and guide. This authority will
inspire a bowing of the knee before it and a reverent fear of it by all
the people.
True force makes no terms, not even with God.
PROTOCOL 23 - Obedience
To accustom the peoples to obedience, it is necessary to teach lessons
of humility and to reduce the production of luxury items. We shall
improve morals which have been debased by emulating luxury lifestyles.
Drunkenness will also be prohibited by law and punishable as a crime
against humanness of man who is turned into a brute under the influence
of alcohol.
WORLD KING
Subjects do not want an angelic spirit in a king.
What they have to see
in him is the personification of force and power. They give blind
obedience only to the strong hand. The supreme lord will replace all
existing rulers in societies that we have demoralized and that have
denied even the authority of God.
Our King must be obliged to kill off those societies where there is
anarchy and resurrect them again using organized fighting troops.
This Chosen One of God (Satan) is chosen from above to demolish the
senseless forces that rule by instinct and not reason, by brutishness
and humanness. Behind the mask of freedom and rights, these forces now
triumph in robberies and violence. They overthrow all forms of social
order and erect on the ruins the throne of the King.
The moment he
enters into his kingdom, they will be swept from his path.
Then we will say to the peoples of the world, give thanks to God and bow
the knee before him who bears on his front the seal of the pre-destiny
of man, to which God himself has led his star that none other than Him
might free us from all the forces and evils.
PROTOCOL 24 - World King
We confirm the dynastic roots of King David to the last strata of the
earth.
The education of thought of all humanity will be directed by this
confirmation.
Certain members of the seed of David (Windsors) will prepare the kings
and their heirs.
They will be inducted into the most secret mysteries of
the political schemes of government, but none will have knowledge of the
secrets.
Only those of our learned elders who can be
firm and cruel will rule under the mask of freedom and rights.
In case
of weakness, kings must by law hand over rule to new and capable hands.
The king's plan of action for now and for the future will be unknown,
even to those who are called his closest counselors.
Only the king and his three sponsors will know what is coming.
The king
with unbending will is master of himself and of humanity. None will know
what the king wishes to attain by his dispositions, and therefore none
will dare to stand across an unknown path.
The brain reservoir of the king must correspond in capacity to the plan
of government. He will ascend the throne after examination of his mind
by the learned elders.
The people may know and love their king. He will converse in the
market-places with his people. This will mend the two forces which are
now divided by us from the terror we commit. This terror was
indispensable for us until the time comes for both these forces
separately to fall under our influence.
Our king must not be at the mercy of his passions, and especially of
sensuality.
On no side of his character must he give brute instincts
power over his mind. Sensuality worse than all else disorganizes the
capacities of the mind and clearness of views, distracting the thoughts
to the worst and most brutal side of human activity.
The supreme lord of all the world of the holy seed of David must
sacrifice to his people all personal inclinations. Our supreme lord must
set an example and be irreproachable.
