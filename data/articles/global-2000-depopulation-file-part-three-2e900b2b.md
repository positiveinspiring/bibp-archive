The Alternative to Global 2000
(From Revelations of Awareness 82-4)
This Awareness suggests that this present reading be a continuation of that which ended previously in regard to the Global 2000 program for population reduction by the year 2000. This Awareness suggests that when printing up the material, you may consider or designate this in two parts; first the bad news, then the good news, which may be presented at this time.
This Awareness indicates that the information given in the previous discussion regarding the Global 2000 program, which is being planned and implemented by the world planners,--those who have appointed themselves as guardians of the human race upon this plane,--this Awareness indicates that this program It described previously as that which would lead to the annihilation of at least two-thirds or more of the population of this planet through plagues, through biological conditions, famine, war, and other types of annihilation, and through birth control programs; this as that which is a movement and does have much power in its movement.
This Awareness indicates that on the other hand, this as that which is being promoted by a small number of entities; though this number of entities holds great power upon this plane,--enough to move mountains with their control, power and influence. This Awareness indicates enough to annihilate masses with their control, power, and influence, unless the masses awaken and realize who these entities are who are pulling the strings, the triggers, the manipulations; who these entities are who are dispensing the poisons, who are giving the medicines which are annihilating, who are pushing the buttons which are destroying, who are manipulating the nations and economies to lead to starvation and warfare.
This Awareness indicates the masses are beginning to stir, and there are many entities who are aware of these intentions. This Awareness indicates there are many in levels of power who do not approve or condone this plan, and whose consciousness are beginning to stir and to cause them to respond and react in ways which are not conductive to the plan. This Awareness indicates there are others who are aware of the plan and are outright opposed to the plan, and are taking action to prevent continuation of such implementation of the plan.
The Elemental Kingdom is getting disturbed
This Awareness indicates that apart from the entities upon this plane who are offering the beginnings of awakening and resistance to such a plan, there are also entities from the elemental kingdom, those associated with nature forces, who are greatly disturbed by the forces who have violated the laws of nature on this plane, and who are now beginning to join together in certain purposes to have an effect, which will be felt upon this plane in some short time. This Awareness indicates this in various ways within the next 20 years.
This Awareness indicates that these forces have much power and can turn the energies away from the artificial constructions of man, whereby the natural forces of nature may be affected to bring about great changes which can cause the best laid plans of mice and men to go awry. This Awareness indicates that there are also other unseen forces and there are potentials in consciousness which can emerge among the masses, bringing about changes in attitude, creating new leadership which can bring forth new plans and programs of these self-appointed annihilators of humanity, and bring about new programs to accommodate entities who are present upon this plane.
This Awareness indicates that if land were managed properly, if the seas were managed properly, if the air was managed properly, wherein production was turned from war-making machinery and industry to industrial and agricultural programs designed to feed and house and clothe the needy,--both on land and sea; whereby the sea was managed in a balanced way, so that the entire planet maintained its ecological and biological harmony,--then indeed, it would be possible to support the 10 billion entities who are on the physical plane of the Earth, and in the astral surrounding the physical plane of the Earth.
This Awareness indicates that the proper management would require that entities turn their concerns away from greed structures to that of a social consciousness, whereby the concern moves to service for all, rather than service for the elite at the expense of the underlings. This Awareness indicates that this would be a radical change in consciousness, which under present circumstances is not likely to occur.
This Awareness indicates that therefore, in order for this to occur, circumstances must change; there must become incidents and circumstances which shock consciousness into awakening and demanding that better management upon this plane be brought into position of authority. This Awareness indicates that for this to occur, there must be the communication that allows entities to recognize the possibility for an alternative to that Global 2000 program; and the opportunity of the alternative must be given in such a manner as to allow entities to envision and understand what steps must be taken to bring about these changes.
Go Out and Plant Some Tree
(remember this is from a reading in
1982)
This Awareness indicates that there are seeds planted upon this plane in terms of ideas, concepts, motives, and desires to see a unified world wherein entities are fed, clothed and housed in lands whose purposes are to bring forth cooperative actions among citizens of all nations. This Awareness indicates these seeds are scattered in different groups, in different places, in the minds of individuals, artists, writers, teachers, communities in various nations. This Awareness indicates there is that program being suggested whereby entities plant fruit trees and nut trees in public parks, in public places, in forests, in areas where entities ten years from now and thereafter may walk along and have at their own disposal the fruit from these trees. This Awareness indicates this as one concept which can feed hundreds or thousands, depending on the responsiveness of entities to this idea, to this concept, and to the urgency which brings this in.
This Awareness indicates that these concepts need to be brought to the attention of civic leaders and of others who have places, or who donate land to allow such trees to be planted. This Awareness indicates that similarly, these concepts need to be spread to other countries, whereby trees and other vegetation can be planted which will allow others to feed themselves and future generations through public concerns and programs of this type.
This Awareness indicates that there also need to be greater efforts toward the energy programs,--particularly solar, wind, geothermal, and other alternative inventions and devices which can create alternatives to the use of petroleum and other polluting forms of energy.
This Awareness indicates that there need to be programs which educate the masses to understand the ecological balance of forces upon the earth, the need to have clean rivers, the need to have soil which is not polluted, the need to use nature to improve upon natural methods of farming and of developing produce from the land. This Awareness indicates that there need to be educational programs to teach entities to respect the balance necessary in the sea, in the rivers, in the forests, and in the air; to maintain proper oxygen, proper nitrogen and the proper balance so that pollutions and poisons do not destroy lakes and fishes, animals and vegetation.
This Awareness indicates that there need to be educational programs to teach the masses about the manipulations of corporations whose sole interest is in raping the Earth to gain whatever power and economic advantage can be gained at whatever expense. This Awareness indicates that these programs, educating the masses, can lead to better informed citizens who can cast their vote, voice their concerns, express their feelings, and make known their demands to a leadership, so that the leadership must recognize that its days are numbered unless the voice of the people is heard.
This Awareness indicates the only way these programs and changes in consciousness can occur is for entities to begin putting forth extra effort, --to support, to focus on, to express interest in, to advertise, to talk about and to share with others their information and concerns, and to give their energies to those programs, groups and individuals who are dedicated to bringing about the alternative to those destructive forces.
This Awareness indicates that though the future for mankind looks black at this time, it has been even more bleak in other times; and there are now glimmers of light which are ever-increasing upon the face of the Earth, giving a hope for the future, even as the Forces of Darkness gather momentum. This Awareness indicates this likened unto the darkness just before the dawn, but whereby entities with keen perception, can see the coming light on the Eastern horizon of the future.
Why Awareness has come to this plane
This Awareness indicates that It is not able to give assurance which entities may wish to have; It can only give assessments of the energies which are in motion and which could be brought into motion. This Awareness indicates that many entities are not willing or capable of listening or learning what is occurring. Many entities would prefer to drink their beer, to watch their television comedies, to lie in the warm arms of their friend, to hold onto their Raggedy-Ann security blankets, and to remain totally ignorant. Many entities would pay not to know what is going on. This Awareness indicates It cannot appease these entities; for to be aware requires that entities be vulnerable, willing to become somewhat insecure in order to know how to deal with situations which may occur, or which are already occurring.
This Awareness indicates that therefore, It cannot give any present-time security and lull entities back to sleep, to rest easy, or to inform entities that all is well upon this plane; It cannot force these energies to cease to exist, for this is that what occurs when entities become aware. The more entities become aware of the dark shadows, the more the dark shadow forces are brought into the light of awareness; the less force and power those dark energies can have. This Awareness indicates that Its purpose in communicating is to turn the light upon those shadows, those areas of darkness, so that entities can see full well the motives, intentions, activities which are occurring, or being planned. This awareness is that which can have its effect on changing the future of those plans.
This Awareness indicates that the actions to dealing with these conditions as that which requires mass education of entities. This Awareness indicates that much of the military appropriation for educational needs to be disseminated throughout the world. This Awareness indicates that to solve problems with the simplistic approach of mass-murder is that which is most appealing to many in power, rather than enhancing educational opportunities throughout the world.
This Awareness indicates that many entities in power do not relish the thought of the masses becoming more educated than is necessary for them to function as servants or robot beings. This Awareness indicates that when a nation begins curtailing its education and healing systems for military operations and development, it reflects a change in values from humanitarian to utilitarian approaches.
This Awareness indicates there ARE ways and there ARE means which can bring about results, and these can be more human than other ways and other means. This Awareness indicates that this needs greater attention from the press, from the masses so that these means, these methods of education can replace the means and methods of war.
Planet Earth,
itself, is being prepared for a kind of rejuvenation
This Awareness indicates that the planet
Earth, itself is being prepared for a kind of rejuvenation, for this planet
has been tended likened unto a garden by many entities from many systems, not
only within the created realm, but also from areas of the immortal realms, and
that entities from various intergalactic systems have put much energy into preparing
this place to be beautiful, to be harmonious and in a balance, and these energies
existed and were placed into this planet long before the modern warfare machines
and greed forces gained control, and these entities do not intend to allow these
greed forces and the modern competitive war machines to destroy this planet
as Maldek was destroyed.
But, rather, these entities shall find
that before they are given the opportunity to destroy themselves and the planet,
they shall be removed from this planet and placed upon that other planet wherein
they may make war upon one another to their heart's content. This Awareness
indicates that the peace-loving entities of this plane, on the Earth, shall
be given another opportunity, and shall be given that garden which they may
enjoy and may express as a new world likened unto other worlds which exists
on other planets.
This Awareness indicates most entities
do not realize that the Earth and its consciousness is likened unto an abomination
to most of the other worlds in the universe, for it is so degraded in comparison
to their levels of existence that it is considered likened an outcast of the
universe.

Force may be Celebrating Victory Prematurely

The Depopulation Bomb
"[Sterilization could] be applied to an ever widening circle of social discards, beginning always with the criminal, the diseased and the insane, and extending gradually to types which may be called weaklings rather than defectives, and perhaps ultimately to worthless race types."
