The Bilderberg group will conduct its annual meeting June 3-6 in
Sitges,
Spain (a small, exclusive resort town about 20 miles from Barcelona) behind
a wall of armed guards who will seal off the resort in a futile attempt to
keep the event secret.
Bilderbergs meeting will follow that of its brother group, the
Trilateral
Commission, which will gather at the Four Seasons Resort in Dublin, Ireland
May 6-10.
Leaders of Bilderberg also attend the Trilateralists meeting to
map their common agenda. About 300 attend Trilateral Commission meetings,
which are conducted behind sealed-off, guarded floors of their hotel. About
100 will attend Bilderberg, which seals off the entire resort behind
platoons of uniformed police and private security.
Bilderberg hopes to keep the
global recession going for at least a year,
according to an international financial consultant who deals personally with
many of them. This is because, among several reasons, Bilderberg still hopes
to create a global treasury department under the United Nations.
Bilderberg first undertook this mission at its meeting last spring in
Greece, but the effort was blocked by nationalists in Europe and the United
States. Nationalists (a dirty word in Bilderberg) objected to surrendering
sovereignty to the UN.
AFPs source pointed to the words of French President Nicolas Sarkozy in a
March 29 speech at notoriously left-wing Columbia University, where he said,
We should invent a new global monetary order.
He was clearly referring to the recently proposed world treasury
department.
Bilderbergs ultimate goal remains unchanged: Turn the UN (The
United Nations) into a world
government with nation-states becoming merely geographic references. The
European Union is to become a single political entity, followed by the
American Union and, finally, the Asian-Pacific Union.
The American
Union is to include the entire Western Hemisphere, including Cuba and other
offshore islands.
Like the EU, the AU will have a legislature, executive commission and head
of state which can impose laws on member nations. There is to be an EU-like
common currency, removing each member states symbol of sovereignty. The
Asian-Pacific Union, or APU, is to follow a similar path.
But growing public awareness of the evil agenda of Bilderberg and the
Trilateralists has emerged as a significant barrier. For decades, until 1975
when
The Spotlight emerged, the blackout was 100 percent complete worldwide.
(The Spotlight is AFPs lineal ancestor.)
Today, in Europe, major metropolitan newspapers and broadcast outlets give
both groups heavy, front-page attention. In the United States, independent
newspapers and broadcast stations give Bilderberg extensive coverage.
But the
major newspapers and network broadcasters maintain a complete
blackout in the United States. Thats because their executives have attended
these meetings on lifetime promises of secrecy. The hypocritical owners of
The Washington Post have attended since 1954.
The Posts chairman, Donald
Graham, and associate editor, Jimmy Lee Hoagland, have attended each meeting
for years.
But as public awareness grows, so does patriotic resistance. There is strong
resistance throughout Europe to increasing the powers of the EU at the cost
of national sovereignty. In the United States, there is growing resistance
to the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement, which would eliminate
borders between the
United States, Mexico and Canada. NAFTA is to expand,
under Bilderberg-Trilateral plans, to include the entire hemisphere and
evolve into the American Union.
In the 1990s, Bilderberg was confident that the American Union would be
established by the year 2000. A decade later, they are still fightingand
losing the battle.
Bilderberg To Prolong Global Financial Recession...
For Another Year

The Bilderberg Group will meet this year in Spain and continue to advance
their agenda for world economic governance while agreeing to prolong the
global financial recession for another year, according to Bilderberg sleuth
Jim Tucker, who has discovered through his routinely accurate inside sources
that the conference will take place from June 3-6.
Bilderberg sleuths were correct in predicting that this years meeting would
take place in western Europe, but were wrong in pinpointing the UK as the
likeliest location. The 2010 conference will take place in a coastal resort
called Sitges, which is about 20 miles from Barcelona.
Bilderberg have now been absent from the UK for the longest time in their
history.
Even if Bilderberg chooses the UK as their 2011 destination, 13
years will have passed since their 1998 conference in Scotland, the longest
gap between UK conferences since the groups founding in 1954. As we
highlighted yesterday, Bilderbergs decision to avoid the UK is undoubtedly
related to increased awareness of the group and the expectation that they
would receive unwanted press attention as well as sizeable demonstrations if
they held the meeting in the British Isles.
Bilderberg last met in Spain in 1989 when they held their annual conference
on the Spanish island of La Toja.
This years confab will be similarly secluded, with Bilderbergs increasing
army of police and private security guards on hand to create a lock down of
the entire resort.
Bilderberg will have a wide choice of hotels from which to host their
secretive get-together, meaning the precise location of the conference will
be harder than ever to pin down. The area is known for having a plethora of
high standard hotels and is a popular tourist resort.
The most likely candidate however would appear to be the Hotel Dolce Sitges, a 5 star luxury resort adjacent to a prestigious golf club.
Forming the consensus which sets the agenda for global policy behind closed
doors can be stressful, which is why Bilderbergers like to interrupt their
scheming with the odd round of golf.
Business facilities include 11 meeting rooms, 25 breakout rooms, 2
boardrooms, and a spacious amphitheatre accommodating up to 60 guests. All
of the venues are equipped with the latest audiovisual technologies and
ideal for holding congresses, cocktails, weddings and any other kind of
event for up to 550 guests, states the promotional text for the hotel,
suggesting it would be ideal for the Bilderbergers.
The Hotel Dolce Sitges has no rooms available from June 2 to June 6,
strongly indicating that this is when the resort will be locked down for the
arrival of Bilderberg elitists.
The resort appears to be suitably secluded and away from the crowded tourist
areas, making it perfect for Bilderbergs needs. In addition, attempting to
book a room from June 3-6 via the hotels website reveals that no rooms are
available from June 2 to June 6, strongly indicating that this is when the
resort will be locked down for Bilderberg.
However, Bilderberg has been known to leak false information about where the
group is staying, so we cannot confirm the exact location until Jim Tucker
or Daniel Estulin pinpoint the precise location via their inside sources,
who have proven to be habitually accurate.
State of the art conference facilities and 5 star luxury suggest the Hotel
Dolce Sitges may be the preferred location for this years Bilderberg
meeting.
This years confab will focus around prolonging the global financial
recession and creating more economic woe in order to provide the pretext for
more regulation in pursuit of world economic governance, according to Jim
Tuckers sources.
Bilderberg hopes to keep the global recession going for at least a year,
according to an international financial consultant who deals personally with
many of them. This is because, among several reasons, Bilderberg still hopes
to create a global treasury department under the United Nations.
Bilderberg first undertook this mission at its meeting last spring in
Greece, but the effort was blocked by nationalists in Europe and the United
States. Nationalists (a dirty word in Bilderberg) objected to surrendering
sovereignty to the UN, writes Tucker.
Tuckers source highlighted a recent speech by French President Nicolas
Sarkozy in which he called for a new global monetary order.
As we have
highlighted, such rhetoric has been abundant over the past year, with
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and EU President Herman Van Rompuy
repeatedly echoing similar ideas.
As Bilderberg investigator Daniel Estulin revealed during last years
Bilderberg meeting in Greece, elitists were planning to paint a false
picture of economic recovery in order to sucker investors into
plugging
their money back into the stock market, which is exactly what has happened
with the Dow soaring back to just below the 11,000 level.
Estulin correctly predicted the housing crash and the 2008 financial
meltdown as a result of what his sources inside Bilderberg told him the
elite were planning based on what was said at their 2006 meeting in Canada
and the 2007 conference in Turkey.
Bilderbergs ultimate goal remains unchanged, writes Tucker.
Turn the UN
into a world government with nation-states becoming merely geographic
references. The European Union is to become a single political entity,
followed by the American Union and, finally, the Asian-Pacific Union.
The American Union is to include the entire Western Hemisphere, including
Cuba and other offshore islands.
