Hughes Aircraft
Classified projects compartment
We are in a transition in the world now. People are disgruntled with
the way conditions are but so much is based on the military economy that
it may be difficult to change. But change we must because otherwise, the
planet and the people on it will continue to suffer.
If I may make a suggestion. End this compartment and create competition with
the other airline manufacturers to lower the cost of building aircraft. That
way new planes will be built which will be safe instead of risking older planes
flying which may not be safe. In other words, no new funding for classified
projects compartment. The taxpayers cannot afford this expense any longer.
