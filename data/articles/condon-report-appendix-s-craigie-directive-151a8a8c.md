(COPY)
30 December 1947
SUBJECT: Flying Discs
-
Reference is made to three inclosures, memoranda from your office to this
headquarters, subject as above.
-
It is Air Force policy not to ignore reports of sightings and phenomena in
the atmosphere but to recognize that part of its mission is to collect,
collate, evaluate and act on information of this nature.
-
In implementing this policy, it is desired that the Air Material Command
set up a project whose purpose is to collect, collate, evaluate and
distribute to interested government agencies and contractors all
information concerning sightings and phenomena in the atmosphere which can
be construed to be of concern to the national security. It is desired that
appropriate recommendations be forwarded to this Headquarters, wherever
action is indicated which falls outside the field of the Air Material
Command.
-
It is suggested that the activities of this project include the
preparation and distribution of an initial report, as recommended in
Inclosure 1, and that subsequent reports be issued on a quarterly basis.
Supplementary reports should be issued at more frequent intervals should
the need for same be indicated. This project is assigned priority 2A, with
a security classification of "restricted" and Code Name of "SIGN". Where
data of a classification higher than restricted is handled by the project
such data should be classified accordingly. A complete interchange of data
should be effected as recommended in Inclosure 1.
