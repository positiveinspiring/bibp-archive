# Brazil Reduced to Junk as BRICs Facade Crumbles

"The numbers are going to get
much worse before they get better. We see nothing on the
horizon that could be perceived as 'good' news," said Win
Thin from Brown Brothers Harriman.
Mr. Win Thin expects the real
to reach 4.50 over the next three to six months in a cathartic
overshoot, with the
Bovespa index of equities
likely to fall by another two-fifths, testing its post-Lehman
low of 29,435 as the excesses of the credit bubble come home to
roost.
Investors have begun to shed
holdings of Brazilian debt, afraid that some funds may be forced
to eject Brazil from their indexes and liquidate holdings if a
second agency joins S&P.
Yields on 10-year domestic bonds
spiked almost one percentage point to 15.6pc in panic trading in
Sao Paolo on Thursday.
S&P said Brazil's government has
failed to get a grip on rampant over-spending as tensions erupt
between President Dilma Rousseff's Workers Party (PT) and her
coalition partners, and the economy slides into deep recession,
leaving it badly exposed as
the US Federal Reserve starts to
drain liquidity from the global economy.
"We now expect the general
government deficit to rise to an average of 8% of GDP in
2015 and 2016," it said.
Mrs Rousseff said Brazil would,
"pay
all its bills and meet all its obligations".
Yet it is unclear
how long she can last as momentum builds for impeachment over
her role in the
Petrobras corruption scandal.
Signatures were
accumulating at 30,000 an hour on the
pro-impeachment website on Thursday.
"People are sick of this
government, which has yet to offer any way out of the
crisis. It is utterly incapable of governing," said
opposition leader Mendoca Filho.
The country is now in a classic
stagflation trap. S&P expects the economy to contract by 2.5pc
this year and 0.5pc next year, causing the debt ratio to ratchet
up quickly.
Mrs Rousseff is being forced to
tighten policy into the recession in a belated bid to salvage
credibility, just as the commodity slump eats into export
revenues from iron ore and other raw materials.
The current
account deficit is 4% of GDP.
Gabriel Gersztein, from BNP Paribas,
said nothing short of a 400 to 500 point rise in rates would
stabilize the currency, but the central bank cannot plausibly do
this because it would deepen the downturn, playing havoc with
debt dynamics.
Bhanu Baweja, from UBS, said public
debt is likely to reach 72.5% of GDP by 2018 and could rise
relentlessly after that as the country passes its demographic
sweet spot and starts to age rapidly.
"The clock slowly ticks on,
asking ever louder questions about public debt
sustainability," he said.
Mr Baweja said Brazil wasted the
dividend of the commodity boom and let rip with unhealthy levels
of debt, mostly to finance a consumption bubble. Savings and
investment have been woefully low.
The country is not facing a
meltdown. Short-term external debt is trivial.
The currency has been able to take
the strain, avoiding the mistake made by Asian countries in
1997-1998 when they burned through reserves trying to defend a
dollar peg.
World bank index:
higher the score the worse it is
Nevertheless, it has made a
catalogue of errors and is now languishing in the middle income
trap.
The country ranks 120 in the World
Bank's
Ease of Doing Business index, with catastrophic scores for
infrastructure, enforcement of contracts and starting a company.
The PT has back-pedaled on reforms under Mrs Rousseff, holding
down prices artificially and tinkering with protectionism,
though the rot set in long before she took office.
Brazil fell victim to the "Dutch
Disease" during the boom, becoming dependent on commodity
exports to China, while the manufacturing base shriveled to
10% of GDP.
The real became far too strong, made
worse by a fatal policy mix: inflationary budget spending, which
the central bank had to counter with high interest rates.
The open question is whether or not
Brazil's travails imply broader EM trauma as global liquidity
tightens.
"Those countries like South
Africa, Turkey and Indonesia that have both a current
account deficit and political paralysis are in trouble, but
it is an economic problem rather than a liquidity crisis,
and you can't compare it to 1998," said Marc Chandler from
Brown Brothers Harriman.
David Rees, from Capital Economics,
said there is plenty to worry about but EM debt is mostly
long-term and in local currencies, and the commodity slump has
probably hit bottom already.
"We do not think that the
downgrade marks the beginning of a systemic emerging market
sovereign debt crisis," he said.
