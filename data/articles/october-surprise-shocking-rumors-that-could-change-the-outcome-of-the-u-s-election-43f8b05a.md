This is proving to be one of the tightest
presidential elections in U.S. history, and with less than two weeks to go
even a minor scandal could completely change the outcome of the race.
Now is the perfect time for an October surprise.
If I was an operative for either Mitt Romney or
Barack Obama, now would be
the time to unleash any big secret that you were still holding back.
Americans tend to have very short attention spans, so you wouldn't want to
reveal your October surprise too early.
But now that the debates finished,
this is the perfect opportunity to bring the hammer down. Of course our
founding fathers are probably rolling over in their graves as they watch all
this, but sadly the truth is that this is how the game of politics is played
in America today.
Veteran political operatives on both sides know
that it is either "eat or be eaten", and this election is coming right down
to the wire. One nicely timed blow from either side could make all the
difference.
Even a false rumor could change the outcome of the election if enough people
believe it. And I certainly would not rule out the possibility of operatives
on both sides floating false rumors in the coming days in an attempt to get
an edge. After the election the rumors may turn out to be entirely baseless,
but at that point nobody will be able to undo the results of the election.
Most Americans would be absolutely horrified to find out what goes on behind
the scenes in political campaigns in this day and age. A lot of political
operatives will do literally anything to win.
Of course an October surprise is even more effective if it is actually true.
And there certainly seems to be a lot of important things that the American
people do not know about Obama and Romney yet.
The following are 8 shocking rumors that could
change the outcome of the election...
Did Barack Obama Sell
Cocaine While He Was In College?
According to
RadarOnline.com, a close friend of Barack Obama during his college years
is ready to come forward with allegations that Obama sold cocaine while he
was in college...
A man claiming to be a close pal to
President Obama during college made contact with Republican operatives
recently, ready to go public with claims that Obama used and sold
cocaine in college, RadarOnline.com is reporting exclusively.
The operatives tried to spread the story
through the media and the Romney campaign, a source close to the
situation told Radar.
'At first he wanted to do a book,' a source
close to the situation told RadarOnline.com about the alleged college
pal. 'But there just wasnt enough time before the election.'
If this story is true, it could potentially be
absolutely huge. But even if it comes out now, we probably won't know
whether it is true or not until after the election.
Is Mitt Romney A Major
Investor In The Voting Machine Company
...That Made The Voting Machines That Will Count The
Votes In Ohio?
Liberal websites are going crazy
over a story that alleges that Mitt Romney and other members of his
family are "major
investors" in a voting machine company that made the voting machines
that will count the votes in Ohio on November 6th.
Well, according to
Business Insider, the truth is actually a bit more complicated than
that...
A private-equity firm that is run and
controlled largely by the Romney family, Solamere, sometimes co-invests
with a 'partner' private-equity firm, H.I.G., run by former colleagues
of Mitt Romney and key fund-raisers for the Romney campaign.
The Romney's private-equity firm, Solamere,
says it has not invested in the H.I.G. fund or entity that made the
investment in the voting machine company. But Solamere has invested in
other H.I.G. funds that are run by the same H.I.G. partners who manage
the H.I.G. entity that invested in the voting-machine company, many of
whom are former Romney colleagues and current Romney fundraisers.
So Solamere may not have a direct or
indirect investment in the voting machine company. But its partner H.I.G.
does. And the partner, H.I.G., is run by executives who actively support
the Romney campaign.
Needless to say, the truth is still very
alarming. What will people say if the voting results in Ohio are much more
favorable for Romney than anticipated?
Radical Islamists Are
Regularly Visiting The White House?
According to
the Investigative Project on Terrorism, radical Islamists have been
regularly visiting the White House during the Obama administration...
A year-long investigation by the
Investigative Project on Terrorism (IPT) has found that scores of known
radical Islamists made hundreds of visits to the Obama White House,
meeting with top administration officials.
Court documents and other records have
identified many of these visitors as belonging to groups serving as
fronts for,
The IPT made the discovery combing through
millions of White House visitor log entries.
IPT compared the visitors'
names with lists of known radical Islamists. Among the visitors were
officials representing groups which have:
-
Been designated by the Department of
Justice as unindicted co-conspirators in terrorist trials;
Extolled Islamic terrorist groups including Hamas and Hizballah
-
Obstructed terrorist investigations
by instructing their followers not to cooperate with law
enforcement
-
Promoted the incendiary
conspiratorial allegation that the United States is engaged in a
'war against Islam' -
a leading tool in recruiting Muslims to carry out acts of terror
-
Repeatedly claimed that many of the
Islamic terrorists convicted since 9-11 were framed by the U.S
government as part of an anti-Muslim profiling campaign

A Spanish Company Will Be
Counting Many Of Our Votes?
As I have reported
previously, a Spanish company known as Scytl will be involved in
reporting election results for hundreds of jurisdictions across the United
States on election day.
According
to WND, there are serious concerns about the security of Scytl
software...
Just prior to the midterms, Washington,
D.C., tested its own new electronic-voting system and discovered it had
been hacked.
As a program security trial, the D.C. Board
of Elections and Ethics reportedly encouraged outside parties to hack
and find flaws in its new online balloting system.
A group of University of Michigan students
then hacked into the site and commanded it to play the schools fight
song upon casting a vote.
The state of Florida has also found
vulnerabilities in Scytl software...
Project Vote noted that in 2008, the Florida
Department of State commissioned a review of SCYTLs remote voting
software and concluded, in part, that:
-
The system is vulnerable to attack
from insiders
-
In a worst case scenario, the
software could lead to,
-
voters being unable to cast
votes
-
an election that does not
accurately reflect the will of the voters
-
possible disclosure of
confidential information, such as the votes cast by
individual voters
-
The system may be subject to attacks
that could compromise the integrity of the votes cast
So will these vulnerabilities by exploited on
November 6th?
Allegations Of Voter Fraud On
Both Sides
As I wrote about
the other day, both the Democrats and the Republicans have already been
accused of committing voter fraud.
Down
in Florida, voters are receiving letters in the mail questioning their
citizenship and instructing them not to vote...
Voters are getting letters that look like
they are from local elections offices, questioning their citizenship.
But Local 6 has learned the letters are fake, and they are going out
across Central Florida and many other parts of the state.
Officials on Monday said voters who had
received the letters thus far are white, registered Republicans who
consistently vote in elections.
'This is a major concern,' said Seminole
County Supervisor of Elections Mike Ertel, who received a letter
from a voter mailed from Seattle with no return address.
'You should not expect a letter from
your elections office saying, "You're not registered to vote, please
don't go to the polls." That's ridiculous.'
On Tuesday, the state of Florida said there
have been reports from more than 20 counties where voters have received
fraudulent letters impersonating supervisors of elections.

around the nation, please see this article: "Are
Operatives From Both Parties Systematically Committing Election Fraud?"
Threats Of Violence If Romney
Wins
Over the past few weeks, Obama supporters have been
flooding social media with threats that they will riot in the streets of
our major cities if Romney wins.
Many have even been threatening direct physical violence
against Mitt Romney himself if Romney wins the election.
Of course if these threats were being made against Obama, the mainstream
media would be having an absolute field day with them. But because they are
being made against Mitt Romney they are being ignored.
To see some of the most disturbing threats against Mitt Romney on Twitter,
please see
this article. But be warned that some of the foul language used
in these threats is extremely strong.
It is absolutely mind blowing that the mainstream media is ignoring these
threats which continue to endlessly pour in every single day.
Are they also going to ignore the rioting and violence that erupt once
Romney wins?
An October Surprise From
Gloria Allred?
RadarOnline.com is reporting that Gloria Allred is heading to court in
an attempt to dig up some dirt on Mitt Romney...
Famed civil rights attorney Gloria Allred
will be in a Boston area courtroom Wednesday in an attempt to unseal the
sworn testimony given by Republican Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, in
a prior court case, RadarOnline.com is exclusively reporting.
'The Boston Globe is headed to court
tomorrow morning for an emergency hearing in an attempt to obtain a
court order to unseal the sworn testimony given by Mitt Romney in a
prior court case and to lift a gag order so that the parties can speak
about Romney. Gloria Allred will be in court representing one of the
parties in the case,' a source close to the situation tells
RadarOnline.com.
Could Gloria Allred once again change the course
of an election?
An October Surprise From
Donald Trump?
The Daily Mail
is reporting that Donald Trump is about to reveal some divorce papers
that show that Barack Obama and his wife Michelle were once close to
divorce...
Donald Trump is to claim that he has
unearthed divorce papers of Michelle Obama and the President, according
to a respected financial pundit with links to the tycoon.
It is alleged that the eccentric real estate
mogul will claim that the documents show the First Lady and the
President were at one point in their two decades of marriage seriously
considering splitting up.
Trump set the hare running on Monday by
claiming that he was set to make an announcement on Wednesday that would
be bordering on gigantic' and that it would possibly change the
Presidential race.
So what do you think about all these rumors?
Do you have any to add to the list?
