An article in National Geographic from September
1972 regarding the then newly-formed nation of Bangladesh illustrates how
little the world's situation has changed over the past 30+ years.
The story of Bangladesh is simply appalling.
It begins centuries ago, with the Bengali people
being murderously ping-ponged back and forth by whatever forces trudged
across their path. While at one point Bangladesh - an area roughly the size
of the American state of Wisconsin and surrounded by India, with Pakistan on
the west, Nepal and Bhutan to the north, and Burma/Myanmar on the east - was
largely composed of Hindus and Buddhists, in 1202 it was invaded and bent
under the sword of Islam by the Turkomans.
After the horrendous disaster in November 1970
of a cyclone and tsunami wiped out an estimated 600,000 people, in 1972
civil war erupted after minority Urdu-speaking Pakistanis attempted
officially to impose their rule over the far more populous Bengalis. The
atrocities that followed included not only an estimated 3 million deaths but
also approximately 200,000 rapes, vicious acts that created thousands of
unwanted pregnancies and tremendous disgrace for the women involved.
Despite these casualties and the millions of refugees by the hand of man and
God, it was estimated in 1972 that 75 million people remained in Bangladesh,
a density of 1,300 individuals per square mile, in a country of just 55,126
square miles and comprising the 8th largest population in the world. At that
time, it was also estimated that the population would double within 30
years.
By 2005, there were some 144 million inhabitants
of Bangladesh.
At the nation's formation, the per capita income was under
$80 per year. Despite fervent hopes and strides made through countless
donations comprising hundreds of millions of dollars, Bangladesh remains one
of the poorest nations in the world. Its people work themselves to the bone
at everything from farming to bike-cab driving to milling and jute-working.
Its factories are jam-packed with exhausted and
thin workers. And laboring children can never be exempt in the quest to keep
their families fed. Also, the Bengali economy depends largely on floods that
take a certain amount of casualties so the land can be replenished and the
majority may live at least a bit longer.
The National Geographic article of November 1972 calls what happened to the
Bengalis a "Holocaust," addressing the mind-numbing mayhem and horror that
decimated villages and left mass graves for all to see. At this time, art
became filled with bloody images of murder and rape; even children were
encouraged in drawing contests to chronicle these horrors.
This section in the Geographic states:
"Sheik Mujib's government says that three
million Bengalis died between March and December 1971. The figure is
probably inflated. But certainly the terrors and atrocities committed
here - in Dacca [Dhaka] and all across the gentle land of rivers and
marshlands - came close to genocide."
Before its blood-soaked independence - what
independence has not been blood-soaked?
Bangladesh was part of Pakistan, a nation
created on two sides of India, one West and one East. The West Pakistanis
would not give up East Pakistan, even though the Urdu-speaking West
Pakistanis constituted only 5% of the population of Bangladesh. West
Pakistan subsequently unleashed another wave of violence against a people
whose pre-Muslim Hindu roots remained, exemplified by their normally
pacifistic behavior.
It is clear that had not these people been
decimated in the 13th century under the hue and cry of "convert or die!" by
members of the "Religion of Peace," they would have remained Hindu or
Buddhist.
Hypocritical Faith
Among the victims of the "ruthless campaign [of West Pakistan] to suppress
the rebellious Bengalis" were intellectuals, political leaders and Hindus,
"considered agents of India." In the midst of this horror, caused by Muslims
ostensibly led by Allah, the victims sank to their knees begging mercy from
the same Merciful Allah, carrying amulets containing verses from the Koran.
The pathetic irony of the situation should be as
obvious as that of the
Christian Crusades, which employed both professionals
and amateurs to massacre entire towns of equally Christian people in their
ill-founded quest to conquer the "Holy Land" and secure it from the
"infidels."
As reported by National Geographic, the number of Bengali women raped during
this most irreligious orgy of viciousness and violence was officially
estimated at 200,000.
Says the Geographic:
"As with most government statistics having
to do with war, the number of alleged victims - 200,000 - may be
exaggerated."
It is important to note that it is considered
"good reporting" to mention the exaggeration of the numbers involved in the
Bengali "Holocaust" - to use National Geographic's term - of poor people in
the East, while such a doubtful remark regarding
the sacrosanct Western
"Holocaust" can land a person in prison in several "civilized" countries.
The Bengalis apparently do not share the
irrational view forced upon the West that the attempted genocide of only one
particular group, to the exclusion of the rest, may be termed "Holocaust,"
as the Bengalis themselves possess their own "Holocaust Museum."
Through no fault of their own, and under the eyes of the Merciful Allah,
tens of thousands of Bengali women - violently and viciously raped by men
claiming to be devoutly religious Muslims - were subsequently considered
disgraces who had dishonored their equally devout Muslim families, and were
shunned or worse.
The Urdu-speaking Pakistanis in Bangladesh ("Biharis") fared little better,
as they were forced out of their homes and jobs into foul refugee camps and
given no assistance from the overlord West Pakistanis who incited them to
fight in the first place, serving as another example of man's capacity for
injustice and treachery.
In the midst of this mess, a primitive prehistoric tribe called the "Murungs"
("Mros" or "Moorangs") managed to maintain itself. Their only wish was to be
"left in peace, to follow the old traditions."
As concerns
the Moorangs, Geographic states:
"The Murungs fish a little in the lake. They
farm, too, using the ancient slash-and-burn method of agriculture,
planting seeds in hillside soil enriched with the rain-soaked ash of
burnt brush. Though they believe in spirits, they have no well-defined
religion, maintaining that the scriptures they were meant to follow were
written on banana leaves, and that the leaves were eaten by a cow."
Thus, a simple cow has prevented these decidedly
docile and peace-loving people from following the way of fiery zealots who
believe in set "scriptures" as the very words or Word of God, such
that their beliefs drive them to slaughter, rape and pillage other living,
breathing beings in the name of their religion and God.
The relaxed and happy Moorangs seem to have the
right idea, thanks to the cow, who showed them that life itself was more
valuable than banana-leaf "God-given" scriptures.
If the rest of the world were so enlightened, peace would finally be within
our grasp.
Alas, it may never be the case, as "religious"
derangement continues to infect the human brain and cause its fervent
believers to wantonly murder living, feeling human beings in order to
protect "scriptures" better left to the cows.
