# EU Wants to Intercept Encrypted VOIP Communications

Italian authorities are taking the initiative in a European Union (EU)-wide
effort to terminate the tacit immunity of Voice-Over-Internet-Protocol (VOIP)
communications from authorized interception.
Italys delegation to Eurojust,
an EU coordination body tasked with combating transnational organized crime,
issued a statement last weekend, promising to spearhead a project to,
overcome the technical and judicial obstacles to the interception of
internet telephony systems.
The statement contains several references to Skype, a Luxembourg-based VOIP provider that has so far reportedly refused
to share its communications encryption system with government authorities.
Because of this, the latter have accused Skype of providing organized crime
syndicates with the ability to communicate without fear of their messages
being intercepted.
There is some evidence that criminal and militant groups are switching to
VOIP communications to coordinate their operations. In November of 2008, the
Pakistani militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba,
used VOIP software to communicate
with the Mumbai attackers on the ground and direct the large-scale operation
on a real-time basis.
The distinguishing feature of VOIP-based communications, which form the
technical basis of popular communications software, such as Skype and Vonage,
is that audio signals are converted to data and travel through most of the
Internet infrastructure in binary, rather than audio, format. Furthermore,
they are sometimes encrypted using algorithms of various strengths.
Additionally, VOIP data packets often travel through Internet networks
looking for unused lines, which may not necessarily be the shortest route to
their destination. Consequently, a VOIP source signal from New York to Los
Angeles could easily reach its destination through, say, Reykjavik or
Bogota. What is more, binary data packets often split, with different parts
following different routes to a given destination and only reuniting at a
switch close to the end destination.
This poses severe barriers to
communications interception, as well as to the ability of law enforcement
and intelligence agencies to locate the source of target calls.
Companies like Skype point to the technical complexities of VOIP
communications and argue that it is often technically impossible to
facilitate communications interception requests by government authorities.
Skype in particular says it has repeatedly briefed EU law enforcement
agencies about these technical barriers, and that its policy is to cooperate
with government interception requests where legally and technically
possible.
Technical issues aside, those in the know are aware of ongoing efforts by
intelligence agencies to bypass Internet service providers altogether,
concentrating instead on intercepting VOIP messages at the user end. Earlier
this month, reports emerged that German authorities are using malicious
software installed surreptitiously on targeted computers to capture the
content of VOIP-based communications.
In January, the EU prompted European
law enforcement agencies
to resort to computer hacking (termed remote
searching in official documents) in order to combat cyber crime. Britains
Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) admitted that British law
enforcement and intelligence agencies already conduct a small number of
such operations every year.
In 2008, remote searching was employed during,
194 clandestine searches [...] of peoples homes, offices and hotel
bedrooms, ACPO said.
More recently, an anonymous industry insider alleged
that the US National Security Agency (NSA) is actively soliciting several
companies in its search for a way out of the technical challenges posed by
Skypes strong encryption and peer-to-peer network architecture.
The unnamed
source claimed that NSA is,
offering billions to any firm which can offer
reliable eavesdropping on Skype IM and voice traffic [...]. They are saying
to the industry, you get us into Skype and we will make you a very rich
company, said the source.
If accurate, these allegations show that initiatives such as the one by
Eurojust, above, which aim at establishing operational interfaces between
law enforcement, intelligence and telecommunications organizations, are
simply one facet of a broader effort to intercept VOIP communications.
While
reaching out to VOIP providers, European and American intelligence agencies
are simultaneously engaged in projects -often of dubious legality- to
circumvent these providers altogether, focusing instead on end-point
eavesdropping.
These attempts will continue for as long as encrypted,
peer-to-peer VOIP remains an attractive option for consumers.
Has Skypes VOIP Encryption Been Broken?

I have explained before that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and other
intelligence agencies have found it impossible to intercept Skypes instant
messaging and voice traffic.
Like other voice-over-Internet protocol (VOIP)
communications providers, Skype uses technology that converts audio signals
to data, and transports them through most of the Internet infrastructure in
binary, rather than audio, format. Furthermore, Skype uses very complex
algorithms to encrypt its customers communications.
Skype has repeatedly
pointed to the technical complexities of VOIP communications, arguing that
it is often technically impossible to facilitate communications interception
requests by government authorities.
There are rumors among communications
interception specialists that the NSA is offering billions to anyone who can
come up with a reliable eavesdropping model for Skype.
Remarkably, on August
25, a Swiss software developer released what he claims is
the source code of
a program for tapping into encrypted Skype communications. I dont know
whether the source code (essentially a trojan) is effective.
He claims it
is. If this is confirmed, then several people in Fort George F. Meade,
Maryland, will be really close paying attention.
