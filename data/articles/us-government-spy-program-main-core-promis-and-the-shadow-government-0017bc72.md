Over the last two weeks I have encountered just such an apocalyptic
situation, where I and the Department of Justice have been asked to be part
of something that is fundamentally wrong.
(Excerpt from Deputy Attorney
General James Comeys
draft letter of resignation to President Bush, dated
March 16, 2004, which Comey did not in the end send.)
"Nothing was your own except the few cubic
centimeters inside your skull"
(George Orwell:
1984)
I: Main Core and PROMIS
Suppose that the United States Government, or more likely an unaccountable
privatized intelligence colossus empowered by the reaction to the 9/11
attacks and fueled by the rampant cronyism of a system long ago gone rotten
had a surveillance tool capable of peering into the most private aspects of
American lives on a whim.
Now suppose that the new growth industry of a
previously unthinkable futuristic police state was already in place, fully
operational and has been online and has actively been being utilized for
domestic spying for years before those two
airplanes slammed into the World
Trade Center.
The 'terrorist' attacks were used as the justification for
every unconstitutional reigning in of civil liberties ever since that
heinous September morning seven years ago when the reset button was hit on
two and a quarter centuries of American history and we all stepped forth
into the brave new world of perpetual war, fear, suspicion and vengeance
into a parallel reality in a place that would come to be known as The
Homeland.
What if this surveillance industrial complex was in possession of
a database that was so large and so powerful that not only could it
instantly process and retrieve the most minute or intimate aspects of a
citizens lives but was also able to utilize extremely sophisticated
artificial intelligence capabilities to actually predict likely patterns of
future behavior.
Such a huge database would be able to use cutting edge technology funded
with taxpayer dollars and awarded to unaccountable private corporations
largely through business as usual no bid contracts to create the most
invasive tool of oppression this country has ever seen. This database would
rely on software that was capable of performing
social network analysis
based on
block modeling technology to monitor all forms of electronic
communications, all internet searches, all debit and credit card
transactions, all travel arrangements, all library records, all bank
activity and all telephone records.
It would then be able to use the data to
not only find links between persons who already know and interact with each
other but to categorize each individual into a particular group that possess
similar behavioral and purchasing habits. These groups could then be further
divided into subgroups and further analyzed in order to determine under some
loosely defined and largely unknown guidelines whether they could
potentially represent a threat.
While all of this may sound like some sort
of futuristic dystopian nightmare straight out of Philip K. Dicks Minority
Report and "Precrime" it is very real and it goes by the name of
Main Core.
For example, if you are selling a bicycle and run an advertisement in your
local newspaper and you happen to receive a call from a Muhammad who is
interested in your bicycle and Muhammad happens to have certain friends who
have relationships with an organization that is determined by some unknown
criteria to be a potential terrorist organization then the call that you
received from Muhammad would then in all likelihood place you in the
database and subject to an increased level of scrutiny at best and at worst
in jeopardy of being picked up and held indefinitely without any sort of
judicial review.
This technology is being used today absent any form of legitimate oversight,
with a Constitution that has been eviscerated by the Bush-Cheney-Rove Axis
of Evil, a vast gulag network of top secret prisons and 'detention
facilities' and the decidedly anti-American new phenomenon of state
sanctioned torture.
Throw in an overworked, systematically dumbed-down
populace that has been propagandized by the corrupt institution that is the
corporate media machine with it's clever use of fear and loathing and
scientific development of advanced mind control techniques who despite the
infinite wisdom of our forefathers would gladly sacrifice their liberty for
the any sort of temporary safety (no matter that it is fleeting) and there
exists today in 'The Homeland' a perfect Petri-dish for an authoritarian
fascist society.
It is though a very sophisticated form of fascism unlike more outwardly
obvious regimes that we have known in the past.
Author Bertram Gross
published a book back in 1980 that was entitled
Friendly Fascism, Jim
Garrison once said that "fascism would come to America in the name of
national security", and author Kevin Phillips in his 1983 book
Post-Conservative America warned of the potential of an "apple pie
authoritarianism" and a coming society in which:
"the Star Spangled Benner
would wave with greater frequency and over many more parades; increased
surveillance would crack down on urban outbreaks and extreme political
dissidents".
This very accurately describes post 9/11 America where any
semblance of reason has been abandoned for cheap flag-waving pimped off as
patriotism, criticism of authority has made into potential treason by the
highly paid shills for neoconservative doctrine, sloganeering and
demagoguery have replaced discourse, critical thinking is becoming extinct
and just as George Orwell so accurately predicted
Big Brother is now
watching over us, protecting us and ensuring that we understand that war is
peace, freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength.
But I digress...
Main Core has received attention in two 2008 articles, one a piece by
investigative journalist Christopher Ketcham entitled
The Last Roundup
(which also looks at
Continuity of Government programs but more on that in a
little while) and Tim Shorrock entitled
Exposing Bushs Historic Abuse of
Power. Both articles tie Main Core to the now legendary
PROMIS software, an
extremely advanced program designed to aid federal prosecutors in case
management tracking. PROMIS could pull and put together a wide range of data
from disparate sources into a single record.
The PROMIS software was created
by
INSLAW Inc., a company owned by a former NSA intelligence officer named
William Hamilton. PROMIS was to have been licensed to the U.S. government in
the early 1980s before the technology boom became widespread but was then
stolen by the seamy officials in Ronald Reagans Justice Department.
The
software was modified for espionage purposes to include a back door that
could be used for spying on those that it was sold to and in a detail that
should be especially relevant with the economic crisis that threatens to
crash the global financial system, the software could also be used to track
in real time (in order to manipulate?) stock market transactions, once can
certainly speculate as to how such a tool could have contributed to an
economic catastrophe as we are now facing if it were used for such a thing.
It is important to keep in mind the period when
PROMIS was stolen in the
early 1980's and the fact that the technology boom was still years in the
future which should give one an idea to just how far advanced and therefore
how important that it was to those who would use it in order to promote a
sinister agenda.
Mr. Shorock's piece goes into the relationship between PROMIS and Main Core
in some detail:
According to William Hamilton, a former NSA intelligence
officer who left the agency in the 1970s, that description sounded a lot
like Main Core, which he first heard about in detail in 1992.
Hamilton, who
is the president of Inslaw Inc., a computer services firm with many clients
in government and the private sector, says there are strong indications that
the Bush administration's domestic surveillance operations use Main Core.
Hamilton's company Inslaw is widely respected in the law enforcement
community for creating a program called the Prosecutors' Management
Information System, or PROMIS. It keeps track of criminal investigations
through a powerful search engine that can quickly access all stored data
components of a case, from the name of the initial investigators to the
telephone numbers of key suspects.
PROMIS, also widely used in the insurance
industry, can also sort through other databases fast, with results showing
up almost instantly.
"It operates just like Google," Hamilton told me in an
interview in his Washington office in May.
Since the late 1980s, Inslaw has been involved in a legal dispute over its
claim that Justice Department officials in the Reagan administration
appropriated the PROMIS software. Hamilton claims that Reagan officials gave
PROMIS to the NSA and the CIA, which then adapted the software - and its
outstanding ability to search other databases - to manage intelligence
operations and track financial transactions.
Over the years, Hamilton has
employed prominent lawyers to pursue the case, including Elliot Richardson,
the former attorney general and secretary of defense who died in 1999, and
C. Boyden Gray, the former White House counsel to President George H.W.
Bush. The dispute has never been settled. But based on the long-running
case, Hamilton says he believes U.S. intelligence uses PROMIS as the primary
software for searching the Main Core database.
Hamilton was first told about the connection between PROMIS and Main Core in
the spring of 1992 by a U.S. intelligence official, and again in 1995 by a
former NSA official.
In July 2001, Hamilton says, he discussed his case with
retired Adm. Dan Murphy, a former military advisor to Elliot Richardson who
later served under President George H.W. Bush as deputy director of the CIA.
Murphy, who died shortly after his meeting with Hamilton, did not
specifically mention Main Core.
But he informed Hamilton that the NSA's use
of PROMIS involved something,
"so seriously wrong that money alone cannot
cure the problem," Hamilton told me. He added, "I believe in retrospect that
Murphy was alluding to
Main Core."
Hamilton also provided copies of letters
that Richardson and Gray sent to U.S. intelligence officials and the Justice
Department on Inslaw's behalf alleging that the NSA and the CIA had
appropriated PROMIS for intelligence use.
Hamilton says James B. Comey's congressional testimony in May 2007, in which
he described a hospitalized John Ashcroft's dramatic standoff with senior
Bush officials Alberto Gonzales and Andrew Card, was another illuminating
moment.
"It was then that we [at Inslaw] started hearing again about the
Main Core derivative of PROMIS for spying on Americans," he told me.
Through a former senior Justice Department official with more than 25 years
of government experience, Salon has learned of a high-level former national
security official who reportedly has firsthand knowledge of the U.S.
government's use of Main Core. The official worked as a senior intelligence
analyst for a large domestic law enforcement agency inside the Bush White
House. He would not agree to an interview.
But according to the former
Justice Department official, the former intelligence analyst told her that
while stationed at the White House after the 9/11 attacks, one day he
accidentally walked into a restricted room and came across a computer system
that was logged on to what he recognized to be the Main Core database.
When
she mentioned the specific name of the top-secret system during their
conversation, she recalled,
"He turned white as a sheet."
An article in Radar magazine in May, citing three unnamed former government
officials, reported that,
"8 million Americans are now listed in Main Core as
potentially suspect" and, in the event of a national emergency, "could be
subject to everything from heightened surveillance and tracking to direct
questioning and even detention."
The INSLAW/PROMIS story reached deep into the darkest bowels of an
increasingly secretive and malevolent
National Security State that had
manifested itself in,
-
the Reagan administration
-
the arms for hostages October
Surprise deal that sank Jimmy Carter's bid for
re-election leading to the Reagan-Bush hostile takeover of America
-
Iran-Contra,
BCCI, media
manipulation (see Robert Parrys excellent special report for Consortium
News entitled
Iran Contras 'lost chapter')
-
Oliver Norths swashbuckling
adventures with C.O.G.,
drugs for guns and subversion of Congress all were
components of Reagans government, a government that he hypocritically
railed against for its intrusiveness and yet presided over while the shadow
government that would rise again with the Supreme Court installation of
George W. Bush as president with many of the key operatives of Reagan and
George H.W.
Bushs dark shops of oppression being given key positions in
this brazenly lawless administration that has brought America to the brink
of fascism. Many of these hard-liners remain in place throughout the
bureaucracy in order to do whatever is necessary to preserve the power of
the shadow government.
Ketcham's The Last Roundup is particularly of interest in that he examines
the now infamous 2004 visit of Bush administration officials Alberto
Gonzalez and Andrew Card to the hospital room of Attorney General John
Ashcroft who had been stricken with pancreatitis after acting A.G. James
Comey refused to sign off on the reauthorization of what was an illegal
surveillance program related to Continuity of Government.
The story is
fascinating in that it not only illustrated the length to which the
Bush-Cheney junta would go to in order to keep their dirty little programs
in place but also for the high speed chase through the streets of Washington
and the race up the hospital stairs that Comey engaged in to beat Gonzalez
and Card to the sedated Ashcroft to take advantage of a sick man, when John
Ashcroft actually comes out looking like a heroic figure it becomes very
apparent of just how grossly un-American that this flagrantly criminal
administration truly is.
James Comey went on to give testimony to Congress
over
the hospital room showdown and more details are available from blogger
Glenn Greenwald in his piece entitled
What illegal "things" was the
government doing in 2001-2004? and in Barton Gellman's book
Angler and
excerpts were published in the Washington Post which
part one and
part two
can be read for more information on the back story behind the surveillance
reauthorization.
Murray Waas also has done a story on whether former
Attorney General Gonzalez
created a set of falsified notes to provide a
cover story for what occurred while trying to bully Comey and Ashcroft into
signing off on the obviously illegal surveillance program.
Excerpts from Ketcham's story are chilling:
According to a senior government official who served with high-level
security clearances in five administrations,
"There exists a database of
Americans, who, often for the slightest and most trivial reason, are
considered unfriendly, and who, in a time of panic, might be incarcerated.
The database can identify and locate perceived 'enemies of the state' almost
instantaneously."
He and other sources tell Radar that the database is
sometimes referred to by the code name Main Core. One knowledgeable source
claims that 8 million Americans are now listed in Main Core as potentially
suspect. In the event of a national emergency, these people could be subject
to everything from heightened surveillance and tracking to direct
questioning and possibly even detention.
Of course, federal law is somewhat vague as to what might constitute a
"national emergency."
Executive orders issued over the past three decades
define it as a,
"natural disaster, military attack, [or] technological or
other emergency," while Department of Defense documents include
eventualities like "riots, acts of violence, insurrections, unlawful
obstructions or assemblages, [and] disorder prejudicial to public law and
order."
According to one news report, even "national opposition to U.S.
military invasion abroad" could be a trigger.
Let's imagine a harrowing scenario: coordinated bombings in several American
cities culminating in a major blastsay, a suitcase nukein New York City.
Thousands of civilians are dead. Commerce is paralyzed. A state of emergency
is declared by the president. Continuity of Governance plans that were
developed during the Cold War and aggressively revised since 9/11 go into
effect.
Surviving government officials are shuttled to protected underground
complexes carved into the hills of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.
Power shifts to a "parallel government" that consists of scores of secretly pre-selected officials. (As far back as the 1980s,
Donald Rumsfeld, then CEO
of a pharmaceutical company, and Dick Cheney, then a congressman from
Wyoming, were slated to step into key positions during a declared
emergency.)
The executive branch is the sole and absolute seat of authority,
with Congress and the judiciary relegated to advisory roles at best. The
country becomes, within a matter of hours, a police state.
And
Under law, during a national emergency,
FEMA and its parent organization,
the Department of Homeland Security, would be empowered to seize private and
public property, all forms of transport, and all food supplies. The agency
could dispatch military commanders to run state and local governments, and
it could order the arrest of citizens without a warrant, holding them
without trial for as long as the acting government deems necessary.
From the
comfortable perspective of peaceful times, such behavior by the government
may seem far-fetched. But it was not so very long ago that FDR ordered
120,000 Japanese Americanseveryone from infants to the elderlybe held in
detention camps for the duration of World War II. This is widely regarded as
a shameful moment in U.S. history, a lesson learned.
But a long trail of
federal documents indicates that the possibility of large-scale detention
has never quite been abandoned by federal authorities. Around the time of
the 1968 race riots, for instance, a paper drawn up at the U.S. Army War
College detailed plans for rounding up millions of "militants" and "American
negroes," who were to be held at "assembly centers or relocation camps."
In
the late 1980s, the Austin American-Statesman and other publications
reported the existence of 10 detention camp sites on military facilities
nationwide, where hundreds of thousands of people could be held in the event
of domestic political upheaval. More such facilities were commissioned in
2006, when Kellogg Brown & Rootthen a subsidiary of Halliburtonwas handed
a $385 million contract to establish "temporary detention and processing
capabilities" for the Department of Homeland Security.
The contract is short
on details, stating only that the facilities would be used for,
"an emergency
influx of immigrants, or to support the rapid development of new programs."
Just what those "new programs" might be is not specified.
In the days after our hypothetical terror attack, events might play out like
this: With the population gripped by fear and anger, authorities undertake
unprecedented actions in the name of public safety. Officials at the
Department of Homeland Security begin actively scrutinizing people whofor a
tremendously broad set of reasonshave been flagged in Main Core as
potential domestic threats.
Some of these individuals might receive a letter
or a phone call, others a request to register with local authorities. Still
others might hear a knock on the door and find police or armed soldiers
outside. In some instances, the authorities might just ask a few questions.
Other suspects might be arrested and escorted to federal holding facilities,
where they could be detained without counsel until the state of emergency is
no longer in effect.
Despite the departure of the Bush regime, martial law is a very serious
possibility with it having now been established that the executive branch
can exercise dictatorial powers during a "catastrophic emergency" (as put
forth in the Bush administration's
NSPD-51) which is defined as,
"any
incident, regardless of location, that results in extraordinary levels of
mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the U.S.
population, infrastructure, environment, economy or government functions".
With events unfolding as they currently are it is especially troubling to
note that the "economy" is one of the criteria that would trigger the
declaration of martial law, the current economic crisis along with the lack
of will to do what it takes to make corrections rather than bailing out and
essentially giving amnesty to the Wall Street looters who are responsible
for it only guarantees that the collapse when it does come will be much more
devastating.
An
article in The Army Times that was published last fall
reveals that as of October troop deployments will include 'Homeland' duty
under the command of
NORTHCOM. Assignments will allow for an
increased
public visibility (translation: getting Americans used to seeing troops on
the streets) and will have a stated purpose as follows:
"They may be called
upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially
horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a
chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or high-yield explosive, or CBRNE, attack."
If action by the military (and the unaccountable mercenaries
from privatized 'security' firms like
Blackwater) is decided to be merited
by the unitary executive and a state of martial law declared then what
exactly is going to happen to those "8 million" names that Ketcham writes of
as "potentially suspect" who are in the Main Core database?
That Main Core and PROMIS are linked raises some extremely provocative
questions in regards to intent on the subversion of the Constitution and the
overthrow of the legitimate government by
a shadow government using the
Continuity of Government infrastructure.
Ketcham also references a massive
1993 piece for Wired Magazine entitled
The INSLAW Octopus that none other
than the infamous rogue operative Lt. Col. Oliver North was using PROMIS for
illegal surveillance purposes:
Lt. Col. Oliver North also may have been using the program. According to
several intelligence community sources, PROMIS was in use at a
6,100-square-foot command center built on the sixth floor of the Justice
Department. According to both a contractor who helped design the center and
information disclosed during the Iran-Contra hearings, Oliver North had a
similar, but smaller, White House operations room that was connected by
computer link to the DOJ's command center.
Using the computers in his command center, North tracked dissidents and
potential troublemakers within the United States as part of a domestic
emergency preparedness program, commissioned under Reagan's Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), according to sources and published
reports. Using PROMIS, sources point out, North could have drawn up lists of
anyone ever arrested for a political protest, for example, or anyone who had
ever refused to pay their taxes.
Compared to PROMIS, Richard Nixon's enemies
list or Sen. Joe McCarthy's blacklist look downright crude. This operation
was so sensitive that when Rep. Jack Brooks asked North about it during the
Iran-Contra hearings, the hearing was immediately suspended pending an
executive (secret) conference. When the hearings were reconvened, the issue
of North's FEMA dealings was dropped.
Norths involvement with Continuity of Government programs including REX 84
has long been known and while Col. North no longer is active in such
programs (at least not to the knowledge of anyone) a larger part of the
C.O.G./shadow government infrastructure continued to breed in darkness and
secrecy and on that most glorious day for American fascism, 9/11/2001 went
live under the guidance of one of its most ardent and longtime architects,
former Vice President Richard B. Cheney.
The secrets of Main Core, PROMIS and other variations of the monstrous tools
of an out of control shadow government are the veritable crown jewels of the
police state and every effort has and will continue to be vigorously
employed to stifle any investigations through the official channels.
Is
there really any doubt that these surveillance systems aren't being used for
raw political purposes and for blackmail? How much serious opposition did
the Bush-Cheney-Rove Axis of Evil meet in their systematic dismantling of
the Constitution over the past eight years? How much of it will the Obama
administration undo?
In the ongoing exploitation of the 'terrorist' attacks
of 9/11 that have been used to justify each and every incursion on American
civil liberties and thugs like Dick Cheney and David Addington acting as the
muscle for the shadow government (as is evident in the stories linked to
above) the footfalls of those little cat feet grow louder and louder.
Now if PROMIS was being used by Colonel North as a part of Rex 84 back in
the 1980's when the Continuity of Government plans were being tweaked, FEMA
being set up for the eventual incorporation into the Department of Homeland
Security and financial transactions as well as communications already being
monitored what does that say about the current state in which we all find
ourselves in?
Every new police state measure has been implemented largely
after being conceived in secrecy under the premise of 'national security'
and NSPD-51 has allowed for the executive branch to issue a declaration of
martial law under which the
roundup of dissidents for detention (or worse)
will be conducted. And this has all been non-reviewable by Congress, a
supposedly (at least according to the Constitution) a co-equal branch of
government.
When a Congressman named Peter DeFazio was last year
denied
access to the NSPD-51/C.O.G. plans by the Bush administration it was yet
another example of what has been a disturbing pattern.
The Main Core list of
potential 'enemies of the state', the assignment of troops to NORTHCOM, the
ongoing frantic efforts of the neocons to launch a war with Iran, the threat
of the Cheney cabal being further exposed, the deteriorating economy and the
growing public anger at government along with a loss of faith in public
institutions all add up to something very dark that is about to come to
fruition after decades of planning.
None of this is about terrorism at all, it never has been. It is all about
the implementation of a fascist style dictatorship in America.
It is
imperative that it be brought to light now that there is a window of
opportunity and a new administration, the police state and the illegal
surveillance system must be dismantled and our intelligence system be put
under honest and principled oversight.

"In a very real and terrifying sense, our Government is the CIA and the
Pentagon, with Congress reduced to a debating society. Of course, you can't
spot this trend to fascism by casually looking around. You can't look for
such familiar signs as the swastika, because they won't be there.
We won't
build Dachaus and Auschwitzes; the clever
manipulation of the mass media is
creating a concentration camp of the mind that promises to be far more
effective in keeping the populace in line."
-Earling Carothers 'Jim' Garrison
I: The Shadow Government
To say that the
'terrorist' attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon
were an incredible boon to the shadow government and its long running agenda
would be quite the understatement. Never before in American history has this
particular element been so visible and brazen than in the aftermath of 9/11
which has since become the ultimate trump card to be played against the
forces of reason, judiciousness and the rule of law.
The frenzied spree to
dismantle the republic and reinterpret the Constitution to implement the
fascist police state that would suppress the domestic populace while the
business of expanding the empire abroad has gone on unabated for over seven
years now.
The ascendance of the shadow government into the open began on
that morning and the events have been instrumental in allowing for every
outrageous violation of civil liberties, international law and the very
bedrock principle upon which civilized societies are built being habeas
corpus. America is now known worldwide as a torture state, a pariah and a
rogue nation to be hated and feared and is ruled by an imperial presidency
or as it is formerly known a
Unitary Executive (translation: dictator).
The
current state of affairs are primarily due to the policies of the cabal of
one Richard B. Cheney, the most powerful Vice President in history as well
as a longtime shadow government figure who
activated Continuity of
Government on the morning of 9/11.
Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld who have been collaborators in a war against the
basic tenets of American Constitutional democracy since their days together
in the Ford administration were active participants in Continuity of
Government throughout the Reagan years and afterwards. With C.O.G. being
highly secretive it is not widely known due to a lack of official media
coverage of the programs so few questions have been asked, no oversight
exists and it has been a useful place for a renegade cabal with an acute
distaste for democratic principles.
One of the most often referenced pieces
on this was James Mann's 2004 piece for the Atlantic Magazine entitled
The
Armageddon Plan.
Another shadow government figure who would later become
instrumental in the transformation of America into the fascistic Homeland is
one
David Addington, Cheney's crackerjack legal mind and longtime hatchetman
who has along with others such as
John Yoo (a man who once said that the
president had the legal authority to
crush a child's testicles were it
deemed necessary) have toiled to change the law of the nation into something
dark and foreign.
In Addington's world there is legitimacy to engage in
illegal (at least until now) domestic spying, abduction and detention
without trial, torture both physical and mental (a horrifying example is
that of
Jose Padilla, an American citizen who would be the precedent for
future actions against other Americans) who was imprisoned and
psychologically destroyed through the application of mind control techniques
straight out of the infamous
CIA program MKULTRA to the point where his
mental capacities were that of "a piece of furniture".
Padilla was not only
a precedent setter but also a warning of what the government could do to a
person deemed to be a 'terrorist' or 'terrorist sympathizer', the
definitions of which are intentionally vague for a very terrifying reason.
David Addington, more than once referred to as
Cheney's Cheney was a key
player in the implementation of the shadow government infrastructure now
that it has come out from under the cover of darkness in the post-9/11 era.
Jane Meyer of the New Yorker speaks of their relationship in the following
interview from which I excerpt a piece from here:
How did David Addington get to know Vice-President Cheney, and how long have
they worked together?
They met on Capitol Hill in the mid-eighties, when Cheney was a Republican
congressman from Wyoming and Addington was a young staff lawyer working for
the House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees.
So they have worked
together for about two decades. Their partnership was cemented when they
worked together on the Minority Report on the Iran-Contra affair. Both Addington and Cheney took the idiosyncratic position that it was Congress,
not President Reagan, that was in the wrong.
This view reflected the
opinion, held by both men, that the executive branch should run foreign
policy, to a great extent unimpeded by Congress. It's a recurring
theme-pushing the limits of executive power and sidestepping Congress-in
their partnership. One example is their position that the President, as
Commander-in-Chief in times of war, had the inherent authority to ignore the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which Congress passed in an effort to
make sure that Presidents don't violate citizens' right to privacy by spying
on them without warrants.
After meeting and working together in Congress, Cheney and Addington
continued their partnership at the Pentagon, where, during the Presidency of
George H. W. Bush, Cheney was Secretary of Defense and Addington was his
special assistant and, later, general counsel. There, Addington was known as
a powerhouse, a stickler who controlled access to Cheney and marked up
others' memos in red felt-tipped pen, returning the memos for rewrites that
would make them sharper-and more protective of executive power.
At the Pentagon, the two exhibited a similar pessimism about world affairs,
in particular about the possibility that Mikhail Gorbachev represented true
change, and also an unusually deep interest in "continuity of government"
planning-how the government survives in the event of a doomsday attack.
Addington kept the constitutional provisions for Presidential succession in
his pocket at all times, a colleague told me.
Addington is still largely a mystery man but his connections to
Continuity
of Government during the Reagan era are documented as well as his ties to
Cheney. Another common denominator is the Iran-Contra affair, Addington was
a big player in it as well as most of the current crop of neocons who
returned to power under Bush II.
Addington also is connected to spook master
and former CIA head William 'Bill' Casey (a man whose history and past
associations is a veritable almanac of American fascism dating from WWII
through the Reagan years and who played a key role in the theft of the
PROMIS software) through The Lawless Group (named for CIA operative
Richard
Lawless, a close associate of Casey).
Sidney Blumenthal's article for Salon
entitled
The Sad decline of Michael Mukasey provides some additional
background on Mr. Addington:
Addington's dominion over the law - controlling the writing of the
president's executive orders and the memos from OLC, the office of the White
House counsel and the carefully placed network of general counsels
throughout the federal government's departments and agencies - is a
well-established and central aspect of Cheney's power.
Addington has been
indispensable to the vice president since he served as his counsel on the
joint congressional committee investigating the Iran-Contra scandal, when
Cheney was the ranking minority member. In that capacity, Addington wrote,
under Cheney's signature, the notorious minority report that was an early
clarion call for the imperial presidency.
Addington and Cheney's report decried Congress for its "hysteria" over the
Iran-Contra scandal, which involved the selling of missiles to Iran to
finance arms for the Nicaraguan Contras against explicit congressional
legislation. The Constitution, they argued,
"leaves little, if any doubt
that the president was expected to have the primary role of conducting the
foreign policy of the United States."
They added:
"Congressional actions to
limit the president in this area therefore should be reviewed with a
considerable degree of skepticism. If they interfere with the core
presidential foreign policy functions, they should be struck down."
The Cheney minority report was the doctrinal basis for the Bush presidency:
the unitary executive, the commander in chief ruling in wartime by fiat and,
ultimately, torture being defined as whatever the president, not the Geneva
Conventions, said it was. Addington's authorship of the Cheney Iran-Contra
report was largely overlooked until fairly recently, but his deeper
connection to that scandal and its resonance have received little attention.
In the 1980s, Addington, then in his 20s, served as deputy counsel to CIA
director William Casey, the moving force behind the Iran-Contra affair and
the most powerful figure in the Reagan administration after the president.
Along with other hotshots in the counsel's office, Addington was part of
what became known within the agency as the "Lawless Group," named after
Richard Lawless, a CIA operative who was a close assistant to Casey,
according to a former senior CIA official.
After Casey's death, Rep. Dick
Cheney co-opted the "Lawless Group," putting its members in key positions
when he was secretary of defense during the first Bush administration and
vice president in the second. (Lawless, for example, after working as Jeb
Bush's business partner, served as deputy undersecretary of defense,
retiring this past April.)
"A lot of the decisions on Iran-Contra were signed off by the counsel's
office," a longtime senior CIA official told me. "It was not a renegade
operation. It had lawyers, just like now. Everything they were doing was run
by the general counsel's office and Addington was deputy. You may draw your
own conclusions, as the Russians say."
In fact, the role of the counsel's
office surfaced in the trial of Alan Fiers, the CIA agent in charge of the
Central American Task Force, who pleaded guilty to misleading Congress.
But
that role was never investigated or ever really reported.
"These guys don't like the mainstream CIA. In fact, they hate it," the CIA
official explained.
"They don't like information unless it fits what they
want to hear. They hate the CIA because the CIA tells them what they don't
want to hear. They want assessments that prove ideological points. They are
looking for simplistic answers to complicated issues. They inhabit a
make-believe world of moving up into perceived areas of expertise. It's the
same guys; they all resurface when Republicans are back in power. It's the
same group. It's a system. The similarities are amazing in all these wars
we've been dragged into."
That 9/11 enabled Cheney, Addington and
the rest of the neocons to brutally
enforce their long planned agenda and has served as the basis for all that
has changed since that day there remains a truly legitimate question as to
what their role or knowledge of those attacks may have been.
It has been a
matter of intense debate in the alternative media as to what level of
involvement that this cabal may have had in ensuring that the attacks took
place (stay away from the Bush Did It canard which is only a straw man),
they did after all write in a document for the
Project For A New American
Century (PNAC) entitled
Rebuilding America's Defenses of the need for a "New
Pearl Harbor" in order for the public to accept their radical doctrine and
there never has been a legitimate investigation of 9/11 free of conflicts of
interest and with full subpoena power so as to ask the serious questions in
a public forum about the event that hit the reset button on over two and a
quarter centuries of American history and the subsequent implementation of a
fascist infrastructure.
In a fairly recent article that I wrote entitled
9/11: Cover for a Coup d'Etat?, I mused as to whether the 'terrorist' attacks merely provided cover
for an
Edward Luttwak style coup d'etat to be piggybacked on top of the
incidents using the Continuity of Government infrastructure.
The massive USA PATRIOT Act was already awaiting a rollout and there is the still
lingering question of who was really behind the Anthrax attacks that were
directed at those who were in positions to stop its implementation. 9/11
would be consistent with historical black operations and false flag attacks
and the festering disregard for American democracy by those who assumed
control in the aftermath is widely known but I am not going to revisit that
in this particular writing other than to ask the obvious question of Cui
Bono?
Whether 9/11 was indeed a coup by an alliance between the shadow
government along with rogue elements of foreign intelligence services is of
less importance than the consistent pattern of below the surface influence
and interactions of non-elected government officials and foreign and
domestic criminal elements.
Author and researcher Professor Peter Dale Scott
refers to a "Deep State" and I would refer readers of this article to one of
his entitled
9/11, Deep State Violence and the Hope of Internet Politics in
which Professor Scott provides an in depth look into not only the deep state
but asks serious questions about whether Continuity of Government was
implemented in the aftermath of 9/11.
I excerpt the following from this
piece:
In my book The Road to 9/11, I have argued that there has existed, at least
since World War Two if not earlier, an analogous American deep state, also
combining intelligence officials with elements from the drug-trafficking
underworld. I also pointed to recent decades of collaboration between the
U.S. deep state and al-Qaeda, a terrorist underworld whose drug-trafficking
activities have been played down in the 9/11 Commission Report and the
mainstream U.S. media.
The book referenced by Professor Scott is The Road to 9/11: Wealth, Empire
and the Future of America and it is an essential read for those seeking to
understand America as it exists today.
II:
Pictures of the Homeland
That the United States of America has nearly completed the tragic transition
to a fascist form of government becomes more apparent with each passing day
and each additional outrage and the cancer has so thoroughly metastasized
there is little hope that a new regime in Washington is going to be able to
bring it to a halt.
Whether it be the hijacking of the financial system by
the Wall Street banking cartel that is abetted by yet another capitulation
by a quisling Congress, more evidence of the desecration of privacy rights
by a surveillance industrial complex run amok, the alarming and ongoing
militarizing of the nation's police, the assignment of combat hardened
troops to domestic duty (with a mandate to quell civil unrest despite the
now for all intents and purposes
rendered irrelevant
the
Posse Comitatus Act) or
the constantly morphing and open ended definition of what exactly
constitutes being a 'terrorist' to name only a few of the more alarming
changes to the republic, those who are able to recognize such things as what
they truly are should be increasingly aware that the dreaded and ubiquitous
pejorative of conspiracy theorist is (as it always has been) one gigantic
sick joke.
The pushback against President Obama for announcing the planned
closure of the Gitmo torture gulag by the neocon embeds in the media has
been significant.
As the saying goes, if you put a frog into a pot of boiling water it will
react by jumping out immediately, but if you put that same frog into a pot
of lukewarm water and then very slowly increase the temperature of the
burner on the stove upon which it sits, that frog will stay in the pot until
it becomes soup. My fellow Americans, that frog is us and the parallel
reality that is so essential for the transformation of a state from one of
benevolent democracy to one of totalitarianism as set forth by Hannah
Arendt, is in the final stages of being swapped out.
The apple pie
authoritarianism becomes more entrenched, political discourse has been
reduced to nothing more than demagoguery, lies (either outright or more
commonly, through omission) clever and highly sophisticated propaganda,
race-baiting, fear-mongering and all delivered through a corrupted and
complicit corporate media machine and the celebrity shills that it employs
as barkers in the carnival of immorality and perversion that is the shell of
American now known as the Homeland.
In the run-up to the election, millions of little plastic pieces of vile
filth (that hew to the established storylines formerly established as an
example in one
Julius Streicher's publication Der Sturmer) in the form of a
DVD version of a deceitful and meticulously designed and professionally
produced (in order to evoke a proper emotional response from certain
credulous or otherwise mentally unstable fringe elements) propaganda film
Obsession
- Radical Islam's War Against the West and sponsored by a
well-funded, shadowy front group were mass distributed (28 million) in many
of the nation's newspapers and specifically in swing states in advance of
the coming election.
The obvious intent was to generate fear and hatred and
to manufacture consent as well as swing the election to McCain. It worked to
perfection as
Muslim children were gassed in the nursery of a Dayton, Ohio
mosque just after the Obsession DVD was distributed locally.
Of course in
the land of Orwellian newspeak it wasn't ruled an act of domestic terrorism.
For that matter, neither was Kristallnacht in a certain European closing
society that eerily parallels what has been going on in the post 9/11
'Homeland' although it is far more subtle for the original prototype was far
too ostentatious to endure for very long.
The Republican presidential campaign of John McCain (once again reverting to
true form in his opposition to the stimulus) and the shrill, strident kewpie
doll Sarah Palin used political rallies to whip up fear and loathing among
the worst fringe elements of society, inciting largely angry and easily
duped supporters into shouting "terrorist", "off with his head" and even
"kill him" in reference to Obama who has been the victim of a long-running,
highly coordinated, well financed campaign to paint him as a Manchurian
Candidate, a secret Muslim, a terrorist collaborator and a
wolf in sheep's
clothing.
This sort of sentiment continues to be encouraged by extremist
fifth columnists and will only fester more as the economy deteriorates and
scapegoats are manufactured. Multi-millionaire fascist demagogue Rush
Limbaugh (a modern day
Father Charles Coughlin) has become a
defacto
spokesman for the GOP and will continue to foment hatred amidst those most
susceptible.
The more paranoid elements are already being whipped into a
frenzy over Obama's second swearing in (the first was botched by Federalist
Society stooge Chief Justice John Roberts) in that he didn't place his hand
on a bible, and of course the dirty little rumors that Obama was not born in
the U.S. continue to be circulated.
Such vitriolic rallies became veritable lynch mobs and have merely gone
underground now that the people have spoken. In a time of an unprecedented
domestic economic crisis that already has Americans on the edge are
extremely dangerous and will inevitably lead to violence of course this
may be the intent as it is consistent with more traditional versions of
fascism.
In his study
The Authoritarians, Bob Altemeyer identified a certain
demographic segment of any society that are hard-wired for serving
authoritarians, susceptible to demagogy and subservient to perceived
authority figures.
This particular part of a population is essential to
supporting totalitarian figures who rise to power during troubled times and
offer simple answers to complex problems, they are essential components of
any fascist regime and their near psychotic fervor can be channeled to the
point where they are nothing more than automatons or tools to the dangerous
leaders of mass movements.
Such behavior was on full display at many Sarah Palin rallies and it wouldn't take much to turn such gatherings into staging
grounds for organized pogroms that could then be unleashed when the time is
right.
It certainly brings to mind George Orwell's
1984,
but then these are truly the times which Orwell so brilliantly prophesied,
Oceania has always been at war and always will be at war, for that is what
we are and all that we shall ever be in the land of the shadow government.
No fascist system can for long
exist without a certain die-hard percentage of the population who can be
mobilized as shock troops, don't ask questions and are full of resentment
and hatred, only seeking a strong leader on a white horse with simple
answers to complex problems and who will point them in the direction of
those who can be easily scapegoated.
History always repeats but it never
repeats exactly.
Yesteryear's Juden are today's liberals.
"The preparations for Hate Week were in full swing, and the staffs of all
the Ministries were working overtime. Processions, meetings, military
parades, lectures, waxworks, displays, film shows, tele-screen programs all
had to be organized; stands had to be erected, effigies built, slogans
coined, songs written, rumors circulated, photographs faked..".
-George Orwell
The ramming through of the Wall Street bailout (TARP), the financial
equivalent of the USA Patriot Act in that it placed unaccountable power in a
Treasury Department that has become an occupied colony of Goldman Sachs
despite a huge public outcry is another indication of just how much power
has been transferred into the executive branch.
The usual rubber-stamping by
a corrupt and (very likely threatened and blackmailed) Congress was a
foregone conclusion in the land of sham elections and an increasingly
tyrannical government (Martial
Law in USA? - The Death of Democracy).
The passage of this monstrosity was allegedly aided
by
a threat of martial law, this according to Representative
Brad Sherman of
California (below video).
Former President
George W. Bush took to the television airwaves
to once again sow fear over an economic Armageddon and also what could be
perceived as an implied threat of martial law in the language "America could
slip into a financial panic and a distressing scenario would unfold."
One
could speculate that the "distressing scenario" which Bush mentioned could
activate conditions as set forth in
NSPD-51
in order to deal with domestic
unrest due to bank holidays, food shortages and any sort of uprising as a
result of the financial collapse.
Main Core would be utilized to produce the
lists of those among the millions already deemed to be suspect and prone to
'subversive' behavior, the 3rd Infantry Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team
already in place stateside would be required to 'maintain the necessary
order' (augmented by
Blackwater and other private mercenaries of course) and
the roundups and internments would begin.
It was an eerie déjà vu moment in
which America was transported back to 2002 and 2003 with the apocalyptic
conjecture of smoking guns as mushroom clouds, phantom weapons of mass
destruction, sleeper cells, biological weapon spewing gliders that could
transverse the ocean and an evil dictator who was a "new Hitler".
III:
Some Historical Context
The United States has had a history of influential groups and individuals
that have a serious fascist bent.
Some of the most powerful bankers and
industrialists of the Great Depression era did plot a coup d'etat (The
Business Plot) in order to topple the hated Franklin D. Roosevelt, but were
thwarted when the man who they attempted to recruit to lead it, former
Marine Corps General Smedley D. Butler instead exposed them to Congress.
So
shocking was this that the media of that era closed ranks to protect the
traitors and erase the ugly blight from our sanitized version of history. It
was no secret that Italian dictator Benito Mussolini (once featured in a
fawning puff piece in Fortune Magazine) and even Nazi leader Adolf Hitler
had ardent American admirers and influential supporters who were enthralled
with their highly efficient, corporate friendly authoritarian states and
their ability to propagandize the masses and crush labor unions.
A trusted servant of robber barons and financial oligarchs named Prescott
Bush, a man whose lineage would include two future U.S. Presidents actually
engaged in doing business with the Nazis until the
Union Banking Corporation
was shut down by FDR under the Trading With the Enemy Act.
The OSS and later
the CIA actively recruited Nazis and assimilated Hitler's Eastern European
intelligence arm,
The Gehlen Organization ostensibly to fight communism.
Many top Nazi scientists and intelligence operatives including many who were
full blown war criminals were allowed entry into the U.S. under
Operation
Paperclip after the WW II had ended, they were then assimilated into what
would become the military industrial complex as rocket scientists,
psychiatrists and medical 'experts' (whose labs were the Nazi concentration
camps where gruesome medical experiments were performed on human prisoners,
I note that similar amnesty was given to Japanese war criminals who
participated in the infamous
Unit 731) whose wartime experience with mind
control and torture techniques would be of use to the CIA.
Some former Nazis
were allowed to migrate to Central and South America where they established
expatriate communities and joined forces with U.S. sponsored fascists to
crush leftist democratic movements in the most brutal of manner all under
the cover of defeating communism.
Former Nazis played key roles in the
carrying out of the wet work of the American empire in Latin America,
notably
Argentina and their influence would set the precedent for the
unimaginable cruelty and repression that would later be used in Nicaragua,
El Salvador and Pinochet's Chile as well as much later in Iraq.
Klaus Barbie aka the Butcher of Lyons was one of the more notable names and
is a perfect example of an asset being used to further American interests in
the southern cone, Barbie was a key part of the 'Cocaine Coup'.
The
corrupting influence that was asserted on intelligence, the military and
deep state movers and shakers by such a close affiliation with Nazi war
criminals and the inevitable damage done in terms of moral authority is as
difficult to fathom as it is extremely disturbing but that is a story for
another time.
So as not to overly dwell on the Nazi connection (the amount
of material on it is voluminous) I do want to comment that it shows the
depths to which the National Security State will go in order to ensure its
own perpetuation and ability to lay down with wolves so that the real power
structure in this country is allowed to function with ruthless,
Machiavellian precision in the darkness that exists just below the façade of
legitimate public and private institutions in the United States.
The Cold War gave the intelligence apparatus and the military industrial
complex the cover that was needed in order to build the infrastructure of an
extra-Constitutional government.
Almost from the very inception of the CIA
the United States became involved in the assassinations and overthrow of
legitimate democratically supported governments all undertaken for big
business and to crush resistance to western capitalism. The obvious Nazi
influence manifested itself in the extreme cruelty of the methods used to
expand the empire and death squads were sanctioned, torture was widespread
to the extent that it was even taught at the far-right
School of the
Americas and the agency participated in sadistic and immoral mind control
experimentation programs such as the notorious
MKULTRA.
It is of the utmost
importance to understand the root of evil that is the Central Intelligence
Agency that was put together by the American capitalist elite in the
aftermath of World War II to act as a Gestapo for Wall Street and business
interests not confined to the spheres of legality.
I would like to make
reference to a that summarizes this much better than I could ever hope to do
in a well documented story
How the CIA Created a Ruling, Corporate Overclass
in America that is a must read for everyone who really is serious about
going at the existing order.
The cover of darkness allows for the breeding of mutations and the CIA
itself eventually was able to reconfigure into compartmentalized factions,
some of the more militant joined forces with organized crime, extreme
right-wing groups, and elements of the military and foreign intelligence
services to carry out clandestine and black ops domestically.
The
assassination of President John F. Kennedy for all of the research,
investigations and time elapsed has never truly been solved and it is highly
likely that a
Secret Team (to use the term of L. Fletcher Prouty) may have
been involved in the assassination, a moment in our history after which
everything changed. Kennedy dared to challenge the power structure when he
spoke of:
"...a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert
means for expanding its sphere of influence - on infiltration instead of
invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of
free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.
It is a system
which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of
a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic,
intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations."
Many presume that this was directed at communism, the era was the height of
the Cold War but the speech was in the aftermath of the failed Bay of Pigs
invasion, a botched overthrow of Fidel Castro for which the more extreme
elements of the military, the fascist right, the CIA, organized crime and
big business interests that were thrown out of Cuba after the revolution
blamed Kennedy for undermining.
Kennedy had made very dangerous and mortal
enemies and further inflamed matters when he threatened to "splinter the CIA
in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds" and ousted director
Allen
Dulles, a man who was a major factor in the post WW II alliance with the
Nazis and Operation Paperclip as well as a member of Wall Street law firm
Sullivan and Cromwell, a representative of anti New Deal American fascists
as well as an alleged broker of business deals with the Nazi regime.
Ironically (or maybe not) Allen Dulles would later become a member of the
Warren Commission that gave legitimacy to the Lee Harvey Oswald as lone nut
conspiracy theory while ignoring the larger picture.
I reference the Kennedy
assassination not to go into it at any great length but that it, like the
later assassinations of Robert Kennedy and the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr were all coordinated actions of the shadow government
to remove opponents
of the rising American fascist state.
There have throughout the years been millions upon millions of pages written
by those who have investigated (and provided cover to the official
conspiracy story of) the Kennedy assassination and yet there is still no
real answer to what exactly happened but the reason why is the real key.
I
would like to note that some attention should be paid to the out of print
book by Carl Oglesby,
The Yankee and Cowboy War which looks into warring
factions and examines at length the JFK assassination, the implausibility of
Oswald and the story of Jack Ruby who never was able to tell his story
cryptically implored Chief Justice Warren that unless he was able to be
taken out of Dallas and to Washington to personally speak to President
Lyndon B. Johnson that:
"....Consequently, a whole new form of government is going to take over our
country, and I know I won't live to see you another time."
Peter Dale Scott who has himself done an immense amount of research on the JFK assassination puts it like this in his aforementioned essay
9/11, Deep
State Violence and the Hope of Internet Politics has this to say about
America and the failure to come to terms with the murder of John F. Kennedy:
Recent history has seen a number of such events, such as the assassination
of John F. Kennedy, that are so inexplicable by the public notions of
American politics that most Americans tend not even to think of them.
Instead most accept the official surface explanations for them, even if they
suspect these are not true.
Or if others say they believe that "Oswald acted
alone," they may do so in the same comforting but irrational state of mind
that believes God will reward the righteous and punish the wicked.
Kennedy's death paved the way for the military industrial complex (that
President Eisenhower ominously warned of in his farewell speech) to escalate
the Vietnam War and declare war on the American public who dissented with
the immorality of that damned war and took to the streets in protest.
Their
efforts would shake the very foundations of this nation's corrupted
institutions, terrify the ruling elite classes and create a climate where
any means necessary to control domestic unrest would be utilized lest the
existing order be toppled.
IV:
The Reagan Years
As I wrote in part one of this ongoing series, the recent articles
Christopher Ketcham entitled The Last Roundup and Tim Shorrock's
Exposing
Bush's Historic Abuse of Power are both about the massive database Main Core
and how it relates to Continuity of Government programs. It is encouraging
to see that there is now more being written about this subject by more well
known and influential figures than this humble blogger.
Author James Bamford's new book on the NSA entitled
The Shadow Factory is drawing a good
deal of attention already on just how much that Americans have been spied on
by our own government, the rogue neocon occupying faction as well as
Israeli
elements working alone and in conjunction with domestic interests (but much
more on that in part four of this series).
Arch-conservative John Whitehead
of the
Rutherford Institute (instrumental in funding Paula Jones' lawsuit
against President Clinton) wrote two articles on the shadow government which
shows that the immense danger of this transcends the trivialities of
partisan politics.
I excerpt a small piece from Mr. Whitehead below:
What is the bottom line here? We are, for all intents and purposes, one
terrorist attack away from having a full-fledged authoritarian state emerge
from the shadows, at which time democratic government will be dissolved and
the country will be ruled by an unelected bureaucracy. And because so much
of this shadow government remains under wraps, there is much we don't know
about it. Yet that does not diminish the threat it poses to democratic
government.
In his 1961 Farewell Address to the Nation, Dwight D. Eisenhower tried to
warn us that a nefarious military-industrial complex had emerged in America.
"The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will
persist," he said. Eisenhower realized that after World War II, America had
become a national security state that operated largely in secret and
answered to practically no one.
It is heartening to see this most critical of subjects being examined at
last for if the relentless drive towards an American fascist government is
not at the very minimum slowed, then nothing else is really going to matter
is it?
But I digress....
As I previously stated, this particular administration of an ubiquitous,
personable, uninquisitive, (and eventually doddering) longtime pitchman for
the American brand of hard right fascism was a veritable devil's playground
for those who more than dabbled in concocting dangerous plans in the
darkness that could be put into use against all perceived enemies of
America, both foreign and domestic, and during which a lot of cash could be
made on the side.
Reagan was backed by longtime spook, fixer and former CIA
chief George Herbert Walker Bush who used the office of the Vice President
as a fertile launching ground to lay the groundwork for what his son would
so effectively preside over as the "unitary executive" with the necessary
muscle provided by Dick Cheney and the neocons who found a friendly
incubator for their decidedly radical anti-American ideas during the Reagan
administration.
Reagan's White House was a front for:
Most of the veteran shadow government operators went
on to become influential players in the Bush-Cheney administration where
they have worked to ensure that their plans would reach fruition.
It was during the Reagan administration that Earl Brian, a crony of Ed Meese
assisted in the theft and distribution of the enhanced version of INSLAW's
PROMIS software and it was put to good use by among others Colonel Oliver
North who used it in conjunction with his REX 84 program to track and
monitor potential dissidents or opponents who could be rounded up when and
if the time was deemed necessary.
Similarly such operations were already on
the books in
Operation Cable Splicer and
Operation Garden Plot.
PROMIS was
also distributed and used by foreign intelligence services
such as the Mossad according to the Gordon Thomas book
Gideon's Spies. Israel has always
proved a useful cutout for shadow government black ops such as Iran Contra
and the Bamford book looks at the role of Israel in the ongoing illegal
spying of the Bush regime.
Both Shorrock's and Ketcham's pieces link Main
Core to PROMIS which provides the link through C.O.G. to the shadow
government itself which was at it's most visible during the Reagan years.
North ran the
REX 84 program out of FEMA to plan for the mass roundup and
detention of American citizens, allegedly targeting about 400,000 'illegal
aliens' (brown skinned people always seem to make for good scapegoats and
cover for secretive government operations), with Cable Splicer and Garden
Plot as prototypes the current administration has launched a similar program
called
Operation Falcon, a potential test run to fill up those detention
facilities that Haliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root were awarded
a
$385 million contract for?
If so you can rest assured that Main Core will be
able to generate the pickup lists for such an operation. The camps were
justified in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina as being necessary for
illegal immigrant roundups, temporary housing facilities for displaced
victims of natural disasters and for other unspecified "new programs".
Maureen Farrell wrote the definitive piece on this for Buzzflash in 2006
entitled Detention Camp Jitters.
I only wish that I was making this stuff up
but it is far more advanced than we know.
I reference breaking news by Ellen Brown on the mysterious
Wackenhut prison
buses that were sighted in the Arizona desert; I will address this in more
detail in the next installment.
V:
Conclusion
Our cities have turned into jungles
And corruption is stranglin' the land
The police force is watching the people
And the people just can't understand
We don't know how to mind our own business
'Cause the whole worlds got to be just like us
Now we are fighting a war over there
No matter who's the winner
We can't pay the cost
'Cause there's a monster on the loose
It's got our heads into a noose
And it just sits there watching
-Monster (Steppenwolf)
America post-9/11 has been a period of triumph for the shadow government.
The ascendance has now been nearly completed; the transformation for all
intents and purposes is likely now irreversible.
The surveillance grids have
been locked into place, the Constitution altered forever, the opposition
cowed and nullified, the media matrix impenetrable, the Congress rendered
irrelevant, the public brainwashed and the military on alert to move against
the citizenry domestically (when the order is given. As they say in the
financial world, the gains have been locked in.
Despite the banishment of Bush-Cheney there will likely be no real
restoration of what has been lost nor will there be any serious type of
accountability, fascism and militarism are now as American as apple pie.
Certainly there will be cosmetic changes, President
Obama has already
announced Guantanamo Bay will be closed, it's just become too much of a
symbol of all that has gone wrong.
Torture has also been denounced by Obama
and the CIA black prisons have been ordered to be shut down but with a
deeply entrenched renegade shadow government it is likely that the ghost
planes will continue their rendition routes to black sites abroad (albeit
covertly) and that private surveillance and intelligence outfits will
continue to receive government funding and mercenary armies like those of
the infamous
Blackwater will continue to grow stronger.
While Tim Shorrock in his Salon piece "Exposing Bush's Historic Abuse of
Power" writes of rumors of a potential series of Congressional
investigations:
The proposal for a Church Committee-style investigation emerged from talks
between civil liberties advocates and aides to Democratic leaders in
Congress, according to sources involved. (Pelosi's and Conyers' offices both
declined to comment.)
Looking forward to 2009, when both Congress and the
White House may well be controlled by Democrats, the idea is to have
Congress appoint
an investigative body to discover the full extent of what
the Bush White House did in the war on terror to undermine the Constitution
and U.S. and international laws.
The goal would be to implement government
reforms aimed at preventing future abuses - and perhaps to bring
accountability for wrongdoing by Bush officials.
"If we know this much about torture, rendition, secret prisons and
warrantless wiretapping despite the administration's attempts to stonewall,
then imagine what we don't know," says a senior Democratic congressional
aide who is familiar with the proposal and has been involved in several
high-profile congressional investigations.
"You have to go back to the McCarthy era to find this level of abuse," says
Barry Steinhardt, the director of the Program on Technology and Liberty for
the American Civil Liberties Union. "Because the Bush administration has
been so opaque, we don't know [the extent of] what laws have been violated."
The parameters for an investigation were outlined in a seven-page memo,
written after the former member of the Church Committee met for discussions
with the ACLU, the Center for Democracy and Technology, Common Cause and
other watchdog groups.
Key issues to investigate, those involved say, would
include the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance activities; the
Central Intelligence Agency's use of extraordinary rendition and torture
against terrorist suspects; and the U.S. government's extensive use of
military assets - including satellites, Pentagon intelligence agencies and
U2 surveillance planes - for a vast spying apparatus that could be used
against the American people.
Specifically, the ACLU and other groups want to know how the NSA's use of
databases and data mining may have meshed with other domestic intelligence
activities, such as the U.S. government's extensive use of no-fly lists and
the Treasury Department's list of "specially designated global terrorists"
to identify potential suspects.
As of mid-July, says Steinhardt, the no-fly
list includes more than 1 million records corresponding to more than 400,000
names. If those people really represent terrorist threats, he says,
"our
cities would be ablaze."
A deeper investigation into intelligence abuses
should focus on how these lists feed on each other, Steinhardt says, as well
as the government's "inexorable trend towards treating everyone as a
suspect."
"It's not just the 'Terrorist Surveillance Program,'" agrees Gregory T.
Nojeim from the Center for Democracy and Technology, referring to the Bush
administration's misleading name for the NSA's warrantless wiretapping
program.
"We need a broad investigation on the way all the moving parts fit
together. It seems like we're always looking at little chunks and missing
the big picture."
A prime area of inquiry for a sweeping new investigation would be the Bush
administration's alleged use of a top-secret database to guide its domestic
surveillance. Dating back to the 1980s and known to government insiders as
"Main Core," the database reportedly collects and stores - without warrants
or court orders - the names and detailed data of Americans considered being
threats to national security.
And -
Getting a full picture on Bush's intelligence programs, however, will almost
certainly require any sweeping new investigation to have a scope that would
inoculate it against charges of partisanship.
During one recent discussion
on Capitol Hill, according to a participant, a senior aide to Speaker Pelosi
was asked for Pelosi's views on a proposal to expand the investigation to
past administrations, including those of Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush.
"The question was, how far back in time would we have to go to make this
credible?" the participant in the meeting recalled.
However given the inability of the Congress to do anything to provide a
check on the monstrous abuses of the Bush-Cheney regime (and those shadow
government activities that preceded it) it is highly unlikely that any
legitimate, official review along the lines of the Church Committee will
ever occur.
If there is any sort of an investigation I would think that it
would be a dog and pony show whitewash along the lines of the Warren
Commission or the Kean-Hamilton 9/11 Commission, both of which served to do
nothing other than provide the façade of an investigation while protecting
those implicated from having their criminality exposed in the interests of
national security and to continue to provide cover for the existing
established order.
In their true feckless manner the Democrats are already
deferring to their more openly fascist cohorts in the first days of the new
administration which does not bode well for the future.
Too much damage has already been done and too many stand to face not only
criminal charges but also charges of outright treason if the sort of
sweeping investigation that is required to get into the real systemic rot is
undertaken.

I: WATCH LISTS, BLACK LISTS, ENEMIES LISTS... HIT LISTS?
With the long overdue departure of the Bush administration from the White
House it is the hope many that the myriad of transgressions against the
Constitution and the people of America will begin to seep out into the
public domain. It took a remarkably short time.
The day after the helicopter
hauled ole George away like so much rubbish a major story broke. In an
astonishing shot across the bow directed at the shadow government the first
significant whistleblower has already come out with a story (once again
ignored by the corporate media) and delivered a devastating blow to the
premise that the massive illegal domestic spying programs of the Bush
administration were undertaken in order to protect America from terrorism in
the aftermath of September 11th, 2001.
Former NSA analyst Russell Tice during two recent interviews on MSNBCs
Countdown with Keith Olbermann (pt 1, pt 2 far above) confirmed that the
Bush-Cheney-Rove phony war on terror was as people like myself have always
strongly suspected in actuality a war on America itself.
According to the
patriotic Mr. Tice the targets of the domestic spying included news
organizations and journalists and that the surveillance for specific targets
was not limited to professional matters alone, they were spied on 24/7.
"The National Security Agency had access to all Americans' communications,"
he said. "Faxes, phone calls and their computer communications. ... They
monitored all communications."
Tice said the NSA analyzed metadata to determine which communication would
be collected. Offering a hypothetical example, he said if the agency
determined that terrorists communicate in brief, two-minute phone calls, the
NSA might program its systems to record all such calls, invading the privacy
of anyone prone to telephonic succinctness.
Tice was involved in only a small part of the project, that involved trying
to "harpoon fish from an airplane."
He said he was told to monitor certain groups in order to eliminate them as
suspects for more intense targeting. Those groups, he said, were U.S.
journalists and news agencies.
But rather than excluding the news
organizations from monitoring, he discovered that the NSA was collecting the
organizations' communications 24 hours a day year round.
"It made no sense," he said.
Tice did not identify the reporters or organizations allegedly targeted.
Olbermann asked if this means there's a file somewhere containing every
e-mail and phone conversation these reporters ever had with sources, editors
and family members.
"If it was involved in this specific avenue of collection, it would be
everything, yes." Tice answered.
(Excerpted from
Wired's Kim Zetter's blog)
The Tice interviews followed another former insider speaking out on the
gross illegality of the Bush administration programs, a former DOJ employee
named Thomas Tamm was featured in a Newsweek magazine cover story by
Michael Isikoff entitled
The Fed Who Blew the Whistle from which I excerpt the
following:
In the spring of 2004, Tamm had just finished a yearlong stint at a Justice
Department unit handling wiretaps of suspected terrorists and spiesa unit
so sensitive that employees are required to put their hands through a
biometric scanner to check their fingerprints upon entering.
While there,
Tamm stumbled upon the existence of a highly classified National Security
Agency program that seemed to be eavesdropping on U.S. citizens. The unit
had special rules that appeared to be hiding the NSA activities from a panel
of federal judges who are required to approve such surveillance. When Tamm
started asking questions, his supervisors told him to drop the subject.
He
says one volunteered that "the program" (as it was commonly called within
the office) was "probably illegal."
The name of the program was Stellar Wind and please pay particular attention
to this next excerpted piece from Isikoff's story:
The NSA, with the secret cooperation of U.S. telecommunications companies,
had begun collecting vast amounts of information about the phone and e-mail
records of American citizens. Separately, the NSA was also able to access,
for the first time, massive volumes of personal financial recordssuch as
credit-card transactions, wire transfers and bank withdrawalsthat were
being reported to the Treasury Department by financial institutions.
These
included millions of "suspicious-activity reports," or SARS, according to
two former Treasury officials who declined to be identified talking about
sensitive programs. (It was one such report that tipped FBI agents to former
New York governor Eliot Spitzer's use of prostitutes.)
These records were
fed into NSA supercomputers for the purpose of "data mining"looking for
links or patterns that might (or might not) suggest terrorist activity.
This latest glimpse beneath the facade at the massive, secretive and highly
illegal surveillance campaign against the American people is an outrage.
Given the proclivity of those who run the system in this country to exert
raw power to advance their own agendas it is no leap in logic that
journalists alone were the only group targeted.
There remains the question
of whether blackmail, especially sexual blackmail is routinely used as a
tool to keep government and media officials from not straying too far from
the dirty business of imperialism and financial chicanery of the sort that
has brought the economy to its knees.
I personally found the media spectacle
of the fortuitously timed prostitution bust of former New York Governor
Elliot Spitzer who incidentally had just announced his intention to declare
war on the banksters and their accomplices in the Bush White House in a
February 14, 2008 Washington Post piece entitled
Predatory Lenders Partner
in Crime to be extremely suspicious.
The rogue Bush regime and the NSA have
been using their big lie of the war on terror as an excuse to scrutinize
credit card use and Spitzer would have been an obvious target as is
indicated by the above excerpt from the Newsweek story.
It also makes
skeptics such as myself wonder whether the witch hunt to impeach former
Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich may at least in part be attributed to his
threat to suspend state business with Bank of America, 'Blago' was arrested
the day afterwards.
In light of the Tice revelations as well as an already long and extremely
sordid history of U.S. government surveillance into the activities of
dissidents and reporters that predated the Bush regime, we also need to ask
some very serious questions of a much more troubling and nefarious nature.
For example, how does such spying tie into not only the manipulation of the
news but the now standard lack of spine from the Democratic congress when it
comes to prosecuting the Bush administration criminals?
Notorious fixer Karl
Rove has already announced his intent to defy yet another subpoena for his
testimony that was to have been delivered on Monday in front of the House
Judiciary Committee. As of this writing,
John Conyers has once again caved
and the date has now been pushed into February and likely will soon
disappear down the same memory hole where similar attempts to enforce the
law have been flushed.
Intense political pressure, threats of unemployment in a time of economic
crisis and potentially embarrassing sexual acts subject to blackmail are all
entirely made possible by the rampant unaccountability of the domestic
spying programs, but are there measures that go far beyond just the spiking
of stories, the discrediting or the ruining of careers alone?
Think back to
the
vicious institutionalized slander directed former San Jose Mercury News
reporter Gary Webb for example for his
Dark Alliance series. The savagery
with which Webb was taken down by the establishment was stunning and it
ultimately resulted in his suicide, a broken and haunted man who only dared
to try to tell the truth.
There is a long trail of untimely demises of investigative journalists and
other insiders whose knowledge represents a threat to very existence of the
shadow government and those who it as a matter of routine does business with
in order to avoid legitimate channels.
Perhaps the most terrifying of all
question is exactly what actions do end up being taken in order to prevent
the,
-
exposure of widespread criminal activity
-
systemic grand scale fraud
-
extra-constitutional black operations
that have been conducted for decades
Investigative journalist Wayne Madsen wrote of an NSA database that was at
one time named
FIRSTFRUITS that was maintained to engage in surveillance
against journalists and that was renamed after its discovery.
Some of the
names in this database allegedly included:
-
Christiane Amanpour
-
Seymour Hersh
-
James Bamford
-
James Risen
-
Madsen himself
According to chatter in the blogosphere that were it not consistent with the historical trail of dead
bodies could easily be dismissed as paranoia and disinformation.
One story
floating around the internet mentioned an unnamed NSA security officer
allegedly mused about just killing troublesome bloggers.
This may be a
product of paranoia (one would think paranoia would be a natural state in a
land of fear and loathing such as that which the United States has become
post 9/11) but there is great progress currently being made by internet
researchers and such reputed threats should not simply be waved off as the rantings of tin foil hatters or the favorite of all pejoratives directed at
those who dare to ask inconvenient questions, conspiracy theorists.
The fact
that the alternative media and many bloggers are slowly starting to put the
pieces together one can only reasonably suspect that such behavior scares
the living hell out of the establishment, and after all, there is a history
of that sort of thing. While this is not a comprehensive list the Committee
to Protect Journalists
keeps a database to track the prematurely deceased in
a most dangerous profession.
The bizarre absence of any reporting of this very serious violation of civil
liberties has received absolutely no coverage in the corporatized,
mainstream pocket media.
This is unconscionable that there is apparently no
interest in exposing these crimes, especially considering that those
targeted could actually save their own hides (and perhaps instill some
dignity) by outing this program. It's a sad testament to the state of
today's 'journalism' that is shameful by comparison to that of days of yore
when reporters were intrepid souls determined to speak the truth to power.
Writer Eric Alterman puts it spot on in his recent Center for American
Progress piece entitled
Think Again - Spying on Journalists? Why the Silence?
when he notes the lack of intestinal fortitude in the mainstream media:
Clearly something deeply disturbing lurks beneath these revelations, and
with Bush gone from office, its hard to understand just what is preventing
journalists from seeking the truth about this program more energetically.
The only thing they have to fear is fear itself.
This sad state of affairs brings to mind the following:
When the Nazis came for the communists,
I remained silent;
I was not a communist.
When they locked up the social democrats,
I remained silent;
I was not a social democrat.
When they came for the trade unionists,
I did not speak out;
I was not a trade unionist.
When they came for the Jews,
I remained silent;
I was not a Jew.
When they came for me,
there was no one left to speak out.
- Pastor Martin Niemöller
And the silence by those tasked by the First Amendments now quaint and
antiquated imbuing upon them a responsibility for a free press as an
essential check on authoritarianism is deafening in its absence.
Quislings,
cowards and public relations flacks seem to be the one thing that our
journalism schools never failed to produce over the past several decades,
feckless and spineless careerists with neither a sense of honor nor of their
place as defenders of precious liberty.
There shall be no refuge for the
weasels nor the rats in the end therefore their mass abrogation of their
chosen profession along with their acute absence of courage is even more
damnable for when the time comes they will perhaps live to lament that they
did not speak out when they had the chance.
II: NIGHT AND FOG
Death Solves All Problems, No Man, No Problem
- Joseph Stalin
The National Security State has a history of silencing those who would speak
out and especially reporters deemed to have become a nuisance. This is done
either through intense pressure brought down on media corporations through
organized harassment of sponsors, brutal coordinated smear campaigns much
like the one that took down the aforementioned Gary Webb or when all else
fails, the reporters often just happen to turn up mysteriously dead.
The
list of suicides and accidents is a long one and in the view of the
ruthless psychopaths who both run and profit from a high-tech snooping
network seems to be that any means are to be undertaken to keep their games
going even if it ultimately results in termination with extreme prejudice.
I
believe that I will have to put together a list myself but when I just
started writing down names off the top of my head of strange deaths I came
up with over thirty right off the bat.
The ugly truth is that none of these police state powers are being used to
protect the United States from foreign enemies, terrorism or any other
excuse that is being made in order to get Americans to submit their rights.
It is all in the name of power, money and to protect the interests of the
oligarchy and the power elite who run the establishment and it needs to be
stopped because it is out of control.
Take the strange case of
Danny Casolaro for example...
Perhaps the closest to get at the truth about PROMIS and how it was an
integral piece of the shadow government was investigative journalist Danny
Casolaro. Casolaro had been working on research for a book on a shadowy
transnational power group that seemed to run through the postwar era and had
connections to many of the major scandals including Iran-Contra, BCCI, the Nugan Hand Bank, international drug cartels, weapons dealers and
intelligence operatives in not only the U.S. government but internationally
as well.
Casolaro dubbed this group, one that largely rose out of a dirty
old boy network of the OSS/CIA out of the ashes of World War II as
The
Octopus.
Casolaro began to become aware of the more sinister aspects of what
Professor Peter Dale Scott refers to as the deep state but is more commonly
known as either the shadow government, the parallel government and even
arguably the permanent government while investigating the theft of the PROMIS software from the Inslaw corporation.
On Saturday, August 10, 1991 a maid at a Martinsburg, West Virginia Sheraton
Inn was horrified to find the nude body of Joseph Daniel Casolaro in the
bathtub, the victim of an apparent suicide. It was by accounts a
particularly grisly scene and a strangely violent suicide with both of his
wrists slashed deeply multiple times with a razor blade.
There was a very
short and impersonal note, blood splattered on the tile walls and a pair of
bloody towels that were shoved under the sink away from the bathtub.
Strange circumstances followed in the aftermath of the discovery of Danny
Casolaros corpse in a blood filled bathtub. His body was hastily taken away
and embalmed (making any subsequent autopsy much more difficult) before
family members were officially notified (a violation of state law by
accounts) and room 517 had been professionally cleaned thereby removing
critical evidence prior to any sort of thorough forensic investigation could
be performed.
Compounding doubts about the official suicide story are
contradictory statements made by friends and family that Casolaro was NOT
suicidal at all but was actually quite exited over the prospect of
publishing his book on the findings of his investigative work, even to the
extent that he had scheduled a party to celebrate. He was in the final
stages of nailing down the story of the century and had gone to West
Virginia in search of the evidence that would prove his theory, make the
connection to PROMIS and bring back the head of the octopus.
The sudden
ending (yet another hotel room 'suicide') was especially suspicious because
when the body was discovered, his files were missing.
In addition to the shadowy players in the global arms and narcotics trades
the Octopus also appeared to have had as tentacles rogue elements of U.S.
intelligence Casolaro found connections to not only Iran-Contra but also
BCCI, the Nugan Hand bank, the October Surprise, money launderers and
organized crime as well as a continuous thread of involvement in dirty
dealings both domestically and abroad.
The roots of this milieu of
malevolence stretched back to the post World War II era when a collection of
spooks, corrupt bureaucrats and extremist right wing ideologues began to
operate as a faction within the intelligence apparatus, a state upon
themselves to profit financially while engaging in the darks forms of
clandestine activities and black operations.
Author Joel Bainerman in his 1992 book entitled
The Crimes of a President
wrote the following (some of this ostensibly quoting William Hamilton of Inslaw as well as a 1991 story from the St. Louis Dispatch) that has a very
good description on Casolaro's theory:
Casolaro had discovered a common denominator to the theft of Inslaws
software and other recent scandals says Hamilton who worked very closely
with Casolaro right up to his death in helping him to uncover the dirty
dealing behind the theft of Inslaws software.
A group of individuals
trained in covert intelligence operations and aligned with the U.S.
political leadership who were allegedly profiting from each of these
scandals.
These veterans of U.S. covert intelligence operations had also allegedly
been selling pirated copies of Inslaws software to foreign intelligence and
law enforcement agencies and funneling the funds through BCCI. Casolaro
believed that some of the profits from these illegal sales made their way
into a slush fund used for political payoffs and covert intelligence
operations not authorized by congress.
Danny Casolaro is far from the only one to whom mysterious death had
befallen after their investigative work got them too close to the real power
structure or presented an obstacle to its need for the cloak of secrecy.
Too
many rising politicians, uncooperative politicians and judges, hostile
witnesses, whistle blowers and reporters have met with no small number of
strange and untimely deaths often attributed to accidents (small plane
crashes in particular), suicides( a good deal of them in hotel rooms),
sudden heart attacks or seizures (many in people with no history of such
problems) and random acts of extreme violence that go unsolved by
authorities.
In addition to Casolaro, other suspicious deaths of investigators of this
particular nexus of evil include Financial Times reporter
Anson Ng,
reportedly a friend of Casolaro who was found dead from a gunshot wound in
his Guatemala City apartment where he was reportedly working on a story
related to BCCI and to
try to interview a guy named Jimmy Hughes who
according to the writer Rodney Stitch had information regarding shady
dealings at the Cabazon Indian Reservation near Palm Springs, CA as well as
Jonathan Moyle whose body was found hanging in a closet in a Santiago hotel
room where he had been investigating the CIA and the arms trade.
Joel Bainerman also noted in his book that the Cabazon Indian Reservation
where the PROMIS software was allegedly modified for espionage purposes by a
very interesting character, a technical genius named
Michael Riconosciuto to
include the back door feature (to allow for secret access) was in fact a
CIA cutout.
The government contracting firm Wackenhut, a Florida based
corporation alleged to have been involved in sensitive 'private security'
matters (Blackwater before Blackwater) was involved at the time
in a
joint-venture with the Cabazon tribe to use the sovereign land
status of the reservation to work on a variety of endeavors including the
development and testing of arms including a fuel air explosive, biochemical
warfare agents and other armaments that could be provided to third world
regimes, primarily to right wing governments in Latin America.
The Cabazon Indian Reservation
was allegedly transformed into veritable spook nest as well as a staging
ground for covert military industrial complex purposes. Wackenhut
incidentally is back in the news (or at least the alternative media) with
Ellen Brown's recent story about the mysterious prison buses spotted in
Arizona so they are still a player and a big one at that.
I would venture to
speculate that the truth about Wackenhut Corporation and its longtime
involvement in the prison industrial complex that has become so very, very
lucrative to this fascist society is something that deserves one hell of a
good deal of scrutiny.
III: INDIO 2008
Interestingly enough there was a local news investigation in the Palm
Springs area in 2008 that had focused on the 2005 multiple murder-suicide of
Riverside County District Attorney Investigator David McGowan and five
members of his family.
As the series continued questions began to arise on
whether McGowan had been digging a bit too deeply into a cold case file
regarding a
1981 triple murder on the Cabazon Reservation that had ties to
the covert activities that Danny Casolaro was investigating.
Subsequent
installments in the KESQ series by news reporter Nathan Baca began to
ask
questions about PROMIS as well as the other mysterious activities at the
reservation and began to delve into the 1981 murders of tribal leader Fred
Alvarez who resisted those behind the Cabazon-Wackenhut joint venture as
well as two friends.
An interview was conducted with the daughter of one of
the victims who is to this day seeking justice for the murder of her father
Ralph Boger.
Rachel Begley (her website is called
desertfae) very accurately
described what has been going on at Cabazon as follows:
"I'm more shocked than anything. I had no idea these things were going on.
Most of America doesn't know these things are going on," said Begley. "It's
still going on to this day. It's a big web of corruption."
The series ended abruptly in October
after an installment that began to
delve into whether other local Indian tribes may have been involved in
dealings with
Wackenhut and mentioned an experimental electromagnetic
weapon called a "railgun" as being one of the projects. That the KESQ story
has not continued is disappointing but certainly not surprising given the
history of what has happened to those digging too deeply into affairs
involving the PROMIS software - I would hope that it will eventually be
resumed.
In my own opinion, I would suspect that fear may a motivating
factor in the suspension of this series, especially after the detective who
had been investigating the case stated that he:
"doesn't want to continue on
the case based on the number of people who have met an untimely demise while
doing so".
Who knows, I hope that that isn't the case and that a new
installment will be forthcoming in the near future, as a concerned American
it is extremely important that it at some point continue because Mr. Baca is
onto something BIG.
Now, since I feel that it is particularly relevant I am posting an email
from said detective to an unnamed third party who he was seeking advice from
and specifically for the comments of said detective that I have highlighted
that should send a chill up the spine of all who read this:

Subject: Alvarez Triple Homicide
Hello X
My name is X and I'm with the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. I'm a
homicide detective assigned to the cold case division. The Alvarez triple
homicide was assigned to me a couple of months ago.
For the past two months I have reviewed nearly a thousand documents of
police reports, and spent many hours browsing the Internet for additional
sources of information. As I am sure you can imagine, I feel a bit like
Alice in Wonderland after falling down the rabbit hole. I no longer have a
complete grasp on the real world.
You should know first off, that I am an experienced investigator with 18
years on the Sheriff's Dept. and I consider myself pretty intuitive when it
comes to filtering out the BS. After my first review of the police reports
in this case, I wasn't sure why it remained unsolved for over 26 years. All
of the players were identified and the Modus Operandi seemed to be well
established. I couldn't understand why every few years the case was suddenly
dropped and put back on the shelf.
That's when Rachel Begley introduced me to the rabbit hole. After the
countless hours I have now spent on her website and the numerous other
conspiracy theorists websites, I'm having a very difficult time sifting
through the BS.
I have also spent much time on your website and I have found your
investigations impressive and your opinions refreshing. That is why I am
writing to you now. I do not make it a habit of talking to journalists about
open homicide investigations, however, it appears you are much more educated
about this particular case than I am.
I know you are very busy and I understand the Alvarez triple homicide is a
very small part of the Octopus, but I would be very interested in spending
any time with you that you have available, in order to get some perspective
on what I've read.
Just so you understand where I am in this case. I am currently preparing a
review and summary for my Sergeant. My conclusion will be that I do not wish
to continue investigating this case, based on the number of people who have
met an untimely demise while doing so.
My actions in this matter go against everything I believe in, and this case
is very difficult for me to walk away from, especially with the allegations
that involve the deaths of Investigator Dave McGowan and his family. But I
am conceding to a higher power (my wife) and trying to give her some peace
of mind. I cannot look her in the eyes and tell her that I am willing to
risk the life of my family by pursuing this.
I am interested in your opinion. Am I just another lamb to the slaughter? Is
the Puppet Master pulling my strings via Rachel Begley? Is this just a
simple case of murder by Jimmy Hughes at the direction of John P. Nichols,
or is it really much more than that?
Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you,

IV: Conclusion
It is with the hope of this humble blogger that this series as well as other
damning information such as that put forth by Mr. Tice, Mr. Tamm and other
patriotic Americans who have risked all (and at times paid with their
careers and lives) all in order to get the truth out will encourage others
to do the same.
It is long past time to bring attention to the history of
grossly immoral and criminal acts that have been perpetrated against the
people of the United States by the very institutions that are supposed to be
protecting us. It is imperative that others begin to work independently (and
together whenever possible) to mount their own investigations into how the
government has been weaponized by a pack of fascist thugs so that they may
reap the benefits at the expense of those who are not connected to an
elitist ruling class that is hell bent on maintaining the status quo.
Danny Casolaro did not have the most powerful tool against injustice and
corruption available while he was alive, the internet was only in its
nascent stages and had he the ability that we enjoy due to advances in
technology he may very well still be alive and the criminal usurpers of our
democracy and violators of our constitution could be where they belong in
prison.
It is my hope that one with more influence, internal knowledge and
resources than I have at my disposal begin to not only do very serious
investigative work but to also petition the new administration of President
Barack Obama for the following:
-
An immediate cessation of all illegal, unconstitutional surveillance and
data-mining that has been ongoing against law abiding American citizens.
-
The creation of an independent investigative body along the lines of the
Church Committee imbued with sweeping powers to investigate abuses of
intelligence both within the government as well as with private contractors
who have collaborated in crimes against the republic and its citizens.
-
A case by case federal investigation into ALL suspicious deaths of
reporters and other individuals either directly or indirectly involved in
the investigation of what has been done with the PROMIS software, NSA spying
and Continuity of Government programs. Especially now that it has been
revealed that the NSA has been actively spying on journalists and news
organizations.
-
A restoration of the rule of law as a bulwark against tyranny as was
intended by our founding fathers who having full knowledge of how
unaccountable despots behave risked all to lay the foundation of a free
society where the highest ideals of liberty can be enjoyed by all.
-
In iron tight regulatory system to ensure that such flagrant abuses of
power never be allowed to occur again in the future. The cloak of secrecy
needs to be removed and all government must be open to the scrutiny of those
who it is supposed to serve.
-
The prosecution to the full extent of the law of those who are currently
or who have in the past been involved in any criminal activity in relation
to the aforementioned.
Truly, nothing else will suffice if we are to have any credibility as a
nation based on laws.
To Be Continued.... with 'Part Four - The Octopus'...
