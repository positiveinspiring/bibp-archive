# The Enemy-Industrial Complex - How to Turn a World Lacking in Enemies 
into The Most Threatening Place in The Universe

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_globalmilitarism165.htm

The communist enemy, with the worlds
fourth largest military, has been
trundling missiles around and threatening the United States with
nuclear obliteration.
Guam, Hawaii,
Washington: all, it claims, are targetable.
The coverage in the media has been
hair-raising. The U.S. is
rushing an untested missile defense system to Guam, deploying
missile-interceptor ships off the South Korean coast,
sending nuclear capable B-2 Stealth bombers thousands of miles
on mock bombing runs,
pressuring China, and conducting large-scale
war games with its South Korean ally.
Only one small problem: there is as yet
little evidence that the enemy with a few nuclear weapons facing
off (rhetorically at least) against an American arsenal of
4,650 of them has the
ability to miniaturize and mount even one on a missile, no less
deliver it accurately, nor does it have a missile capable of
reaching Hawaii or Washington, and I wouldnt count on Guam either.
It also happens to be a desperate
country, one possibly
without enough fuel to fly a modern air force, whose people, on
average, are
inches shorter than their southern neighbors thanks to decades
of intermittent famine and malnutrition, and who are ruled by a
bizarre three-generational family cult. If that other communist,
Karl Marx, hadnt once famously written that history repeats itself
first as tragedy, then as farce, we would have had to invent the
phrase for this very moment.
In the previous century, there were two
devastating global wars, which left significant parts of the planet
in ruins.
There was also a "cold war" between two
superpowers locked in a system of
mutual assured destruction (aptly acronymed as MAD) whose
nuclear arsenals were capable of destroying the planet many times
over.
Had you woken up any morning in the years between
December 7, 1941, and
December 26, 1991, and been told that the leading international
candidate for Americas Public Enemy Number One was Kim Jong-uns
ramshackle, comic-opera regime in North Korea, you might have gotten
down on your hands and knees and sent thanks to pagan gods.
The same would be true for the other
candidates for that number one position since September 11, 2001:
the original al-Qaeda (largely decimated), al-Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula located in poverty-stricken areas of poverty-stricken
Yemen, the Taliban in poverty-stricken Afghanistan, unnamed
jihadis scattered across poverty-stricken areas of North Africa,
or Iran, another rickety regional power run by not particularly
adept theocrats.
All these years, weve been launching
wars and pursuing a global war on terror."
Weve poured money into
national security as if there were no tomorrow. From
our police to
our borders, weve up-armored everywhere. We constantly hear
about threats to us and to the homeland.
And yet, when you knock on the door
marked Enemy, theres seldom anyone home.
Few in this country have found this
striking. Few seem to notice any disjuncture between the
enemy-ridden, threatening, and deeply dangerous world we have been
preparing ourselves for (and fighting in) this last decade-plus and
the world as it actually is, even those who lived through
significant parts of the last anxiety-producing, bloody century.
You know that feeling when you wake up
and realize youve had the same recurrent nightmare yet again?
Sometimes, theres an equivalent in
waking life, and heres mine: every now and then, as I read about,
-
the next move in the spreading war on terror
-
the next drone
assassination
-
the next ratcheting up of the surveillance game
-
the
next expansion of the secrecy that envelops our government
-
the next
set of expensive actions taken to guard us,
... - all of this justified
by the enormous threats and dangers that we face - I think to
myself: Wheres the enemy?
And then I wonder: Just what kind of a
dream is this that were dreaming?
A door marked enemy and no one
home
Lets admit it: enemies can have their
uses. And lets admit as well that its in the interest of some in
our country that we be seen as surrounded by constant and imminent
dangers on an enemy-filled planet.
Lets also admit that the world is and
always will be a dangerous place in all sorts of ways.
Still, in American terms, the
bloodlettings, the devastations of this new century and the last
years of the previous one have been remarkably minimal or distant;
some of the worst, as in the multi-country war over the Congo with
its
more than five million dead have passed us by entirely; some,
even when we launched them, have essentially been imperial frontier
conflicts, as in Iraq and Afghanistan, or interventions of little
cost (to us) as in Libya, or frontier patrolling operations as in
Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Northern Africa.
(It was no mistake that, when Washington
launched its special operations raid on Abbottabad, Pakistan, to get
Osama bin Laden, it was given the
code name Geronimo and the message from the SEAL team
recording his death was Geronimo-E KIA or enemy killed in
action.)
And lets admit as well that, in the
wake of those wars and operations, Americans now have more enemies,
more angry, embittered people who would like to do us harm than
on
September 2001.
Lets accept that somewhere out there are people
who, as
George W. Bush once
liked to say, hate us" and what we stand for. (I leave just
what we actually stand for to you, for the moment.)
So lets consider those enemies briefly.
Is there a major state, for instance, that falls into this category,
like any of the great warring imperial European powers from the
sixteenth century on, or Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in World
War II, or the Soviet Union of the Cold War era? Of course not.
There was admittedly a period when, in
order to pump up what we faced in the world, analogies to World War
II and the Cold War were rife.
There was, for instance, George W.
Bushs famed rhetorical construct,
the Axis of Evil (Iraq, Iran, and North Korea), patterned by his
speechwriter on the German-Italian-Japanese axis of World War II.
It was, of course, a joke construct, if reality was your yardstick.
Iraq and Iran were then enemies. (Only in the wake of the U.S.
invasion and occupation of Iraq have they become
friends and allies.)
And North Korea had nothing whatsoever
to do with either of them. Similarly, the American occupation of
Iraq was once regularly
compared to the U.S. occupations of Germany and Japan, just as
Saddam Hussein had
long been presented as a modern Hitler.
In addition, al-Qaeda-style Islamists
were regularly referred to as
Islamofascists, while certain military and neocon types with a
desire to turn the war on terror into a successor to the Cold War
took to calling it the
long war, or even World
War IV.
But all of this was so wildly out of whack that it
simply faded away.
As for whos behind that door marked
Enemy, if you opened it, what would you
find? As a start, scattered hundreds or, as the years have gone
by, thousands of jihadis, mostly in the poorest backlands of
the planet and with little ability to do anything to the United
States.
Next, there were a few minority
insurgencies, including the Taliban and allied forces in Afghanistan
and separate Sunni and Shia ones in Iraq.
There also have been tiny numbers of
wannabe Islamic terrorists in the U.S. (once you take away the
string of
FBI sting operations that have regularly turned hopeless
slackers and lost teenagers into the most dangerous of fantasy
Muslim plotters).
And then, of course, there are those two
relatively hapless regional powers, Iran and North Korea, whose bark
far exceeds their potential bite.
The Wizard of Oz on 9/11
The U.S., in other words, is probably in
less danger from external enemies than at any moment in the last
century.
There is no other imperial power on the
planet capable of, or desirous of, taking on American power
directly, including China. Its true that, on September 11, 2001, 19
hijackers with box cutters produced a remarkable, apocalyptic, and
devastating TV show in which
almost 3,000 people died.
When those giant towers in downtown New
York collapsed, it certainly
had the
look of nuclear disaster (and in those first days, the media was
filled was nuclear-style references), but it wasnt actually an
apocalyptic event.
The enemy was still nearly nonexistent.
The act
cost bin Laden only an estimated $400,000-$500,000, though it
would lead to a series of
trillion-dollar wars. It was a nightmarish event that had a
malign
Wizard of Oz quality to it: a tiny man producing giant effects.
It in no way endangered the state.
In fact, it would actually strengthen
many of its powers.
It put a hit on the economy, but a
passing one. It was a spectacular and spectacularly gruesome act of
terror by a small, murderous organization then capable of mounting a
major operation somewhere on Earth only once every couple of years.
It was meant to spread fear, but nothing more.
When the towers came down and you could
suddenly see to the horizon, it was still, in historical terms,
remarkably enemy-less. And yet 9/11 was experienced here as a Pearl
Harbor moment - a sneak attack by a terrifying enemy meant to
disable the country.
The next day, newspaper headlines were
filled with
variations on A Pearl Harbor of the Twenty-First Century.
If it was a repeat of December 7, 1941,
however, it lacked an imperial Japan or any other state to declare
war on, although one of the weakest partial states on the planet,
the Talibans Afghanistan, would end up filling the bill adequately
enough for Americans.
To put this in perspective, consider two
obvious major dangers in U.S. life: suicide by gun and death by car.
In 2010, more than
19,000 Americans killed themselves using guns. (In the same
year, there were only 11,000 homicides nationwide.) In 2011,
32,000 Americans died in traffic accidents (the lowest figure in 60
years, though it was again
on the rise in the first six months of 2012).
In other words, Americans accept without
blinking the equivalent yearly of more than six 9/11s in
suicides-by-gun and more than 10 when it comes to vehicular deaths.
Similarly, had the underwear bomber, to
take one post-9/11 example of terrorism, succeeded in downing
Flight 253 and murdering its 290 passengers, it would have been
a horrific act of terror; but he and his compatriots would have had
to bring down 65 planes to reach the annual level of weaponized
suicides and more than 110 planes for vehicular deaths.
And yet no one has declared war on
either the car or the gun (or the companies that make them or the
people who sell them).
No one has built a massive,
nearly trillion-dollar car-and-gun-security-complex to deal with
them. In the case of guns, quite the opposite is true, as the
post-Newtown debate over gun control has made all too clear. On both
scores, Americans have decided to live with perfectly real dangers
and the staggering carnage that accompanies them, constraining them
on occasion or sometimes not at all.
Despite the carnage of 9/11, terrorism
has been a
small-scale American danger in the years since, worse than shark
attacks, but not much else.
Like a wizard, however, what Osama bin
Laden and his suicide bombers did that day was create an instant
sense of an enemy,
-
so big, so powerful, that
Americans found war a reasonable response
-
big enough for those who wanted
an international police action against al-Qaeda to be
laughed out of the room
-
big enough to launch an invasion
of revenge against Iraq, a country unrelated to al-Qaeda
-
big enough, in fact, to
essentially declare war on the world
It took next to no time for top
administration officials to begin talking about targeting
60 countries, and as journalist Ron Suskind
has reported, within six days of the attack, the CIA had topped
that figure, presenting President Bush with a Worldwide Attack
Matrix, a plan that targeted terrorists in 80 countries.
Whats remarkable is how little the
disjuncture between the scope and scale of the global war that was
almost instantly launched and the actual enemy at hand was ever
noted here. You could certainly make a reasonable argument that, in
these years, Washington has largely fought no one - and lost.
Everywhere it went, it created enemies
who had, previously, hardly existed and the process is
ongoing.
Had you been able to time-travel back to
the Cold War era to inform Americans that, in the future, our major
enemies would be in Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Mali, Libya, and so
on, they would surely have thought you mad (or lucky indeed).
Creating an enemy-industrial
complex
Without an enemy of commensurate size
and threat, so much that was done in Washington in these years might
have been unattainable.
The vast national security
building and spending spree - stretching from the Virginia
suburbs of Washington, where the National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency erected its new
$1.8 billion headquarters, to Bluffdale, Utah, where the
National Security Agency is still
constructing a
$2 billion, one-million-square-foot data center for storing the
worlds intercepted communications - would have been unlikely.
Without the fear of an enemy capable of
doing anything, money at ever escalating levels would never have
poured into homeland security, or the Pentagon, or a growing complex
of crony corporations associated with our weaponized safety.
The exponential growth of the national
security complex, as well as of
the powers of the executive branch when it comes to national
security matters, would have far been less likely.
Without 9/11 and the perpetual wartime
that followed, along with the heavily promoted threat of terrorists
ready to strike and potentially capable of wielding biological,
chemical, or even nuclear weapons, we wouldn't have,
For all of this to happen, there had to
be an enemy-industrial complex as well, a network of crucial figures
and institutions ready to pump up the threat we faced and convince
Americans that we were in a world so dangerous that rights, liberty,
and privacy were small things to sacrifice for American safety.
In
short, any number of interests from Bush administration figures
eager to sweep
it all up and do whatever they wanted in the world to weapons
makers, lobbyists, surveillance outfits, think tanks,
military intellectuals, assorted pundits... well, the whole
national and homeland security racket and its various hangers-on had
an interest in beefing up the enemy.
For them, it was important in
the post-9/11 era that threats would never again lack a capital T
or a hefty dollar sign.
And dont forget
a media that was ready
to pound the drums of war and emphasize what dangerous enemies
lurked in our world with remarkably few second thoughts.
Post-9/11,
major media outlets were generally prepared to take the
enemy-industrial complexs word for it and play every new terrorist
incident as if it were potentially the end of the world.
Increasingly as the years went on, jobs, livelihoods, an expanding
world of security depended on the continuance of all this,
depended, in short, on the injection of
regular doses of fear into the body politic.
That was the favor Osama bin Laden did
for Washingtons national security apparatus and the Bush
administration on that fateful September morning.
He engraved an
argument in the American brain that would live on indelibly for
years, possibly decades, calling for eternal vigilance at any cost
and on a previously unknown scale.
As the
Project for the New
American Century (PNAC), that
neocon think-tank-cum-shadow-government, so fatefully put it in
"Rebuilding America's Defenses" a year before the 9/11 attacks:
Further, the process of transformation [of the military], even if
it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent
some catastrophic and catalyzing event - like a new Pearl Harbor.
So when the new Pearl Harbor arrived out
of the blue, with many PNAC members (from Vice President
Dick Cheney
on down) already in office, they naturally saw their chance.
They
created an al-Qaeda on steroids and launched their global war to
establish a Pax Americana, in the Middle East and then
perhaps globally.
They were aware that they lacked opponents of the
stature of those of the previous century and, in their
documents, they made it clear that they were planning to ensure
no future great-power-style enemy or bloc of enemy-like nations
would arise. Ever.
For this, they needed an American public
anxious, frightened, and ready to pay. It was, in other words, in
their interest to manipulate us. And if that were all there were to
it, our world would be a grim, but simple enough place. As it
happens, its not.
Ruling elites, no matter what power they have,
dont work that way. Before they manipulate us, they almost
invariably manipulate themselves.
I was convinced of this years ago by a
friend who had spent a lot of time reading early Cold War documents
from the National Security Council - from, that is, a small group of
powerful governmental figures writing to and for each other in the
utmost secrecy.
As he told me then and wrote in Washingtons
China, the smart book he did on the early U.S. response to the
establishment of the Peoples Republic of China, what struck him in
the documents was the crudely anti-communist language those men used
in private with each other.
It was the sort of anti-communism you
might otherwise have assumed Washingtons ruling elite would only
have wielded to manipulate ordinary Americans with fears of
Communist subversion, the enemy within, and Soviet plans to take
over the world. (In fact, they and others like them would use just
such language to inject fear into the body politic in those early
Cold War years, that era of McCarthyism.)
They were indeed manipulative men, but
before they influenced other Americans they assumedly underwent
something like a process of collective auto-hypnotism in which they
convinced one another of the dangers they needed the American people
to believe in.
There is evidence that a similar process took place
in the aftermath of 9/11.
From the flustered look on George W.
Bushs face as his plane took him not toward but
away from Washington on September 11, 2001, to the image of Dick
Cheney, in those early months, being
chauffeured around Washington in an armored motorcade with a
gas mask and a biochemical survival suit" in the backseat, you
could sense that the enemy loomed large and omnipresent for them.
They were, that is, genuinely scared, even if they were also ready
to make use of that fear for their own ends.
Or consider
the issue of Saddam
Husseins supposed weapons of mass destruction, that excuse for the
invasion of Iraq. Critics of the invasion are generally quick to
point out how that bogus issue was used by the top officials of the
Bush administration to gain public support for a course that they
had already chosen.
After all, Cheney and his men
cherry-picked the evidence to make their case, even
formed their own secret intel outfit to give them what they
needed, and ignored facts at hand that brought their version of
events into question.
They publicly claimed in an
orchestrated way that Saddam had active nuclear and WMD
programs. They spoke in the most open ways of potential
mushroom clouds from (nonexistent) Iraqi nuclear weapons rising
over American cities, or of those same cities being
sprayed with (nonexistent) chemical or biological weapons from
(nonexistent) Iraqi drones. They certainly had to know that some of
this information was useful but bogus.
Still, they had clearly also
convinced themselves that, on taking Iraq, they would indeed find
some Iraqi WMD to justify their claims.
In his soon-to-be-published book,
Dirty Wars, Jeremy Scahill cites the conservative journalist
Rowan Scarborough on Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfelds growing
post-invasion irritation over the search for Iraqi WMD sites.
Each
morning, wrote Scarborough, the crisis action team had to report
that another location was a bust. Rumsfeld grew angrier and angrier.
One officer quoted him as saying, They must be there! At one
briefing, he picked up the briefing slides and tossed them back at
the briefers.
In other words, those top officials
hustling us into their global war and their long-desired invasion of
Iraq had also hustled themselves into the same world with a similar
set of fears.
This may seem odd, but given the workings of the human
mind, its ability to comfortably hold potentially contradictory
thoughts most of the time without disturbing itself greatly, its
not.
A similar phenomenon undoubtedly took
place in the larger national security establishment where
self-interest combined easily enough with fear. After all, in the
post-9/11 era, they were promising us one thing: something close to
100% safety
when it came to one small danger in our world -
terrorism.
The fear that the next underwear bomber might get through
surely had the American public - but also the American security
state - in its grips.
After all, who loses the most if another shoe
bomber strikes, another ambassador
goes down, another 9/11 actually happens? Whose job, whose
world, will be at stake then?
They may indeed be a crew of
Machiavellis, but they are also acolytes in the cult of terror and
global war. They live in the Cathedral of the Enemy. They were the
first believers and they will undoubtedly be the last ones as well.
They are invested in the importance of the enemy. Its their
religion.
They are, after all, the enemy-industrial complex and if
we are in their grip, so are they.
The comic strip character Pogo once
famously declared:
We have met the enemy and he is
us.
How true. We just dont know it yet...
