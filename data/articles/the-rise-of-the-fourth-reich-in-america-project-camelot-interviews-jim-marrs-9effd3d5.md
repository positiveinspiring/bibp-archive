Jim Marrs - an amiable Texan with
twinkling eyes and a mind like a steel trap - is a veteran researcher and
speaker on all topics connected with the agenda of the
New World Order.
The books that Jim has authored represent his range of interests clearly:
Jim's broad span of research encompasses
Egyptian and Sumerian mythology, Nazi technology, the ET presence, modern
geopolitical analysis, the power of the military-industrial complex, the
Illuminati, and what one might call the real history of the twentieth
century.
Jim sees the big picture clearly, has great command of detail, and is one of
the strongest speakers on the lecture circuit today.
The title of this video - The Rise of the Fourth
Reich in America - tells its own story, and in this 75 minute interview Jim
lays out the compelling and disturbing evidence that while most people
thought the Second World War ended in 1945, the Nazis were never stopped in
their agenda - which can only be understood when one considers how they were
assisted in coming to power by those Controllers who plan in terms
of generations... not terms of government office.
