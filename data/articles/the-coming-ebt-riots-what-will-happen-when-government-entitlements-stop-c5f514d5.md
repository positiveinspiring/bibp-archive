EBT cards are modern-day food stamps, except
they're electronic.
In essence, they are government-issued debit
cards that allow recipients to spend taxpayer money for their own
groceries. But EBT cards aren't merely good on food staples like beans and
rice, they can be spent on processed junk food that promotes diabetes
and obesity.
That's the "dirty little secret" of the EBT
scheme: It encourages low-income Americans to become high-profit customers
of the pharmaceutical industry by eating their way to obesity, diabetes,
cancer and heart disease.
That's why the food industry loves EBT cards, too: Most EBT users are
low-education consumers who understand virtually nothing about nutrition.
They tend to buy the most nutritionally-depleted processed foods available,
and that equates to high-profit foods for the processed food
industry. (The highest-profit foods are the ones with the least nutrition,
it turns out.)
EBT stands for "Electronic Benefit Transfer," and it means transferring
money from the pockets of working taxpayers into the hands of those who, for
one reason or another, are either not working at all or are living below the
poverty requirements set by the government.
This transference is done at gunpoint,
essentially, through the enforcement of federal tax collection.
EBT benefits have
more than doubled during the Obama administration's last four years,
creating tens of millions of new dependents who now vote based almost
entirely on who gives them the most handouts.
The purchase of vitamins is specifically prohibited by the EBT program.
This is done as a way to keep EBT recipients
sick and diseased while suffering from nutritional deficiencies, which
is precisely what the federal government wants.
EBT
cards are also a form of corporate welfare
EBT cards create high-profit handouts to
corporations, too:
-
Pharmaceutical companies and the
sick-care industry
-
Big Government which gets re-elected
based on entitlement handouts
-
Global banks which earn a percentage off
every swipe
-
even the processed junk food industry
which preys upon nutritional ignorance of the poor
In fact, for every dollar's worth of food handed
out to EBT recipients under the program, at least 50 cents is driven right
into the profit coffers of wealthy corporations.
That's why EBT programs are allowed to exist:
Not because they benefit the poor, but because they benefit the rich! Do you
have any idea how much profit there is in a package of Oreo cookies?
The "EBT culture" of dependence, poverty and ignorance is perhaps best shown
in the now-famous
YouTube music video "My EBT".
There, a rapper brags about how he's using
taxpayer money to buy Oreos, chips, sandwiches, breakfast cereals,
McDonald's food and more. He sings about how he wishes he could use it to
buy weed.
This article, however, isn't about how welfare creates long-term dependence
and poverty while destroying the dignity of many who come to depend on it.
Rather, it's about what's going to happen when the EBT card system goes down
and stays down.
EBT food stamp systems goes down for hours
across multiple states
Yesterday, the EBT card system, which is managed
by JP Morgan Chase, suffered
a six-hour outage across ten states.
Wal-Mart, one of the favorite destinations of EBT card users, proceeded to
run transactions manually and then batched them into the JP Morgan Chase
processing system once the system came back online.
But elsewhere, stores
were met with growing frustration from EBT card holders who were
angry that their
government money cards suddenly stopped working.
In this case, the EBT outage only lasted less than one day.
But given that
they are tied into a globalist bank which looks almost certain to fail once
the global debt collapse
unfolds, the question of the day is this:
What's going to happen when the
bank running all the EBT transactions goes belly up?
What happens when the free EBT money stops?
Remember how Obama supporters threatened to riot
in the streets if Romney won the recent presidential election?
There's a
huge class of Americans who have become so dependent on the system of
government handouts that they have no ability to survive any other way. These people will
riot when the free money is cut off.
As Ron Paul explained in his recent
farewell speech, the entitlements must sooner or later come to an end:
The wealth we see today is based on debt and a foolish willingness on the
part of foreigners to take our dollars for goods and services.
They then
loan them back to us to perpetuate our debt system. It's amazing that it has
worked for this long but the impasse in Washington, in solving our problems
indicate that many are starting to understand the seriousness of the world-wide debt crisis and the dangers we face.
The longer this process continues
the harsher the outcome will be.
Many are now acknowledging that a financial crisis looms but few understand
it's, in reality, a moral crisis. It's the moral crisis that has allowed our
liberties to be undermined and permits the exponential growth of illegal
government power.
Without a clear understanding of the nature of the crisis
it will be difficult to prevent a steady march toward tyranny and the
poverty that will accompany it.
EBT card users are almost universally incapable of understanding the complex
economics Ron Paul is describing.
All they understand is that their next
meal comes from a piece of plastic that "counts as money" at the local
corner store. They do not grasp the long-term vulnerability of that system
and how it is tied into a global debt scheme whose days are numbered.
Furthermore, EBT card users almost universally
have no backup plan.
They live meal by meal, with no financial safety net, no financial planning,
and absolutely zero savings.
In fact, having any real savings disqualifies you from receiving an EBT card, which is another way that
Big Government actually encourages financial dependence among EBT card
recipients.
The EBT false flag riots
Why is all this important to understand? Because
on the day the EBT cards are shut off, there will be mass riots of EBT
card recipients who are suddenly thrust into an emergency.
In fact, shutting off the
EBT cards is
actually one way to initiate
a false flag event in America.
It works like
this:
-
Purposely shut off all EBT cards. (Takes just two seconds at JP Morgan.)
-
Blame it on a cyber terrorist attack and use the crisis to institute
harsh new police state controls over the internet. ("Never let a good crisis
go to waste...")
-
Allow the "EBT riots"
to unfold. Keep the National Guard away for long enough to let things get
out of control and have scary footage broadcast on the evening news.
-
Once things are bad enough,
announce Martial Law and bring in the
troops to turn America's streets into a Nazi-style police state surveillance
and enforcement system, complete with TSA-run checkpoints on all major
roads.
What's required to make this happen? Nothing more than turning off the EBT
cards for 72 hours.
That's it...!
It's just a single change to a single line of
code at JP Morgan Chase, and it's mission accomplished for the globalists.
Yesterday's EBT outage, in fact, may have been a practice run for the
real thing.
When the globalists want riots to unfold, they now have the tool
to make it happen.
Long term - All entitlements will be cut off or
made worthless through currency debasement
The question of disappearing entitlements isn't
just an EBT card issue, by the way.
The coming financial collapse of the
U.S. government will end all
entitlements,
including social security, Medicare and federal workers' retirement pension
payments.
That's the real kicker in all this: In a society where 50% or so are now
largely dependent on the federal government for their very survival, the
fact that the government is headed into a multi-trillion-dollar debt
blowout should raise red alerts everywhere.
Obama has put the USA on a collision course with a debt implosion, adding
more to the U.S. debt in the last four years than all the Presidents in the
history of America - combined!
And with government spending
continuing to expand beyond all sanity, there is no stopping the coming debt
blowout.
Consider the following U.S. national debt chart:
As you can see from the chart, we are now in a hyperbolic final blowout
of debt that can only lead to a total economic implosion.
Over the next
four years, this chart will get even more insane as Obama spends trillions
of dollars of money we don't have, further accelerating America's head-on
collision with the financial apocalypse.
When that happens, all federal benefits immediately cease.
If you
thought the idea of tens of millions of angry EBT debt card users was bad,
just consider what happens when all the former federal employees don't get
their pension funds anymore. Or if social security checks are eroded down to
the point where they are essentially worthless.
That's when you're going to
see real social unrest across America, and that day is a finite number of
weeks away.
It will arrive as sure as the sun comes up, and when it does
arrive, there's going to be unprecedented chaos in the streets as all the
suckers who lived their lives dependent on the federal government suddenly
come to find out the whole thing was a Ponzi scheme.
Yep: A
Ponzi scheme...
The U.S. government is running the largest Ponzi scheme
in the history of the world, and just like every Ponzi scheme that has ever
existed, it will sooner or later collapse. When that day comes, you will
want to make sure you have stored food, water, silver coins, ammo, emergency
medicine and all the usual preparedness supplies.
And be prepared to defend your supplies from those who refused to prepare.
Because if there's one thing that EBT cards have taught tens of millions of
America, it's that,
"YOUR stuff belongs to THEM!"
