"Karl Marx got it right, at some point
capitalism can destroy itself,"
said Mr. Roubini, in an interview with
The Wall Street Journal.
"We thought markets worked. They're not
working."
The
world economy is in shambles and about to
get worse, according to even mainstream economists. How bad is anybody's
guess.
Some things, however, are certain: the recovery
that politicians have been promising for years existed only in their heads.
The reality of the situation is now apparent to millions of people across
the globe, who, before, clung to the empty promises of economic recovery.
This newfound consciousness will inevitably find expression in the political
realm and, more importantly, the streets.
A key aspect of this sudden mass awareness is in response to high
unemployment and the deeply unpopular measures that politicians are forcing
upon working people, both byproducts of the Great Recession.
Politicians are blaming "the markets" for
demanding austerity measures, but "markets" are simply places where wealthy
people invest their money.
To guarantee a profitable return on their money
these investors demand that labor laws be squashed and social programs be
eliminated, all over the world.
Spain, for example, is one of many countries having austerity measures
forced down their throats.
Reuters reports:
"Analysts see the shaking up of the
country's inflexible labor laws [laws that protect workers] and the
easing of hiring and firing [so older, activist, or slower workers can
be fired] as vital to restoring the country's competitiveness. The labor
reforms are crucial. They will help to restore growth [profits] in the
long term. Growth is the only way out of these adverse fiscal trends,'
said Luigi Speranza, analyst at BNP Paribas."

To summarize, creating new laws that enable
Spanish corporations to work their workers harder will be better for
profits.
Greece faces a similar austerity plan, according to
The Guardian UK:
"Tax increases, spending cuts and wage
reductions and a sweeping privatization program have led to violent
protests in Greece, with many arguing that the International Monetary
Fund and European Union have demanded too high a price for their
financial support."

In the United States, these policies find
expression in the attack against public-sector unions and the targeting of
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid for cuts, while mass unemployment is
allowed to act as a very efficient way to lower wages for all workers.
Politicians have made it clear that economic growth, especially corporate
profits, will increase in response to these anti-worker policies. They are
only partially right. Corporate profits in fact have been on the rise, but
the austerity measures have been responsible for the depressed economies
throughout Europe and the US.
When workers' wages are lowered and social
programs are decimated, working people and the poor are left with little
money for any purchases other than the bare necessities. Without consumer
demand for their products, corporations curtail operations even more.
This global dynamic has been decades in the
making, with the recession having finally forced the issue into the
forefront.
The Reagan and Thatcher administrations were the first Western
representatives during the post-World War II era of this now dominant trend,
which aimed at pushing back the social programs and wages won by the labor
movements. Their policies were in response to the lower corporate growth
rates that began in the 1970s and continue to this day.
Now, all of Europe is suffering because banks
and corporations demand a more profit-friendly business environment:
universal health care and education programs are in jeopardy, plus wages and
other benefits are under attack.
For the wealthy and corporations this is a life-and-death struggle.
The
Great Recession has already bankrupted the banks and corporations who were
not fit enough to survive under a crumbling market economy. The existing
companies are thus forced to squeeze more work for less pay out of their
workers, since labor is the most flexible cost of any business.
Pushing labor costs down - and by extension
cutting social programs - is thus the priority of the corporations and their
paid-for politicians across the globe, since the global economy is tightly
connected and they all play by the vicious rules of the market. In fact, the
intensity with which the corporate elite is pursuing these policies is a
reflection of their negative outlook for the global economy.
This constitutes a new era in global capitalism, one that mimics the market
economy of past generations.
The 2008 recession was not a temporary
phenomenon, but the ushering in of a new period in which
the corporate elite
attempt to restructure social relations, meaning that past assumptions
regarding wages and social programs must be destroyed, as a new, more
profitable equilibrium is sought between the corporate elite and working
people.
Implied in this nation-by-nation restructuring is a restriction of
democracy, since these anti-worker policies negatively affect the vast
majority of the population.
The riots in London are an expression of this,
as are the mass demonstrations throughout Europe as well as the Middle East.
In the United States, democracy is circumvented via the so-called Super
Congress, whose duty it is to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
Austerity programs throughout Europe are being
implemented against the wishes of the general working populations.
Also included in this attack on working people is the corporate elite's
doubled efforts to divert the working-class anger toward fake populist
movements - like
the Tea Party in the US - or against minorities, such as
Muslims and immigrants in the US.
This will require that working people stay focused on who exactly is
attacking them, while focusing on measures that can serve as alternatives to
what the corporate elite are forcefully implementing.
The most immediate and important demand of working people must be taxing the
rich and corporations, since social programs need to be funded and expanded
and a massive jobs program with a strong green component is desperately
overdue.
It's not by coincidence that taxing the rich is
rarely used in austerity plans; and when, on rare occasions, the rich are
taxed, it's at low levels with high publicity, so the angry public will
think the illusion of "shared sacrifice" is a reality.
For example, in the US, President
Obama is again calling to end the
Bush tax
cuts for the rich (after allowing them to continue less than a year ago).
It
is doubtful that the
Bush tax cuts will be ended, but if they were, it would
be insufficient. Working people must demand that taxes on the rich be raised
to at least pre-Reagan levels (70 percent), while President Eisenhower
levels would be best (90 percent).
Over the decades, the tax burden has shifted
dramatically, causing wealth to accumulate into the bank accounts of the top
1 percent of the population, the same people who are now demanding that
social programs be destroyed so that their investments are secured and their
corporate profits remain high.
Since illusions of an economic recovery have now been shattered, it's up to
working people to demand that their labor unions and community groups unite
to tax the rich and corporations in order to finance a massive jobs program.
Fortunately,
the AFL-CIO is organizing actions
for the first week of October to demand jobs and oppose cuts to,
-
Social
Security
-
Medicare
-
Medicaid
Many within the labor movement are calling
for massive demonstrations across the country for October 1.
It will take these types of actions to unite
working people to fight for a positive solution to the economic crisis.
