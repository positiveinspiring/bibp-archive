Lobaczewski and The Origins of Political Ponerology
15 Feb 2010
Beginning immediately after World War II and continuing in the decades after
the imposition of Soviet dictatorship on the countries of Eastern Europe, a
group of scientists - primarily Polish, Czech, and Hungarian - secretly
collaborated on a scientific study of the nature of totalitarianism.
Blocked by the State Security Services from
contact with the West, their work remained secret, even while American
researchers like Hervey Cleckley and Gustave Gilbert were
struggling with the same questions.1
The last known living member of this group, a
Polish psychologist and expert on psychopathy named
Andrzej Łobaczewski
(1921-2007), would eventually name their new science - a synthesis of
psychological, psychiatric, sociological, and historical studies - "ponerology",
a term he borrowed from the priests of the Benedictine Abbey in the historic
Polish village of Tyniec.
Derived from poneros in New Testament
Greek, the word suggests an inborn evil with a corrupting influence, a
fitting description of psychopathy and its social effects.
Most of what we know about this research comes from precious few sources.
Łobaczewski's sole contact with the researchers was through Stefan Szuman
(1889 - 1972), a retired professor who passed along anonymous summaries of
research between members of the group. The consequences for being discovered
doing this type of forbidden research were severe; scientists faced arrest,
torture, and even death, so strict conspiracy amongst their little group was
essential. They safeguarded themselves and their work by sharing their work
anonymously.
This way, if any were arrested and tortured,
they could not reveal names and locations of others, a very real threat to
their personal safety and the completion of the work.
Łobaczewski only
shared the names of two Polish professors of the previous generation who
were involved in the early stages of the work,
Błachowski died under suspicious circumstances
and Łobaczewski speculates that he was murdered by the State police for his
part in the research.
Dąbrowski emigrated and, unwilling to renounce his
Polish citizenship in order to work in the United States, took a position at
the University of Alberta in Canada, where he was able to have dual
citezenship.
A close reading of Dąbrowski's published works
in English shows the theoretical roots of what would become ponerology.3
Like Lobaczewski, Dąbrowski considered psychopathy to be,
"the greatest obstacle in development of
personality and social groups".4
He warned,
"The general inability to recognize the
psychological type of such individuals [i.e. psychopaths] causes immense
suffering, mass terror, violent oppression, genocide and the decay of
civilization...
As long as the suggestive [i.e. hypnotic, charming,
"spellbinding"] power of the psychopaths is not confronted with facts
and with moral and practical consequences of his doctrine, entire social
groups may succumb to his demagogic appeal".5
In perhaps the first explicit mention of
"political psychopathy", he remarked that the extreme of ambition and lust
for power and financial gain "is particularly evident in criminal or
political psychopathy":6
Methods are developed for spreading
dissension between groups (as in the maxim "divide et impera" [divide
and rule]). Treason and deceit in politics are given justification and
are presented as positive values.
Principles of taking advantage of
concrete situations are also developed. Political murder, execution of
opponents, concentration camps and genocide are the product of political
systems at the level of primary integration [i.e. psychopathy].7
In a passage decades before its time, he
observed that less "successful" psychopaths are to be found in prisons,
while successful ones are to be found in positions of power (i.e., "among
political and military national leaders, labor union bosses, etc.").
He cited two examples of leaders characterized
by this "affective retardation", Hitler and Stalin, to whom he referred
repeatedly in his books8 and who both showed a,
"lack of empathy, emotional
coldness, unlimited ruthlessness and craving for power".9
Dąbrowski and Łobaczewski experienced this horror firsthand.
In September
1939, the Nazis invaded Poland using a false-flag operation that has come to
be known as the Gleiwitz Incident. This was part of the larger SS project
Operation Himmler, the purpose of which was to create the illusion of Polish
aggression as the pretext for "retaliation".
In other words, the Germans needed a plausible
excuse or cover story to invade the country. Germans dressed as Poles
attacked a radio station and broadcast anti-German propaganda in addition to
murdering a German-Silesian sympathizer of the Poles, Franciszek Honiok,
and placing his body at the scene.10
The Nazis used these operations to justify the
invasion, after which they instituted a regime of terror that resulted in
the deaths of an estimated six million Poles. As part of a larger goal of
destroying all Polish cultural life, schools were closed and professors were
arrested, sent to concentration camps, and some murdered. Psychiatry was
outlawed.
According to Jason Aronson of Harvard Medical School, the Nazis
murdered the majority of practicing psychiatrists.
Only 38 survived out of approximately 400 alive
before the invasion.11
During this tumultuous time Łobaczewski worked
as a soldier for the Home Army, an underground Polish resistance
organization, and his desire to study psychology grew.
The gothic style school that he would later attend, Jagiellonian University,
suffered greatly during the war years as part of a general program to
exterminate the intellectual elite of the city of Krakow. On November 6,
1939, 144 professors and staff were arrested and sent to concentration
camps. They had been told that they were to attend a mandatory lecture on
German plans for Polish education. Upon arrival, they were arrested in the
lecture hall, along with everyone else present in the building.
Thankfully, due to public protest, the majority
was released a few months later and despite the University having been
looted and vandalized by the Nazis, survivors of the operation managed to
form an underground university in 1942.12
Regular lectures began again in 1945 and it was
probably then that Łobaczewski began his studies under professor of
psychiatry Edward Brzezicki 13,14 Łobaczewski probably also met
Stefan Szuman, a renowned psychologist who taught at Jagiellonian, at
this time.
Szuman later acted as Łobaczewski's
clearinghouse for secret data and research.
While Jagiellonian and the other Polish universities enjoyed three years of
freedom, this quickly ended in 1948 when Poland became a satellite state of
the Soviet Union and the Polish United Workers' Party took full control of
University life. With the establishment of the Polish Democratic Republic,
Poland was placed under the Soviet sphere of influence; medical and
psychiatric services were socialized, and clinical psychiatry reduced to
strictly Pavlovian concepts.
Thus the "Stalinization" of Polish education and
research picked up where Hitler left off. Łobaczewski's class was the last
to be taught by the pre-Communism professors, who were considered
"ideologically incorrect" by the powers that be. It was only in their last
year of schooling that they fully experienced the inhuman "new reality"
which was to inspire the course of Łobaczewski's research for the rest of
his life.
During the three decades he spent living under the Communist dictatorship,
Łobaczewski worked in general and mental hospitals.
The dictatorship provided intensified conditions
and opportunities to improve his skills in clinical diagnosis - essential
skills for coming to terms with this new social reality. He was also able to
give psychotherapy to those who suffered the most under such harsh rule.
Early on, as others involved in the secret research observed Lobaczewski's
interest in psychopathology and the social psychology of totalitarianism, he
became aware that he was not the first to pursue such research and was asked
to join their group.
Originally, he only contributed a small part of
the research, focusing mostly on
psychopathy.
The name of the person responsible for
completing the final synthesis was kept secret, but the work never saw the
light of day. All of Łobaczewski's contacts became inoperative in the
post-Stalin wave of repression in the 1960s and he was left only with the
data that had already come into his possession. All the rest was lost
forever, whether burned or locked in some secret police archive.
Faced with this hopeless situation, he decided to finish the work on his
own. But despite his efforts in secrecy, the political authorities came to
suspect that he possessed "dangerous" knowledge that threatened their power.
One Austrian scientist with whom Łobaczewski had corresponded turned out to
be an agent of the secret police, and Łobaczewski was arrested and tortured
three times during this period.
While working on the first draft in 1968, the
locals of the village in which he was working warned him of an imminent
secret police raid. Łobaczewski had just enough time to burn the work in his
central heating furnace before their arrival.15 Years later, in
1977, the Roman correspondent to Radio Free Europe, to whom Łobaczewski had
spoken about his work, denounced him to the Polish authorities.16
Given the option of a fourth arrest or
"voluntary" exile to the United States, Łobaczewski chose the latter. All
his papers, books, and research materials were confiscated and he left the
country with nothing.
Upon arrival in New York City, the Polish security apparatus utilized their
contacts to block Łobaczewski's access to jobs in his field.
He was terrified to learn that,
"the overt system of suppression I had so
recently escaped was just as prevalent, though more covert, in the
United States."17
In short, the U.S. was infected with the same
sickness and the "freedom" they offered was little more than an illusion.
In the case of scientists living abroad, the
Polish secret police's modus operandi was to suggest certain courses of
action to American Party members, who then gullibly carried them out,
unaware of the real motivations for their actions. Łobaczewski was thus
forced to take a job doing manual labor, writing the final draft of his book
in the early hours before work.
Having lost most of the statistical data and
case studies with his papers, he included only those he could remember and
focused primarily on the observations and conclusions based on his and
others' decades of study, as well as a study of literature written by
sufferers under pathocratic regimes.
Once the book was completed in 1984 and a suitable translation made into
English, he was unable to get it published. The psychology editors told him
it was "too political", and the political editors told him it was "too
psychological".
He enlisted the help of his compatriot,
Zbigniew Brzezinski, who had just previously served as
President Jimmy Carter's National Security Adviser and who initially praised
the book and promised to help get the book published.
Unfortunately, after some time spent
corresponding Brzezinski became silent, responding only to the effect that
it was a pity it hadn't worked out. In Łobaczewski's words,
"he strangled
the matter, treacherously".18
In the end, a small printing of copies for
academics was the only result, and these failed to have any significant
influence on academics and reviewers.
Suffering from severely poor health, Łobaczewski returned to Poland in 1990, where he published another book and
transcribed the manuscript of
Political Ponerology - A Science on the Nature of Evil
Adjusted for Political Purposes onto his computer.
He eventually sent this copy to the editors of
Sott and Red Pill Press, who published the book in 2006. His health once
more failing, he died just over a year later, in November of 2007. While
other scientists conducted important research into these subjects over the
years, Łobaczewski's book remains the most comprehensive and in-depth.
It is truly an underground classic.

The Psychopath's Mask of Sanity
17 Mar 2010
M.C. Roessler 2010
A Wall Street Psychopath?
In 1960 Bernie Madoff founded his
Wall Street firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.
As chairman of its Board of Directors until his
arrest in December of 2008, Madoff saw his firm (and himself) rise to
prominence on Wall Street, developing the technology that became NASDAQ, the
first and largest electronic stock exchange in America, in the process.
A multimillionaire with over $800-million in
shared assets with his wife and high school sweetheart, Ruth Alpern, Madoff
was well-regarded as a financial mastermind and prolific philanthropist. He
exuded an aura of wealth, confidence, and connections, and many trusted him
as a pillar of the community.
Sounds like a great guy, huh?
His humanitarian image was supported by his work for various nonprofit
groups like the American Jewish Congress and Yeshiva University in New York,
the various commissions and boards on which he sat, and the millions he
donated to educational, political, cultural, and medical causes.
As his firm's website made clear at the time (it
has now been removed):
"Clients know that Bernard Madoff has a
personal interest in maintaining the unblemished record of value,
fair-dealing, and high ethical standards that has always been the firm's
hallmark."
It's funny how things change with a little
perspective and a pattern emerges only in retrospect.
It wasn't until
December of 2008 that the public became aware that this "personal interest"
was anything but one of integrity, and that image stopped being taken for
reality.
In a discussion with Condé Nast Portfolio Editor in Chief Joanne Lipman,
Holocaust survivor, Nobel laureate and Madoff victim Elie Wiesel
said:
"I remember that it was a myth that he
created around him... that everything was so special, so unique, that it
had to be secret. It was like a mystical mythology that nobody could
understand... He gave the impression that maybe 100 people belonged to
the club. Now we know thousands of them were cheated by him." 1
In what has been described as the largest
investor fraud ever committed by single person, Madoff defrauded thousands
of investors out of just under $65-billion in an elaborate Ponzi scheme,
paying returns to investors from money paid by other investors, not actual
profits.
By moving funds in such a way, Madoff created an
image of money that rivaled his own as a man of good character. The illusion
of consistent, high returns, lured thousands into a deal too good to be
true, offered by a man too good to be true. According to the media portrayal
of events, Madoff described the investment fund as "one big lie" to his
sons, who promptly informed the authorities.
Madoff was arrested the next day and his assets
were frozen (as were those of his wife and sons later on).
In the aftermath, Madoff had succeeded in
ruining the lives of thousands, driving some victims to suicide. He ended up
pleading guilty to eleven counts of fraud, money laundering, and perjury,
among others. Although Madoff ran his companies with an iron fist and
claimed he was solely responsible for defrauding clients, investigators were
unsatisfied that one person alone could hide fraud on such a massive scale
for so long.
Subsequent investigations have so far placed six
former associates under criminal investigation,2 while multiple lawsuits are
underway against Ruth Madoff and her sons.3
So how did he pull it off?
Jerry Reisman, a prominent New York
lawyer, described Madoff as,
"utterly charming. He was a master at
meeting people and creating this aura. People looked at him as a
superhero." 4
Even when he was scrambling to secure funds to
keep up his dead-end fraud, associates noticed no signs of stress.
In a 2007 roundtable conversation, viewable on
Youtube,5 Madoff makes some telling comments.
Speaking about modern exchange firms, Madoff
coolly says,
"By and large, in today's regulatory
environment, it's virtually impossible to violate rules. This is
something that the public really doesn't understand... It's impossible
for a violation to go undetected. Certainly not for a considerable
amount of time."
This coming from a man who had been doing just
that for years and possibly decades!
No wonder, given his propensity for deceit, that
Madoff and his firm were extremely secretive, finding ways of keeping their
illegal activities hidden, for example, refusing to provide clients online
access to their accounts and ordering employees - against regulations - to
delete email after it had been printed on paper, as reported by Lucinda
Franks in her piece for The Daily Beast.6
Contrary to his illustrious public persona, in an article by Mark Seal for
Vanity Fair,7 various family friends and insiders present an
image of Madoff as a cold-hearted control freak who not only exploited
strangers, but also those closest to him.
He cultivated ostensibly close friendships with
the late Norman F. Levy and philanthropist Carl J. Shapiro while robbing
them blind in the process. Madoff spoke of Levy as his "mentor of 40 years"
and always deferred to him.
In return, Levy considered Madoff his,
"surrogate son, a member of his family."
Carmen Dell'Orefice, Levy's then-girlfriend,
remembers,
"He always did so much for Norman's comfort
in the smallest details."
She described Madoff and his wife as quiet and
inconspicuous and expressed the cognitive dissonance often experienced by
victims of conmen like Madoff when the truth behind the image is finally
revealed:
"I am accepting that what I was experiencing
was a projection of a person who wasn't there... If I didn't take all
the pictures I took all those years, I would say 'Carmen, you're
delusional'."
Levy's son Francis said his father believed in
Madoff:
"If there's one honorable person," he said,
"it's Bernie."
Joseph Kavanu, a former law school peer of
Madoff's shared similar disbelief with Julie Creswell and Landon Thomas Jr.
in their piece for the New York Times:
"It doesn't make sense... I cannot take the
Bernie I knew and turn him into the Bernie we're hearing about 24/7. It
doesn't compute."
In reality, there were two Madoffs:
-
the
carefully cultivated image of the successful businessman and philanthropist
-
the reality: a ruthless and remorseless
criminal who operated behind a mask of sanity, success, and
humanitarianism
One source described to Seal how Madoff ruled his two sons through,
"tough love and fear. People were afraid of
Bernie. He wielded his influence. They were afraid of his temper."
Madoff also ruled his office with an iron fist,
controlling the work environment down to the smallest detail. He was
obsessed with order and control.
A family friend related,
"There was a lot of arrogance in that
family. Bernie would talk to people who were as rich as he was, but he
didn't want to be bothered with the little people."
Another insider said,
"He was imperial, above it all. If he didn't
like the conversation, he would just get up and walk away. It was 'I'm
Bernie Madoff and you're not.'"
Another said,
"Peter [Madoff's brother]
is much more religious, more even-keeled. Bernie is more cocky,
arrogant, a showman. Shrewd like a fox."
From the descriptions of those who knew and
interacted with him, a picture emerges of Bernie Madoff as arrogant,
superficially charming, glib, manipulative, deceitful, emotionally cold,
domineering, and heartless, in short, all the hallmarks of a successful
psychopath.
Unsurprisingly, journalists and experts alike
have suggested exactly that J. Reid Meloy, forensic psychologist and author
of The Psychopathic Mind, Florida forensic psychologist Phil Heller, and
former FBI agent Gregg McCrary, have all said so in print 8 & 9, and several
prominent researchers including Adrian Raine suggested the same at the 2009
conference for the Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy in New
Orleans.
In what I'll show over the course of this series
to be typical psychopathic fashion, Madoff fought his way to the top, wooed
the regulators, and built his fortune by conning those he saw as worthless,
even screwing over his so-called friends.
However, as Meloy told Creswell and Thomas,
"the Achilles' heel of the psychopath is his
sense of impunity. That is, eventually, what will bring him down."
What Is Psychopathy?
Until the publication of Hervey Cleckley's landmark book
The Mask of Sanity in 1941 (along with
its subsequent editions), there wasn't much agreement on what exactly
psychopathy is.
The term had come to describe individuals whose
emotional life and social behavior were abnormal, but whose intellectual
capacities were undisturbed. In contrast to psychotics whose grip on reality
is clearly disturbed, as in paranoid schizophrenia, psychopaths are
completely sane. They have a firm grip on reality, can carry on a
conversation, and often appear more normal than normal.
But at the same time, while talking to you about
the weather or the economy, they may be deciding the best way to con you out
of your life savings or perhaps get you to a secluded location where they
can rape or murder you.
However, while psychopaths may be intellectually aware that their actions
grossly violate the limits of normal human behavior, they lack the emotional
engagement with others that normally acts as an inhibitor of anti-social
acts, like calculated aggression, intentional intimidation, pathological
lying and emotional manipulation.
In the course of his (or her, as probably one in
four psychopaths is female) development, the psychopath's inability to feel
and thus identify with the emotions of others blocks the development of a
"moral sense" that allows normal individuals to care for others and treat
them like thinking and feeling beings.
Psychopaths just don't care. To them people are
things, objects.
When they're no longer useful they can be
discarded or destroyed without a second thought.
The jarring disconnect between the absolutely normal (if not more than
normal) face with which the psychopath greets the world, and the utterly
unfathomable irrationality and inhumanity of his actions has led to their
being called "wolves in sheep's clothing" and "snakes in suits".
Cleckley coined the phrase "mask of sanity" to
illustrate the disparity between the image of normality and the psychopath's
essential abnormality.
While the label has come to be almost strictly
associated with serial killers, rapists and arch-villains, Cleckley was
quick to point out that the vast majority of psychopaths are not violent,
and,
"only a small proportion of typical
psychopaths are likely to be found in penal institutions, since the
typical patient... is not likely to commit major crimes that result in
long prison terms."10
Their actions are antisocial in that they
violate the almost universally agreed upon "rules" of social behavior.
Of
course, this often takes the form of crime, but many psychopaths operate
successfully within the boundaries of the law, wreaking havoc
interpersonally or monetarily.
After years of frequently encountering psychopaths in clinical practice and
witnessing the immense suffering they inflict upon those who happen to fall
within their sphere of influence, Cleckley identified several universal
traits.
On the one hand psychopaths are superficially
charming and of good intelligence. They lack any delusions or other signs of
irrational thinking and are free of nervousness and anxiety. In other words,
they present an image of good "mental health" that can disarm even the most
experienced judge of human character. However, a close analysis of their
life history and interactions with others reveals some striking deficits
beneath the mask.
Psychopaths are also notoriously insincere,
liberally inserting lies and innuendo into their talkative stream that
usually go unnoticed. They are usually impulsive, acting on whims, and
seeming to live entirely in the present, unhindered by concerns for past
failures and future consequences.
As such they often show remarkably poor judgment
and an inability to learn from punishments or the threat of future ones
(psychopathic criminals have the highest recidivism rates). They are
unreliable, often moving from job to job and city to city, finding new
victims and living parasitically off of others' kindness and naiveté. They
also have a pathological sense of entitlement. The center of their own
universe, they are incapable of love, lack any sense of remorse or shame,
and show a general poverty of any deep emotional life.
This is the core feature, shared equally by all
psychopaths: the inability to feel empathy.
While Cleckley did much to bring light on the issue, in the preface to the
fifth and final edition of his book he described "an almost universal
conspiracy of evasion" of the topic of psychopathy among North American
researchers and clinicians.
While institutions exist to deal with illness
and crime, when it comes to psychopathy,
"no measure is taken at all... nothing
exists specifically designed to meet a major and obvious pathologic
situation."11
Psychopathy arguably accounts for a grossly
disproportionate amount of damage to society.
Cleckley was convinced that the first step to
deal with this immense problem was to "focus general interest" and "promote
awareness of its tremendous importance."12
Thankfully, significant contributions have been
made in recent years towards such a goal by writers like Robert Hare
and Paul Babiak, clinicians Martha Stout and Sandra Brown,
and popular media portrayals such as the documentaries,
The Corporation and
I,
Psychopath.
Unfortunately, even with these efforts, public
knowledge about psychopathy still falls far short of ideal, the "conspiracy
of evasion" persists, and the problem rages on. For a disorder affecting
more people than schizophrenia,13 and causing exponentially more
harm to society, the fact that psychopathy is not a generally understood
concept is alarming.
Robert D. Hare, Professor Emeritus of psychology at the University of
British Columbia, wrote a book in 1970 summarizing the research available at
the time. Since then, he has been at the forefront of psychopathy research,
developing the first valid measure of criminal psychopathy, the Psychopathy
Checklist (PCL-R), and writing two bestsellers on the subject: Without
Conscience in 1993 and Snakes in Suits (co-authored with Paul Babiak) in
2006.
Working with criminal populations, Hare further
refined Cleckley's list of psychopathic traits for the PCL-R, settling on
twenty characteristics of a prototypical psychopath.
Whereas Cleckley described his psychopathic patients as "carr[ying] disaster
lightly in each hand" and "not deeply vicious",14 Hare's Without Conscience
presents a much more malevolent look into the mind of the criminal
psychopath.
As he puts it:
"Psychopaths have what it takes to defraud
and bilk others: They are fast-talking, charming, self-assured, at ease
in social situations, cool under pressure, unfazed by the possibility of
being found out, and totally ruthless... Psychopaths are generally well
satisfied with themselves and with their inner landscape, bleak as it
may seem to outside observers."15
They see empathy, remorse, and a sense of
responsibility - all the qualities usually considered as the epitome of
goodness and humanity - as signs of weakness to be exploited; laws and
social rules as inconvenient restrictions on their freedom; and antisocial
behavior as deliberate "nonconformity", a refusal to "program" by society's
artificial standards.
Love, kindness, guilt, and altruism strike the
psychopath as comical and childish naiveties for "bleeding hearts", and
psychopathic serial murderer Ted Bundy even called guilt,
"an illusion... a kind of social-control
mechanism."16
While they may convincingly profess to love in
the most romantic and meaningful verbosity to their partners, these displays
are soon replaced with domination and exploitation, as Sandra Brown shows in
her 2009 book Women Who Love Psychopaths.
Psychopaths see normal life as dull and boring, a dog-eat-dog world in which
potential enemies (i.e. you and me) are to be manipulated, and aggression
used as a tool to establish their superiority and take what is rightfully
theirs - to satisfy their grandiose sense of entitlement.
Naturally, in a universe of one, Hare observes,
"Obligations and commitments mean nothing to
psychopaths... They do not honor formal or implied commitments to
people, organizations, or principles."17
They may very well ask,
"What's so bad about being articulate,
self-confident, living a fast-paced life on the edge and in the now, and
looking out for number one?"
And in our decaying society, many would not
disagree.
But what the psychopath sees as a carefree life
of excitement and entitlement usually amounts to little more than the
pursuit of immediate moments of pleasure and feelings of power, whether
fleeting or more long-lasting.
With Hare's work, the psychopathic "mask" of sanity and normality acquires a
sinister and Machiavellian tone. That's because psychopaths are conscious of
being different. They see normal people as inferiors - "others" - to be used
and discarded when they are no longer needed. But like a predator among its
prey, psychopaths must disguise themselves to evade detection. If they made
their motives known, others would be horrified.
So, from an early age they learn to fit in by
copying normal human reactions and behaviors.
They learn when it is appropriate to cry, show
grief, guilt, concern, and love. They learn all the facial expressions,
common phrases, and social cues for these emotions they do not feel. And as
such, they deceive others with false displays of sadness, grief, guilt,
concern, and love, and they manipulate our reactions to get what they want.
That's how a psychopath is able to con you out of money by playing on your
sense of pity and compassion.
Normal people, unaware of the differences
between psychopaths and themselves, assume that these displays of emotion
are evidence of actual emotion, and so the psychopath succeeds in going
unnoticed, like a wolf in sheep's clothing.
"[T]he truly talented ones have raised their
ability to charm people to that of an art, priding themselves on their
ability to present a fictional self to others that is convincing, taken
at face value, and difficult to penetrate."18
This "practice" at appearing human is expertly
portrayed in Mary Astor's novel The Incredible Charlie Carewe, which
Cleckley recommended,
"should be read not only by every psychiatrist but also
by every physician" because of its remarkably accurate portrayal of a
psychopath.19
This "act" is a matter of survival for a
psychopath, lest their "inhumanity" be discovered.
After all, most people do not react positively
to a child or adult who potentially can, as Hare put it,
"torture and mutilate [a human being] with
about the same sense of concern that we feel when we carve a turkey."20
Psychopaths also keep up their "psychopathic
fiction" by being charming conversationalists.
They expertly tell "unlikely but convincing"
stories about themselves, easily blending truth with lies. Not only can they
lie effortlessly, they are completely unfazed when caught in a lie. They
simply rework their story, to the befuddlement of those who know the truth.
They may feign remorse, but are equally skilled at rationalizing their
behavior, often portraying themselves as the victims (and blaming the real
victims).
One female psychopath complained that no one
cared about how she felt, having lost both her children. In fact, she was
the one who had murdered them. In cases like this, the mask slips ever so
slightly, as when the less intelligent psychopath attempts to use emotional
concepts he cannot understand.
One inmate told Hare,
"Yeah, sure, I feel remorse [for the
crime]."
However, he didn't,
"feel bad inside about it."21
Even their violent outbursts of "rage" are carefully controlled displays.
One relatively self-aware psychopath revealed,
"There are emotions - a whole spectrum of
them - that I know only through words, through reading and in my
immature imagination. I can imagine I feel these emotions (know,
therefore, what they are), but I do not."22
Another, confused when asked how he felt, was
asked about the physical sensations of emotion and responded,
"Of course! I'm not a robot. I really get
pumped up when I have sex or when I get into a fight."23
Capable of only the most primal body-based
feelings, the psychopath has no intense emotions to be in control of; any
display of such is an act with the intent to manipulate.
As to the causes of this disturbing disorder, researchers are now confident
that, contrary to the once common belief that psychopathy must be caused by
childhood trauma, there is a substantial genetic and biological basis for
psychopathy.
In his 2007 update on the last twenty years of
psychopathy research, Robert Hare comments:
"I might note that the early results from
behavioral genetics research are consistent with the evolutionary
psychology view that psychopathy is less a result of a neurobiological
defect than a heritable, adaptive life-strategy."24
Or, as he put it in Without Conscience:
I think [childhood experiences] play an
important role in shaping what nature has provided [i.e. "a profound
inability to experience empathy and the complete range of emotions"].
Social factors and parenting practices influence the way the disorder
develops and is expressed in behavior.
Thus, an individual with a mix of
psychopathic personality traits who grows up in a stable family and has
access to positive social and educational resources might become a con
artist or white-collar criminal, or perhaps a somewhat shady
entrepreneur, politician, or professional.
Another individual, with much the same
personality traits but from a deprived and disturbed background, might
become a drifter, mercenary, or violent criminal...
One implication of this view for the
criminal justice system is that the quality of family life has much less
influence on the antisocial behaviors of psychopaths than it does on the
behavior of most people.25
In line with this understanding, psychopathy can
be detected at an early age.
By the age of 10 or 12, most psychopaths exhibit
serious behavioral problems like persistent lying, cheating, theft, fire
setting, truancy, class disruption, substance abuse, vandalism, violence,
bullying, running away, precocious sexuality, cruelty to animals. One
psychopath smiled when he reminisced to Hare about tying puppies to a rail
to use their heads for baseball-batting practice.26
However, the exact causes (and possible steps to
prevent it in infancy and early childhood) are still unknown.
Children predisposed to psychopathy who do not
show obvious signs later in life probably become successful at avoiding
detection because of such factors as increased intelligence and abilities to
better plan and control their behavior.
While the vast majority of research has been
conducted on prison populations, because of the relative ease of research
opportunities, the concept of the successful psychopath (whether that means
he is not criminal or simply doesn't get caught) is a relatively recent
topic of interest for specialists and is not yet clearly defined or publicly
understood, just as the term "psychopath" was in the early twentieth
century.
It is these psychopaths - the ones who avoid detection - who become
successful and ruthless politicians and government insiders, as was the case
with Hermann Göring and Lavrentiy Beria (who will be discussed in future
columns) and is probably the case with contemporary politicians like,
-
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu
-
American ex-Vice President Dick Cheney
-
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi
These men achieve the heights of power, and they
are dangerous.

Snakes in Suits
05 May 2010
Spanish version
The criminal psychopath has been observed and studied for almost a century.
But except for a short mention by Cleckley, the idea of a successful
psychopath - ordinary by almost all external standards - has remained
shrouded in that pervasive "conspiracy of silence". As this series
progresses, it will become clear why this is the case and what exactly are
the ramifications of such a dangerous gap in knowledge and awareness.
So far
the only in-depth presentation of the problem of successful psychopaths has
been Paul Babiak's and Robert Hare's book
Snakes in Suits, published in
2006. The book is essential reading, and has the potential to save your life,
literally.
The information it contains is universal and can be applied to
interactions on any social level.
Babiak, as an industrial and organizational psychologist, encountered his
first corporate psychopath in 1992. By studying operators like "Dave" in the
corporate environment, Babiak not only brought into focus the methods by
which psychopaths infiltrate and ascend the corporate ladder of success, he
shattered previous illusions about what was and wasn't possible for
psychopaths to accomplish.
Many in the industry thought psychopaths wouldn't
be able to succeed in business. They thought that psychopaths' bullying and
narcissistic behaviors would be off-putting to potential hirers, and that
their abuse and manipulations would inevitably lead to failure within the
company. In fact, the so-called "experts" couldn't have been more wrong.
They seemed to have neglected
the
uncanny ability of psychopaths to present
an image of extreme normality, and even excellence, to their victims.
And
that is what we are to them: victims, potential "marks", suckers.
Against the prevailing beliefs and hubristic assumptions, Babiak found that
psychopaths were readily accepted into the management ranks of prominent
companies, and were even experiencing career success.1
Their extreme
narcissism was apparently mistaken as a "positive leadership trait", and the
murky morality and internal chaos typical of the mergers, acquisitions, and
takeover environment seemed perfect for their type. Not only would they do
well under the pressure - not having the ability to feel fear or stress -
the potential personal rewards were too great to refuse, for the business
and the psychopath.
As Babiak put it,
"the lack of specific knowledge about
what constitutes psychopathic manipulation and deceit among businesspeople
was the corporate con's key to success." 2
Ironically, the very traits sought
by corporations and other powerful entities are often the ones that do bring
about their inevitable demise (witness the fall of Bernie Madoff, Enron,
Nazism).
And they are the traits we have been conditioned to see as ideal.
For example, through the "rose-colored glasses" of those who do not know
better,
-
conning and manipulative become "persuasive" and "influential"
-
coldhearted behavior and lack of remorse become "action oriented" and the "ability
to make hard decisions"
-
fearless and impulsive become "courageous" and "high-energy"
-
lack of emotions
becomes "strong" and "controls emotions" 3
In short, when we call a psychopath "persuasive and courageous" we should
actually be charging a commission for doing the psychopath's PR for him,
because that is all it is.
It's like selling bleach and calling it holy
water!
On paper these qualities may look promising, but as coworkers, and
especially as bosses, psychopaths are domineering, intimidating,
frightening, and dangerous. Quick to take credit for others' work and to
hire and fire employees on a whim, they tolerate only praise, are extremely
short-sighted, and genuinely lack the insight that makes a good leader.
One
psychopath, described by Babiak, was,
"unwilling and perhaps unable to
acknowledge that any of her decisions could have any negative consequences
for the business."4
Even when leading superficially "normal" lives,
psychopaths still cause problems in ways that fly under the radar of the law
- economically, psychologically, emotionally.
How do they do it? By analyzing corporate cons, Babiak discovered the basic
methods psychopaths use to operate in a hierarchical, corporate environment.
But no matter in what environment the psychopath finds himself - a romantic
relationship, a corporate strategy, a planned heist, an election campaign, a
political coup... the list of possibilities is endless - he uses the same,
three-phase,
"Assessment - Manipulation - Abandonment" routine on his
victims.
In the first phase, the psychopath assesses the value of his "ally"
and potential patsy - what he or she can do to further the psychopath's
aims. Psychopaths are experts at identifying and pushing others' "buttons",
their,
"likes and dislikes, motives, needs, weak spots, and
vulnerabilities." 5
Others' strengths are utilized and weaknesses exploited.
Next, the psychopath uses messages carefully crafted for the specific
target, utilizing information gathered in the Assessment Phase. He then
adapts his manipulation to accommodate any new feedback from the target in
order to maintain full control.
As Babiak and Hare write:
They often make use of the fact that for many people the content of the
message is less important than the way it is delivered.
A confident,
aggressive delivery style - often larded with jargon, clichés, and flowery
phrases - makes up for the lack of substance and sincerity in their
interactions with others... they are masters of impression management;
their insight into the psyche of others combined with a superficial - but
convincing - verbal fluency allows them to change their personas skillfully
as it suits the situation and their game plan.
They are known for their
ability to don many masks, change "who they are" depending upon the person
with whom they are interacting, and make themselves appear likable to their
intended victim.6
Sounds an awful lot like the work done by intelligence agencies, doesn't it?
When psychopaths rule
Koehli Martin Roessler
Psychopaths also use a variety of manipulation techniques, for example,
gaslighting.
When told a lie often enough, and with seemingly absolute
certainty, normal people tend to doubt their own perceptions.
"Amazingly,
more often than not, victims will eventually come to doubt their own
knowledge of the truth and change their own views to believe what the
psychopath tells them rather than what they know to be true." 7
In this
phase, the psychopath ruthlessly exploits his victims, using them to acquire
money, position, control, and power.
When a person has ceased to be useful,
they are discarded in the final, Abandonment Phase. Loyal to none, this
often has devastating effects on those who were deceived by the psychopath's
façade of lies and "good intentions".
Whether a spouse who has been drained
emotionally, an old woman whose bank account has been emptied, or a "friend"
whose connections have finally paid off, the psychopath inevitably throws
them out and moves on to the next target.
Within the corporate world, Babiak identified a more elaborate five-phase
variation of this dynamic.
First, psychopaths use their charm and gift of
gab to feign leadership qualities, thus gaining entry into the company. Once
hired, they identify possible targets and rivals among coworkers - from
talented but naïve peers whose work can be stolen to secretaries who control
access to important executives - in the assessment phase.
Babiak describes
the four groups of people that psychopaths employ in their games.
Pawns are
ordinary coworkers who have "informal power and influence", and who are
deftly manipulated by psychopaths into wanting - or needing - to support and
please them.
Patrons are high-level individuals with formal power. By
developing rapport with patrons, psychopaths secure protection from the
attacks of lower-level workers who see through the mask. Patsies are pawns
who have lost their usefulness and have thus been discarded. Lastly,
organizational police are individuals like auditors, security, and human
resources staff who are more experienced in detecting manipulation in the
work place.8
In the third, manipulation phase, psychopaths create and maintain their
"psychopathic fiction", setting up positive disinformation about themselves
and negative disinformation about others using the network of pawns, patrons
and "useful idiots" that they create.
By creating conflict among the other
employees, they divert attention away from themselves, preferring to operate
behind the scenes and above the storms that they create and manage. In the
confrontation phase, psychopaths discard rivals and pawns (now patsies),
frequently using techniques of character assassination, framing, and other
tactics using so-called "facts" that deviate significantly from the truth.
They get away with this by relying on the highly placed patrons with whom
they are now cozy. And in the final, ascension phase, they ultimately unseat
their patrons, taking for themselves the positions and prestige of those who
once supported them.9
In the psychopath's game, people exist solely to be
manipulated, and he pursues his aims at any cost, even if that means
backstabbing everyone who supported him in his ascent.
Interest in corporate psychopaths has risen significantly in the last
decade, largely due to the publicity of corporate frauds and scandals like
Enron in 2001 and Madoff in 2009.
Oddly, given the number of political
scandals and their striking similarities to their corporate cousins, the
idea that psychopaths infiltrate governments - with disastrous results - has
yet to receive the attention it deserves. In fact, the political massacres
that are occurring today - the dark aspects of human history that both
fascinate and repel us - and the corruption that inevitably leads to them,
have their roots in the presence of psychopaths in positions of power and
influence.
Psychopaths can be found in prison for all sorts of violent and predatory
crimes against individuals, including white-collar crime.
University
programs, academic societies, conferences, professional textbooks and
manuals, all exist to get a handle on the problem and aid in prevention of
these sorts of crimes. But what about their role in crimes against humanity?
I haven't been able to find one academic paper examining the role of psychopathy in politics, whether in so-called democratic systems or overt
dictatorships.
Just as researchers at first doubted the ability of
psychopaths to succeed in business, and the problem remained unexamined, the
problem of psychopathy in politics remains steadfastly ignored. Political
scientists refuse to look at psychopathy, and psychopathy experts refuse to
look at politics.
The results of such blindness are evident in history - and
the present - for anyone to see.
-
genocides
-
dictatorships
-
state-sanctioned
torture
-
"war without end"
-
political assassinations
-
death squads
-
corruption
-
blackmail
-
spying on civilians
-
"state secrets"
-
illegal
"espionage",
...and on and on.
The situation is odd, considering the fact that experts have made it
increasingly clear that psychopaths can occupy prominent positions in all
professions: law, business, medicine, psychology, academia, military,
entertainment, law enforcement, even - and perhaps especially - politics.
As Babiak and Hare explain it,
"Many [psychopaths] do manage to graduate from
college or obtain professional credentials, but in most cases it is less
through hard work and dedication than through cheating, getting others to do
their work, and generally 'working the system'." 10
Bernard Madoff
The Madoff case offers a great many implications concerning not only the
Wall Street in general, but the political scene as well.
Interestingly, the
list of his victims lacks any US banking names or other serious
institutional investors, who normally require the type of information that Madoff's firm kept off limits. In fact, the business was suspected as a
fraud for nearly a decade, with evidence of misconduct from as far back as
the 70s. And yet serious investigations were held off until his sons turned
him in.
Many knew for years, but remained silent, allowing Madoff to
continue the scheme that would ruin thousands. Conveniently, Madoff's niece
was married to a senior compliance official at the Securities and Exchange
Commission in 2005 and Madoff himself bragged about his close relationships
with SEC regulators.
Madoff's firm had close ties to Washington's lawmakers
and regulators, with Madoff sitting on the board of the Securities Industry
Association, and Madoff's brother sitting on the board of the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).
In Creswell's and
Thomas's
piece for the New York Times, a close associate of Madoff's relates
that,
"He once mentioned to me that he spent one-third of his time in
Washington in the early 1990s, late 1980s."
Not only was Madoff's fund a perfect money laundry for potential
co-conspirators, he was protected by his close ties to the "organizational
police" of the SEC and his domineering control over his employees.
"Nobody
left because they could never get another job that paid as well as this one.
Some people, after his arrest, speculated that it was kind of like hush
money; nobody asked any questions because the Madoffs were nice, protective,
generous."
(The Daily Beast)
According to Babiak and Hare,
"The level and
intensity of psychopathic intimidation often keeps those who have been
abused from coming forward." 11
By controlling underlings and wooing
regulators, Madoff protected himself from exposure. It was only after his
arrogance got the better of him that it all fell apart.
But Madoff is only a symptom of a systemic problem that affects humanity
from the level of interpersonal relationships to heights of political
control. The "garden-variety psychopath" maneuvers for control and power in
a relatively limited sphere of influence: from his immediate family to the
wider group of coworkers and chance victims.
Criminally versatile
psychopaths move from victim to victim, acquiring a tally of,
-
women
emotionally and physically destroyed
-
elderly people bilked of their life
savings
-
charities robbed of their donations
-
children tortured and
mutilated
The corporate psychopath not only affects everyone in the
company's staff; his misdeeds have the potential to ruin the lives of
thousands. But the political psychopath, in a position of the utmost
prestige, power, and influence, has the potential to rule - and ruin -
empires.
His influence reaches level of society and his decisions have the
potential to affect billions.

The Political Psychopath
13 June 2010
Political psychopath, Benjamin Netanyahu
Before their research into corporate psychopathy, Paul Babiak and his
colleagues raised several questions in need of answers.
They are equally relevant to the study of
political psychopathy and can be rephrased as follows:
-
How could a psychopath outshine other
candidates and achieve success in politics?
-
Why would a psychopath want to enter
politics?
-
How long could a psychopath successfully
operate in such an environment?
Jim Kouri, who served on the National Drug Task
Force, has trained police and security officers throughout the United
States, and is currently the fifth vice-president of the National
Association of Chiefs of Police, answers the first question in an editorial
for
examiner.com:
Quite simply, most [psychopathic] serial
killers and many professional politicians must mimic what they believe
are appropriate responses to situations they face such as sadness,
empathy, sympathy, and other human responses to outside stimuli...
If violent offenders are psychopathic, they
are able to assault, rape, and murder without concern for legal, moral,
or social consequences.
This allows them to do what they want,
whenever they want. Ironically, these same traits exist in men and women
who are drawn to high-profile and powerful positions in society
including political officeholders.
Politics is a dog-eat-dog world. Not only must
politicians be relatively thick-skinned to handle attacks on their
character, they must be capable of dishing it out in return.
Psychopaths lie with ease; they do not have any
moral scruples when it comes to character assassination, empty promises,
shameless self-promotion, cutthroat tactics, and using any means to justify
the end. These qualities give them the leading edge over their more honest
(and often naive) competition.
Politics is little different than any other con-job. In a
Ponzi scheme, for
example, the con artist targets members of an identifiable group, whether
religious, racial or age-based. Regardless of whether or not the scammer is
a member of the target group he pretends to represent the group. While
political psychopaths are instrumental in the rise of totalitarian political
groups, they play an equally important role in apparently Democratic
governments.
Their use of a party mask (no pun intended!) is
so common that it can easily be called their primary modus operandi.
But why would a psychopath enter politics in the first place? Simply ask the
question,
"Who is the most powerful person in the world?",
...and many will
answer: 'the President'.
Psychopaths seek positions of power and influence,
and politics offers publicity, prestige, and other perks. It also provides
positions of ultimate authority over military, industry, and entire
populations.
In a world where psychopaths are understandably
viewed as morally repulsive, often finding themselves at home in the
criminal world, politics offers an opportunity to create a new world, to be
free from the ridiculous (in their minds) moral and legal rules of society.
Scanning recent headlines, we regularly see examples of the corruption and
fraud typical of white-collar psychopaths:
In what could turn out to be the greatest
fraud in US history, American authorities have started to investigate
the alleged role of senior military officers in the misuse of $125bn
(£88bn) in a US-directed effort to reconstruct Iraq after the fall of
Saddam Hussein.
The exact sum missing may never be clear,
but a report by the US Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction
(SIGIR) suggests it may exceed $50bn, making it an even bigger theft
than Bernard Madoff's notorious Ponzi scheme.
(Patrick Cockburn, "A
'fraud' bigger than Madoff", The Independent, February 16,
2009)
Defense Department Cannot Account For 25% Of
Funds - $2.3 Trillion
On Sept. 10, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld... said money wasted
by the military poses a serious threat...
"According to some estimates
we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions," Rumsfeld admitted...
Rumsfeld promised change but the next day - Sept. 11 - the world changed
and in the rush to fund the war on terrorism, the war on waste seems to
have been forgotten.
("The
War on Waste", CBS, January 29, 2002)
Israeli police have recommended charging the
country's hard-line foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, with
several counts of corruption as part of a bribery investigation, in a
move that could lead to his resignation and a significant government
reshuffle.
Lieberman, head of a popular far-right
party, is suspected of bribery, fraud, breach of trust, money laundering
and obstruction of justice in a case dating back over nine years. If
charged and convicted on all counts he faces up to 31 years in jail.
(Rory McCarthy, "Israeli
police recommend corruption charges against Avigdor Lieberman",
The Guardian, August 2, 2009)
Rod Blagojevich with President Obama.
In 2008, Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich came under similar media
scrutiny, with several commentators speculating as to his mental health.
Blagojevich was impeached for attempting to
auction off newly elected President Obama's vacant Senate seat. However,
even before his impeachment, the signs were obvious. In his profile of the
governor for February 2008 issue of
Chicago Magazine, David Bernstein portrayed
Blogojevich as narcissistic, arrogant, vindictive, charismatic,
irresponsible, impulsive, untrustworthy, and with presidential aspirations
(how typical!).
After interviewing more than 20 associates of Blagojevich ("from current and
former members of the governor's administration and his campaign staff to
state lawmakers, Democratic benefactors and operatives, academics, pundits,
and political prognosticators"), Bernstein noted that several "resorted to
colorful, four-letter language when describing the governor.
The list of printable insults included "greedy,"
"dumb," "paranoid," and "phony.""
They described dramatic displays of temper over
items as trivial as office stationary, "alleged illegal hiring and political
kickback scandals", his unapologetic lateness for meetings and even
funerals, and a litany of political failures and embarrassments.
As Bernstein puts it, for the man who once
bragged of his "testicular virility" in standing up for himself against the
offender in the stationary incident,
"all the withering criticism, negative
newspaper headlines, and next-to-nothing approval ratings should feel
like a kick to the groin. But if he's fazed, he doesn't show it. In
public, he looks easygoing, unshaken, even self-assured. He still cracks
jokes and smiles that big, toothy grin."
Cool under pressure, Blagojevich obviously saved
his temper for more profitable situations:
"He can't control himself," says Miller.
"I've heard people say that on his own staff."
A Democratic insider
adds,
"Rod sometimes just goes out of his way to have a fight, just
because he can. It's as though he relishes them."
...Last summer, the downstate newspaper the
Peoria Journal Star declared that the governor was "going bonkers."
Privately, a few people who know the governor describe him as a
"sociopath," and they insist they're not using hyperbole. State
representative Joe Lyons, a fellow Democrat from Chicago, told reporters
that Blagojevich was a "madman" and "insane."
"He shows absolutely no remorse," says Jack
Franks, the Democratic state representative. "I don't think he gives a
damn about anybody else's feelings. He tries to demonize people who
disagree with him; he's got delusions of grandeur."
Called a "liar" and likened to a "used-car salesman" by lawmakers after one
incident,
"in an unprecedented move, they demanded
that Blagojevich put any promises on paper in so-called memorandums of
understanding."
In fact, he spent much of his time in office,
"fending off accusations of ethical irregularities within his
administration."
But despite the rumors, innuendos, and outright
accusations,
"Blagojevich has claimed - sometimes
indignantly - that he has done nothing wrong." He blames the scandals on
"a few bad apples who violated the rules" and who deceived him."
In short, Blagojevich shows all the hallmarks of
a political psychopath, albeit a fairly obvious one.
And he surely isn't the only one. Just as the
'best' psychopaths are those who evade detection, living lifetimes of
successful crime, the best political psychopaths operate in such a manner as
to hold on as long as possible.
Robert Hare, in his 1970 book
Psychopath: Theory and Research, as
well as James Blair, Derek Mitchell, and Karina Blair in their 2005 book
The Psychopath: Emotion and the Brain,
observe that negative environmental conditions such as low socioeconomic
status, abuse, and poor parenting, along with low IQ, are often associated
with high psychopathy scores, particularly among those who engage in
persistent, violent criminal behavior.
These psychopathic offenders are often
considered the worst of the worst in courts and prisons. However, these
factors seem only to affect the expression of psychopathy.
As Dr. Hare says in filmmaker Ian Walker's
excellent documentary, I, Psychopath, on the diagnosed psychopath and
self-styled narcissism guru, Sam Vaknin, while psychopaths often tell of
some traumatic childhood that made them the way they are, psychopaths come
from all backgrounds, good or bad.
Speaking of successful psychopaths like Vaknin,
he says,
"If you're very bright, know how to dress
well; you have, say, the gift of the gab; you're raised in an affluent
family background; [then] you don't go in the bank and rob it, you get
in the bank and become a director..."
In fact, Vaknin makes a perfect case study for
the type of psychopath that is most dangerous to political institutions, and
thus entire nations.
Best known as an Internet guru for "malignant
self-love", Vaknin was arrested in Israel in 1995 for major securities
fraud.
The documentary follows Walker, Vaknin, and Lidija (Vaknin's wife) as
they visit several European institutions to test if Vaknin is indeed a
psychopath.
Vaknin ends up scoring 18 (out of 24) on the
PCL-SV (Screening Version), developed by Dr. Hare, a score higher than the
majority of offenders in US correctional facilities, and the cutoff point
for psychopathy.
Diagnosed psychopath, Sam Vaknin.
However, according Walker, Vaknin, like many of
the so-called successful psychopaths now being studied by Hare, Bakiak, and
others, is not an "archetypal, textbook" psychopath.
Contrary to the criminal populations, Vaknin is
never physically violent. He has also been married to the same woman for ten
years, while most psychopaths are seemingly incapable of such 'commitment',
engaging in a string of short-term relationships. (His emotional treatment
of her is another matter, however.)
Most interestingly, he is remarkably self-aware,
and his insights agree with what the experts have to say.
For example, in total seriousness, Vaknin had
the following exchange with Walker:
Vaknin: "I like to present a facade of the
self-effacing, modest person. It gives people the impression that,
underneath it all, I'm human."
Walker: "But you are human, aren't you?"
Vaknin: "I firmly believe that you want to believe that, yes... [The
psychopath] regards people as instruments of gratification and as
disposable things to be used... The vast majority of psychopaths, like
an iceberg, are underwater, and like an iceberg, they are inert. They do
nothing. They're just there. They torment their spouse by being
unempathic, but they don't beat her or kill her. They bully coworkers,
but they don't burn the office. They are not dramatic. They are
pernicious. Most psychopaths are subtle. They are more like poison than
a knife, and they are more like slow-working poison than cyanide."
After subjecting Walker to a series of degrading
insults (a regular occurrence during filming), and with Walker still visibly
in shock, Vaknin coolly, and with disturbingly sadistic insight, described
the process to him:
"Your body was flooded instantly with
adrenalin and its relatives like norepinephrine... Now when these
moments pervade the bloodstream, your brain reacts. It shuts down
certain centers and activates others. This is called the stress
reaction, or stress syndrome, actually. Then when the abuse recedes, the
adrenalin levels begin to drop.
As they drop, the entire system goes into
mayhem. So what bullies usually do, they start and stop, start and stop.
That achieves the maximal stress syndrome, and this is the great secret
of bullying. Never overdo it. Small doses. The victim will do the rest.
Although you are shaking much less [now] ... I must do something about
that."
This type of self-aware psychopath is perhaps
the most dangerous to humanity.
When his instinctive drive for domination of
others is coupled with the means to attain to positions of power, he is not
only free of the restraints of conscience by nature, but finds himself
largely above (or indeed the architect) of the laws that are meant to
protect normal human beings from the the deviant impulses so clearly defined
by the psychopathic mind.
As a president, politician, military or
corporate chief, a vast number of people are literally at his mercy.

The Truth Behind the War on Terror
27 July 2010
Fearful children - fearful
adults
Grist for the psychopath's
mill.
Human relationships are plagued by fear. This cycle all too often begins in
our first relationship with our parents.
Too self-absorbed to recognize what their child
truly requires of them, many parents betray their own child's weakness and
dependency on his caregivers - his emotional need for comfort, security,
trust, and the loving acceptance of those closest to him.
Having missed out on these important periods of
growth, this boy, now a parent himself, may come to feel threatened by the
emotional needs of his own child, becoming dependent on his own children and
spouse to provide what he never had. The vicious cycle spirals on, and in
turn, his own children learn to stifle their needs, deny their own feelings,
and live as hollow reflections of the needs of their father.
When a child must meet the emotional needs of a
parent, and not the other way around, the parent-child relationship is
inverted.
Stephanie Donaldson-Pressman and
Robert Pressman call this the 'narcissistic
family dynamic', and the problems it causes are directly relevant
to the vast geopolitical problems the world currently faces.
Such children, like their parents, seek some source of comfort, some sense
of security, but not knowing where to look and what to look out for, they
often find it in all the wrong places: their own children, their lovers,
their work, some religious or political cause.
As much as they may deny it, they are motivated
by the very fears they experienced as children - afraid of being alone, not
belonging, uncertain, unloved, confused, abandoned. They find shelter from
the pain in some literal or symbolic arms of embrace, yet it is incomplete
in some way, like the 'security' of a sinking ship or of a castle built on
foundations of sand.
Not wanting to let go, and face that pain again,
they shore up their defenses - a rallying of troops to give 'the people',
their own fragmented personalities, a sense of security. But such a cover-up
is built upon and dependent on lies, things half-seen through the lens of
denied and distorted emotion.
We may be denying that we are in a relationship
with a psychopath, someone who, despite the abuse and mental torture they
subject us to, offers us some sense of comfort and stability in life. Or we
may deny our own betrayal of our loved ones' emotional needs: the child we
criticize and deform according to our own twisted ideals or the lover we
demand to be someone they are not.
I find it fascinating how these dynamics of a single human soul mirror so
well the delusions of the many.
Just as we rally our mental forces to hold onto
that equilibrium we desperately fear losing, we rally our military forces to
protect us from enemies that do not exist, covering up problems at home that
dwarf those projected 'out there'. How does this come to be?
So far in this series, I've
described
psychopaths - individuals devoid of conscience, incapable of
remorse, and hungry for power - and their infiltration of
corporations and
politics
- two seats of power in the modern era.
Manipulating mass emotion, particularly fear, is their modus operandi. It's
commonly said that politicians exploit fear, but what is missing from this
truism is an understanding of exactly what motivates them to do so, why
they're so good at it, and the extent to which they go about doing so.
Psychopaths understand human behavior, often better than we understand
ourselves.
In the last article I quoted a diagnosed
psychopath, Sam Vaknin,
describing how he used emotional abuse and insults to break down
his victims.
It was just one example of the special
psychological knowledge possessed by psychopaths, refined after a lifetime
of observing and interacting with 'others' whose foreign emotional reactions
strike them as so comical and ridiculous. When this special knowledge is
translated onto the global stage, you get geopolitics and all the propaganda
and lies that accompany it.
Yes, psychopaths crave power and will do anything they can to hold on to it,
but even that does not get to the heart of the matter. If a psychopath is
not born into a position of influence and power, where he has license to do
whatever he feels compelled to do without recourse, he feels like a slave in
a system he cannot quite understand. He is hindered by incomprehensible
laws, arbitrary social customs and interpersonal rules that make no sense to
him. He is not free to be himself.
To a psychopath, true freedom is simply license
to use, abuse, and torture other people - physically, emotionally and
financially. Any hindrance on that bloated sense of entitlement is a
nuisance he dreams of removing by instituting a social system of his own
creation.
This is the true definition of
'totalitarianism', 'fascism', or a 'new world order' - a system of
government where the psychopath is not arrested for beating his wife,
killing his enemies, making emotional wrecks of his family and close
acquaintances, stalking those who know his true nature and threaten to
reveal it to more of those 'others' who so persecute him. In our world, the
'war on terror' is the means to this end.
New terms like 'homegrown radicalization' and
'extraordinary rendition' are created, while familiar terms are appropriated
and special meanings for those 'in the know' are instilled alongside the
ordinary meanings understood by the common people.
In an interview in 1989 entitled "Recollections
of 23 Years of Service to the US", Pentagon insider Col.
Fletcher Prouty described how the days of traditional warfare were over.
The new wars would be economic, and the new enemy would be terrorism. This
is exactly what has happened (see Naomi Klein's
The
Shock Doctrine).
But, as many have come to know, there is much
more to the 'War on Terror' than meets the eye.
The long history of
COINTELPRO-type operations in the US, whereby groups deemed to be
potential 'dissidents' are infiltrated and co-opted in a direction favorable
to the National Security State, along with
ECHELON
surveillance of anyone deemed a potential 'threat' by the
political psychopaths in power, makes it absolutely certain that any
potential 'terrorist' group in the US has long since been identified,
observed, and infiltrated by US intelligence and law enforcement. In fact,
this has been the case the world over.
In the aftermath of WWII, and with the advent of a new 'Cold War', various
stay-behind operations were formed in the countries of Europe (see Daniele
Ganser's
NATO's Secret Armies).
These groups formed the basis of national
resistance movements against the threat of Communist takeover.
Unbeknownst to many involved, they were
sponsored largely by NATO and the CIA. When it became clear that the threat
of Communist invasion was minimal (these movements were active in such
countries as Italy, France, Belgium, and West Germany), the focus shifted
from external threats to potential internal threats - local Communists and
the 'threat' they posed to the then-current power structures.
The CIA funded and supported various extremist
right-wing groups in this cause. Neo-Nazi groups and other extremist groups
were infiltrated and controlled by the CIA and the secret services of the
various European countries.
What was the result? A
series of terror attacks struck the civilian
populations of these countries.
Left-wing groups and individuals were blamed by
the governments, who then entrenched their power with the support of
terrified populations when they turned to them for 'support' and 'security'.
However, the attacks were actually carried out by the very groups that had
been infiltrated and controlled by the governments - groups who were then
protected by these governments, like in the Milan bombing of 1969 which
killed sixteen, or the Tuscany railroad bombings in the early '70s.
Similarly, as former BBC Middle East
correspondent Alan Hart observes (see his
Zionism - The Real Enemy of the
Jews), Israel and its intelligence service, Mossad, has long-since
infiltrated every Arab government and 'terrorist' organization.
In fact, Mossad had agents tailing several of the alleged 9/11 hijackers in the
months prior to the attacks (see Justin Raimondo's
The Terror Enigma).
Not to mention the fact that Osama Bin Laden had
been a
CIA asset until the day before 9/11, as had many of his fellow Mujaheddin in their fight against the Soviets.
When you put these facts together, they paint a striking picture. Western
intelligence agencies have long had inside access to various 'terrorist'
groups and used them in a self-described 'strategy of tension'. And yet the
US and its allies are currently fighting an endless war against these
nebulous groups that are in fact CIA assets.
Why? As Hermann Goering said to his captors at
Nuremberg,
"It is always a simple matter to drag the
people along [to war]... Voice or no voice, the people can always be
brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do
is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for
lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same
in any country."
More truthfully, attack them, tell them they
have been attacked by 'communists' or 'terrorists', then denounce the
'liberals', 'bleeding hearts', and 'peace-lovers' as 'terrorist
sympathizers'.
If we look closely at any 'terrorist attack' in the last 10 years - even the
foiled attempts - we see a long list of connected
intelligence assets,
FBI
agents acting as 'Al Qaeda recruiters',
informants, and
patsies manipulated
for the cause.
In recent years,
Russia,
Britain,
Israel, and
the United States have all been caught red-handed attempting such
deceptions. Put simply, political psychopaths are in control of the
governments of our world. Goaded on by a disdain for human morality, a drive
for power and influence, and a desire to create a world where they are the
ones calling the shots, they have created an enemy to strike fear into the
hearts of humanity and to exploit the fear that is already present.
Terrorism does not exist; at least not in the way governments and the media
present it.
Terrorist groups have long been infiltrated,
created, or otherwise controlled by these political psychopaths. In essence,
these men and women have murdered their own civilians and blamed a
fictitious enemy in order to gain popular support for a cause that will
never be won.
The 'War
on Terror' is an endless one, because these people do not and
cannot see an end to their power. And while we denounce the 'evil
terrorists' and the 'homegrown radicalization' of our own citizens, the
political psychopaths merely see us as suckers, mindless actors in a play of
their own creation.
They are like the con man who says,
"Well if they were so stupid as to believe
me, they deserved it!"
If anything is to change, and if we are ever to
end this ridiculous 'war' against an abstract noun, two things are needed.
-
First, we need to take steps towards removing
political psychopaths from office, making it impossible for psychopaths to
achieve any position of political, corporate, or economic power. Giving psychopaths power and influence and
expecting them to be adequate leaders is like expecting a blind man to drive
a bus. Psychopaths are color blind when it comes to issues having to do with
the well being of humanity.
-
Second, we must come to grips with our true
history, and what is really behind the spin of the current 'war on terror'.
We are arresting, torturing, and murdering innocent people along with
patsies whose controllers get away with everything because they operate
behind the scenes.
Without ponerology, things will only get worse.

Psychopathy at Nuremburg
06 September 2010
USHMM Photo Archives
View of the defendants in the
dock at
the International Military Tribunal trial of war criminals at
Nuremberg.
If, as many people are saying nowadays, psychopaths are the ones running our
governments,
-
How come we don't know about it?
-
Why isn't it common knowledge, discussed
in households and classrooms across the land?
-
Why isn't academia devoting courses to
it?
-
In short, why is such a simple, yet
revolutionary idea so seemingly secret?
The answer may actually be in the question: it
is revolutionary, but not in the sense you're thinking!
You see, most revolutions are either caused,
influenced, or hijacked by psychopaths and quite often this is done by what
is called "abuse of psychiatry."
A normal person's actions and reactions, his ideas and moral criteria, all
strike the abnormal individual as abnormal. If a person with a personality
disorder such as psychopathy considers himself and others like him normal -
which is of course significantly easier if he and his friends are in power -
then he would consider a normal person different and therefore abnormal.
That explains why, when psychopaths rise to power, as they naturally tend to
do, their social systems - including education and medicine/psychiatry -
always have the tendency to treat any dissidents - or potential dissidents -
as "mentally abnormal".
As Lobaczewski wrote,
"A normal person strikes a psychopath as a
naive, smart-alecky believer in barely comprehensible theories; calling
him "crazy" is not all that far away."
Thus, such governments generally control
psychology and psychiatry via control of funding and ideationally alert
"thought police" in academia, and the myriad ways in which normal people
unconsciously respond to a pathological environment begin to be defined as
illnesses and "psychiatric solutions", including drugs, are promoted to
force normal people to live in a pathological world and think it is normal.
The truth about psychopathy must be degraded and marginalized to prevent it
from jeopardizing the system itself, and this very practice is then used as
an expedient tool in the hands of the pathological authorities.
Anyone who is too knowledgeable about
psychopathy will be accused of anything that can be trumped up, including
psychological abnormality. They're "crazy", "paranoid", "mentally unstable",
and "dangerous".
This, then, is at the root of the differences between those in power and the
masses of people who are oppressed by them and who, ultimately and always,
rise up against them. The pressures of living in a pathological world can be
borne only so long and eventually, drugs, bread and circuses no longer
suffice to suppress the masses of normal people.
At the same time, still other psychopaths - not
yet at the top - rely on the violent emotions of fanatic revolutionaries and
oppressed peoples, goading them on and riding the waves of popular
discontent into the halls of power, crushing their "enemies" in the process.
It's always useful to get rid of a lot of normal people. traumatize everyone
else, and keep people thinking that now they have revolted against the
oppressors and all will be well again!
So, you see, the idea is revolutionary because if it's ever widely known
that it is really a matter of pathologicals vs. normal humans rather than the
various ideologies in which pathology hides and takes over, the psychopaths
will be powerless.
Lacking the ability to corral people into wars
against exaggerated (and often illusory) enemies, the psychopaths' network
of support would crumble, and the emperors would be left naked in the
streets, for all to see.
As I've already discussed in previous articles in this series, psychopaths
have a particular way of seeing the world. They know they're different and
they easily recognize others like themselves even in a crowd. They're the
enlightened, we're the rabble; they're the worthy, we're the useless eaters;
they're the wolves, we're the sheep.
And they know that, if those contemptible others
- that is, all the rest of us - were to see them for what they are, they'd
be locked up, or worse. That "injustice" - living in a world that would
limit their "freedom" to prey on others - is what goads them on to create a
nightmare world for the rest of us, with all the injustice of Orwell's
vision and all the dead-end absurdity of Kafka's allegories. And once they
have power, they intend to keep it.
Objective science is thus a dangerous thing to
political psychopaths and must be silenced at all costs.
On the flip side of the coin, political psychopaths benefit from the efforts
of well-meaning individuals unaware of the psychological factors at play,
who are nevertheless invested in their own theories as to the causes of the
problems they see plaguing the world. So, ironically, these are the ideas
they promote. "Know your enemy", but also fund him and make him think he's
got the whole banana.
With a basis of objective ideas about pathology,
it's fairly easy to spot these theories. They're the ones that focus
exclusively on a particular ideology (i.e. "it's capitalism!", "it's
socialism!", "it's fundamentalist Christianity!", "it's Islamo-fascism!"),
or are based on assumptions downplaying the role of psychopathology in the
very real problems of evil in the world.
I've written about some of the problems in the field of psychology,
specifically in the study of psychopathy, elsewhere. Setting aside the
problems of diagnosis that the catch-all "antisocial personality disorder"
presents, there's the simple issue of specialization.
Researchers of psychopathy for the most part
deal with issues they can study up close: brains, criminals, simple
behaviors. They stay out of politics, because it's both difficult to study,
and not favorable to the pocketbook. Politics is for political scientists
and historians. As for the political psychologists, most of them are unaware
of the problems of psychopathy because of the nature of specialization (and
a multitude of bogus theories) within psychology itself.
It could be said that specialization itself is
one of the greatest gifts to psychopaths the world over. There's little
chance of scientists pooling their knowledge and forming a united front
posing any danger to the status quo when no one knows what the other is
saying!
But there was a time when political psychopaths -
pathocrats, to be more
precise, because in a pathological system more than one type of pathology
participates in the network of control - could be studied up close and
personal, and they were.
However, the pathocrats running the prison, who
made this opportunity a reality, quickly squashed any future possibility of
gaining the much-needed data that could be gleaned from their captives. I am
referring to that time right after the Allies won World War II, and a
representative selection of Hitler's top officials were held to be tried for
war crimes and crimes against humanity at the International Military
Tribunal in Nuremburg.
The most wicked of the accused were executed in short order. While many saw
this as justice, future generations were robbed of what could have been a
treasure trove of knowledge about the true nature of Nazism and its leading
figures.
Luckily, while the defendants were still living,
a few American psychologists were able to glean what they could, and one of
them - Nuremberg prison psychologist Gustav M. Gilbert - even wrote a
book, The Psychology of Dictatorship which could have been the foundation of
a new science.
But that is not what happened. Not only were the most interesting of the
criminals summarily executed, the book about them was never reprinted and
only the most dubious of its data (the Rorschach protocols Gilbert
conducted) has been looked at and talked about since.
It's hardly coincidental that the bulk of his conclusions were ignored and
only the weakest parts promoted (in Miale & Selzer's The Nuremburg Mind, for
example). It's classic perception management.
Those reading references to Gilbert's work,
which reach valid conclusions though using dubious proofs (the Rorschach
test is all but completely discredited in today's fields of experimental
psychology and psychiatry, especially when it comes to psychopathy), will
unfairly conclude that there is little value in his work. Ironically,
Gilbert hardly mentions his Rorshach tests in the book, and yet this is
where ALL attention has been focused when anyone talks or writes about the
psychology of the Nuremberg war criminals.
So, what did Gilbert really say?
His book was published in 1950, nine years after Hervey Cleckley's The Mask
of Sanity first hit the shelves in 1941. At the time, it was common among
historians and other academics to downplay the role of individuals in the
shaping of history.
As one textbook of the time stated:
"With some striking exceptions, the
individual counts for little in the social scheme of things... [A
leader's] success will depend mainly on his happening to lead them
[social circumstances] in the direction in which they happen to be
going."1
As if social circumstances were some nebulous
force completely divorced of human motivations!
Unfortunately, this is still
the prevailing view among historians. Today it's called "structuralism" -
Hitler wasn't the problem per se, the whole Nazi structure was.
This is certainly partially correct, but thanks to a convenient twist in the
theory, it poses no problems to psychopaths (which is probably why it's so
popular these days). If the role of the individual is downplayed, it's all
in the structural, economic, social forces, you see!
(Never mind that psychopaths and other
pathologicals have inter-penetrated the social structure with a ramified
network of mutual pathological conspiracies and are busily causing those
very problems!)
But with these assumptions guiding the
historian's hand, any relevant characteristics of the individuals comprising
that structure, and giving it force and meaning, are equally dismissed
offhand. Thus, any patterns to be noticed in the nodal points of key
positions of power fade into the background.
By downplaying the features of the single
individual (e.g. Hitler), the theory is willfully blind to the results
caused by a network of similar-minded (but not normal) individuals (i.e. the
psychopaths within the whole Nazi network: the SS, lawyers, bankers,
businessmen, military men, etc.).
If only there weren't those darned anomalies!
According to the theory, Hitler was an anomaly of the system. A man whose
interests just happened to correspond to the nature of the "structural"
forces at play.
But despite their popularity, these theories
cannot account for the strikingly foreign nature of the times they seek to
study and explain. In the minds of many, Hitler's Germany was one of those
"exceptions". The brutal and anti-human nature of the Nazi regime - the "new
reality" to which the Germans and their victims were subjected - became
clear to the world over the course of the war, and it horrified humanity.
As Field Marshal and Nuremberg defendant Wilhelm
Keitel related to Gilbert,
"He [Hitler] stood for a complete reversal
of [the Wermacht's] values: brutality and injustice became virtues of
'hardness'; decency and honor became contemptible weakness."2
When Gilbert asked Rudolf Höss, commandant at
Auschwitz, if he had ever considered whether his millions of victims
deserved their fate,
"he tried patiently to explain that there
was something unrealistic about such questions, because he had been
living in an entirely different world." 3
In this world, the leaders possessed the
qualities of,
"uncompromising hardness and brutality,
nationalism with a paranoid tinge, in-group loyalty and out-group
hostility. Deceit, treachery, persecution, and murder could be condoned
in this militant, ethnocentric frame of reference, and the leader was
the one who excelled in these virtues." 4
As Gilbert later wrote, the post-war trials led
to,
"widespread speculation concerning the
sanity or lack of it on the part of the whole Nazi leadership".5
This speculation on the part of the public was
simple common sense, because one can't hope to understand a system like
Nazism without a good understanding of individual AND social psychology.
The Germans were experiencing the full force and
iron grip of a macrosocial psychopathic reality.
Predictably, academic opinions quickly polarized between two, extreme and
equally untenable conclusions. Either the Nazis (as a whole, mind you) were
totally psychotic (think Norman Bates' character in Psycho) or normal people
"just following orders". This cognitive error (also taken straight out of
the psychopath's handbook) is still prevalent today.
And as usual, the truth is not quite so simple;
the competing options are not mutually exclusive. As historian of ideas José
Brunner notes, "one can notice a surprisingly broad area of underlying
agreement" between the opposing opinions of Nazi leaders as "sane or
psychopaths".6
In Gilbert's work (and later, Lobaczewski's), an
understanding of psychopathy, psychopathology in general, and normal social
influences helped place the discussion in a more realistic and empirical
middle ground.
"Anomalies" like Nazism involve a complex
network of psychopathic individuals who inspire the system as a whole,
individuals with various other mental pathologies, and normal people who get
caught up under their collective spellbinding influence.
While leaders can and do play a crucial role in
history, Gilbert writes:
...that does not imply by any means that
leaders create history single-handedly... socioeconomic, political, and
historical forces ... do not exist as pure abstractions, but become
manifest only through the behavior of human beings... [the] interplay of
personalities and social processes... cultural mores help to determine
the nature of political leadership, and the latter in turn influences
the development of the cultural pattern.7

The defendants listen as the prosecution begins introducing documents
at the
International Military Tribunal trial of war criminals at Nuremberg.
As a German-speaking officer and psychologist responsible for interrogating
prisoners of war, Gilbert was given unprecedented and unlimited access to
the defendants; as he put it,
"a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to prove
the fascist mind".8
Facing trial were top-position Nazis such as,
-
Hitler's deputy, Rudolf Hess
-
Nazi philosopher Alfred Rosenberg
-
Reichsminister for armaments and
munitions, Albert Speer
-
SS-Colonel and commander of Auschwitz
Rudolf Höss
-
Reichsfeldmarschall, head of the
Luftwaffe, and president of the Reichstag, Hermann Göring
The Nazi war criminals held in Nuremburg
provided the first opportunity for psychologists and psychiatrists to study
key members of a corrupt and criminal political regime. Unfortunately, as
we've already seen, it was a short-lived opportunity.
So what were Gilbert's conclusions, and what was so dangerous about them
that they had to be marginalized, destroyed and misrepresented? Before I
quote some of the most important ones, it helps to see what others were
saying about the Nazis at the time.
Prior to Gilbert's arrival, chief of psychiatry for the European Theatre of
Operations Douglas M. Kelley had access to the prisoners for a brief period
of five months and wrote of his experiences and conclusions in his book 22
Cells in Nuremberg, published in 1947.
Like Hannah Arendt, who later covered the trial
of Adolph Eichmann in Israel and coined the term "the banality of evil" to
describe Eichmann's seeming normality, nonchalance and apathy, Kelley saw
the Nazis as basically ordinary people caught up in the machinery of
military orders and bureaucracy. Unable to find any signs of obvious
pathology in the defendants, he labeled them "sane" and deemed Nazism a
strictly "socio-cultural disease".9
The psychopaths, occupying that nebulous middle
ground between sanity and madness, thus flew under the radar of Kelley's
inquiring eye. In short, Kelley was duped by a collective mask of sanity,
the mendacity of which he could not fathom.
While Kelley missed the diagnosis of psychopathy (in his view, common now,
everyone is just a different degree of "normal"), he did make some prescient
observations:
Strong, dominant, aggressive, egocentric personalities like Göring,
differing from the normal chiefly in their lack of conscience, are not rare.
They can be found anywhere in the country [i.e. the United States] - behind
big desks deciding big affairs as businessmen, politicians, racketeers.10
Significantly, he also wrote that such personalities,
"could be duplicated in any country of the
world today" and that "there are undoubtedly certain individuals who
would willingly climb over the corpses of one half of the people of the
United States, if by so doing, they could thereby be given control over
the other half".11
Today, we're seeing just how true this statement
is.
Gilbert was more descriptive:
... by inculcating fear and hostility toward
enemy groups and by encouraging the persecution of scapegoats it helps
to constrict human empathy and ultimately "desensitizes" an increasing
number of individuals to extreme aggression.
This constriction of affect, combined with
the militaristic "categorical imperative" and the ideological
restriction of reality-testing, produces organized irrational hostility
which is not only unlimited in its destructive potential but
precipitates a self-destructive reaction... the tendency of such a
system is clear: the crippling of human [conscience] and
reality-testing, which allow the irrational and psychopathic to become
the norm, and the normal individual to become an unthinking member of a
society regimented for irrational aggression. 12
Interestingly, Kelley established a strong
rapport with Göring, the creator of the Gestapo and concentration camps,
taken by his intelligence, charm, "courage", and image as a family man, in
other words, some of the very qualities mistaken by many corporate employers
as good "leadership qualities".
Kelley even committed suicide in 1958 using the
same method Göring used the day before his scheduled execution - by
swallowing a cyanide capsule.13
Cleckley once remarked that his secretaries
could always tell which of his patients were psychopaths - they were the
only ones who could convince him to lend them money - and it seems that
Kelley, too, fell under the sway of a smooth manipulator. This is not to
suggest that either Cleckley or Kelley were not insightful enough, but
rather sharply emphasizes the abilities of a "good" psychopath!
Gilbert, on the other hand, called a spade a spade. He diagnosed Göring as
an "amiable" and "narcissistic" psychopath.14
In his many conversations with Göring, Gilbert
was able to make several insightful and often entertaining - although
equally disturbing - observations about him, which are recounted in his
book.
Because the book is rare, I have compiled some
of the most telling anecdotes and direct quotes illustrating Göring's
psychopathy.

Herman Göring.
Portrait of a Political Psychopath
Göring presented himself as impulsive,
egocentric, aggressive, sensation seeking, unable to tolerate frustration,
superficially charming, glib, remorseless, and callous - all the hallmarks
of psychopathy.
He showed insensitivity to danger, admitting,
"he just never believed that any harm could
really befall him"; and sadistic aggression for which "[his] father's
punishments proved to be of no avail."
His mother allegedly stated,
"Hermann will either be a great man or a
great criminal!"
Göring's first memory, related to Gilbert, was
that of,
"bashing his mother in the face with both
fists when she came to embrace him after a prolonged absence, at the age
of three."
As a child playing soldiers with his peers, he
would similarly bash the heads of anyone questioning his leadership to "let
them know damn quick who was boss." 15
As Gilbert described, Göring had,
"a ruthlessly aggressive personality", "an
emotional insensitivity and perverted humor which were at once the seeds
of outward physical boldness and of moral depravity".16
However, he "presented a front of utter
amiability and good-humored bravado", i.e. a charming "mask of sanity" which
he used whenever it suited his purpose.
He received a very high IQ score of 138 and,
"Being led to believe that he had the
highest I.Q. among the Nazi war criminals [at Nuremberg] he praised the
excellent discrimination of American psychometric methods. When he
[later] heard that Schacht and Seyss-Inquart had outdone him on the I.Q.
exam, he scorned the unreliability of the test."
However, Gilbert observed that his intelligence
was more characterized by,
"superficial and pedestrian realism, rather
than brilliantly creative intelligence." 17
As a young man, he naturally joined the
military, as it provided an outlet for his aggression, tendency to
domination, and showmanship.
Aware of the nature of the military hierarchy,
he was rigidly subservient to his superiors, knowing that,
"he would some day be able to demand the
same from his inferiors."
Just like a modern corporate psychopath, Göring
identified those with whom he needed to ingratiate himself (e.g.
officer-instructors at the academy) and those he could get away with
treating disdainfully (e.g. civilian teachers).
"Göring explained quite simply... that the
officers could punish you, while the civilians could only threaten you
or, what was even sillier, appeal to your moral sense."
The model of a corrupt politician, Göring took
bribes for tax-exemption and successfully managed his "business interests"
(e.g. arms dealing).
Gilbert observed,
"during World War I Göring made the
dangerous and fateful discovery that war could bring both glory and
profit to one who was sufficiently reckless, unscrupulous and amiable."
As Göring himself said to Gilbert,
"The idea of democracy was absolutely
repulsive to me... I joined the party precisely because it was
revolutionary, not because of the ideological stuff. Other parties had
made revolutions, so I figured I could get in on one too!" 18
In short, Göring exploited the ideology and
structure of Nazism for his own personal ambition, greed, and sadistic need
for power.
And yet, he still gave seemingly blind support
to Hitler. Why? This is a question that puzzles many psychopathy researchers
and even causes them to doubt the possibility that psychopaths could ever
maintain a stable position in any political or corporate system.
After all,
psychopaths are notoriously self-serving and impulsive.
They are loyal to no one and quick to turn on
their so-called "associates" and "friends". But for intelligent psychopaths
like Göring, subservience to superiors is not loyalty per se. It is mere lip
service that allows them to reap the benefits of their environment.
Think of
Karl Rove and
George Bush - Rove played his part of cunning underling
because that's where he gained the most benefits.
Just as psychopaths will often abide by prison
rules to secure parole or lighter sentences, even feigning religious
conversion, they will work within a political structure like Nazism because
they have an interest in doing so. Whereas in a normal society psychopaths
are persecuted by non-psychopaths because of their antisocial attitudes and
behaviors, in a system like the Nazi dictatorship, the rules change. In a
society with no higher authority than themselves, they have an interest in
maintaining it, even if that means sucking up to a delusional fanatic.
However, while alliances are created and maintained in such a system, there
is another motivation at work.
Self-promotion and the resulting backstabbing is
just as much a part of the game. And Göring was an expert. At Nuremburg, he
repeatedly showed a typical ease of yarn spinning and shirking of
responsibility to others, demonstrating the real nature of his so-called
"loyalties".
He was caught in several obvious contradictions
and lies during his testimony and was quick to denounce his fellow Nazis,
shouting frequent outbursts such as the following:
"Roehm! Don't talk to me about that dirty
homosexual swine! That was the real clique of perverted bloody
revolutionists! They are the ones who made the Party look like a pack of
hoodlums, with their wild orgies and beating up Jews on the street and
smashing windows!... What a gang of perverted bandits that SA was! It is
a damn good thing I wiped them out or they would have wiped us out!"
As Gilbert points out, however,
"These were, of course, the very same
hoodlums whom Göring had trained in street-fighting".19
Sounds a bit like the American pundits who
lambaste the very "Islamic terrorists" they funded and trained in the '70s
and '80s, doesn't it?
Alliances are only alliances when they're
convenient. As soon as they're not, all bets are off. Gilbert was able to
observe Göring's manipulative "divide and conquer" modus operandi in
operation:
It was interesting to compare notes with
some of the other officers who were seeing him at this time, to see how
he was maligning the psychologist to the psychiatrist, and vice versa,
both chaplains to the psychologist and psychiatrist, and vice versa,
while fawning on each in turn. In the prisoners' dock, which was the
only place he could meet the others now, he repeated the same process
with militarists against civilians, Prussians against Bavarians,
Protestants against Catholics, and always vice versa, smiling to each in
turn, but soliciting sympathy by scorning him behind his back to members
of opposed groups...
Finally, when Speer made his spectacular
denunciation of Hitler and Göring, Göring reacted in typical gangster
fashion, threatening to have Speer murdered if he ever got out of the
jail alive.20
After seeing film evidence of the atrocities of
the regime, many of the defendants broke down crying in shame, but Göring
had a different reaction.
"It was such a good afternoon too, until
they showed that film. They were reading my telephone conversations on
the Austrian affair, and everybody was laughing with me. And then they
showed that awful film, and it just spoiled everything." 21
On April 18, 1946, Göring offered his infamous
glimpse behind the psychopathic mask of fascism to Gilbert, quoted in the
last installment of this series. ("All you have to do is tell them they are
being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and
exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.")
And on an another occasion, he said:
"What do you mean, morality...
word-of-honor?" Göring snorted.
"Sure, you can talk about word-of-honor when
you promise to deliver goods in business. - But when it is the question
of the interests of the nation!? - Phooey! Then morality stops. That is
what England has done for centuries; America has done it; and Russia is
still doing it!...
When a state has a chance to improve its
position because of the weakness of a neighbor, do you think it will
stop at any squeamish consideration of keeping a promise? It is a
statesman's duty to take advantage of such a situation for the good of
his country!" 22
Göring wholly embraced the psychopathic
"dog-eat-dog" worldview.
For him, as for the psychopaths dictating "war
on terror"-inspired foreign policy today,
"preventive war, aggressive war, politics,
and peace were all just different aspects of the same struggle for
supremacy which was in the very nature of things, with the rewards going
to the strongest nation and the cleverest leaders."23
This is the stark reality behind the political
propaganda of "national interests" dished out for public consumption in the
world.
Gilbert's most dangerous conclusion was equally
blunt:
"Psychopathic personalities undoubtedly play
an important part in major manifestations of social pathology,
particularly when they achieve positions of leadership in social groups
and movements. It is all too clear that they played a decisive role in
the revolutionary nucleus of the Nazi movement, and thus determined the
complexion of the government of Nazi Germany."24
That's what he concluded and he wrote it in his
book.
That is why no one has heard of him, why none of
his research or conclusions have been implemented in the practice of
politics the world over, and why the Nuremberg defendants had to die. It's
why political psychologists are still focused on testing for "political
biases among voters" and other interesting tidbits that miss the mark when
it comes to the truly important issues.
And it's why the only thing anyone remembers
about the Nazis at Nuremburg were their Rorschach protocols!
Meet the New Boss, Same as the Old Boss
Pretty much every current pet theory
that attempts to explain the source of evil - the "enemy" in our midst - is
wrong.
There is no singular "Nazi mind", just as there
isn't an "Islamic mind" or even a "Western or American mind" that is the
source of all evil. Fighting "Islam" or even "American imperialism" will get
us nowhere.
The fact is, psychopaths exist in all human
groups and they play an essential role in the politics of corruption,
gaining support from individuals - normal and disordered. In short, the very
qualities we often identify as those of a typical politician are those of a
psychopath. They are present in all governments, and, given the right
conditions, they create and maintain systems of oppression that know many
labels: fascism, dictatorship, authoritarianism, communism, theocracy, and
even democracy.
As long as we focus on the name, we ignore the
cause, and we play right into their hands.

The Dangers of Pit Bulls and Climate Control
12 November 2010
I hope you are all getting the point of this
series so far: psychopaths are a big problem in our world! But it's not that
simple.
Take an analogy. Timmy is sick. He caught a bug
at school the other week and is down for the count. Thankfully for his
parents, they're somewhat eccentrically obsessed with health and cleanliness
and had immediately placed Timmy in a microbiologically sterile bubble in
their guest bedroom, before proceeding to decontaminate the entire house and
its occupants.
The pathogen that threatens the health of those
he might come in contact with is successfully locked in. (Unfortunately for
Timmy, so is he!) However, Timmy's parents didn't factor Sunshine, the
family's pet pit-bull, into their anti-infection equation.
So, one afternoon, while Timmy is reminiscing about his former life outside
the bubble, along comes Sunshine who pokes a hole in the bubble's protective
layer with his favorite stick. The highly contagious, airborne infection is
now free to surf the air waves of 21st century climate control,
and through a series of highly improbable events, Timmy's sister, parents,
dog and goldfish all come down with the nasty bug.
The infection then spreads throughout the
neighborhood, city, and eventually, the world, as local businessmen who
don't mind an aggressive pat down from the TSA and exposing their genitals
to puerile airport security personnel via Peeping-Tom-Technology, travel to
very serious and important business meetings.
So, what's the point of this? Simply put,
psychopaths need a number of things to have their effect in lieu of the
direct interaction of personal relationships. Among a psychopath's best
tools to spread his malevolence are fanatic bulldogs and the cold theories
of human nature that determine the intellectual climate of a society.
It's through these intermediaries that our
bodies and minds are systematically infected - ponerized.
In this article I'll focus on the latter of these tools. For now, all that
needs to be said of the fanatics is that the tenacity of true believers
(whether paranoid or just lacking important functionality of the prefrontal
lobes) is what keeps pathological social systems in action. Just think of
Internet trolls with religion and guns, seeing a Communist or terrorist
behind every even slightly 'liberal' blogger, and you'll get the picture.
As for the second type of psycho-puppet, they're
a bit trickier to spot. Often intelligent, and highly influential in
society, the pervasiveness of their theories in modern Western culture
offers them some degree of camouflage. But when those theories are put to
the test, they don't fare too well.
Unfortunately for us, very few actually question
them, and they're the cause of many of the world's biggest problems.
In his book, Born to be Good: The Science of a Meaningful Life (New
York: Norton, 2009), professor of psychology at the University of
California, Dacher Keltner lists some depressing figures.
In the last fifteen years, levels of trust among
Americans have dropped 15%; feelings of social anomie, loneliness, and
unhappy marriages are on the rise; people have fewer close friends, babies
have less physical contact with their parents, and American children's
well-being ranks twentieth in a list of 21 nations. Keltner traces this
overall decline in social well-being to what he calls the Homo economicus
ideology of human nature.
He writes:
This ideology has influential advocates from
Sigmund Freud to evolutionary theorists. The strongest proponents of
this view are found in the halls of economics departments. Their
characterization of human nature [is] known widely as rational choice
theory... First and foremost, Homo economicus is selfish.
Every action of Homo economicus is designed
to maximize self-interest, in the form of experienced pleasure, advances
in material wealth, or, in evolutionist thought, the propagation of
genes... Competition is a natural and normative state of affairs...
Cooperation and kindness are, by implication, cultural conventions or
deceptive acts masking deeper self-interest...
The conclusion: These generous acts are
evolutionary "misfires" or "strategic errors"...
(pp. 8 - 9)
Keltner mentions just a few such theorizers: the
already-mentioned Freud, Ayn Rand, Machiavelli ("in general [mankind] are
fickle, hypocritical, and greedy of gain"), and George C. Williams (Natural
selection "can honestly be described as a process for maximizing
short-sighted selfishness").
To this list we may add Karl Marx (for whom
material conditions shape consciousness) and Thomas Hobbes (1588 - 1679),
who thought that so long as there were no strong authority to keep them in
line, humans were naturally,
"in that condition which is called war; and such
a war as is of every man against every man".
(quoted in Steven Pinker's The
Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature (New York: Penguin, 2002), p.
7)
In other words, human nature is so wretched
(i.e. self-serving, distrustful, malicious) that a strong authority (i.e.
church or state) is needed to keep society from descending into social
chaos.
Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.
As Keltner
describes it, such a view of human nature offers only part of the picture.
Without the very real qualities of equality, compassion, cooperation,
gratitude, love, laughter and nurture, our families and societies would fall
apart.
These emotions and values are what bring, and
keep, people together, and coincidentally (or not), they are the very
qualities lacking in psychopaths.
In fact, some big clues to this can be found in Adam Curtis' 2007
documentary The Trap - What Happened to Our Dream of Freedom (below video). In it, Curtis
shows the influence of "simplistic model[s] of human beings as self-seeking,
almost robotic, creatures" on modern economics and politics (are we seeing a
pattern here?).
One such model is the "Game Theory" of
mathematician and Nobel Prize winner in Economics John Nash, whose
life was whitewashed in the Hollywood film A Beautiful Mind.
Importantly,
Nash was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, although in my opinion "schizoidal
psychopathy" is a better fit. His arrogant, cold-hearted, and disturbed mind
is dealt with at length in Sylvia Nasar's biography of the same name.
Nash's view of human nature influenced the
development of his "game" scenarios, which in turn greatly influenced
official Cold War policies.
According to Nash, human beings are selfish and distrustful by nature, and
the only way to create social stability is through the cultivation of
suspicion and self-interest. In one of his games, players must choose to
trust or betray their gaming partner in order to either lose or gain
benefits. Trust only works if both sides choose to do so.
If your opponent "screws you", however, you lose
more than you would if you screwed him as well. The choice with the greatest
payoff is thus to betray your partner, who in turn betrays you.
According to
Nash, as well as other economic theorists like Friedrich von Hayek and
James
M. Buchanan, this is how humans actually operate:
motivated entirely by
self-interest and constantly calculating and anticipating the malicious
intentions of all others.
Thus, Homo economicus.
Life is one big game of
screwing others over, and coming out on top.
That's great in theory, I suppose. However, in practice, the only
individuals who consistently played the games in such a manner were
psychopaths and economists! When the games were played by the experimenters'
secretaries, they always chose the mutually beneficial trust scenario, that
is, the normal, human response.
And while these theories of economic and
political "freedom" were embraced by politicians such as Margaret Thatcher
and continue to determine economic and government policies in Western
societies, as Curtis concludes, when they are put into practice they
actually lead to "corruption, rigidity, inequality."
See how far Timmy's bug can spread?
As can be seen by the names mentioned above (Machiavelli, Hobbes, Marx,
etc.), the view of humanity as nothing but selfish imps has long held sway.
Religious traditions have taught their believers to view themselves as
"special" and set apart from the rest of humanity, which is seen as
wretched, brutish, amoral, and Godless. (In other words, Homo economicus-lite; only the others are evil.)
It is so universal that it seems to be a rule
among religious sects, whether in the Talmudic view of goyim, the Christian
view of the "un-saved", or the Muslim view of the kafir. So, too, in
political theories. As the game theory tests showed in The Trap, normal
people tend trust one another.
It is what Hare called our "intra-species
predator" - psychopaths - who are themselves distrustful by nature, and who
then inspire distrust in others; it is they who are selfish, and inspire
selfishness in others; and it is they who wish to be the ones controlling
the 'rabble of humanity'.
And when we take a hard look at the laws and cultural norms that these
pseudo-people promote (and which we take for granted), we see that they're
most often based on this imaginary, invented, simplified view of human
nature. It's everywhere we look. In his book Lie Detectors: A Social
History, Kerry Segrave documents some of the absurd methods of lie detection
used in our history.
For example, from ancient India and Iran to
Europe of the Middle Ages, methods such as the "red-hot iron ordeal", where
the accused is found guilty if he suffers burns from a red-hot piece of
metal, have been used as methods for lie detection. Obviously both the
guilty and innocent will be burned, but authorities defended their
techniques with any number of cockamamie explanations.
In the present day, torture techniques whose
true nature is softened by euphemisms such as "advanced interrogation
techniques" are used to break down the accused to the point where they will
confess to anything, as was the case with alleged 9/11 "mastermind" Khalid
Sheikh Mohammed, who was
waterboarded 183 times in a single month.
Mohammed confessed to a litany of crimes, which
included targeting a bank founded
four years after his arrest. The
applications aren't always so extreme, however. In court, jurors easily
doubt the testimony of a seemingly 'mentally-imbalanced' (i.e. emotional)
person, especially when it is his or her word against a cool-headed,
well-respected psychopath who lies with ease and absolute certitude.
The injustice of the situation, and the
unbelievable chutzpah displayed by the psychopath, is enough to drive an
innocent party into an emotional fit, ruining their credibility.
We've largely inherited our legal system from the Romans.
While the Greeks were more concerned with
literature, mythology, and strictly philosophical philosophizing (among
other more questionable activities), the Romans took a more utilitarian
approach. With large populations to control and a deficit in understanding
of human nature (what is it with half-wits ruling vast portions of the
globe, anyways?!), the administrative and political practicalities of empire
outweighed the Greek ideals of sober reflection and discovery.
Their legal system became a 'one-size-fits-all'
enterprise conceived for the "statistically average" (and equally
non-existent) human. Not even the Jesus peoples' notion of the "kingdom of
God" - which caused quite a stir among the plebes in the first century after
Jesus, basing itself on natural human relationships of respect, love,
and understanding - managed to temper the Roman mentality when Christianity
was assimilated into the empire's political machinery in the fourth century.
In short, we inherited this Roman tendency to
submit human nature to The Law and not vice versa.
For millennia these culturally ingrained blind spots have hindered our
ability to comprehend human and social reality in all its complexity, making
us individually and collectively vulnerable to psychopathic influences. The
reason for this is that the roots of human evil are found within the very
human variety and complexity that is denied by commonly promoted beliefs
about humanity.
By our ignorance of their existence, they remain
hidden in plain sight. In fact, humans are not all the same. Psychopaths
have very little in common with the rest of humanity, and it is they who
exploit the gap between our unrealistic beliefs and the actual truth of the
matter, as in the legal cases mentioned above.
The funny thing about these theories is that they end up revealing more
about the nature of those making the theories than about humanity in
general. Łobaczewski provides the key to this puzzle. According to him,
schizoid individuals (think Robert DeNiro's character Travis Bickle in Taxi
Driver, or Rorschach in Watchmen) as a rule have such a misanthropic view of
human nature.
Because of their own shallow emotions and
unstable personalities, they have trouble seeing in others the qualities
that they themselves lack, like true empathy, altruism, and cooperation.
Instead, they tend to create baroque and icy theories with no basis in
reality.
They project their own limitations into
self-evident, 'universal' values, and when their books are mass-produced,
and their ideas spread throughout the public, academia, economics, and
politics, that spells trouble.
For example, in addition to the unfortunate influence of Freud on
psychiatry, the behaviorists have largely dominated the field of psychology.
Taking empiricism to its limits, they concluded that because mental
processes could not be directly studied in the laboratory, the mind could
not be said to exist at all - all there is is behavior!
As anyone with a mind knows, this is patently
absurd.
Visualization, imagination, and higher emotions are just a few of
the essential human qualities denied by behaviorism. Rather, the
behaviorists attempted to extrapolate human qualities from the observation
of animals - their reflexes, formed habits, and learning processes. While
much was learned in the process, it led to a vicious circle within
psychology.
By denying truly human qualities and abilities,
they ended up with grossly lobotomized theories of human nature.
As John B. Watson infamously said:
Give me a dozen healthy infants,
well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I'll
guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of
specialist I might select - doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief, and
yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants,
tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors.
(quoted in Pinker, p. 19)
As was the case with Nash and Hobbes, these
theories tell us more about the minds of the theorists themselves than about
humanity as a whole.
Taken as a group, behaviorists can actually tell
us something about the true variety within human nature. Because psychology
is the only discipline where both the subject and object of study are the
same, it's easy for subjective errors and faulty core assumptions to slip
into the reasoning process.
Studying the core assumptions about human nature
present in the writings of influential scientific, economic, and religious
thinkers is a powerful aid in beefing up our sense of smell. We might just
catch a whiff of a truly pathological mindset. But such a keen sense can be
a dangerous thing.
Psychology, after all, is the first science to
be outlawed and Stalinized in a society governed by pathocracy, because of
its potential to identify the true nature, causes, processes, and weaknesses
of the system.
Psychopaths rely on the tacit acceptance of such theories by the masses of
humanity. Think about it. In our daily lives, such ideas are mere "Sunday
beliefs" - we may accept them in economics class, or the psychology lab, but
when we get home to our families, social instinct is what drives us. We
still hug and kiss our children before bed, worry about their futures, make
sacrifices for their well-being. We want them to be happy, and we do what we
can to make it a reality.
What does it matter that some strange, obscure economists hold such absurd
beliefs? Oh, yeah... Inequality, social anomie, depression, poverty,
economic shock treatment, computerized warfare, poisonous pharmaceuticals,
frankenfood, pollution, corporate enslavement, and on and on and on.
The fact is, even if we may tend to live our
lives with some modicum of humanity, societal beliefs affect us all.
Schizoidal misanthropy affects us all. But besides these very tangible
effects, besides the fact that their ideals are spread and implemented by
our leaders, belief systems limit the range of concepts with which our minds
can 'play'.
They're like blinders on a carriage-horse. When
we leave out what is human, and forbid anything ponerological, we'll be
lucky if the carriage doesn't smash to pieces when it is run off the cliff
of time and history.
So, no, I'm not recommending we all start living in bubbles (analogies, mine
at least, can only go so far).
But just as our health depends on the
functioning of our immune system, our psychological and societal well-being
depends on the degree of our knowledge about ponerology. If the "trap" set
by the theories mentioned above is the fact that they are speculative and
divorced of any relation to human and social reality, the obvious solution
is to come to a solid understanding of human nature - the human individual
in all its scope and variety.
So take off your blinders, give someone you love
a hug, and let's get down to exposing the individuals who have flushed our
world down the drainpipe.

example of Kevin Morrissey, managing editor for the Virginia Quarterly
Review, who was
driven to suicide after repeated harassment and belittlement
by his boss, Ted Genoways.
Morrissey's plight is a perennial one, and it gets right to the heart of
ponerology. Criminal psychopaths get drunk, get in fights, lead lives of
serial criminality, and when they kill people, they tend to use weapons, or
any convenient object that happens to be laying around. Successful
psychopaths, on the other hand, lead relatively "normal" lives.
They don't break the law (at least overtly) and
can come across as ideal and highly successful citizens. But whether it's
after years of pushing boundaries, tearing down a person's will to live with
soul-eating mind-torture, or the "collateral damage" caused by the toxic
chemicals their corporations release simply because they just don't care and
can make a quick buck, successful psychopaths kill too.
The main difference is, they kill a lot more,
and they get away with it.
But it's not just the corporate bigwigs and
Tucker Max-esque "boyfriends".
As we've seen, a look at the machinations of political groups like the
Soviets and the Nazis with the same perspective is quite revealing.
Psychopaths gaining access and prominence in political groups use the same
five-phase process as the those studied by Babiak.
And not only does the five-phase process occur
within the cutthroat dynamics of "power politics", it also occurs as the
group as a whole strives for and achieves political domination. Or, to add a
little color to counter that somewhat academic exposition: scum rises to the
top. It's how it gets there that is interesting, and those early stages are
the most elusive and poorly studied.
Until Lobaczewski wrote his book, that is.
As Babiak describes, the first phase of manipulation is gaining entry into
the group. This is fairly easy for a psychopath in a political environment
(e.g., Blagojevich, Cheney, Netanyahu, Mubarak, etc.), and given the
motivations and personality types that characterize a revolutionary group
such as the fledgling Nazis, even more so. Thuggish gangs need thuggish
goons and are happy to sign them up and put a gun, taser, or pen in their
hands.
Likewise, groups with political aspirations
value psychopathic traits, and schemers like Stalin's handler, L.P. Beria,
for example, are a perfect fit.
Politicians must be charming, convincing, facile
liars, willing and able to destroy others' characters and lives to support
their rise to power. Contrary to the whimsical fancy of hardcore fans of one
political team or another, politicians cynically adopt whatever party label
suits their purposes, "Left" or "Right".
But such labels are merely means to an end,
tools to be exploited, as is everything else in the psychopath's
environment, leading to the alienation of those who eventually learn that
there's a whole lot of "sound and fury, signifying nothing" behind the
national games we term elections.
Torturer L.P. Beria holding Stalin's daughter, Svetlana,
whom he is rumored
to have sexually abused.
In the early stages of political movements, as the core group or party
attempts to gain power of a country, a convincing mask (often humanitarian
in nature) may be required.
People like politicians who kiss babies and
promise to do "good" things. Imagine an aspiring politico releasing this
press bio:
"John B. Handsome enjoys watching people suffer, inflicting
bodily harm at a distance, and raping young children."
Ain't gonna happen,
despite the fact that it's probably true (see Dave McGowan's work on
pedophile rings in high places, for example).
However, once power has been entrenched, other
than a thin facade for the sake of the cameras (and the already-mentioned
fans) and foreign observers, the political psychopath is relatively free to
drop his mask and display his true nature. Beria was a typical example, as
was Hermann Göring in the Nazis. Everyone knew they were "monsters" and they
made no bones about it.
After all, who was going to do anything about
it?
The second, assessment phase of the political psychopath's rise to power is
a war on two fronts. He must not only identify possible targets and rivals
within the group, but also on the outside. Within, he identifies those most
dangerous to his own ambition, those whose support he must cultivate, e.g.
influential power brokers, or patrons, and the pawns he will manipulate and
use as patsies to guarantee his own ascendance as an "important"
power-possessing being.
Outside the group are political rivals, critics,
and existing authorities who threaten to curb the group's hold of power
and/or who need to be threatened or otherwise "enticed" to give their
support. And, of course, there are those who know where the skeletons are
buried. They're just a heart attack or "freak single engine plane crash"
away from no longer being a problem.
Just as corporate psychopaths cultivate alliances and relationships with
influential executives to ensure their protection, political psychopaths
secure their power by winning the influence of a society's powerful legal,
military, economic, and business institutions, as well as those of foreign
nations.
In the third, manipulation phase, political
psychopaths take advantage of all these groups, creating and maintaining
their own psychopathic fiction on a mass scale, spreading positive
propaganda about themselves and negative propaganda about their perceived
(and often entirely created) "enemies", and creating and stage-managing the
conflicts that solidify their positions.
The incestuous marriage of corporate, economic,
military, and political power ends up creating a virtually unconquerable
system of control.
While in the Nazis studied by Gustav Gilbert the career diplomats and
militarists were in fact the least characterized by psychopathology, it is
easy to see why these "sophisticated realists" of the state were so easily
manipulated. The motivations of this political bandwagon were clear; they
were social climbers, political opportunists, and strongly identified with
their own social group.
After all, these men were the leading figures
(i.e. the leading social conformists) in the functions of state, law,
church, and capital, and their desire to be among the new ruling elite
proved much stronger than their willingness to face a disgraceful fall down
the social ladder, or worse, be labeled an "enemy of the state" (G. Gilbert,
The Psychology of Dictatorship, pp. 154 - 5).
These men were products of the authoritarian
culture that permeated Germany before Nazism, in which submission to
authority was a cultural norm, no matter the nature of that authority. In
the face of this "new reality", men like the one-time chancellor of the
Weimar Republic, Franz von Papen, took the path of least resistance and
appeased the psychopathic aggression they witnessed.
The militarists, too, succumbed to the incentives to promotion and their own
blind obedience to authority. Even despite considering shooting himself over
the "misgivings" he had about many of his orders, Field Marshall Keitel
followed through to the last because of his sense of loyalty to a superior.
It's no different today.
Scientists still want to keep their jobs and
funding, military men and women want their promotions, and state employees
large and small know on which side their bread is buttered.
As Gilbert described it, dictatorships thrive on social chaos, brute force,
and appeasement. Just as common psychopaths rely on the appeasement of
relatives, spouses, friends, employers, police and courts, who often
rationalize their behavior or respond that there's nothing they can do,
political psychopaths rely on the appeasement of their own citizens as well
as the nations of the world. In the psychopath's worldview, where compromise
is regarded as a sign of weakness, appeasement only makes his behavior more
malignant.
Psychopaths are masters at testing their limits.
As they get away with increasingly brazen acts, they keep pushing the
boundaries until it's too late to make a difference.
The political psychopath is free to take the
fourth, confrontation phase to the limit.
Rivals do not just lose their
positions; they are slandered, arrested, tortured, and murdered. Law
enforcement and the courts pose no threat; they're in the Party's back
pocket (remember phase three). The media is censored and controlled, and all
material critical of the government is discredited by specially chosen
"experts". Idealists who were useful in the early stages of the Party are
discarded now that their support is no longer useful.
Entire populations become scapegoats, which
serves the functions of,
-
suppressing criticism
-
conditioning the public to accept
violent "defense against our enemies"
-
incentives for conformity and "toeing
the party line"
As Babiak discovered about corporate
psychopaths, "organizational chaos" not only attracts them to companies, but
it provides them "cover".
At such times,
"an organization is at its
weakest point and prone to manipulation".
(Babiak, "From Darkness Into the
Light: Psychopathy in Industrial and Organizational Psychology", in Herve
and Yuille's The Psychopath: Theory, Research, and Practice, p. 420)
Normal people tend to avoid such environments,
but psychopaths thrive in them.
Just as corporate psychopaths exploit
organizational chaos, political psychopaths exploit social chaos. After all,
group loyalties and hostilities provide the soil in which political conflict
and aggression thrive. Long-held prejudices and stereotypes persist and
become grist for the mill of ambitious politicians.
The tensions, fears, frustrations, and
aspirations of significant numbers within the population are easily
manipulated by providing politically expedient outlets for aggression.
In the case Germany, with a population of Serbs, Croats, Hungarians, Czechs,
Slavs, Jews, Catholics, and Protestants, conflicts were easy to exploit. The
devastation of WWI and the chaos it engendered created a hole, which was to
be filled by new social and political reforms. New ideas were adopted and
adapted to serve the aggressive purposes of the Nazi revolutionary core.
Evolution justified ethnic struggles based on
pseudoscience, and economic laws implied "implacable class warfare".
The Nazis began as rebels but gained the support
of many Germans through their masterful manipulation of popular opinion.
They eventually achieved power by intensifying social conflicts and
maintained it by a reign of terror.
For the fanatics of a regime, these policies are personal vendettas, while
psychopaths use them more calculatedly, as convenient devices to accrue
power. Stereotypes are self-perpetuating mechanisms, and they suit the
political psychopath well.
Gilbert writes,
"The exceptional case which
confirms the prejudice will have sensational repercussions, while the cases
in which the reverse is true, or no racial lines are crossed, will pass
comparatively unnoticed".
(p. 290)
This process is further facilitated by
propaganda.
Those members of the targeted group who react
defensively are seen as proof of the stereotype, and those who try to
conform to the discriminating majority are seen as a
sinister fifth column -
"surely they cannot have good intentions!"
Social discrimination actually fosters the
development of group differences, which can then be identified as evidence
for the stereotype. For example, slaves may have been kept uneducated,
becoming evidence for their own "mental inferiority"; the intelligentsia
killed and the people deemed "backwards" and "primitive".
New realities are simply created and then taken
as "evidence" for whatever those manipulating reality seek to promote.
How convenient.
Hitler was a great success in this regard. His paranoia, aggression against
his "enemies" and obsessive appeal to national ascendancy deeply resonated
with and anchored in the minds of Germans, and his duplicity reached the
level of national policy, hiding the Party's ulterior motives behind
plausible cover stories and grandiose ideals.
As Gilbert remarked,
"Even a constitution presented no serious
obstacle to dictatorship, since many of its provisions could be
suspended in a 'national emergency' where the security of the nation was
threatened; and such emergencies, as Napoleon knew only too well, could
always be provided by propaganda".
(p. 8)
Patsy Marinus van der Lubbe.
One such "emergency", which also made use of another technique often used by
political psychopaths to create social chaos, and which was pivotal in the
consolidation of Nazi power, was the Reichstag fire of February 27, 1933.
Perhaps the most significant patsy in history
(aside from Lee Harvey Oswald, of course), Dutch communist Marinus van der
Lubbe was accused, tried, and executed for the crime. In fact, the latest
German research has shown this was another "false-flag" operation on the
part of the Nazis. According to testimony heard at Nuremberg, the fire was
part of Goebbel's propaganda campaign and was carried out in collusion with
Göring and the Berlin Storm Troops.
A self-inflicted wound, the Nazis staged the
fire so that they could then use it as "evidence" of a communist plot
against the government.
The "state of emergency" caused by this
"Communist threat" necessitated extreme measures. Soon after, the Enabling
Act was passed, which essentially gave Hitler unlimited powers.
Totalitarianism was implemented first by outlawing the Communist and Social
Democratic Parties, and by the end of the year, all the rest.
Finally, Himmler was given extraordinary police
powers to suppress all "dangers to public security," in accordance with a
new law providing the death penalty for such undefined offenses. (Gilbert,
p. 72)
Those who knew too much about the Reichstag fire, among others whose loyalty
was in question, were rounded up and killed on June 30, 1934. Executions
were still illegal at the time, but Hitler justified them as essential for
the protection and safety of the Reich. Hitler now determined the law in
Germany.
The parallels between the Machiavellian, manipulative natures of both the
psychopath and modern "power politics" are so obvious that it is difficult
not to recall Cleckley's "conspiracy of silence" about the topic of
psychopathy as a whole. While alternative writers on the Internet are
consistently making the connections, the topic has yet to reach the
mainstream in any serious form.
Gilbert's study has been forgotten by mainstream
psychologists, and Lobaczewski's has been completely ignored. In fact,
American Psychiatric Association members (e.g., CIA contractor James Elmer
Mitchell and his colleague Bruce Jessen) even helped
develop and participate
in the CIA's "advanced interrogation" of "enemy combatants" in Guantanamo
bay and CIA black sites.
Rather than coming to understand the realities
of torture in order to stop it, American psychologists are actively engaging
in it, using the same tortured logic used by Hitler and Goebbels seventy
years ago. If there's one sure sign that a government is psychopathic,
that's its use and justification of torture, and the spineless denials and
redefinitions to excuse its utter barbarity.
If we trace the roots of psychopathic thinking in more detail, we come back
to phase-three psychopathic techniques of "divide and rule" and
disinformation. The formula is fairly straightforward.
The psychopath determines that he needs someone
to perform a certain action. So, he sets up a situation causing the person
to react in the desired manner. In this way he manages conflicts that
neutralize threats and promote his own self-image. On the mass scale these
manufactured realities reach dangerous heights of criminality.
Ambitious politicians use their influence among
secret police, military, and intelligence to perpetrate attacks on their own
civilian populations, which are then blamed on a created "enemy". Public
reaction follows the predicted vector and the politicians offer the
"solution" (prepared in advance) of war against the enemy.
This cynical and twisted reality is not an
isolated phenomenon. It is standard operating procedure among major
political/intelligence elites.
By applying Babiak's five-phase model, we can identify several cycles within
cycles in the creation and maintenance of dictatorship: the individual,
national, and international.
In the first, an individual psychopath like
Göring achieves entry and influence within a political movement. In the
second, a political group manipulated by psychopaths takes control of a
country. In the third, they expand their influence, invading and taking over
other countries in the hopes of securing world domination.
This grand cycle of world government - to which
Hitler and the Nazis aspired and yet were unable to accomplish - was and is
the desire of all great empires. Its necessity is clear. If the dictatorship
contains itself within its own borders, it risks losing its power to outside
forces, whether from invasion or the influence of outsiders on its own
populations, thus stirring anti-government movements within its own borders.
Dictatorships must constantly expand their
influence in order to stave off the "dangerous" ideas of more liberal
governments.
That is not to say that they will ever be successful, just that
it is the nature of those involved to ever grasp for more, lest they lose it
all. In fact, while such governments can stabilize their power for decades
(e.g., the Soviet empire) or even centuries (e.g., the Roman empire), so far
the rule has been that they all suffer defeat, whether from within or
without.
The smallest cycle can occur any number of times and during any and all
phases of larger cycles.
For example, psychopaths may play their political
game before or after a Party has gained power. The constant jockeying for power within the
system of government is an essential feature, as seen in the various
"purges", convenient "suicides", and "disappearings" that have always
characterized corrupt empires.
While such governments strike most of
humanity as harsh and oppressive, the free license provided by a police
state is ideal for the political psychopath.
From Gilbert:
He obtains gratification from manipulating
the environment for the feeling of power it affords, to act the
aggressive hero for the sheer pleasure of acting.
He is too egocentric to love or hate very
deeply, though the outward show of such emotions may be part of the role
he plays. His violation of the social mores is not a neurotic obsession
but an incidental aspect of this aggressive role-playing. In situations
of social conflict, he identifies with the group that provides the best
outlet of aggression for aggression's sake...
Craving applause for his showmanship, he
[may play] the role of aggressive champion of human rights, if the stage
[is] set for such a role.
(p. 284)
I've have already mentioned several of the
essential features of pathocracy identified by Gilbert: social unrest, brute
force against enemies within and without, a favorable constellation of
leadership groups with mutual interests, and crucial events facilitating the
consolidation of dictatorial power.
Psychopathic leaders also require authoritarian
followers, and an authoritarian social framework:
The hierarchical social structure...
provides the rewards of obedience and parasitism, security of status,
outlets for aggression in situations of sibling rivalry and dominance of
subordinates.
(Gilbert, p. 268)
In an authoritarian society, people submit to
the protection of leadership, accepting their decisions and forfeiting their
own ability to make their own choices.
"My leaders make the choices so I don't have
to."
When this system is taken away - as a result of
radical social change often initiated by war or revolution - the citizens'
toleration for insecurity lessens and they readily accept appeals to the
old, conservative ways.
The world has seen this process in action in the
"global war on terror".
The attempt by Western governments to "export
democracy" inevitably results in a regression to conservative, authoritarian
regimes. The Taliban has regained its influence in Afghanistan after the
United States and its allies invaded in 2001, ostensibly to "bring freedom"
to the Afghanis. Similarly, Iraq is now a democracy in name only and is
plagued with corruption, occupation, and daily military atrocities.
Again, the "conspiracy of silence" makes its
presence known. The scum and effluent rises to the top. Eventually, however,
it gets to the point where every almost-normal individual can smell its
stench and putrescence. The Egyptians have recently caught a whiff.
Hopefully the rest of
the world will catch on
soon.
