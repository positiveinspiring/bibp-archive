The Surveillance State has created an apparatus whose implications are
staggering.
Its a different world now. And sometimes it takes a writer of
fiction to flesh out the larger landscape.
Brad Thors new novel,
Black List, posits the existence of a monster
corporation,
ATS (Adaptive Technology Solutions), that stands along side
the NSA in collecting information
on every move we make.
ATS intelligence-gathering capability is unmatched
anywhere in the world.
At his site, the author lists some of the open-source
material he discovered that formed the basis for Black List. The
material, as well as the novel, is worth reading (read "Review
- Black List by Brad Thor".)
On pages 117-118 of Black List, Thor makes a stunning inference that, on
reflection, is as obvious as the fingers on your hand:
For years ATS had been using its technological superiority to conduct
massive insider trading. Since the early 1980s, the company had spied on
anyone and everyone in the financial world.
They listened in on phone calls,
intercepted faxes, and evolved right along with the technology, hacking
internal computer networks and e-mail accounts. They created mountains of
black dollars for themselves, which they washed through various programs
they were running under secret contract, far from the prying eyes of
financial regulators.
Those black dollars were invested into hard assets around the world, as
well as in the stock market, through sham, offshore corporations. They also
funneled the money into reams of promising R&D projects, which eventually
would be turned around and sold to the Pentagon or the CIA.
In short, ATS had created
its own license to print money and had assured
itself a place beyond examination or reproach.
In real life, whether the prime criminal source is one monster corporation
or a consortium of companies, or elite banks, or the NSA itself, the outcome
would be the same.
It would be as Thor describes it.
We think about total surveillance as being directed at private citizens, but
the capability has unlimited payoffs when it targets financial markets and
the people who have intimate knowledge of them.
Total security awareness programs of surveillance are ideal spying ops in
the financial arena, designed to suck up millions of bits of inside
information, then utilizing them to make investments and suck up billions
(trillions?) of dollars.
It gives new meaning to the rich get richer.
Taking the overall scheme to another level, consider this: those same heavy
hitters who have unfettered access to financial information can also choose,
at opportune moments, to expose certain scandals and crimes (not their own,
of course).
In this way, they can, at their whim, cripple governments, banks, and
corporations. They can cripple investment houses, insurance companies, and
hedge funds. Or, alternatively, they can merely blackmail these
organizations.
We think we know how scandals are exposed by the press, but actually we
dont. Tips are given to people who give them to other people. Usually, the
first clue that starts the ball rolling comes from a source who remains in
the shadows.
What we are talking about here is the creation and managing of realities on
all sides, including the choice of when and where and how to provide a
glimpse of a crime or scandal.
Its likely that the probe Ron Paul has been pushing - audit the Federal
Reserve - has already been done by those who control unlimited global
surveillance. They already know far more than any Congressional
investigation will uncover. If they know the deepest truths, they can use
them to blackmail, manipulate, and control the Fed itself.
The information matrix can be tapped into and plumbed, and it can also be
used to dispense choice clusters of data that end up constituting the media
reality of painted pictures which, every day, tell billions of people
whats news.
In this global-surveillance world, we need to ask new questions and think
along different lines now.
For example,
-
How long before the mortgage-derivative crisis hit did the
Masters of Surveillance know, from spying on bank records, that
insupportable debt was accumulating at a lethal pace?
-
What did they do with
that information?
-
When did they know that at least a trillion dollars was missing from
Pentagon accounting books (as Donald Rumsfeld eventually admitted), and what
did they do with that information?
-
Did they discover precisely where the trillion dollars went?
-
Did they
discover where billions of dollars, in cash, shipped to post-war Iraq,
disappeared to?
-
When did they know the details of the Libor rate-fixing scandal? Press
reports indicate that Barclays was trying to rig interest rates as early as
January 2005.
-
Have they tracked, in detail, the men responsible for recruiting hired
mercenaries and terrorists, who eventually wound up in Syria pretending to
be an authentic rebel force?
-
Have they discovered the truth about how close or how far away Iran is from
producing a nuclear weapon?
-
Have they collected detailed accounts of the most private plans of
Bilderberg,
CFR, and
Trilateral Commission leaders?
For global surveillance kings, what we think of as the future is, in many
respects the present and the past.
Its a new world...
These overseers of universal information-detection can
enter and probe the most secret caches of data, collect, collate, cross
reference, and assemble them into vital bottom-lines.
By comparison, an
operation like Wikileaks is an old Model-T Ford puttering down a country
road, and Julian Assange, reviled as a terrorist, is a mere piker.
Previously, we thought we needed to look over the shoulders of the men who
were committing major crimes out of public view. But now, if we want to be
up to date, we also have to factor in the men who are spying on those
criminals, who are gathering up those secrets and using them to commit their
own brand of meta-crime.
And in the financial arena, that means we think of Goldman Sachs and JP
Morgan as perpetrators, yes, but we also think about the men who already
know everything about GS and Morgan, and are using this knowledge to steal
sums that might make GS and Morgan blush with envy.
