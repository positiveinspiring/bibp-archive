# Cheney, Rothschild, and Fox NewsÂ’ Murdoch to Drill for Oil in Syria, 
Violating International Law

While Syria is torn apart by the
warring of U.S. imperialists and Islamic fundamentalists -
leaving its children to die of starvation - another country
plans to take advantage of the chaos by stealing resources from
Syria's southern region.
The theft will be carried out by the
most notorious pushers of military hegemony, and they don't care
that it violates international law.
Genie Energy is an
American-based oil and gas company with major investors and
advisors comprising a who's who list of war profiteers:
The president of their Israeli
subsidiary is
Efraim "Effi"
Eitam, an
Israeli military commander who
called for expelling the "cancer" of Arabs
from Israel.
Together, these warmongers and
would-be ethnic cleansers will
soon be drilling into a vast oil and gas reserve located in
the Syrian territory occupied by Israel since 1967, known as
Golan Heights.
The move would be in clear violation
of international law, specifically the
Annex to the Fourth Geneva Convention.
Israeli authorities granted Genie
Energy's subsidiary,
Afek Oil and Gas, exclusive petroleum
exploration rights in a 153-square-mile region in Golan Heights.
In 2015, above-ground geophysical
tests discovered the presence of oil and natural gas reserves
that could make Israel energy self-sufficient. Afek has already
drilled three exploratory wells.
Israel has benefited from its
illegal occupation of Syria's Golan Heights for decades,
drawing one-third of its entire water supply from the region
and providing a tourist and skiing destination at the Mount
Hermon Ski Resort.
Despite persistent international
pressure, including from the U.S., the occupation continues and
will reach a new level with the extraction of fossil fuels.
Rupert Murdoch heralded his
involvement in Genie Energy by
touting the prosperity and freedom it will bring to the
world.
"Covering and distributing news
has been my life's work," said Mr. Murdoch.
"If Genie's effort to develop
shale oil is successful, as I believe it will be, then the
news we'll report in the coming decades will reflect a more
prosperous, more democratic, and more secure world."
Of course, the war-stricken,
starving, desperate people of Syria will never see a shred of
that prosperity and security.
Murdoch's Fox "news" channel has
been instrumental in pushing war in the Middle East and
obfuscating the role played by the U.S. in fomenting the Syrian
war, and soon he and his cronies will be reaping the profits.
While they make plans to steal
energy resources from illegally occupied Syria, Genie Energy
engages in
publicity stunts to pre-empt the criticism that will
undoubtedly follow. Last Christmas they donated coats and toys
to needy families in Newark, New Jersey.
Drilling in Golan Heights is also
drawing concerns about its impact to drinking water supplies.
Since the reserves are locked up as
shale oil, hydraulic fracturing (fracking) would likely be used
to extract the fossil fuels. The shale oil is in close proximity
to a large aquifer which supplies drinking water to the region;
the fracking chemicals and polluted water spilled onto the
ground could contaminate this water supply.
A
temporary restraining order was issued by the Israeli High
Court in 2014, but did not last long as moneyed interests won
out.
Momentum for the illegal oil
drilling of Syrian territory by Murdoch, Cheney and the gang is
aided by the assumption that Golan Heights is already part of
Israel. Afek Oil and Gas refers to their newfound field simply
as "northern Israel."
A prominent Israeli politician,
Naftali Bennett, in 2015, called for the world to recognize
Golan Heights as Israeli territory, while calling for the
expansion of Jewish settlers in the region.
"I
want to challenge the entire world," said Bennett at
the 15th annual Herzliya Conference of the
Institute for Policy and Strategy. "I
want to give the international community an opportunity to
demonstrate their ethics. Recognize Israeli sovereignty over
the Golan Heights."
Dick Cheney, Rupert Murdoch, Jacob
Rothschild, and their henchmen have a long tradition of
promoting war in the Middle East and exploiting its oil
resources.
The cabal formed under Genie Energy,
led by the unapologetic Arab hater Effie Eitam, appears to have
nothing standing in the way of their next conquest in Syria's
Golan Heights...
