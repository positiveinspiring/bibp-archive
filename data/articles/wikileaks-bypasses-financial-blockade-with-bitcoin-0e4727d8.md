People shouldnt fear their government;
government should fear its people.
Publishers and journalists will not be
intimidated nor silenced. Now entering day
626 of the financial blockade against WikiLeaks, Julian Assange
sits in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London awaiting safe passage.
Following a massive release of secret U.S.
diplomatic cables in November 2010, donations to WikiLeaks were
blocked by,
-
Bank of America
-
VISA
-
MasterCard
-
PayPal
-
Western Union,
...on December 7th, 2010.
Although private companies certainly have a
right to select which transactions to process or not, the political
environment produced less than a fair and objective decision.
It was coordinated
pressure exerted in a politicized climate
by the U.S. government and it wont be the last time that we see this type
of pressure.
Fortunately, there is way around this and other
financial blockades with a global payment method immune to political
pressure and monetary censorship.
On its public
bitcoin address, Wikileaks has taken in over $32,000 equivalent in more
than 1,100 separate
bitcoin donations throughout the blockade
(1BTC = $10.00).
But these amounts may be significantly higher,
because it does not even include the individually-generated bitcoin
addresses that WikiLeaks provides for donors
upon
request.
Also announced last month, WikiLeaks appears to
have found another way around the VISA and Mastercard blockade by using the
French national credit card system, Carte Bleue, to process these payments
(at least temporarily).
According to
WikiLeaks, VISA and MasterCard are contractually barred from directly
cutting off merchants through the Carte Bleue system and the French
non-profit
FDNN
(Fund for the Defense of Net Neutrality- Fonds de Défense de la Net
Neutralité) has set up a Carte Bleue fund for WikiLeaks.
Time Magazine
declares that WikiLeaks,
could be as important a journalistic tool
as the Freedom of Information Act.
It used to be that people had secrets and the
government was transparent; now its the people that lack privacy and the
government has secrets.
Freedom of payments is an extension of financial
privacy and digital cash-like transactions without financial intermediaries
become a critical piece of that foundation.
Money was never intended to act as a form of
identity tracking or payments restriction and this is why the option for
anonymous and untraceable transactions is so vital as society moves to a
world of digital currency.
It is the privatization of censorship,
because this is being done because of extreme pressure by the U.S.
Government,
says Kristinn Hrafnsson, spokesman for WikiLeaks.
Its extremely important to fight back and
stop this process right here and now so that we wont see in the future,
where we have the financial giants deciding who lives and who dies in
this field.
To those that dont support freedom of
payments, consider this financial blockade invoked in the name of
political correctness before you dismiss the inherent value of a
nonpolitical unit of account and of a decentralized medium of exchange.
It should be offensive to most free-minded
people that you are not the final arbiter of how and where
you spend your money.
Bitcoin restores the balance...
