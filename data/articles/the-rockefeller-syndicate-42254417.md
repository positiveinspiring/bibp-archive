Many American conservatives believe as a matter
of faith that the Rockefellers and the Council on Foreign Relations exercise
absolute control over the government and the people of United States.
This thesis can be accepted as a working formula
if one remains conscious of the larger issues. Two writers for whom the
present writer has great respect, Dr. Emanuel Josephson and Morris Bealle,
insisted on focusing on the Rockefellers and excluding all other aspects
of the World Order. This severely limited the effect of their otherwise
ground breaking work on the Medical Monopoly.
This writer advanced a contrary view in "The World Order," fixing upon the
Rothschild monetary power, which reached a point of world control by 1885,
and its London policy group, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a
the policy makers for what has essentially been since 1900, re-established
colonial government in the United States.
The colonial, or occupation, government,
functions primarily through the
Council on Foreign Relations, but only as
the subsidiary of RIIA and through the Rockefeller Foundation which controls
government functions, the educational establishments, the media, the
religions and the state legislatures.
It is true that the American colonials have "free elections", in which they
have the absolute right to vote for one of two opposing candidates, both of
whom have been handpicked and financed by the Rockefeller syndicate. This
touching evidence of "democracy" serves to convince most Americana that we
are indeed a free people. We even have a cracked Liberty Bell in
Philadelphia to prove it.
American youth have been free since 1900 to be
marched off to die in Hegelian wars in which both combatants received their
instructions from the World Order. We are free to invest in a stock market
which the daily quantity, price and value of the monetary unit is
manipulated and controlled by a Federal Reserve System which is answerable
only to the Bank of England. It has maintained its vaunted "independence"
from our government's control, but this is the only independence it has ever
had.
The realization that we do indeed live under the dictate of the
"Rockefeller Syndicate" can well be the starting point of the long road
back of a genuine struggle for American independence. In exposing "the
Rockefellers" as agents of a foreign power, which is not merely a foreign
power, but a genuine world government, we must realize that this is not
merely a group dedicated to making money, but a group which committed to
maintaining the power of a colonial form of government over the American
people.
Thus the ancient calumny of John D. Rockefeller
as a man obsessed by greed (a category in which he has plenty of company)
obscures the act that from the day
the Rothschilds began to finance his
march towards a total oil monopoly in the United States from their coffers
at the National City Bank of Cleveland, Rockefeller was never an independent
power, nor does any department of the Rockefeller Syndicate operate as an
independent power.
We know that the Cosa Nostra, or Mafia, with
which the Syndicate is closely allied has somewhat autonomous power in the
regions which have been assigned to that particular "family" by the
national directors, but this always implies that that family remains under
total control and answerable for everything which occurs in its territory.
Similarly, the Rockefeller Syndicate operates under clearly defined spheres
of influence. The "charitable" organizations, the business companies, and
the policy groups always meld into a working operation, nor can any
department of the Syndicate strike out on its own or formulate an
independent policy, no matter what may be its justification.
The Rockefeller Syndicate operates under the control of the world financial
structure, which means that on any given day, all of its assets could be
rendered close to worthless by adroit financial manipulations. This is
the final control, which insures that no one can quit the organization. Not
only would he be stripped of all assets, but he would be under contract for
immediate assassination.
Our Department of Justice is well aware that the
only "terrorists" operating in the United States are the agents of the World
Order, but they prudently avoid any mention of this fact.
The world financial structure, far from being an unknown or hidden
organization, is actually well known and well defined.
It consists of:
-
the major Swiss Banks
-
the survivors of the old
Venetian-Genoese banking axis
-
the Big Five of the world grain trade
-
the British combine, centered in the
Bank of England and its chartered merchant banks, functioning trough
the Rothschilds and the Oppenheimers and having absolute control
over their Canadian colony through the Royal Bank of Canada and the
Bank of Montreal, their Canadian lieutenants being the Bronfmans,
Belzbergs, and other financial operators
-
the colonial banking structure in the
United States, controlled by the Bank of England through the
Federal
Reserve System
-
the Boston Brahmin families who made their fortunes
in the opium trade, including the Delanos and others and the
Rockefeller Syndicate, consisting of the Kissinger network
headquartered in the Rockefeller Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank,
American Express, the present form of the old Rothschild
representatives in the United States, which includes Kuhn, Loeb
Company and Lehman Brothers
It is notable that the Rockefeller Syndicate is
far down on the list of the world's financial structure. Why then is it of
such importance?
Although it is not the crucial factor in
financial decision in the Western Hemisphere, it is the actual working
control mechanism of the American colony. The Rockefeller family themselves,
like the Morgans, Schiffs and Warburgs, have faded into insignificance, but
the mechanism created in their name roars along at full power, still
maintaining all of he functions for which it was organized.
Since he setup
the Trilateral Commission, David Rockefeller has functioned as a sort of
international courier for the World Order, principally concerned with
delivering working instructions to the Communist bloc, either directly, in
New York or by traveling to the area.
Lawrence Rockefeller is active in the operation
of the Medical Monopoly, but his principal interests are in operating
various vacation spas in tropical areas. They are the two survivors of the
"Fortunate Five," the five sons of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and Abby
Aldrich. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. died in an institution in Tucson, Arizona
and was hastily cremated.
John D. Rockefeller III died in a mysterious
accident on a New York Parkway near his home. Nelson Rockefeller, named
after his grandfather, died in the arms of a TV journalist; it was later
revealed that he had also been in the arms of another TV journalist at the
same time; the death was hushed up for many hours. It is generally believed
hat he ran afoul of his Colombian drug connection, the disagreement hardly
being trivial; it involved several billion dollars in drug profits which had
not been properly apportioned.
Winthrop Rockefeller died an alcoholic in the
arms of his black boy friend. He had been interviewed on television by Harry Reasoner to explain his hasty move from New York to Arkansas. Winthrop
leered that his black boy friend, an Army sergeant who apparently taught him
the mysteries of drill, refused to live in New York. To celebrate this
alliance, Winthrop Rockefeller gave magnificently to Negro causes, including
the Urban League building on East 48th Street in New York.
A plaque on the second floor notes that it was
his gift; it might well have stated "From Hadrian to his Antinous".
We do not wish to imply that the Rockefellers no longer have influence, but
that the major policy dictates of the Rockefeller Syndicate are handed down
by other capos, of whom they continue to be a visible force. Through the
person of David Rockefeller, the family is sometimes called "the first
family of the Soviet Union." Only he and Dr. Armand Hammer, the moving force
behind USTEC, have permanent permission to land their private planes at the
Moscow Airport. Others would suffer the fate of KAL 007.
Both the Rockefeller family fortune and the considerable portion set aside
in the foundations of the Rockefeller Syndicate are effectively insulated
against any type of government control. Fortune magazine noted August 4,
1986, that John D. Rockefeller, Jr. had created trusts in 1934 which now
amounted to some $2.3 billion; another $200 million had been set aside for
the Abby Rockefeller branch.
The five sons had trusts which in 1986 amount to
$2.1 billion. These trusts had originally amounted to only $50 million each,
showing the increase in their assets as well as inflation during the ensuing
half century. Fortune estimated the 1986 total Rockefeller wealth as $3.5
billion, of which $900 million was in securities and real estate. They owned
45% of the Time Life Building; Nelson Rockefeller's International Basic
Economy Corporation had been sold to a British company in 1980.
For years, the Rockefeller family had
deliberately kept the rents low in its major holding, the Rockefeller
Center, a $1.6 billion investment yielding an annual return of 1%. This was
a convenient maneuver, for tax purposes. Rockefeller Center recently went
public issuing stock which was sold to public buyers. The Rockefellers are
rumored to be liquidating their investments in the New York area, and
reinvesting in the West, particularly in the area around Phoenix, Arizona.
It is possible that they know something we don't.
However much of the Rockefeller wealth may be attributed to old John D.'s
rapacity and ruthlessness, its origins are indubitably based in his initial
financing from the National City Bank of Cleveland, which was identified in
Congressional reports as one of the three Rothschild banks in the United
States and by his later acceptance of the guidance of Jacob Schiff of Kuhn,
Loeb & Company, who had been born in the Rothschild house in Frankfort and
was now the principal Rothschild representative (but unknown as such to the
public) in the United States.
With the seed money from the National City Bank of Cleveland, old John D.
Rockefeller soon laid claim to the title of "the most ruthless American". It
is more than likely that it was this quality which persuaded the Rothschilds
to back him.
Rockefeller realized early in the game that the
oil refinery business, which could offer great profits in a short time, also
was at the mercy of uncontrolled competition. His solution was a simple
one-crush all competition. The famous Rockefeller dedication to total
monopoly was simply a business decision. Rockefeller embarked on a campaign
of coercing all competing oil refineries out of business. He attacked on a
number of fronts, which is also a lesson to all would be entrepreneurs.
First, he would send a minion, not known to be
working for Rockefeller, with an offer to buy the competing refinery for a
low price, but offering cash. If the offer was refused, the competitor would
then come under attack from a competing refinery which greatly undercut his
price. He might also suffer a sudden strike at his refinery, which would
force him to shut down. Control of labor through unions has always been a
basic Rockefeller technique. Like the Soviet Union, they seldom have labor
trouble.
If these techniques failed, Rockefeller would
then be saddened by a reluctant decision to use violence; beating the rival
workers as they went to and from their jobs, or burning or blowing up the
competing refinery.
These techniques convinced the Rothschilds that they had found their man.
They sent their personal representative, Jacob Schiff, to Cleveland to help
Rockefeller plan further expansion. At this time, the Rothschilds controlled
95% of all railroad mileage in the United States, through the J.P. Morgan
Company and Kuhn Loeb & Company according to official Department of Commerce
figures for the year 1895.
J.P.Morgan mentions in his Who's Who listing
that he controlled 50,000 miles of U.S. railways. Schiff worked out an
elaborate rebate deal for Rockefeller, through a dummy corporation, South
Improvement Company. These rebates ensured that no other oil company could
survive in competition with the Rockefeller firm.
The scheme was later exposed, but by that time
Rockefeller had achieved a virtual monopoly of the oil business in the
United States. The daughter of one of his victims, Ida Tarbell, whose father
was ruined by Rockefeller's criminal operations, wrote the first major
expose of the Standard Oil Trust She was promptly denounced as a "muckraker"
by the poseur, Theodore Roosevelt, who claimed to be a "trust buster". In
fact, he ensured the dominance of the Standard Oil Trust and other giant
trusts.
During the next half century, John D. Rockefeller was routinely caricatured
by socialist propagandists as the epitome of the ruthless capitalist. At the
same time, he was the principal financier of the world Communist movement,
through a firm called American International Company Despite the fact that
the House of Rothschild had already achieved world control, the sound and
fury was directed exclusively against its two principal, representatives,
John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan.
One of the few revelations of the actual state
of affairs appeared in Truth magazine, December 16, 1912, which pointed out
that,
"Mr. Schiff is head of the great private
banking house of Kuhn, Loeb &Company, which represents the Rothschild
interests on this side of the Atlantic. He is described as a financial
strategist and has been for years the financial minister of the great
impersonal power known as Standard Oil."
Note that this editor did not even mention the
name of Rockefeller.
Because of these concealed factors, it was a relatively simple matter for
the American public to accept the "fact" that the Rockefellers were the
preeminent power in this country.
This myth was actually clothed in the
apparel of power,
-
the Rockefeller Oil Trust becoming the
"military-industrial complex" which assumed political control of the nation
-
the Rockefeller Medical Monopoly attained control of the health care of the
nation
-
the Rockefeller Foundation, a web of affiliated tax exempt
creations, effectively controlled the religious and educational life of the
nation
The myth succeeded in its goal of camouflaging
the hidden rulers,
the Rothschilds.
After the present writer had been exposing this charade for some twenty-five
years, a new myth began to be noised about in American conservative circles,
effectively propagated by active double agents. This myth found a host of
eager believers, because it heralded a growing crack in the monolithic power
which had been oppressing all the peoples of the world. This new
"revelation" was that a struggle to the death for world power had developed
between the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.
According to this startling development, one
faction or the other, depending on which agent you were listening to, had
gained control of the Soviet Union and would use its power as the basis for
achieving the overthrow of the other faction. The sudden death of several
members of the Rockefeller family was cited as "proof" that such a struggle
was taking place, although no Rothschild is known to have succumbed during
this "war".
This ignored the general understanding that
Nelson Rockefeller had been "eliminated" as the result of losing deposit
slips for several billion dollars of drugs from the Colombian cartel, or
that the other Rockefeller deaths showed no trace of a "Rothschild
connection".
Having maintained extensive files on this situation for several decades, the
present writer could not believe anyone could be so misinformed as to think
that "the Rockefellers" were now trying to seize power from the Rothschilds,
at a time when the influence of members of the Rockefeller family was
already in great decline, their family finances being handled by J.
Richardson Dilworth, their legal affairs being handled by John J. McCloy,
and other faithful retainers; none of these retainers would have been
willing to engage in a genuine power struggle, as they were faceless
managers who lived only for their weekly paycheck.
They had no ambitions of their own.
Nevertheless, many hopeful Americans grasped the will-o-the-wisp notion that
the Rockefellers were now "good Americans" who were willing to risk all to
overthrow the Rothschilds.
Amazingly enough, this pernicious story
persisted for almost a decade before being relegated to the curiosities of
history.
Like J.P. Morgan, who had begun his commercial career by selling the U.S.
Army some defective guns, the famous fall carbine affair, John D.
Rockefeller also was a war profiteer during the Civil War; he sold unstamped
Harkness liquor to Federal troops at a high profit, gaining the initial
capital to embark on his drive for monopoly. His interest in the oil
business was a natural one; his father, William Rockefeller had been "in
oil" for years.
William Rockefeller had become an oil
entrepreneur after salt wells at Tarentum, near Pittsburgh, were discovered
in 1842 to be flowing with oil. The owners of the wells, Samuel L. Kier,
began to bottle the oil and sell it for medicinal purposes. One of his
earliest wholesalers was William Rockefeller. The "medicine" was originally
labeled "Kier's Magic Oil".
Rockefeller printed his own labels, using "Rock
Oil" or "Seneca Oil," Seneca being the name of a well known Indian tribe.
Rockefeller achieved his greatest notoriety and his greatest profits by
advertising himself as "William Rockefeller, the Celebrated Cancer
Specialist".
It is understandable that his grandsons would
become the controlling power behind the scenes of the world's most famous
cancer treatment center and would direct government funds and charitable
contributions to those areas which only benefit the Medical Monopoly.
William Rockefeller spared no claim in his flamboyant career.
He guaranteed "All Cases of Cancer Cured Unless
They Are Too Far Gone."
Such were the healing powers that he attributed
to his magic cancer cure that he vas able to retail it for $25 a bottle, a
sum then equivalent to two months' wages. The "cure" consisted of a few well
known diuretics, which had been diluted by water. This carnival medicine
show barker could hardly have envisioned that his descendants would control
the greatest and the most profitable Medical Monopoly in recorded history.
As an itinerant "carnie," a traveling carnival peddler, William Rockefeller
had chosen a career which interfered with developing a stable family life.
His son John rarely saw him, a circumstance which has inspired some
psychological analysts a conjecture that the absence of a father figure or
parental love may have contributed to John D. Rockefeller's subsequent
development as a money mad tyrant who plotted to maim, poison and kill
millions of his fellow American during almost century of his monopolistic
operations and whose influence, reaching up from the grave, remains the most
dire and malignant presence in American life.
This may have been a contributing
factor-however, it is also possible that he was totally evil. It is hardly
arguable that he is probably the most Satanic figure in American history.
It has long been a truism that you can find a horse thief or two in any
prominent American family. In the Rockefeller family it was more than a
truism. William seems to have faithfully followed the precepts of the Will
of Canaan throughout his career, "love robbery, love lechery." He fled from
a number of indictments for horse stealing, finally disappearing altogether
as William Rockefeller and re-emerging as Dr. William Levingston of
Philadelphia, a name which he retained for the rest of his life.
An investigative reporter at Joseph Pulitzer's
New York World received a tip that was followed up. The World then disclosed
that William Avery Rockefeller had died May 11, 1906 in Freeport, Illinois,
where he was interred in an unmarked grave as Dr. William Levingston.
William Rockefeller's vocation as a medicine man greatly facilitated his
preferred profession of horse thief. As one who planned to be in the next
county by morning, it was a simple matter to tie a handsome stallion to the
back of his wagon and head for the open road. It also played a large part in
his vocation as a woman-chaser; he was described as being "woman-mad".
He not only concluded several bigamous
marriages, but he seems to have had uncontrolled passions. On June 28, 1849,
he was indicted for raping a hired girl in Cayuga, New York; he later was
found to be residing in Oswego, New York and was forced once again to decamp
for parts unknown. He had no difficulty in financing his woman-chasing
interests from the sale of his miraculous cancer cure and from another
product, his "Wonder Working Liniment," which he offered at only two dollars
a bottle.
It consisted of crude petroleum from which the
lighter oils had been boiled away, leaving a heavy solution of paraffin,
lube oil and tar, which comprised the "liniment." William Rockefeller's
original miracle oil survived until quite recently as a concoction called
Nujol, consisting principally of petroleum and peddled as a laxative. It was
well known that Nujol was merely an advertising sobriquet meaning "new oil,"
as opposed, apparently, to "old oil".
Sold as an antidote to constipation, it robbed
the body of fat-soluble vitamins, it being a well-established medical fact
that mineral oil coated the intestine and prevented the absorption of many
needed vitamins and other nutritional needs. Its makers added carotene as a
sop to the health-conscious, but it was hardly worth the bother. Nujol was
manufactured by a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey, called Stanco,
whose only other product, manufactured on the same premises, was the famous
insecticide, Flit.
Nujol was hawked from the Senate Office Building in Washington for years
during a more liberal interpretation of "conflict of interest." In this
case, it was hardly a conflict of interest, because the august peddler,
Senator Royal S. Copeland, never had any interests other than serving the
Rockefellers. He was a physician whom Rockefeller had appointed as head of
the New York State Department of Health and later financed his campaign for
the Senate.
Copeland's frank display of commercialism amazed
even the most blasé Washington reporters. He devoted his Senate career to a
daily program advertising Nujol. A microphone was set up in his Senate
office each morning, the first order of business being the Nujol program,
for which he was paid $75,000 a year, an enormous salary in the 1930s and
more than the salary of the President of the United States. Senator
Copeland's exploits earned him a number of nicknames on Capitol Hill.
He was often called the Senator from the
American Medical Association, because of his enthusiastic backing for any
program launched by the AMA and Morris Fishbein. More realistically, he was
usually referred to as "the Senator from Standard Oil". He could be counted
on to promote any legislation devised for the greater profit of the
Rockefeller monopoly.
During congressional debate on the Food and Drug
Act in 1938, he came under criticism from Congresswoman Leonor Sullivan, who
charged that Senator Copeland, a physician who handled the bill on the
Senate floor, frankly acknowledged during the debate that soap was exempted
from the law, because the soap manufacturers, who were the nation's largest
advertisers, would otherwise join with other big industries to fight the
bill.
Congresswoman Sullivan complained the,
"Soap was officially declared in the law not
to be a cosmetic... The hair dye manufacturers were given license to
market known dangerous products, just so long as they placed a special
warning on the label-but what woman in a beauty parlor ever sees the
label on the bulk container in which hair dye is shipped?"
Just as the elder Rockefeller had spent his life
in the pursuit of his personal obsession, omen, so his son John was equally
obsessed, being money-mad instead of women-mad, totally committed to the
pursuit of ever-increasing wealth and power.
However, the principal accomplishments of the
Rockefeller drive for power, the rebate scheme for monopoly, the chartering
of the foundations to gain power over American citizens, the creation of the
central bank, the Federal Reserve System, the backing of the World Communist
revolution and the creation of the Medical Monopoly, all came from the
Rothschilds or from their European employees. We cannot find in the records
of John D. Rockefeller that he originated any one of these programs.
The concept of the tax exempt charitable
foundation originated with the Rothschild minion, George Peabody, in 1865.
The Peabody Educational Foundation later became the Rockefeller Foundation.
It is unlikely that even the diabolical mind of John D. Rockefeller could
have conceived of this devious twist. A social historian has described the
major development of the late nineteenth century, when charitable
foundations and world Communism became important movements, as one of the
more interesting facets of history, perhaps equivalent to the discovery of
the wheel.
This new discovery was the concept developed by
the rats, who after all have rather highly developed intelligence's, that
they could trap people by baiting traps with little bits of cheese. The
history of mankind since then has been the rats catching humans in their
traps. Socialism-indeed any government program-is simply the rat baiting the
trap with a smidgen of cheese and catching himself a human.
Congressman Wright Patman, chairman of the House Banking and Currency
Committee, noted from the floor of Congress that the establishment of the
Rockefeller Foundation effectively insulated Standard Oil from competition.
The controlling stock had been removed from market manipulation or possible
buy-outs by competitors.
It also relieved Standard Oil from most
taxation, which then placed a tremendous added burden on individual American
taxpayers. Although a Rockefeller relative by marriage, Senator Nelson
Aldrich, Republican majority leader in the Senate, had pushed the General
Education Board charter through Congress, the Rockefeller Foundation charter
proved to be more difficult. Widespread criticism of Rockefeller's
monopolistic practices was heard, and his effort to insulate his profits
from taxation or takeover was seen for what it was.
The charter was finally pushed through in 1913
(the significant Masonic numeral 13-1913 was also the year the progressive
income tax and of the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act). Senator Robert
F. Wagner of New York, another senator from Standard Oil (there were quite a
few), ramrodded the Congressional approval of the charter.
The charter was then signed by:
-
John D.
Rockefeller
-
John D. Rockefeller, Jr.
-
Henry Pratt Judson, president of the
Rockefeller established University of Chicago
-
Simon Flexner, director of
the Rockefeller Institute
-
Starr Jameson, described in Who's Who as
"personal counsel to John D. Rockefeller in his benevolences"
-
Charles W
Eliot, president of Harvard University
The Rockefeller Oil Monopoly is now 125
years old, yet in 1911, the Supreme Court, bowing to public outrage, had
ruled that it had to be broken up.
The resulting companies proved to be no
problem for the Rockefeller interests. The family retained a two per cent
holding in each of the "new" companies, while the Rockefeller foundations
took a three per cent stock holding in each company. This gave them a five
per cent stock interest in each company; a one per cent holding in a corporation is usually
sufficient to maintain working control.
The involvement of the Rockefellers in promoting the world Communist
Revolution also developed from their business interests. There was never any
commitment to the Marxist ideology; like anything else, it was there to be
used. At the turn of the century Standard Oil was competing fiercely with
Royal Dutch Shell for control of the lucrative European market.
Congressional testimony revealed that
Rockefeller had sent large sums to Lenin and Trotsky to instigate the
Communist Revolution of 1905. His banker, Jacob Schiff, had previously
financed the Japanese in their war against Russia and had sent a personal
emissary, George Kennan to Russia to spend some twenty years in promoting
revolutionary activity against the Czar. When the Czar abdicated, Trotsky
was placed on a ship with three hundred Communist revolutionaries from the
Lower East Side of New York.
Rockefeller obtained a special passport for
Trotsky from Woodrow Wilson and sent Lincoln Steffens with him to make sure
he was returned safely to Russia.
For traveling expenses, Rockefeller placed a
purse containing $10,000 in Trotsky's pocket.
On April 13, 1917, when the ship stopped in Halifax, Canadian Secret Service
officers immediately arrested Trotsky and interned him in Nova Scotia. The
case became an international cause célèbre, as leading government officials
from several nations frantically demanded Trotsky's release. The Secret
Service had been tipped off that Trotsky was on his way to take Russia out
of the war, freeing more German armies to attack Canadian troops on the
Western Front.
Prime Minister Lloyd George hurriedly cabled
orders from London to the Canadian Secret Service to free Trotsky at
once--they ignored him. Trotsky was finally freed by the intervention of one
of Rockefeller's most faithful stooges, Canadian Minister Mackenzie King,
who had long been a "labor specialist" for the Rockefellers. King personally
obtained Trotsky' s release and sent him on his way as the emissary of the
Rockefellers, commissioned to win the Bolshevik Revolution.
Thus Dr. Armand Hammer, who loudly proclaims his
influence in Russia as the friend of Lenin, has an insignificant claim
compared to the role of the Rockefellers in backing world Communism.
Although Communism, like other isms, had originated with Marx's association
with the House of Rothschild, it enlisted the reverent support of John D.
Rockefeller because he saw Communism for what it is, the ultimate monopoly,
not only controlling the government, the monetary system and all property,
but also a monopoly which, like the corporations it emulates, is
self-perpetuating and eternal !; It was the logical progression from his
Standard Oil monopoly.
An important step on the road to world monopoly was the most far-reaching
corporation invented by
the Rothschilds. This was the international drug and
chemical cartel,
I.G. Farben.
Called "a state within a state," it was
created in 1925 as Interessen Gemeinschaft Farbenindustrie Aktien
gesellschaft, usually known as I.G. Farben, which simply meant "The Cartel".
It had originated in 1904, when the six major
chemical companies in Germany began negotiations to form the ultimate
cartel, merging Badische Anilin, Bayer, Agfa, Hoechst, Weiler-ter-Meer, and
Greisheim-Electron. The guiding spirit, as well as the financing, came from
the Rothschilds, who were represented by their German banker, Max Warburgs,
of M.M. Warburg Company, Hamburg. He later headed the German Secret Service
during World War I and was personal financial adviser to the Kaiser.
When the Kaiser was overthrown, after losing the
war, Max Warburg was not exiled with him to Holland, instead he became the
financial adviser to the new government. Monarchs may come and go, but the
real power remains with the bankers.
While representing Germany at the Paris Peace
Conference, Max Warburg spent pleasant hours renewing family ties with his
brother, Paul Warburg, who, after drafting the Federal Reserve Act at Jekyll
Island, had headed the U.S. banking system during the war. He was in Paris
as Woodrow Wilson's financial advisor.
I.G. Farben soon had a net worth of six billion marks, controlling some five
hundred firms. Its first president was Professor Carl Bosch. During the
period of the Weimar Republic, I.G. officials, seeing the handwriting on the
wall, began a close association with Adolf Hitler, supplying much needed
funds and political influence.
The success of the I.G. Farben cartel had
aroused the interest of other industrialists. Henry Ford was favorably
impressed and set up a German branch of Ford Motor Company. Forty per cent
of the stock was purchased by I.G. Farben. I.G. Farben then established an
American subsidiary, called American I.G., in cooperation with Standard Oil
of New Jersey. Its directors included Walter Teagle, president of Standard
Oil, Paul Warburg of Kuhn Loeb & Company and Edsel Ford, representing the
Ford interests.
John Foster Dulles, for the law firm, Sullivan
and Cromwell, became the attorney for I.G., frequently traveling between New
York and Berlin on cartel business. His law partner, Arthur Dean, is now
director of the $40 million Teagle Foundation which was set up before
Teagle's death. Like other fortunes it had become part of the network.
Like John Foster Dulles, Arthur Dean has been a
director of American Banknote for many years; this is the firm which
supplies the paper for our dollar bills. Dean also has been an active behind
the scenes government negotiator, serving as arms negotiator at disarmament
conferences. Dean was also a director of Rockefeller's American Ag & Chem
Company.
He was a director of American Solvay, American Metal and other
firms. As attorney for the wealthy Hochschild family, who owned Climax
Molybdenum and American Metal, Dean became director of their family
foundation, the Hochschild Foundation.
Dean is director emeritus of the Council on
Foreign Relations, the Asia Foundation, International House, Carnegie
Foundation, and the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
In 1930, Standard Oil announced that it had purchased an alcohol monopoly in
Germany, a deal which had been set up by I.G. Farben. After Hitler came to
power, John D. Rockefeller assigned his personal press agent, Ivy ! Lee, to
Hitler to serve as a full-time adviser on the rearmament of Germany, a
necessary step for setting up World War II.
Standard Oil then built large refineries in
Germany for the Nazis and continued to supply them with oil during World War
II. In the 1930s Standard Oil was receiving in payment from Germany large
shipments of musical instruments and ships which had been built in German
yards.
The dreaded Gestapo, the Nazi police force, was actually built from the
worldwide intelligence network which I.G. Farben had maintained since its
inception. Herman Schmitz, who had succeeded Carl Bosch as head of I.G., has
been personal advisor to chancellor Brüning; when Hitler took over, Schmitz
then became his most trusted secret counselor.
So well concealed was the association that the
press had orders never to photograph them together. Schmitz was named an
honorary member of the Reichstag, while his assistant, Carl Krauch, became
Göring's principal advisor in carrying out the Nazis' Four Year Plan.
A business associate, Richard Krebs, later
testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee,
"The I.G. Farbenindustrie, I know from
personal experience, was already, in 1934, completely in the hands of
the Gestapo."
This was a misstatement; the
I.G. Farben had
merely allied itself with the Gestapo.
In 1924 Krupp Industries was in serious financial difficulty.
-
The firm was
saved by a $10 million cash loan from Hallgarten & Company and Goldman
Sachs, two of Wall Street's best known firms.
-
The planned re-armament of
Germany was able to proceed only after Dillon Read floated $100 million of
German bonds on Wall Street for that purposes;
-
It was hardly surprising
that at the conclusion of the Second World War, General William Draper was
appointed Economic Czar of Germany, being named head of the Economic
Division of the Allied Military Government. He was a partner of Dillon Read.
In 1939 Frank Howard, a vice-president of Standard Oil visited Germany.
He
later testified,
"We did our best to work out complete plans for a
modus vivendi which would operate throughout the term of the war, whether we came
in or not."
At this time American I.G. had on its board of directors Charles
Mitchell, president of the National City Bank, the Rockefeller bank, Carl
Bosch, Paul Warburg, Herman Schmitz and Schmitz' nephew, Max Ilgner.
Although his name is hardly known, Frank Howard was for many years a key
figure in Standard Oil operations as director of its research and its
international agreements. He also was chairman of the research committee at
Sloan Kettering Institute during the 1930s; his appointee at Sloan
Kettering, Dusty Rhoads, headed the experimentation in the development of
chemotherapy. During the Second World War Rhoads headed the Chemical Warfare
Service in Washington at U.S. Army Headquarters.
It was Frank Howard who had persuaded both
Alfred Sloan and Charles Kettering of General Motors in 1939 to give their
fortunes to the Cancer Center, which then took on their names. A member of
the wealthy Atherton family, Frank Howard (1891-1964) had married a second
time, his second wife being a leading member of the British aristocracy, the
Duchess of Leeds.
The first Duke of Leeds was titled in 1694, Sir
Thomas Osborne, who was one of the key conspirators in the overthrow of King
James II and the seizure of the throne of England by William III in
1688s; Osborne had made peace with Holland during the reign of King
Charles II, and single-handedly promoted the marriage of Mary, daughter of
the Duke of York, to William of Orange in 1677.
The Dictionary of National Biography notes that
Osborne,
"for five years managed the House of Commons
by corruption and enriched himself."
He was impeached by King Charles II for
treasonous negotiations with King Louis XIV and imprisoned in the Tower of
London from 1678 to 1684.
After his release, he again became active in the
conspiracy to bring in William of Orange as King of England and secured the
crucial province of York for him. William then created him Duke of Leeds.
The placing of William on the throne of England made it possible for the
conspirators to implement the crucial step in their plans, setting up the
Bank of England in 1694. This enabled the Amsterdam bankers to gain control
of the wealth of the British Empire.
Osborne's biography also notes that he was later
accused of Jacobite intrigues and was impeached for receiving a large bribe
to procure the charter for the East India Company in 1695, but "the
proceedings were not concluded". It was further noted that he "left a large
fortune".
The 11th Duke of Leeds was Minister to Washington from 1931 to 1935,
Minister to the Holy See from 1936 to 1947, that is, throughout the Second
World War.
One branch of the family married into the Delano family, becoming
relatives of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. A cousin, Viscount Chandos, was a
prominent British official, serving in the War Cabinet under Churchill from
1942 to 1945, later becoming a director of the Rothschild firm, Alliance
Assurance, and Imperial Chemical Industries.
-
Frank Howard was the key official in maintaining relations between Standard
Oil and I.G. Farben. He led in the development of synthetic rubber, which
was crucial to Germany in the Second World War; he later wrote a book, "Buna
Rubber". He also was the consultant to the drug firm, Rohm and Haas,
representing the Rockefeller connection with that firm. In his later years,
he resided in Paris, but continued to maintain his office at 30 Rockefeller
Center, New York.
-
Walter Teagle, the president of Standard Oil, owned 500,000 shares of
American I.G., these shares later becoming the basis of the Teagle
Foundation.
-
Herman Metz, who was also a director of American I.G., was
president of H.A. Metz Company, New York, a drug firm wholly owned by I.G
Farben of Germany.
-
Francis Garvan, who had served as Alien Property
Custodian during the First World War, knew many secrets of I.G. Farben's
operations. He was prosecuted in 1929 to force him to remain
silent. The action was brought by the Department of Justice through Attorney
General Merton Lewis, the former counsel for Bosch Company.
-
John Krim, former counsel for the German Embassy
in the United States, testified that Senator John King had been on the
payroll of the Hamburg American Line for three years at a salary of fifteen
thousand dollars a year; he appointed Otto Kahn as treasurer of his election
fund;
-
Homer Cummings, who had been Attorney General for six years, then
became counsel for General Aniline and Film at a salary of $100,000 a year.
During the Second World War, GAF was supposedly owned by a Swiss firm; it
came under considerable suspicion as an "enemy" concern and was finally
taken over by the United States government.
-
John Foster Dulles had been
director of GAF from 1927 to 1934; he was also a director of International
Nickel, which was part of the network of I.G Farben firms. Dulles was related to the Rockefeller family
through the Avery connection. He was attorney for the organization of a new
investment firm, set up by Avery Rockefeller, in 1936 which was called
Schröder-Rockefeller Company. It combined operations of the Schröder Bank,
Hitler's personal bank and the Rockefeller interests.
-
Baron Kurt von Schröder was one of Hitler's closest confidantes, and a leading officer of
the SS. He was head of the Keppler Associates, which funneled money to the
SS for leading German Corporations. Keppler was the official in charge of
Industrial Fats during Göring's Four Year Plan, which was launched in 1936.
American I.G. changed its name to General
Aniline and Film during the Second World War, but it was still wholly owned
by I.G. Chemie of Switzerland, a subsidiary of I.G. Farben of Germany.
It
was headed by Gadow, brother-in-law of Herman Schmitz. I.G. Farben's
international agreements directly affected the U.S. war effort, because they
set limits on U.S. supplies of magnesium, synthetic rubber and, crucial
medical supplies.
The director of I.G. Farben's dyestuffs
division, Baron George von Schnitzler, was related to the powerful von Rath
family, the J.H. Stein Bankhaus which held Hitler's account and the von
Mallinckrodt family, the founders of the drug firm in the United States.
Like other I.G. officials, he had become an enthusiastic supporter of the
Hitler regime. I.G. Farben gave four and a half million reichsmarks to the
Nazi Party in 1933; by 1945, I.G. had given the Party 40 million reichsmarks,
a sum which equaled all contributions by I.G. to all other recipients during
that period. One scholar of the Nazi era, Anthony Sutton, has focused
heavily on German supporters of Hitler, while ignoring the crucial role
played by the Bank of England and its Governor, Sir Montague Norman, in
financing the Nazi regime.; Sutton's position on this problem may have been
influenced by the fact that he is British.
In view of the outspoken statements from Adolf
Hitler about Jewish influence in Germany, it would be difficult to explain
the role of
I.G. Farben in the Nazi era. Peter Hayes' definitive study of
I.G. Farben shows that in 1933 it had ten Jews on its governing boards. We
have previously pointed out that I.G., from its inception was a Rothschild
concern, formulated by the House of Rothschild and implemented through its
agents, Max Warburg in Germany and Standard Oil in the United States.
Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands joined the SS during the early 1930s.
He
then joined the board of an I.G. subsidiary, Farben Bilder, from which he
took the name of his postwar super-secret policy making group,
the Bilderbergers. Farben executives played an important role in organizing the
Circle of Friends for Heinrich Himmler, although it was initially known as
Keppler's Circle of Friends, Keppler being the chairman of an I.G.
subsidiary.
His nephew, Fritz J. Kranefuss, was the personal
assistant to Heinrich Himmler. Of the forty members of the Circle of
Friends, which provided ample funds for Himmler, eight were executives of I.G. Farben or of its subsidiaries.
Despite the incredible devastation of most German cities from World War II
air bombings, the I.G. Farben building in Frankfort, one of the largest
buildings there, miraculously survived intact. A large Rockefeller mansion
in Frankfort also was left untouched by the war, despite the saturation
bombing. Frankfort was the birthplace of the Rothschild family.
It was hardly coincidental that the postwar
government of Germany, Allied Military Government, should set up its offices
in the magnificent I.G. Farben building. This government was headed by
General Lucius Clay, who later became a partner of Lehman Brothers bankers
in New York. The Political Division was headed by Robert Murphy, who would
preside at the Nüremberg Trials, where he was successful in glossing over
the implication of I.G. Farben officials and Baron Kurt von Schröder.
Schröder was held a short time in a detention
camp and then set free to return to his banking business. The Economic
Division was headed by Lewis Douglas, son of the founder of Memorial Cancer
center in New York, president of Mutual Life and director of General Motors.
Douglas was slated to become U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, but he
agreed to step aside in favor of his brother-in-law, John J. McCloy.
By an interesting circumstance, Douglas, McCloy
and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of Germany had all married sisters, the
daughters of John Zinsser, a partner of J.P. Morgan Company.
As the world's pre-eminent cartel, I.G. Farben and the drug companies which
it controlled in the United States through the Rockefeller interests were
responsible for many inexplicable developments in the production and
distribution of drugs. From 1908 to 1936 I.G. held back its discovery of
sulfanilamide, which would become a potent weapon in the medical arsenal. In
1920, I.G. had signed working agreements with the important drug firms of
Switzerland, Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy.
In 1926, I.G. merged with Dynamit-Nobel, the
German branch of the dynamite firm, while an English firm took over the
English division. I.G. officials then began to negotiate with Standard Oil
officials about the prospective manufacture of synthetic coal, which would
present a serious threat to Standard Oil's monopoly. A compromise was
reached with the establishment of American I.G., in which both firms would
play an active role and share in the profits.
Charles Higham's book, "Trading with the Enemy," offers ample documentation
of the Rockefeller activities during the Second World War.
While Hitler's bombers were dropping tons of
explosives on London, they were paying royalties on every gallon of gasoline
they burned to Standard Oil, under existing patent agreements. After World
War II, when Queen Elizabeth visited the United States, she stayed in only
one private home during her visit, the Kentucky estate of William Irish, of
Standard Oil. Nelson Rockefeller moved to Washington after our involvement
in World War II, where Roosevelt named him Coordinator of Inter-American
Affairs.
Apparently his principal task was to coordinate
the refueling of German ships in South America from Standard Oil tanks.
He
also used this office to obtain important South American concessions for his
private firm, International Basic Economy Corporation, including a corner on
the Colombian coffee market. He promptly upped the price, a move which
enabled him to buy seven billion dollars worth of real estate in South
America and also gave rise to the stereotype of the "Yanqui imperialismo".
The attack on Vice President Nixon's automobile
when he visited South America was explained by American officials as a
direct result of the depredations of the Rockefellers, which caused
widespread agitation against Americans in Latin America.
After World War II, twenty-four German executives were prosecuted by the
victors, all of them connected with I.G. Farben, including eleven officers
of I.G. Eight were acquitted, including Max Ilgner, nephew of Herman
Schmitz. Schmitz received the most severe sentence, eighty years. Ilgner
actually received three years, but the time was credited against his time in
jail waiting for trial, and he was immediately released. The Judge was C.G.
Shake and the prosecuting attorney was Al Minskoff.
The survival of
I.G. Farben was headlined by the Wall Street Journal on May
3, 1988-GERMANY BEATS WORLD IN CHEMICAL SALES Reporter Thomas F. O'Boyle
listed the world's top five chemical companies in 1987 as:
-
BASF $25.8 billion dollars
-
Bayer $23.6 billion dollars
-
Hoechst $23.5 billion dollars
-
ICI $20 billion dollars
-
DuPont $17 billion dollars in chemical
sales only
The first three companies are the firms
resulting from the "dismantling" of I.G. Farben from 1945 to 1952 by the
Allied Military Government, in a process suspiciously similar to the
"dismantling" of the Standard Oil empire by court edict in 1911.
The total
sales computed in dollars of the three spin-offs of I.G. Farben, some $72
billion, dwarfs its nearest rivals, ICI and DuPont, who together amount to
about half of the Farben empire's dollar sales in 1987. Hoechst bought
Celanese corp. in 1987 for $2.72 billion.
O'Boyle notes that,
"The Big Three (Farben spin-offs) still behave like a
cartel. Each dominates specific areas; head to head competition is limited.
Critics suspect collusion. At the least, there's a coziness that doesn't
exist in the U.S. chemical industry."
After the war, Americans were told they must support an "altruistic" plan to
rebuild devastated Europe, to be called the Marshall Plan, after Chief of
Staff George Marshall, who had been labeled on the floor of the Senate by
Senator Joseph McCarthy as "a living lie".
The Marshall Plan proved to be
merely another Rockefeller Plan to loot the American taxpayer.
On December 13, 1948, Col. Robert McCormick,
editor of the Chicago Tribune, personally denounced Esso's looting of the
Marshall Plan in a signed editorial.
The Marshall Plan had been rushed through
Congress by a powerful and vocal group, headed by Winthrop Aldrich,
president of the Chase Manhattan Bank and Nelson Rockefeller's
brother-in-law, ably seconded by Nelson Rockefeller and William Clayton, the
head of Anderson, Clayton Company. The Marshall Plan proved to be but one of
a number of lucrative postwar swindles, which included the Bretton Woods
Agreement, United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation and others.
After World War II, the Rockefellers used their war profits to buy a large
share of Union Miniere du Haut Katanga, an African copper lode owned by
Belgian interest, including the Societe Generale, a Jesuit controlled bank.
Soon after their investment, the Rockefellers launched a bold attempt to
seize total control of the mines through sponsoring a local revolution,
using as their agent the Grangesberg operation.
This enterprise had originally been developed by
Sir Ernest Cassel, financial advisor to King Edward VII-Cassel's daughter
later married Lord Mountbatten, a member of the British royal family, who
was also related to the Rothschilds. Grangesberg was now headed by Bo
Hammarskjold, whose brother, Dag Hammarskjold was then Secretary General of
the United Nations-Bo Hammarskjold became a casualty of the Rockefeller
revolution when his plane was shot down during hostilities in the Congo.;
Various stories have since circulated about who killed him and why he was
killed.
The Rockefeller intervention in the Congo was
carried out by their able lieutenants, Dean Rusk and George Ball of the
State Department and by Fowler Hamilton.
In the United States, the Rockefeller interests continue to play the major
political role. Old John D. Rockefeller's treasurer at Standard Oil, Charles
Pratt, bequeathed his New York mansion to the Council on Foreign Relations
as its world headquarters. His grandson, George Pratt Shultz, is now
Secretary of State.
The Rockefellers also wielded a crucial role through
their financing of the Trotskyite Communist group in the United States, the
League for Industrial Democracy, whose directors include such staunch
"anti-Communists" as Jeane Kirkpatrick and Sidney Hook.
The Rockefellers were also active on the
"right-wing" front through their sponsorship of the John Birch Society.
To
enable Robert Welch, a 32nd degree Mason, to devote all of his time to the
John Birch Society, Nelson Rockefeller purchased his family firm, the Welch
Candy Company, from him at a handsome prices; Welch chose the principal
officers of the John Birch Society from his acquaintances at the
Council On
Foreign Relations.
For years afterwards, American patriots were
puzzled by the consistent inability of the John Birch Society to move
forward on any of its well-advertised "anti-Communist" goals.
The fact that
the society had been setup at the behest of the backers of the world
Communist revolution may have played some role in this development. Other
patriots wondered why most American conservative writers, including the
present writer, were steadily blacklisted by the John Birch Society for some
thirty years.
Despite thousands of requests from would be book
buyers, the John Birch Society refused to review or list any of my books.
After several decades of futility, the Society
was totally discredited by its own record. In a desperate effort to restore
its image, William Buckley, the CIA propagandist, launched a "fierce" attack
against the John Birch Society in the pages of his magazine, the National
Review. This free publicity campaign also did little to revive the
moribund organization.
The Rockefeller monopoly influence has had its effect on some of New York's
largest and wealthiest churches. Trinity Church on Wall Street, whose
financial resources had been directed by none other than J.P. Morgan, owns
some forty commercial properties in Manhattan and has a stock portfolio of
$50 million, which, due to informed investment, actually yields a return of
$25 million a year! Only $2.6 million of this income is spent for charitable
work.
The rector, why receives a salary of $100,000 a
year, lives on the fashionable Upper East Side.
Trinity's mausoleum sells
its spaces at fees starting at $1250 and rising to $20,000. St. Bartholomew,
on Fifth Avenue, has an annual budget of $3.2 million a year of which only
$100,000 is spent on charitys; Its rector resides in a thirteen room
apartment on Park Avenue.
In medicine, the Rockefeller influence remains entrenched in its Medical
Monopoly. We have mentioned its control of the cancer industry through the
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. We have listed the directors of the major
drug firms, each with its director from Chase Manhattan Bank, the Standard
Oil Company or other Rockefeller firms. The American College of Surgeons
maintains a monopolistic control of hospitals through the powerful Hospital
Survey Committee, with members Winthrop Aldrich and David McAlpine Pyle
representing the Rockefeller control.
A medical fraternity known as the "rich man's club," the New York Academy of
Medicine, was offered grants for a new building by the Rockefeller
Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, its subsidiary group. This "seed
money" was then used to finance a public campaign which brought in funds to
erect a new building.
For Director of the new facility, the
Rockefellers chose Dr. Lindsly Williams, son-in-law of the managing partner
of Kidder, Peabody, a firm strongly affiliated with the J.P. Morgan
interests (the J.P. Morgan Company had originally been called the Peabody
Company). Williams was married to Grace Kidder Ford. Although Dr. Williams
was widely known to be an incompetent physician, his family connections were
impeccable.
He became a factor in Franklin D. Roosevelt's election campaign
when he publicly certified that Roosevelt, a cripple in a wheelchair who
suffered from a number of oppressive ailments, was both physically and
mentally fit to be the President of United States.
Dr. Williams' opinion, published in an article
in the widely circulated Collier's Magazine, allayed public doubts about
Roosevelt's condition. As a result, Williams was to be offered a newly
created post in Roosevelt's cabinet, Secretary of Health. However, it was
another thirty years before Health became a cabinet post, due to the
politicking of Oscar Ewing.
The Rockefellers had greatly extended their business interests in their
impoverished Southern states by establishing the Rockefeller Sanitary
Commission. It was headed by Dr. Wickliffe Rose, a longtime Rockefeller
henchman whose name appears on the original charter of the Rockefeller
Foundation. Despite its philanthropic goals, the Rockefeller Sanitary
Commission required financial contributions from each of the eleven Southern
states in which it operated, resulting in the creation of State Departments
of Health in those states and opening up important new spheres of influence
for their Drug Trust.
In Tennessee, the Rockefeller representative was
a Dr. Olin West, who moved on to Chicago to become the power behind the
scenes at the American Medical Association for forty years, as secretary and
general manager.
The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research finally dropped the "Medical
Research" part of its title; its president, Dr. Detlev Bronk, resided in a
$600,000 mansion furnished by this charitable operation. Rockefeller's
general Education Board has spent more than $100 million to gain control of
the nation's medical schools and turn our physicians to physician! s of the
allopathic school, dedicated to surgery and the heavy use of drugs. The
Board, which had developed from the original Peabody Foundation, also spent
some $66 million for Negro education.
One of the most far-reaching consequences of the General Education Board's
political philosophy was achieved with a mere six million dollar grant to
Columbia University in 1917, to set up the "progressive" Lincoln School.
From this school descended the national network
of progressive educators and social scientists, whose pernicious influence
closely paralleled the goals of the Communist Party, another favorite
recipient of the Rockefeller millions. From its outset, the Lincoln School
was described frankly as a revolutionary school for the primary and
secondary schools of the entire United States. It immediately discarded all
theories of education which were based on formal and well-established
disciplines, that is, the McGuffey Reader type of education which worked by
teaching such subjects as Latin and algebra, thus teaching children to think
logically about problems.
Rockefeller biographer Jules Abel hails the
Lincoln School as "a beacon light in progressive education ".
Rockefeller Institute financial fellowships produced many prominent workers
in our atomic programs, such as J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was later removed
from government laboratories as a suspected Soviet agents; Although
most of his friends and associates were known Soviet agents, this was called
"guilt by association." The Rockefeller Foundation created a number of
spin-off groups, which now plague the nation with a host of ills, one of
them being the Social Science Research Council, which single-handedly
spawned the nationwide "poverty industry," a business which expends some
$130 billion a year of taxpayer funds while grossing some $6 billion income
for its practitioners.
The money, which would amply feed and house all
of the nation's "poor," is dissipated through a vast administrative network
which awards generous concessions to a host of parasitic "consultants".
Despite years of research, the present writer has been able to merely
scratch the surface of the Rockefeller influences listed here. For instance,
the huge Burroughs Wellcome drug firm is wholly owned by the "charitable"
Wellcome Trust. This trust is directed by Lord Oliver Franks, a key member
of the London Connection which maintains the United States as a British
Colony.
Franks was Ambassador to the United States from
1948 to 1952. He is now a director of the Rockefeller Foundation, as its
principal representative in England. He also is a director of the Schröder
Bank, which handled Hitler's personal bank account, director of the Rhodes
Trust in charge of approving Rhodes scholarships, visiting professor at
the University of Chicago and chairman of Lloyd's Bank, one of England's Big
Five.
Other Rockefeller Foundation spin-offs include:
-
the influential Washington
think-tank, the Brookings Institution,
-
the National Bureau of Economic
Research, whose findings play a critical role in manipulating the stock
market
-
the Public Administration Clearing House, which indoctrinates the
nation's municipal employees
-
the Council of State Governments, which
controls the nation's state legislatures
-
the Institute of Pacific
Relations, the most notorious Communist front in the United States
The
Rockefellers appeared as directors of this group, funneling money to it
through their financial advisor, Lewis Lichtenstein Strauss, of Kuhn, Loeb
Company.
The Rockefellers have maintained their controlling interest in the Chase
Manhattan Bank, owning five per cent of the stock. Through this one asset
they control $42.5 billion worth of assets. Chase Manhattan interlocks
closely with the Big Four insurance companies, of which three, Metropolitan,
Equitable and New York Life had $113 billion in assets in 1969.
With the advent of the Reagan Administration in 1980, the Rockefeller
interests sought to obscure their longtime support of world Communism by
bringing to Washington a vocally "anti-Communist" administration. Reagan was
soon wining and dining Soviet premiers as enthusiastically as had his
predecessor Jimmy Carter.
The Reagan campaign had been managed by two
officials of Bechtel Corporation, its president, George Pratt Schultz, a
Standard Oil heir, and his counsel, Casper Weinberger. Shultz was named
Secretary of State, Weinberger, Secretary of Defense, Bechtel had been
financed by the Schröder-Rockefeller Company, the 1936 alliance between the
Schröder Bank and the Rockefeller heirs.
The Rockefeller influence also remains preeminent in the monetary field.
Since November, 1910, when Senator Nelson Aldrich chaired the secret
conference at Jekyll Island which gave us the Federal Reserve Act, the
Rockefellers have kept us within the sphere of the London Connection During
the Carter Administration, David Rockefeller generously sent his personal
assistant, Paul Volcker, to Washington to head the Federal Reserve Board.
Reagan finally replaced him in 1987 with Alan
Greenspan, a partner of J.P. Morgan Company. Their influence on our banking
system has remained constant through many financial coups on their part, one
of the most profitable being the confiscation of privately owned gold from
American citizens by Roosevelt's edict. Our citizens had to turn over their
gold to the privately owned
Federal Reserve System. The Constitution permits
confiscation for purposes of eminent domain, but prohibits confiscation for
private gain.
The gold's new owners then had the gold revalued
from $20 an ounce to $35, giving them an enormous profit.
In reviewing the all-pervasive influence of the Rockefellers and their
foreign controllers, the Rothschilds, in every aspect of American life, the
citizen must ask himself, "What can be done?"
Right can prevail only when the citizen actively
seeks justice. Justice can prevail only when each citizen realizes that it
is his God-given duty to mete out justice. History has documented all of the
crimes of the usurpers of our Constitution. We have learned the painful
lesson that the Rockefeller monopolists exercise their evil power almost
solely through federal and state agents.
At this writing, former Congressman Ron Paul is
running for the Presidency of the United States on an eminently sensible and
practical campaign:
It has been
known for years that 90% of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, ostensibly
set up to "fight crime" has been to harass and isolate political dissidents.
The criminal syndicalists are now looting the American nation of one
trillion dollars each year, of which about one-third, more than three
hundred billion dollars per year, represents the profitable depredations of
the Drug Trust and its medical subsidiaries. Before a sustained effort to
combat these depredations can be mounted, Americans must make every effort
to regain their health.
As Ezra Pound demanded in one of his famous
radio broadcasts, "Health, dammit!" America became the greatest and most
productive nation in the world because we had the healthiest citizens in the
world. When the Rockefeller Syndicate began its takeover of our medical
profession in 1910, our citizens went into a sharp decline.
Today, we suffer from a host of debilitating
ailments, both mental and physical, nearly all of which can be traced
directly to the operations of the chemical and drug monopoly and which pose
the greatest threat to our continued existence as a nation.
Unite now to restore our national
health-the result will be the restoration of our national pride, the
resumption of our role as the inventors and producers of the modern world,
and the custodian of the world's hopes and dreams of liberty and freedom.
