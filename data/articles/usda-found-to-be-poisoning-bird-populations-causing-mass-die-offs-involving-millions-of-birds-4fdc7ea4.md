Not all the mysterious bird die-offs that have been witnessed around the globe recently are due to unexplained causes.
A recent mass die-off event witnessed in Yankton, South Dakota was traced back to the USDA which admitted to carrying out a mass poisoning of the birds. After hundreds of starlings were found dead in the Yankton Riverside Park, concerned citizens began to investigate.
Before long, a USDA official called the local police and admitted they had poisoned the birds.
"They say that they had poisoned the birds about ten miles south of Yankton and they were surprised they came to Yankton like they did and died in our park," says Yankton Animal Control Officer Lisa Brasel, as reported by KTIV. (http://www.ktiv.com/Global/story.asp?S=13865540)

The USDA then confirmed the story and explained it was all "part of a large killing" in Nebraska. Some of the birds that ate the poison apparently flew all the way to Yankton before succumbing to the poison. Watch the below video.
USDA mass-murders birds on a regular basis
So why was the USDA poisoning birds in the first place?
A Nebraska farmer was apparently complaining that the starlings were defecating in his feed meal. The answer to this conundrum apparently isn't to cover your feed meal but rather call the USDA and ask them to poison thousands of birds. The USDA complied, apparently agreeing this was a brilliant idea. So they put out a poison called DRC-1339 and allowed thousands of birds to feed on that poison. Carol Bannerman from USDA Wildlife Services ridiculously claimed the bird kill was also to protect "human health."
"We're doing it to address, in this case, agricultural damage as well as the potential for human health and safety issues," she said.
That's just a lie, of course.
In what universe do starlings pose a threat to human health and safety? The USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) Wildlife Services website, by the way, is http://www.aphis.usda.gov The USDA even has a name for this mass poisoning program: Bye Bye Blackbird. Through the use of poisons such as DRC-1339, the USDA has killed more than four million birds over the last several years, reports Truthout. They even proudly publish an online spreadsheet showing just how many they've murdered with poison. Remember, these are mass bird killings that are funded with your tax dollars. It all makes you wonder whether the government is, in fact, responsible for many of the other mysterious animal deaths that have been reported across the country (and around the globe). It also makes you wonder:
If the federal government thinks nothing of murdering 4 million living, breathing birds, then what else might they be capable of doing out of a total lack of respect for wildlife? And if the USDA poisons birds because certain groups become too populous, what do you suppose is planned for when human population grows too large?
