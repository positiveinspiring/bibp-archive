with Surveillance

Recently, an
installment of
WikiLeaks' Vault7 documents
came to light
that exposed two CIA malware programs that
specifically infect Microsoft computers with the
purpose of carrying out tasks on infected
computers, checking for scheduled events, and
collecting data.
The revelation put
Microsoft in the hot seat, with people
speculating that the tech giant may have been
aware that the CIA works with features
specifically built into Microsoft computers to
collect data and perform tasks.
Microsoft's
history would suggest the worst, from
Edward
Snowden's 2013 leaks that revealed
Microsoft had,
"collaborated
closely with US intelligence services to
allow users' communications to be
intercepted, including helping the National
Security Agency to circumvent the company's
own encryption,"
...to
the NSA bragging about their newly acquired
ability to triple the amount of Skype video
calls being collected through Prism just nine months after Microsoft bought Skype.
Microsoft's CEO
had an intriguing and controversial response to
the new WikiLeaks documents.
At the company's
2017 Build conference, Microsoft CEO Satya
Nadella warned the technology industry
against creating a dystopian future,
which authors including George Orwell and
Aldous Huxley have predicted in the past.
