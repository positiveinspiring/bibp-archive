Reports from Philippino tribes-people and the
White Dragon Society members indicate a major military stand-off is taking
place in the South China Sea and the Philippines over control of historical
gold deposits in the region.
A fleet of 8 US war-ships is being confronted by
a joint Chinese/Russian fleet in the region. The Chinese have publicly
announced they are willing to go to war over this dispute. The US warships
are linked to a mysterious Hong Kong based individual by the name of
Rosenberg (first name not known), the CIA sources say.
Rosenberg is believed to be seeking physical
gold to seize on behalf of the Nazi/Sabbatean cabalist owners of the Federal
Reserve Board, these sources say. In the Chinese government and Western
corporate propaganda news this dispute is described as being a Chinese
Philippine dispute over an area, blocked out on Google Earth, known as the
Scarborough Shoal by the West and the Huangyan Islands by China.
This dispute is linked to the failed IMF and World Bank meetings that took
place in Washington D.C. last week. It is also linked to an ongoing power
struggle between the three factions in China, multiple sources say.
The US, or should we say, Nazi (national socialist Zionist) forces have been
systematically searching bunkers and caves in the Philippines even as they
look for sunken gold ships around the Huangyan Islands and in other areas,
the sources say.
This is what an ASEAN White Dragon Society ally had to say to
Neil Keenan on the subject:
Hello Neil.
In PALAWAN, those that are LOCALs are now
terrified, letters have gone to us all last week
Re - so CALLED
wardens (accredited officers) who are US army scouts going round to
do a census on all local residents and buildings, saying its for our
own protection
this has never happened before, they are with
sophisticated equipment
loading huge cargo like hanger CONTAINERs, all
of army material !!!!!! they already have taken on 6 islands and are now
off to JOLO ( SULU islands) due to IMF and Rebel tribe bandits.
There is definitely a WAR going to happen but what we are told is the
ARMIES in/on the islands are for FUEL bases, ???? some of these ships
are with FUEL/ something going on Neil it is same in Indonesia.
These reports come as Chinese and Russian fleets converge on the area
for exercises that coincided with US announcements of joint
Philippine/US maneuver in the same region.
Here is a US
government propaganda report.
Here is what the Chinese foreign minister had to say on the subject during
an April 16th press conference:
Q: The Philippine Foreign Ministry
reportedly said that a Philippine ship conducting archaeological studies
in waters off the Huangyan Island was harassed by the Chinese side. How
do you respond to that?
A: Currently the situation over the Huangyan Island has been eased
thanks to the efforts made, and China and the Philippines are making
further communication through diplomatic channels. According to relevant
international conventions and Chinese laws, no organization or
individual shall conduct such activities without the permission of the
Chinese Government. China demands this archaeological ship to leave the
waters off the Huangyan Island immediately.
The archaeological ship, has so far failed to
locate the gold deposits it arrived to search for, CIA sources say.
In any case, this battle by the cabalists to
steal gold is actually a sign of desperation after their failure, despite
multiple attempts, to gain legal rights to the 85% of humanitys gold held
by Asians.
This gold grab is seen by many as last minute
looting by cabal members hoping they will still be able to control the world
with gold even as their fiat financial rule collapses. That is not going to
happen.
This brings us to last weeks IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington. The
Western propaganda media reports a victory by the IMF because it was able
to get $430 billion worth of funding for Europe. Japans slave government,
for example, handed over $60 billion in cabal money originally earmarked for
post-tsunami reconstruction.
However, a look at the fine print reveals
the BRICs nations have made their funding
conditional on reform of IMF voting rights. As Brazils Finance Minister
pointed out, at present the UK, which has a smaller economy than Brazil, has
twice the IMF voting rights as Brazil.
The European nations are willing to increase BRICs voting shares in the IMF
but the US is blocking it because it would then have to give up control of
the World Bank. Certainly the European bond markets were not fooled by the
announcements coming out of this meeting because Spanish bond yields
actually rose after it.
In any case, both
the IMF and
the World Bank are increasingly irrelevant.
Think about it for a minute, the IMF, the so-called lender of last resort in
the post war era, the group that once bailed out Russia, is running around
with a begging bowl make it obvious to all this institution is no longer at
the top of the international financial food chain.
The World Bank, for its part, lent out only $42 billion in new money in
2011, compared to a world GDP of roughly $75 trillion. They are a puny
organization.
By contrast, the White Dragon Society is proposing the creation of a Long
Term Infrastructure for Everybody (LIFE) planning agency with initial
funding of $800 trillion. Of course at this level, numbers are meaningless.
The current rules allow the Japanese to leverage their $8 trillion in hard
foreign exchange assets 100 times, meaning 800 trillion dollars or over
$100,000 each for every man woman and child on earth (as a Japanese reader
pointed out, I miscalculated in previous reports by saying that was
available on 10 times leverage).
Even if you take the more conservative
Basel 3 rules with over 10 times
leverage, Japan can still legally make $10,000 available for every human,
still plenty enough to end poverty and stop environmental destruction.
If this money is delivered in the form of things that really exist, such as
roads, schools, nature preserves, consumer products etc., then there is no
limit to how much new money is created other than reality.
Needless to say China, ASEAN, Brazil, Russia etc. can all make similar moves
in harmony and parallel with Japanese efforts.
The cabalists, for their part, have been making a desperate push to ensure
their survival.
They have blocked all efforts to create new
organizations such as LIFE within the existing US dollar and Euro based
systems even as they refuse fundamental reform of their organizations such
as,
They also made a big push in China to convince
leaders like Hu Jintao the White Dragon Society is a neo-colonialist
organization controlled by the Rothschild family.
The WDS has no Rothschild family members in its
ranks and does not receive a penny from
the Rothschilds or other cabal families
like
the Rockefellers and
Bushes.
It is dedicated to ending their terrorist
misrule of the planet.
