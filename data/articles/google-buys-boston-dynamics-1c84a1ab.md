Google helps out the NSA
and gets a DARPA plum
to change bed pans?
We thinks
Google has
slipped into the dark side.

BigDog, Cheetah, WildCat and Atlas have joined Googles growing robot
menagerie.
Google confirmed on Friday that it had completed the acquisition of
Boston Dynamics, an engineering company
that has designed mobile research robots for the Pentagon. The company,
based in Waltham, Mass., has gained an international reputation for machines
that walk with an uncanny sense of balance and even - cheetahlike - run faster than the fastest humans.
It is the eighth robotics company that Google has acquired in the last
half-year.
Executives at the Internet giant are circumspect about what
exactly they plan to do with their robot collection. But Boston Dynamics and
its animal kingdom-themed machines bring significant cachet to Googles
robotic efforts, which are being led by Andy Rubin, the Google executive who
spearheaded the development of Android, the worlds most widely used smartphone software.
The deal is also the clearest indication yet that Google is intent on
building a new class of autonomous systems that might do anything from
warehouse work to package delivery and even elder care.

Google confirmed on
Friday that it had completed the acquisition of
Boston Dynamics, an
engineering company that has designed mobile research robots for the
Pentagon.
The company, based in
Waltham, Mass., has gained an international reputation for machines that
walk with an uncanny sense of balance and even - cheetahlike - run faster
than the fastest humans.
It is the eighth robotics company that Google
has acquired in the last half-year. Executives at the Internet giant are
circumspect about what exactly they plan to do with their robot collection.
But Boston Dynamics and its animal kingdom-themed machines bring significant
cachet to Googles robotic efforts, which are being led by
Andy Rubin, the Google executive who spearheaded the development of
Android, the worlds most widely used smartphone software.
The deal is also the clearest indication yet
that Google is intent on building a new class of autonomous systems that
might do anything from warehouse work to package delivery and even elder
care.
Boston Dynamics was founded in 1992 by Marc Raibert, a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It
has not sold robots commercially, but has pushed the limits of mobile and
off-road robotics technology, mostly for Pentagon clients like the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, or
DARPA.
Early on, the company also did
consulting work for Sony on consumer robots like the Aibo robotic dog.
Boston Dynamics walking robots have a
reputation for being extraordinarily agile, able to walk over rough terrain
and handle surfaces that in some cases are challenging even for humans.
A video (above) of one of its robots named
BigDog shows a noisy, gas-powered, four-legged, walking robot that climbs
hills, travels through snow, skitters precariously on ice and even manages
to stay upright in response to a well-placed human kick.
BigDog development
started in 2003 in partnership with the British robot maker Foster-Miller,
NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Harvard. The video has been viewed more than 15 million
times since it was posted on YouTube in 2008.
More recently, Boston Dynamics distributed
a
video (below) of a four-legged robot named WildCat, galloping in high-speed
circles in a parking lot.
Although the videos frequently inspire comments
that the robots will evolve into scary killing machines straight out of the
"Terminator" movies, Dr. Raibert has said in the past that he does not
consider his company to be a military contractor - it is merely trying to
advance robotics technology.
Google executives said the company would honor
existing military contracts, but that it did not plan to move toward
becoming a military contractor on its own.
Under a $10.8 million contract, Boston Dynamics
is currently supplying DARPA with a set of humanoid robots named Atlas to
participate in the Darpa Robotics Challenge, a two-year contest with a $2
million prize.
The contests goal is creating a class of robots that can
operate in natural disasters and catastrophes like the nuclear power plant
meltdown
in Fukushima, Japan.
"Competitions like the Darpa Robotics Challenge
stretch participants to try to solve problems that matter and we hope to
learn from the teams insights around disaster relief," Mr. Rubin said in a
statement released by Google.
Boston Dynamics has also designed robots that
can climb walls and trees as well as other two- and four-legged walking
robots, a neat match to Mr. Rubins notion that,
"computers are starting to sprout legs and
move around in the environment."
A recent video (below) shows a robot named Cheetah running on a treadmill.
This
year, the robot was clocked running 29 miles per hour, surpassing the
previous legged robot land speed record of 13.1 mph, set in 1999.
Thats
about one mile per hour faster than Jamaicas
Usain Bolt,
the two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 100-meter dash.
But its far short of a real cheetah, which can hit 65 m.p.h.
Googles other robotics acquisitions include
companies in the United States and Japan that have pioneered a range of
technologies including software for advanced robot arms, grasping technology
and computer vision. Mr. Rubin has also said that he is interested in
advancing sensor technology.
Mr. Rubin has called his robotics effort a "moonshot,"
but has declined to describe specific products that might come from the
project. He has, however, also said that he does not expect initial product
development to go on for years, indicating that Google commercial robots of
some nature could be available in the next several years.
Google declined to say how much it paid for its
newest robotics acquisition and said that it did not plan to release
financial information on any of the other companies it has recently bought.
Dr. Raibert is known as the father of walking
robots in the United States. He originally created the Leg Lab, a research
laboratory to explore walking machines at Carnegie Mellon University in
1980. He then moved the laboratory to M.I.T. before leaving academia to
build engineering systems for the military and Sony.
His research in walking robots began with a
pogo-stick project called "the hopper," which he used to test basic
concepts.
"I am excited by Andy and Googles ability
to think very, very big," Dr. Raibert said, "with the resources to make
it happen."
