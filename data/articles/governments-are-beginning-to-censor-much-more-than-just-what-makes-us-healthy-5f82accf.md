We all know how governments and the
mainstream media try their best to censor
the most effective information to prevent disease and enhance our health,
but there's a common trend emerging that is attempting to suppress anything
that may make people veer off course from government institutionalized and
mainstream thought.
In essence, restrictions on all forms
of free thinking.
By controlling the flow media, nations have learned how to control the flow
of information. Regardless of whether its attempting to convince the masses
that the sun is bad for us or mercury, radiation, plutonium and pesticides
are good for us, they're all lies to manipulate public opinion.
China has taken things one step further which could be a sign that other
nations will follow in due time. In the latest crackdown on dissent,
authorities want its citizens to uphold the country's values and not promote
anything that would re-write history.
Not that history hasn't already been re-written by those elite entities that
control the majority of the world's resources, but this is somewhat of a
stretch when it comes to further controlling our true history as a species.
The fact humans are much older than we've been told. The fact that ancient
technology has far surpassed our current methods.
The fact that human history is filled with rich
contact with inner-terrestrial and extra-terrestrial life on this planet
among others. Heaven forbid if that information was released to public.
What would happen if people actually learned
their true origin and what we really are?
Well China would love to suppress all these things. Shows that feature time
travel have been effectively banned by the Chinese government after it
issued new rules for TV and film directors. Chinese censors issued guidance
to the film and television industry, which producers would be unwise to
ignore if they want to stay on air.
Time travel is on the list of
activities that have been banned for scriptwriters and directors since March
31 that includes reincarnation and feudal superstitions.
The guidance is for makers of TV programs from the State Administration
of Radio Film and Television (SARFT)
that would make films like Back to the Future and Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure contraband material.
Outlining the reason for it's decision to ban time travel, the Chinese
government said:
'Producers and writers are treating serious
history in a frivolous way, which should by no means be encouraged
anymore.'
It added that the ban applies to films that
contain,
'fantasy, time-travel, random compilations
of mythical stories, bizarre plots, absurd techniques, even propagating
feudal superstitions, fatalism and reincarnation, ambiguous moral
lessons, and even a lack of positive thinking.'
'The government says TV dramas shouldn't
have characters that travel back in time and rewrite history,' said
CNN's Eunice Yoon.
A host of evidence over the past several weeks
shows that Chinese authorities are more determined than ever to police
cell-phone calls, electronic messages, e-mail and access to the Internet in
order to smother any hint of free thinking.
In the cat-and-mouse game that characterizes
electronic communications, analysts suggest that the cat is getting bigger,
especially since revolts began to ricochet through the Middle East and North
Africa, and homegrown efforts to organize protests in China began to
circulate on the Internet about a month ago.
'They also say that myth, superstitions and
reincarnation are all questionable.'
It also means that TV series like Dr Who,
Star Trek and the X-Files are now banned along with the film
Terminator.
The new ruling comes as the Communist party (CPC) prepares for its 90th
anniversary in power, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
SARFT issued the guidance telling film makers they must,
'Follow the central spirit of the CPC to
celebrate its 90th anniversary on television.'
'All levels should actively prepare to launch vivid reproductions of the
Chinese revolution, the nations construction and its reform and opening
up.'
The film and television arm of the government
reports directly to China's cabinet, the State Council.
It has the power to pull the plug on any Chinese film or television series
whenever and wherever it wishes.
The hard-liners have won the field, and now
we are seeing exactly how they want to run the place, said Russell
Leigh Moses, a Beijing analyst of Chinas leadership. I think the
gloves are coming off.
On Sunday, Google accused the Chinese government
of disrupting its Gmail service in the country and making it appear as if
technical problems at Google - not government intervention - were to blame.
Beyond these problems, anecdotal evidence suggests that the governments
computers, which intercept incoming data and compare it with an
ever-changing list of banned keywords or Web sites, are shutting out more
information.
The motive is often obvious:
For six months or more, the censors have
prevented Google searches of the English word freedom.
Few analysts believe that the government will
loosen controls any time soon, with events it considers politically
sensitive swamping the calendar, including a turnover in the Communist
Partys top leadership next year.
It has been double the guard, and double
the guard, and you never hear proclamations about things being relaxed,
said Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA China, an investment and strategy
consultancy based in Beijing, and a 17-year resident of China.
We have never seen this level of control in
the time I have been here, and I have been here since the beginning of
the Internet.
Analysts who study technology trends see the
censorship happening all over the world.
"This is not something confined to strictly
one or two nations," said technology expert Wilfred Pande.
"The U.S., Canada, and Europe are all seeing
some level of
censorship on the internet and
television which prevents users from seeing or hearing specific
information their governments do not want them to hear."
How far China or other countries
will do to clamp down on electronic communications is unclear. Some analysts
suggest that officials are exploring just how much inconvenience people are
willing to tolerate.
While sentiment is hard to gauge, a large
segment of society rejects censorship and will rise above it at all costs.
