# Ukraine - The Corporate Annexation

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_globalization_eu01.htm

On 12th
January 2014, a reported
50,000 "pro-Western"
Ukrainians descended upon Kiev's Independence Square to protest
against the government of President Viktor Yanukovych.
Stoked in part by an
attack on opposition leader Yuriy Lutsenko, the protest
marked the beginning of the end of Yanukovych's four year-long government.
That same day, the Financial
Times reported a major deal for US
agribusiness titan Cargill.
Business confidence
never faltered
Despite the turmoil within Ukrainian politics
after Yanukovych rejected a major trade deal with the European Union just
seven weeks earlier, Cargill was confident enough about the future to
fork over $200 million to buy a stake in Ukraine's UkrLandFarming.
According to the
Financial Times, UkrLandFarming is the world's eighth-largest land
cultivator and second
biggest egg producer. And those aren't the only eggs in Cargill's
increasingly ample basket.
On 13th December 2013, Cargill
announced the purchase
of a stake in a Black Sea grain terminal at Novorossiysk on
Russia's Black Sea coast.
The port - to the east of Russia's strategically
and historically important Crimean naval base - gives them a major
entry-point to Russian markets and adds them to the list of Big Ag
companies investing
in ports around the Black Sea, both in Russia and Ukraine.
Cargill has been in Ukraine for over
two decades, investing in grain elevators and acquiring a major Ukrainian
animal feed company in 2011. And, based on its investment in
UkrLandFarming, Cargill was decidedly confident amidst the post-EU
deal chaos.
It's a stark juxtaposition to the alarm bells
ringing out from the US media, bellicose politicians on Capitol Hill and
perplexed policymakers in the White House.
Instability - what
instability?
It's even starker when compared to the
anxiety expressed by Morgan Williams, President and CEO of the US-Ukraine
Business Council - which, according to its website, has been
"Promoting US-Ukraine business
relations since 1995."
Williams was interviewed by the International
Business Times on March 13 and, despite Cargill's demonstrated
willingness to spend, he said,
"The
instability has forced businesses to just go about their daily business
and not make future plans for investment, expansion and hiring more
employees."
In fact, Williams, who does double-duty as
Director of Government Affairs at the private equity firm SigmaBleyzer,
claimed,
"Business plans have been at a standstill."
Apparently, he wasn't aware of Cargill's
investment, which is odd given the fact that he could've simply called Van
A. Yeutter, Vice President for Corporate Affairs at Cargill, and asked him
about his company's quite active business plan.
There is little doubt Williams has the phone
number because Mr. Yuetter serves on the
Executive Committee of the selfsame US-Ukraine Business Council. It's
quite a cozy investment club, too.
According to his SigmaBleyzer
profile, Williams,
"started his work
regarding Ukraine in 1992" and has since advised American
agribusinesses "investing in the former
Soviet Union."
As an experienced fixer for Big Ag, he must be fairly
friendly with the folks on the Executive Committee.
Big Ag luminaries -
Monsanto, Eli Lilly, Dupont, John Deere...
And what a committee it is - it's a veritable
who's who of Big Ag.
Among the luminaries working tirelessly and no doubt
selflessly for a 'better, freer Ukraine' are:
-
Melissa Agustin, Director, International
Government Affairs & Trade for Monsanto
-
Brigitte Dias Ferreira, Counsel,
International Affairs for John Deere
-
Steven Nadherny, Director, Institutional
Relations for agriculture equipment-maker CNH Industrial
-
Jeff Rowe, Regional Director for DuPont
Pioneer
-
John F. Steele, Director, International
Affairs for Eli Lilly & Company
And, of course, Cargill's Van A. Yeutter.
But Cargill isn't alone in their warm feelings toward Ukraine. As Reuters
reported in May 2013,
Monsanto - the largest seed company in the world -
plans to build a $140 million
"non-GM (genetically modified) corn seed plant in Ukraine."
And right after the decision on the EU
trade deal, Jesus Madrazo, Monsanto's Vice President for Corporate
Engagement, reaffirmed his
company's "commitment to Ukraine" and,
"the importance of
creating a favorable environment that encourages innovation and fosters the
continued development of agriculture."
Monsanto's strategy includes a little
"hearts and minds" public relations,
too.
On the heels of Mr. Madrazo's reaffirmation, Monsanto
announced,
"a social
development program titled 'Grain Basket of the Future' to help rural
villagers in the country improve their quality of life."
The initiative will dole out grants of up
to $25,000 to develop programs providing,
"educational opportunities,
community empowerment, or small business development."
Immense economic
importance
The well-crafted moniker 'Grain Basket of
the Future' is telling because, once upon a time, Ukraine was known as 'the
breadbasket' of the Soviet Union.
The CIA
ranks Soviet-era Ukraine second only to Mother Russia as the,
"most economically important
component of the former Soviet Union."
In many ways, the farmland of Ukraine was the
backbone of the USSR.
Its fertile black soil generated over a quarter of the
USSR's agriculture. It exported substantial quantities of food to other
republics and its farms generated four times the output of the next-ranking
republic.
Although Ukraine's agricultural output plummeted
in the first decade after the break-up of the Soviet Union, the farming
sector has been growing spectacularly in recent years.
While Europe struggled to shake-off the Great
Recession, Ukraine's agriculture sector grew 13.7% in 2013.
Ukraine's agriculture economy is hot. Russia's
is not. Hampered by the effects of climate
change and 25
million hectares of uncultivated agricultural land, Russia lags behind
its former breadbasket.
According to the Centre for Eastern Studies,
Ukraine's agricultural exports rose from $4.3 billion in 2005 to $17.9
billion in 2012 and, harkening the heyday of the USSR, farming currently
accounts for 25% of its total exports.
Ukraine is also the world's
third-largest exporter of wheat and of corn. And corn is not just food. It
is also ethanol.
Feeding Europe
But people got to eat - particularly in Europe.
As Frank Holmes of US Global Investors assessed
in 2011, Ukraine is poised to become Europe's butcher. Meat is difficult
to ship, but Ukraine is perfectly located to satiate Europe's hunger.
Just two days after Cargill bought into
UkrLandFarming, Global Meat News
reported a huge forecasted spike in "all
kinds" of Ukrainian meat exports, with an increase of 8.1% overall and
staggering 71.4% spike in pork exports.
No wonder Eli Lilly is represented on the
US-Ukraine Business Council's Executive Committee. Its Elanco
Animal Health unit is a major manufacturer of feed supplements.
And it is also notable that Monsanto's planned
seed plant is non-GMO, perhaps anticipating an emerging GMO-unfriendly
European market and Europe's growing
appetite for organic foods.
When it comes to Big Ag's profitable future
in Europe, the stakes couldn't be higher.
A long string of Russian
losses
For Russia and its hampered farming economy,
it's another in a long string of losses to US encroachment - from NATO
expansion into Eastern Europe to US military presence to its south and onto
a major shale gas development deal recently signed by Chevron in Ukraine.
So, why was Big Ag so bullish on Ukraine, even
in the face of so much uncertainty and the predictable reaction by Russia?
The answer is that the seeds of Ukraine's turn
from Russia have been sown for the last two decades by the persistent Cold
War alliance between corporations and foreign policy. It's a version of the
'Deep
State' that is usually associated with the oil and defense industries,
but also exists in America's other heavily subsidized industry -
agriculture.
Morgan Williams is at the nexus of Big
Ag's alliance with US foreign policy.
To wit, SigmaBleyzer
touts Mr. Williams' work with,
"various
agencies of the US government, members of Congress, congressional
committees, the Embassy of Ukraine to the US, international financial
institutions, think tanks and other organizations on US-Ukraine business,
trade, investment and economic development issues."
Freedom... for US
business
As President of the US-Ukraine Business Council,
Williams has access to Council cohort - David Kramer, President of Freedom
House.
Officially a non-governmental organization, it
has been linked with
overt and covert
'democracy' efforts in places where the door isn't open to American
interests - aka US corporations.
Freedom House, the National Endowment for
Democracy and National Democratic Institute helped
fund and support the Ukrainian 'Orange Revolution' in 2004. Freedom
House is funded
directly by the US Government, the National Endowment for Democracy and
the US Department of State.
David Kramer is a former Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs and, according to his Freedom
House bio page, formerly a Senior Fellow at the Project for the New American Century.
Nuland's $5 billion for
Ukrainian 'democracy'
That puts Kramer and, by one degree of
separation, Big Ag fixer Morgan Williams in the company of PNAC co-founder
Robert Kagan who, as coincidence would have it, is married to Victoria
"F*ck the EU" Nuland, the current
Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs.
Interestingly enough, Ms. Nuland spoke to
the US-Ukrainian Foundation last 13th December, extolling
the virtues of the Euromaidan movement
as the embodiment of
"the principles and values that are the cornerstones for all free
democracies."
Nuland also told the group that the United
States had invested more than $5 billion in support of Ukraine's
"European aspirations" - meaning pulling
Ukraine away from Russia. She made her remarks on a dais featuring a
backdrop emblazoned with a
Chevron logo.
Also, her colleague and phone call buddy US
Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt
helped Chevron cook up their 50-year shale gas
deal right in Russia's kitchen.
Coca-Cola, Exxon-Mobil,
Raytheon
Although Chevron sponsored that event, it is not
listed as a supporter of the Foundation.
But the Foundation does list
the Coca-Cola Company, ExxonMobil and Raytheon as major sponsors. And, to
close the circle of influence, the US-Ukraine Business Council is also
listed as a supporter.
Which brings the story back to Big Ag's fixer -
Morgan Williams.
Although he was glum about the current state of
investment in Ukraine, he's got to wear shades when he looks into the future.
He told the
International Business Times:
"The potential
here for agriculture / agribusiness is amazing ... production here could
double. The world needs the food Ukraine could produce in the
future. Ukraine's agriculture could be a real gold mine."
Of course, his priority is to ensure that the
bread of well-connected businesses gets lavishly buttered in Russia's former
breadbasket.
And there is no better connected group of Ukraine-interested
corporations than American
agribusiness.
Given the extent of US official involvement in
Ukrainian politics - including the interesting fact that Ambassador Pyatt pledged
US assistance to the new government in investigating and rooting-out
corruption - Cargill's seemingly risky investment strategy probably wasn't
that risky, after all.
