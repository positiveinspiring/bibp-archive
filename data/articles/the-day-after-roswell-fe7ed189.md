In memory of Lt. Gen. Arthur G. Trudeau
This great man was my superior as chief of U.S. Army Research and Development. He was a man of great courage; he put on a sergeant's helmet and fought with his men at Pork Chop Hill in Korea. He was deeply religious and went on "retreats" at Loyola. He was the most brilliant man I have ever known, who only gave me one standing order: "Watch things for me, Phil. There are things we do not understand. " His accomplishments changed the world for the better. Any success I had I attribute to him and to his leadership.
