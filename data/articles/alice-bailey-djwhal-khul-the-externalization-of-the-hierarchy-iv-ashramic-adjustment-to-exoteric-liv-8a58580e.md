When the task of the preparation of men's minds is further advanced, when the knowledge of the existence of the Masters and Their hierarchical endeavor and of the united Hierarchy of our planet are a commonly recognized truth, and when active goodwill is recognized as a real national asset in all lands, then the speed of the externalization of the Hierarchy will be greatly increased; then the five spiritual centers will begin to take definite form, and will call also for recognition; the groups there working will be known, and they will also be in close touch with each other. From that time on, the network of initiates and disciples under the direction of the Masters will be worldwide, and in every field of human expression the opinion of these men and women, and of the Masters presiding at the five centers and in Their affiliated groups, will be regarded as of immense value by all governmental, economic and social organizations.
Then - under a great wave of spiritual inspiration - the divine spirit of expectancy for the reappearance of the Christ will sweep through the world; it will then be regarded as credible and creditable, and His coming will provide the germ for all world hope; the reason for this will be that the most respected, enlightened and cultured people on the planet will be looking for Him. And then, my brothers, He will come, bringing new energies of love and compassion and implementing the spirit of fresh enlightenment; to [699] these important events must also be added the new revelation for which all men wait and to which they will be able to respond, owing to the needed and new stimulation.
Many who are reading this section of my instructions will be disappointed (so futile and silly is the human mind in so many cases) because I do not choose to consider now the means whereby the Members of the Hierarchy will adjust Themselves to modern living conditions, as to what food They will eat and whether They will marry or not marry. One thing only will I say: They will take modern life and what it means and will proceed to demonstrate how that life (the normal product of the evolutionary process) can be lived divinely; They will express the highest ideal of marriage (I would here remind you that many of the Masters are married and have raised families) and demonstrate the principle which underlies the perpetuation of the race of men; They will also show how all life is one life, that the form nature is ever a sacrificial unity in the vast scheme of divine manifestation; They will show us also that whatever we do, whether we eat or drink, all must be done under correct, temperate and natural law and in a spirit of loving understanding, and ever to the glory of God. They will express ordered, temperate living in all things, and will demonstrate also the possibility of the existence of people on earth who have no wrong inclinations and no bad qualities in their natures. They will stand forth as living examples of goodwill, of true love, of intelligent applied wisdom, of high good nature and humor, and of normalcy. They may indeed be so normal that recognition of what They are may escape notice.
They will, finally, demonstrate to all around Them the significance of right motive, the beauty of selfless service and a vivid intellectual perception. This, my brothers, is such a platitudinous statement, from the point of view of the nice well-meaning person, that its value may escape your attention. Yet it is a statement that, any initiate will tell you, warrants your closest attention and consideration [700] - a consideration which must be followed by an effort to express these same qualities upon your way towards the Door of Initiation.
