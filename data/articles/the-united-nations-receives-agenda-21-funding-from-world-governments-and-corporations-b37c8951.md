Governments and private sector corporations have
pledged to fund the United Nations
endeavors toward global governance with a generous $513 billion for Agenda
21 project that will restrict the movements of humans, perverse biodiversity
and assist the UN in attaining their Millennium Development Goals.
Secretary-General Sha Zukang of the UN Conference on Sustainable
Development (UNCSD)
said that over 692 monetary promises were given to the UN.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was thrilled that so much money had
been given to the UN.
These huge numbers give a sense of the
scale and growth of investment going into sustainable development. They
are part of a growing global movement for change. Our job now is to
create a critical mass, an irresistible momentum.
Corporations like PepsiCo, and Virgins CEO
Richard Branson project Carbon War Room are receiving $2 billion from
the US government.
Jose-Angel Gurria, secretary-general of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development,
explained:
Without the private sector its not going
to work. While governments put up the seed money, the big numbers come
from the private sector. The private sector is looking at green growth
with great interest, seeing it as an opportunity, as jobs, as
investment.
Academia and universities in places like Bejing,
Sydney, Paris and New York will conduct and fund Agenda 21 projects on
mega-city sustainability. Most of the $1 trillion allotted will go to
projects in turbine, solar, biofuel and geothermal energy.
Manish Bapna, acting president of the World Resources Institute
(WRI),
a Washington-based environmental research group, said:
Theres no doubt that Rio+20 fell short.
But its a mistake to conflate what happened here with whats happening
on the ground. You just need to look beyond the walls of the conference
to find real-world examples of action.
The
Natural Resources Defense Council will
target specific commitments concerning environmental advocacy that is
intended to coerce the public into making the much needed rally cry for the
new sustainable changes to our lives that the global Elite want to
implement.
Bjorn Lomborg, professor at Copenhagen Business School, admonishes
the follow-through records of governments as very poor and says they
should be made to follow the recommendations set out at the conference in
Rio.
Lomborg explains that the UN has turned to
corporations to help them.
Hillary Clinton, US Secretary of State supports the incorporation of
the Agenda 21 movement.
She remarked that,
sustainability wont happen without
business investment. Governments alone cannot solve all the problems we
face, from climate change to persistent poverty to chronic energy
shortages. Thats why we are so strongly in favor of partnerships.
As far as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is
concerned, the money from corporations and governments cannot come at a
better time.
Ki-moon claims that words must translate into
action with regard to moving the environmental governance agenda forward.
Ki-moon says that since the first UNCSD, the incremental slide toward total
global governance has spawned UN conventions on climate change, biodiversity
and desertification, as well as the Agenda 21 blueprint for sustainable
development, yet,
progress has been too slow - we have not
gone far enough down the road. We are now in sight of a historic
agreement - the world is waiting to see if words will translate into
action, as we know they must.
The
Asian
Development Bank, one of 8 international development financial
institutions have agreed to give the UN $175 billion for sustainable
transportation schemes to be built and running within 10 years.
Holger Dalkmann, of the WRI, believe that greenhouse gas emissions
must be drastically cut by the controlled utilization of sustainable
transport to replace private cars to ensure,
cleaner air, less congested roads, and
safer transportation.
Businesses must be balancing costs with
sustainability in order to continue doing business.
Nick Clegg, UK Deputy Prime Minister
calls this practice a false economy and
demands transparency from British corporations.
Gro Harlem Brundtland, says that corporate power must be merged with
the UNs sustainable development goals if they are to be successful.
Governments like Russia, the Middle Eastern Nations and Latin America have
been ruled as opposing the UNs Agenda 21 policies.
Redirecting cash flow toward under-developed nations in a huge money
laundering scheme is what the UN are planning. Endorsing green economies as
defined by the UNs standards are being forced upon South African nations
right now.
Jeffrey Sachs, professor at Columbia University and special adviser
to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon strongly suggests that:
Those of us who look at this day in, day
out know that many poor countries need that kind of help. And it does
not do any good to cite large ambitious promises many years out, and
then behind the scenes to say were not going to talk about how theyre
going to be fulfilled.
Lisa Jackson, administrator for the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) affirmed that the US is committed
to the UNs Agenda 21 and the green economy that is required to sustain
the scheme.
Brundtland explains that governments should work more closely with the
powerful corporations to synergize,
our political system, corporations,
businesses and people who have economic power influence political
decision-makers - thats a fact, and so its part of the analysis.
The UN is currently fine-tuning their UN
climate agreement that will be ushered in at the next Copenhagen
conference.
It is there that the world will see the
unveiling of legal force, corporate influence and the march toward global
governance called "Agenda 21."
