Lucid and aware people observing world events
unfold over the past decade or so - say, since September 11, 2001 - will
have surely asked themselves what on Earth is going on here?
We see ever-growing violence, war, outright
lies, invasions, false flags, social upheavals, poverty, ruin and the death
of millions
The worlds become a pretty dangerous and pitiful place to live
in, and it only gets worse
Which leads us to the obvious question:
Why? Why is all this happening? Can we
explain it away as Mans wicked nature? Or his folly and ignorance?
Perhaps just a series of bad mistakes and wrong turns on key issues?
Most everybody will have a ready reply, no doubt
colored by his or her own philosophical outlook.
The more rational will say
its just wrong decisions taken by normal people in an environment of
growing complexity. Optimists will shrug their shoulders playing
things down with the quaint statement that theres always been war,
persecution, poverty and corruption
Pessimists, as always, will complain
that were all doomed, especially if they are
2012-repent-the-end-of-the-world-draws-nigh types.
What, then, should we think?
First, A Word About "Conspiracies
"
If you dont buy any of the above explanations,
and you feel that todays calamities are being purposefully engineered -
that some group of people somewhere control the course of world events -
then be careful because you risk being branded another paranoid,
hallucinating, conspiracy theory kook.
Dont let that worry you too much because those
who disqualify as mere conspiracy theories any attempt to put together an
alternative model of how global power really works are either,
-
blissfully ignorant and believe in the
world according to CNN and FoxNews
-
near-sighted on key long-term
geopolitical processes
-
purposely deceptive and thus have an axe
to grind protecting the Global Power Elite, which always reacts with
uneasiness whenever someone shines a light on them.
I will only deal with the last of these options.
Debunking conspiracy theory accusations is
really not all that hard because what is thus branded is really just normal
human behavior.
Or should we yell Conspiracy! every
time two or more people having common interests and goals come together to
coordinate and articulate their actions, joining forces to promote such
goals and objectives more easily and with a higher degree of certainty?
We see this at work in our community, schools,
even in our own families. Such normal human behavior is so ubiquitous that
nobody bothers to mention it - that is not until you point out the highest
echelons of world power also do exactly the same.
Every time somebody says very powerful
individuals and entities quite predictably also engage in common
actions, planning, and agreements in order to achieve common goals, the
C-word kicks in with all its might ready to kill any such line of thought
or investigation dead in its tracks.
How dare you say that global bankers plot to
manipulate money and finance so they can control economies, markets,
governments and the media!
How dare you insinuate that the rich and
powerful create organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) or
the
Trilateral Commission to do their geopolitical mega planning supporting
long-term
Global Power Elite interests bent on imposing World Government on
Mankind!
How can you be so paranoid as to even suggest
that Money Power uses its clout to place their people in the White House,
Parliament, Downing Street, the Casa Rosada, and Editors desks in all major
media outlets?
That is the mainstream reaction whenever we
speak of bankers, oil men, defence contractors, politicians, journalists and
their respective corporations, organizations, banks, lobbies, lodges, armies
- who all most clearly do have common interests and objectives -
coming together and using their vast money flows to exert iron-fist control
over society.
This is all so obvious that only very naïve
people (or very cheeky analysts on the Elite payroll!) conclude otherwise.
What is really naïve is to think that George Soros never picks up
the phone to discuss mutual plans with Sir
Henry
Kissinger or Christine Lagarde; or that
David Rockefeller never dines
with his
Rothschild, Morgan and Warburg
brethren.
Dont be taken aback by the C word.
Whoever uses it to silence lucid and aware people do so because they know
nothing is more dangerous to them than
lucid and
aware people!
Lets now take a look at how the world really works,
call it conspiracy or otherwise.
World Government
The dream of erecting a world government
controlled by a very small, extremely powerful and elusive minority goes
back several centuries.
Its roots lie not just on the political stage
but, more so, in social, cultural and religious spheres, often with
symbolic, occult overtones. In our time it has been variously described
under the guise of,
Call it what you will, the facts are that
national sovereignty, which is the ability of the People to organize around
nation-states, to make the final decisions on their own affairs, from being
a sharply defined concept is now so eroded and diffuse that no one can
readily define exactly what sovereignty means today.
Maybe this would be acceptable if national
sovereignty were lessened for the sake of better coping with global problems
affecting Mankind as a whole - for the 'Common Good' - however increasing
famine, disease, contamination and war shows a very different picture.
Why? The reason is that basically World
Government is not emerging around robust global public institutions that
have (or should have) the Public Good of We the People in the forefront, but
rather around private organizations that have sectorial profit and
interests at their forefront.
In fact, the World Government we see
rising before our eyes has one key, seldom mentioned, characteristic: its
private.
Private Power
Lets start from basics:
-
What drives the world today is not
justice, its not the pursuit of the Common Good, nor international
law, nor ethical values, nor democracy.
-
What governs the world is Power
and today Power has been illegitimately amassed in the
hands of a tiny usurping minority.
What do we mean by Power?
Firstly, Power is the concrete ability to
plan, promote, organize, and carry out actions, the results of
which invariably lead to specific and desired objectives and goals in the
short, medium and long terms.
Power is the capacity and ability to make
certain things happen irrespective of any resistance, and at the same time
blocking certain other things
from happening irrespective of their force; if need be by war
This definition spans political, economic,
industrial, financial, business, technological, cultural, psychological and
(usually, in the last instance) military stages. The exercise of Power
requires coordinated and intelligent use of all resources at hand - whether
plentiful or lean, physical or virtual - with the view of achieving concrete
objectives and goals.
Secondly, we should differentiate Formal Power
from Real Power. What the media show us are the very high profile visible results of
actions carried out by Formal Power structures, i.e.,
-
national governments
-
financial markets
-
the media
However, Real Power levers that make things
happen are far less visible.
They plan out what happens in the world, when it
happens, where, and who makes it happen. Symmetries between Real Power and
Formal Power help explain how our global system works.
Lets recap:
-
Real Power,
is
centered on discrete proactive structures and organizations
that drive concrete and effective political, economic and social
processes in a nation, a region, a social class, a public or private
institution, or a combination of these. Its effectiveness stems from
its continuity in time that allows it to grow and leverage
its capacity for world domination.
Real
Power structures drive causes which, although
themselves not visible, nevertheless generate highly visible
results.
-
Formal Power,
is
centered on structures that are for the most part reactive
executors of strategies and decisions emanating from Real
Power structures. These include high profile structures
like major multinational corporations, transnational banks,
multimedia monopolies, key universities and the top echelons of
government in all countries (presidents, cabinet members,
congressmen, judges).
Formal Power structures are accountable for
high-profile effects that have their roots in low profile
causes emanating from Real Power structures.
The conquest and use of power has much in common
with surfing:
a dangerous staying balanced, a perilous not
falling off the board, a flexible control of speed, direction and pitch.
Good surfers ride the wave just as Italian
philosopher Julius Evola recommended we learn to Ride
the tiger... Come to think of it power also seems to have a
feline, hunting and preying style and gait to it.
This leads to the need of clearly grasping
a fundamental and harsh Law of Power:
Those
who have Power use it to promote and drive their objectives and
interests; those who do NOT have Power must suffer the consequences of
the actions of those who do have the Power to promote and drive
their objectives and interests.
Here lie the roots of the dramatic situation
most countries suffer today because power is no longer in the hands of
people and organizations working towards the Common Good.
The Pyramid
It helps to approach Power from a Corporate
viewpoint.
After all, the modern corporation developed,
thrived and survived enormously over centuries of time becoming a key driver
in the on-going shift that privatised power, transferring the reins of
control from public political institutions to eminently private economic
structures articulated in three vertical hierarchical levels:
-
Shareholders,
who
are the real owners and controllers of the Corporation, even if they
seldom or ever become involved in its operational and administrative
processes. Shareholders focus on finance, not economic production
-
Directors,
who
represent shareholders and supervise/oversee the correct, efficient
and proper operation of the Corporation in accordance with
shareholder interest. They are accountable for ensuring maximum
growth of present and future stock yields with minimum expense, thus
making the capitalist corporation intrinsically an antisocial agent
-
Managers,
who
are well-paid employees accountable for the day-to-day running of
the Corporation. Normally, they are trained and hard working
specialists who add value to the Corporation through their talent,
organizational skills and discipline
Today the superstructure of a veritable World
Government already exist, but for the most part we do not recognize it as
such because the paradigms normally associated with the concept of
government are not readily visible.
Rather, since power has become privatized,
todays World Government has much more in common with traditional private power
structures described above.
This lies at the very foundations of
globalization, where power is private and democracy is the preferred
political system through which private power structures control public
government i.e., through money.
Therefore public power - government - in
almost every country can only occupy the lower level of decision-making,
-
President
-
Prime Minister
-
Congress
-
Parliament, etc.
Medium and upper level decisions all lie above
or outside national governments and countries, so we the People have no
access or control over them, even though they deeply affect us all.
Lets have a closer look at how this hierarchy
of global power plays out in practice:
Top Level Decisions
(i.e., the Owners of this world) - Geopolitical Scope
In the private corporate world, upper level
decisions are taken by shareholders.
In the public World Government this is done by
the Global Power Elite. Save in major countries as the US, UK,
Russia, China and France, national governments have little or no access to
this upper decision level where the Masters of the World wield Real Power.
This is all coordinated by and grouped around
the following major axes dealing with the geopolitical:
-
Think Tanks
A compact, hierarchical, seamless and very
powerful global network of geostrategic planning centers - so-called
think tanks - notably,
...amongst others.
Their job is to plan out the long-term
development of complex political, economic, financial,
technological, military and cultural processes, integrating them
into consistent, sustainable and complex geopolitical models, geared
to achieving growing long-term national, regional and global
domination.
-
Finance Dynastic Families
Wielding immense economic, financial and social power and fortune
since generations, even centuries: i.e., Rothschild, Rockefeller,
Morgan, Mellon, Bin-Laden, Bush, Buffet and others.
-
Royal Dynasties and Noble
Bloodlines
Who wielded social,
economic, religious and financial Power for centuries (i.e.,
the ruling nobilities of Britain,
Holland, Spain, Belgium, as well as the uncrowned nobilities in
France, Germany, Austria, Italy and Portugal). They closely link-in
with their counterparts in Islamic sheikdoms and patrician financial
nobilities in the US and Far East.
-
Religious Organizations
Political structures of
key religious faiths, notably The
Vatican, Church of England, Lutheran and Calvinist Churches, the
Jewish Sanhedrin, Evangelical and Pentecostal organizations, many of
them staunchly pro-Zionist.
-
Supranational Political
Structures
Freemasonry,
Zionism, International Social
Democracy, International Christian Democracy, various NGOs and
lobbies. Here we find the highest echelons of global power coming
together at its pyramidal apex.
No doubt, whatever lies behind
Illuminati tradition dwells here:
-
a compact Round Table of
Elders representing money power
-
Dynastic families, Kings, Queens
and Sheiks
-
Vatican priests, Rabbis,
Lutheran and Anglican clergy
-
the bloodlines from where the
future King of the World shall arise...
The buck stops there.
-
Organized Crime
Not surprisingly organized crime interacts with legitimate power
structures and may even be created by them under various
operational agreements.
This brings under the fold various Mafias, arms dealers,
drug cartels, money launderers, plus their respective financial
managers.
Boundaries are not clear-cut because
organized criminal groups seem to have successfully embedded
themselves into legitimate organizations, including,
The New World Order power structure
contains pacts and agreements forged with major criminal
organizations willing to respect and abide by unwritten guidelines
and rules of engagement.
Mid-Level Decisions (the Deciders) -
Strategic Scope
In the private corporate world, these are in the
hands of the Directors.
In the public World Government this refers to a
set of major players: multinational corporations, transnational financial
institutions, media monopolies, major universities, and specific sectors in
all national governments, notably in the areas of foreign policy, economics
and defence.
They direct and channel huge resources to
finance political campaigns that promote previously screened, selected and
approved political parties and candidates, maintaining a credible balance
and image in order to ensure the electorate always have the - albeit, false
- impression that the people elect those who govern them: lets call this
the democracy game.
Monopoly multimedia organizations, in turn,
execute intense short-term PsyOps campaigns (e.g., right before an
election), whilst the educational system executes medium- and long-term
psychological pressure to ensure the population at large believe, accept,
embrace and play the democracy game questioning little or nothing about
it.
Lower Level Decisions (Day-to-Day
Operators) - Operational Scope
In the private corporate world, these are in the
hands of Managers.
In the public World Government, these are the Authorities:
i.e., governments, law enforcement agencies, armed & security forces,
controlling and supervisory entities, and the like.
It includes The President or Prime Minister
as head of the Executive Branch, Congressmen and women (or Parliamentarians)
in the Legislative, and judges in the Judiciary branches of public
government.
A nations president or prime minister is thus
limited to merely executing short-term management level decisions during
their short tenures in office (usually, three or four years with, perhaps,
one possible re-election term: clearly too short a span to consolidate
continuity of power).
They can be described as the CEOs of our
countries with clipped wings and permanently challenged by a similar tightly
controlled group of pre-selected opposition candidates, also canvassed,
screened and approved by the Directors and Shareholders of the Global
Power Elite who control the whole democracy game, financing
costly election campaigns and media-based PsyOps.
Dynamics
Another major cause of violence and conflict
today is that financial, economic and social processes have very different
dynamics and their own time factors, so to speak:
-
Finance (High
Speed Change)
Modern technology allow finance to move
instantaneously as financial operators and players around the world
speculate, invest, divest, migrate from one market to another, from
one currency to another, using extremely powerful computer, software
and telecom networks at the speed of light, 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week.
Dynamics:
Finances time runs in seconds and minutes, and has become highly
automated. This huge advantage helps to explain why Finance today
reigns supreme over us all.
-
Economy (Moderate
Speed Change)
Economic processes run at a much slower pace because
building cars, airplanes, and TV sets; manufacturing cookies and
clothing; rendering services, erecting plants and factories;
training and recruiting workers, requires planning, knowledge, time
and effort.
Dynamics:
Economys time runs in days, weeks, months, even years. The Real
Economy thus operates at a slower speed than Virtual Finance to
which it is unnaturally subordinated.
-
Societal (Slow
Speed Change)
Collective processes governing changes in mental
paradigms, ethical values, social customs, habits and styles, etc.,
are much, much slower still. Today, we experience unprecedented
social and cultural re-engineering on a planetary scale.
The two main instruments driving Social
Change are:
-
The School System
- Education on social, cultural, economic and political
matters has become distorted, contaminated, deconstructed,
eroded, emptied of content and turned upside down, on all
manners that need accommodating and alignment to support and
promote the mental profile that Global Power Elite planners
demand.
-
The Media
- Aside from distorting our
world view of reality through the press, it also uses
entertainment and show business to promote demoralizing,
destructive, often perverse content, inspired by the age-old
collective dumbing-down method prevalent in the latter days
of the Roman Empire - panem
et circenses: bread and circuses - with the added
value of todays technologies.
Dynamics:
Social and cultural change is very slow. Its time runs in decades,
generations; even centuries.
The Wheel of World Power
Todays global geopolitical power architecture
would look something like this:
-
Major Multinational
Industrial Corporations
The Fortune
500 of industry, services, retailing, oil, energy, mining, R&D, defence, aerospace, foodstuff, agricultural, chemical, construction,
shipping, consulting, etc.
-
Private Financial
Institutions
Inter- and
trans-national banks, financial consultants, risk-rating agencies,
stock exchanges, fund managers, insurance and reinsurance companies,
pensions and investment funds, etc.
-
Multilateral National and
Supranational Entities
The
International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank,
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), Bank of International
Settlements, all national central banks, notably the
US Federal Reserve Bank and the
European Central Bank, the United Nations, and others.
-
Universities and Academia
In political science, international
and government relations, and economics (i.e., Harvard, MIT,
Columbia, Princeton, Yale, Johns Hopkins, Chicago, Stanford,
Georgetown, Oxford, Cambridge, London School of Economics).
-
Multimedia Monopolies
The New York Times, Washington
Post, Newsweek, CNN-Time Warner, CBS, MSNBC, Fox, BBC, The
Economist, Der Spiegel, Foreign Affairs, Reuters.
-
Government
Key domestic and foreign policy, economic, financial and monetary
posts.
In order to serve New World Order goals and
interests, this Wheel of Power must spin in a specific direction,
steered from its hub which is controlled by a discrete, though not
secret, network of think-tanks and geopolitical planning centers, acting
flexibly, sequentially and consistently.
It gives each of the major axes of power their
specific libretto, to act out so that each, at the right time, does what
it needs to do within a much wider plan spanning the world for decades to
come.
This is a highly hierarchical, disciplined,
pyramid-like scheme and as we observe its operators and players further down
the pyramid they become increasingly numerous and less aware of the full
picture.
As in the intelligence community, each player
operates on a need to know basis, where only those at the very top or near
the apex can have a birds eye view of what is happening, and how everything
ties in neatly into a long-term Master Plan.
For those with a taste for the symbolic, thats
the All-Seeing Eye symbol on the US one-dollar bill
Big Money Power
Big money power is profoundly anti-democratic.
It has always surprised me the way politicians,
the media, intellectuals, academics and opinion-makers speak mouthfuls
about democracy insisting it be imposed upon everybody everywhere and yet
we never hear a word about the urgent need of democratizing
finance and the economy.
Theres a taboo around that idea, even though it
is absolutely plain for all to see that finance and the economy are governed
by strict authoritarianism of a most undemocratic flavor.
However, none of the people who should point
this out to global public opinion - journalists, analysts, politicians -
dare do so.
Poderoso Señor es Don Dinero - Money
is a Powerful Lord - wrote Spanish poet Don Francisco de Quevedo y
Villegas four centuries ago. And it is certainly sobering to see how
this powerful gentleman, Lord Money, marches ever so strong in our
terrible 21st century.
World Government is already upon us.
For many decades it has functioned as a sort of
global shadow government preparing to take a major leap to become a formal
and legally binding World Government. It confronts the world with a system
of thought in which democracy and capitalism contain their own values,
which means that in order to participate in them, we must accept those
values; even transcendental values on such matters as justice, happiness and
the like.
Citizens must therefore give up their minds to
the System, which is neither political nor economic, but rather a system of
consciousness.
Democracy and capitalism are systems of
consciousness. People do not realize this but their minds are determined by
these systems. This is why democracy and capitalism represent a totalitarian
regime.
Totalitarianism means total control of society
never has there been totalitarianism as strong as we have today. The
totalitarianism of the democratic and capitalist systems is so
sophisticated, that even our desires are determined by the System. We desire
that which society wishes we desire.
It cannot be said loud enough. If true democracy
is government of, by and for the majority of We the People for the purpose
of protecting and promoting the Common Good, and the democracy game were
all forced to play today is fully subservient and subordinated to
UNdemocratic money power, then it follows that there is NO democracy,
anywhere.
Not to understand this is not to understand how
the global power system really works which, in turn, means not
being able to arrive at a correct diagnosis as to why things are
going badly in this world.
And if we dont get our diagnostics right, then
no cure will ever be found for this sickly state of affairs.
Its high time we open our minds and eyes to
this!
