vaccinate millions of individuals worldwide.
The deadly Garasil vaccine is their prized weapon because of its
high mortality rate.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
today announced 78 grants of US$100,000 each in the latest round of
Grand Challenges Explorations. Grants include the development of a

Johnson.
-
The Gates Foundation held stock in Merck
at a time when it developed partnerships with the African
Comprehensive AIDS and Malaria Partnership and the Merck Company

-
Gates continues to push vaccines when
the pharmaceutical vaccine makers do not speak about the enormous
health damage from infant vaccination including autism and numerous
neuro-muscular deformities that have been traced back to
the toxic adjuvants and
preservatives used in most vaccines.
-
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
are also financing a project called The Alliance for a Green
Revolution in Africa (AGRA).
Monsanto,
DuPont, Dow, Syngenta and other
major GMO agribusiness giants are reported at the heart of AGRA,
using it as a back-door to spread their patented GMO seeds across
Africa under the deceptive label, bio-technology,' a euphemism for
genetically engineered patented seeds.
-
The Gates Foundation, according to their
website, wants to vaccinate the entire world population, despite
medical evidence that vaccinations are deadly.
-
The World Health Organization, one of
GAVI's partners, teamed up with the World Bank and UN Population
Fund in the 1970â€²s under the "Task Force on Vaccines for Fertility

acts as a global coordinating body
for anti-fertility vaccine R&D."
GAVI is heavily funded by the
Bill
& Melinda Gates Foundation for the global vaccination projects.

One of the programs funded by the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation is a sterilization program that would use
sharp blasts of ultrasound directed against a man's scrotum to
render him infertile for six months. It might accurately be called a

-
When a billionaire like
Bill Gates
suddenly becomes entranced by vaccines as
philanthropy the world should take
notice. Studies have come out refuting the necessity of these
vaccines as a risk to public health, yet Gates continues on.
In an answer to the alternative media's
exposure to his death peddling, Gates has bought ABC News as an
attempt to gain back his influence on the public.
All the power grabbing and manipulation
of the media does not change the fact that the world is waking up to
the dangers of vaccines, refusing to have them or give them to their
children.
-
Third world countries are in a less
advantageous stance to refuse these poisons.
This is a grave injustice being forced
onto these people. Where medical care should be helping, it is only
contributing to the mounting death toll thanks to Bill Gates.
