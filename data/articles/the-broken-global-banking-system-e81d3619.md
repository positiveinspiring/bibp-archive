Let's be honest: the banking system is now fully
dysfunctional.
It has failed in its primary purpose: to act as
a machine for lending into the real economy. Instead the banking system has
been turned on its head, and become a borrowing machine.
HuffPost readers, I know, are smart and on the button when it comes to
bankers and their wicked ways. But how many Americans understand how broken
and defective the banking system as a whole has become? For the crazy facts
are these: bankers now borrow from their customers and from taxpayers. They
are effectively draining funds from household bank accounts, small
businesses, corporations, government Treasuries and from e.g.
the
Federal Reserve.
They do so by charging high rates of interest
and fees; by demanding early repayment of loans; by
illegally foreclosing on homeowners, and by
appropriating, and then speculating with trillions of dollars of
taxpayer-backed resources.
A report out today, "Where
did our money go?" from the
London-based new economics foundation (declaration of interest: I am
a Fellow of
NEF) - reveals that net lending to households and firms is
negative.
British banks are currently borrowing £12
billion ($18bn) a month to maintain existing levels of activity. According
to the Bank of England, by 2011 they will have to borrow £25 billion ($39bn)
a month - and the Bank is skeptical they can continue to raise that level of
funding.
According to the
Bank of England, UK banks are not alone in
facing a significant refinancing challenge. Global banks are estimated to
have around US$5 trillion of medium to long-term funding maturing over the
next three years, and 'the scale of competition for funds in global markets'
is intense.
By borrowing from the real economy, and then refusing to lend, except at
high rates of interest, bankers are effectively performing a lobotomy on the
real economy.
They are cutting critical credit connections to
and from the vital 'cortex' - the region of the economy responsible for
investment and the creation of jobs.
Without a sound banking system and
cheap, carefully regulated credit, the public and private sectors will not
invest in e.g. green jobs or infrastructure. Output will continue to
plummet, and unemployment and poverty to rise.
The banking system was invented in,
-
14th century Florence
-
16th century
London
-
17th century Amsterdam,
...to create and disburse credit.
We learned nearly five hundred years ago that a
sound banking system could do just that, stimulating trade and other forms
of economic activity. The effortless and almost costless creation of credit
by both central and commercial banks creates deposits and savings - and not
the other way around.
This is contrary to the archaic ideas of the 'classical' economists (for
which read:
the Chicago School).
Deposits and savings are not the result of
economic activity; nor is
Quantitative Easing. Instead they are the
result of credit creation - which can then be used to finance investment and
jobs. Today, as NEF's report shows, thanks to the persistence of archaic,
neo-liberal economic theories of finance, the banking system has frozen
lending and been turned on its head.
Instead of lending into the economy, bankers are borrowing from the real
economy.
Lunatic asylums are rightly discredited. Their treatment of patients was
often barbaric and ultimately ineffective - so they were consigned to the
dustbin of history.
Like the asylums of yesteryear, banks are no longer fit for purpose. Their
treatment of businesses and households is blunt and brutal. Built on
monetary theory as outdated as Victorian lunatic asylums, the banking system
is likely to implode again. That is why governments are cutting back on
spending, and shoring up funds - fully expecting another banking bailout.
The governor of the European Central Bank
declared as much in the FT on 5 September, this year.
What can Huff Post readers do? Get out of the 'veal
pen' and refuse to cede the battleground to Tea Parties.
In other words, organize, don't agonize.
