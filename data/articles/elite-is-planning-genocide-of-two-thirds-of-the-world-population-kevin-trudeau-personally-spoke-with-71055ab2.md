Billionaire entrepreneur Kevin Trudeau,
who has been constantly harassed and sued by
the FTC (Federal Trade
Commission) for promoting alternative health treatments, told The Alex
Jones Show yesterday that elitists and Bilderberg members who he had
personally conversed with spoke of their desire to see two thirds of the
dumb people wiped off the planet.
Trudeau admitted that he was in Greece recently and implied that he attended
the Bilderberg Group meeting, while also stating that he personally knew
many Bilderberg members who he conversed with on a regular basis.
Overpopulation is a primary concern of the elite, and it was the subject of
a recent clan-destine meeting of billionaire philanthropists in New York.
Elitists veil their agenda with the humanitarian
rhetoric of the need to naturally reduce world population by means of
contraception and education, whereas in reality, as we have exhaustively
documented, their program has its origins in the inhumane pseudo-science of
eugenics which first flourished in Britain, and the ideology of racial and
genetic superiority that was later adapted by the Nazis with the aid of
Rockefeller funding.
Some of the conversations you have on the
200 foot yachts off the coast of Monaco you cant believe what really
goes on behind closed doors, said Trudeau, noting that Alex Jones had
exposed such issues in his documentary films, notably Endgame.
The billionaire said that he had recently spent
time in Monaco with Crown Prince Albert II.
Trudeau stated that elitists he had talked to
thought their plans were for the greater good of humanity but that they
believed there were two classes of people on earth, the ruling elite and the
worker bees, and that
the Elite were defined not necessarily by money or
power, but by their genetic ancestry.
Trudeau shockingly detailed conversations with elitists during which they
brazenly admitted their desire for massive global population reduction.
Ive been sitting on the boats off the
coast of Barbados with the guys who basically said we need to get
two-thirds of the dumb people off the planet Ive been in the
meetings, said Trudeau, adding that such words were not spoken in an
evil manner, but in a matter of fact way under the pretext that such a
thing would be for the good of planet earth.
Revealingly, Trudeau said that elitists see Alex
Jones as an annoyance but tolerate him because they believe Jones as well as
Trudeau himself are, desensitizing people to these realities, which in a
way works to their benefit.
Ive been told thats why I still get
invited on the yachts, added Trudeau.
Trudeau said that the elite was divided into two
camps, one larger faction that,
Categorically believes they are genetically
superior than the rest of the population, and an-other smaller faction,
mainly comprising of younger people, that are feeding Trudeau
information who, have come to the conclusion that some people are
smarter than others, some people are more talented than others, some
people are more motivated to work
but everyone should be allowed to
succeed or fail based on their own choices or initiative
and thats
where theres a split and a division right now at the highest levels,
said Trudeau.
