# CIA Controls Mass Media like The NY Times, Time Magazine and Much More

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/sociopol_cia30.htm

In 1953, Joseph Alsop, then one of Americas leading
syndicated columnists, went to the Philippines to cover an
election.
He did not go because he was
asked to do so by his syndicate. He did not go because he was
asked to do so by the newspapers that printed his column. He
went at the request of the CIA.
Alsop is one of more than 400 American journalists who in the
past twenty‑five years have secretly carried out assignments for
the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents on file
at CIA headquarters. Some of these journalists relationships
with the Agency were tacit; some were explicit.
There was cooperation, accommodation and overlap. Journalists
provided a full range of clandestine services - from simple
intelligence gathering to serving as go‑betweens with spies in
Communist countries. Reporters shared their notebooks with the
CIA.
Editors shared their staffs.
Some of the journalists were Pulitzer Prize winners,
distinguished reporters who considered themselves ambassadors
without‑portfolio for their country.
Most were less exalted:
-
foreign correspondents who
found that their association with the Agency helped
their work
-
stringers and freelancers
who were as interested in the derring‑do of the spy
business as in filing articles
-
the smallest category,
full‑time CIA employees masquerading as journalists
abroad
In many instances, CIA
documents show, journalists were engaged to perform tasks for
the CIA with the consent of the managements of Americas leading
news organizations.
The use of journalists has been among the most productive means
of intelligence‑gathering employed by the CIA. Although the
Agency has cut back sharply on the use of reporters since 1973
primarily as a result of pressure from the media), some
journalist‑operatives are still posted abroad.
Further investigation into the matter, CIA officials say, would
inevitably reveal a series of embarrassing relationships in the
1950s and 1960s with some of the most powerful organizations and
individuals in American journalism.
The US government has no
external "need to manipulate" mass media outlets such as "Time
magazine, for example, because there are Agency [CIA]
people at the management
level."
Former CIA employee Barry Eisler explains why you
shouldn't trust the CIA. Listen below the podcast:
Former CIA Employee Barry Eisler Explains
why...
You Shouldn't Trust the CIA
If you
checked out last week's episode, you know
that Barry Eisler is a bestselling author
with a lot to say about the publishing
industry.
What
you might not know is that he also used to
work for the CIA, and he's got a lot to say
about that world as well.
This
week, Barry is back to talk about the
culture and inner workings of the
intelligence community.
Remember there are

The CIAs use of the American
news media has been much more extensive than Agency officials
have acknowledged publicly or in closed sessions with members of
Congress.
The general outlines of what
happened are indisputable; the specifics are harder to come by.
CIA sources hint that a particular journalist was trafficking
all over Eastern Europe for the Agency; the journalist says no,
he just had lunch with the station chief. CIA sources say flatly
that a well‑known ABC correspondent worked for the Agency
through 1973; they refuse to identify him.
A high‑level CIA official with
a prodigious memory says that the New York Times
provided cover for about ten CIA operatives between 1950 and
1966; he does not know who they were, or who in the newspapers
management made the arrangements.
The Agencys special relationships with the so‑called "majors"
in publishing and broadcasting enabled the CIA to post some of
its most valuable operatives abroad without exposure for more
than two decades.
In most instances, Agency
files show, officials at the highest levels of the CIA (usually
director or deputy director) dealt personally with a single
designated individual in the top management of the cooperating
news organization.
The aid furnished often took two forms:
-
providing jobs and
credentials "journalistic cover" (in Agency parlance)
for CIA operatives about to be posted in foreign
capitals
-
lending the Agency the
undercover services of reporters already on staff,
including some of the best‑known correspondents in the
business
CIA officials almost always
refuse to divulge the names of journalists who have cooperated
with the Agency.
They say it would be unfair to
judge these individuals in a context different from the one that
spawned the relationships in the first place.
"There was a time when it
wasnt considered a crime to serve your government," said
one high‑level CIA official who makes no secret of his
bitterness.
"This all has to be
considered in the context of the morality of the times,
rather than against latter‑day standards - and hypocritical
standards at that."
