"The West won the world not by the
superiority of its ideas or values or religion [
]
but rather by its superiority in applying
organized violence.
Westerners often forget this fact;
non-Westerners never do."
American Professor Samuel P. Huntington,
"The Clash of Civilizations and
the Remaking of World Order"
"Violence can only be concealed by a lie,
and the lie can only be maintained by violence.
Any man who has once proclaimed violence as his
method
is inevitably forced to take the lie as his
principle".
Russian Writer Alexander Solzehnitsyn
Since the beginning of Europe's Age of Discovery in early 15th
century European nations have competed with each other to invade, colonize,
and annex nations and territories from the Americas to the west they cast
their net across the entire southern hemisphere to the small Oceanic islands
in the east.
Such was the rule of the "White Man's Burden" tasked divinely and
economically to civilize the savages and barbarians of the dark
continents.
From the map below one can easily see that the white man of the northern
hemisphere ruled, enslaved, and robbed the majority of the world's dark
populations of the southern hemisphere.
A French man, Alfred Sauvy in 1952 even coined a term for the dark
world:
the "Third World" as opposed to the western
"First" world and the Communist bloc nations, the "Second" world.
The term came into play during the Cold War.
THIRD WORLD

encompassing
the world's southern
hemisphere;

New Zealand.
"When the white man turns tyrant, it is
his own freedom that he destroys."
George Orwell, "Shooting an
Elephant"
Incredibly one can almost draw a straight line across the globe dividing the
rich powerful colonial powers of the northern hemisphere from the
impoverished weak colonized victims of the southern hemisphere
The white man's crusades against the dark continents have not stopped and
will never cease as long as the white man thinks himself as the superior
chosen race and sees the rest of humanity as pawns in a geopolitical
competitive chess game - to conquer, kill, move, alter, enslave, exploit,
and rob at will.
The most striking and evil example of western colonialism today is the
colonial racist existence
of Israel.
Russia's Invasion of
the Ukraine and the Limitless American Hypocrisy
Lies, Hypocrisy, Greed, and Force have been the modus operandi of all
powerful nations and empires throughout history.
As such, Truth and Justice have been an anathema to those who have the power
to prey upon the weak. Their might is right while their power lasts but
sooner or later they collapse while another power rises.
To the victor go the spoils.
"These plunderers of the world [the Romans],
after exhausting the land by their devastations, are rifling the ocean:
stimulated by avarice, if their enemy be rich; by ambition, if poor;
unsatiated by the East and by the West: the only people who behold
wealth and indigence with equal avidity.
To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under
false titles,
they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call
it peace".
Tacitus
Roman Senator and
Historian
A truer quote for the ages has not been said.
Today an ugly semblance of the Cold War has risen between East and West over
Russia's invasion of the Crimean Peninsula and eventually annexing it to
Russia.
Putin may fancy himself the modern Peter the
Great ever seeking to add territory to Russia and recreate the mother land
as a world power to be reckoned with. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union
the west has wrongfully mistreated and dismissed Russia as a minor player in
world affairs.
With NATO expanding eastward to Russia's border,
with America's establishment of new military bases in former Soviet
satellites, and the delayed placement of a missile defense system close to
Russia, no one can blame the Russians for feeling insecure and threatened by
the West.
Thus the annexation of Crimea can be directly
blamed on an arrogant miscalculation by the West.
The rhetoric used by western leaders in denounce Russia's action is
unhelpful and further inflaming the situation. Given that no military option
is contemplated quiet diplomacy is needed to defuse the situation.
The West must accept the finality of Crimea's annexation but it can
negotiate with Putin that Russia formally recognizes the Ukraine as an
independent state with the right to determine its future domestically and
internationally and Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine's border
and never establish military bases across from Ukraine's border.
Putin has made his point and won a small domestic and international victory
by annexing an impoverished Crimea that will be totally dependent on Russia
for its economic survival. Annexation will cost Russia greatly and hurt its
domestic economy.
Putin is obviously looking for a negotiated settlement and the West now has
the opportunity to pressure Russia not to threaten or invade any former
Communist nation in Eastern Europe. He may even accept the missile defense
system that U.S. wants to establish in the Czech Republic.
The U.N. could sponsor a negotiated settlement between Russia and Ukraine by
which Ukraine declares it accepts the "self determination" vote of the
Crimeans, no recognition of Crimea is needed. Naturally this will be for the
cause of peace and stability in the region. This then opens the door for
full negotiations between the west and Russia.
Putin could also be persuaded to be more forthcoming on
the Syrian and
Iranian front. Russia's economy will collapse if greater sanctions are put
in place.
Such a scenario will save the face of both sides and end the standoff. Any
western gloating would be counterproductive.
In the meantime, by what right, credibility, and moral authority can the
U.S., the most violent nation in history, attack anyone for illegal
invasions and violations of "international Law"?
Hello!! Remember
Iraq and Afghanistan...
What
of
Obama's Drone Wars in,
-
Africa
-
the Middle
East
-
Pakistan
-
Afghanistan
-
the Philippines?
The
United Nations in a report called such Drone Wars - ILLEGAL - due
to the high civilian casualties that result from such attacks and thus
violate International Law.
U.S. overthrows the Queen of
Hawaii
and Annexes the nation as the
fiftieth state.
Let's not go too far to see America's forceful
annexation of a nation - Hawaii, its fiftieth state.
U.S. and Europe's foreign policy can best be summed up as:
"Do as I say, Not as I do"
Without shame and moral credibility V.P.
Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, and former Secretary of
State
Hillary Clinton, despite their
accusations of Russia violating international law by invading a sovereign
nation, Crimea - ALL 3 Voted to invade IRAQ.
Please watch the video below on the Lies about Iraq that launched an illegal
and devastating war upon an innocent population resulting in the deaths of
One Million Iraqis.
So what do you do after the mass hysterical
propaganda that galvanized Congress and the American people to support an
invasion of Iraq, a war crime and crime against humanity, you declare
victory and leave, although there are tens of thousands of U.S. paid private
paramilitary personnel left along with an Embassy worth over $1 Billion.
The "war on terror" became a "terror war on the innocent".
The Coalition of the Killing massacred the innocent with impunity and no one
is ever held accountable. Today in the U.S. Iraq and Afghanistan are barely
on the radar screen.
The lives and livelihood of America's victims
from Latin America, to Africa,
to Asia are meaningless, insignificant, and unworthy of any memory or sense
of responsibility.
-
Neither the U.S. nor Russian here can
claim the high moral ground for both have a long history of invading
weaker nations, usually for economic greed.
-
Neither nation has a fundamental respect
for the sanctity of life of others nor for their basic human rights.
-
Both are criminal nations using their
superior military and nuclear power to intimidate and enforce their
national interests upon others
-
Both use their Veto power in the U.N.
Security Council to thwart each others interests.
With power comes impunity whether it's the U.S.,
the E.U., Russia, or Israel.
If any of these nations truly respected and adhered to International Law so
many of their murderous leaders would be in or have died in prison.

that God is just;
that his justice cannot sleep forever"
