In the alternative media we are known to cover
some very controversial and sensitive topics.
Many of us, myself included, normally prefer to
stay with topics like war, banking, genetically modified food and the
growing police state. These are all issues that are backed with mountains of
cold hard evidence. However, there are some other issues that are equally as
important, but far more difficult to bring up in the public arena.
One particular topic that is hotly debated in activist circles is the
depravity of the private lives led by those in power, such as
the British
Royal Family.
We know and understand that these people are
capable and obviously guilty of directing some of the most horrific acts of
violence seen on this planet, but all of this violence is most often carried
out through organizations and other people so they can maintain their
benevolent image.
Sadly, the reality and intentions of those in power is often far from
benevolent.
In almost every case of royalty and authority
across the planet, and throughout history, we have seen time after time that
those who lust for and hold power are driven to commit extreme acts of
violence and authoritarianism.
Even if mass murder and slavery were at one time
more socially acceptable, that does not change the moral injustice that has
taken place - and it does not excuse the crimes of these historical
aggressors.
Out of all of the bloodthirsty tyrannies in the world, the British Royal
Family is without a doubt the most vile, in terms of their global influence,
as well as their deep history of corruption and violence. If the native
populations slaughtered by the British crown in the past century were
tallied, there is no doubt in my mind that the body count would surpass that
of Stalin and Hitler combined.
The queen
holds over 1/6 of the worlds land, and
this territory was in no way acquired by peaceful or legitimate means.
We could even argue that the war crimes carried
out by British colonies like America and Israel are also a direct result of
the global policy that is handed down by the royal family and their cohorts
in the banking industry.
With all of this being the case people still have a hard time believing that
some really sick stuff may be happening behind the closed doors of those in
power.
There is plenty of evidence that makes the case for these kinds of
accusations, but because these people control the police, the media and the
entire public discourse, they are always able to sweep their crimes under
the rug.
One such controversy has presented itself in the first weeks of 2012, when
the
body of a teenage girl was found on the royal familys
private estate in Sandringham, Norfolk.
The media and the police are of course denying
that there is any evidence linking the royal family to the body and claiming
that any accusations at this point are purely circumstantial. However, they
seem to be overlooking the history of mysterious deaths surrounding the
royal family, as well as their involvement in human trafficking for the
purposes of torture and sex slavery.
One thing that I personally find very curious about this developing
storyline is that the victim here was not a local, but was in fact a woman
that was from Eastern Europe, thousands of miles from the royal estate.
The victim and a close friend were said to be
staying in a
migrant worker camp, in slave like conditions.
This is interesting because aristocratic elites with close ties to the Royal
Family have actually been convicted of importing sex slaves from various
areas of Eastern Europe.
The Royal Family has even been implicated by
many victims in this horrible kidnapping ring.
Last year, billionaire hedge fund manager and
close associate of the royal family,
Jeffrey Epstein, was charged with
various counts of kidnapping, pedophilia and human trafficking. Despite
damning evidence and multiple witness testimonies,
Epstein used his political pull and financial
resources to beat the case and get a minimal sentence.
Due to this controversy Prince Andrew took a lot of heat from the public, as
he was a very close friend of Epsteins and spent a whole lot of time with
him. Some victims in this case have even claimed that Epstein shared his
sex slaves with the Royal Family and would present them in the form of
gifts.
If we combine all of this information with the fact that
this is not the first time that a dead body
has mysteriously appeared on a royal estate in the past year, we have every
right to be suspicious. Whats worse is that the royal family enjoyed their
Boxing Day shoot,
just yards away from the crime scene, just
about a week before the body was discovered.
Now, Ill admit, this evidence wouldnt be enough to put someone away.
However, if you or I were implicated in a
similar situation, this evidence would without a doubt make us prime
suspects in the murder, and justify the search of our belongings and full
investigation into our activities.
Unfortunately, we do not yet live in a world where everyone is held to the
same standards, so people who have silly costumes and own a vast amount of
the planet will never even be looked at as potential suspects in a murder
case, even if a dead body appears of their front lawn.
So much can be said about the Royal Family, from
their relation to the historical Count Dracula,
to their involvement in human trafficking, to their support of the Nazi
regime.
Prince Harry has even been seen at parties
dressed like Hitler, complete with swastika patch and all:
As horrifying as all of this is, and as
important as it is that we know these things, it is also important to
understand that these transgressions are minor in comparison to the
institutionalized violence that this bloodline and others employ through
governments, corporations and multinational control systems such as
the
United Nations.
Joseph Stalin said,
"One death is a tragedy, one million is a
statistic."
This may not be true, but, sadly, this is how
people look at things.
So while the millions killed in
the Middle East
and elsewhere are a far greater crime than one body found on a royal estate,
this is a tragedy that is easier for people to wrap their minds around.
Therefore, digging deeper into this crime could
expose the overall sentiment of the elite and push the public dialogue about
war and oppression closer to reality.
Murder Probe Over Remains at...
Queen's Sandringham Estate
3 January 2012
from
BBC Website
Det. Ch. Insp. Jes Fry, of Norfolk Constabulary, said officers were
examining cold cases across the UK for potential links.
The force has confirmed the remains were that of a woman.
The woman's remains were
found on
the Queen's Sandringham
estate by a dog walker
A dog walker made the discovery at Anmer, near
King's Lynn, on New Year's Day. The area has been cordoned off. Police said
the identity of the woman was not yet known.
Detectives would not speculate on the age of the woman or comment on whether
the body was clothed.
Cold cases reviewed
"We are at the very early stages of the
investigation and it could be a complex inquiry," said Mr Fry.
"I cannot confirm whether she was clothed because, at the moment, only
my staff, the person who found the body and the person or people who put
it there know that - and I would like it to stay that way.
"The body has been in situ for some time but I can't comment on whether
that is weeks, months or years.
"The circumstances suggest this is a murder case and we are looking at
missing persons reports and cold cases, both locally and nationwide."
The body was found in a wooded area on farmland
at the 20,000-acre (8,000 hectare) royal estate.
Forensic tests
Forensic science experts are carrying out a detailed search of the area -
about a mile from the main gate to
Sandringham House.
Mr. Fry said it was not yet clear if the woman was killed at the scene or
taken there after her death. The body is expected to be recovered later and
taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in King's Lynn, where post-mortem
tests will take place.
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, along with the Earl and Countess of
Wessex, have been staying on the Sandringham Estate.
Buckingham Palace would not comment on the discovery, saying it was a
"matter for Norfolk police".
