Former Italian President Francesco Cossiga,
who revealed the existence of
Operation Gladio, has told Italy's oldest and
most widely read newspaper that the 9-11 terrorist attacks were run by the
CIA and Mossad, and that this was common knowledge among global intelligence
agencies.
In what translates awkwardly into English,
Cossiga told the newspaper Corriere della Sera:
"All the (intelligence services) of America
and Europeknow well that the disastrous attack has been planned and
realized from the Mossad, with the aid of the Zionist world in order to
put under accusation the Arabic countries and in order to induce the
western powers to take part in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Cossiga was elected president of the Italian
Senate in July 1983 before winning a landslide election to become president
of the country in 1985, and he remained until 1992.
Cossiga's tendency to be outspoken upset the Italian political
establishment, and he was forced to resign after revealing the existence of,
and his part in setting up,
Operation Gladio. This was a rogue intelligence
network under NATO auspices that carried out bombings across Europe in the
1960s, 1970s and '80s. Gladio's specialty was to carry out what they termed
"false flag" operations-terror attacks that were blamed on their domestic
and geopolitical opposition.
In March 2001, Gladio agent Vincenzo Vinciguerra stated, in sworn testimony,
"You had to attack civilians, the people,
women, children, innocent people, unknown people far removed from any
political game. The reason was quite simple: to force the public to turn
to the state to ask for greater security."
Cossiga first expressed his doubts about 9-11 in
2001, and is quoted by 9-11 researcher Webster Tarpley saying,
"The
mastermind of the attack must have been a sophisticated mind, provided with
ample means not only to recruit fanatic kamikazes, but also highly
specialized personnel. I add one thing: it could not be accomplished without
infiltrations in the radar and flight security personnel."
Coming from a widely respected former head of state, Cossiga's assertion
that the 9-11 attacks were an inside job and that this is common knowledge
among global intelligence agencies is illuminating. It is one more
eye-opening confirmation that has not been mentioned by America's propaganda
machine in print or on TV.
Nevertheless, because of his experience and
status in the world, Cossiga cannot be discounted as a crackpot.
