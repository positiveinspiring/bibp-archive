# Political Union In Europe - Governance Of, By, And For The Elite

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_globalelite163.htm

At the tail end of the week, a rather
curious event took place in Madrid.
Under the title "Project Europe", it
featured talks by a host of prominent Spanish, Portuguese and Italian
speakers, including the current prime ministers of Spain and Portugal,
Mariano Rajoy and Pedro Passos Coelho, and the recently
deposed Italian premier Enrico Letta.
The message from Southern Europes political
elite was as clear as it was unified:
the growth in "populism" - that
is, any political movement that opposes the continued expansion of
centralized power in Europe - represents a serious threat to the Unions
future.
To stymie its influence, concerted efforts
must be made to accelerate Europes march towards political union.
"We pro-Europeans are lacking a dream,"
said Letta.
"Others have one - to end the euro, to
break up the Union
We have lost ours. Before we had one. In 1984,
we had the four freedoms; in 1994, the euro; in 2004, Eastward
expansion. But what about now? Today we havent built any long-term
project of this kind. The dream must be political union."
Lettas sentiments were echoed by many of
his fellow speakers, including the events organizer, Nicolas
Berggruen.
A dual American and German citizen,
Berggruen is the billionaire founder and president of the private
investment company Berggruen Holdings and the Berggruen
Institute on Governance, a think tank that works on addressing
governance issues.
Berggruen is perhaps most famous for
refusing to buy or rent a house, instead choosing to divide his time
between some of the worlds most luxurious hotels as he trots the globe
snapping up companies to add to his impressive and highly lucrative
business empire.
He is a major shareholder and sits on the
board of Grupo Prisa, the holding group of El País, Spains
most widely read daily newspaper (a subject I wrote about here).
He is also a member of the grand-daddy of
U.S. political think tanks, the
Council of Foreign Relations.
Shaping Events in
Europe
In recent years Berggruen has carved out an
influential role in European politics, principally through his creation
of the
Council for the Future of Europe (CFR), a think tank whose
membership list reads like a veritable Whos Who of
transatlantic politics, business and finance.
Members include,
-
Tony Blair (for whom obviously no
introduction is needed)
-
Jacques Delors, a former president
of the European Commission
-
Mohamed Al Erian, the former CEO of
global investment management firm PIMCO
-
Pascal Lamy, a one-time director
general of the World Trade Organization
-
Romano Prodi, former Italian prime
minister and 10th president of the European Commission
-
Gerard Schroeder, a former
chancellor of Germany and current global manager for Rothschild
investment bank
-
Peter Sutherland, a former attorney
general of Ireland and long-standing chairman of Goldman Sachs
International
-
Axel Weber, a former president of
the Deutsche Bundesbank and now chairman of the board of Swiss
megabank UBS
A more impressive group of luminaries youd
be hard pressed to find anywhere in the world, with the obvious
exception of the CFR itself.
To lead them in their noble cause, Berggruen
appointed none other than Mario "Three Card" Monti, Goldman Sachs
former representative in Europe who all but admitted in a recent
television interview that his nomination to replace Berlusconi as
Italian prime-minister in 2011 amounted to a presidentially-blessed
government coup - one whose execution, as
Zero Hedge reports, stretched far beyond any constitutional powers
awarded to the president and which involved numerous foreign and
financial interests and conflicts thereof.
So, now that a clear picture is forming of
the caliber of personnel behind the Council for the Future of Europe,
what about its agenda?
To that end, we must turn to an article
Berggruen recently co-wrote with Nathan Gardels for the CFRs
flagship publication
Foreign Affairs:
The key to creating a federal Europe
with legitimate governing institutions is appropriate implementation
of the principle that Europeans already know as "subsidiarity," with
higher levels of government taking on only those functions and
responsibilities that cannot be fulfilled at a lower level.
The Berggruen Institute on Governances
Council for the Future of Europe has sought to address these issues
by gathering a small group of Europes most eminent and
experienced political figures to debate and design the institutions
that would govern a federal Europe and then plot a path forward,
step by step.
Granted, Berggruen and Gardels make a number
of interesting proposals for enhancing the democratic legitimacy of
Europes institutions - something that is clearly much needed.
These include,
-
the direct election of the
president of the European Commission by European citizens at large
-
the
holding of parliamentary elections based on Europe-wide lists instead of
national party lists
-
the transformation of the current European Council
into the upper house of the unions legislature
-
the strengthening
of the competencies of the European parliament by allowing it to
initiate legislation - a power currently enjoyed only by the unelected
Commission
However, they ignore one niggling little
detail:
namely, that democracy does not work by designing new structures
neither demanded nor accepted by the public.
And there is nothing to
indicate that most EU publics support the idea of being integrated into
a fully federal EU political entity.
On the contrary, as a recent poll by
Pew Global has shown, support for and trust in the EU is declining
precipitously across both core and peripheral EU Member States. In
austerity-hit Spain and Greece, support is now well below 50 percent.
In Britain, only 43 percent of the
population view the EU favorably, while in France its even lower, at
41 percent - down from 60 percent in 2012.
The Rise of
"Populism"
This trend has predictably fuelled growing
nationalism and euro skepticism in many countries.
The result has been a
surge in support of formerly fringe political parties, such as,
-
Marie Le
Pens Front National
-
Nigel Farages UK Independence Party
-
Jörg
Haiders Austrian Freedom Party
It is these parties whom the European elite
scornfully label as "populists".
In a recent interview with the Catalan
daily La Vanguardia, the European Commissioner Vivianne Reding
played down fears of their potential impact in Brussels:
After these elections, 30 percent of
parliament may be held by groups on the extreme left or right. But they
will only make lots of fragmented noise. Those on the extreme right hate
each other anyway.
Meanwhile, in the middle the big core of Christian
democrats, socialists, social democrats, and greens will continue
working discretely to build Europe.
And they wonder why we, the people, are
disenchanted with European politics. Among many other things, it is this
blatant disregard for plurality - an essential cornerstone of any
self-respecting democracy - that continues to erode trust in European
institutions.
Thats not to defend in any way the more
rabidly right-wing movements that are popping up, once again, throughout
Europe; rather, it is to highlight the vital need to understand the
causes of the anger and indignation that are providing such fertile
ground for their growth - before they become a genuine threat.
Unfortunately, the European elite is, as
always, in little mood for soul-searching or listening to the "little
people" of Europe.
It will instead fire out salvo after salvo of empty
words and slogans, as it retreats further and further behind the
protective screen of Europes mainstream political parties - the
bought-and-paid-for center left and center right parties to which Reding
referred.
After the bitter experience of France, Holland, and Ireland
there will no more referendums or other forms of popular consultation.
With or without the consent of the people of
Europe, Europes elite seeks to completely redraw the continents
political and economic map. And as they take the countries of Europe,
both ancient and young, closer and closer towards an arranged political
marriage of their convenience, the old continents
centuries-old tradition of representative democracy lies precariously in
the balance.
If political union is consummated, power
will be further concentrated and shifted upwards and away from the
common man, as the core essence of democracy is mercilessly gutted.
Its
outward appearance will no doubt be preserved for posterity, as happened
in tyrannical regimes throughout modern history.
Elections will still be
held, votes will be cast, some may even be counted, but as UK
conservative MEP and leading populist Daniel Hannan recently said in this
stirring speech, democracy is not just "a periodic right to mark a
cross on a ballot paper":
[It] depends on an affinity between the
governing and the governed; a sense of common identity, of
allegiance, of nationhood. You need a demos, a unit with
which we identify when we use the word "We".
We have that sense as
Britons, as Germans, as Portuguese. We do not have it as Europeans,
and when you take the demos out of democracy, you are left
only with the kratos; with the power of a system that must
compel by law what it dare not ask in the name of civic patriotism.
