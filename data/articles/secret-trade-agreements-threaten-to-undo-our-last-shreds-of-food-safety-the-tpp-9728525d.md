# Secret Trade Agreements Threaten to Undo Our Last Shreds of Food Safety - 
The TPP

You could soon be
eating
imported seafood, beef
or chicken products
that dont meet even
basic U.S. food safety standards.
If you think the U.S. government is doing a
sub-par job of keeping your food safe, brace yourself.
You could soon be eating imported seafood,
beef or chicken products that dont meet even basic U.S. food safety
standards. Under two new trade agreements, currently in negotiation, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could be powerless to shut down
imports of unsafe food or food ingredients.
And if it tries, multinational corporations
will be able to sue the U.S. government for the loss of anticipated
future profits.
More frightening? Negotiations for both
agreements are taking place behind closed doors, with input allowed
almost exclusively from the corporations and industry trade groups that
stand to benefit the most.
And the Obama Administration intends to push
the agreements through Congress without so much as giving lawmakers
access to draft texts, much less the opportunity for debate.
Designed to grease the wheels of world
commerce, the
Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
(TTIP) and
the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
would force the U.S. and other participating countries to harmonize
food safety standards.
That means all countries that sign on to the
agreement would be required to abide by the lowest common denominator
standards of all participating governments. So for instance, say Vietnam
allows higher residues of veterinary antibiotics in seafood than the
U.S. allows, and Vietnam and the U.S. both sign on to the TPP.
As a trade partner, the U.S. could be forced
to lower its standards to allow for imports of seafood from Vietnam - or
face a lawsuit by the seafood exporter for depriving the company of
future sales of its products in the U.S.
The U.S. has already had a taste of this
type of policy under the
North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA).
In 2005, the Canadian Cattlemen for Fair
Trade
sued the U.S. government for banning imports of beef and live
Canadian cattle after a case of mad cow disease was discovered in
Canada. In the end, the U.S. prevailed, but not until it had spent
millions to defend itself in court.
Mexico wasnt so fortunate when three
companies (Corn Products International, ADM/Tate & Lyle and Cargill)
sued the Mexican government for preventing imports of high fructose corn
syrup. Mexico lost all three cases, and was forced to pay out a total of
$169.18 million to the three firms.
Among the many gifts to Big Ag contained in
the TTIP and TPP?
Back-door
entry for their
genetically modified seeds and crops.
Countries,
including those in the European Union, could find it increasingly
difficult to ban, or even require the labeling of, genetically modified
organisms (GMOs), if biotech companies determine that those countries
strict policies restrict fair trade and infringe on the companies
rights to profit.
The TTIP and the TPP are, individually and
combined, two of the largest free trade agreements in world history.
According to the
Citizens Trade Campaign (CTC) the TPP alone covers 40 percent of the
global economy. That percentage will likely grow, because the agreement
allows for other countries, besides the 12 currently involved, to dock
on after the agreement is in place.
Both the TTIP and TPP could have dangerous
consequences for food safety in the U.S., and around the world. But
theyre not limited to food or agriculture policy. Both also contain
sweeping policies that could affect everything from the environment and
sustainability, to healthcare, Internet freedom and the financial
markets.
Given the potential of these agreements to
shape global policy on so many fronts, its reasonable to assume that
negotiators would actively solicit, and take into careful consideration,
input from the affected parties, including consumers, farmers and
governments. Instead theyve taken the opposite approach.
From day one,
negotiations for the TTIP and TPP have been shrouded in secrecy.
The public and participating governments,
including the U.S. Congress, have been shut out of the negotiating
process, denied access to everything from early proposals to final draft
texts.
Why the secrecy? The
Obama Administration
wants as little public debate as possible, so it can ram the agreements
through Congress using something called Fast Track.
Fast Track, a product of the Nixon presidency, strips Congress of
its authority to control the content of a trade deal and hands that
authority over to the executive branch. Congress gets a vote, but only
after the negotiations have been completed, and the agreements have been
signed.
No debate. No amendments. Just a fast, forced vote, too late for
Congress to have any influence.
According to the
CTC, two-thirds of Democratic freshmen in the U.S. House of
Representatives have expressed serious reservations about the TPP
negotiations and the prospect of giving Fast Track authority to the
President. And more than 400 organizations representing 15 million
Americans have already
petitioned Congress to do away with Fast Track in favor of a more
democratic approach to trade agreement negotiations.
So far those pleas have fallen on deaf ears.
If the public is shut out, and Congress gets
no say, who gets a seat at the table? Corporations. Thats right. The
Obama Administration is trusting corporations like Dow AgroSciences,
Cargill and DuPont, and trade groups like the Pork Producers Council and
Tobacco Associates, Inc., to write food safety policies.
In all, more than
600 corporations
have been given access to drafts of various chapters of the TPP.
Requests for the same level of access, from members of Congress and from
the public, have been denied.
No wonder then that, according to leaked
drafts obtained by groups like,
...the TPP contains proposals designed to
give transnational corporations special rights that go far beyond
those possessed by domestic businesses and American citizens,
says Arthur Stamoulis, executive director of the CTC.
Experts who have reviewed the leaked texts
say that TPP negotiators propose allowing transnational corporations to
challenge countries laws, regulations and court decisions, including
environmental and food safety laws.
Corporations will be allowed to resolve
trade disputes in special international tribunals. In other words, they
get to do an end run around the countries domestic judicial systems,
effectively wiping out hundreds, if not more, domestic and international
food sovereignty laws.
U.S. consumers arent the only ones who
should be up in arms about these trade agreements, the secrecy around
their negotiations, and the Obama Administrations intent to fast-track
them. Under the TTIP and TPP, consumers in countries that have stricter
food safety regulations than those in the U.S. will see their standards
lowered, too.
For instance, Japan prohibits the use of
peracetic acid to sterilize vegetables, fruits and meat, while the U.S.,
Canada and Australia allow it.
Japans health ministry, in anticipation of
the TPP, has
said the country will add the acid to its approved list. In all,
Japan has approved only about 800 food additives, to the more than 3,000
approved in the U.S.
Japans consumers could soon see a sudden reversal
of laws enacted to protect their health.
European consumers will also suffer. Europe
has long used the precautionary principle to ban
ractopamine in meat,
chlorine rinses of poultry and the use of
rBGH
growth hormone in milk production.
Under the TTIP, Europe could be
forced to allow all three in order to meet the lowest common denominator
rule. The precautionary principle removes the burden of proof from
policymakers, allowing them to make discretionary decisions in
situations where there is the possibility of harm, given the lack of
scientific proof to the contrary.
But that principle flies out the window
under TTIP rules.
The Organic Consumers Association is urging
consumers to
petition President Obama and Interim U.S. Trade Representative
Miriam Sapiro to release the draft texts of the TTIP and TPP, and
encourage full and open debate on the policies contained in both
agreements.
The petition also asks President Obama to
end
the Fast Track option, and grant Congress the ability to debate and
amend the agreements, before voting on them.
With the worlds food supply, and consumers
health, already
endangered by chemical-intensive industrial agriculture
and climate change, the U.S. and other governments should be looking for
ways to promote sustainable food and agriculture policies, not restrict
governments abilities to do so.
Instead, the Obama Administration is
subverting the principles of democracy in favor of handing a few
transnational corporations unprecedented power to put profits above the
health and well being of consumers.
