Dr. Martin Blank, PhD of Colombia University leads a group of concerned scientists in an important appeal about the safety of Wi-Fi and other electromagnetic signals.
To put it bluntly, these devices are causing cell damage and ending many of our lives prematurely, and these scientists want you to know about it.
"The time to deal with the harmful biological and health effects is long overdue. To protect our children, ourselves and our ecosystem, we must reduce exposure by establishing more protective guidelines."
Dr. Blank is representing 190 international scientists in an Appeal to the UN, UN Member States and the WHO on the risks of electromagnetic fields emitted by telecommunications and utility technologies.
