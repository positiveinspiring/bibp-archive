Following
China's unwillingness to vote against Russia at the UN
and yesterday's news that
China will sue Ukraine for $3bn loan repayment,
it seems Russia is returning the favor.
Speaking at the Chinese Economic
Development Forum,
ITAR-TASS reports, the Chief Economist of
Russia's largest bank stated that,
"China's Yuan may become the third reserve currency in the in the
future."
Managing Director and Chief Economist of
investment company Sberbank Yevgeny Gavrilenkov said at the 15th
governmental Chinese economic development forum in the Chinese capital on
Sunday (via ITAR-TASS):
"Chinas
yuan (renminbi) may become a third reserve currency in the world in the
future"
"This forecast can be made on figures
of domestic economic growth. Probably the country will keep high GDP
growth rate and the GDP volume will increase to around 14-16 trillion
U.S. dollars for a brief period of time, the indicators
comparable to the
European Union and the United States.
Meanwhile,
Chinese securities are more attractive for the countries that have a
surplus in economy, particularly the Middle East states; and
China will obviously follow the path of securing the countrys assets,"
The forum which opened in the Chinese capital on
March 22 discusses a broad range of issues of economic reforms and
Chinas stronger role as the second largest
world economy.
First Deputy Prime Minister of the Chinese State
Council Zhang Gaoli, Managing Director of the International Monetary
Fund Christine Lagarde and top managers of major world corporations
participate in the forum as honorary guests.
Of course, as we noted previously,
nothing lasts forever...
...and with
Friday's "Petrodollar Alert"
perhaps things are moving faster than many assumed.
