As Indignant protests enter
second month,
opinions divided about nature
and future of the movement
It's past midnight in Syntagma Square, the
epicenter of Greece's month-long anti-austerity demonstrations, and
Stathis Marinos is sitting at a corner cafe overlooking the colorful
tent city under the trees.
Flipping a string of worry beads while sipping a
frappe, the 37-year-old software engineer muses about Greece's financial
crisis.
The memorandum is unsustainable, he says
of the loan deal signed last year between the socialist government of
George Papandreou and Greece's foreign creditors to avert default.
He
thinks the debt-choked country is being stifled by a mix of brutally
rigid measures - and that they must be resisted.
But you cannot use the
system to fight the system. You must not get caught up in this process,
he says, criticizing calls among protesters and pundits to declare the
bailout agreement unconstitutional.
A few yards away, in the heart of the white
marble square, a loudspeaker crackles with rhetorical din from the ongoing
session at the makeshift assembly meeting.
Modeled after Spain's
Indignados who took over Madrid's Puerta del Sol and other public squares
earlier this year, Athens's aganaktismenoi (Indignants) have camped in the
capital's main square since May 25.
A month after the first call on Facebook
and other social media, Syntagma, or Constitution square, the starting point
to the capital's main commercial street, is playing host to a postmodern
incarnation of the ancient Athenian agora.
Every evening, hundreds of people gather here to discuss anything and
everything about the crisis.
Speakers, who are chosen by lot, are given a
two-minute time limit so as to allow for the greatest possible number of
contributions. There is little of the typical booing and hissing, and
audiences react mostly with hand gestures: waving their hands in the air for
approval or giving a thumbs down when they disagree.
Interpretations of what
is happening in the square range from the groundbreaking to the delusional
or just plain silly.
This is not a movement - and it will by no
means evolve into a political party. It's more like a trend, says
Marinos, who has joined in every evening after work since day one. He
has often taken part in street demos, but points out that he has never
belonged to a political party.
It's great that people familiarize
themselves with the political process; they learn how to engage in
dialogue with each other; how to participate in civic life, he says of
the meetings.
In the beginning, the Indignants were mostly
portrayed as a non-political grouping. It was in the wake of a mass
demonstration earlier this month that Greece's mainstream parties, PASOK and
the right-of-center New Democracy, came close to clinching a unity coalition
deal.
Talks eventually fell through and Papandreou went on to conduct a
cabinet reshuffle designed to galvanize his base. He also proposed a
referendum in the fall on a proposal to revise the Greek Constitution.
The
fact that the Indignants have put pressure on the government and the
politicians, some argue, means that they have now become political.
Political animals
In fact, some analysts maintain, the movement has been political from the
start.
Costas Douzinas, a law professor at Birkbeck, University of London,
recently penned one of the most flattering profiles of the Indignants in
Britains The Guardian newspaper, after being invited to speak in Syntagma.
For him,
this is the most political movement we have
had in Greece, and perhaps in Europe for the past 20 years. It is
totally political and in a way it changes our understanding of what
politics means, he says.
He is not alone.
Vassiliki Georgiadou, a
political science professor at Panteion University in Athens, has kept a
close eye on the demographics of the square.
All findings so far, she says,
indicate that we are dealing with a politically active audience.
These people are deeply disaffected and
disillusioned with politicians, with the political parties and with the
institutions at large, she explains.
Their reaction was not a bolt out of the
historical blue.
Most research shows that people's disaffection
with Greece's social and political institutions dates back to the early
1990s. A public survey published last year found that nearly nine out of 10
Greeks are dissatisfied with how democracy works.
The local media, which have suffered their own
barrage of criticism (some of it fair) as sycophants of the status quo, like
to describe the movement in emotional rather than ideological terms.
But frustration is not merely an emotional
reaction. Frustration is the preamble of political protest, says
Georgiadou.
Any kind of politics of resistance starts
from a refusal. Refusal is the first step in any process of eventual
political confrontation, Douzinas says.
The phenomenon seems to have a dream-come-true
quality for some, and Douzinas is certainly happy to connect the dots.
Without people being in a space, taking it
over and declaring their refusal of whatever it is that they want to
reject, no radical change has ever taken place in history, he says.
Skeptics, on the other hand, maintain that the
memorandum is not at the root of the problem, but only a symptom.
Culminating to the memorandum, they say, the trail has been one of
dysfunction, waste and corruption. Writing in The Guardian last week, author
Apostolos Doxiadis attacked the charlatans who blame the evil foreigners
for our own ills and failures.
Some soul-searching would instead be more
appropriate, he reckons.
I know that the heart of our problem is a
huge, parasitic and inefficient public sector, which EU funds, unwisely
and often corruptly distributed by our politicians over the past two
decades, made even bigger and less productive, he writes.
When it comes to self-criticism and proposals to
overcome the crisis, detractors say, the Syntagma folk are uncomfortably
laconic.
Far form being the frontline of any kind of
solid movement, the Syntagma camp-in is a confused, depoliticized,
borderline-petulant response to the economic crisis, writes Brendan
O'Neill, editor of spiked website, in The Australian.
He is annoyed at the absence of any serious
debate about the hard stuff.
Save their vociferous opposition to austerity
measures,
absolutely nothing of substance is
proposed, he writes.
What virtually everyone agrees on is that Greece
is a mess.
Faced with bankruptcy, the country received a
110-billion-euro rescue package from the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund in May 2010 but now needs a second bailout of a
similar size to meet its financial obligations until the end of 2014, when
it hopes for a return to capital markets for funding. International
creditors have set the introduction of a painful raft of belt-tightening
measures - including tax hikes, spending cuts and privatizations - as a
condition for releasing more aid.
A critical vote is to be held in Parliament on
June 29 and 30. Meanwhile, unemployment has soared to 16 percent and crime,
in what used to be one of the safest states in Europe, is on the rise.
Anti-immigrant sentiment, particularly in the
poorer neighborhoods of the capital, is spreading as once-marginal
xenophobic groups are establishing a mainstream presence.
Square feat
Nicos Mouzelis, an emeritus sociology professor at the London School of
Economics, goes as far as to draw parallels between the Indignants and the
anti-globalization demonstrations in Seattle and Genoa - and, in a more
far-fetched comparison, the events of May 1968.
Mouzelis, a former adviser to reformist Prime
Minister Costas Simitis, praises the movement's,
great dynamism, spontaneity and the rapid,
widespread diffusion across all social strata.
The protests have truly brought together a very
diverse crowd - but one that is not always pulling in exactly the same
direction.
Browsing through the crowd massed in the square, you encounter a motley crew
of leftists railing against global capitalism and neoliberalism. Posters of
Che Guevara hang next to used tear gas canisters (with Made in USA labels)
launched by police during the recent riots. The spicy fumes wafting from the
assorted stands of hot-dog vendors occasionally mixes with the pungent odor
of marijuana.
At the assembly, people discuss the negative
effects of Europe's Common Agricultural Policy on Greek farmers before
talking through some organizational issues. With time, the discourse at the
meetings has become more progressive and assertive. A recent resolution
called for activist-style interventions like the occupation of television
stations and public buildings.
For Marinos, some degree of radicalization is a
natural evolution.
You cannot make an omelette without
breaking eggs, he says.
The Indignants' decision to cordon off the
Parliament building on June 15 to prevent lawmakers from reviewing the
controversial midterm fiscal plan was widely regarded as the first break
with the movement's non-violent stance.
The rally, which was also attended by thousands
of union members, degenerated into violence as riot police battled with
self-styled anarchists for hours. Then came the usual finger-pointing
squabble over who deserves the blame for the violence.
A decision to give the movement a more activist
orientation, some analysts say, would most likely alienate the big mass of
supporters.
Some people would like to see a fallback to
traditional practices. But I am not sure that many people will want to
follow, Georgiadou says.
Interestingly, however, developments in and
around Syntagma Square have thrown left-wing parties - like the Greek
Communist Party (KKE) and the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) - into
disarray.
Early skepticism - the more sclerotic KKE went as far as to
condemn the movement for not being class-driven - gradually gave way to,
some say, cynical attempts to hijack the movement.
They are unlikely to succeed, as most protesters
view them as part of the problem.
If KKE changes, it will destroy itself,
Marinos says.
Dogs of war
Just up the steps from the assembly, in front of the illuminated Parliament
building, a different group is chanting slogans and hurling insults against
the,
thieving politicians who destroyed Greece,
calling them to give the money back and get the f*** out of the
country.
Demonstrators make the disparaging open-palm
moutza gesture against the House and point green laser beams - sold here
by immigrant street vendors - at television crews conveniently positioned on
the balconies of the Grande Bretagne luxury hotel.
Mock gallows and banners taunting Papandreou as
being Goldman Sachs's employee of the year decorate this part of the
square.
Most of the acid is flung at Theodoros Pangalos, the corpulent
deputy prime minister and father of the infamous
we-all-ate-the-money-together comment.
Here, in this more colorful part of the new
agora, is where you are most likely to bump into Loukanikos, the famous riot
dog, and manic street preacher and cult TV personality Eleni Louka yelling
repent into a megaphone as bystanders take snapshots with their cell
phones.
The rowdy behavior and nationalist overtones of the people stationed in
front of the House have caused occasional spats with their left-leaning
counterparts down the steps.
I don't understand what is going on down
there, Giorgos, a young man in blue jeans and a polo t-shirt, tells me
while rolling a cigarette. I don't have a solution to the crisis. All I
know is that I am angry with all this, he says.
The blanket rejectionism and often xenophobic
posturing of those upstairs conveys a sense of uncertainty, of lost bearings
perhaps, in a world swept up by rapid social change.
Elias Maglinis, a writer and journalist in his early 40s who lives in the
nearby Mets area, is put off by some of the crass behavior.
The gallows, the comparisons to the 1967
military coup and the slogans that the dictatorship did not end in 1973
make me angry. These people have no memory or do not know what a
dictatorship or firing squad means, he says.
At 1 a.m., the protest has petered out.
About 50
people remain scattered on the sidewalk of Amalias Avenue in front of the
House. Some lean over the newly installed railings to
taunt the baton-wielding policemen. Two middle-aged men, beer cans in hand,
chat with a police chief.
A towering figure with a white mustache, the
soft-spoken chief expresses his sympathy for the demonstrators.
We also are suffering, he says pointing at
his men. My salary was slashed; I am the father of three. We are here
to protect the House, not them [the deputies], he says.
Police officers, currently paid between 800 and
1,500 Euros, are in for wage cuts like all civil servants.
As he speaks, fireworks explode overhead as the
Panathenaic stadium, the venue that hosted the first modern Olympic Games,
prepares to host the Special Olympics opening ceremony.
What next?
Most analysts predict that the Indignant movement will fizzle out.
Because these movements reject any linkages
to political parties, trade unions and other well-established
organizations, they do not last long, says Mouzelis.
But the long-term impact on Greece's political
culture must not be discounted.
Politicians will not be able to operate 'as
usual' anymore, he says.
And even if the hype about direct democracy in
action is exaggerated, recent developments have made people realize that
they can be active citizens without belonging to any particular party or
trade union.
A democracy should welcome the existence of
active citizens; it's not something to be afraid of. After all, it's
better if people get together in public squares than becoming numbed
couch potatoes, Georgiadou says.
Back in the square, the assembly is voting on
the resolutions proposed over the course of the day.
Attendants vote in favor of organizing concerts
on a daily basis, but reject a proposal to invite the country's premier for
talks. Decisions will soon be posted on the real-democracy website. Most of
them dictate actions to be taken during the two-day general strike on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
Ambling over to the crowd, Marinos says that what happens during the strike
may well determine the future of the movement. He ponders the Marfin bank
tragedy in May last year.
Three employees died when the premises were
firebombed during an anti-austerity rally.
Should there be human losses like then, the
whole thing will die.
