The February and March 2001 issues of Harper's Magazine feature a series by Christopher Hitchens on the case for charging Kissinger with War Crimes.
The making of a war criminal An extensive section on East Timor Christopher Hitchens' Trial of Henry Kissinger -A Review by Mike McGlothlin http://www.spectacle.org/0501/kissinger.html Hitchens presents a rather straightforward argument that establishes two seemingly undeniable propositions: on at least one occasion, Henry K. conspired to commit murder, and that on numerous other occasions, Henry K. was the primary force behind certain acts that could quite plausibly be considered war crimes. The case for Henry K. as murder conspirator is what Hitchens calls a "lay-down" case, i.e., one that stands out for its clear facts and clear law. The murder victim is General Rene Schneider, who was the Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army, whom Hitchens misidentifies as the Chilean "Chief of Staff."; According to Hitchens (and the 09 September, 1970 minutes of the "40" Committee, the Kissinger chaired secret panel that oversaw U.S. covert operations), the Chilean military had a strong tradition of neutrality in political affairs, a rarity on the South American continent. General Schneider was known as an officer committed to upholding the Chilean constitution and therefore opposed to the rumored incipient coup against newly elected Socialist President Salvador Allende by a right wing would-be junta of current and former Chilean military officers. Using U.S. Government communications cables from the CIA and documents from the State Department, and White House, Hitchens relates the facts of Kissinger's direct involvement in the direction, planning, financing, and general support by the organs of the U.S. Government in the plot to remove General Schneider.

The Pornography of Power
TOBY HARNDEN, TELEGRAPH, LONDON
Washington reacted furiously to a request by Chilean judges for Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, to answer questions about an American journalist killed during the 1973 coup in Chile.
A Bush administration official condemned the Chilean supreme court decision to send questions to Dr Kissinger, saying the move increased unease about the proposed International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.
The administration source said:
"It is unjust and ridiculous that a distinguished servant of this country should be harassed by foreign courts in this way."
The danger of the ICC is that, one day, US citizens might face arrest abroad and prosecution as a result of such politically motivated antics.
"...In its ruling, Chile's supreme court said a list of questions should be sent to the US supreme court with regard to Dr Kissinger's knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the death of Charles Horman, a journalist arrested by troops loyal to General Augusto Pinochet. His body was identified in a mortuary weeks later... The Chilean order came less than two months after French detectives delivered a court summons to Dr Kissinger, who was visiting Paris, asking him to testify about the disappearance of French nationals in Chile... In another case, a judge in Argentina has ordered Dr Kissinger to testify in a human-rights trial about a 1970s plan by South American governments to kidnap and kill Left-wing critics. [news/2001/08/01] The US involvement in coup planning began even before Allende's election victory, under the code-name FUBELT, with action plans prepared for Kissinger's consideration. One group of officers working under CIA direction carried out the assassination of General Rene Schneider, a pro-Allende officer, in an unsuccessful attempt to spark a full-scale coup before Allende could take office. Can Henry Kissinger be Extradited? He serves his consulting firm, Kissinger Associates, serves as a sort of private National Security Adviser and Secretary of State to about 30 major corporations around the world, such as, American Express Freeport-McMoRan Minerals Chase Manhattan Bank Volvo Walter Isaacson on Booknotes

Walter Isaacson on Booknotes
According to the new book "Kissinger," by Walter Isaacson, published in 1992 (page 733) had a contract or project arrangement with Henry Kissingers money-making consulting firm, Kissinger Associates, in 1990.
According to this fascinating book, Kissinger started his consultancy in July 1982 with,
$350,000 lent to him by Goldman Sachs and a consortium of three other banks.
Some of the people Kissinger hired to work for him were Brent Scowcroft, former national security adviser, and Lawrence Eagleburger,
who was lured aboard as president in June 1984 after serving as undersecretary of state.
Both Snowcroft and Eagleburger left Kissinger Associates in 1989 to join President Bushs administration. Kent Associates is a subsidiary of Kissinger Associates.
On pages 733-734 a list of some of Kissingers corporate clients include, aside from ABB:
Shearson Lehman Hutton Atlantic Richfield Banca Nazionale del Lavora (BNL) a Rome bank that made illegal loans to Iraq Fluor Hunt Oil Merck & Co. Union Carbide
