# The Three Industries that Love the TPP - Hollywood, Big Pharma and Wall 
Street

Tons of people seem (quite
rightly) concerned about the Trans Pacific
Partnership (TPP)
agreement.
As we pointed out last week
after the final text was finally, released, the
agreement has a lot of
really big problems. But if you want to understand
just how bad the agreement is, perhaps you should just
look at the industries that like it.
Vox notes that
Big Pharma and Hollywood love the agreement while
The Intercept notes that
Wall Street loves it.
It should be noted that, actually, Big Pharma is
apparently a bit 'disappointed' that
the TPP doesn't go far enough in
locking up exclusivity for biologics.
That said, talk about three of the most hated industries
around:
But, more
importantly, talk about three of the most protectionist,
anti-free trade industries around.
We've been repeating over
and over again that
the TPP is not a free trade deal and this should be
more confirmation.
Hollywood, Big Pharma and
Wall Street are probably three of the biggest industries
to rely heavily on government regulations as a way to,
And they like the deal.
That's because it's not a free trade deal at all. It's
not about "taking away" barriers to trade, it's about
building bigger barriers in the form of
protectionism to protect big, legacy industries from
innovation and competition.
Of course, it's no surprise
that Hollywood, Big Pharma and Wall Street are also
three of the most powerful lobbying industries in
Washington DC, because when you can no longer innovate,
and you rely on government protectionism, you focus your
efforts on "political entrepreneurship" - better known
as getting the government to protect you from real
entrepreneurship.
So, no wonder the USTR
(United States Trade Representative -
Michael Froman) went this
direction. They only hear from these kinds of
industries, and the end result is a fake free trade
agreement that is designed to do the exact opposite.
It's designed to build up barriers to protect old,
stodgy industries who have relied on protection from
competition from decades, and don't want to see that
dissolve against foreign competition.
