"We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years."
He went on to explain:
"It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The super-national sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries"
-attributed to David Rockefeller at the June 1991 Bilderberger meeting in Baden Baden, Germany
(a meeting also attended by then-Governor Bill Clinton and by Dan Quayle)
Bilderberg is driven by the systems methodology.
This is the methodology satirized in The Report from Iron Mountain and Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars. This latter in particular is a direct and deliberate indictment of Bilderberg.
Of the former, Henry Kissinger wrote,
"Whoever wrote it is an idiot."
The system paradigm, in a nutshell, is the precept that one can effectively control the future by a two step process:
analyzing the present into primitive components and their interrelations architecting a strategy of selective manipulation, reconstruction, introduction, and abolition, of components and interrelations
analyzing the present into primitive components and their interrelations
architecting a strategy of selective manipulation, reconstruction, introduction, and abolition, of components and interrelations
Strictly speaking, this methodology is the most effective of any - though if applied unwisely or maliciously, it is also the most destructive and pernicious. Problems - grave problems - arise in three principal areas:
accurate, precise, thorough ascertainment of what the components and the interrelations are, the choice of goal, and the development of an implementation strategy.
accurate, precise, thorough ascertainment of what the components and the interrelations are,
the choice of goal, and
the development of an implementation strategy.
Total accuracy, precision, and thoroughness of analysis are impossible with any system of more than modest complexity.
Societies of humans are, of course, of far more than modest complexity. Systematicians tend to underestimate the complexity of natural systems, and overestimate their capacity to accommodate complexity, both in analysis and in architecture. In particular, based on an undefendable presumption of rigor of analysis, and due to mistaken ascertainment of human nature, they develop architectures that include components and relations of rigor and regimentation, where chaos-tolerant components and relations of suggestion and flexibility are requisite. Social and economic systematicians, being institutional academics as a rule, often choose and accept goals that are noxious, particularly when the system includes people. And, often through no deliberate intent, the architectures they develop cause disastrous collateral damage, wreaking havoc on human autonomy and conflicting wildly with the prerequisites of individual human fulfillment. An old clich√© is an apt caution for all systematicians and those subject to their machinations: A little knowledge is far more dangerous than none at all. Bilderberg is where the top conspirators broadly effect implementation of their architecture. It is ground zero for practical conspirator coordination. The conspirator systematicians exhibit all the ills detailed above. In particular, the goal they accept is perpetuation of the existing power structure. This goal is inimical to humanity, and particularly noxious to its brightest and most inventive members.
In one of those examples of happenstance that smack of fate, the chief conspirator architect - Henry Kissinger - has the initials HAK. Using data assembled by Tony Gosling, I have done a simple analysis of attendance at Bilderberg,
99 (Hotel Caesar Park Penha Longa, Sintra, Portugal) 98 (Turnberry, Ayrshire, Scotland) 97 (Pine Isle resort, Lake Lanier, near Atlanta, Georgia, USA) 96 (CIBC Leadership Centre, Toronto, Canada) 95 (Zurich, Switzerland)

96 (CIBC Leadership Centre, Toronto, Canada)
95 (Zurich, Switzerland)
The nucleus of power obviously is the set of people who attended all of them - these are the people Bilderberg is built around. I separately list people who attended four of the five meetings, and end with a list of curious attendees who arent regulars.
David Rockefeller is notable in his habitual attendance not only of Bilderberg, but of CFR and TLC gatherings, making it obvious that he is indeed the Chairman of the Board of the World.
Hidden behind the scenes is the House of Rothschild, which nonetheless does make personal Bilderberg appearances. My guess is that Sir Evelyn de Rothschild (Chairman, N M Rothschild & Sons - nmrothschild.co.uk) and perhaps some other Rothschilds set the covert agenda for each Bilderberg meeting, and have final say on who will attend in a given year, and David Rockefeller mediates their agenda, though Henry Kissinger may also act as a direct mediator.
Carrington likely has much direct involvement in auditing prospective invitees.
The Chairman - Peter Carrington, until 2000 when Etienne Davignon assumed the chairmanship - is the one who actually sends the invitations. The Advisory Group, Steering Committee, and Honorary Secretaries-General, nominally recommend attendees, but in practice this is not quite how things work. Conrad Black brags (or confesses, depending on ones point of view) that
"After 1986, I became the co-leader of the Canadian group and effectively chose most of the Canadian participants."
Presumably,
Agnelli "effectively" chooses the Italian participants Balsemao the Portuguese Barnevik the Swedish Davignon the Belgian Hoegh the Norwegian Halberstadt the Dutch Olechowski the Polish de Pury the Swiss Schrempp the German Seidenfaden the Danish Sutherland the Irish Vranitzky the Austrian Collomb the French David the Greek Carvajal Urquijo the Spanish Wolfensohn, all those not otherwise included

Selection of US and UK participants is clearly more complicated. One might assume that those officially designated as "representatives" ("REP" in the lists) would be the ones that choose participants from their respective nations, but this is clearly not the case, considering that Black is not a "representative." Status as a representative is likely indicative of a person tending to organizational and reporting responsibilities specific to his nation.
The Steering Committee ("STEERING") consists of four people responsible for more general administrative and organizational responsibilities. The role of the Advisory Committee ("ADVISORY") is unclear to me, but appears to be an ultra-select aristocratic old boys club. Tony Gosling has assembled a treasure trove of details on Bilderbergs history and function. This is vital reading.
