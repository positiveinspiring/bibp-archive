# Government Agents Invent False Evidence to Destroy Reputations

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_nsa75.htm

The
National Security Agency (NSA) and its British counterpart (GCHQ)
are,
"attempting to manipulate and control
online discourse with extreme tactics of deception and
reputation-destruction," according to
a
new report by Glenn Greenwald.
Having published numerous stories gleaned
from the cache of documents obtained by former NSA subcontractor
Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald
declared on his new website, the Interceptor, that it was time that this
aspect of the tale were told.
The disturbing online activities carried out
by the GCHQ, and presented to the rest of the intelligence agencies in
the English-speaking "Five
Eyes" Alliance for their consideration, were described in a
document produced by the formerly super secret department of the GCHQ
known as JTRIG (Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group).
Analysis of the document and the scheme it
lays out reveals that intelligence officers set out purposefully,
"to control, infiltrate, manipulate, and
warp online discourse," Greenwald writes.
The name of the manual is enough to rile
civil libertarians: "The Art of Deception
-
Training for Online Covert Operations."
The tricks and tactics it promotes and
explains are more than any friend of liberty should be willing to accept
from agents of their own government.
In the pages of the JTRIG document obtained
by Snowden and released by Greenwald, agents are instructed in ways to
achieve two central goals:
-
First, "to inject all sorts of false
material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of
its targets"
-
Second, "to use social sciences and
other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to
generate outcomes it considers desirable"
Page after page, the document outlines how
agents should "disrupt" the lives - online and real life - of targets,
including instructions on conducting "false
flag operations" online.
False flags are defined in an online
dictionary as an operation,
"designed to deceive in such a way that
the operations appear as though they are being carried out by other
entities, groups or nations than those who actually planned and
executed them."
Weaving these lies, convincing people that
stories they read online are legitimate news stories with the villains
and heroes accurately identified, is apparently one of the priorities
for the Anglophone intelligence gathering apparatus.
Need further proof that the entire
intelligence community needs to be brought under strict control?
Consider the guidance given on another page
of the document on how to use,
-
fake photos
-
fake news stories
-
fake e-mails,
...etc. to create an image of a person that
is absolutely untrue.
In a page entitled "Discredit a Target," the
reader/intelligence agent is given the following tips on how to
effectively bring a person into disrepute:
-
"Set up a honey-trap" [a honey-trap is a
type of espionage involving catching a target in a compromising
sexual situation]
-
"Change their photos on social
networking sites"
-
"Write a blog purporting to be one of
their victims"
-
"Email/text their colleagues, neighbors
[sic], friends, etc."
Its difficult to imagine a more
unconscionable program.
The activities described deserve to be
shouted from the rooftops. The governments of the United States and
Great Britain currently employ teams of agents whose responsibility is
to ruin the lives of those individuals whove had the misfortune to run
afoul of the establishment.
In light of these revelations, it is
difficult to know what to believe and what not to believe, even when the
evidence presented against someone appears "credible" or "reliable."
Additional slides in the "Art of Deception"
presentation created by the GCHQ promote similar tactics for use in
bringing down companies that find themselves in the surveillance
communitys crosshairs.
As Greenwald reports, in one of the slides,
GCHQ admits that both the tactics and the targets of this program push
the boundaries of legal surveillance activities.
Greenwald writes:
Critically, the "targets" for this deceit
and reputation-destruction extend far beyond the customary roster of
normal spycraft: hostile nations and their leaders, military agencies,
and intelligence services.
In fact, the discussion of many of these
techniques occurs in the context of using them in lieu of "traditional
law enforcement" against people suspected (but not charged or convicted)
of ordinary crimes or, more broadly still, "hacktivism," meaning those
who use online protest activity for political ends.
To put a finer point on this program,
government agents are conducting operations specifically designed to
discredit and defame people that have never been accused of any crime!
Any person who has any sort of online
presence is a potential target for the creation of a malicious and
completely manufactured cyberattack that will cause readers, friends,
family, and customers doubt the trustworthiness of the target.
After exposing all this information,
Greenwald asks a very pertinent question:
"Who would possibly trust a
government to exercise these powers at all, let alone do so in
secret, with virtually no oversight, and outside of any cognizable
legal framework?"
Every day that passes without putting the
pause on these programs and imposing some oversight by Congress on such
activities, another brick is stacked on the wall of surveillance that is
being constructed around the United States and other countries.
Now, with the information reported in this
article in mind, Americans, Britons, and others are not only under
surveillance by the secret intelligence agents, but those agents are
anonymously weaving a web of seemingly credible deceptions designed to
destroy the lives of the targets - people innocent of any
'crime'.
Furthermore, this article reveals that those
whose lives are ruined by these schemes are not traditional targets of
government cyberattacks, but are individuals without any ties to
terrorism whatsoever.
Which individual or group will be the next
to have their reputations obliterated by the tampering of
technologically advanced government agents?
