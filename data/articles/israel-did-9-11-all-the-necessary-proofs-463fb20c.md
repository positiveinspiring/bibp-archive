TheInfoUnderground Website
Larry Silverstein
Larry Silverstein - Explains his reason for
purchasing the towers as "I felt a compelling urge to own them." Larry had
breakfast in "Windows on the World" restaurant every single morning.
On 9/11
he never showed up. Neither did his daughter who worked in building 7.
Frank Lowy
Frank Lowy - Owner of Westfield America. In May 2001, Westfield paid $US127
million for a 99-year lease on the retail area beneath the New York World
Trade Center. Lowy was a member of the Golani Brigade, and fought in the
Israeli war of independence.
Lowy steered clear of the WTC on 9/11.
Who authorized the lease of the WTC complex to Silverstein?
Lewis Eisenberg
Chairman of the New York Port Authority.
All three men (Larry Silverstein, Frank Lowy, Lewis Eisenberg) are high ranking Jews in the
Anti Defamation League and
United
Jewish Appeal.
Who pushed the WTC for privatization?
Ronald S. Lauder
Ronald S. Lauder -
He was on the board of directors of the NY board of privatization. He is the
key individual who lobbied for the privatization of the WTC, but he also got
Stewart Airport, formerly Stewart AFB, to become privatized. Oddly, the
flight-paths of flight 175 and flight 11 converged directly over this
airport.
Lauder is active in the following organizations:
-
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations
-
Jewish National Fund
-
World Jewish Congress
-
American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee
-
Anti-Defamation League
-
Jewish Theological Seminary
Lauder has funded a school for the Mossad in Herzliya, Israel.
Who ran security at all three airports of "alleged" hijackings?
ICTS International / Huntsleigh USA (wholly owned subsidiary)
ICTS International -
Owned by Ezra Harel and Menachem Atzmon. Both Israeli Jews.
It is run by "experts" in the security and intelligence field. Israeli
intelligence that is. Most employees were ex- Shin Bet agents.
Is this airport security company, who ran the security at Dulles, Logan, and
Newark, really that shotty to allow 19 Arabs on board 4 different planes
with box-cutters, mace, and even a gun, or is there something else going on
here?
Menachem Atzmon was involved in an Israeli political scandal involving Ehud Olmert and other Likudnits in Israel.
ICTS was also in charge of airport security when the shoe bomber Richard
Reid boarded a plane with a shoe bomb (allegedly).
A few hours before the Patriot Act was voted on, it was edited to make
foreign companies in charge of security on 9/11 immune to lawsuits.
This
would prevent American courts from demanding that ICTS provide testimony or
hand over the missing surveillance videos from the airports.
Who was on board flight 11?
Daniel Lewin
Lewin, an Israeli Jew, was confirmed to be a member of the special Israeli
commando unit, the Sayeret Matkal, which specializes in "anti-hijack"
takeovers and assassinations. Originally, Betty Ong pointed to his seat, 9B,
as the one shooting people with a gun and leading the hijacking.
It was
later changed to him being shot, later revised to him being stabbed.
Who had the contract to run security at the WTC?
Kroll Associates, owned by... Jules Kroll - Jewish:
Kroll was run by... Jerome Hauer:
Hauer was also the guy chosen to run Mayor Rudy Guiliani's office of
emergency management from 1996 to 2000.
Jerome Hauer is also Jewish. Hauer's mother, Rose Muscatine Hauer, is the
retired Dean of the Beth Israel School of Nursing and the Honorary President
of the New York Chapter of Hadassah, the Daughters of Zion movement that is
one of the central Zionist organizations involved in the creation and
maintenance of the State of Israel.
Hauer, however, told journalist Sander Hicks in a phone conversation that
Larry Silverstein hired a "private" security team on his wtc complex. I
wonder who manned this "private" security team, since they are the lead
suspects in the placing of explosives.
Were Jews forewarned of the attacks?
Israeli instant messaging company,
Odigo, admitted that two of its employees
received instant messages
warning of an impeding attack 2 hours prior to the
first plane hitting.
This warning was not passed on to authorities, which could have saved
thousands of lives.
Odigo has a feature on its service that allows the passing on of messages
through a search feature based on nationality, such as Israeli. Knowing
these two particular Jews were forewarned, it is very likely they passed the
message on to other Jews considering that out of the 4000 Israeli Jews
believed to work in the trade towers, only ONE died that day.
Odigo has offices in New York, and in Herzliya, Israel. Herzliya happens to
be the Head Quarters of Mossad. Do the math.
Odigo was later bought up by another Israeli company called
Comverse. The
CEO of Comverse was Kobi Alexander, "dual" Israeli-US citizen, with
connections to Mossad. He has been charged on several counts of fraud.
Goldman Sachs Forewarned
On Sep 10, 2001, the Tokyo branch of
Goldman Sachs warned its
American employees to steer clear of American buildings.
Israeli ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Forewarned
ZIM, an Israeli company, vacated its office (10,000 square feet) in the
North WTC tower a few days before 9/11, breaking its lease. 49% of this
company is owned by the Israeli government.
The lease ran till the end of
2001, and the company lost $50,000 by breaking the lease.
Later, FBI agent
Michael Dick, who was investigating Israeli spying before and after 9/11 and
looking into the suspicious move, was removed from his duties by the head of
the Justice Departments criminal division, Michael Chertoff (Jewish).
Israeli espionage around 9/11
Shortly before 9/11, over 140 Israelis had been arrested for suspected
espionage. Some of them were posing as Art students.
These suspects targeted
or penetrated:
-
Military bases
-
DEA
-
FBI
-
Secret Service
-
ATF
-
U.S. Customs
-
IRS
-
INS
-
EPA
-
Interior Dept.
-
U.S. Marshals Service
-
various U.S.
Attorneys Offices
-
Secret government offices
-
unlisted private homes of law
enforcement/intelligence officers
Most of the suspects served in military
intelligence, electronic surveillance intercept and or explosive ordinance
units.
Dozens of Israelis were arrested in American malls kiosks selling toys,
acting as a front for a spying operation.
60 detained suspects worked for the Israeli company AMDOCS which provides
most directory assistance calls and almost call records and billings
services for the U.S. by virtue of its contracts with the 25 largest
telephone companies in the U.S.
All alleged 9/11 hijackers had fake IDs. During a joint FBI-CIA operation
against the lead patsy hijacker Mohammad Atta in Fort Lee, NJ in 2001, the
operation was photographed by Israeli agents and thereby compromised.
These
Jews were providing cover for the future patsy hijacker teams.
Fox News Report
911 - The Israeli Connection
Oct 26, 2006
More Israelis caught after 9/11 - 60 of them! After 9/11 More detentions of Israelis
Following 9/11, over 60 Israelis were detained either under the Patriot
anti-Terrorism Act or for immigrations violations.
Some of them were active
Israeli military personnel. A number of them failed polygraph examinations
when questioned for surveillance activities against the U.S. Some of them
were found to have been spying on Arabs.
This includes the "dancing Israelis" who were caught in multiple places
filming, and cheering the attacks.
These men admitted being Mossad agents.
Their names were:
-
Sivan & Paul Kurzberg
-
Yaron Schmuel
-
Oded Ellner
They later appeared on an Israeli talk show and claimed to be "documenting
the event".
CIA agent Robert Baer confirmed their cameras were set up
BEFORE
the first plane struck.
Another group of Israelis were caught with truck bombs around the George
Washington Bridge.
A third group of Jews were caught with a van that had a mural painted on the
side literally depicting the 9/11 attacks.
All of the white vans were working for the Mossad front company called
"urban moving systems" under direction of Dominic Suter, a Mossad agent, who
fled to Israel right after 9/11.
ALL of these Jews were sent back to Israel under direction of Michael Chertoff.
Don't think Israel could disable Norad? THINK AGAIN!!
Ptech Software systems computer control backdoor
Most national security computerized systems that would have scrambled jets
in the event of national emergencies such as multiple hijackings were
running on Ptech software.
Jew Michael S. Goff was marketing manager at Ptech and also worked for
Israeli database company
Guardium (Jew Director Amit Yoran); Guardium has
been funded by Mossad fronts. Ptech was funded by Lebanese and Saudi
Americans, but why did Goff leave a well-paying job at a Jewish law firm for
the dodgy startup Ptech?
Goff was obviously working as a sayanim.
MITRE corporation (computer software)
MITRE major defense contracting organization headed by
former Director of
Central Intelligence Jew James Schlesinger.
Ptech was with the
MITRE corporation in the basement of the FAA for two
years prior to 9/11. Their specific job was to look at inter-operability
issues the FAA had with NORAD and the Air Force in the case of an emergency.
This software was installed on the computers of most U.S. government
agencies. Including the military...
Precision guided plane anyone?
The plane hitting WTC North Tower
The first plane to hit the WTC (North Tower) hit the computer room of
Jewish-owned Kroll Associates (Managing Director Jerome M. Hauer), the
company that had acquired control of building security after the 1993 bomb
attack on the WTC.
Precision guided by equipment in the office anyone?
Who could possibly remote control planes into the towers? Ask DOV ZAKHEIM!!
Dov Zakheim's System Planning Corporation remote airplane control
technology
The
SPC Corporation provided the flight termination system and command
transmitter system, the technology that allows planes to be remote
controlled should the pilots be incapacitated or the plane hijacked.
Who quickly shipped off the WTC metal overseas?
Alan D. Ratners
Metals Management and
the SIMS group.
Ratner is Jewish.
Ratner merged with the SIMS group and the Hugo Neu corporation, and they
made a handsome profit. Ratner sold over 50,000 tons of crime scene evidence
steel to a Chinese company at $120 per ton; Ratner had obtained them for $70
per ton.
9/11 Investigation in Jewish hands from the start!!
Jews were appointed the chief judges:
-
Alvin K. Hellerstein - a judge for the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York and has been
involved in several high-profile 9/11 related cases including
consolidated master case against three airlines, ICTS
International NV and Pinkerton's airport security firms, the
World Trade Center owners, and Boeing Co., the aircraft
manufacturer
Alvin K. Hellerstein
-
Michael B. Mukasey -
This Jew judge oversaw the litigation between Larry
Silverstein and insurance companies after 9/11. Silverstein was awarded
billions.
Michael B. Mukasey
-
Kenneth Feinberg set up the victims compensation fund ($7 billion); the
Jews managed to get 97% of the victims families to take the money in
exchange for not demanding a legal investigation of 9/11. The minority of
family members demanding an investigation had to deal with a special
mediator: Jewess Sheila Birnbaum. Nothing happened though.
-
Benjamin Chertoff - (cousin of Michael Chertoff) wrote the 9/11 hit piece in
Popular Mechanics debunking 9/11 conspiracies using ridiculous strawmen.
Michael Chertoff
-
Stephen Cauffman Leader of NIST
cover-up of WTC 7 destruction. These
lowlifes continued to maintain that fire brought down WTC 7, a physical
impossibility.
Who wrote the fraudulent 9/11 commission report?
Philip Zelikow (Jewish Dual Citizen of Israel)
Jews in the Right Positions!
Rabbi Dov Zakheim
Rabbi Dov Zakheim Co-author of the PNAC paper on rebuilding Americas
defenses advocating the necessity of a Pearl Harbor-like incident to
mobilize America.
Served as Pentagon comptroller from May 4, 2001 to March
10, 2004. Two large sums of money disappeared from the Pentagon under him.
In the beginning $2.3 trillion was reported missing by Donald Rumsfeld
(September 10, 2001) and later Zakheim was unable to account for another
trillion dollars.
Zakheim also had squads of American F-15s and F-16s sold
as surplus to Israel at a fraction of their value.
Michael Chertoff
Michael Chertoff Jew assistant attorney general for the criminal division
of the Justice Department; later, Director of Homeland Security.
Richard Perle
Richard Perle Chairman of Pentagons Defense Policy Board. He was expelled
from Sen. Henry Jacksons office in the 1970s after the NSA caught him
passing highly classified documents to Israel.
Paul Wolfowitz
Paul Wolfowitz Was Deputy Defense Secretary and a member of the Defense
Policy Board in the Pentagon.
...plus many many more...
Israel caught creating fake Al Qaeda shortly after 9/11!!!
First Ariel Sharon attempts to spew propaganda that he thinks Palestine is
harboring "Al Qaeda" so as to justify attacks on it...
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ... said that al-Qaeda militants were
operating in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.
"We know that they are there. We
know that they are in Lebanon, working closely with Hezbollah. We know that
they are in the region," he said.
BBC News 12/5/2002
Then Palestinian officials arrested the fake "al qaeda" poseurs who were
actually Mossad agents.
"Officials from the Palestinian Authority have accused the Israeli spy
agency Mossad of setting up a fake al-Qaeda terrorist cell in Gaza.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said that Israel had set up the mock cell
in order to justify attacks in Palestinian areas."
BBC News - 12/8/2002
The BBC's Jeremy Cooke says that the Israeli Government is keen to
demonstrate to the Americans that they are facing a common enemy.
Mossad Agent posing as Al Qaeda, AGAIN!!
Adam Gadahn, pictured above, is the so called
Al Qaida spokesperson who
released videos of himself preaching Al Qaida goals and ideology on numerous
occasions.
The FBI even have him on their most wanted terrorists list.
It turns out he is a Jew named Adam Pearlman, from California. Adam's
grandfather, Carl Pearlman, was a prominent surgeon and on the Board of
Directors of the Anti-Defamation League!
Fake Al Qaida videos come from Jewish sources!!
These fake "Al Qaida" Pearlman videos are conveniently always obtained first
by a U.S gov't contractor called
IntelCenter.
This company is owned and run
by Ben Venzke, a Jew. IntelCenter is an offshoot of of
IDEFENSE, which was
staffed by senior PSYOP officer, Jim Melnick(Jewish), who worked directly
for Donald Rumsfeld for a time.
IntelCenter is probably getting these
"Jihad" videos straight from Mossad HQ in Herzliya, Israel.
Another "intel gathering" company is called
Site Intel Group which states
its purpose is...
"Studying the primary source propaganda, training manuals, and chatter of
terrorists offers insight into terrorists and their activities that can not
be obtained anywhere else. To fulfill this need, the SITE Intelligence Group
offers its Monitoring Service, which provides numerous daily translations of
terrorist propaganda and multimedia from primary source terrorist websites."
The director and founder of SITE Intel group is Rita Katz.
It turns out that Rita Katz is an Iraqi Jew!
Her father was a Jewish
businessman in Iraq and was sentenced to hanging after being caught SPYING
FOR ISRAEL in the 1967 war. After her father was hung, Rita and her mother
fled to Israel where she served in the Israeli army, which is compulsory,
and went to university in Tel Aviv!
Who was related to one of the "alleged" 9/11 hijackers?
NBC "obtains" video of Ziad Jarrah, nov 22, 2008
Still image from "laughing hijackers" video showing Ziad Jarrah (left),
and Mohammed Atta (right), allegedly making their martyrdom video just before
9/11, all the while laughing hysterically about it!
Ziad Jarrah's uncle, Ali Al Jarrah (pictured above), was recently discovered
by Lebanese authorities of being a Mossad Spy for 25 years!!
Coincidence? I
think NOT!
A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot
survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for
he is known and he carries his banners openly. But the traitor moves among
those within the gate freely. For the traitor appears not a traitor - a
murderer is less to be feared...
Cicero, 42 B.C.E.
