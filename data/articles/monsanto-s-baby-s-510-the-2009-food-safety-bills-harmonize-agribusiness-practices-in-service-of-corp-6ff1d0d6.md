Original report
I think its time to de-professionalize the public debate on
matters that vitally affect the lives of ordinary people. Its
time to snatch our futures back from the 'experts.' Time to
ask, in ordinary language, the public question and to demand, in
ordinary language, the public answer.
Arundhati Roy
Power Politics
Its enough to make you so queasy you lose your
lunch.
HR 875, the Food Safety Modernization Act of
2009, is a head-spinning piece of legislation that would radically change
the structure of the US governments regulatory agencies, usurping states
rights to federalize food inspection and determine what agricultural
practices are permissible.
Considerable concern has been voiced about what
this bill would mean for small and medium sized farmers, organic farming,
the future of conventional and organic seeds, the food localization
movement, and even home gardens. HR 875 would give regulators the power to
enter private property, which is conveniently redefined as premises, and
impose enormous fines for noncompliance.
Though not discussed in the corporate media,
numerous articles about it appear on the internet, launching a debate about
whether or not Monsanto is behind the bill.
In response to these articles, Brad Mitchell, a member of Monsantos public
relations staff who writes for the companys new blog - a less-than-stealth
effort to counter the publics deep distrust of the predatory corporation -
has gone on record stating that
Monsanto has absolutely nothing at all to do
with the bill.
Brads assurances aside, experience dictates that taking Monsanto at its
word is patently foolish.
But for those who need a bit more proof,
like the
Organic Consumers Association and
Food and Water Watch, lets
settle the issue, once and for all:
-
Who crafted the legislation and what do
they hope to gain by it?
-
Would it really make our food safer as
it claims, or would it make mandatory the industrial agricultural
practices that are the root cause of the food-borne illnesses it
claims to vanquish?
-
And what else might be at stake?
After a series of well-publicized cases of food
contamination E. coli-tainted meat, melamine-adulterated pet food and baby
formula, salmonella-infected peanut butter the public has been well primed
to look toward Congress to fix a poorly funded and insufficiently staffed
food safety inspection system.
And, right on cue, a crop of food safety bills
gets dumped our way.
The most controversial and transformational of these
pieces of legislation, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauros
HR 875, can be
traced directly to recommendations made by the
Trust for Americas Health, a
non-profit organization sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
The Trust for Americas Health has produced reports that serve as blueprints
for a major restructuring of the agencies involved in overseeing food safety
policy as well as eye-popping changes to the public health system.
Its recommendations also have also made their
way into the other food safety bills that have been recently introduced in
Congress:
-
SB 425, the Food Safety and Tracking
Improving Act
-
HR 814, the Trace Act of 2009
-
HR 759, the Food and Drug
Administration Globalization Act of 2009
While the vaguely worded HR 875 gives the
appearance of being a reasonable attempt to fix the problems outlined, a
close inspection of the blueprints on which they are based - and a bit of
knowledge about the industry players who crafted them - reveals critical
clues about how the public health system would be transformed for the
benefit of biotech, pharmaceutical and agribusiness giants.
Non-profit foundations have long served as
effective tools for corporate wealth to influence public policy, providing
the means to guarantee outcomes that enrich corporations at the publics
expense.
The global pharmaceutical and consumer product
company Johnson & Johnsons tax-exempt foundation is no different.
Tayloring the Message
- The Trust for Americas Health
The public should familiarize itself with three key reports produced by The
Trust for Americas Health:
-
Keeping Americas Food Safe - A
Blueprint for Fixing the Food and Safety System at the US Department
of Health and Human Services (1)
-
Fixing Food Safety - Protecting
Americas Food Supply from Farm-to-Fork (2)
-
the Blueprint for a Healthier America:
Modernizing the Federal Public Health System to Focus on Prevention
and Preparedness (3)
President Obamas nominee for Commissioner of
the Food and Drug Administration Margaret Hamburg, MD, sits on the
board of directors at the Trust for Americas Health.
Hamburg, a well-connected player in the public
health field, also serves on the board of directors of the Rockefeller
Foundation. Among other things, the
Rockefellers vast fortune is
responsible for funding foundations and institutes that spread unsafe
genetically-engineered food crops around the world.(4)
Sadly, those who hoped that
Obamas election
would herald positive changes have repeatedly found themselves duped:
the
deep corporate ties of his appointees guarantee a continuation of corporate
control over the US government, a veritable concierge service on steroids
for private interests.
A notable craftsman at the Trust for Americas Health is none other than the
notorious
Michael R. Taylor, JD.
Taylor penned a paper included as an appendix of
Keeping America Safe: A Blueprint for
Fixing the Food Safety System at the Department of Health and Human
Services called Restructuring Food Safety at HHS: Design and
Implementation.
In it, Taylor prescribes the creation of a new
Food Safety Administration that consolidates all safety functions formerly
performed by a host of other government regulatory agencies and institutes
on a federal level the use of industry-friendly risk assessment methods.
Monsantos Jack of All
Trades
Most people who know Michael Taylors name recall that he worked as
Monsantos lawyer at King & Spalding for years before being appointed to the
FDA to oversee the swift introduction into the marketplace of GMOs.
He did so by ramming through a faux scientific
regulatory conceit called substantial equivalence.
Industry-independent scientists have rightly criticized the concept of
substantial equivalence as an inappropriate method for determining safety,
calling it,
a pseudo-scientific concept because it is a
commercial and political judgment masquerading as it if were scientific.
It is, moreover, inherently anti-scientific because it was created
primarily to provide an excuse for not requiring biochemical or
toxicological tests. It therefore serves to discourage and inhibit
potentially informative scientific research. (5)
FDA scientists at the Division of Food Chemistry
and Technology wanted to see testing performed to ensure that GMO foods
didnt increase levels of naturally occurring toxins, create new, previously
unidentified toxins, increase the tendency to gather toxic substances from
the environment such as pesticides or heavy metals, and alter the level
nutrients.(6)
Ignoring their scientific objections, the
politically-appointed Taylor let loose GMO technology on the nation of
guinea pigs without requiring any legitimate safety and toxicology
investigations to protect public health.
He also ensured that the public
would remain ignorant of GMOs in their food by instituting a no-labeling
policy. Now, almost 80% of the food sold in grocery stores contains GMOs. Monsanto subsequently rewarded Taylor for his government work by
making him its Vice President of Public Policy.
These days, we find that Taylor has morphed from Monsantos VP into a
research professor at George Washington University School of Public Heath
and Health Services.
He also spends his time writing policy at a
number of industry-funded think tanks, including Resources for the Future,
Resolve Inc, the Food Safety Research Consortium, and the Alliance to End
Hunger,
Those who are concerned about what the
Organic Consumers Association calls the real Monsanto bill, The Global
Food Security Act (SB 384), can see Taylors contribution to that piece
of legislation by reviewing a report he wrote for a think tank called
the Partnership to Cut Hunger and Poverty in Africa. The report,
Beating Africas Poverty By Investing in Africas Infrastructure,(7)
supports the expansive agenda of biotech firms.
The organization is funded in part by the
Rockefeller and Gates foundations, and Taylors work product provides the
rational for SB 384.(8)
According the organizations website, it aims to
implement Partnership activities to strengthen agricultural and rural
enterprises and to facilitate their integration into regional, national and
global markets by bringing together,
core representatives from U.S. and
Africa-based private and public organizations who have experience with
Africas agriculture and trade-related issues.
To give him credit, Taylor is relentless and
prolific. If only his work sought to empower rather than enslave.
Since shedding the title of Vice President of Monsanto, Taylor has been busy
promoting the concept of risk assessment as a means to deal with
food-borne illness as an alternative to urging regulatory agencies to
actually enforce laws already on the books and to adequately fund them so
they could do so.
Like substantial equivalence, the risk assessment
conceit offers a great opportunity to change the system to benefit corporate
interests.
Taylor has spent years churning out the
necessary conceptual building blocks in cross-pollinating think tanks and
foundations to create the intellectual framework for legislative proposals
like these food safety bills.
The reports produced by the Trust of Americas Health rely heavily on risk
assessment, management and communication, a form of message control hatched
at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, a corporate-funded affair that
provides scientific justification for a wide range of policies
corporations want to see implemented.
Using this method of risk analysis, the
necessary justification can be produced for just about whatever outcome is
wished by the underwriters.
Its no real surprise that Taylors think-tank-funded policy on risk
assessment, like his report Food Safety Updated: Developing Tools for a
More Science and Risk-Based Approach, (9) underwritten by the
Milbank Memorial Fund and Resources for the Future, has been embraced and
institutionalized by the
Codex Alimentarius Commission.
Codex A Tool of Global
Governance by Corporate Command
If some variation of this batch of bad bills is passed into legislation, US
citizens will find their laws considerably closer to becoming harmonized
with
Codex Alimentarius, a set of international food codes crafted by
unaccountable and unelected bureaucrats in conjunction with vested industry
and trade interests.
Its important that the public learns more about
Codex, because its standards will be enforced by the World Trade
Organization to govern global trade practices of all its member nations.
Furthermore, this body of food codes will take
legal precedence over national laws, like the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health
and Education Act (DSHEA).
The US media are assiduously silent on the matter of Codex. Under the
helpful cover of the medias information blackout, Codex Alimentarius
Commission meetings are regularly attended by officials from,
-
the Departments
of Agriculture
-
Health and Human Services, State, Commerce
-
the
Environmental Protection Agency
-
the Office of US Trade Representative
-
the US Codex Office
Non-governmental agencies in attendance at the
meetings include the,
-
49th Parallel Biotechnology
Consortium
-
the Biotechnology Industry Organization
-
Consumers Union
-
Crop Life International
-
Dow Chemical
-
Dupont
-
the European Association of
Bioindustries
-
the Grain and Feed Trade Association
-
the International Cooperative Alliance
-
the International Council of Beverages
Associations
-
the International Council of Grocery
Manufacturers Association
-
the Institute of Food Technologists
-
the International Glutamate Technical
Committee and the International Life Sciences Institute
-
Monsanto
-
Sygenta,
...among others with the exception, that is, of
any democratically elected and accountable representatives of citizens these
food codes will affect.
The standards created by the Codex Alimentarius Commission are set to enable
industry interests to dictate and control rules covering vitamins, minerals
and nutrients, genetically modified plants and livestock, toxic residues,
antibiotics, drugs, growth stimulants and other hormones in food and
animals, organic foods, the irradiation of plants and animal food and
nanotechnology.
Scott Tips, President of the National
Health Federation, the only accredited health freedom organization allowed
to participate at Codex meetings, projects that these standards are on tract
to be implemented sometime between 2011 and 2013.
Codex committees, such as,
-
the Codex Committees on Food Additives
and Contaminants (CCFAC)
-
Pesticide Residues (CCPR)
-
Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods (CCRVDF)
-
Food Hygiene (CCFH)
-
General Principles (CCGP)
-
Food Labeling (CCFL)
-
Nutrition and Food for Dietary Uses (CCNFDU)
-
Import and Export Inspection and
Certification Systems (CCFICS)
-
Methods of Analysis an Sampling (CCMAS),
...all employ the concept of risk management to
determine the rules they recommend to the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC).
Codex standards are of critical importance to agribusiness, because they are
acknowledged as the appropriate guidelines in the Sanitary and Phytosanitary
(SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreements of the WTO Agreement.
While the WTO had provisions that allowed member
states to create barriers to trade by citing national legislation to ensure
food safety, those provisions would become void, thanks to the SPS and TBT
agreements, if an international safety standard created by Codex determined
otherwise.
So, thanks to the unelected and unaccountable
private deal-makers who wrote these trade agreements, Codex rules will trump
national law.
Meet the Missus -
Christine Lewis Taylor
Undermining US law for the benefit of multinational corporations is a family
affair in the Taylor household. To see how the concept of risk assessment
can be usefully abused, lets look at how Mrs. Michael Taylor adopts
the conceit to her purposes.
Christine Lewis Taylor, a veteran FDA employee, has been busy working up the
scientific justification for placing a cap on the level of nutrients
people should be allowed to consume.
To do so, she pushes a perverse concept that
defines nutrients as toxins. In other words, Mrs. Taylor would like us all
to believe that the vitamins and minerals needed by cells throughout the
body in order to function and detoxify should be considered hazardous,
requiring governmental oversight that would limit peoples exposure to them
under law.
After a stint heading up the Codex delegation on the Committee on Food
Labeling and another as a delegate to Codexs Committee on Nutrition and
Foods for Special Dietary Uses, Christine Lewis Taylor was farmed out by the
Institute of Medicine to the World Health Organization, where she played an
instrumental role as Project Director in applying the risk assessment model
to redefine nutrition as we know it.
Her mission:
To develop the framework whereby an upper
safe limit would be set, defining the amount supplements the public
should be allowed to purchase except by prescription.
In her WHO capacity, she organized a seminar,
selected the scientists who would be allowed to participate in it, and
oversaw the groups published conclusion.(10)
US law regulates supplements as food. But the pharmaceutical industry wants
to change that and have supplements regulated as drugs, and bureaucrats like
Mrs. Taylor are doing what they can to comply.
Taylor argues that people are exposed to too
many nutrients and wants to see the establishment of a one-size-fits-all
international standard set that stipulates how much of each nutrient people
need, a amount that in some cases is less than the already established
recommended daily allowances.(11)
But the good news, at least for pharmaceutical companies, is that there
would be more profit to be made in treating a host of vitamin-deficiency
diseases.
And, once these guidelines are adopted by Codex,
people would no longer have the freedom to purchase therapeutic amounts of
dietary supplements to compensate for a nutrient-deficient and legally
poisoned food supply to which were subjected.
Supplements would no longer be consider food as
they are under
DSHEA but instead would be regulated as drugs, available only
by prescription or in amounts so limited as to render them insufficiently
helpful in the prevention of disease.
People are subject to disease not because they are deficient in
pharmaceuticals.
We are subject to disease because we either do
not get the nutrients we need from our food sources or because we are
exposed to environmental toxins and harmful food adulterants like
hydrogenated oils, high fructose corn syrup, MSG, pesticide residues,
aspartame, and GMOs, falsely deemed safe by the FDA. These adulterants
contribute directly to a long list of predictable degenerative diseases.
But thanks to the tireless work of Mrs. Taylor,
the chemical cartel will get wealthier by making us sick and wealthier still
by treating us for illnesses its products cause.
Sweeping Inconvenient
Facts Under the Rug
In addition to her work toward the implementation of Codex, its worth
noting that Christine Taylor Lewis has done her part to rewrite
history to make her husbands tenure at the FDA to appear less corrupt than
it, in fact, was.
Talk about housekeeping. While serving as the
thesis advisor to a Tufts university student, Taylor oversaw the details of
a dissertation entitled the Labeling of Genetically Modified Foods:
Stakeholder Perceptions of the Food and Drug Administrations Public
Consultation Processes and Food Industry Reactions to the United States
Voluntary and European Union Mandatory Policies. (12)
This thesis belongs to Janice Lee Albert, who happened to be an employee of
the UNs Food and Agricultural Organization in Rome while working on her
dissertation.
Alberts dissertation focuses on the controversy over labeling GMOs, a topic that deeply involved
Michael Taylor, her thesis advisors
husband.
However, that marital relationship is never
disclosed in the dissertation. In fact, while Mr. Taylors work is described
throughout the dissertation, Albert fails to identify him by name as a key
participant in the controversy.
On the contrary, when Michael Taylor is finally
mentioned by name, it is as one of twenty-four people Albert interviewed to
obtain their views on the appropriateness of the FDAs labeling decisions.
Astonishingly, Albert identifies Michael Taylor
as an Independent Expert, revealing nothing about the fact he
-
previously worked as a lawyer for the
company whos product was getting special treatment or
-
the fact that he was the one in charge
of implementing the concept of substantial equivalence at the FDA
or
-
went to work for Monsanto afterwards
Under Christine Lewis Taylors supervision,
Alberts thesis defends the FDAs controversial labeling decision and its
consultation processes with the public as being conducted as intended by
law.
Albert claims that members of the public who are
dissatisfied with the FDAs decision not to label GMO products just dont
understand the all the factors that go into making decisions at the FDA.
Shes probably correct on that point: Most of the public is under the
mistaken assumption that the FDA has a responsibility to protect it from the
unsafe products of an untested technology.
Thanks to her explanation, at least we now know
that certain employees of the FDA consider their only legal obligation is to
offer the public an opportunity to voice its concerns, not act upon them.
Albert contends that the exact nature of the public concerns about GMOs was
outside the scope of her dissertation and therefore unnecessary for her to
address or even note. Nevertheless, a thorough pre-market study of the
health risks associated with GMOs should never have been outside the scope
of the FDAs responsibilities.
Scientists and journalists have lost their jobs for daring to cross the
powerful biotech industry to publicize the health risks of GMOs.(13)
The well-controlled media dutifully ignores the pile up of evidence of the
nature of the dangers.
In recent months, research has been published
showing that GM corn increases infertility (14) and that the key
ingredients in Monsantos Round-Up Ready, the herbicide used on all GMO
crops, cause death to human cells.(15)
Given what we now know about the dangers of GMOs, we should dispense with
the discussion of whether or not to label them and move right to the topic
of banning them altogether.
Identifying What Ails
Us
Americans should be able to have confidence that the food they eat is safe.
The Trust for Americas Health, however, is
using recent food-borne illness events as an excuse to make radical and
unnecessary changes to a regulatory system has been purposely underfunded
and understaffed.(16)
While focusing exclusively of food borne
illnesses, it has ignored the predictable diseases suffered by millions that
are caused by the chronic consumption of foods adulterated with ingredients
that an industry-dominated FDA deems to be GRAS, that is, generally
regarded as safe.
Restoring and protecting our health requires a real understanding about what
ails us. To put things in perspective, food borne illnesses are responsible
for some 5,000 death a year; but over 700,000 people die each year from
government-approved medicine,(17) and millions more suffer from
predictable diseases that could be prevented if we had a safe, clean,
whole-foods based food supply.
If we allow those behind the food safety bills
to use this crisis as an opportunity to change the food safety system,
transnational corporations will have even more control over our health than
they do now.
Prevention, as they say, is the best cure.
