Orwell's
conceptualization
of today's social class
structure
America is being nudged and now pushed into the
heinous world
of Agenda 21.
However, I believe that when self-preservation
takes over, the use of force will be necessary to get most people to
willingly go along with this encroaching tyranny. This is another topic for
another article.
Whistleblowers such as
Deborah Tavares,
Rosa Korie and
Patrick Wood et al., have all been sounding the
Agenda 21 alarm for a very long time.
Yet, with each and every passing day,
we see new stories which inch us toward the end point destination of total
tyrannical control of our daily lives which will result in the loss of our
fortunes.
No matter how many times a journalist in the
alternative media identifies Agenda 21 as the scourge on the planet, it
seems as if more people are not listening, and even fewer are acting.
This is because most of our population is no
longer capable of critical thinking and subsequently accept the unproven
philosophies of climate change and the Agenda 21 policies which underlie
this myth.
Most Americans feel that going along with the social planners
will help them survive and even thrive.
Too much CNN, too much FOX, too much
fluoridated
water and too many distractions have left us with a country incapable of
defending itself from enemies both foreign and domestic.
Recent Undeniable Truths About
Agenda 21
When we carry out the principles of Agenda 21
out to its end point destination, the citizens of our country,
-
will be living
in less than 500 square foot
stack and pack apartments
-
they will
not own an automobile because it will be cost prohibitive
-
they will not
grow their own food
-
they will pay even a greater disproportionate
percentage of their income for housing costs
Additionally, there will be no property rights,
because there will be no Constitution.
There will be no small farms, privately owned
farms and privately grown food. Since the government will soon own
all healthcare, most of us will be priced out of the market
and the Agenda 21 CODEX provisions will soon control alternative healthcare
treatments.
The Agenda 21 inspired Cap and Trade policies
seek to reduce the energy usage of the average citizen by 80%.
This means
the average American will be living an 1890â€²s lifestyle. And more than
likely, some the population reduction quotes which are so infamous (e.g. Ted
Turner's expressed desire to
reduce the planet's population by 95%), may
come to fruition.
The statements in this paragraph are
self-evident.
But for those who new to this topic, pull up a chair, grab
your favorite beverage and be prepared to be shocked as you weave your way
through the words of the 'Agenda 21 planners':
Agenda 21 - United Nations Conference on Environment &
Development - Rio de Janerio, Brazil, 3-14 June 1992
What is not obvious is the dismantling of
America's traditional socio-economic structure.
A new and evolving social
class structure is emerging right before our eyes. The former economic
mobility of the new American society (i.e. rags to riches) has all but
disappeared.
The new social stratification will be forever
fixed under the new social class structure of Agenda 21.
The Three Social Class America's
Brand of Agenda 21
Agenda 21 seeks to totally eliminate the middle
class and the Obama wing of Agenda 21 is well on its way to making this a
reality.
Today, there are more
American citizens who are receiving federal handouts than there are working
Americans. Soon these classes will become one class and what is left of the
middle class is destroyed. You may find this analysis to be very
enlightening as to the
veracity of these claims.
Most people believe that America is bifurcating
into a two class society:
Temporarily, these
two groups still constitute two separate classes.
However, they will soon
become one class. This will leave America with the traditional two class
system, the haves and the have-nots. However, we are not quite there yet.
At the present time, we still see a three class
system.
For the purposes of clarity and discussion, we
will refer to these classes as,
-
the First Tier (the elite)
-
the Second Tier
(the beleaguered middle class)
-
the Third Tier (the growing welfare class
that has been fully domesticated through federal handouts)
The First Tier
On the top level of the pyramid we find the
George Soros', the
David Rockefellers', et al.
The minions of these elite, control the
politicians and the legislation, they control the dialogue (e.g.
sustainability and climate change) and they are moving towards controlling
every aspect of our lives.
In a case of "Rules for thee, but not for me",
the elite do not live by the same Agenda 21 policies that they are
attempting to impose on everyone else. Make no mistake about it, the First
Tier are the creators of Agenda 21. They get the corporate heads and the
politicians to enforce their brand of Utopia, with the promise of salvation
for these minions who play along.
And many of these minions know exactly what is
coming.
For example, why do you think
McCain can endure the condemnation
of his own home-state Republican Party without blinking an eye? It is
because he knows he's working for a higher authority. McCain obviously
believes that the life of he and his family are at stake as he throws
caution to the wind.
To McCain's mindset, it is a matter of either
serving the globalist monster, or perish.
McCain's mindset would also explain the abject
lunacy of Pelosi, Reed, Bachman, Graham and all the other out-of-touch KoolAid drinkers. Someone should point out to these
"public servants" that
history does not paint a kind picture for those who help to facilitate a
tyrannical takeover of a government.
Most minions usually get sacrificed along the
way. Oh, by the way, John McCain told a town hall audience in Mesa, AZ., and
clearly stated that
he had never heard of Agenda 21.
The purveyors of Agenda 21 and their minions are
your worst enemy.
The Second Tier
In the Second Tier of America, lies what is left
of the middle class.
Frequently, these Americans, are still able to
keep their job with inflation damaged salaries and are still trying to hold
on to the outdated notion of the American dream.
These people face the prospect of working second
jobs and becoming bargain hunters when it comes to shopping. College student
loans for their children, the soon-to-be-gone pensions and retirement
accounts as well as the increasing theft of their home mortgages constitute
the increasing threats to their solvency.
God bless the Second Tier whose majority tries
to embrace the pseudo-threat of climate change by conserving more and more.
For example, the people of Arizona heeded the
call of Arizona Public Service (APS) by adopting more "eco-friendly" solar
technology and what did APS do as a result? They raised the electric rates
because they claimed they lost money on all the solar technology adopted by
the public which led to declining energy use.
If this does not expose the fraud of Agenda 21,
I do not know what does.
We see the same silly mindset in the state of
Washington, where the legislature wants to impose a 1.5 cent tax on every
mile driven because the state is losing revenue due to the use of more fuel
efficient cars. Same chapter, just a different verse.
Agenda 21 proponents will never let you catch up
and prosper, no matter how many of their programs that you successfully
embrace. The Agenda 21 system is pervasive and seeks to destroy the middle
class at all costs.
Many of the second tier of America, still
believe
Obama when he says that economic recovery is right around the
corner. So they keep drinking the KoolAid and work harder and harder while
falling further behind the lifestyle once enjoyed by their parents.
Adding insult to injury, this second tier is
being forced to support those that cannot/will not work crowd through higher
taxes and regulatory fees.
Eventually, every single one these people in the
second tier will eventually slip into the Third Tier.
The Third Tier
The third tier has an interesting dynamic.
Meet the welfare class.
Many members of this class have been
hopelessly conditioned to not take personal responsibility for their lives.
For an excellent description of the psychological mindset for many in this
social class, see Seligman's experiments on
acquired learned helplessness.
There is almost no social
mobility, only misery.
Once someone is on federal welfare, the chances
of staying off are near zero.
This is a great personal tragedy as many people
in the Third Tier are robbed of their autonomy and self-determination. And
this is just what the social planners want as they want us hopeless,
helpless and totally dependent on their generosity.
The financial drain to support this growing
class, now over 50% of the country, is breaking the backs of what is left of
the middle class.
Soon the remnants of the middle class will
collapse and be absorbed by the Third Tier.
A two-class social structure is emerging in
America.
-
There are the hopelessly poor, who do not riot
in exchange for basic life support services.
-
And there will be the social
class that hordes all resources in an attempt to control the populace.
This transformation will be completed when there
are too few of the middle class to support the subsistence life-style of the
Third Tier.
It is uncertain if the ultimate middle class
collapse will come by a sudden chain of events like the ones we witnessed in
1929. Or, will the slide continue in the form of its barely perceptible but
dramatic slide?
There is one thing that you can count on.
Americans will reach a breaking point when subsistence payments to the Third
Tier are greatly reduced. When these parents, who love their children no
less than anyone else, cannot adequately feed them, there is going to be
trouble in the American streets.
Perhaps this is why
DHS has acquired 2.2
billion rounds of ammunition and
2700 armored personnel carriers.
If the "people" lose this war against the elite
and we disintegrate into a society of haves and have-nots, we will indeed be
living the American nightmare, Agenda 21 style.
