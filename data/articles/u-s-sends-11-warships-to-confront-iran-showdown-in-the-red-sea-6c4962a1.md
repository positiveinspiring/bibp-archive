Israel National News is reporting :
Egypt allowed at least one Israeli and 11 American warships to pass through
the Suez Canal as an Iranian flotilla approaches Gaza.
What should we make of the fact that 11 U.S. warships and an Israeli warship
are sailing up the Suez Canal on their way to the Red Sea?
This is - on the surface - a face-off over Iran's support for relief ships
trying to sail into Gaza. Specifically, Iran has said it will have Iranian
military ships escort the flotilla providing humanitarian goods to Gaza to
make sure it arrives safely. On the other hand, the U.S. has backed Israel's
blockade of Gaza.
Tensions are obviously high between the U.S. and Israel, on the one hand,
and Iran on the other. The U.S. and Israel have talked for years of bombing
Iran's nuclear sites.
As the
Telegraph wrote last July (2009):
Israeli warships have deployed to the Red Sea for what has been described as
a rehearsal for a possible attack on Iran.
Israeli and Egyptian officials said two ships had sailed through the Suez
Canal into the Red Sea.
Media reports in Israel said the two Saar-class missile ships had been sent
as a "message" to the Tehran government...
An armada of U.S. warships in the Red Sea is similarly meant to convey a
credible threat to attack Iran.
Indeed, because the
Red Sea connects with the Arabian Sea (and see
this), a
large navy presence in the Red Sea will escalate tensions dramatically.
This could quickly lead to a real confrontation. This is especially true
because warships from hostile nations could be in very close quarters, and
one mistake (such as accidentally bumping into a foreign ship) could
unintentionally lead to war.
But we can't look at this face-off in a vacuum.
Intelligence Failures
Remember that there have been numerous intelligence failures in the past
which have led to war.
For example, the U.S. Navy's own historians now say that the sinking of the
USS Maine -- the justification for America's entry into the Spanish-American
War -- was probably
caused by an internal explosion of coal, rather than an
attack by the Spanish.
It is also now well-accepted that the Gulf of Tonkin Incident which led to
the Vietnam war
was a fiction (confirmed
here).
And two lies were used to justify the 1991 Gulf War:
(Technically, the statement about Kuwaiti babies did not come from
the U.S. government, but from a public relations firm hired by the
government).
Who Dunnit?
While - as documented above - inaccurate reports have helped rally support
for war, other methods for drumming up support have been used as well.
As I
wrote in February:
Forget the claims and allegations that false flag terror - governments
attacking people and then blaming others in order to create animosity
towards those blamed - has been used throughout history.
This essay will solely discuss government admissions to the use of false
flag terror.
For example:
The
CIA admits that it hired Iranians in the 1950's to pose as Communists
and stage bombings in Iran in order to turn the country against its
democratically-elected president
Israel admits that an Israeli terrorist cell operating in Egypt planted
bombs in several buildings, including U.S. diplomatic facilities, then left
behind "evidence" implicating the Arabs as the culprits (one of the bombs
detonated prematurely, allowing the Egyptians to identify the bombers, and
several of the Israelis later confessed) (and see
this and
this)
The well-respected former Indonesian president admits that the government
probably had a role in the Bali bombings
The former Italian Prime Minister, an Italian judge, and the
former head of
Italian counterintelligence admit that
NATO, with the help of the Pentagon
and CIA, carried out terror bombings in Italy and blamed the communists, in
order to rally peoples support for their governments in Europe in their
fight against communism.
As one participant in
this formerly-secret program
stated:
"You had to attack civilians, people, women, children, innocent
people, unknown people far removed from any political game. The reason was
quite simple. They were supposed to force these people, the Italian public,
to turn to the state to ask for greater security".
(Italy
joined NATO in1949, years before the bombings occurred)
As admitted by the U.S. government, recently declassified documents show
that in the 1960's, the American Joint Chiefs of Staff signed off on a plan
to blow up AMERICAN airplanes (using an elaborate plan involving the
switching of airplanes), and also to commit terrorist acts on American soil,
and then to blame it on the Cubans in order to justify an invasion of Cuba.
See the following
ABC news report; the
official documents; and watch below this
interview with the former Washington Investigative Producer for ABC's World
News Tonight with Peter Jennings [while the Joint Chiefs of Staff pushed for
Operation Northwoods to be carried out, cooler heads prevailed; President
Kennedy or his Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara apparently vetoed the
plan]
There are many other instances of false flag attacks used throughout history
proven by the historical evidence. See
this,
this and
this. The above are
only some examples of governments admitting to using false flag terror.
Iran
Many high-level people have warned of the use of a false flag attack to
justify war with Iran.
For example:
Jimmy Carter's former National Security Adviser and Obama's initial foreign
policy adviser -
Zbigniew Brzezinski -
told the Senate that a terrorist act
might be carried out in the U.S. and falsely blamed on Iran to justify war
against that nation
Congressman Ron Paul
told Congress:
"I am concerned, however, that a
contrived Gulf of Tonkin- type incident may occur to gain popular support
for an attack on Iran"
And a member of the British Parliament, George Galloway,
stated: "there is a
very real danger" that the American government will stage a false flag
terror attack in order to justify war against Iran
Thus, if any elements within the U.S. or Israeli government wish to find an
excuse to attack Iran, they could either manufacture false intelligence or
carry out a false flag attack.
A war with Iran would benefit no one other than the giant defense
contractors would
plunge the world into a very deep depression
(notwithstanding George W. Bush's
sentiment to the contrary). Indeed, if
China and Russia side with Iran, the U.S. might end up losing against Iran.
May cool heads prevail.
