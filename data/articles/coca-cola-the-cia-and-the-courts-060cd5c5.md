Part 1
August 13, 2000
This series is going to deal with the following:
-
Cocaine and Coca-Cola
-
Coca-Cola and the espionage/mafia
cartel. Coca-Cola's reputed spy apparatus inside their enemy's camp
in an important unpublicized blockbuster court case against the soda
pop monster
-
Malignant if not corrupt influence on
the Courts
-
Coca-Cola as "Big Brother" and the
Echelon worldwide spy machine
From the beginning, Coca-Cola always had a trace
of cocaine.
Early in the 20th Century it became
part of a now forgotten prosecution of the soda bubble water drink. Over the
years, doctors treating stomach ailments quietly used a mixture containing
Coca-Cola syrup base. Of course, NOT used by doctors, who knew the score,
was the base for Pepsi-Cola, Royal Crown Cola, or for that matter, any of
the other fizz drinks.
Savvy sorts, when they ran short of Drano, knew
to pour Coca-Cola down their home plumbing. The acids in Coke cleared the
plumbing almost as good as the high-priced hardware store stuff.
Nutritionists raised their eyebrows. What does Coca-Cola do to the human
plumbing?
Coke advertised with scenes of sports stars, speed boat enthusiasts, and
such. To give the impression that Coke adds to a vibrant, healthy life. Yet
Coke rightfully cannot make any nutrition claims. At least that is what
their critics swear by and swear at.
Hey, how come Drano and other pipe-uncloggers, do not also advertise with
speed boat pictures, sports stars, and such?
Some years ago, I interviewed on tape, a top official of the firm that makes
the secret Coca-Cola base. That is Stepan Chemical, headquartered in the
north suburb of Chicago, Northfield, and with plants elsewhere. They are the
largest importer in the western world of coca leaves, used for Coke's base.
A by-product, as admitted by the Stepan boss, is cocaine sold by them to the
pharmaceutical industry.
Does any of it also slip by as contraband?
In the 1970s, some alternative journalists began
heckling cocaine-linked Stepan Chemical. He said he was aware of the
criticism of Stepan regarding cocaine. He could not go into it too far, he
said, because of reasons of "national security". Or did he really mean, "Stepan
security"? The bosses of Stepan have always been close to the Daley family
that since the mid-1950s, with just a short hiatus, runs Chicago's city hall
machine.
Early on in their history, The Coca-Cola Company assisted the U.S. in
espionage. When the company set up bottling plants and distribution
facilities in a new country, sent in were spy operatives. The place to hang
their hat was the offices and plants, worldwide, of the much ballyhooed
drink. The cocaine trace made it addictive. So did the sugar content,
according to some nutritionist. With the U.S. Senate subcommittee hearings
on Iran-Contra late in the 1980,s, the CIA-Coca-Cola link was dealt with.
In Nicaragua, for example, those with CIA, when
the Senate subcommittee asked, where with local offices of The Coca-Cola
Company. By the end of the 20th Century, Coke bought about a billion dollars
a year in advertisements in the monopoly press, even more when you add up
their so-called "independent" subsidiaries.
Coke reportedly uses worldwide, mafia-type strong-arms to assure
distribution and wreck competitors. Such as making soda pop competitors'
refrigerator units in stores to over-night, disappear. In some places it is
the traditional Sicilian and Italian mafia. In other places, former Soviet
Secret Police agents the KGB, like in the U.S. and current Russia, called
the mafia. Elsewhere used reportedly are the numerous Japanese underworld,
the Yakuza.
Feeding on lush revenue of Coke ads, the press whores are not about to run
news items or documentaries pointing out the reportedly close link between
The Coca-Cola Company, covert operations of the American CIA, and the
criminal cartel.
A key player, reportedly combining covert operations and the soda pop, was
Roberto Goizueta. A Cuban, he started with the firm at their Havana offices
in 1954. From 1980 to about the time of his death in 1997, Goizueta was at
the helm of the spy-pop witches brew, operating in most every place on the
globe. Through stock options he became a billionaire.
Goizueta's father was a Cuban sugar plantation dictator. Cuba was the major
source of cane sugar used in the cola drink. Because of the ferment for
change, needed was a new front man in Cuba. Batista, and the mafia, and the
wealthy criminal families sucking the sugar blood out of Cuba, had
overplayed their hand.
So the American CIA, with the help of their
reputed Atlanta-based adjunct, The Coca-Cola Company, installed their
darling, Fidel Castro, a popular hero. When, like Frankenstein's monster, he
turned against his creators, they plotted to overthrow Castro and
assassinate him. It was 1961 and it was called the Bay of Pigs operation.
The Coca-Cola Company and other old-time imperial firms having an entrenched
interest to have Cuba as a puppet colony, participated with CIA. Aiding them
was Claire Boothe Luce, wife of the boss of the Time-Life Magazine empire.
With the American CIA actually since 1959, through his espionage front,
Zapata Petroleum, was
George Herbert Walker Bush.
He aided as well the aborted mission. One of the
attempted invasion vessels was named after Bush's operations. Out of
official government office was Richard Milhous Nixon. In 1961, he was the
overlord for the planned invasion. Blamed for the aborted invasion planned
actually by President Eisenhower, President John F. Kennedy said as a
punishment, he would scatter the CIA to the wind.
CIA boss Allen Dulles, sacked by JFK, called him
a "traitor". Some say the JFK threats against CIA led to the plot to
assassinate him.
Some would simplify this story by pointing to Coke trying to change over
greatly to a diet cola, as a way of breaking loose of filling the void once
supplied by Cuban cane sugar, against which there was a U.S. embargo.
By the
end of the 20th Century, the major player in supplying the chemical
sweeteners for non-Diet Coke, was Archer-Daniels-Midland. At the time of
Watergate, the head of ADM was to have been prosecuted for secret
participation in Nixon's covert operations slush fund. Dwayne Andreas was
too useful to the American CIA for them to allow him to be jailed. Like The
Coca-Cola Company in the past, by 1999, ADM had an interest in putting their
claws on Cuba.
Through foreign subsidiaries, ADM had big investments in operating food
refineries in Cuba, to exploit their agriculture abundance. ADM was the
principal player for the faked propaganda bombardment and orchestrated
event, to open up Cuba and drop the U.S. embargo. It was called the
Elian
Gonzalez affair. Only one lesser known publication dared spell out the
ADM-Cuba-Elian Gonzalez link.
In the spring of 2000, under a headline "How Did
ADM Pull This Off?", The Massachusetts News started their blockbuster item
with,
"What is Archer-Daniels-Midland and why does
it want to build another food refinery in Cuba? Where does it get its
power?"
The article went on to lambast ADM,
"The company is a speculator in and
processor of corn and other grains around the world. It has tremendous
influence on politicians AND THE MEDIA."
So, the Elian Gonzalez affair was just a smoke screen. The story quotes
Forbes Magazine 2/7/2000, and their headline "ADM PREPARES FOR LIFTING OF
CUBAN EMBARGO".
Note: ADM sponsors many of the
mass media's TV talk shows as well as PBS's "Jim Lehrer News Hour".
The story of ADM and The Coca-Cola Company and a corrupt Chicago Federal
Judge will be in a later part of this series.
A major player in The Coca-Cola Company has been Warren Buffet.
If
you are naive and believe in fairy tales, then you believe he made his great
fortune through crafty operation starting with a department store in Omaha.
To heckle him, some of his critics pronounce his name, French-style,
phonetically Buffay. Buffet became a major owner of Coke stock and
held a position on their Board of Directors.
Few, if any, dare even whisper that Buffet's
fortune is reportedly based on operating companies that are money laundries
and propaganda horns for the American CIA.
The list would have to include
CIA adjuncts such as the Wells Fargo Bank, helping CIA's Pacific basin
operations, and the CIA-apologist, The Washington Post Company. (Read, if
you can find it, Deborah Davis' book, "Katherine the Great" about the
Washington Post and the CIA.)
To understand Warren Buffet, who mouths off his wonders at universities
training so-called would-be business stars, you would have to be a profound
investigator, from mostly secret sources, on the worldwide dope trafficking
by the American CIA.
When you are knowledgeable on that, then, and
only then, do you understand the financial buffoon, Warren Buffet.
Is it a
mere coincidence that his purported nephew, Jimmy Buffet, and his rock
concerts seem to be part of making dope use fashionable? His band, The
Corral Reefers, is a word play for narcotics. At his concerts, there is
reportedly massive trafficking and use of dope. And the local corrupted
police have the badge of the three monkeys.
Some had misgivings about another purported relative of Warren Buffet, the
once popular Art Bell, the middle-of-the-night talk show host.
Bell was broadcasted on hundreds of major
wattage radio stations in major markets, never known to broadcast the truth
about the Federal Reserve, or political assassinations, and a lot of other
suppressed topics. With his reputed heavy intelligence agency background,
was Bell's program just some more psychological warfare operations? In crude
terms, was it just mindf - k?
Late in the 20th Century, a strange series of events started
targeting The Coca-Cola Company.
Various European governments and the European
Union began attacking Coke.
-
That Coke's products in Europe are
contaminated. Such as in Belgium and Poland, among others
-
That The Coca-Cola Company uses
monopoly tactics to injure competitors. Such as in Italy
-
Dawn raids on Coke's offices and closing
down their plants, grabbing up records and accusing The Coca-Cola
Company of making people sick with their products
Is there a simple, though incomplete,
unpublicized explanation for this epidemic of attacks on The Coca-Cola
Company?
The French CIA
accused Microsoft of being a spy
operation and proprietary adjunct of the super-secret U.S.
National Security
Agency, the signal intelligence spooks. Further, France and other European
countries are accusing The Coca-Cola Company of being, like Microsoft, an
adjunct and private company proprietary of the American CIA.
Privatizing some of CIA's operations makes it
impossible to get possibly incriminating records, if at all, through
invoking the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. You cannot force government
disclosure, for example, of CIA's private company proprietary adjunct,
Wackenhut, a alter ego for CIA with more employees and operations that CIA
itself. (Spy Magazine, 9/92.)
Further, France and other European countries are accusing Coke of using some
of their methods and satellite operations to assist and as a cover for
Echelon, the super "Big Brother" gobbling up most everyone's private details
and tracking, through key words, what most everyone communicates with anyone
else in the world.
Raiding Coke's European plants and offices - claiming anti-trust violations
and poisoning up the populace - is just another way of sending the
Atlanta-based spy/soda-spitting rattlesnake the message:
We do not like American spies and vipers.
Part 2
Coca-Cola's reputed spies and the corrupt Federal Witness
Protection Program
August 14, 2000
First, a short lesson in court corruption.
How do a series of secretly related court cases get onto the docket of one
Judge? As a case is in the process of being filed in the federal district
court clerk's office, the case, under the rules, is supposed to be assigned
by random selection, "blind-man's buff" they used to call it.
But, after studying and investigating court
corruption for over 40 years, I know the term to be used is RANDOM MAGIC.
One of the first things we probe when we are on the trail of a tainted or
suspicious case is: How did THIS particular case get on THAT judge's docket?
We know from long experience, corruption starts with the assignment of
cases. Another tell-tale sign is when THAT judge uses JUDICIAL PERJURY to
"fix" the case in favor of a certain litigant.
A judge under a malign if not corrupt influence
inserts false so-called "facts" plucked out of the sky and not in the court
evidence to justify their decision. In simplistic terms, the undisputed
court evidence shows it is DAY. Operating under a corrupt influence, the
judge proclaims it is NIGHT, and applies case law regarding NIGHT to support
her decision.
Judges operate by case law, that is, by prior landmark rulings
or statutes which cannot obviously be changed or sidestepped that easily. So
the corrupted judge changes the "facts" and applies case law to fraudulent
facts.
That in essence is judicial perjury. Not every
case is the subject of malign influence. But, often the important ones are.
Over the years, when we suspected a judge was corrupt, we examined their
rulings to see if there are judicial perjuries. An honest judge, mis-stating
the undisputed facts, would quickly correct wrong statements. A crooked
judge, even when confronted (cowardly lawyers are chicken), refuses.
Of the more than two dozen judges sitting in Chicago's U.S. District Court,
one judge, by some witchcraft, has assigned to her a string of cases with
apparent concealed links.
That is Judge Blanche M. Manning
[(312)435-7608]. Among these, she has assigned to her, by apparent RANDOM
MAGIC, the case of Robert E. Kolody vs. Simon Marketing and The
Coca-Cola Company, No. 97 C 190.
For a number of years Kolody planned to sue Coke
for stealing his intellectual property, designs he made for them. Kolody's
confidant, who befriended him over the years and insinuated himself into the
matter for some 10 years has been a local lawyer who was always sympathetic
to Kolody's grievances against Coca-Cola and their adjunct, Simon Marketing.
When Kolody retained an out-of-state attorney
from Arkansas to represent him in 1998, the rules required the designation
of an additional lawyer as "local counsel". That trusted "local counsel" was
Kolody's long-time confidant Daniel V. Hanley, [(708)474-6633], of
the Chicago suburb of Lansing, Illinois.
All of Kolody's legal strategies and plans and those of his Arkansas lawyer,
Dan Ivy, were discussed in confidence with Daniel V. Hanley. But strange
things were happening. Coke's lawyers seemed to be able to "beat to the
punch" Kolody and Dan Ivy, that is, heading off Kolody and Ivy's legal
strategies which, of course, are confidential and not to be divulged by his
"local counsel" Daniel V. Hanley.
And Judge Blanche M. Manning arrogantly committed judicial perjuries, which
some common people call straight out lies about what this copyright case was
all about. The Judge evidently knew that she did not have to be careful. She
refused to wipe out her judicial perjuries when confronted by Dan Ivy.
As an electronic journalist, on May 18,2000, I attended a hearing before
Judge Manning when she failed to do anything about her judicial perjuries in
the Coca-Cola case.
Afterwards elsewhere in the courthouse in the
presence of Ivy, I interviewed Daniel V. Hanley:
"Skolnick: What sort of law work do you do,
Mr. Hanley?
Daniel V. Hanley: General.
Skolnick: As you know I do for many years now a Cable TV Show each week.
Hanley: Yes, I know.
Skolnick: Do Coca-Cola and their attorneys know the legal strategy of
Robert Kolody and his attorney Dan Ivy here?
Hanley: Yes.
Skolnick: Really? How could they know?
Hanley: My sister is the media buyer for Coca-Cola.
Skolnick: What does she do?
Hanley: She has been with a New York firm and now is in Chicago.
Skolnick: What firm is she with?
Hanley: (looked at Skolnick but did not answer.)
Skolnick: Do you think putting Bob here on my TV program about Coca-Cola
would do any good?
Hanley: No.
Skolnick: So your sister understands all about this case?
Hanley: Yes.
Whereupon, Daniel V. Hanley left and Skolnick
spoke to Dan Ivy:
Skolnick: Did you hear what Hanley
volunteered as a statement? (Kolody had come over to the table and heard
the portion, he said, of the colloquy where Daniel V. Hanley said his
sister is media buyer for Coca-Cola.)
Dan Ivy: Yes, and we are shocked.
Skolnick: Well, this needs further investigation now that he volunteered
this statement."
After another court hearing on July 6, 2000,
when again Judge Manning failed to take back her judicial perjuries, I
attended in court and interviewed Hanley again in the presence of Dan Ivy.
"Skolnick: So, do you think putting Bob on
my TV Show will do some good?
Hanley: No. The time to put him on would have been two years ago at the
time of the summary judgment. It's too late now.
Skolnick: So Coca-Cola understands all about this case, through your
sister.
Hanley: Yes.
Whereupon, Hanley left."
The foregoing transcripts are contained in my
signed Declaration attached to Kolody's Motion for the Judge to wipe out all
her rulings of substance because of the Fraud Upon the Court by the Judge
and Coca-Cola's spy in Kolody's camp for ten years. [Motion filed 8/9/2000,
in No. 97 C 190.]
As I later discovered, Daniel V. Hanley's sister, Mary Hanley, is Associate
Media Director [(312) 552-6368] of the huge,
worldwide advertising firm,
DDB. [Visit their website: http://www.ddb.com and click on their world
directory of personnel for Chicago and Mary Hanley.]
As I put in my Declaration in Court:
"The long-term custom, practice, and usage,
in certain parts of the U.S. to purportedly purchase federal judgeships,
has been a subject of investigations and commentaries by Skolnick and
his closest associates, from 1966 to the present date. Skolnick has such
a commentary on his website,
http://www.skolnicksreport.com
Knowledgeable sources have informed Skolnick
that the upwards of one million dollars to purportedly purchase the
judgeship for Blanche M. Manning came from William F. Cellini via U.S.
Senator Carol Moseley-Braun. Law enforcement personnel contend to
Skolnick that Cellini, heavily active in gambling casinos, is reportedly
a key player in the crime cartel."
More details from my court
Declaration:
"Skolnick jointly with some of his
associates in court reform, have been investigating the circumstances of
a case pending before Judge Manning: USA vs. Joseph Jerome Miedzianowski,
et al., defendants, No. 98 CR 923, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of Illinois, Eastern Division. The circumstances show:
-
Judge
Manning, many times without notice conducted closed door and secret
proceedings in the case
-
ordered the censoring, by redacting of
court and other transcripts
-
Chicago Tribune Company petitioned, to
intervene in the case as of right, for among other purposes, for access
to sealed judicial records and transcripts of proceedings
-
Chicago
Tribune apparently never publicly disclosed their objections to the
secret proceedings in the case. Some references to this situation are
contained in the case in No.98 CR 923, among other items, docket items
No. 174, 175, 176 , 180, 182, 186, 192."
More:
"Informed sources contend that this
situation is due, in part, to matters actually or bordering on so-called
'national security', in that involved in the trafficking of dope into
Chicago from Florida and elsewhere was the use of dope couriers or
'mules' as they are known, of persons, some of them women, who also did
work for the espionage agencies."
More:
"Daniel V. Hanley has also been the attorney
for Danny Harkenrider, who owns and operates Shannon's Landing, an Irish
Pub, located with the property of the Chicago suburban airport in
Lansing, Illinois.
The place has been a reputed center for dope
trafficking, including through airplanes. Nothing is done about this by
the usual dope enforcement authorities. FBI Division Five,
Counter-Intelligence, has informed the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, and other state and federal agencies, to take no action
against the dope traffic.
The excuse being that the FBI purportedly is
tracking clandestine IRS activities through the airport and the said
Pub; activities to raise funds for the IRS and gun-smuggling through the
dope traffic. Harkenrider has had purported immunity in these acts and
doings in that's his sister, Mary Yokich, was at one time on the third
level from the top of the U.S. Justice Department, engaged in special
investigations including involved in the Oklahoma City bombings.
Some contend the Justice Department and the
FBI, to avoid embarrassing details coming out, suppressed details of the
tragedy. Mary Yokich's father-in-law is head of the powerful United Auto
Workers union which in the past has through international affiliates,
assisted the American CIA in covert operations against unions deemed
unfriendly to American corporate interests worldwide."
It is clear that Judge Manning is busy covering
up high-level corrupt government officials implicated in the dope traffic
through the Chicago Police as in the Miedzianowski case.
Another case assigned to Judge Manning by RANDOM
MAGIC, is the case of USA vs. John Serpico, et al., No.99 CR 570. The
defendants are labor bosses charged with racketeering, frauds and swindles,
bank fraud, among other things. Through her apparent cover-ups, Judge
Manning is keeping out of the federal court record that Serpico has a
business partner who is a top official of the Federal Witness Protection
Program.
Some claim that these gangster-like connections
have caused several supposedly protected witnesses to be murdered by inside
complicity. Thus high-level corrupt federal officials, including IRS
officials in Chicago, are kept from being fingered because the witnesses
against them are being murdered INSIDE THE FEDERAL WITNESS PROTECTION
PROGRAM.
Well-informed sources contend that one of the reasons Daniel V. Hanley
volunteered the statement mentioned is that Hanley and his client,
Harkenrider, are reportedly in the Federal Witness Protection Program, or
being considered to be taken in under the criteria set forth in the U.S.
Justice Department Manual under the Witness Security Reform Act of 1984
jointly with other laws.
Sources contend that Hanley and Harkenrider,
because of their activities at the Irish Pub, at the Lansing, Illinois
Airport, are being threatened from all sides:
-
by the IRA not to co-operate with FBI
Counter-Intelligence, Division Five, as protected witnesses
-
by their knowledge that Judge Manning is
keeping out of the federal court record in several of her cases, the
corrupt operation of the Federal Witness Protection Program, and
that Hanley and Harkenrider cannot expect to be actually protected
as witnesses
-
by The Coca-Cola Company, in that they
have had an entrenched spy in the camp of a major copyright case,
where Robert E. Kolody is suing Coca-Cola and their marketing
adjunct Simon Marketing now merged with a firm called Cryk
-
by various corporate interests whose
planes apparently convey dope in and out of the Lansing, Illinois
airport with impunity, with state and federal authorities playing
the part of the three monkeys
-
and threatened by the Drug Enforcement
Administration agents who often occupy a table at Shannon's Landing
and also play the part of the three monkeys
It is perhaps ironic that the only
non-threatening type that Hanley could confess to is Sherman H. Skolnick, a
long-known, independent-minded court reformer and Cable TV Talk Show
moderator/producer.
Much more about Chicago Federal District Judge
Blanche M. Manning and the highly-corrupt Federal Witness Protection Program
involved in a string of cases she is covering up.
Part 3
August 15, 2000
This series is dealing with the type of harsh realities uncovered by our
research and investigation group over 4 arduous decades of our work.
-
Sometimes whole groups of court cases
are assigned, not by random selection, but random magic,
intentionally to one or more judges part of "big fix". And involved
is a malign, if not corrupt, influence upon the judge. Knowing who
it is that bought the chair for the Judge is one type of influence.
Straight out bribery, another. And the
major corruption, as we have repeatedly shown, is not in the state
courts, but the big bucks federal courts. We have been showing as an
example a group of cases assigned to Chicago U.S. District Judge
Blanche M. Manning [(312) 435-7608. FAX: (312) 435-7578.]
We have more details on her. And she is
not the only one, just an example of the corrupted federal
judiciary.
-
Worldwide, major enterprises are secret
adjuncts of the American CIA. Privatizing the spy agency avoids
Freedom of Information disclosures. One example is Wackenhut. An
example dealt with here is The Coca-Cola Company.
-
Government agencies are supposedly set
up to protect witnesses from harm in very sensitive case. For
instance, the Federal Witness Protection Program. But they seem to
have been penetrated by criminal interests, so that key witnesses,
that finger corruption of top IRS and DEA officials, are NOT
protected, but terrorized, and on occasion, snuffed out.
As we have specified, Judge Manning is
covering up this situation in the case of USA vs. John Serpico et
al., No. 99 CR 570. Serpico, a union purported criminal boss, is
reportedly a business partner with a top official of the Federal
Witness Protection Program.
-
There are places that operate reportedly
as a criminal immunity zone. Anything goes. The state and federal
authorities play the part of the three monkeys. One such that seems
to fit that description, reportedly is a business on the property of
the Lansing, Illinois Airport, a suburb of Chicago.
Called Shannon's Landing [(708)
895-6919], it is an Irish pub. Who seems to use that place? Corrupt
top IRS officials blackmailing their way into all kinds of deals.
[Visit our website series on the crooked IRS bosses and their
ocean-going money laundry boat, "California Rose".]
Dope traffic through the airplanes there
and such is used reportedly to raise funds for gun-smuggling, for
purposes of the Irish Republican Army, IRA. Agents of the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration often sit at that pub and hear and see
nothing.
The owner of the pub, Danny Harkenrider,
is reportedly himself in the Federal Witness Protection Program or
being considered under the criteria for such. Another one in that
program reportedly or being considered for such, is a purported
lawyer {he does not seem to practice much law), Daniel V. Hanley, of
Lansing, Illinois [(708) 474-6633].
Hanley is a purported spy inside the camp of a fellow, Robert E.
Kolody, who sued Coke for theft of storyboards and designs, that is,
his intellectual property. Apparently threatened from all sides,
Hanley as the supposed "local counsel" for Kolody, confessed and
volunteered to me, in the presence of witnesses, that Kolody's court
opponent, The Coca-Cola Company, gets to know his confidential legal
strategies through Hanley's sister, Mary Hanley, who is the media
buyer for Coca-Cola. She is with a huge worldwide advertising agency
in Chicago, DDB [(312) 552-6368. FAX: (312) 552-2394. E-Mail:
MaryHanley@chi.ddb.com].
-
Federal judgeships, like state
judgeships, are bought and sold. A known reputed criminal type
bought Judge Blanche M. Manning the federal judge's bench and chair
she occupies in the U.S. District Court in Chicago. [Visit our
website for our story on Buying Judgeships.] A million dollars or
more was laid out.
-
A major dope trafficking case, by random
magic, was assigned to Judge Manning. She covered up the involvement
of "mules", dope couriers, some of them women, who also do espionage
for the American CIA. USA vs. Joseph Jerome Miedzianowski et al.,
No. 98 CR 923. The Chicago Tribune are fakers.
As shown in the court record they are
privately blackmailing Judge Manning, lambasting her for holding
without notice or formalities, secret proceedings, censoring court
transcripts and papers. Why does the WORLD'S GREEDIEST NEWSPAPER
remain silent about all this in print or on their TV Station in
Chicago, Channel 9, WGN-TV, or on their radio horn WGN Radio?
-
In an extremely important anti-trust
conspiracy case assigned to her, again by random magic, Judge
Manning tried to go easy on top officials found guilty by a jury;
top officials, that is, of the worldwide farm products refinery,
Archer-Daniels-Midland. ADM is a super-duper advetiser in the
monopoly press and controls numerous TV talk shows and such.
They have as their puppet the "Jim
Lehrer News Hour" on PBS. And ADM is big with supposedly
"non-commercial" radio stations, NPR. Since a Rockefeller holds the
key position with NPR, we call them National Petroleum Radio.
ADM, like Coca-Cola years ago, is trying
to put a grab on Cuba's agriculture by forcing the U.S. to drop the
embargo.
By the way, the whole Elian Gonzalez Affair,
played out on the ADM-dominated monopoly press, was to soften up the
American know-nothings for ADM's scheme being big investments in Cuba in
food refineries to take advantage of Cuba's agriculture abundance.
Working on the other side of this propaganda
trick reportedly was Jose Basulto, reportedly tied to the criminal combine
that includes the family of George Herbert Walker Bush and his
criminal-linked, oil-soaked sons. And linked to the American CIA.
The case of the ADM officials is USA vs. Michael D. Andreas, Terrance S.
Wilson, and Mark E. Whitacre. Michael is the son of the long-time ADM
dictator Dwayne Andreas who should have gone to jail in the Watergate
Affair.
The government whistle-blower, Whitacre, himself an ADM official,
wore a wire, and aided the FBI in setting up clandestine video and audio
recording of the monopoly crimes. He was done in apparently with the
connivance - here it comes again - of the Federal Witness Protection
Program. It is case No. 96 CR 762.
After a jury verdict finding the defendants guilty, Judge Manning
nevertheless gave a light sentence to Andreas and Wilson and a more severe
jail sentence to the whistle-blower, Whitacre, to scare such finger-pointers
to shut up in the future or be dropped down the chute by the
criminal-combine running the Federal Witness Protection Program.
And as mentioned, Judge Manning in various cases
is covering up the criminals supposedly dedicated to protecting government
witnesses, actually persecuting and terrorizing key government witnesses. If
that does not work, well, snuffing out witnesses is also the answer.
Whitacre rots in jail...
In June, 2000, the banker-judges on the federal appeals court in Chicago,
did their own blackmail job on Judge Manning. They publicly ran over her in
the case of Andreas and Wilson. They want to be sure she stays shut on the
corrupted Federal Witness Protection Program in the several cases put on her
docket by random magic.
The appeals judges, primarily tied to the
Rockefeller interests and not ADM, slapped her down, saying she gave too
light of jail sentences to Andreas and Wilson, and sent it back for her to
fix it up. Whitacre was not part of the appeal and is left as a
thrown-in-the-garbage whistle-blower.
ADM supplies the corn and other sweeteners to The Coca-Cola Company. So you
see the common link to the cases on Judge Manning's docket. ADM is a
spy-apparatus themselves, just like Coke. In 1989, ADM wanted to put an
arm-lock on the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
They were countered by the independent-minded
young "pirates" who as speculators were running the places. ADM arranged to
"buy" the federal prosecutors office to frame up 46 of these "pirates" on
measly five dollar discrepancy matters. In an unusual procedure, ADM
supplied to the federal government prosecutors undercover spies, trained by
and for ADM in commodity and other dealing.
ADM's undercover provocateurs got "evidence" of
the five dollar matters which was and is a common, accepted practice on the
exchanges, not considered a crime at all. The federal prosecutors,
practically on ADM's payroll instead of Uncle Sam's, destroyed the 46 young
people quicker than shooting them.
In 1992, I was sitting in my wheelchair in the front of the front row of the
packed courtroom of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago. Before the oral
presentation of the appeals, I tried to tell the wives of some of the
Soybean Ten, that the three-judge panel to hear the appeal, was headed by a
conflict of interest.
That was Federal Appeals Judge Richard D.
Cudahy. According to his mandatory financial disclosure, he is the
richest judge in North America and owns and operates the Patrick Cudahy
Trust, which is a speculation instrument in the commodity industry. Judge
Cudahy upheld the severe jail sentences of the soybean traders.
The relatives of the doomed speculators had hired, for about a million
dollars, Alan Dershowitz, to argue their appeal. Before the hearing, when I
tried to warn the relatives, they just insulted me:
"Who the hell are you, Mr. Skolnick? I
answered, I am just a voice for justice in the wilderness, that's all."
Hey, maybe you are floored by all these details.
Maybe I should not tell you that the Russian mafia plays a part in some of
Judge Manning's crooked decisions.
Like Harkenrider is purportedly in with them.
Part 4
Is the media monster, the Tribune Company,
a reputed blackmailer of The Coca-Cola Company?
August 21, 2000
Here is more that is boiling and bubbling out of
that witches brew of a scandal implicating Coca-Cola.
For background to this story, you should visit
our website story about the Chicago Tribune linked to the criminal cartel,
at least from 1910 to date, including the Trib using Al Capone as a labor
consultant in 1930 to beat back a strike against the Tribune, and then
again, in 1986, using gangster goons with attack dogs against the Trib's own
workers in a labor strike.
With a charter for their Canadian pulp from the King of England more than a
100 years ago, and large ownership currently by the Queen of England and her
dope traffickers, the Tribune Company are no angels. Neither are the
Coca-Cola Company as an adjunct worldwide of the American CIA.
The one who got in the middle between the
Tribune Company and Coca-Cola is Chicago U.S. District Judge Blanche M.
Manning [(312) 435-7608]. In a theft of intellectual property case pending
against Coca-Cola, Judge Manning has issued a series of "judicial
perjuries", as some call them, to corruptly favor Coke. [Robert E. Kolody
vs. Simon Marketing and The Coca-Cola Company, 97 C 190.]
Plain-spoken folks call such things straight out lies by the Judge. In
August, 2000, Judge Manning was confronted with a situation involving a spy
infiltrating the camp of Coke's court opponent, Kolody, thus becoming privy
to Kolody's confidential legal strategies against Coke. How did this happen,
as identified in the Court record?
Following a court hearing, I interviewed
Kolody's required "local counsel" in the presence of Kolody's out-of-state
counsel Dan Ivy:
"Skolnick: Does Coca-Cola and their
attorneys know the legal strategies of Robert Kolody and his attorney
Dan Ivy here? Local counsel Daniel V. Hanley [(708) 474-6633]: Yes.
Skolnick: Really? How could they know? Hanley: My sister is the media
buyer for Coca-Cola."
[Portion of transcript of interview attached
to Motion for Relief Because of Fraud Upon the Court, filed 8/9/00. The
term "fraud upon the court" is a profound principle of law that
frightens cowardly members of the bar and corrupt members of the bench.
It requires that the rulings on matters of substance by a judge acting
under a malign, if not corrupt, influence, be expunged from the court
record.]
When I run into savvy cynics in or near
courthouses, they just cackle.
"Skolnick, you have often documented such
problems. How can there be a fraud upon the District Court in places
like Chicago, a court that is a long-known fraud itself?"
To try to get around Kolody's Motion for Relief
Because of Fraud Upon the Court, Judge Manning issued a decision giving the
Motion a false label, calling it a motion to disqualify the Judge.
There is no such thing in the Motion. But this
is typical of judges operating under a malign, if not corrupt, influence. [A
gambling casino kingpin, reportedly part of the criminal cartel, reportedly
paid one million dollars to BUY the federal judgeship for Manning. As stated
in the filed Motion. See
Buying a Judgeship.]
And falsely calling the Motion by that name, Judge Manning said Kolody did
not properly invoke the federal statutes for disqualifying a judge. So the
Judge said Kolody's Motion is no good. Any one examining the Court record
could see the Judge is a plain rotten liar.
In another case on Judge Manning's docket, the Tribune Company has been
blackmailing the Judge. In a moment you will understand why. It is a case of
a dope-trafficking gang, Chicago-Florida, involving Chicago police and dope
"mules" or couriers, actually many of them women also working for the
American CIA.
The Tribune filed a petition in the case saying
they should be allowed to intervene as of right. Why? Because, says the
Tribune, Judge Manning is conducting, without notice or legal formality,
secret court proceedings. And Judge Manning is censoring court documents and
transcripts, by redacting them, and similar secret methods. Judge Manning's
apparent purpose?
To cover up the dope trafficking showing complicity by
corrupt top-level IRS officials, and the kinky U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, and the corrupted FBI, among others. [Visit
our web series
on corrupt IRS brass and their ocean-going money laundry boat.]
The dope trafficking case is USA vs. Joseph Jerome Miedzianowski, et al.,
No. 98 CR 923, U.S. District Court, Chicago.
According to advertising agency sources, The Tribune Company, as a media
empire, has a beef against The Coca-Cola Company which is being corruptly
favored by Judge Manning with her paper tricks. [Kolody vs. Simon Marketing
and The Coca-Cola Company, No. 97 C 190.]
The Tribune Company is sore at Coke because
Coke's media buyer, Mary Hanley, reportedly is not favoring Trib and their
raft of newspapers, TV and radio stations and such, with the proper amount
of advertising bucks. Get this straight: the Tribune, no crusaders against
corrupt federal judges, does not wish to assist Kolody but rather to
strong-arm Coke.
Just after the Fraud Upon the Court Motion is filed, Mary Hanley's boss, the
monstrous DDB advertising octopus, announces, in the Chicago Tribune, that
Mary Hanley has been promoted to Senior Vice President and is group media
director at DDB Chicago. [Chicago Tribune, George Lazarus' column, 8/15/00.]
It appears that DDB is playing the part of press agent, to try to get the
stink off the mess.
And guess what? To further get away from the ruckus, Coca-Cola's media
buyer, Mary Hanley, identified as such by her lawyer-brother, just at that
point, is leaving the U.S. for Ireland. [Mary Hanley: (312) 552-6368. Email:
MaryHanley@chi.ddb.com]
By the way, reportedly arranging such propaganda is an apparatus we call The
Banquet Committee, suddenly honoring someone, such as person of the year and
such, to counter a scandal. More later.
We have, by the way, been commenting for some 40 years about media units
blackmailing slow-to-comply would-be advertisers.
The late George Seldes, a crusading
journalist, wrote about this type of blackmailing in his book, "Tell The
Truth and Run". Since 1991, in our public access Cable TV Program in
Chicago, we have spelled out numerous examples of press-fakers using
blackmail to strong-arm ads. That is, threatening to run negative stories
about a corporation if they fail to buy plenty of ads.
In simple terms, the Tribune Company wants The Coca-Cola Company to throw
more ad bucks its way. And twisting Judge Manning's crooked arm [maybe even
Mary Hanley's arm] is the way to start the finger pointing leading to
loosening up Coke's billion dollar a year advertising bankroll.
[Some years
ago, we showed how a local TV station in Chicago, Channel 5, WMAQ-TV, an NBC
unit, did a series scandalizing Sears Roebuck & Co., basically because Sears
was holding back ad bucks.]
And get this angle: The Miedzianowski case secretly involves the American
CIA, details covered up by Judge Manning. The background of many of the
Tribune Company's correspondents and such is that they come out of U.S.
Military Intelligence, the CIA's competitor. So the Tribune Company has a
number of reasons to privately blackmail Chicago U.S. District Judge Blanche
M. Manning.
Sarcastic sorts crow, if Coke does not bubble up with more ads for the
Tribune Company - well, Tribune may order any Coke machines to suddenly
disappear from Trib's premises. Or sternly order Tribune employees to drink
Royal Crown Cola instead. NOT Pepsi-Cola, falsely described as a
"competitor" of Coke, yet Coke and Pepsi are run and owned by the same
folks.
Ha ha. Stories like this take the fizz out of
the soda monster.
Part 5
The Blackmail Machine Rolls On
August 21, 2000
It was set to be a crucial hearing in the
media-ignored Coca-Cola case in Chicago's federal district court.
U.S. District Judge Blanche M. Manning
[(312) 435-7608] was determined NOT to hear in open court on August 22,
2000, that Coca-Cola had a reputed spy in the camp of their opponent, Robert
E. Kolody, who was suing Coke for theft of his storyboards and designs. In
law, his claim is called theft of intellectual property.
The monopoly press, beholden to major advertiser Coca-Cola, has purposely
evaded reporting on this case.
Kolody's out-of-state attorney, Dan Ivy, had
on August 9, bravely filed a Motion demanding the Judge expunge all her
rulings favoring Coke, since the reputed spy reportedly conveyed
confidential legal strategies of Kolody to his opponent, Coke.
It is called Fraud Upon the Court, an unusual
procedure that makes most of those of the bench and the bar plenty nervous.
Kolody's required "local counsel", Daniel V. Hanley, the reputed spy, in the
presence of witnesses, had confessed to me that Coca-Cola knew Kolody's
court strategies because Hanley's sister is media buyer for Coca-Cola.
The court-filed Motion with my signed Declaration attached, among other
things, pointed out:
-
That power-broker, and gambling casino
overlord, WILLIAM F. CELLINI, reportedly paid one million dollars to
buy in 1994 the federal court judgeship for Blanche M. Manning. The
pay-off reportedly made through then-U.S. Senator Carol
Moseley-Braun. [Braun lost the re-election in 1998 because of
growing scandals she could not explain away. As to Buying a
Judgeship, visit my website.] Cellini reportedly is linked to the
nationwide criminal cartel.
-
My Declaration transcribed two
interviews, done in the presence of witnesses, of Daniel V. Hanley.
-
That the Tribune Company, parent of the
Chicago Tribune, and their media empire, have been blackmailing
Judge Manning by seeking to intervene, as of right they claimed,
without publicity, in another one of Judge Manning's cases.
To point out that the Judge engaged in secret
proceedings without notice, and censored and redacted court records, as part
of an apparent cover-up.
As later determined, the Tribune Company wanted
to pressure Judge Manning, and Coke's media buyer, MARY HANLEY, so Tribune
would get more advertising bucks from Coca-Cola. With the merger with the
Los Angeles Times, Tribune Company got more heavily in debt. Getting a big
share of Coke's billion dollars a year advertising slush fund would help
Tribune Company and their banks.
Prior to the show-down August 22 hearing, Judge Manning jumped the gun and
rejected the Fraud Upon the Court Motion out of hand. The Judge issued a
ruling loaded with what Dan Ivy later on August 22, described in court to
her face, as her "judicial perjuries". Identified by Dan Ivy were how, to
try to cover up and evade, the Fraud Upon the Court, involving the Judge
herself, that she straight out lied.
The Judge falsely described the Motion as one to
disqualify herself. No such thing in the Motion. Ivy confronted the Judge
with a string of her lies. The Judge resisted allowing the witnesses against
the reputed spy to be heard. The witnesses were all present in the
courtroom.
Notice the time-line: Prior to the key hearing, Daniel V. Hanley informed
Kolody that Hanley's sister, Coke media buyer Mary Hanley, is going out of
the country, to Ireland.
Would she be available as a witness? Her testimony
could scandalize her company, DDB advertising agency, in matters that
involve both Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. [More later.] Prior to the key
hearing, in a business column 8/15/00, in the Chicago Tribune, it is
announced that Mary Hanley of DDB Chicago has been elected Senior Vice
President and is a group media director.
By the way, as Coke's media buyer, Mary Hanley has tremendous clout as to
who in the mass media get part of Coke's billion dollars a year ad bucks.
After resisting hearing the witnesses, Judge Manning suddenly leaves the
bench, presumably to get instructions from "higher ups". In the recess, six
federal security patrol officers enter the Courtroom. An excuse supposedly
is that the Judge will briefly divert a few minutes to sentence a jail-bird,
in an orange prison jumpsuit, brought in through a side door.
After the brief diversion, however, the federal
police do not leave. Judge Manning then tries to intimidate me demanding I
roll my wheelchair to the rear of the courtroom. I told her I am an
electronic journalist and wish to be upfront to observe and hear good. One
of the federal police stands up and started over to me, to forcibly remove
me.
Under threat, I rolled over to sit right near
one of the federals with his intercom in his ear.
Suddenly the Judge changes her mind and the witnesses were called such as
me. I was asked what I do. Looking right at Judge Manning, I told her I
investigate crooked judges for the purpose of putting them in jail. Pointing
to the reputed spy for Coca-Cola who confessed to me in the presence of
others, I detailed what was said. The reputed spy did not, however, appear
to deny my interviews with him about his sister.
In the Kolody case, the two defendants are The Coca-Cola Company and their
marketing adjunct, Simon Marketing. Simon's alleged attorney was asked why
she did not inform the Court that Simon had merged and is now part of Cyrk,
Inc. The attorney, Jacqueline A. Criswell [law firm Tressler, Soderstrom,
Maloney & Priess(312) 627-4000] told Judge Manning that she did not know of
the merger.
Apparently not adequately revealed in the Court record is that Criswell does
NOT represent Simon Marketing but rather, the insurance carrier under an
errors and omission policy carried by many corporations. And the name of the
insurance company has not been disclosed in the Court record. Also, Cyrk has
reportedly failed to inform the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of
the Kolody suit as required by SEC regulations.
From all the known facts, it appears that there may be a scam underway to
rip off the insurance carrier. No great surprise. Illinois and Texas are
havens for pirate insurance companies and havens for massive insurance
frauds, because of crooked state insurance regulators.
Coke appears to be fraudulently shifting the
multi-million dollar damage claim against them, for theft of intellectual
property, so their former marketing adjunct, Simon, would take the blame to
be underwritten by the insurance company.
Coca-Cola's advertising agency DDB, may be part of a huge price-fixing and
market-tampering mess. Advertising agencies become privy to tremendous
financial and political secrets of their clients. Such as: the market
demographics. Data on profiling would-be customers. Price trends. Political
trends that effect marketing products. Problems needed to be "fixed" and
judges and others necessary to be corrupted, for the benefit of their
clients.
Where the product sells the best, so as to put a
related business unit right nearby. Point-of-purchase strategies.
Closely scrutinizing
DDB's website is helpful: http://www.ddbn.com
DDB, once called Needham, has been trying to stay low-key on the fact that
they represent PEPSI-COLA at the same time they represent their alleged
"competitor" COCA-COLA.
That sort of an arrangement is both unethical
and may well be a violation of the U.S. Anti-Trust laws. The purpose is to
freeze out smaller companies like Royal Crown Cola and others, with Pepsi
and Coke together controlling the prices among themselves, dividing up
markets among themselves, setting the wholesale price per-case of soda pop
in a way to screw smaller firms, and then jacking up the price for
themselves, and similar federal price-fixing and market-fixing law
violations.
An open secret, never mentioned in the monopoly
press, is that Coke and Pepsi are substantially owned and operated by the
same people.
Two days after the key hearing on Coke's reputed spy, the Chicago Tribune
continues their Blackmail Machine. The apparent purpose is not to help
Robert E. Kolody fight the injustice inflicted on him by Judge Manning but
rather, for the Tribune Company to continue to shakedown Coke's advertising
agency, DDB, to get more ad bucks for the Tribune empire of numerous print
media newspapers, TV stations, radio stations, magazines, and a great number
of advertising-sponsored websites.
The Trib blackmail story was on their front page, 8/24/2000. The Tribune
announced a matter that had so far been kept secret: That there had been a
huge Illinois State contract swindle prosecution that actually involved top
officials of then-Illinois Governor Jim Edgar [1991-1999]:
"The list of those linked by prosecutors to
the scandal but not charged included Michael Belletire, Edgar's deputy
chief of staff and later head of the ILLINOIS GAMING BOARD; JANIS
CELLINI, Edgar's patronage chief AND SISTER OF SPRINGFIELD POWER BROKER
WILLIAM CELLINI..."
Notice the tie-in to the Coca-Cola case:
A
gambling casino kingpin, reputedly part of the nationwide crime cartel, William F. Cellini, reportedly bought the Judgeship for Blanche M.
Manning sitting in the Coca-Cola case.
One of those reportedly covering up dirty
business in gambling casinos for Cellini what later became head of the
Illinois Gambing Board is now named as having been an unindicted
co-conspirator.
That is, the prosecutor, splitting hairs because of being
corrupted or otherwise influenced, left him off the hook. And then the
Tribune names William F. Cellini's sister, JANIS CELLINI, as one who somehow
escaped being actually prosecuted and jailed.
Do you suppose that William F. Cellini and the Coca-Cola gang and their ad
bucks controller DDB, and Mary Hanley, media buyer for Coca-Cola, along with
Judge Manning, got the message? See to it, they are told, that the Tribune
Company gets their "cut" of the Coke billion dollars a year ad bucks, or
else, more judicial dirt and Cellini scandals will be published.
So what is next? The WORLD GREEDIEST NEWSPAPER suddenly and belatedly
finding out that there is an insurance scam reportedly implicating a
marketing adjunct of Coca-Cola?
Or that DDB advertising agency is concealing an
apparent horrendous price-fixing mess involving both Pepsi and Coke?
Part 6
Anatomy Of The Big Court Fix
September 5, 2000
One of the hardest things to understand for
poorly informed folks is that the law and the facts are not the controlling
factors in important cases in Court.
Mind you, not every case is corrupted or
"fixed". Too often, however, the big ones show signs there has been a
malign, if not corrupt, influence on the Judge or Judges involved.
Our court reform group, targeting court corruption, has been active for four
decades. We know what to look for. The assignment of cases, is, to us, a key
sign.
We have been writing and commenting, and did a one-hour Cable TV Program, on
the corruption in the case against The Coca-Cola Company, in Chicago's
notorious federal district court. With no exceptions, every judgeship in the
place has been bought and sold over the years. [Visit our website story,
Buying a Judgeship.]
The case against Coca-Cola was brought in January, 1997, by a Nebraska
attorney, John DeCamp, with long prior experience with the American
CIA. [The plaintiff, Robert E. Kolody, found it difficult to get a local
attorney.] DeCamp was in a position to understand plenty. He was in a
position to know that this important case in Chicago, involving claims
against the soda pop monster for theft of intellectual property, storyboards
and designs, would be difficult to continue.
Any plaintiff's attorney might get chewed up and
spit out, especially by Coca-Cola, a worldwide adjunct and proprietary
operation of the American CIA.
By the corrupt process of random magic, instead of random selection, the
Coca-Cola case was assigned to Chicago U.S. District Judge Blanche M.
Manning [(312) 435-7608].
And the road to reportedly blackmailing her, to
favor Coca-Cola, was already built. Running on that road was waste hauler
John Christopher who had a criminal past with reputed ties to organized
crime. He agreed to be an FBI "mole" and to wear a "wire" to target some of
Chicago's City Officials, known as "the best that money can buy".
The
FBI/U.S. Justice Department project was dubbed "Silver Shovel".
Screwing the residents in their own districts
with poisonous waste, various city council Aldermen took apparent pay-offs
or reportedly extorted pay-offs from Christopher, so he could illegally dump
huge waste in their neighborhoods. Left-over construction junk. This was
primarily or exclusively in poor black areas, with an empty lot or two,
areas without financial or political clout.
By the way, after the FBI dust had settled, the
U.S. Government did NOT quickly offer to haul away all the toxic mess that
Christopher unloaded, often right near populated inner city areas.
"Silver Shovel" was a headlined scandal in the local press starting about
January, 1996.
By the time the Coca-Cola case got started a
year later, City of Chicago Commissioner of Water, John Bolden, was
targeted for federal criminal prosecution in "Silver Shovel". His and the
soda pop case were both pending before Judge Manning. Commissioner Bolden's
defense attorney, James Montgomery, was reportedly a close crony of Judge
Manning. It was obvious to savvy sorts what might happen.
Montgomery reportedly had ties of some sort over
the years with Nevada gambling casino gangsters. Reportedly part of the
crime cartel and a big-time owner of gambling casinos, William F. Cellini
reportedly had bought the federal judgeship for Manning, paying some one
million dollars through then U.S. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun [D., Ill.].
John DeCamp, in a position reportedly to understand a few things about
Coca-Cola and the CIA and the Chicago federal judges, withdrew from the
newly started case against Coke, in July, 1997. A few weeks later, started
the federal criminal trial USA vs. John Bolden. Same Judge.
Anyone knowing a lot about court knows that even trials by jury can be
"fixed" or sabotaged by the trial Judge. Such as, by the Judge keeping out
key evidence as being "inadmissible", by manipulating the dates and
circumstances of the jury procedures. By slanting the court procedures
against the prosecutors and in favor of the criminal defendant. By
scheduling the jury under peculiar circumstances.
In September, 1997, the jury in the Bolden case
came back with a split verdict. Guilty on tax evasion, wherein Bolden could
get, at most, six months in prison. They acquitted Bolden on the more
serious charges of extortion.
John Bolden was a bigshot making as much as 90 thousand dollars a year as
Commissioner of Water for City of Chicago. [And perhaps much more as
pay-offs to influence his official position.]
He was a big fish. The team that helped put
together the charges against Bolden were and are livid. Why? They contend
that Judge Manning, to go easy on Water Commissioner Bolden, got a financial
benefit that some might construe as a bribe.
The team, in plain language, grumbles loud
enough for others to hear, that U.S. District Judge Blanche M. Manning is a
crook, whose chair reportedly was bought for her by a crook, and that she
belongs in prison, along with the one who bought her the Judgeship.
To understand this story fully, you have to understand the realities of
political and financial power. Those who put together criminal charges are
most often NOT concerned about bribes to Judges in CIVIL cases. So, if Judge
Manning had been bribed or corruptly influenced or blackmailed in the CIVIL
case, the one against Coca-Cola, well, the team is NOT concerned.
In the Water Commissioner's case, Judge Manning
made the same mistake, however, as Chicago Federal Appeals Judge Otto Kerner,
Jr., in 1969. He had reportedly taken a huge bribe in a CIVIL case,
involving a five million dollar claim regarding a pet food company. The
matter, however, that instigated the federal criminal charges against Judge Kerner was that he had been corrupted to turn loose the Silver-Hi-Jacking
Gang, an important federal CRIMINAL case.
A federal judge is a fool to counter the prosecutors in a federal criminal
case. A federal judge who takes bribes or financial benefits or is corruptly
influenced or blackmailed, in a CIVIL case, most likely stays peacefully and
quietly on the bench until he or she retires or croaks.
The other some two dozen U.S. District Judges that sit with Judge Manning in
the federal courthouse in Chicago are just as corrupt as Manning. EXCEPT,
they do not screw or sabotage or sabotage CRIMINAL cases. [This is not a
blanket generality. I could detail their crimes as well, one by one.]
Judge Kerner learned the hard way the number one unwritten law that applies
to crooked judges:
YOU DO NOT SCREW AROUND WITH CRIMINAL CASES,
only civil cases.
Our group, by the way, was instrumental in
getting Kerner put in prison.
He was the highest ranking sitting federal judge
to be sent to jail for bribery in U.S. history. Also sent to jail with him,
by our work, was his crony, the former Director of the Illinois Department
of Revenue, the highest Illinois state tax collector, Theodore J. Isaacs.
When I publicly accused Kerner, he tried to get a fellow judge to jail me
for contempt of court. Kerner held a press conference and all the local
media carried his statement calling me a "liar". But get this, he died an
ex-convict. So who was lying after all?
Here are a few questions to think about:
-
Were and are Coca-Cola's hotshot Chicago
lawyers in a position to know that Judge Manning may be in big
trouble and subject to blackmail, such as reportedly by Coke's
lawyers, because of her role in the Water Commissioner's case.
Coca-Cola's attorneys are: Ms Laura Beth Miller, of Brinks, Hofer,
Gilson & Lione [(312) 321-4715], E-mail: lmiller@brinkshofer.com
FAX:(312) 321-4299
-
Why is nothing done about Simon
Marketing, a marketing adjunct of Coca-Cola and also defendant with
them? The one in court that purports to represent Simon Marketing,
reportedly actually represents the insurance carrier. Are they
committing a fraud upon the court? Simon Marketing merged with Cyrk,
Inc., not shown in the Court record. Purporting to represent Simon
Marketing is: Jacqueline A. Criswell (312) 627-4000 E-Mail:
jcriswell@mail.tsmp.com FAX: (312) 627-1717, of Tressler, Soderstrom,
Maloney & Priess
-
Why did Judge Manning have six federal
police in her courtroom, to intimidate me, when I testified at a
hearing as to my investigations in respect to Judge Manning and the
Coca-Cola case?
-
The other judges in the federal
courthouse with Judge Manning know better than to sabotage or
corruptly screw up the prosecutors in a federal criminal case. How
is it that she does not realize she on the road to possible
disaster? Did she flunk out of Crooked Judge 101? The other crooked
judges in her courthouse have all passed the test. They are each as
corrupt as her but know how to survive as a corrupt judge.
Cynics claim that the School for training
Corrupt Judges how to survive, is financed, in part, by gambling casino
loot. Wise bookies are refusing bets, however, on Judge Manning, a judicial
school drop-out.
Do we know who actually runs such a school? You
betcha.
Part 7
A real-life drama and the players
September 22, 2000
ROBERT E. KOLODY - For upwards of ten years
a local lawyer he trusted, DANIEL V. HANLEY, reportedly elicited from
Kolody details of his legal strategy plans. Kolody contends that The
Coca-Cola Company and their marketing adjunct, Simon Marketing, stole
Kolody's intellectual property, being storyboards and designs. Kolody
had difficulty getting a Chicago-area attorney to pursue his claims.
Since 1997, Kolody's case has been in the U.S. District Court in
Chicago, No. 97 C 190.
In February, 1999, Kolody retained Dan Ivy, an outspoken attorney from
Arkansas. As required under the local federal rules in Chicago, Ivy
designated Hanley as "local counsel", meaning Hanley has to be informed
of all proposed court filings and procedures.
SHERMAN H. SKOLNICK - As a long-time court reformer and TV Show
moderator/producer I began investigating the Coca-Cola case. In May,
2000, in the presence of Ivy and Kolody, I interview Hanley:
Skolnick "Does Coca-Cola and their attorneys know the legal strategy of
Robert Kolody and his attorney Dan Ivy here?"
Daniel V. Hanley "Yes."
Skolnick "Really? How could they know?"
Hanley "My sister is MEDIA BUYER FOR COCA-COLA."
From the signed court Declaration by
Skolnick and Skolnick's court testimony made in the presence of Daniel
V. Hanley, 8/22/00.
After the May interview, I find out that his
sister, Mary Hanley, is Associate Media Director at the advertising agency
DDB, with offices worldwide.
And get this DDB represents both Coca-Cola and
their alleged "competitor" Pepsi-Cola, an apparent Anti-Trust violation
situation.
TRIBUNE COMPANY - As the parent firm of the
Tribune media empire, the Tribune Company owns the CHICAGO TRIBUNE, THE
LOS ANGELES TIMES, and other newspapers around the country as well as
numerous radio and TV stations. Tribune Company is reportedly trying to
strong-arm COCA-COLA for more advertising dollars, by reportedly leaning
on DDB. But Tribune has not been interested in publicizing the Kolody
suit against Coca-Cola.
U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE BLANCHE M. MANNING, Chicago - The Tribune, without
publicity in their newspapers, radio, and TV, has sought to intervene in
one of Judge Manning's criminal cases to accuse her of secret
proceedings and other unlawful acts and doings. [See previous parts of
this series.] The apparent purpose? To blackmail the Judge and put
pressure on Coca-Cola and DDB for more ad bucks, to relieve the
Tribune's huge debt overhang caused by merging with the Los Angeles
Times.
In a series of court-filed Motions by Kolody, he documents how Judge
Manning has been stuffing the Court records with "judicial perjuries",
straight out lies used to justify arbitrary and corrupt rulings favoring
Coca-Cola.
GEORGE LAZARUS - As the Chicago Tribune's long-time, widely-read
columnist on marketing and advertising, Lazarus on 8/15/00, runs an item
"Mary Hanley, a group media director of DDB Chicago, was elected a
senior VP of the agency" and includes a picture of her.
MARY HANLEY - Selected to be a top official of DDB Advertising, she is
reportedly unavailable to be a witness at an important hearing in
Kolody's case set for 8/22/00. Her brother, DANIEL V. HANLEY tells
Kolody and Skolnick, in a conference call, that Mary Hanley is leaving
the country for Ireland. Later, Hanley tells them she will be back in 15
days. [Is there a link to the IRA? See previous parts of this series.]
While Kolody is listening on the phone, Skolnick interviews JILL
ZEMANSKI, private secretary of Mary Hanley. Jill confirms that Mary
Hanley represents COCA-COLA COMPANY.
THE HEARING ON AUGUST 22, 2000- Informed by attorney Ivy that there are
in Court present two witnesses, Skolnick and Kolody, prepared to testify
that Judge Manning is committing a fraud upon her own Court in the
Coca-Cola case, Judge Manning brings into the courtroom SIX FEDERAL
POLICE to menace and intimidate Skolnick sitting in his wheelchair.
The purpose of the hearing?
For Judge Manning to hear and consider whether
she herself has committed a fraud upon her own Court through the Judge
falsifying the facts and filling the Court records with her "judicial
perjuries". The Judge does NOT seem to understand that such a hearing with
her presiding, is outlawed by Anglo-Saxon law, that is, for a person TO SIT
AS A JUDGE IN THEIR OWN CASE.
Ivy tells the Judge that the remedy he and his client Kolody seek is for the
Judge to expunge from the Court records all of Judge Manning's rulings
favoring The Coca-Cola Company and Simon Marketing. Judge Manning said she
will take the matter of her own fraud upon the Court and instances brought
up of newly discovered evidence, "under advisement". [The foregoing is shown
in the Report of Proceedings of her Court, of 8/22/00.]
Following the hearing, the Broadsides Cable TV Program sends an envoy to
Tribune columnist GEORGE LAZARUS informing him what is happening in Court as
to The Coca-Cola Company, Mary Hanley, and DDB advertising. He expresses an
interest that he is going to follow up the matter for his column. [Or, are
his bosses at the Tribune intending to over-rule him and pursue their
reported blackmailing of DDB, Judge Manning, Coca-Cola, and others, to
shake-down more ad bucks for The Tribune Company?]
In a Court order dated 8/29/00, Judge Manning issues a nine-page ruling with
more of her falsified facts and "judicial perjuries", contending she finds
that she has NOT committed a fraud upon her own Court. [An obvious ruling by
someone sitting as a Judge in their own case.] As to some of the prior
rulings, Ivy files a Notice of Appeal on August 31,2000.
Among the issues involved in the case against Coca-Cola That the Coca-Cola
Company allowed their copyright to lapse and it is now owned by Kolody as
shown by documents of the U.S. Copyright office. That Coca-Cola has in
respect to this litigation committed a fraud by not reporting it to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission that regulates listed stock such as that
of Coke.
Several weeks in the works was a story published in the much-watched Tempo
Section of the Chicago Tribune, usually published on a Thursday. Published
on Thursday, September 7, 2000, was a lengthy Tempo story about various
other soda pop companies.
In quoting a seller of a flavored foreign pop
called Tarhun,
"People believe Tarhun is good for you and
Coke is bad for you".
Then further quoting the seller,
"For instance, have you ever seen what
happens when you put a chicken liver in a glass of Coke?"
In so doing, the Tribune was taking a swipe at
Coke to reportedly shake them and DDB down for more ad bucks.
While they were commenting, the Tribune could have added that Coca-Cola can
be a substitute for DRANO to clear out your home plumbing.
The very next day, Friday, September 8, 2000, player GEORGE LAZARUS was
found dead on the commuter train he took each day to the Tribune offices. In
a lengthy story Saturday, September 9, 2000, a sort of obituary, headlined
"Veteran Business Columnist George Lazarus Dies", the Tribune stated,
"His daily column, put together through an
indomitable force of will for 39 years, all but 11 of them at the
Tribune, was practically Holy Writ for executives in the marketing and
advertising business in Chicago".
Then the Tribune adds this strange sort of
cynical humor,
"WE WERE SURE HE WAS HIDING IN OUR
RESTROOMS", said DDB WORLDWIDE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER KEITH REINHARD.
"MANY TIMES, WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW HE GOT THE STORY."
Did someone plant that item in that obituary to
take the glare of possible foul play off of themselves and DDB and the
Tribune and all the matters discussed in this series?
The Tribune story stated,
"A Metra [commuter train] employee found him
Friday morning, slumped in his seat on his way to work, his customary
collection of morning newspapers still in his lap. He had died on his
morning commute from his Flossmoor home to his office downtown."
Some of his buddies, however, have confided to
us that they are convinced that GEORGE LAZARUS was murdered.
One media honcho, poorly informed and naive,
said "Was he shot with a gun?" a foolish question in the current era of
political assassination. [Evidently, they never read the reports by CIA to
Congressional intelligence committees about cyanide pistols and potassium
killer devices.]
Did the Tribune want their own reporter DEAD? There is the unsolved crime of
about 1930, involving a Tribune reporter, Jake Lingle, who was
shaking down mobsters and others to hush up stories. He was bumped off by
being shot in a public place. [It may be a small item but Lazarus lived
among the numerous hoodlums in the south suburb of Flossmoor.]
So you thought that mass media reporters are only knocked off in Mexico? Ha,
ha. Lazarus was reportedly pursuing some of the issues raised by our series
Was the highly corrupt U.S. Justice Department going to finally take an
interest that Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola are owned and operated by
substantially the same people?
That they are a price-fixing monopoly designed
to wreck other smaller soft drink beverage firms like R C Cola. And that DDB
advertising represents both of the two major soda pop companies, Coca-Cola
and Pepsi-Cola.
So how many more are they going to have to assassinate to cover up the
Coca-Cola espionage and corruption scandals?
Part 8
THE SO-CALLED EMBEZZLEMENT OF McDONALD'S
HAMBURGERS
August 23, 2001
McDonald's Hamburgers, a worldwide chain as a
purveyor of Coca-Cola, is caught up supposedly in an embezzlement racket.
The Bush Justice Department has focused on an
employee of McDonald's long-time marketing adjunct, Simon Marketing, their
Chief of Security. The FBI says it involves rigging and siphoning off a
purported 13 million dollars from McDonald's prize contests.
Sources in narcotics law enforcement and the field of Federal criminal
prosecution contend, however, the true nature of the scandal is being
covered up by the George W. Bush Justice Department. Sneering at and hooting
at the Bush Justice Department, they tell confidants that they call the U.S.
Attorney General "John Ashcan", to signify a continuation, they say, of
cover-up artist Janet "Butch" Reno.
Those ahead of the curve say that patriotic Americans must leave their
cocoon of denial. Howsoever it has happened, the biggest business in the
United States is the distribution of dope principally from Southwest China
and Colombia. It exceeds any business you can mention. IBM and General
Motors, by comparison, are children's' lemonade stands.
A full understanding of the profound and complex details would convince any
reasonable person that what appears to be only the crimes of
misappropriation of game prize monies are really an epidemic of corruption
that reaches up to America's highest tribunal, the U.S. Supreme Court.
Some background.
The matter revolves, in part, around a
Massachusetts-based games promotion firm, Cyrk, Inc., and through a
complicated series of mergers and moves, to Simon Worldwide, Inc., and
division, Simon Marketing. The founder of Cyrk, a Balkans-linked marine
biology professor whose hobby was graphic design, picked a Slavic word for
the name of the firm, meaning CIRCUS. Has it become a misleading if not evil
three rings of criminality?
The business formed a partnership with Asian trading company, Li & Fung
which acquired a one-third interest in the company. This deal gave Cyrk
access to the trading company's manufacturing arrangements in Asia. The
nature of the business had reputed links that were part of the British opium
dynasty, that sought to subjugate China starting in the 19th Century.
Among the reputed links to Simon Marketing are
the Hong Kong & Shanghai Bank which financed the opium trade starting more
than 150 years ago. In recent years, in a taped interview, the manager of
what was the bank's unit in Chicago clearly admitted the same to us.
The bank's parent, Hong Kong & Shanghai Bank
Corp., HSBC, was in the process of merging in 1999, with the reputed
international criminal banking center, tied to the Russian mafia and
Colombia/U.S. dope cartel, Republic National Bank of New York, headed by
international gold smuggling tycoon Edmond Safra.
In the midst of the merger dealings, Safra was
apparently murdered in his lavish villa in the smugglers' haven of Monaco.
The crime against the ailing Safra was blamed, some claim falsely, on one of
Safra's male nurses. [See "Murder
In the Gold Market"].
The dope smuggling business from the Orient, starting at least in the 19th
Century and continuing to this date, reportedly was and is overseen by the
Inchcape Family, long-time operators in the Pacific basin and elsewhere of
ship-lines, banks, and other financial and transportation entities, from the
Orient to America.
[For an extensive historical and current round-up of this Family's reputed
criminality, with references to little-known publications and government
reports, see "Dope, Inc."]
In 1997, Cyrk consummated a licensing agreement with Ty Inc., the maker of
Beanie Babies. It was part of McDonald's Hamburgers marketing and
advertising agenda directed at enticing young children into their fast food
chain stores.
Described in some press reports as secretive,
Oak Brook, Illinois-based Ty Inc., is presumed to be run by its purported
sole owner Ty Warner who as president and founder of Ty Inc. is an investor
in Simon Worldwide, Inc.
[Oak Brook is in Du Page County adjoining Cook
County and Chicago. Law enforcement personnel confirm that Oak Brook is the
new center for the Old West Side Chicago Mob. Frank Sinatra and a host of
known criminal-types were the original stockholders reportedly of Oak Brook
Development Company. Cynics crow it is a natural place, under the
circumstances, for McDonald's and Ty Inc.]
With Cyrk, and Simon, and McDonald's and McDonald's advertising agency DDB
Chicago, was set off a clever latter day version of the Dutch tulip craze.
[See the book, "Extraordinary Popular Delusions & The Madness of Crowds" by
Charles MacKay et al., paperback reprint of historical book, 1995.]
For reasons that defied intellectual logic, the Beanies Babies became an
industry, with the buying and selling of them causing, for a while,
astronomical prices. Particularly after Ty Inc. in a highly secretive move,
shut down their website and then announced they were retiring every one of
its Beanies Babies, the plush collectibles. That was December, 1999.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Customs were
reportedly aware but took no enforcement action as to what some contend is
the real nature of the pellet-contained bean bags, a major export item from
Red China to the U.S.
The Red Chinese had apparently developed a
process to pelletize dope. And then later, how to undo the process as to
result in the successful marketing of narcotics. Through bar-codes on the
boxes the bean bags were shipped in, it was possible that agents of the drug
cartel could sort out those that were harmless from those containing
pelletized dope that could NOT be detected by dope-sniffing dogs.
[For more of a background on this, visit our extensive website series, "RED
CHINESE SECRET POLICE IN THE UNITED STATES".]
Former DEA officials and others presently or formerly in dope law
enforcement assert they would have liked to have the arrangements, through
the U.S. Justice Department, to question before federal grand juries, all
those involved with McDonald's in the importing of the bean bags.
Of course, under the American Constitutional
principles, Ty Inc., McDonald's Hamburgers, Cyrk, Inc., Simon Worldwide,
Inc., and Simon Marketing are presumed innocent until proven otherwise. And
it should be expected for them to vigorously deny knowledge of dope
criminality.
The FBI, the Justice Department, and the oil-soaked, spy-riddled monopoly
press did not bother to explain that in arresting the Chief of Security of
Simon for misappropriating game prize monies, that this was not some lowly
guard-shack employee. In a business like Simon, the Chief of Security is not
a low-level person but a top-drawer official.
That official was reportedly from Wackenhut, a
huge adjunct to the American CIA. [See "Spy Magazine", 9/92, as to Wackenhut
having far more people than CIA. This so-called private proprietary of the
spy agency is to evade Freedom of Information requests.]
Another business caught up ostensibly in the bigger scandal of which the
game prizes are a tiny part, is Yucaipa Companies. Yucaipa owns 70 per cent
of Golden State foods, one of McDonald's Hamburgers largest food suppliers.
Yucaipa also is an investor in Simon Worldwide, Inc.
An interesting sidelight is how Rev. Jesse Jackson apparently pressured
Yucaipa to reward Jesse's mistress, Karin Stanford, by paying her as a
purported "consultant", ten thousand dollars per month. [See, Chicago
Sun-Times, 1/26/2001.]
Some of the illicit dealings of Simon Marketing have come out in a suit
where they and Coca-Cola are named defendants. The suit, pending in
Chicago's federal courts also involved a fraud upon the court by Judge
Blanche Manning hearing the case. The attorneys for Simon Marketing's
liability carrier, referring to themselves as "attorneys for Simon
Marketing", had originally stated in Court in the lawsuit, that they did not
know of Cyrk. Later, the same lawyers, exposing their false prior
statements, said they DID know of Cyrk.
[To understand more about McDonald's, Coca-Cola, and DDB Chicago their
advertising agency, visit the prior parts of this series.]
It should be obvious from the details of those that have overseen McDonald's
Hamburgers and Coca-Cola's advertising and marketing agenda, that such
entities and their top officials most likely were in a position to be aware
of the criminal mess confronting McDonald's marketing adjunct, Simon
Marketing.
In further parts of this series will be detailed how the McDonald's
"embezzlement" scandal is really the dope rackets of the U.S./Colombia dope
cartel. See "The
Chandra Levy Affair, Part Two" as to dope king Carlos Lehder and
his business partners the Bush Family.
When the details are all laid out, it would be
obvious the scandal reaches all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Part 9
Fraud Upon The Chicago Federal
Appeals Court And The US Supreme Court
September 22, 2003
There is one subject lawyers do not generally
study at all.
That is, Fraud Upon the Court, implicating the
Judges themselves. After all, lawyers are Officers of the Court, pledged and
sworn to uphold and respect the Courts. Corruption and bribery, involving
the Judge themselves, are a rarity; and lawyers do not wish to get caught up
in it.
The biggest judicial bribery scandal in American history was caused by me as
a non-lawyer, self-educated in Law. In 1969, in a little-known or understood
procedure, I invoked the same directly confronting most of the Judges on
Illinois' highest state tribunal. Instead of denying the accusations, the
Illinois Supreme Court ordered a local Judge in Chicago to grill me as to
how our group, of which I am the Founder and Chairman, since 1963, goes
about investigating court corruption.
That is, the Citizen's Committee to Clean Up the
Courts.
If I did not detail our methods, I was informed, I would be sent to prison
for a judge-invented offense, created out of the mists and vapors of
antiquity, called contempt of court. It was an extreme burden and jeopardy
thrown upon me.
As most of the judges and lawyers knew, and anybody could see, I was a
paraplegic in a wheelchair, from infantile paralysis, called polio, since
childhood. I get about haltingly if at all, on crutches and heavy metal
braces. I use a wheelchair. When I refused to divulge our investigative
methods, they ordered me to prison. The Sheriff's Police had a problem.
They did not know how to put a wheelchair-bound
person into the heavily-armored vehicle, called a paddy wagon. They were set
to take me away, to demean and humiliate me, as if they had caught the
biggest bank-robber in American history.
The only thing about banks was that the state high court judges had been
fingered by me for having been bribed to turn loose the head and major
stockholder of a bank across the street from their Chicago office. The
banker was in their court on criminal conviction. He had been the top state
tax collector, Director of the Illinois Department of Revenue.
Founded by him, the bank called Civic Center
Bank was named for the courthouse across the street. The bribery involved
the State high court Judges, along with nine name-brand gangsters, brought
into the Civic Center bank as owners, as a pay-off.
Unfortunately, this secret has been typical of American justice,
Banker-Judges, throughout the land and history. And I knew all about it.
The picture of the police and their difficulty in hauling me away to jail
ended up in August, 1969, in Time Magazine. The uproar caused the state high
court to be swept away into near-oblivion. More than thirty two years later,
was published a book by a Law Professor, carefully detailing what had
happened. ("Illinois Justice" by Kenneth A. Manaster, 2001.)
Shortly after the state high court mess, the highest ranking sitting federal
Judge in the nation's history, formerly Illinois Governor, a paid-off owner
of the Civic Center Bank; he was then sitting on the Chicago federal appeals
court; he together with the State top Tax Collector, were both sent to
prison for bribery as a result of our work.
To this day, many federal judges together with
the bosses of the State Revenue and top brass of the U.S. IRS deeply hate
our guts for having caused this. [Scroll
down our website for our series on IRS top-level corruption,
including a boat the tax collector bosses use as an ocean-going
money-laundry, called "California Rose".]
Most all the judges ever sent to jail for bribery and related offenses, in
the nation's history, were clapped away in the last forty years, as a
consequence of our work. And in the whole history of the courts in this
country, there is only one other publicized instance of investigation of
Fraud Upon the Court implicating the Judges themselves. It was a fraud by
the Judges themselves, upon the U.S. Court of Appeals in the 3rd Circuit, in
1948.
I have been a key witness in the court corruption and related media
corruption involving the Chicago case against Coca-Cola Company by a
advertising storyboard creator, former owner of a video/advertising
production company, Robert E. Kolody.
As to the court corruption, I have been a
witness in the Kolody case against Coca-Cola which started in Chicago's U.S.
District Court.
Our group's research and investigations aided in the Motion to Investigate
Fraud Upon the U.S. Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit Perpetrated by the Judges
Themselves of Said Court, and the companion, overlapping matter of Fraud
Upon the U.S. Supreme Court.
The matter has been filed, September 22, 2003,
by being sent to the Clerk of U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, by
Registered Mail, Return Receipt Requested, and is thus, under the rules,
considered as filed on September 22, 2003. The prefacing court-required
Notice of Motion, the Declaration, and the Service List, together with the
Motion itself, are included below.

Secret Tribunal Grabs High Court Fraud Mess
October 4, 2003
Click here to download Document
Some have come to know about the Patriot Act and
Homeland Security.
That seems to authorize secret proceedings.
Seldom mentioned, however, is that some years ago has been set up in the
U.S., a series of nationwide secret tribunals. In and out of the law trade,
few know or understand the workings.
Few, if any, are skilled in tangling
with this already set up apparat.
Notice the particulars:
-
They are housed in supposed federal
facilities or federal office buildings.
-
Their headquarters are not in a known
room or group of rooms. They have, if at all, only a general
address.
-
They have no records available to the
public, referencing what is pending there, what determinations are
made and have been made there, and who all are effected by the
clandestine operations.
-
There are no records available to the
public adequately showing who all sit there, and when, and under
what circumstances.
-
Witnesses supposedly "voluntary" or
actually abducted and brought there, with or without a so-called
"legal" subpoena or warrant, are grilled by methods used by Royal
tyrants centuries ago.
-
What do this series of secret tribunals
supposedly do? They purport to investigate instances of bribery of
federal judges and related corruption. It appears to be a giant
whitewash machine, in the dark hole of limbo.
In Chicago, for example, they are the Judicial
Council of the Seventh Circuit, involving the federal courts of Illinois,
Indiana, and Wisconsin.
Each Judge on the U.S. Supreme Court actually
wears two hats. First, they are, of course, a Justice on the high court.
Secondly, they are the supervising Circuit Justice of one or more of the
federal court circuits. They are more or less the "orchestra leader" of the
secret tribunals, apparently operating outside the regular court system,
known as Judicial Council of [such and such] Circuit.
I have been a court reformer more than forty six years.
For more than forty years, I have been the
Founder/Chairman of a court-reform group, Citizen's Committee to Clean Up
the Courts. Among other things, through volunteer associates and
investigators worldwide, we compile data on financial and espionage matters.
Why? Because we are about the only ones who use the label Banker-Judge to
describe important judges who are interwoven with the financial system and
Aristocracy, and some, who are entangled with the Espionage Cartel, the
American CIA, and other spook agencies.
For example, our investigations of banker-judges touched off, in 1969, the
biggest judicial bribery scandal in U.S. history.
It caused the highest state court of Illinois,
that is, the Illinois Supreme Court, to be toppled almost into oblivion. By
2001, a law professor wrote a book all about it, "Illinois Justice" by
Kenneth A. Manaster.
One of about the only judges having a kind word
publicly about me, after all me being a judge-buster, is shown in a picture
on the cover of the book talking to me. That is, John Paul Stevens, who
since 1969, became a Judge on the U.S. Supreme Court. He wrote the forward
to the book mentioning me.
Because of the four decades of the work of our group, I have to, from time
to time, set forth my credentials, to make matters clear to others. I try
very hard to remain humble and not brag There have been only about two
persons with working knowledge of the Judicial Councils. One was a very rare
honest Chief Judge of a U.S. District Court.
He dared make proper rulings,
based on evidence and witnesses on trial in his Court, lambasting Big Oil.
A Judicial Council in his Circuit, on behalf of
the petroleum monopoly, took away his entire docket of cases, destroyed him,
and stole everything from his office. And the 24-hour security patrol would
not thereafter talk to him, to explain how his office and all its records
could thus be carted away. [Details are in the recently published book,
"Ahead of the Parade" by Sherman H. Skolnick.]
I seem to be the only other one who understands something about this secret
Gestapo, the Judicial Council. They operate beyond the Bill of Rights. [Do
we all understand that the Bill of Rights was reluctantly against great
resistance added to the basic U.S. Constitution, to shield Americans from
tyranny by a central government?]
Some years ago I confronted the dictators operating as the Judicial Council
of the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, Illinois. My detailed court papers,
setting forth their crimes, completely disappeared from the U.S. Supreme
Court. [Sherman H. Skolnick, petitioner versus Judicial Council of the
Seventh Circuit, respondents.]
Our group did much of the investigations and research that on September 22,
2003, was filed as Motion to Investigate Fraud Upon the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Perpetrated by the Judges Themselves. As
shown in the detailed document, among other things, I was a key sworn
witness in the matter. I obtained the confession of a local attorney who was
apparently a spy in the camp of the one who sued Coca-Cola.
He admitted his sister was "media buyer for
Coca-Cola".
Among the details was the matter of cocaine, a
by-product of the massive processing in the U.S. of coca leaves for the
secret base of Coca-Cola. Some of the cocaine in the U.S. actually is NOT
smuggled in but is created within the U.S. There is "leakage" into non-legal
channels of cocaine and implicated in the same has been George Herbert
Walker Bush, a director of a pharmaceutical firm, and a federal appeals
judge, later chief Judge, installed on the bench by Bush in Chicago.
There has been a Coca-Cola connection to bribery of judges and espionage, as
stated in the court papers.
For example, this was the route for corrupting
at least two U.S. Supreme Court Judges of the 5-Judge majority that
arbitrarily installed George W. Bush as the occupant and resident of the
White House. Some call it the infamous Bush versus Gore litigation.
Attached hereto is a copy of the fraud upon the court matter, implicating
Judges on the U.S. Supreme Court. in Chicago, the corruption involved ALL
the Judges of the federal appeals court, sitting in what they call "en
banc".
Cynics say it should be called, all the Judges
sitting in the Coca-Cola/U.S. Supreme Court Bank.
So now there is a one page document and the envelope it arrived in, showing
the secret tribunal has plundered and swallowed up, the whole high
court/federal appeals court bribery mess. What is the secret tribunal matter
name or number? Where is the docket reference? Who all sits there?
The attached copy is cryptic.
For convenience, it is reduced in size and the
envelope is shown as well.
Part 11
Pepsi-Cola is Really Coca-Cola?
January 6, 2004
From ancient times onward, there have always been certain ways of getting
things done.
By way of defeating your enemy, you send spies
to infiltrate your enemy's camp. Or, as an alternative, to control what you
perceive as the know-nothings, you set up a false "enemy". AND, claiming the
"enemy" is formidable and threatening the nation, what do you do?
Before we continue on this topic, we first must define and identify terms.
By YOU, I mean
the Establishment, "the powers that be", the Aristocracy, the
Ruling Class. And, of course, to do your sneaky, treacherous dirty work, you
have your stooges, to be later scape-goated when necessary, to protect and
perpetuate your power and your position.
So, by way of supposedly "protecting" the great unwashed, the shirtless
ones, against a created "enemy", you put huge on-going obligations on the
backs of the populace.
You clip the corners of your gold coins, you
cheapen your paper money, and raise huge armies and cause your war-mongering
industries to invent and produce the latest weaponry at several times the
price of civilian-type devices.
Further, you lure volunteers into being your warriors, promising later
benefits (eventually reneged on) to those hungry for employment. As a last
resort, you require all those reaching military age to register with
agencies of the central authority.
This, so you can, as needed, set up boards of
compulsion, conscripting those who are too proud to run away from their
"patriotic duty" to be maimed or slaughtered on some faraway battlefield
that many young people cannot find on the map. That is, their "duty" to
protect the elite, the plutocrats, and their assets, or crudely described as
protecting their asses.
And this, against a background of drum-rolls of guarantees, that the rich
and the poor alike, have the equal right to sleep under bridges when it
rains.
Is it any wonder, then, that large financial interests, likewise, have
certain ways of extending and consolidating their power and control?
Early in their history, the Rockefeller monopoly rid themselves of their
obsolete facilities. How? By claiming their competitors, their supposed
"enemy", bombed the Rockefeller plant. Left unsaid, except by a pitiful few
anti-cartel crusaders, was that the Rockefellers created and controlled this
false enemy to fool those who relied too heavily on the popular press, owned
as well by
the Rockefellers.
By the way, to give the image of "law", the
Rockefellers bought the Pennsylvania State Legislature, owning all the
representatives.
Sound familiar?
And for centuries, this sort of way of controlling and creating events, has
been played out against a vast panorama of idle jargon and slogans.
"We are,
after all, a nation, not of men, but of LAWS."
By repeated propaganda, a mindset is put into the mental software of the
common-folk.
Namely, that the men and women who adjudicate our rights,
privileges, and immunities, together with our claims, on occasion, against
the entrenched, large corporate interests - that those who pass judgment on
us peons, are all, most certainly, deities. For, take note of the scene.
They sit, after all, in their black and austere
robes in a high-ceilinged royal chamber, on a throne.
In their opinion, if we dare insult their divine-like authority; then, from
the mists and vapors of antiquity, they draw out their battle-axes and
chains, and have us thus hauled away to prison, for "contempt of court".
[As the writer of this story I know directly. In
some eight times in forty six years as a court reformer, wheelchair and all,
I have been hauled away to prison, not for crimes, but for "contempt of
court", for directly accusing the judges of specific bribery and corruption.
In each case, I was later vindicated, and the judges I accused were removed
from the bench or sent to prison for bribery. Many of them later died as
ex-convicts.]
Appeals, if any, go up through a church-like hierarchy, the head tribunal of
which has a demeaning set of their own rules. The common Americans have no
right to enter the U.S. Supreme Court seeking remedies. A petitioner has to
file a "begging" petition, "praying" to be allowed to enter this holy of
holies. This type of plea on bended-knee, is called by the ancient term of
Petition for Certiorari.
In October of a recent year, at the opening of the high court term, sixteen
hundred of these "prayers" to be allowed to even knock on their door, were
pending. (Many lawyers continue to use, as is their tradition, the clerical
terminology.)
Each and every one of these "prayers" to enter
were later marked as rejected, with a single word, "denied", customarily
sent by collect telegram, no reasons given by the nine high and mighty
priests of America's highest church-court. Each such petition, to be
acceptable to be read at all by the high court law clerks and courtiers, has
to conclude with a "prayer for relief", required by the rules.
All sixteen
hundred "prayers for relief" had no merit? Really?
Hey, what's this, about Church and State? Why do critics of the high
tribunal call it America's nursing home?
So, if you actually comprehend this background, then you might understand
the strange and sinister court activities of two giants of the beverage
industry, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola.
-
Knowledgeable sources contend that Coke
is really Pepsi and vice versa. BUT, it is not simple to quickly
prove this right away to those who may be naive and poorly informed.
-
Savvy folks who should know better,
nevertheless assert that Coke and Pepsi are competitors. Yet they
seem to jointly control the beverage industry and pricing, running
the prices up and down, to ruin lesser enterprises.
-
Because of the secret combination
between Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola, lesser beverage companies are
locked out of profitable markets, such as at beverage counters at
movie theaters; such as at vending machines at gas stations and at
public and private schools and colleges; such as at shelf space and
prominent displays at food store chains; all in violation of
Anti-Trust laws and similar provisions outlawing price, market, and
distribution favoritism and dirty business with the same.
-
Coca-Cola funds have been used to
corrupt judges on the U.S. Supreme Court in the litigation of Bush
versus Gore, where a 5-judge, Military-Style Junta on the high court
installed George W. Bush as the occupant and resident of the White
House. [See "Coca-Cola, the CIA, and the Courts"
Part 9.]
-
There is substantial reason to believe
Coca-Cola is responsible for the murder and mayhem directed against
labor activists and dissidents in Colombia. See
http //www.cokewatch.org/ and
Pittsburgh, Pa., "Post-Gazette" newspaper, April 29, 2003.
-
See the details regarding Richard M.
Nixon, Pepsi-Cola, and the murder of President Kennedy in our
website story "The Overthrow of the American Republic", part 42,
sub-titled "The Public Execution of John F. Kennedy".
-
Knowledgeable sources contend the
facilities of Pepsi-Cola/Coca-Cola overseas are used to secretly
process dope, which may be the basis for authorities there to have
conducted seizure and ransacking of Coke facilities in Spain,
Belgium, Italy, and elsewhere in Europe. See earlier parts of this
series.
-
One giant of advertising and marketing,
with a huge unit in the Windy City, DDB Chicago, has ostensibly
directly and/or through their parent firm, represented both
Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, an apparent violation of Anti-Trust Laws.
-
So, it should come as no surprise that
in certain areas in the U.S., Coca-Cola/Pepsi-Cola work a malign if
not corrupt influence on federal judges in cases involving the
beverage monopolists. What is certain as we have many times pointed
out in our articles, the cheapest federal judge whores in the U.S.,
are those in the federal courts in Chicago.
(Observers of court
corruption in New York and Los Angeles, however, loudly object to
our seemingly fingering only Chicago's federal courts.)
And the two
beverage giants prefer to be in a courthouse located a few miles
from the old West Side, once site of Chicago's traditional mafia.
-
Coca-Cola is embroiled in a highly
corrupt case in the federal courts in Chicago. In another case, in
the same courthouse, Pepsi-Cola is apparently likewise entangled in
a crooked case.
The details are in the court records of each case.
The Coke case has already been referred to in earlier parts of this
website series. For example, in the case Robert E. Kolody versus
Simon Marketing and Coca-Cola Company, the Chicago U.S. District
Judge has been Judge Blanche M. Manning.
In the court record, and not disputed,
is that a known gangster-type paid at least a million dollars to buy
her the judgeship.
(An
elite government unit, stating they are investigating our
undisputed charges in the court records, informed us that we were
"not accurate". That in investigating the matter, they confirmed -
hey, get this! - that the gangster paid TWO MILLION DOLLARS for the
judgeship not one million. Was anyone grabbed and prosecuted for
this criminality? Not so far.)
A great secret is that state and federal
judgeships are bought and sold. - current price for a Federal
District Court judgeship is two million dollars, for a judgeship on
the U.S. Courts of Appeal in the various circuits around the U.S.,
the price is "sky is the limit", ten million dollars MINIMUM.
Am I hearing some poorly informed, naive
person heckling me when I say in many large venues, New York,
Chicago, Los Angeles, just to name a few places, "Judges are for
sale". Hey, remember our website story "Buying A Media Job", those
positions in some instances are likewise "for sale".
There are certain similarities between the case against Coca-Cola
and the one against subsidiaries of Pepsi-Cola, PepsiCO, Inc.
In the Coke case, the local counsel
for the challenger has a sister who is media buyer for
Coca-Cola. And Coke spends upwards of ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
in the media. When it came up in Court, it was not disputed that
Coke had a spy in the camp of the one that sued Coke. The sister
became at the time unavailable to be subpoenaed, conveniently
going off to Ireland.
The Federal Judge refused to take
action and committed several frauds upon her own court including
obstructions of justice. The Federal Judge issued "rulings" with
judicial perjuries, what ordinary people call straight-out lies.
When the case went up to the federal appeals court in Chicago,
the banker-judges sitting there, sat in what the law books call
"en banc", meaning all the fourteen judges of the court sitting
at once.
Guess what? They issued an unsigned
ruling stating the challenger suing Coke cannot have his lawyer
proceed in the federal appeals court. No reason of any kind was
given. [[For many decades, the unwritten policy in the federal
courts is that the judges SIGN NONE OF THEIR COURT ORDERS,
particularly so in civil cases.
Cynics point out the judges are
"correct" since the law clerks prepared the Court Orders, not
the Judges. Many times the Judges do not even know what is in
the Court orders issued supposedly in their name.]
Thereafter, a motion to re-open the
Coca-Cola case because the judges have been operating under a malign
if not corrupt influence, was evaded. How? By sending the matter to
a secret court that supposedly investigates whether federal judges
are corrupt and take bribes.
Specific details are in "Coca-Cola, the
CIA, and the Courts", parts 9 and 10, part of our website series.
-
Briefly stated, RUSH Beverage Co., Inc.,
has the Ginseng RUSH trademark since 1978, a non-caffeinated energy
drink with American Ginseng.
They entered into an agreement with
Pepsi subsidiary South Beach Beverage Co., Inc. That has been
terminated by RUSH Beverage Co., Inc.
As shown by the court record, Pepsi's attorney procured and
instigated a burglary of the offices of RUSH Beverage Co., Inc.:
-
the Pepsi unit's attorney
procured and induced a burglary
-
they issued fraudulent subpoenas
to "cover up" the burglary
-
they obstructed the police
investigation of the burglary
-
they maintained the stolen
records, so that attorney for RUSH Beverage Co., Inc., was
not able to make objections as to the attorney-client
privilege
-
they reviewed the stolen
documents including the privileged documents of RUSH
-
they maintained the stolen
documents until after the time for dispositive motions had
expired, thus precluding RUSH from filing a dispositive
motion
-
they procured perjury, in law
talk called, suborned perjury
By the way, earlier parts of our Coke
series show how media octopus Tribune Company, owner of various
big-time newspapers, radio, and television facilities, black-mailed
the Coca-Cola federal district judge.
Why? To pressure Coca-Cola to
hand out more advertising bucks to the Tribune Company.
See the details where Tribune Company complains about the secret
proceedings of Judge Manning, how the judge blanks out court
transcripts, and,
-
such, detailed in earlier parts
of our website series "Coca-Cola, the CIA, and the Courts"
-
such as part 4, sub-titled "Is
the media monster, the Tribune Company, a reputed
blackmailer of The Coca-Cola Company?"
-
such as part 5, sub-titled "The
Blackmail machine rolls on"
-
such as part 7, sub-titled "A
real-life drama and the players", and the murder of the
Chicago Tribune reporter, a columnist on advertising and
marketing
A "natural happening" is that the
advertising/marketing expert reporter at the Tribune, taking
interest in the mess, George Lazarus, was found dead on the commuter
train on the way to his Chicago Tribune office. Foul play was
suspected.
Alright, so you did not know the media fakers use blackmail to get
advertisements. It is an old-time practice. Early in the 20th
Century, investigative journalist/whistle blower, George Seldes
wrote about it in his book, "Tell the Truth and Run".
-
In the same federal courthouse
in Chicago has been the Pepsi-Cola case. Notice the
similarity. Pepsi's attorneys procured and instigated a
burglary of the office of the RUSH Beverage Company, the one
that sued Pepsi.
Pepsi's lawyers as a cover up
issued a fake subpoena and blocked the police in the Chicago
suburb of Blue Island, from investigating. Proof was
uncovered showing Pepsi's lawyers had the stolen records.
What was in the records thus grabbed? Notes and documents
how the challenger, called a "plaintiff", Rush Beverage
Company, had confidential legal strategies how to proceed in
Court against Pepsi subsidiaries, the "defendants".
When your court enemy by
burglary gets your strategy, your enemy has spied into your
camp and knows when, where, and how you intend to attack. In
lawyer lingo, it is called "attorney-client" privilege,
which your court enemy has no right to see, certainly not by
burglarizing your office.
The plaintiff's lawyer filed some forty Motions and court
pleadings about this obstruction of justice.
Federal Judge John W. Darrah
refused to consider the matter, in so doing he committed a
fraud upon his own court and obstructions of justice. In law
talk, combining with Pepsi's attorneys and to favor Pepsi,
Judge Darrah was operating under a malign if not corrupt
influence.
The judge would not grant
sufficient time for the plaintiff's lawyer to have what is
called more "discovery", necessary to bring out more about
the burglary, and the judge quickly threw the case out of
court.
Among other things, the Judge refused
the request to refer the matter for criminal and other investigation
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney in
Chicago. The judge refused to consider the demand that Pepsi's
lawyers be disqualified from being in court in this matter
altogether.
How the plaintiff's lawyer was put under terrible, horrible pressure
is outlined in the court records. Result? That lawyer simply dropped
dead.
The foregoing are in specific court-filed
details to purge the court records as to Pepsi and to punish them and their
attorneys.
This sort of extra-ordinary procedure is seldom
invoked. Why? Because law students generally do not learn about fraud upon
the court perpetrated by a judge himself, a taboo subject.
As non-lawyers, self-educated in law, some in
our group are experts, however, on this subject. In 2001 was published a
book about how we set off the biggest judicial bribery scandal in U.S.
history, toppling Illinois' highest tribunal, the Illinois State Supreme
court, using accusations in a court-filed Motion accusing them to their
face, of fraud upon their own court after they had been bribed. In a typical
reaction, they had me as the head of our court-reform group grabbed and
clapped in jail for "contempt of court".
Later, I was vindicated and the high court was
temporarily swept away.
The book is "Illinois Justice" by law professor Kenneth A. Manaster.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
Northern District of Illinois
Eastern Division
RUSH BEVERAGE COMPANY, Plaintiff and ROBERT J. CORR, Movant, and seeking
permission to intervene if so required,
versus
SOUTH BEACH BEVERAGE COMPANY and PepsiAmericas, Inc., Defendants.
Case No. 01 C 5684-JWD
Judge John W. Darrah, Presiding.
MOTION BY ROBERT J. CORR TO PURGE THE RECORDS OF CERTAIN ORDERS,
JUDGMENTS, and RULINGS IN THE INSTANT CASE BECAUSE OF FRAUD UPON THE
U.S. DISTRICT COURT and OBSTRUCTIONS OF JUSTICE PERPETRATED BY JUDGE
JOHN W. DARRAH himself; in addition to MOTION TO INTERVENE, if so
required; and for other Relief.
Comes now Robert J. Corr, as Movant, and seeking to intervene, if so
required, pro se, and moves as follows:
(A) That this matter be sent up through
channels as a request for Certificate of Necessity, to the Chief
Justice of the United States, Washington, D.C., for the Chief
Justice to especially designate a Judge, from faraway, not of the
Seventh Circuit, to especially sit in the U.S. District Court in
Chicago, Illinois, to hear and adjudicate the instant matters.
(B) Insofar as required, Robert J. Corr, by way of this Motion,
requests permission to Intervene in the instant case, as provided
for in matters involving Fraud Upon the Federal Court Perpetrated By
a Federal Judge Himself; as hereinafter more fully set forth;
(C) That the especially designated Federal Judge, not from the
Seventh Circuit, that sits in the U.S. District Court in Chicago,
Illinois, call before the Court, by appropriate means, all those who
may be affected by the outcome of the inquiry into Fraud Upon the
U.S. District Court in Chicago and obstructions of justice
Perpetrated by Chicago U.S. District Judge John W. Darrah Himself;
that there be appointed a Master or other court official to elicit
testimony and seek and subpoena evidence and documents, and
authorized and directed to examine, investigate, and report as to
the matters herein referred to, as to the fraud upon the court and
obstructions of justice perpetrated by Judge John W. Darrah himself
and submit such report of the same to the especially designated
Judge sitting in Chicago to hear and determine the same.
(D) That the especially designated Judge purge the records, rulings,
decrees, and Judgments in the instant case, as tainted, as having
been procured by Fraud Upon the U.S. District Court in Chicago and
Obstructions of Justice Perpetrated By U.S. District John W. Darrah
Judge Himself.
(E) That the especially designated Judge, from faraway, not of the
Seventh Circuit, invoke the doctrine of "unclean hands" against the
defendants and defendants' attorneys; and purge the court records of
defendants' purported defenses, and other of their court pleadings,
including but not limited to claims made by purported
counter-claims; and enter Judgment and remedies for plaintiff, and
Robert J. Corr, and against defendants and defendants' attorneys, as
asked for in the pleadings of the plaintiff, that are in the records
of the instant case;
(F) For such other and further relief as this extra-ordinary matter
requires.
For grounds, Robert J. Corr, among other things, states, as follows:
-
That as more fully herein set forth,
this matter involves rulings, judgments, and decrees, procured and
arranged for the financial benefit of the defendants, and for
others, by Fraud Upon the U.S. District Court, Northern District of
Illinois, Eastern Division, and by obstructions of justice,
perpetrated by U.S. District Judge John W. Darrah himself.
-
The principles of law and fact involved
in such a matter are set forth in the landmark case of Root Refining
Co. v. Universal Oil Products Co., 169 F.2d 514 (3rd Circuit, 1948),
backed up by U.S. Supreme Court pertinent decisions as to
fraudulently procured rulings, involving Judges themselves operating
under a malign if not corrupt influence and perpetrating an
Obstuction of Justice by the Judges themselves.
-
There is a principle of law pertinent to
trade-mark and copyright cases, similar to patent cases.
"This matter does not concern only private parties. There are issues
of great moment to the public in a patent suit. (Citing U.S. Supreme
Court cases.) Furthermore, tampering with the administration of
justice in the manner indisputably shown here involves far more than
an injury to a single litigant. It is a wrong against the
institutions set up to protect and safeguard the public,
institutions in which fraud cannot complacently be tolerated
consistently with the good order of society.
Surely it cannot be that preservation of
the integrity of the judicial process must always wait upon the
diligence of litigants. The public welfare demands that the agencies
of public justice be not so impotent that they must always be mute
and helpless victims of deception and fraud."
Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, at page
246, 64 S.Ct. 992, at page 1001, 88 L.Ed.1250. Cited and quoted with
approval in the Root case, 169 F.2d 514, at page 522.
-
Robert J. Corr, as movant, representing
himself in the instant matter, and seeking permission to intervene
if so required, has a financial interest in the court rulings,
orders, judgments, and decrees in the instant case, procured for the
benefit of defendants and others, by obstruction of justice and
fraud upon the U.S. District Court in Chicago perpetrated by U.S.
District Judge John W. Darrah himself, as hereinafter more fully set
forth.
Robert J. Corr derives all his livelihood from the plaintiff
corporation. He has borrowed money from other persons and put the
same into the corporation. He is the sole stockholder of the
corporation.
In consideration of the details, Robert J. Corr, as an interested
party in this matter, should be granted permission to intervene.
Root Refining Co. v. Universal Oil Products Co., 169 F.2d 514, at
pages 523-524 (3rd Circuit, 1948.)
Fellow judges in the same Federal Judicial Circuit , that is the
Seventh Circuit, should not sit to hear and adjudicate the instant
matter. Rather, a Certificate of Necessity is to be submitted to the
Chief Justice of the United States, Washington, D.C., for the Chief
Justice to especially designate a judge or judges, from faraway, not
from the Seventh Circuit, to hear and determine matters involving
fraud upon the federal court and obstruction of justice perpetrated
by the Judge or Judges themselves of said Court.
See the Root case, 169 F.2d 514, at page
516, starting at the bottom of the first column and continuing to
the top of the second column on page 516.
-
Fraudulently procured court orders,
decrees, and judgments in combination with obstructions of justice,
perpetrated by federal judges themselves, as in the instant matter,
can be challenged at any time, without time limits. Root case, 169
F.2d 514, at page 522.
-
Whether orders, rulings, decrees, and
judgments have been been procured by fraud upon the court and by
obstructions of justice, the federal court inquiring into the same
as stated by the U.S. Supreme Court, "may bring before it by
appropriate means all those who may be affected by the outcome of
the investigation."
Universal Oil Products Co. v. Root Refining Co., 328 U.S. 575, at
580, 66 S.Ct. 1176, at 1179, 90 L.Ed. 1447. (Emphasis added.) Quoted
with approval, Root case, 169 F.2d 514, at 525.
-
For such purpose, the following persons
have to be brought before the Court "by appropriate means", to be
examined and cross-examined as to the matters herein:
-
U.S. District Judge John W.
Darrah, of the U.S. District Court, Chicago, Illinois
-
Sharon S. Corr, perpetrator of
the burglary at the offices of Rush Beverage Co. as
instigated and connived in by subsidiaries of Pepsico, Inc.,
defendants in the instant case and their attorneys, as
hereinafter set forth
-
Chief Kosman/Detective Cornell,
Blue Island, Illinois Police Department, investigating
police, as a burglary
-
Robert Hogan, a Private
Investigator, hired by Robert J. Corr, after the burglary
-
Walter Monco, attorney, of
Rinella & Rinella, attorneys, who represented Sharon S. Corr
in the Divorce proceedings
-
Dean Duccias, a Divorce Lawyer,
who represented Robert J. Corr in his Divorce proceedings
-
Edmund J. Ferdinand III and
Gregory Battersby, attorneys for South Beach Beverage Co.
-
John M. Murphy, David C.
Hilliard, and Robert Newbury, attorneys for Pattishall,
McAuliffe, Newbury, Hilliard & Geraldson, who represent
Pepsico and PepsiCo defendants
-
Mr. Superfine, an Attorney for
Hamman & Benn, allowed by Pattishall to see the stolen
documents.
Evidence to be elicited by the Master or
other court official to be submitted by way of a report to the
especially designated Judge to sit in Chicago in the U.S. District
Court to hear and determine the same: or other appropriate means:
All redacted documents requested to be presented and were not
supplied at the depositions of each of the defendants' attorneys.
All the Motions and Exhibits filed by attorney James L. Kurtz that
are currently not available at the Office of the Clerk of the U.S.
District Court in Chicago, Illinois.
The originals, not the copies, of the
stolen documents, being held by Pattishall, McAuliffe, et al., by
their own admissions.
-
A Master or other court official should
be appointed to elicit testimony and evidence, "authorized and
directed" to examine, investigate and report his conclusions as to
the fraud upon the court and obstructions of justice perpetrated by
Judge John W. Darrah himself, a report to the especially designated,
faraway Judge to sit in Chicago to hear and determine the same. See,
the Root case, 169 F.2d 514, at page 517 and thereafter.
FACTS NECESSARY TO BE UNDERSTOOD
-
Robert J. Corr is the sole stockholder
of Rush Beverage Company. By a series of circumstances, he has
claims of trademark and other violations against the defendants.
-
On or about June, 2001, Corr met with
attorney James Kurtz who was impressed with Corr's supporting proof
of his claims. Together, the two estimated the claims as totaling
ten million dollars against subsidiaries of Pepsi-Cola. As a
consequence of being so impressed with the details, the attorney
agreed to undertake a Federal Court case and pursue and same on a
contingency basis, a rare situation for most of those in the
intellectual property law field.
-
The instant case was filed on July 23,
2001.
-
Robert J. Corr kept in his office
extensive notes, records, notebooks, and other papers and books, as
to his confidential and privileged court legal strategies by which
he was convinced he could prevail in court against the defendants
and their attorneys.
-
One day, Corr went to his office and was
shocked that the office was bare, his confidential and privileged
materials for pursuing his claims having been cleaned out and
burglarized.
-
He later compiled the details proving
such purloined material was in the possession of the defendants'
attorneys and that they had instigated and connived in the theft of
the same. From the facts unearthed by Robert J. Corr, inferences can
properly be drawn that said attorneys were acting on behalf of their
principals, the Pepsico subsidiaries, being the defendants, and on
behalf, as well, of the parent firm, Pepsico, Inc.
-
Corr's attorney prepared and filed over
forty court-filed Motions and other pleadings, brought to the
attention of Judge John W. Darrah, detailing the burglary
instigation by the defendants' attorneys and that they had
possession of Corr's confidential and privileged records and the
defendants and their attorneys were thus in a position to defeat and
obstruct Corr's claims, the basis of his lawsuit.
As shown by the Court records, the defendants did, caused to be
done, allowed, permitted, condoned, and acquiesced in the following,
among other things:
-
induced a burglary of Robert J.
Corr's office
-
issued a fraudulent subpoena to
"cover up" the burglary
-
obstructed the police
investigation of the burglary
-
maintained and kept the stolen
documents so that Corr's attorney was not able to make
objections as to which documents were attorney-client
privileged and which were husband-wife relationship
privilege, to be kept confidential and not disclosed
-
reviewed and studied the
documents, so as to determine Corr's legal strategies for
seeking justice from Pepsi-Cola's subsidiaries; thus
obstructing justice
-
maintained and reviewed the
stolen documents until after the time had expired in the key
Judge-ordered time-table for the case; thus blockading and
excluding Corr from filing a dispositive motion
-
arranged and instigated perjury,
called suborning perjury, to damage Corr
-
Among other remedies Corr demanded of
Judge John W. Darrah, as shown by the court records:
-
that Judge John W. Darrah
suspend the proceedings and have this matter turned over to
the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney
for the Northern District of Illinois, headquartered in
Chicago, for criminal and other investigation.
-
that the defendants and their
attorneys be punished, including disqualifying the
defendants' attorneys from being in Court in this case
-
Judge Darrah cut-short the re-opening of
a proceedings called "Discovery", whereby Corr's attorney informed
Judge Darrah that the attorney wanted sufficient time to bring out
more of these obstructions of justice.
Corr's attorney said to Judge Darrah: "Your Honor, I need this
because I really believe these people have abused, and I mean abused
the court system." The transcript, that is the "Report of
Proceedings" before Judge Darrah, Oct. 15, 2002.
-
By his acts and doings, Judge Darrah
clearly demonstrated he was operating under a malign if not corrupt
influence, within the meaning of the Root case. The Judge refused to
consider the more than forty Motions and pleadings regarding the
burglary and the obstructions of justice. The Judge evaded ruling
and considering said matters, quickly entered judgment in favor of
Pepsi-Cola's subsidiaries and against Rush Beverage Co., and put the
case out of Court.
-
Corr's attorney took an appeal of the
case. The federal appeals court said the judgment of Judge Darrah
was not final and appealable and sent the case back to Judge Darrah.
In the meanwhile, Corr was repeatedly informed by his attorney,
James Kurtz, that extreme pressure was being put on him and that
Judge Darrah was part of a "whitewash" to benefit Pepsi-Cola's
subsidiaries, defendants in the case.
Kurtz was an associate and/or employee of a large law firm that
began pressuring and threatening Kurtz to drop the matter. They
fired Kurtz and Corr hired a truck and helped Kurtz move his
belongings out of Kurtz's office. Kurtz's employer/partners refused
to allow him to remove some seventeen boxes of Robert J. Corr's
original documents necessary for a trial on the merits of the
claims.
-
Corr became informed through Kurtz and
other means, that it was evident. and such inferences can be drawn,
that Pepsi-Cola's attorneys were exerting extreme pressure on Judge
Darrah and on the employer/partners of Kurtz as well, that Corr be
stopped from proceeding. By the summer of 2003, under the terrible
pressures that Kurtz repeatedly informed Corr that Kurtz was
subjected to, Kurtz simply one day dropped dead.
-
In the landmark fraud upon the court
case, implicating the judges themselves in obstructions of justice,
the special out-of-the-circuit panel, after analyzing the Master's
Report of the details, showing the judges operated under a malign if
not corrupt influence, stated, which is pertinent to the instant
matter, as to the acts and doings of the attorneys for Pepsi-Cola's
subsidiaries in combination with Judge John W. Darrah:
-
"The attorney who attempts by personal influence to control a judge
or jury in their decision in a pending case, or who merely holds
himself out as able to do so, whether or not he actually makes the
attempt, and whether or not he succeeds or fails in the attempt, in
short, an apostate lawyer, who is false to the lawyers' creed that
justice shall be undefiled, is ejected from the courts, and as a
lawyer ceases to exist. (Citing numerous cases.)"
And the special panel continues:
-
"The client who with evil intent
employs such an agent fares no better in the instant case.
To him also the doors of the courts are closed. From the
moment that he ceases to depend upon the justice of his case
and seeks discriminatory treatment, he becomes a corrupter
of the Government itself and is fortunate if he loses no
more than the rights he seeks to obtain."
And the court concludes with the remedy:
Root Refining Co. v. Universal Oil

Defendants and their attorneys and Judge
Darrah were in a position to know that Robert J. Corr, from a series
of circumstances, was impoverished and could not retain by payment,
new attorneys. When Corr came to Judge John W. Darrah's courtroom,
Corr began complaining about the illegal acts.
Judge Darrah sought to shut up Corr who
began thus to finger the Judge himself for the obstructions of
justice constituting frauds upon the court of which the Judge was
himself a part. From the language of the transcript and the
circumstances, it is proper to draw an inference that the judge was
leading up to scaring Corr by "contempt of court".
This is apparent from the Report of
Proceedings before Judge Darrah, being a "transcript" , had on July
2, 2003.
-
Judge Darrah seeks to trap and damage
Corr, as a continuation of the Judge's acts under a malign if not
corrupt influence. The Judge demands that Corr proceed to trial, yet
the Judge refused to consider the more than forty Motions and other
court-filed pleadings brought to Judge Darrah's attention and as to
which the Judge refuses to act, regarding defendants' attorneys
having the records stolen from Corr's office.
When Robert J. Corr himself came to Judge Darrah's courtroom and
began complaining to the judge about these obstructions of which the
Judge is a part, after Corr said the word "illegal", the judge began
threatening Corr, apparently that the Judge would put him in
"contempt of court" to shut up Corr from proceeding. Report of
Proceedings, July 2 ,2003.
That some Exhibits are attached hereto and made a part hereof to
show some of the specifics involved in the instant matter.
-
Robert J. Corr has been informed that
there are apparent secret financial and other links between
Pepsi-Cola and their supposed main "competitor" Coca-Cola, which
would constitute Anti-Trust violations. For example, a major
marketing and advertising firm through their Chicago unit, DDB
Chicago, has represented both Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, directly
and/or also through the parent firm.
-
Corr has also been informed that there
has been pending in the U.S. District Court in Chicago, and in the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, a matter that Corr
has been informed similarly implicates a Chicago U.S. District Judge
in apparent fraud upon her own Court and obstructions of justice, in
some ways, Corr has been informed, similar to the instant matter.
Corr has been informed that said other matter is known as Robert E.
Kolody vs. Simon Marketing and Coca-Cola Company, having been No. 97
C 190, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, Eastern
Division.
That a proper inference can be drawn as to the U.S. District Court
in Chicago, that two judges in said Courthouse are committing
obstructions of justice themselves while operating under a malign if
not corrupt influence, as in the Root case previously cited.
That two of the largest beverage firms
are thus benefitted and that said two firms, supposedly
"competitors" , have apparent secret financial and other links. A
further inference is properly drawn that the two largest beverage
firms, to beat down major claims against them, as in the instant
case, and Corr has been informed are so in the Kolody case, are the
apparent policy of procedure of these two giant beverage firms and
their attorneys.
That these situations are additional
reasons for the issuance of a Certificate of Necessity, requesting
the Chief Justice of the United States, in Washington, D.C., to
especially designate a faraway judge, not from the Seventh Federal
Judicial Circuit, to especially sit in the U.S. District Court in
Chicago to hear and adjudicate the instant matter.
Robert J. Corr, from all such
circumstances, believes he cannot reasonably expect a fair and
impartial adjudication of the instant extra-ordinary matter,
involving, as Corr contends, fraud upon the U.S. District Court and
obstructions of justice perpetrated by U.S. District Judge John W.
Darrah himself in unlawful combination with defendants' attorneys
for the benefit of Pepsico's subsidiaries, the instant defendants,
and, by proper inference, benefitting the parent firm, Pepsico, Inc.
-
As stated herein and detailed in and
supported by the more than forty Motions and pleadings which Judge
John W. Darrah refused to deal with, the defendants and defendants'
attorneys are in this case with "unclean hands". The doctrine of
"unclean hands" should be invoked against the defendants and
defendants attorneys, as asked for in opening paragraph (E).
The landmark case involving frauds upon
the court and obstructions of justice, perpetrated by the Judges
themselves in unlawful combination with certain attorneys and
party-litigants, sets forth the doctrine of "unclean hands".

Products Co., 169 F.2d 514, at pages 534-535 (3rd Circuit, 1948),

WHEREFORE, Robert J. Corr, movant and
seeking to intervene if so required, asks as in opening paragraphs
(A) through (F) inclusive, as if verbatim here set forth.

Big Bucks Judges
January 12, 2004
These series has raised issues that
Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola have ostensible secret links,
financial, marketing, and advertising, using among other things,
market and pricing tricks, to divide up among themselves the
major markets, monopolizing the same, in apparent violation of
the Anti-Trust and other Anti-Monopoly laws.
We have contended they thus
marginalize and x-out lesser beverage companies from various
major markets.
Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola have
apparently procured and instigated a propaganda attack against
our issues. At or about 3:45 p.m., Central Time, Monday, January
12, 2004, was run a segment that sounded as if Coke/Pepsi
prepared it.
That ran on "All Things Considered",
on National Public Radio. The broadcast piece asserted that
Coke/Pepsi no longer monopolize the markets, and that R.C. Cola
is now permitted to better enter the beverage markets. We
continue to believe we are correct and that Coke/Pepsi have
launched a smoke screen.
By the way, NPR is run by the
Rockefeller Family, hence we label it National PETROLEUM Radio.
Thanks to Internet and various websites, we have drawn the liars
out in the open.
- Sherman H.
Skolnick.
In America, the common-folk have somehow come to
believe that the Federal courts are the site of honest judges, not subject
to local political pressures or corruption. On the other hand, there is the
widespread perception that the state courts, unlike the federal courts, are
subject to operating pursuant to the local moneyed interests and politics.
The federal judges are generally immune from being the target of
finger-pointing in the popular press. Why?
Contrary to popular wisdom, starting as long ago as 1966, we have dared
point out as court-reformers that federal judgeships are bought and sold.
And moreso than the state courts, big bucks are involved.
[See our website story "Buying
A Judgeship".]
The federal courts are the very foundation of stiff control by the
Establishment, "the powers that be", the ultra-rich, the Ruling Class - in
short, THEM. Throughout the history of the United States, the larger outlets
of the popular press promoted the fairy tale, that the federal judges, all
the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, are not "for sale".
Seldom mentioned is a heavily-documented book that shows the major
corruption is in the U.S. Supreme Court and on-down the federal court chain.
["The History of the Supreme Court" by Gustavus Myers.] Most university and
other large law libraries do not have the book. The librarians of the same
would deny that there ever was such a book.
Many law schools have hanging on their wall a gold-framed portrait of John
Marshall. Early in the 19th Century, he was Chief Justice of the U.S.
Supreme Court for upwards of thirty five years. Law students, and later, as
members of the Bar, read and mouth-off his pronouncements as if they were
issued by a Deity, in beautiful, cast-in-stone language.
In the colonial America period, and then in the beginning of the United
States of America, the ultra-rich were principally land swindlers. By their
fundamental nature, the State Courts were well-equipped and set up to punish
the dirty business. The federal courts, all the way up to the U.S. Supreme
Court, were not. Why?
The difference is the Constitutions, of the States, as compared to that of
the Federal. Generally, State Constitutions grant great power to the central
authorities of the State and the People therein. The basic U.S. Constitution
is not that unusual of an instrument.
As a parliamentary system, the federal
Constitution has many loopholes and defects. So, early in the history of the
U.S. of A., the so-called Founding Fathers, primarily of the moneyed and
mercantile class, were forced to add a Bill of Rights. Without that, the
U.S. Constitution may not have been accepted by the common people of the
colonies. [Study the 1794 Whiskey Tax rebellion as well as the Sedition
Laws.]
Most of the first Ten Amendments repeatedly and forcefully have the word NO.
They are a shield against the tyranny of a federal central government. The
State Constitutions, on the other hand, are primarily a sword.
The U.S. Bill of Rights set forth supposed guarantees to the ordinary
people, to prevent the U.S. from having an Emperor operating with Executive
authority in conjunction with a Parliament that is "for sale", beholden to
the Aristocracy.
But early on, Chief Justice John Marshall practically destroyed the powers
of the State Constitutions. Using flowery language in Marbury versus
Madison, he took away the basic powers of the State Court Judges. Such
judges thereafter were no longer effective against the land title surveyors
and robbers, to whom the Chief Justice was obligated.
And who benefitted? Why, the Chief Justice's own brother, a land criminal.
When the high court had his brother's case, Chief Justice Marshall did NOT
disqualify himself. Guess who won in his crooked high court?
The Bench and the Bar, hand-cuffed to the media fakers, promote fairy tales.
They even have John Marshall Law School a few steps away from the Federal
Courthouse in Chicago, the Dirksen Building. Shackled to the Federal Courts,
the law professors are forever praising the federal Banker-Judges.
Another seldom-mentioned, heavily-documented book is "The Corrupt Judge" by
Joseph Borkin, published in 1962. Generally nothing happens to a crooked
federal judge in cases involving an underdog against a large corporate
interest.
On the other hand, a federal judge, as the book
points out, is subject to being crushed if the Judge gets in the middle
between two large money interests, fighting each other. This has been more so
in patent cases, much mentioned in the book. And it is true, as well, in the
related trademark and copyright cases.
[Borkin's book deals mostly with the impeachment of federal judges. On the
other hand, in the entire history of the U.S., the bulk of all the state and
federal judges ever sent to prison for bribery and other high crimes,
occurred within the last forty years, a direct result of the work of our
group, the Citizen's Committee to Clean Up the Courts.]
The key matter that may make the difference is massive publicity of federal
court corruption, often difficult to obtain.
What, on occasion, prevents a small-timer from getting Equal Justice Under
Law, are the customs, practices, and usages, a legal jargon term meaning the
entrenched not always codified habits of public officials and big money
baggers. Two block-buster cases that show this are in the Federal Courts in
Chicago.
One is a copyright and contract case against
Coca-Cola. The other is a trademark and contract case against Pepsi-Cola.
[Our website stories, Coca-Cola, the CIA, and the Courts,
Parts 9, 10, and
11]
BUYING A FEDERAL JUDGESHIP
In the Coca-Cola case, as shown by the undisputed federal court record, a
reputed gangster bought and procured the Chicago U.S. District Court
Judgeship for Judge Blanche M. Manning [(312) 435-7608.]
Paid was One Million Dollars. Part of an elite
government team contacted our group and informed us they were investigating
the buying of the judgeship by a known gangster - but, get this - that the
amount stated by my testimony in the court records, was inaccurate. They
confirmed, they said, that the gangster paid TWO MILLION DOLLARS.
The government took no action against the
gangster, however.
The traditional mafia used to be located in Chicago's old West Side, a few
blocks from the Federal Courthouse. The Mob moved just West of Chicago to Du
Page County. The former State's Attorney of Du Page County, a reputed pal of
the Mob, and willfully blind to their activities, was William J. Bauer. By
1970, he was the Chief Federal Prosecutor in Chicago, with the title of U.S.
District Attorney.
He went on to be a judicial-fixer, and cover-up
artist for major corporate criminals and sits as a Senior Circuit Judge
[(312) 435-5810 ] in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,
Chicago.
On tape we once interviewed a top official of the popular suburban
newspaper, The Daily Herald.
Citizen's Committee to Clean Up the Courts:
"As Associate Editor, can you tell us why
your publication never prints anything about the gangsters in Du Page
County that moved from the old West Side?"
Associate Editor of the Daily Herald:
"There is nothing to print. No news. There
are no gangsters, no Mafia, in Du Page."
(I presumed he was sheepish about this, afraid
the Boys would bomb his delivery trucks.)
In Du Page County was a local state court Judge, John W. Darrah, sitting in
the Du Page County Circuit Court, in Wheaton, Illinois.
In 1993, Judge Darrah stopped to talk to a
television reporter.
TV Reporter: "Judge, I see where the powers
that be have rejected you for a judgeship in the Illinois State
Appellate Court in Elgin." [Called Illinois Appellate Court, Second
District, one step below the state high tribunal, the Illinois Supreme
Court.]
Judge John W. Darrah: "Yes, I suppose that is true. I guess they must
have figured I am not acceptable."
Funny thing. Some time AFTER 1993, "the Boys",
"the Syndicate" apparently as a front for the moneyed class and the
Aristocracy, reportedly found Darrah "acceptable" and reportedly paid
several million dollars to buy and procure him a better job, as Chicago U.S.
District Judge [(312) 435-5619 ].
The Establishment would have you believe that cases when filed, are assigned
to a federal district court judge's docket by "random selection", that is,
in fairy tale style, while the Court Clerk is blind-folded picking a Judge's
name out of a fishbowl.
After years of investigating the process, we are
convinced that certain big money cases against major financial interests -
such as against the two largest beverage firms - are fixed from the
beginning. That is, the cases are corruptly assigned to a certain known
federal district judge "in" on the obstruction of justice.
A maxim we found to be true over a period of forty six years of our research
and investigations of court corruption and judicial bribery, is YOU NEED A
CROOKED CLERK'S OFFICE TO ASSIST CROOKED JUDGES.
Some years ago, because of our work, the Chief Deputy Clerk of the U.S.
District Court in Chicago, Robert P. Steine, was sent to federal
prison for various criminal offenses, getting sentenced to two five-year
prison terms.
At the time, when we first publicly accused the
Chief Deputy Clerk, the Chief Judge of the Court, William J. Campbell,
himself having escaped charges of bribery by big-time real estate interests,
was quoted in the Chicago Tribune as calling me a "liar" and my public
accusations "a diatribe".
Shortly thereafter, we also accused the Chief Clerk of the U.S. District
Court, Elbert Wagner, of various criminal offenses. BUT, he dropped dead
before he was to be indicted by a federal grand jury as a result of our
work.
CROOKED HABITS OF THE JUDGES and their GANG
In the case against Coca-Cola, plaintiff Robert E. Kolody caused to be filed
some six Motions, with specifics, that Judge Manning had perpetrated a fraud
upon her own court, while the judge was operating under a malign if not
corrupt influence to benefit Coca-Cola and their attorneys.
This included, but was not limited to, Judge
Manning committing Judicial Perjuries - straight-out lies, as shown by the
undisputed court records. To evade the accusations, the Judge fraudulently
and unlawfully changed the title of the accusing Motions.
After several other obstructions of justice occurred by the federal judges
in the federal appeals court, the case was sent to a secret court that
supposedly investigates bribery and corruption of federal judges. [See
"Coca-Cola, the CIA, and the Courts, parts 10 and 11.]
What is seldom if ever mentioned in the oil-soaked, spy-riddled monopoly
press, is that Congress has unconstitutionally abandoned their power to
investigate and impeach Federal Judges. Instead, federal judicial bribery
matters are sent to a secret court where they are torpedoed.
[Serious researchers need to study and ponder
Title 28 United States Code, Section 372.]
SITTING AS A JUDGE IN THEIR OWN CASE
Fundamental to Anglo-Saxon Law, over the centuries, is that no man can sit
as a Judge in their own case.
Despite that, implicit in what Judge Manning did
in the Coca-Cola case, she sat as a Judge in her own case, and declared
herself innocent of having corruptly obstructed justice and committed a
fraud upon her own court.
In the Pepsi-Cola case, as of the time of this posting, Chicago Federal
District Judge John W. Darrah is set to sit as a judge in his own
case, to consider Robert J. Corr's Motion to Purge, etc., accusing Judge
Darrah of specific matters that the judge committed obstructions of justice
and frauds upon his own court, while acting under a malign if not corrupt
influence, in combination with Pepsi-Cola and their attorneys. [See, Part 11
of this series.]
Hey, Judge Blanche M. Manning and Judge John W. Darrah never heard of
fundamental law? That a person cannot sit as a judge in their own case?
Have Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola used their overseas facilities to process
dope?
Part 13
Coke & Cocaine
April 2, 2004
There are many big secrets with Coca-Cola. Naturally, the monopoly press,
with their financial and espionage hang-ups and conflicts of interest, are
certainly in no position to ever tell you about it.
Since started several decades after the American Civil War, what was it that
made Coca-Cola so popular? There were already plenty of drinks that could
have been more popular.
The answer is simple. Coke had a secret formula base made up from processing
coca leaves, the by-product of which is cocaine. Up to the beginning of the
20th Century, the Coca-Cola creators did say that their beverage had
cocaine. And in 1903, they were taken to task by authorities for having
cocaine in their drink which for many years in the beginning, was available
as a soda fountain drink in pharmacies.
For a hundred years now, however, Coca-Cola Company has denied they ever had
cocaine and that they deny that it has cocaine now.
Heroin causes a physical reaction when used and a terrible wrenching of the
person when they seek to withdraw. Cocaine addiction, on the other hand, is
primarily subconscious. Up to 1989, when you started drinking Coke, you got
that "kick". Some even claimed that it had some unknown medicinal way of
making you feel better.
One long-time head of Coca-Cola Company
contended it helped relieve pain left-over from a childhood head injury he
suffered from.
But 1989 was a turning point. As we have pointed out earlier in this series,
the secret base for Coca-Cola is made by Stepan Chemical Company, of
Northfield, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, through their Maywood Chemical
Division in New Jersey.
I once interviewed, on tape, a top official of Stepan, who admitted that
cocaine was a by-product of their processing of coca leaves for the secret
Coca-Cola base, They supply, he added, cocaine for the pharmaceutical trade.
And that is where George Herbert Walker Bush has to be inserted into the
picture. After eleven and a half months in 1976 as Director of Central
Intelligence, he became a Director of Eli Lilly Company, which reportedly
gets their cocaine from Stepan. Somewhere, somehow, cocaine "leaks out" into
the dope underground.
Whether between Stepan and Coke's bottlers or
otherwise.
Daddy Bush's power and fortune, in greater part, is based from the beginning
on dope and espionage. He was with the American CIA since 1959. As shown, by
the way, by an FBI document, he helped cover up some of the
post-assassination details as to the wipe-out of President John F. Kennedy.
(The document is attached to our website series "Greenspan Aids and Bribes
Bush".)
His firm, which the British royals helped found, was Zapata Petroleum, later
called Zapata Offshore. They had branches around the world. Among other
things, they did offshore drilling for oil, beyond the U.S. and other
nation's jurisdiction. So dope production centers, like Colombia, Bolivia,
Peru, Ecuador, and others could have helicopters fly to the Zapata offshore
drilling platforms, supposedly to bring routine supplies.
Actually, according to Reuters News items some
years ago, the helicopters landed there as a transit point for the dope
trafficking.
And thus some dope ended up in the U.S. An easier way, of course, was
through "leakage" in the processing and handling of Coca-Cola's secret base.
But by 1989, blackmailers, among the top officials of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, began poking around Coca-Cola and asking sticky questions.
So Coke, in the dark brown beverage for the U.S., lessened the cocaine
content in the secret base.
It was at that point that Daddy Bush, a major baron in dope trafficking,
began making his move. That was right after he was inaugurated as U.S.
President.
He ordered U.S. Troops to invade a foreign sovereignty, Panama, having one
of the few leaders considered "of color" in the Western Hemisphere,
Manuel Noriega; kidnapped Noriega, brought him to trial in Florida.
Noriega's defense attorneys were forbidden by a
CIA-captive Federal Judge from using any details that showed that Daddy Bush
and Noriega were actually in the dope traffic together through Colombia,
adjacent to Panama. Some newspapers did run a picture showing Daddy Bush and
Noriega talking to one another at a business meeting.
(Also, the Bush Crime Family got into a business partnership with Colombia
drug-lord, Carlos Lehder, who was extradited to Florida and testified
in a way about Norieaga, protecting the Bushies. Lehder's own prison
sentence was lessened. And then, Lehder disappeared entirely from the U.S.
Prison System.
Chandra Levy wiggled her way into a key
post in the Prison System Press Office, began checking on how and why Lehder
disappeared from prison custody. And this led to her murder. See our website
series "The Chandra Levy Affair".)
Daddy Bush also in 1989, knew that CIA's involvement with driving the
Soviets out of Afghanistan was ended. AND, that the Bush Crime Family's
business partnership with Osama bin Laden and others of the bin Laden
family, in the major opium trade from Afghanistan, through Saudi, and then
to Europe, would have to come eventually under more direct control by
the
Bushies.
So, in 1989, the business of Coca-Cola Company changed, They lessened the
trace of cocaine in their beverage for distribution in the United States.
And their U.S. market share centages began leveling off. It had nothing to
do, really, with competence or incompetence of their marketing big cheeses,
their advertising agency personnel, or anything of the sort.
In the U.S., those opening up a container of
Coke did not get that same "kick" they got from the drink in years past.
On the other hand, elsewhere in the world, sales of Coke outran most every
local beverage. And there were plenty of foreign beverages with traditional
flavors. Yet, Coke outsold them.
WHY? Simple. For foreign consumption Coke
had cocaine in the secret base.
So those drinking Coke overseas, subconsciously got addicted to Coca-Cola.
It made them feel better, some thought it even made certain pains and
troubles seem to go away. And Coke's marketing experts spread the fairy tale
that it had to do with their great brilliant advertisements on television,
even in places where only ten per cent of the populace had TV sets.
But some foreign governments began reacting. Overseas, Coke did not
contribute heavily to local charities, high school sports teams, and such,
as they do in the U.S. So, in Belgium, Spain, Italy, and India, among
numerous other places, the authorities swooped down on Coke. There were
claims that Coke allowed toxic substances to get into the drink. There were
claims of Coke not keeping proper records. Whole offices of Coke's records
and equipment were hauled away, to send a message to Atlanta, Georgia,
Coke's headquarters.
In a way, it was also sending a message to the bosses at the American spy
agency, so directly hooked to Coca-Cola. Coke's overseas offices, like those
in the monopoly press, are vacuum pumps for intelligence, more so than for
gathering news or marketing the beverage whose great worldwide demand is
driven by the subconscious addiction to cocaine in Coca-Cola.
And Coke developed other strange situations. They set up in Ireland, a major
center for putting their ingredients together including the secret base
containing cocaine. There were reports, difficult to get anyone to publicly
confirm, that the IRA (the Irish Republican Army) had some arm-lock on the
plant in Ireland putting together the Coca-Cola concentrate. (That is not to
say, that ALL of those in the IRA had something to do with this.)
And then there were published reports that the IRA together with the Russian
mafia, were active in the dope trafficking from Colombia. The Bush White
House, seldom mentioned, has sent several thousand U.S. Troops into Colombia
to protect Coca-Cola's facilities and their purported purchases, by them, or
their secret base processors, of coca leaves.
The most mysterious development of 1989? Somehow, Coca-Cola Company failed
to renew their copyright. And so, it is now owned by a skilled storyboard
producer in Indiana. See the earlier parts of this series of those details.
And as stated in the earlier parts of this series, starting later in the
1990s, was the corruption of the Federal Judges in Chicago as to a copyright
case against Coca-Cola. And, aided by Coca-Cola dope funds, the corruption
in 2000, of some of the 5-Judge, military-style Junta on the U.S. Supreme
Court in the Bush versus Gore litigation installing Bush as the resident and
occupant of the Oval Office.
(For details see earlier parts of this series.)
In February, 2004 was published "The Real Thing - Truth and Power at the
Coca-Cola Company" by Constance L. Hays, a writer for the New York
Times; Random House publishers. She continues the fairy tale in her book
that Coca-Cola is getting more popular overseas because of the great
marketing and advertising efforts of Coca-Cola.
She has reportedly also stated that the trace of
cocaine in Coke ended in 1989.
Part 14
Disclosures of Corruption of The US Supreme
Court
Blocked by The FBI and Homeland Security
December 21, 2004
It was the year 2004. The U.S. Presidential
Election was set for November 2.
The bosses of the newly-minted Homeland Security
were worried. Their primary purpose was to root out dissidents, soon as
possible, that could disturb the agenda of the Anglo-American Aristocracy
that owns and operates the occupant and resident of the White House,
George
W. Bush. who is a stooge and scapegoat for their program of ruling WITHOUT
THE CONSENT OF THOSE GOVERNED, a horrendous violation of the organic law,
the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
Not for small reasons did critics call them the American Gestapo.
After all, their title, Homeland Security, was
the English-language equivalent of the Nazi-era secret political police. And
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, sort of aides to them, has an awful
historical background. A dirty little secret is that NO CHARTER PROVIDES FOR
THE EXISTENCE OF FBI. Nowadays, who dares mention such things?
By 2004, some savvy folks persisted in grumbling that in a five-to-four
decision, in December, 2000, the Supreme Court of the United States
installed George W. Bush as the occupant and resident of the White House.
Some refuse to call him "Mr. President".
The duly elected President, NOT inaugurated,
Albert Gore, Jr., never actually conceded defeat. Some people forgot that.
The ruling of the Five-Judge majority in Bush versus Gore was arbitrary.
Even worse, some knew the five-judge Military-Style Junta had been
corrupted. Judges on the High Court wear two hats. One, as a Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States. Secondly and little known, each is also
a Circuit Justice, supervising one or more U.S. Courts of Appeal, one step
below the Supreme Court of the United States.
As Associate Justice, John Paul Stevens, as part of the Dissenting
Four Judges, in Bush versus Gore, wrote the most blistering
dissenting opinion probably in the history of the high tribunal.
[In 1969, I directly accused the Judges on
the Illinois Supreme Court, that state's highest tribunal. of bribery.
It became the biggest judicial bribery scandal in the nation's history
up to that time.
A Special Commission was put together to
consider my accusations. Since I was self-educated in law but not a
member of the Bar, they demanded, despite my outspoken objections at
that time, that a lawyer be appointed to represent me and present my
accusations, namely John Paul Stevens.
The state high court was just about swept
away by the judicial earthquake that occurred; the Chief Justice and an
Associate Justice resigned and a third Justice, while under fire from
me, simply croaked. Issued in the name of that third judge, dated and
signed by him - now get this - supposedly a month after he was dead and
buried was an important steel company decision.
Ten days AFTER the effective resignation
date of the two other judges was issued in their name, and dated, a
supposedly valid decision upholding the state Income Tax as
Constitutional.
Corruption does not go away that easy.
Before that, while yet on the bench, the judges jailed me, wheelchair
and all, for the judge-made offense of "contempt of court" as the head
of our court-reform group because I refused to divulge to the
bribe-tainted judges the methods we use to finger judges and lawyers for
bribery. Later, I was released and vindicated.
Stevens and I became famous. A few years later, he was appointed to the
Supreme Court of the United States. More than thirty years later, a law
professor wrote a book about the 1969 scandal, "Illinois Justice" by
Kenneth Manaster.
Pictured with me on the cover of the book,
Stevens, about the only Judge ever to have a public good word to say
about me, a loudmouth Judge-buster, wrote the forward to the book. See
the Home Page,
www.skolnicksreport.com ]
As I have written, John F. Kerry's "wife of
convenience", billionaire heiress to the Heinz Ketchup fortune, Teresa
Heinz Kerry, a long-time rabid ultra-right Republican, long prior to the
year 2004 Election, made an unholy deal with the GOP.
In return for a promise of a horde of gold, she
would see to it that John, a purported "Democrat" with a little-known
British intelligence agency background, "lay down and play dead", sort of
like a typical crooked wrestler in a heavily gambled upon match. [See my
story, "Overthrow of the American Republic", part 64, "Buying
& Selling the U.S. Presidency".]
BUT, two groups were at work, months before the 2004 Election, with details
that could have wrecked the rotten tricks set to re-install George W. Bush
as the resident and occupant of the White House.
-
Operating in the Chicago-area is a
court-reform group, of which since 1963, I am the Founder/Chairman.
One member of that group was putting
together some four hundred pages of documents relating to
Coca-Cola's role in corrupting all the judges in active service,
sitting in what is known in law lingo as en banc, all together, some
fourteen judges in a case against Coke in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit, headquartered in Chicago. Seventh Circuit
Justice Stevens supervises that Court.
Because the corruption involved all the judges of that federal
appeals court and in related situations, some of the five-judge
majority in Bush versus Gore, on the Supreme Court of the United
States; the one suing Coca-Cola, Robert E. Kolody, made an
Application to Seventh Circuit Justice John Paul Stevens that he
arrange a special panel of judges, from outside the Seventh Circuit,
to hear and determine the judicial corruption matter, of Judges on
the Chicago federal appeals court as well as those on the high court
in Washington, D.C., committing a fraud upon their own Court and
obstructing the same.
Unknown to most, Homeland Security and the FBI have a virtual wall
around the Supreme Court of the United States. This all started with
the "anthrax terror" first publicized shortly after 9-11.
The apparent real culprit is a
super-duper Russian biochemist who is a defector. He heads up a
company, under contract to the American CIA, to develop, perfect,
and test the usage of weaponized anthrax. To sidestep the
geopolitical problems in investigating this situation, the FBI,
instead, saw fit to try to blame the anthrax mess on someone else,
apparently not really involved.
Apparently contaminated, or possibly so, with weaponized anthrax or
similar, powder leaking from envelopes were in the offices of media
big-shots; Congress; the Supreme Court of the United States; as well
as one or more major U.S. Post Office facilities.
It was the perfect excuse to violate the U.S. Constitution's mandate
of "Separation of Powers". Already illegally in existence, with no
Charter, the FBI, together with the newly setup Homeland Security,
both supposedly of the Executive branch of the U.S. central
Government, took command of the Supreme Court of the United States,
plainly part of the Judicial branch of the Government.
They decided who, if anyone, would be permitted in person, by U.S.
Mail, or other transportation ways, to communicate with those in the
headquarters building of the Supreme Court of the United States. For
that purpose, a remote warehouse was used. All mail, packages, and
such, would have to go there, under the absolute examination and
supervision of Homeland Security and FBI, secretly or otherwise.
With the connivance of Court clerks and employees inside the
headquarters building of the Supreme Court of the United States, as
well as those in the remote warehouse and enroute to the
headquarters building; it was a perfect obstruction of justice
scheme.
-
Running on a parallel track, with
apparent knowledge of the first group, was a group of investigative
reporters of Vanity Fair Magazine.
Without mentioning the first group by
name or detail, the Magazine group starting many months before the
2004 Presidential Election, was to start to divulge some of their
work for the October 2004 monthly issue of Vanity Fair, set to be
distributed and circulated about September 27th, just a few weeks
before the Election.
Both the first and second group were in a position to know that some
of the "Gang of Five" judges in Bush versus Gore, had
complained to the FBI and Homeland Security, some of the following:
-
each of the judges of the
Supreme Court of the United States typically has five law
clerks who look up prior decisions, write or assist to write
decisions on pending matters, and prepare the decisions to
be printed in the printing plant historically contained
within the headquarters building.
The law clerks are pledged to absolute secrecy. After
serving several years as a high court law clerk, they can
usually expect to be hired by a big bucks law-firm at a
salary of some two hundred thousand dollars a year. Not
something to be lightly thrown away with little
consideration of the consequences.
For the first time in the history of the high court, some of
the law clerks of some of the four dissenting judges in Bush
versus Gore, at great danger to themselves and their later
careers, went public. They spoke to the reporters of Vanity
Fair and others.
They told how Justice Antonin
Scalia, a Fascist-inclined Judge of the "Gang of Five", was
"Hell bent" on stopping the crucial Florida recount of the
ballots, with Florida being the necessary vote to put the
winner over the top for the necessary Electoral College
vote.
Scalia was Hell bent on stopping
Gore from becoming President-Elect; so was Chief Justice
Rehnquist and O'Connor, both telling friends they cannot, as
they planned, retire if Gore gets elected.
The law clerks often work late, long after the Justices have
left for the day; such as the night before release of a
decision. So the law clerks have all the keys to the place.
According to Antonin Scalia and
others of the Five, some of the law clerks of the Four
swiped private papers from various locked drawers of the
Five; some of these papers related to handwritten type notes
of the Five to some of the Four making threats by some of
the Five that could or would constitute federal criminal
offenses, threatening a federal government official.
According to some law clerks of
the Four, Scalia tried every dirty trick to stop John Paul
Stevens from having time enough to write a Dissenting
Opinion in Bush versus Gore.
Some of these details got into the
October 2004 issue of Vanity Fair Magazine.
Other details were revealed on a
forty-minute segment on National Public Radio on the Terry Gross
Show interviewing one of the magazine's reporters. Such as that
Antonin Scalia strong-armed one of the Four dissenting Judges in
Bush versus Gore to remove a revealing footnote from their separate
Dissenting Opinion.
Right after the Vanity Fair publishing their report, one or more law
review articles condemned the law clerks who broke the pledge of
silence. Various Judges and law clerks of other courts howled
against the law clerks of the Four dissenting Judges in Bush versus
Gore.
The law clerks for the dissenters,
defending themselves against being condemned by others of the Bench
and the Bar, stated that the serious offenses committed by the Five
Judge Majority in Bush versus Gore, released the law clerks from
their pledge of secrecy.
FBI and Homeland Security sped up their persistent spying on the
Four Dissenting Judges and their law clerks, harassing them in
various devilish ways. FBI and Homeland Security claim that the ring
leader of the Four is Justice John Paul Stevens and that
somehow, through intermediaries he communicates with those outside
the headquarters building of the high court.
Stevens has reportedly been accused of
being a part of a plot to Overthrow the U.S. central government by
discrediting the Supreme Court of the United States by profound
scandal because Five, of the Nine, on the Court are accused of
corrupt acts and doings in Bush versus Gore.
Some at FBI and Homeland Security have raised the question that
Sherman H. Skolnick is part of this plot.
To understand more about this, refer to the
entire series, "Coca-Cola, the CIA, and the Courts", parts 1 through 13
(far above)
inclusive. In particular study the court documents attached to
Part 9 and
the document about the Secret Court in
Part 10.
Set out below is, verbatim, a related document. The letter dated "5/7/2004",
mentioned therein, .. once thought to be an erroneous date pre-dating the
sending of the packages is actually revealing and apparently not erroneous.
That date was supposed to have been a secret and
apparently refers to the date on or about which the law clerks for some of
the dissenting judges in Bush versus Gore somehow latched onto certain
records of Justice Antonin Scalia proving his corruption and criminality in
the litigation where he was the so-called team leader of the five-judge
majority.
Does that qualify as a magnificent blunder by
the cover up specialists?

NOTICE OF CLAIMS PRIOR TO SUIT
December 20, 2004
To: William K. Suter, individually and as purported Clerk of the Supreme
Court of the United States
One First Avenue, N.E.
Washington, D.C. 20543
(202) 479-3014;
Gail Johnson, individually and as purported Deputy Clerk and/or
purported employee of the Supreme Court of the United States.
Clerk's Office
One First Avenue, N.E.,
Washington, D.C. 20543
(202) 479-3038;
You and each of you are and have been,
together with persons directly associated with you and with whom you are
and have been directly acting in respect to Robert E. Kolody and the
matters herein mentioned, in a position to know, as follows:
-
That the persons and entities actually
involved with the purported "anthrax scare" or "anthrax terror"
starting in the United States, on or about later in September, 2001,
are known to the highest authorities within the Federal Executive
Department bureaucracy.
-
That because of conflicting interests
within the Executive Department of the U.S. Government, that said
true perpetrators are not publicly accused or identified, because,
among other reasons, they are interwoven with the operations of
certain U.S. intelligence operatives and agencies.
-
As a consequence of a purported "anthrax
scare" purportedly targeting the Supreme Court of the United States,
and its headquarters, you, and each of you, and persons directly
associated with you and in combination with whom you are directly
acting, and have been acting, allowing, permitting, condoning and
acquiescing in the following:
-
That the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, for which there is no Charter authorizing
their existence, and later, the Federal agency known as
Homeland Security; both; purporting to be of the Executive
branch of the U.S. central government ; that said purported
agencies set up and/or began using, a warehouse, not within
the headquarters building of the Supreme Court of the United
States.
-
That said remotely located
purported warehouse is and has been, part of an unlawful
plan or scheme, to obstruct, evade, and nullify, efforts of
those who rightfully and lawfully seek to communicate with
persons having offices within the headquarters building of
the Supreme Court of the United States, whether via United
States Postal Service, Federal Express, or other
transportation means.
For example, in respect to
Kolody, that said obstructed communications related to
corruption of certain Judges on the Supreme Court of the
United States, in litigation commonly known as Bush versus
Gore, and related corruption of Judges on the United States
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, headquartered in
Chicago, Illinois, in litigation Robert E. Kolody versus
Simon Marketing and Coca-Cola Company.
-
On October 14, 2004, the undersigned,
Robert E. Kolody, sent a package properly and lawfully addressed to
John Paul Stevens, not in his capacity as Associate Justice of the
United States, but to Stevens in his capacity as Seventh Circuit
Justice, supervising, among others, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.
-
Said package was sent by Kolody via
Registered Mail, Return Receipt Requested, Registered Mail Number RA
785544000 US
-
On 10/22/2004, a package arrived at
Kolody's home address from Clerk's Office, Supreme Court of the
United States. On it was a printed, office-supply-store-type label,
"RECEIVED IN DAMAGED CONDITION". Said package had a postage meter
purportedly indicating it was sent on 10/19/2004.
The package contained just two of
Kolody's Applications for Certificate of Necessity and just two
copies of supporting Exhibits, which Kolody had properly and
lawfully addressed to Seventh Circuit Justice John Paul Stevens, in
his capacity supervising the Seventh Circuit. No letter of
explanation was contained in said package received by Kolody.
-
On 10/25/2004, on the phone, Kolody
spoke to John Kouros, the person identifying himself as the
"Manager" or similar title, of the purported remotely located
"warehouse". Said person led Kolody to know, believe, and
understand, that said person was aware of the package from Kolody;
that said package did not arrive damaged; that said package was
forwarded to certain other persons and entities.
-
On 10/25/2004, by phone, Kolody spoke to
Gail Johnson in the headquarters building. Kolody in substance,
complained that part of the contents of his package, arrived back to
him with the cryptic printed label as mentioned, with only part of
the contents of the package he sent.
-
On 10/27/2004, there arrived at Kolody's
home address, a package containing the additional nine copies, being
the balance of the contents of the original package that Kolody had
rightfully and lawfully addressed to Seventh Circuit Justice John
Paul Stevens. This package contained a purported letter, dated
5/7/2004, from William K. Suter and Gail Johnson.
Said letter, in substance, made the
false and perjurious statement that Kolody had sent his package to
the wrong place. On November 1, 2004, Kolody received a letter,
marked "COPY", dated 10/18/2004, the same words as in the letter
falsely dated "5/7/2004".
-
Said package originally sent by Kolody
contained copies directed to Seventh Circuit Justice John Paul
Stevens, in his supervisory capacity as mentioned. Kolody made
Application, supported by some four hundred pages of documentation,
to Stevens for a Certificate of Necessity.
-
Kolody asked Seventh Circuit Justice
John Paul Stevens to arrange to have designated a panel of Judges,
not from the Seventh Circuit, to especially sit in Chicago, to hear
and determine Kolody's Motion to Purge The Judgments, Rulings, and
Decrees in Kolody's Seventh Circuit litigation, said rulings having
been obtained by frauds upon the United States Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit, and obstructions of justice, perpetrated by the
Judges themselves of said Court upon their own Court.
-
Kolody pointed out that the fraud upon
the court also was related to the fraud upon the Supreme Court of
the United States, in the litigation commonly known as Bush versus
Gore, perpetrated by some of the five judges that issued a purported
majority ruling installing George W. Bush corruptly and arbitrarily
as the occupant and resident of the Oval Office.
-
Kolody pointed out that the fraud upon
the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit was done
by all the judges on that court in active service, sitting in what
is known as en banc, that is, all sitting at one time. perpetrating
a fraud upon their own Court and obstructions of justice upon their
own Court, as shown in the some four hundred pages of supporting
documentation sent to Stevens with the Application for Certificate
of Necessity.
-
Kolody pointed out that his
documentation in support of this included that the Clerk of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, unlawfully
delegated to himself, the Judicial authority to make Judicial
rulings on said Motion to Purge, disregarding the case law
precedents mentioned in said Motion.
Such as Root Refining Co. versus
Universal Oil Products, Co., 169 F.2d 514 ( 3rd Circuit, 1948);
namely that a U.S. Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to
inquire at any time, without regard to statutes of limitations, as
to whether its Judgments, Rulings, and Decrees are tainted, and
subject to being purged, having been obtained by a malign if not
corrupt influence on such U.S. Court of Appeals.
In the Root case, since the corruption
involved Judges on the United States Court of Appeals, judges from
outside that Circuit, were especially designated to sit and
determine the extra-ordinary matter, within that Circuit, to inquire
into said matter.
Such special out-of-Circuit panel, the Root case
states, has to call before it all the persons involved by way of
unearthing the fraud upon the United States Court of Appeals, and
thereafter, to purge the records favoring certain malefactors and
corrupters in said litigation.
-
Kolody's said documentation shows that.
prior to his Application for Certificate of Necessity to Stevens,
that Kolody's Motion to Purge was sent to an apparent secret court,
that purports to consider apparent misdeeds, corruption, and bribery
of Federal Judges.
That said secret court has no public
record location where it sits, no public records, no public
available title of the proceeding, no public record of the cause
number or other reference, and no public issued determination as to
what, if anything, is done about the documentation of corrupt acts
and doings of certain Federal Judges.
On the other hand, the Root case, cited by Kolody in his Motion to
Purge, requires public hearings, public record identification of the
corrupt federal appeals Judges implicated, public record
identification of the lawyers and public officials implicated, and
public record announcement of the remedy of the corruption as
determined by the out-of-Circuit special panel of Judges.
-
That on 11/22/2004, Kolody properly and
lawfully addressed and sent to Seventh Circuit Justice John Paul
Stevens, a further package, again making Application for Certificate
of Necessity; via Registered Mail, Return Receipt Requested,
Registered Mail Number RB 361395565 US, that Stevens, in his
capacity as supervising Justice of the Seventh Circuit, arrange to
have out-of-Seventh Circuit panel of Judges to hear and determine
the matter of Kolody's Motion to Purge, and as it relates to the
corruption of some of the five Supreme Court of the United States
Justices in the litigation known as Bush versus Gore.
-
In a letter to Kolody, dated November
30, 2004, William K. Suter and Gail Johnson, made, in substance, the
selfsame false and perjurious statement identical to the previous
one in letter marked "COPY" and dated 10/18/2004, that Kolody's
Application For Certificate of Necessity to have been received by
Seventh Circuit Justice in his capacity as supervising the United
States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, was sent to the
wrong place.
-
A very small piece of what this is all
about, without referring at all to Kolody, is contained in the
October, 2004 issue of Vanity Fair Magazine.
-
Plainly, the headquarters building of
the Supreme Court of the United States, is obviously that of the
Judicial branch of the U.S. central government, according to Article
Three of the U.S. Constitution.
Purported units of the Executive branch
of the central government of the United States, namely the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and Homeland Security, have by unlawful acts
and doings, built a virtual wall around the headquarters building
housing the Supreme Court of the United States, by "anthrax terror"
tricks supposedly justifying blockading, obstructing, and nullifying
any attempts to have properly delivered papers supported by
extensive documentation as to the corrupt acts and doings of federal
appeals judges, one step below the high court, and to corrupt acts
and doings of some of the five judges in the high court in their
unlawful, corrupt, and arbitrary installation of George W. Bush as
the occupant and resident of the White House, in 2000.
-
As a matter of record, John Paul
Stevens, in the litigation known as Bush versus Gore, issued a
blistering dissent condemning what the five Judge majority had done.
Some of those investigating how some of
the law clerks, of the four Dissenting high court justices, went
public with the corrupt doings of the five judge majority; that
found out was that the team leader for the five of the Majority, was
Justice Antonin Scalia who was "Hell bent" to stop Gore from
properly winning the Electoral College vote revolving around Florida
in 2000.
And, further, that Scalia attempted to
blockade Stevens from having time to prepare and present his
Dissenting opinion in Bush versus Gore. And that some of the five
Majority judges sent private notes to some of the Dissenting four
judges, notes which seem to constitute federal criminal offenses for
threats against such Dissenting Judges for not remaining silent and
not joining with the five Majority to unlawfully and corruptly
install Bush as the occupant and resident of the White House.
-
Under the U.S. Constitution's provisions
for "Separation of Powers", the purported units of the Executive
branch of the U.S. central Government, namely FBI and Homeland
Security, have no lawful authority to be controlling what someone,
like Kolody, properly and lawfully sends, regarding high judicial
corruption, to a supervising Circuit Justice, such as Stevens, or to
hound and torment Stevens and his law clerks, and other Dissenting
Justices and their law clerks, as these two purported Executive
branch agencies have done, regarding the five judge Majority's
corrupt acts and doings in Bush versus Gore related to Coca-Cola's
corruption of said Judges.
-
William K. Suter,individually and as
purported Clerk of the Supreme Court of the United States, and Gail
Johnson individually and as purported Deputy Clerk and/or Employee
of said Court, have by their acts and doings, aided and abetted the
unlawful acts and doings of the FBI and Homeland Security. That
Robert E. Kolody has, as a consequence, been damaged in his
copyright and contract rights, and in his Constitutionally
guaranteed and protected rights to Due and orderly Processes of Law
and the Equal Protection of the Laws.
-
That Kolody's opponent, Coca-Cola
Company, is implicated in the corruption of the Judges of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit as well as the
related corruption of some of the five Majority Judges of the
Supreme Court of the United States, in Bush versus Gore.
-
Kolody because of the foregoing
corruption and wrongdoing, has been damaged to a total well over a
Billion Dollars and so herein and hereby claims.
-
THAT ROBERT E. KOLODY HEREBY INFORMS
WILLIAM K. SUTER and GAIL JOHNSON that ROBERT E. KOLODY in due
course intends in a court of competent jurisdiction to bring a
damage suit against them, individually and in their capacity as
supposed public officials, as named defendants having joined in
combination with others to greatly damage Kolody.

Part 15
Pepsi Accused Of Using 'Corruptly Begotten'
Court Judgments Implicating Federal Judge
February 17, 2005
To defeat intellectual property claims against
them, the two major beverage companies worked a corrupt influence on Federal
Judges in Chicago.
The Coca-Cola case started, as I set forth in this series, before Chicago
U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning. Obviously, I ran a jeopardy as
head of a court reform group when I was brought in as a witness against her
in her Court as to her corruption.
My written statement in the Court record
points to a gangster who paid one million dollars to buy her the Judgeship.
[I was later contacted by a supposedly elite government investigating group.
As to my federal court presentations in the Coca-Cola case, they said they
were going to immediately grill gangster William F. Cellini, a gangster who
I contended in the Coca-Cola case buys and sells federal judgeships and
bought Manning the federal district court judgeship for one million dollars.
When the supposedly elite group contacted me the second time, they said,
"Mr. Skolnick, your federal court testimony
is NOT accurate."
Puzzled, I responded,
"In what way?"
They answered,
"The gangster paid two million dollars, not
one million".
Outraged, I demanded,
"And what are YOU going to do about THAT?"
They simply stated,
"We'll let you know".
They never contacted me further and apparently
did nothing against Cellini, a major power broker.
Cellini reportedly under various names including
Argosy Gaming and similar, owns and operates nationwide gambling casinos,
and apparently because of "muscle" gets kickbacks from other casinos of what
is known in the trade as Three Points. The highly corrupt IRS seems not to
notice anything. Also, for many years covered up by the monopoly press and
corrupt state and federal officials, was that Cellini's sister.
Janice Cellini, for many years Administrative
executive assistant to Illinois Governors installed corruptly by her
brother, was an unindicted co-conspirator in a huge embezzlement by computer
consultants swindling the Illinois Public Aid Department.]
In the presence of Judge Manning, I was asked what I do. Under oath, I
testified I lead investigations of judges suspected of bribery for the
purpose of fingering them and putting them in prison.
To try to scare me, during my testimony, the Judge had six very sinister
looking Federal Police sitting nearby ready to jump on me. Earlier, the
Judge had insisted that despite I was a public access cable television
journalist and program producer, that I put myself with my wheelchair all
the way to the rear of the court by the court door.
When I protested I could not hear the proceedings from that distance, one of
the toughest of the Federal Police got up and started right for me to grab
me. I ended the stand-off by suggesting I sit directly next to one of the
police with a radio-like earpiece in his ear.
The Judge refused to consider six Motions that she had perpetrated frauds
upon her own Court. Not disputed was that the plaintiff Robert E. Kolody
accusing Coca-Cola of copyright violations, had for some ten years a lawyer
who later confessed to me in the presence of witnesses that his sister was
media buyer for Coke. By this method, he admitted Coke was able to spy on
Kolody and torpedo his confidential legal strategies.
During my testimony, I pointed to that lawyer,
Dan Hanley, present in Court who did not dispute his confession.
(That lawyer was reportedly a close relative of
Edward Hanley, the gangster that for many years ran the hoodlum-controlled
Hotel Workers Union which was also reportedly tied to Judge Manning. When
Jesse Jackson, Jr. ran to fill a vacancy in a Congressional District in
Chicago in 1995, reporters on a radio show asked him what he did to be paid
fifty nine thousand dollars from the gangster-riddled Hotel Workers Union.
He could not give a straight answer. Asked if he knew of his boss, Edward
Hanley, running the Union and a known hoodlum, he asserted with a straight
face that he never heard of his boss.)
In the process of investigating his sister, Mary Hanley, an official of the
marketing and advertising firm DDB Chicago, I found out that Coca-Cola and
Pepsi-Cola are owned by the same financial interests and only pretend to be
worldwide competitors. Further, DDB Chicago quietly represented both Pepsi
and Coke. All these things are Anti-Trust violations which the highly
politicized and corrupt Justice Department has failed to do anything about.
Later, in the Federal Appeals Court, all the judges of that Court, some 14,
sitting what they call en banc, together, blockaded the Kolody appeal from
proceeding.
Still later, the plaintiff Kolody filed court
documents setting forth that the corruption in the Coca-Cola case is linked
to the corrupting of five Judges on the U.S. Supreme Court in Bush versus
Gore, to arbitrarily install George W. Bush in December, 2000, as the
occupant and resident of the White House.
The documents relating to this judicial corruption were sent to a Secret
Court that considers matters of misdeeds of Federal Judges including
bribery. Unknown to the public, such Court has no case number, no docket or
procedures of record, and meeting place is unknown.
In 2004, Homeland Security and the FBI arbitrarily twice blocked heavy
packages of documents relating to the High Court corruption in Bush versus
Gore from getting to one of the U.S. Supreme Court Justices, John Paul
Stevens (in his second capacity as 7th Circuit Justice supervising the
federal appeals court in Chicago).
Stevens who with three other High Court Justices
dissented in Bush Versus Gore. Justice Stevens' dissent is considered the
most outspoken in the two hundred year history of the High Court.
[In 1969, in the biggest judicial bribery mess in American history up to
that time, Stevens, as a Chicago lawyer, was my attorney presenting my
charges of bribery against some of the Judges of the Illinois Supreme Court,
that state's highest tribunal which was nearly swept away by the
disclosures. As a result, I and Stevens became famous. He was later
appointed to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court, his current position for more
than thirty years. For details, see
Part 14. Not
mentioning us by name, is a small part of our work on the U.S. Supreme Court
corruption of Five of their Judges: in the October, 2004 issue of Vanity
Fair Magazine.]
[See parts 9 and
10 of this series as to
the Secret Court's existence. Other numerous details in other parts of this
series as to Coca-Cola.]
As to Pepsi-Cola, the other major worldwide beverage company:
The owner of a Chicago-area-based beverage
firm, filed on February 15, 2005, a civil damage suit in the state court
in Chicago, being in Cook County. Named as defendants are Pepsico, Inc.,
several of their units, and two law firms and lawyers representing them.
Among the law firms named as defendants are
Pattishall, McAuliffe, Murphy, Newberry, Hilliard & Geraldson, 311 South
Wacker Drive, Suite 5000, Chicago IL 60606 (312) 554-8000 ; and Grimes &
Battersby, 488 Main Ave., Third Floor, Norwalk, Connecticut 06851 (203)
849-8300.
Robert J. Corr owner of Rush Beverage
Company, Inc., of the Chicago suburb of Blue Island, sets forth in his
Verified Complaint with Exhibit attached, as follows:
That Chicago U.S. District Judge John W. Darrah (312) 435-5619 [Federal
civil action, No. 01 C-5684 ] for the Pepsi defendants' and their attorneys
huge financial benefits, did Frauds Upon the U.S. District Court and
Obstructions of Justice, Perpetrated by Judge Darrah himself on his Own
Court.
Judge Darrah condoned and acquiesced in, as stated, in the Complaint by Corr,
that Pepsico and their attorneys arranged the burglary of most of Corr's
office and benefitted from that.. Stolen were his trade secrets,
confidential books and records, documents and papers.
All the burglarized items were delivered in garbage bags to the Pepsico
attorneys who admitted they had the same but refused to return the original
records to Corr despite his repeated demands.
Original records, rather than machine copies, are the most effective
evidence to prove claims at trials and elsewhere. Original records are not
as subject to dispute and rejection as machine copies would be.
Under a malign if not corrupt influence by the defendants, Judge Darrah cut
short Corr from having Pepsi's attorneys adequately questioned.
Deprived of his records, Corr could not timely renew the registration of his
trade mark as to which he sued Pepsi in the federal court.
[For many years previous to the federal case,
"Red Bull" beverage tried to knockout Corr's trademark "Ginseng Rush",
linked to his beverages marketed by Corr through his firm, Rush Beverage
Co., Inc. Corr's beverage is made with American Ginseng, according to
published sources, of a superior quality and more expensive than Ginseng
supposedly in some other beverages with Korean Ginseng. Corr contends his
beverage is good for one's health. On the other hand, "Red Bull" is
reputedly heavily caffeinated. Corr says he is against other beverages which
have almost a toxic level of caffeine. Also, neither Coca-Cola nor
Pepsi-Cola can legally claim their bubble water has any nutrition value.]
In January, 2004, in the Federal Court, Corr filed "Motion By Robert Corr To
Purge The Records Of Certain Orders, Judgments, and Rulings In The Instant
Case Because of Fraud Upon the U.S. District Court and Obstructions of
Justice Perpetrated By Judge John W. Darrah Himself".
It is a fundamental principle of Anglo-Saxon Law, that,
"No Man Shall Sit As
A Judge In His Own Case".
Unlawfully sitting as a Judge in his own case,
Judge Darrah stating the entire title of the motion, ruled on February 19,
2004, that such "Motion... is Denied"
Please notice: In law the words Motion is
Denied, does NOT mean the facts are disputed but rather that the Motion is
not granted. The Judge, Pepsi, their units, and lawyers DID NOT DISPUTE the
FACTS of the malign influence on Judge Darrah to enter Judgments arbitrarily
destroying Corr's intellectual and contract property rights.
In his State Court suit, Corr claims the named Pepsi defendants are wielding
and using against him corruptly and fraudulently begotten federal court
judgments, orders, and rulings, defendants having worked a malign influence
on Judge Darrah to obtain the same. In this way, the Pepsi defendants, with
Judge Darrah under a malign influence, destroyed Corr's intellectual and
contract property rights.
In so doing, the named defendants are implying that such federal court
judgments, orders, and rulings are valid and res judicata (law jargon
for "rest in peace") when the named Pepsi defendants know full well they
obtained the same corruptly and fraudulently.
Among the types of damage claims Corr makes against the named Pepsi
fidefendants, in the State Court suit filed 2/15/05,im the Circuit Court of
Cook County, Illinois, Law Division, Case No. 2005 L 001785, are the
following:
That they engaged in Theft of His Records.
That they conducted corporate espionage against him; that they conducted
misappropriation of his Trade Secrets; that they engaged in interference
of his business activities; that they did these things for Unjust
Enrichment.
Updated details of the State Court suit will be
posted (after 2/21/5) www.corrvspepsi.com
Question:
Unknown to Robert J. Corr, have the details
of the corruption in the Pepsi case of Chicago Federal District Judge
John W. Darrah, also been sent to the SECRET COURT like in the Coca-Cola
matter?

Spy Media React To Suit Against Pepsi
February 23, 2005
How do the spy-riddled, oil-soaked monopoly
press react to suits against Big Business?
If they cover the story at all, the mouthpieces of the Anglo-American
Aristocracy tend to marginalize and heckle private persons bringing
accusations and bad news.
After all, the journalism schools of the
Establishment, the Ruling Class - whatever you call THEM - persistently
teach their obedient students that the only dependable statements come from
"official sources", such as "for sale Congressmen and Senators",
"Banker-Judges", bribe-taking heads of government agencies, and
blackmailable and/or criminally insane occupants of the White House. That
is, self-serving statements from the shills of governance, most often ruling
without the consent of those governed.
Carefully forgotten is the sorry history of America's fraudulent elections
for high office.
News from peons petitioning government tribunals for redress of grievances
are on their face suspect. Likewise to be quickly rejected are the
statements of activists and reformers addressing calls to action to their
fellow citizens.
So it was a typical happening when CBS Network's outlets in Chicago, WBBM-TV
and WBBM Radio, received a press release about a suit filed February 15,
2005, in the State Court in town.
It started out, Robert J. Corr, owner of a beverage firm, accused
Pepsi of using "corruptly begotten" court judgments, implicating a federal
judge in destroying Corr's trademark and contract rights as against Pepsico
et al. [Part 15 of this series.]
So a WBBM reporter, John J. Cody, suddenly knows exactly where to reach Mr.
Corr. The supposed reporter, an old-timer, apparently did not see fit to
consult the damage suit details just filed. No, the reporter wanted instead
to immediately tape sound bites of the accuser
In law jargon, the finger-pointer in a civil suit is called the plaintiff;
the accused, naturally, are labeled the defendants.
The reporter lures the plaintiff to be "off-guard", by stating,
"I am very interested in your suit. I will
be following the progress of the suit and will be taping sound bites of
you in the next few weeks".
So the pigeon, thus duped, is led to falsely
believe that the wonderful monopoly press is going to greatly publicize his
denunciations of Pepsico, several of their units, and their attorneys, named
defendants in a civil damage suit.
Claims against them as to using corrupt and
fraudulently begotten judgments, as to theft of records, misappropriation of
trade secrets, interference with business, corporate espionage, and other
matters.
The practices of CBS and their local major outlets are typical of Big
Brother. The liars and whores of the press have perfected their practices
over a period of decades.
Civil rights and anti-Viet Nam War activists were contacted by the network
outlets, as well as by the major print media. The targets, too often
completely blank on the history of the press and their practices, usually
think to themselves "Wow, I am going to be in the NEWS. I am going to be
heard!"
The pretended interviews, fully audio taped, filmed, in later years videoed,
would consist of eliciting personal data.
-
Do you represent yourself or do
you have a lawyer?
-
Where do you work?
-
What do your siblings and parents work
at?
-
Where were you educated?
-
Are your activities financed?
-
By whom?
-
Are you
sure you know what you are talking about in your damage suit?
-
Who are your
witnesses?
The product of such interviews seldom or never went on the air. Instead
couriers would deliver transcripts of the interviews to the FBI, or to an
unmarked office in Virginia of the American CIA. And delivered as well
quietly to the attorneys for the Big Business accused.
So that spy-agency paid agents provocateurs
could steer such activists into getting busted.
"Don't just sit idle there. Come on, let's
fire-bomb the Draft Board."
Or, that hired guns of Big Business could get a
head start in torpedoing the dissidents before they go much in Court.
(Briefly, I taught how to conduct investigations to naive students at a
broadcast school - very briefly, until the school bosses could not stomach
me further and ran me out. My teaching of how to finger bagmen and
corrupters and government-paid provocateurs was terminated. I found out that
nearby, in an unmarked office, were working the couriers of these
transcripts from the spy media.)
CBS's Chicago outlets are typical of what goes on and has gone on throughout
America.
In December, 1969, an elite team of CIA assassins, later falsely described
as simply local Chicago police, assassinated, in his bed while he was
asleep, Fred Hampton, head of the Illinois Black Panther Party with his wife
sleeping next to him shot through the stomach; she survived and gave birth
to Fred Hampton, Jr.; also murdered with Fred was an associate in the black
activist movement.
WBBM-TV, Channel 2 Chicago, aired an entirely fraudulent re-creation of the
event. They together with WBBM Radio knowingly falsely stated that the
police shot Hampton because he was firing weapons at them.
The media whores censored the fact that the
murder team arrived about 4 a.m. in the morning in a truck they borrowed
from the telephone company, accomplices to the assassination.
(As I later in 1970 showed with suppressed
documents in court, the leader of the murder team, was the same CIA-trained
operative within the Chicago police, Daniel Groth, who covered up aspects of
the aborted plot to assassinate President John F. Kennedy expected at a
football game, some two and a half weeks before Dallas.)
In 1987, right the day before Thanksgiving, Chicago's first black Mayor,
Harold Washington, was assassinated with a cup of coffee laced with a
near pure mixture of Cocaine causing a fatal heart seizure. (Bank collapses
and political assassinations are covered up, the best way either right
before or during a holiday.)
WBBM Radio reporters, knowing I tend to be reasonable, said they wanted me
for a one-hour live radio broadcast on my exclusive details of the murder of
the Mayor, circulated by me through a vast chain of phone lines hooked to my
sophisticated telephone message machinery.
The news-fakers kept repeating the death of the
Mayor was purely natural.
Among the motives I set forth for the murder of Mayor Harold Washington, a
few months after his re-election, are some of the following:
-
The City contract was soon to expire,
with the electricity monopoly, Commonwealth Edison. The Mayor (if he
lived) vowed to take over Edison's generating facilities within the
city limits; facilities already amortized and fully paid for.
Outside the city limits were Edison's
nuclear energy generating machinery, a large cost item. Under Mayor
Washington's plan, announced for his re-election, he would supply
municipal-owned electricity to Chicagoans for as little as ten
dollars per month per residence.
At the time, a major owner of Edison, according to U.S. government
reports, was the Pope, a faraway absentee owner and landlord as to
Chicago.
A member of our group petitioned the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
to forbid the Vatican from proceeding with its plans to build
further Nuclear plants in Illinois, already site of the most in the
nation. Federal law prohibits a foreign power, such as the Vatican,
from owning nuclear facilities in the U.S.
The Vatican-owned Edison arbitrarily cut off the
electricity to her home, as a reprisal. She won a damage suit
against the Vatican after sixteen local judges disqualified
themselves, some not even Catholics, but beholden to the Church
Hierarchy. ["Electric
Scandal".]
-
Mayor Washington announced he was going
to stop the exclusive city bond deals with the Rockefeller banks,
highly lucrative to them, and permit Japanese banks to bid on the
contracts.
So, with the murder of the Mayor and motives of
foul play covered up by WBBM and all the rest of the monopoly press, WBBM
proceeded with their plans as to me.
They promised me, that despite having heckled me, and spied on me in the
past through their interview tricks, that they would be fair to me. I
figured to myself I will take a chance and in a pinch, hollar back louder
than them.
They started the one-hour program live by describing me as being as phony as
a three dollar bill. I countered by rapidly listing their fraudulent
broadcasts and spying on peaceniks, and to cover up the CIA murder of Fred
Hampton.
Despite my accomplishments of the biggest judicial bribery scandal
in U.S. history touched off by me in 1969, and me causing a situation where
twenty judges and forty lawyers were sent to prison for bribery; despite
that, the WBBM hatchet-man announcer shouted at me that I was a known
long-time liar and idiot.
Among subjects absolutely censored by such media as outlets in Chicago and
elsewhere of ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, and CNN, to name just some of them, are the
following:
-
non-governmental person's accusations,
in and out of court, of bribery and corruption of Federal Judges,
state and federal officials, and against Big Business such as the
Oil Cartel.
-
private persons making accusations, in
and out of court or governmental tribunals, against members of High
Society and puppets of the Ruling Class.
-
at a time of fake war hysteria and
domestic violence orchestrated by the Aristocracy themselves as
"foreign terrorism", for the purposes of canceling the U.S.
Constitution and Bill of Rights; censored are the statements of
private persons as to the war party in the District of Criminals.
The long-time dirty practices of the mass media
aired to conduct pretended "interviews" to dupe accusers into divulging
possibly negative personal data which can make its way to the accused Big
Shots and their attorneys, as well as to Big Brother's spy shop.
A large number of the supposed reporters in the American monopoly press were
or continue to be with Military Intelligence, and/or the American CIA, and
other lesser known aspects of the espionage community. That is quite true of
the Chicago Tribune, its print and website versions, as well as their more
than fifty units, print, radio, and TV of their Presslord Empire.
Likewise engaging in these rotten practices of pretended "interviews" to
extract background data to feed to Big Business and their hired guns, big
law firms, are those, for example of the financial press, such as the Wall
Street Journal and Business Week, just to name a few.
In the Pepsi litigation, it seems evident that WBBM presumed they have a
sucker or dupe on the hook, and will grill him, extract from him data as if
taking his "deposition", without the safeguards of court rules. And then,
mysteriously such transcripts and tapes may find their way to Pepsi's law
devils, well-paid mercenaries of Darkness.
In a second talk with long-time WBBM reporter John J. Cody [(312)
951-3810, jjcody@cbs.com], Corr with including me in a conference call,
asked Cody if he is going to do more sound bites. Cody said the matter is
too complicated. Corr asked for the tapes to be turned over to him (implying
so as to keep them out of the hands of third parties, such as Pepsi and
their attorneys). Cody said they were "gone" and Cody would not say where.
I asked Cody about their media practices, such as censoring stories pointing
the finger at Big Business.
[In his many years in the monopoly press, Cody,
like other mass media reporters, is presumably familiar with the practice of
"grilling" private persons as dissidents and accusers of Big Business, not
to put on the air but to spy on them. Perhaps Cody stopped the apparent plan
of "grilling" Corr because perhaps Cody found out that Skolnick, who fingers
media spies, was involved investigating the matter of Pepsi.].
One of the dirty secrets of the monopoly press is that various units, print,
TV, radio are adjuncts for what has become the American Gestapo,
namely Homeland Security and counter-intelligence of the FBI
including but not limited to
WBBM Radio and TV in Chicago, the Chicago
Tribune, and the Washington Post as well as other mass media outlets
nationwide.
