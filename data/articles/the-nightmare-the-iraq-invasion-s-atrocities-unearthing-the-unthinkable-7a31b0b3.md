"Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities."
Fran√ßois-Marie Arouet
"Voltaire"
(1694-1778)
I have a deeply held belief that the duty of a commentator is, to the best
of one's ability, to record, to shine light in often dark places, to act as
a voice for those whose own voice, fears, plights might not be heard or
known.
To write about the emotions one sometimes feels when doing it, is an
anathema and anyway a redundancy.
The purpose is to attempt to draw
attention to wrongs, not to whine about the effects they can have - and any
way, a private life should be just that. If politicians wish to strip
themselves of their dignity and allude to everything from their sex life, to
using private grief to gain sympathy votes, those with a shred of
self-respect do not wish to emulate them.
Here, I am breaking my taboo, for
a reason.
Over the last several weeks I have again researched in depth, invasion's
atrocities in Iraq, unearthing the unthinkable, switching off emotion and
reading of terror, torture, monstrous wickednesses, word after sickening
word. Then, Fallujah revisited (1) with document after document revealing
the depth of the darkest depravities towards others, which can be plumbed,
by "some mother's son" - or daughter.
Indeed, some child's father or mother,
able to shoot the children, toddlers, babies of others, in cold blood, drive
over them in tanks, leaving the pathetic remains to be eaten by stray dogs.
Photographs viewed have included many which even hardened investigators have
deemed:
"too disturbing to view."
This is not a view I hold.
If family
members who have survived, emergency workers (when not incinerated by U.S.,
troops themselves) medical staff, (if not shot, imprisoned, tortured, or tied
up with a bag over their head) can view, identify, bury with love and
respect - or in the case of medical staff, carefully photograph, and note
time, location of finding, then number, wrap and retain for a period, before
burial, hoping a relative will claim the charred, mutilated, or worse,
remains.
It is a duty for those with any "voice", from countries responsible
for this first documentable U.S., U.K., genocide of the 21st century, to
draw attention to it, in the memory of and in tribute to, the voiceless,
nameless, uncounted victims, in the hope that eventually, legal recourse
might result.
In fact it was compassion which over came all - bodies and faces burned near
beyond recognition, or the eviscerated, the all with the eyes, often, still
staring out in a desperate silent plea for help, combined with utter
bewilderment.
"We have the scumbags on the run", wrote a marine on his
website. "We lit them up", wrote another, as many took photographs of these
lost souls - and sent them to porn sites in exchange for free viewing.
And
between the U.S., occupiers (now, surreally, re-branded "advisors" - same
car, new paint) and what Hussein al-Alak of the Iraq Solidarity Campaign has
called:
"the U.S., imposed Vichy government, with their foreign passports...", who will fight for justice for the Iraqis?
And, as since 1991, this is also a war against the unborn, new born and
under fives.
After the bodies and the rubble, the gore, blood and limbs,
there are the deformities. The fledgling life, born without eyes, brain,
with one cyclops eye, with no head, with two heads, with no limbs, or
fingers - or too many.
A biblical land turned to genetic and ecological
Armageddon, for current and future generations, till the end of time.
"Mission accomplished", said
George W. Bush, in his ridiculous little flying
suit, on the USS Abraham Lincoln on 1st May 2003. "Let freedom reign", he
scribbled, after the first, corrupt, murderous, corpse-littered "elections".
Result: "Let genocide commence."
The U.S., appointed "Viceroy" in Iraq,
J. Paul Bremer, dressed for the part,
Hollywood style, in ridiculous desert, or army boots, depending on your
perception, arrived shortly after the invasion, seemingly believing in
population reduction. Reportedly asking what the population of Iraq was, he
was told, about twenty five million.
His response was allegedly :
"Too many,
try five."
But then, he had been
Kissinger Associates' man.
As I read, I listened to the great and the good in various world legal
bodies discuss whether the Congo and Rwanda should be "classed" as genocide.
In July 2004, as U.S., troops were training for the Fallujah massacre, the
coming November, the U.S., House of Representatives passed a unanimous
resolution calling the tragedy of Darfur: "Genocide."
They asked the
administration to consider "Multilateral or even Unilateral" action, to end
this genocide. Reluctance to take proactive steps to prevent further loss of
human life was "criminal", they opined.
Seemingly genocides these days are only committed by Africans or Eastern
Europeans, not those great bastions of 'democracy,' U.S., U.K., and the "only
democracy in the Middle East", ally Israel.
The Israeli Defense Force,
trained U.S., troops for the two week November 2004, Fallujah pogrom. (2)
"If it moves, shoot it", was the order of the day.
As two world wars, as
Korea, Vietnam, the face of liberation never changes.
"Their tactics basically involve massive fire power... bringing in tanks
and helicopters to fire on targets... demolishing buildings, establishing
snipers on roofs, smashing holes in walls (and) shooting anything that
moved."
This in addition to:
"...aerial bombardment and shell fire from
large field guns."
The plight of Fallujah:
"Was not fully understood in the
West, save by some of the survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto... they were
trapped (like) rabbits in a cornfield", being circled to be mown down and
dismembered by combine harvesters.(3)
The photographs are testimony to the
chilling description.
The unsung heroes are those who determined to record
them, so some time, some where, the crimes would be known and legal
retribution sought. These terrible, pathetic images, are the silent
testimony to the first known Western genocide of the 21st century. Sadly, it
is a near certainty that Iraq and Afghanistan will, in time, produce proof
of more.
On visits to Iraq during the embargo years, when there was the silent
genocide over nearly thirteen years of the U.S.-U.K. - driven U.N.,
embargo's prohibition of all necessary to sustain the basics of life, with
children dying of "embargo-related causes", at an average of six thousand a
month, witnessing the heartbreak, the bafflement at their plight, the
terrible guilt was always leaving.
One saw and shared to some extent, the
unimaginable, being perpetrated in one's name, then one left. Across the
border, in Jordan, the lights were on, the towns bustled, clean water came
out of the taps, and the illegal American and British bombs were not
dropping.
Yet so near, the children were dying, the people were dying, in
the name of "We the people ..."
Looking through the photographs, reading of the near incomprehensible depths
of sadistic destruction of their fellow human beings, men and women in
uniform can uniformly sink to, I could also escape at the end of the day. I
could make a meal, go and listen to live jazz at a favorite jazz pub, or
simply pour a glass of wine and listen to music, surrounded by numerous
books, collected pictures and loved items, in a home I enjoy, before seeking
the warmth of the duvet and a comfortable bed.
But if the conscious mind can switch off, clearly the sub-conscious does
not. One night the nightmare, one was sure was not a nightmare, but reality,
struck. In the surreal world of nightmares, I "woke", to find myself
saturated, blood pouring from under my arms.
Wondering what was happening
and what to do about it, I did, in nightmare-land, what I often do when
working something out (though not usually at 3 a.m.) and got the tools
together and went out in to my garden.
As ever, to trim and nurture plants,
and bushes, mostly grown from tiny, often quarter inch cuttings, cosseted
indoors, until clement weather, then planted outside, in sheltered warmth,
and further fed and tended until suddenly seemingly overnight, a vibrant,
colored addition, standing on its own roots, is ready to face all seasons.
But my garden, with its protective hedges, (white flowers in summer, orange
berries in winter and thorns to deter the trespasser...) had gone. There
were just bulldozer tracks, deep, ruining, not a leaf, stem or bloom left -
just a wasteland.
Then, in nightmare-world, in my nightclothes, blood covered, I realized I
had no keys to get back in.
What if anyone found me in this state? I turned
to the front door to try and figure a plan - but the building had gone. I
was alone, bloody, near undressed and all had vanished, turning back to
other familiar buildings, suddenly there was nothing. Just ruin, rubble and
wasteland, as far as the eye could see. My life, my books, my comfort zone,
were no more. Just the bloodied clothes I stood in remained.
Like walking away, I, of course, woke up - soaked and shivering.
To a hot
bath, a washing machine and a warm airing cupboard full of clean bed linen -
my garden still intact. The people of Iraq, with their destroyed homes and
gardens, fruit groves, date palm groves, or their vibrant plantings on
balconies or flat roofs; the Palestinians, suffering the same plight for
sixty two interminable years, and the people of Afghanistan in their
flattened compounds, destroyed with their scented groves and gardens of
blossoms and apricots, live a nightmare from which they never awake.
I thought again of the Iraqi child, whose parents had a beautiful garden,
who showed a friend and I her drawing book, before the invasion.
One picture
had an abundance of flowers, carefully colored, in numerous hues, on the
side were American soldiers - shooting at the flowers.
"Why are the soldiers
shooting the flowers?" We asked.
"Because Americans hate flowers", she
replied solemnly.
It was a deeply saddening moment, that she represented so
many children, who saw American as representing only wrath, fear and
deprivation.
She knew nothing of those Americans who had worked tirelessly
to reverse the situation. If she has survived, she will be a young adult.
She is unlikely to have changed her views.
In the U.K., Scottish parliamentarian, Dr Bill Wilson (4) is ploughing a
determined path to
bring Tony Blair to justice.
In furtherance of this, he
has now written to Scottish First Minister, Alex Salmond and Cabinet
Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill, calling for Scotland to adopt the
recently agreed international definition of the crime of aggression into its
legislature.
His letter reads:
"The International Criminal Courts Review Conference of the Rome Statute in
Kampala (5) earlier this year adopted a resolution by which it amended the
Statute so as to include a definition of the crime of aggression and the
conditions under which the Court could exercise jurisdiction with respect to
the crime.
The actual exercise of jurisdiction is subject to a decision to
be taken after 1 January 2017 by the same majority of States Parties as is
required for the adoption of an amendment to the Statute. However, I believe
that there is now no legal obstacle to individual countries adopting the new
definition of the crime of aggression into their own legislatures.
I hope
you will agree with me that it would be to Scotlands credit if we could be
one of the first countries to do this, and it would be a fine legacy for the
present Scottish Government to leave as it nears the end of its term."
He commented that, further, since the The International Criminal Court
(ICC) has
now agreed on a definition of the crime of aggression:
"I believe that
although the ICC itself cannot prosecute on the basis of this for the time
being, there is no impediment to individual countries adopting the
definition into their own legislatures immediately.
If Scotland did so, it
would be an excellent example to the rest of the world and would send the
clear message that we respect international law here. It would also create a
powerful incentive for present and future UK Governments to think carefully
before embarking on warfare.
I think most Scots would not wish to see a repeat of the tragedy we have
seen unfold in Iraq. This might be a way of preventing such misguided
ventures in the future.
Dr Wilson, is adamant:
Scotland is in a position
to: "...lead ethically in adopting the crime of aggression definition", and
has legal advise which concurs.
Dr Wilson plans to use Fallujah as an
example of this aggression, but also points out there there are surely
numerous others, undocumented, as yet.
As John Pilger reminds, Blair promised that the (illegal) invasion of
Baghdad would be,
"...without a bloodbath and that Iraqis in the end would
be celebrating... In fact, the criminal conquest of Iraq smashed a society,
killing up to a million people, driving four million from their homes,
contaminating cities such as Fallujah with cancer-causing poisons and
leaving a majority of young children malnourished in a country once
described by
Unicef as a 'model.' "
New Statesman, 30th September, 2010
As Pakistan, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, now seem to be in would be imperial
sights, a precedent which will flag a up a warning sign to leaders of ill
intent, is surely needed.
Dr Gideon Polya, who's work on excess deaths from
invasions since 1950, states, in Afghanistan:
"The annual death rate is 7%
for under-5 year old Occupied Afghan infants, as compared to 4% for Poles in
Nazi-occupied Poland, and 5% for French Jews in Nazi-occupied France."
The U.S., and U.K., whose leaders have trumpeted the dangers of the latest
"new Hitler" in the countries they planned to decimate, have outdone the
Nazis.
Enough.
