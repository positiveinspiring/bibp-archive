With attention being drawn to the contradictions
and outright lies by the US government surrounding
the events of 9/11 (as
well as renewed interest in previous false flag events such as the attack on
the USS Liberty meant to draw the US into Israels dirty wars) it may very
well be that the powers-that-be have decided the event ushering in the next
phase of war against Israels enemies will come from be a high-level
assassination involving democratic candidate for president Barack Obama.
As FDR himself once quipped,
If something happens in politics, you can be
rest assured it was no accident.
Therefore, persons wise to the ways of the
world can assume the recent spate of news stories pairing the idea of
assassination with the name Barack Obama cannot be mere coincidence.
Nor should the fact that out of all the individuals the powers-that-be could
have chosen as a candidate for President that the one they settled on was a
black man with a distinctly Muslim name.
The outcome of such an event is as obvious as it is frightening.
The first
black candidate for president from one of Americas two major parties being
gunned down by Islamic terrorists tied to Iran (who will no doubt be
aligned with white nationalist/neo-Nazi types) would result in an American
public howling for war against Iran, to say nothing of the civil unrest that
would erupt in Americas cities as well as a virtual police state being
inaugurated.
As far as the evidence itself indicating that such plans are afoot, one need
look no further than some of the stories coming out of the mainstream news
these days. Beginning with Hillary Clinton herself who, when asked why she
was not dropping out of the race for the democratic nomination remarked on
the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968 by Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian
terrorist said to be angry with RFK because of his support for Israel.
What she was intimating in her comments was that an Obama assassination was
enough of a possibility that she still had a chance of winning and had
decided therefore to stay put.
Next there are certain carefully-placed news stories and Op-Ed columns to
consider. In a New York Times piece arch-Neocon and slavish, slobbering
supporter for Israel Edward Luttwak directs the collective American
attention towards a future Obama assassination in a piece entitled
President Apostate where he points out that under Islamic law, Obamas
Muslim father means that Obama himself is also a Muslim, and that willful
conversion to Christianity would be deemed apostasy, the penalty for which
is death, usually by beheading.
Of the dozens of Islamic countries Luttwak
could have mentioned, he lists only two where such a death sentence might be
issued Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Given the fact that Saudi Arabia is a puppet
of the US and Israel and is not on the axis-of-evil list like Iran, any
lone nut assassin would therefore by implication come from Iran, the same
nation from which the infamous death sentence against anti-Islamic writer Salman Rushdie was proclaimed for his book The Satanic Verses.
More recently there is the spate of stage-prop news stories portending the
presidential candidates possible upcoming date with the grim reaper. In
early June, a story detailing the arrest of a man outside Obamas hotel
entitled Fear for Obamas Safety After Knife Arrest features one
Davit Zakaryan arrested by Secret Service agents when found with an 8-inch knife
in his possession.
Of particular interest is the mans name (and more
importantly the last part of it Aryan) as Zionist groups such as the ADL
(Anti-Defamation
League)
and their tentacles throughout the mainstream news media are now trying (as
they did with the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma city)
to establish a link between Muslim Extremists and right wing/white
nationalist/domestic terrorist types.
Relevant to this are the stories
appearing in mainstream news recently detailing the testimony of Mike
McConnell, director of National Intelligence claiming Al Qaeda is busy
recruiting white Europeans into its ranks for attacks on the US, and more
importantly, just prior to the elections.
The possibility of collusion at the highest levels with such a conspiracy is
not helped out by other events taking place recently. A story appearing in
the Dallas Star Telegram entitled Police concerned about order to stop
weapons screening at Obama rally reveals that Obamas Secret Service detail
decided to stop screening people for weapons an hour before he was to appear
at a large rally in Dallas and how that citys police chief questioned the
wisdom of such a decision.
The obvious relevance of the word assassination
being paired with the city of Dallas and John F Kennedy obviously adds even
more intrigue to the issue.
And, last but not least, there is the most recent event taking place at the
time of the Democratic convention in Colorado, where 3 men were arrested
with high-power rifles and other pieces of equipment in what police said was
a plot to kill Obama. The men, one whose last name was surprise,
surprise Adolph admitted to planning to kill Obama at his acceptance
speech and were tied with surprise surprise again white nationalist/neo-Nazi
groups.
The other obvious advantage to such a scenario taking place for the Neocons
is that it would allow them to clean house within the US
defense/intelligence establishments. Intimating (or outright stating) that
the assassination was helped along by elements within the highest echelons
of Americas defense and intelligence establishments would give
JINSA the
pretext for the witch hunt she has wanted to conduct for some time now.
With
this in hand, those persons, and particularly those of considerable
influence who have up to this point hindered the attack on Iran, would be
removed, giving Israel a clear, open road to do whatever she wants.
Those who doubt that Israel and her traitorous dual-loyalty surrogates
working at the highest levels of the US government would be willing to carry
out such an act need to think twice, and particularly against the backdrop
of history. As investigative reporter Michael Collins Piper aptly proved in
his book
Final Judgment, it was Israels Mossad who had the greatest reason,
motive and opportunity to kill not only John F Kennedy, but also his brother
Robert and his son JFK junior.
Besides this there is the testimony of
Margaret Truman, daughter of president Harry S. Truman who wrote that
Zionist assassins tried to kill her father through the US postal service.
As
recent as 2003, Israel announced officially that she would resume (as if
she ever truly refrained from) assassinations on the soil of allies (which
includes the US) in the interest of fighting terror, and given the fact
that the Jewish state sees the US being involved in fighting her wars, this
obviously means anything done on the furtherance of this policy is
justifiable.
More important though are the words coming right out of the
horses mouth, in this case ex-Israeli intelligence officer Victor Ostrovsky
in his book The Other Side of Deception who had the following to say
concerning Israels planned assassination of George H.W. Bush at the
Madrid Peace Talks in 1991:
Since the Mossad had all the security arrangements in hand, it would
not be
a problem bringing the killers as close as they wanted to President Bush and
then staging his assassination. In the ensuing confusion, the Mossad people
would kill the perpetrators, scoring yet another victory for the Mossad.
With the assassins dead, it would be difficult to discover where the
security breach had been, except that several countries involved in the
conference, such as Syria, were regarded as countries that assisted
terrorists.
To think the day would come in America when rational persons were justified
in considering the possibility that their own government working in
collusion with agents of another power would be willing to assassinate one
of the frontrunners for the office of president in order to start a war that
could destroy the nation seems surreal.
However, the sad fact is this: Such
questions being asked is not only justified, but warranted.
After all, lest
it be forgotten, it was the US government and in particular one Michael Chertoff, current head of
Homeland Security that after 9/11 sent back to the
Jewish state hundreds of
Israeli spies, some caught red-handed in
circumstances as incriminating as filming the towers coming down and
cheering.
And given these events, concerned Americans should keep a watchful eye on
what takes place in the coming weeks and months with respect to the health
and welfare of one Barack Hussein Obama, calling to mind the motto of
Israels Mossad,
By way of deception, thou shalt do war.
