Part I
Dividing the Middle East and North Africa
February 10, 2008
The Middle East and North
Africa are in the process of being divided into spheres of
influence between the European Union and the United States.
Essentially the division of the Middle East and North Africa are
between Franco-German and Anglo-American interests. There is a
unified stance within NATO in regards to this re-division.
While on the surface Iraq falls within the Anglo-American orbit,
the Eastern Mediterranean and its gas resources have been set to
fall into the Franco-German orbit. In fact the Mediterranean
region as a whole, from Morocco and gas-rich Algeria to the
Levant is coveted by Franco-German interests, but there is more
to this complex picture than meets the eye.
Unknown to the global public, several milestone decisions have
been made to end Franco-German and Anglo-American squabbling
that will ultimately call for joint management of the spoils of
war. Franco-German and Anglo-American interests are converging
into one. The reality of the situation is that the area ranging
from Mauritania to the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan will be
shared by America, Britain, France, Germany, and their allies.
These spheres of influence are really spheres of responsibility
in a long campaign to restructure the Middle East and North
Africa. The services agreement between Total S.A. and Chevron to
jointly develop Iraqi energy reserves, NATO agreements in the
Persian Gulf, and the establishment of a permanent French
military base in the U.A.E. are all results of these objectives.
Militant globalization and force is at work from Iraq and
Lebanon to the Maghreb.
Redrawing European Security
Borders
The Road to Redrawing the Map of the Middle East
The politics [foreign policy] of a
state are in its geography.
-Napoleon Bonaparte I
Emperor of the French, King of Italy,
Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine, and Mediator of the
Helvetic (Swiss) Confederation
Before NATOs Riga Summit it was agreed upon
that the western periphery of the Arc of Instability would be manned by
NATO and fall under Franco-German responsibility. [1]
Signs of the consensus reached between the
Anglo-American and Franco-German sides had emerged through Franco-German
representatives a month prior to NATOs conference in Riga, Latvia.
While lecturing at Princeton University in
October 2006, Joschka Fischer the former German Foreign Affairs Minister, a
member of the Green Party of Germany, and a representative of the
Franco-German entente gave a profound revelation about the direction of the
foreign, security, and defence policy that Germany and France were heading
towards.
The direction according to Joschka Fischer was eastward, with both the
Middle East and its Eastern Mediterranean waters being named as the new
borders of Europe. This region would be part of the new security sphere of
the E.U. and Europe. The former German minister stated that the terrorist
bombings in London, Britain and Madrid, Spain showed that the Middle East
is truly our [Europes] backyard, and we in the E.U. must cease our
shortsightedness and recognize that. [2]
Furthermore, Joschka Fischer warned that Europe needed to shift its
attention to the Middle East and Turkey - a member of NATO and one of the
gateways or entrances into the Middle East. It is not coincidental that
The New York Times also argued for the expansion of NATO into the Middle
East just months after the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq in 2003. [3]
By 2004 and through the joint Anglo-American and
Franco-German coordination in Lebanon it was clear that France and Germany
had agreed to be Americas bridgeheads in Eurasia. This is what brought
about the leadership of Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy in Berlin and
Paris.
The statements of Joschka Fischer reflected a broader attitude within the
leading circles of France and Germany. They are not coincidental remarks or
innovative in nature or isolated statements. They are part of long-standing
objectives and policies that have existed for decades.
Fischers lecture foreshadowed the drive towards
the harmonization of foreign policy in the Middle East between France,
Germany, Britain, and the United States. What Joschka Fischer said marked
the rapprochement of the Franco-German entente and the Anglo-American
alliance and foreshadowed the greater role the E.U. and NATO would play in
U.S. foreign policy.
The Daily Princetonian, Princetons school/university newspaper, quoted the
former German official as making the following statements: [4]
-
Europes security is no longer defined
on its [Europes] eastern borders, but in the Eastern Mediterranean
and the Middle East
-
Turkey should be a security pillar for
the European community, and the efforts to derail that relationship
are impossibly shortsighted
Joschka Fischers statements also foreshadow
Nicolas Sarkozys public campaign in the Mediterranean region.
Franco-German policy is also exposed in regards
to Turkey; before Nicolas Sarkozy was elected in France, Chancellor Angela
Merkel intensified her calls for the inclusion of Turkey within the
framework of the E.U. through a special relationship, but not as part of
the actual European bloc. [5]
This also foreshadowed what Nicolas
Sarkozy would later propose to the Turks.
This could mean one of two things: Franco-German policy is part of a
continuum regardless of leadership and party politics or that the outcome of
the 2007 French presidential elections were known in Berlin or decided
beforehand. Whatever the case, the German statements expose a calculated
agenda in Paris, Berlin, and other European circles for expansion linked to
the Anglo-American march to war.
Paris and Berlin act in tandem regardless as to whosoever is leading their
respective governments. It is Franco-German policy at its core depends on
powerful economic interests. The latter call the shots and override the
elected politicians.
These economic interests determine in both
France and Germany, as well as at the level of the E.U., the nature of
government policy.
The Mediterranean
Union
Expanding the E.U. into the Middle East and North Africa
The whole Mediterranean is slated to eventually fall within the European
Unions sphere of influence. This initiative is being spearheaded by France
and was officially kicked off by Nicolas Sarkozy on a tour of the
Mediterranean that started in Algeria. [6]
The idea of a Mediterranean Union was presented to Europeans with the
election of Nicolas Sarkozy, but this idea is not as new as the mainstream
media presents it.
Zbigniew Brzezinski acknowledged in 1997 that,
France not only seeks a central political
role in a unified Europe but also sees itself as the nucleus of a
Mediterranean-North African cluster of states that share common
concerns. [7]
An extension of the E.U. sphere of influence
will also result in an extension of Anglo-American influence and the
economic diktats of the Washington Consensus. In this case the question is
how much Anglo-American influence will there be within the Mediterranean
Union?
The E.U. is a shared body which support both Anglo-American and
Franco-German interests. It is through Americas special relationship with
Britain and NATO that America has a foothold in the European Union. However,
the E.U. is still predominately managed by Paris and Berlin. Thus, the
Mediterranean littoral will be brought largely under Franco-German influence
when the E.U. model is fused onto the Mediterranean.
The mechanism and structure established by the extension of the E.U. in the
Mediterranean will determine the level of Anglo-American influence within
the Mediterranean littoral. If the E.U. creates an overlapping mechanism in
the Mediterranean where the nations of the Mediterranean littoral are linked
only directly with E.U. members bordering the Mediterranean and indirectly
with other E.U. members, then Anglo-American influence will be much weaker
than it would be in the case of full integration between the E.U. and
Mediterranean.
This type of relationship would greatly empower
Paris and Berlin within the Mediterranean.
Hypothetically, this arrangement could exclude Britain, as well as America.
The Mediterranean could strictly fall into the Franco-German orbit, but this
seems to be an unlikely scenario. Anglo-American control and influence will
be maximized if the Mediterranean is wholly amalgamated into the European
Union.
However, this could damage the E.U. and hurt
Anglo-American and Franco-German interests for different reasons, including
demographics, if it is not done at a proper pace. If amalgamation is not
achieved gradually, the E.U. could face internal instability. In reality, it
is in the interests of the Anglo-American and Franco-German sides to share
the Mediterranean.
This is another case where cooperation with the Franco-German entente, is in
the interest of both and Britain and America. To insure a strong
Anglo-American role, NATO has been involved, and Israel has been integrated
into the framework for a Mediterranean Union.
Israels role in this process also hinges upon its bilateral relationship
with Turkey.
The role of Turkey as a Mediterranean country is considered pivotal in the
creation of a union in the Mediterranean region, as one of its backbones.
What has been created is an extensive network of relationships and links
that will make the whole structure of a Mediterranean Union easy and quick
to formalize.
The far-reaching economic and military ties
between Turkey and Israel will ensure that Israel is well integrated into
the proposed Mediterranean entity.
Dual membership for Turkey within the E.U. and the Mediterranean Union, but
without full E.U. benefits, would also benefit Anglo-American interests.
This may explain why Britain and America publicly support the direct entry
of Turkey into the European Union.
The roles of Turkey and Israel in the
Mediterranean are also topics that must be touched upon to themselves.
Establishing a
Mediterranean Free Trade Zone
...and Sharing the Spoils of Libyas Oil Wealth
Both the Franco-German and Anglo-American sides are sharing the spoils in
Libya, one of the targets of threats of war through the Global War on
Terror.
After the fall of Baghdad in 2003, Libya
surrendered peacefully to demands from the Western Powers. The Washington
Consensus made its breakthrough into Libya.
Tripoli was on a blacklist of nations, which included Somalia, Sudan,
Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Iran. It was also in 2003 that construction of the
Greenstream Pipeline was made to supply the E.U. with Libyan natural gas via
a route running through the Mediterranean Sea to the Italian island of
Sicily.
It seems just like yesterday when Libya was categorized as a rogue state
and vilified as a supporter of international terrorism. Its status changed
almost overnight with the opening up of its markets. A countrys economic
policy is what determines its status in the eyes of Washington and London.
There have been no political or ideological changes in Libya nor has there
been any change in leadership, but Libya is no longer seen as a rogue state.
The only thing that has changes is that Libya has flung its doors open to
U.S. and E.U. economic interests.
The economic, energy, and weapons deals signed with Libya in 2007 reveal the
ultimate economic intent of the Global War on Terror. Moreover, Libya has
committed itself to a program of national reform. [8]
The media has picked up on this, but fails to
talk about the real shape of reform in Libya.
The reforms are being presented as merely democratic reform. In practice,
Libya has also accepted to undertake a free market program of economic
restructuring in accordance with the demands of the U.S., Britain, France,
and Germany. Additionally, Colonel Qaddafi the ruler and Libyas authority
can not be challenged, which exposes the true cosmetic face of these
so-called democratic reforms.
Moreover, the Barcelona Declaration of 1995 that calls for a
Euro-Mediterranean Partnership stands in the backdrop of the neo-liberal
economic reforms, which will open up the Libyan economy to foreign
investors.
The Barcelona Declaration was intended to establish a European dominated
free trade zone in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean
region by 2010. Everything is on track, in regards to the objectives of the
Barcelona Declaration. The U.S. Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA) is also
a parallel to this.
The E.U.s Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA),
an aggressive free trade agreement being imposed under economic threats on
former European colonies, also has similar templates in regards to the ACP
States in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific.
Justifying ties to
Libya
The Bulgarian Nurses and a Shameless E.U. Public
Relations Campaign
It is no accident that a group of Bulgarian nurses were freed by Libya in
connection with the visit of President Sarkozy while he was on a
Mediterranean tour to talk about the establishment of the Mediterranean
Union. [9]
The whole event was an E.U. public relations
stunt. Nicolas Sarkozy arrived in Libya on July 25, 2007 to sign five major
deals with Libya just one day after his former wife, Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz,
shuttled out of Tripoli on board a French presidential jet with the five
Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor that France and the E.U. had
negotiated for.
The Bulgarian nurse ordeal has been used as a justification for improving
economic ties with Libya, a nation otherwise demonized as an international
rogue, despite the E.U. claims of commercial relationships being tied to
human rights. The whole affair was stage managed and was an attempt to hide
the underlying economic interests that dictate foreign policy in the E.U.
and America.
At the time, it was also reported that Libya
blackmailed the E.U. for economic benefits in regards to the freedom of the
Bulgarian nurses. However, in reality it is the E.U. that benefiting from
the economic arrangements with Libya and not the other way around.
The mainstream press in the E.U. attempted to make it look like President
Sarkozy was acting on his own in regards to Libya and started calling him a
maverick, but nothing could be further from the truth.
The French government claimed that their
business deals with Libya were part of an effort to bring Libya into the
light of respectability and that human right issues were also discussed
between the French President and Colonel Qaddafi. However, Colonel Qaddafi
stated at UNESCO Headquarters, in Paris, that human rights were never even
talked about between the French President and himself. [10]
This was during a highly reported five-day state
visit made by Colonel Qaddafi to France where the Libyan leader was welcomed
by President Sarkozy on December 10, 2007. [11]
The freedom of the Bulgarian nurses also came after major Anglo-American
arms and energy deals were announced with Libya. [12]
Both Anglo-American and Franco-German economic
interests were being served in Libya. In May of 2007, in a state of irony,
the British prime minister at the time, Tony Blair, announced a major
Anglo-American arms and energy deal while visiting Libya and Colonel
Qaddafi. [13]
The French, with the knowledge and support of
their German partners, also announced an arms deal between the European
Aeronautics and Defence Space Company (EADS) and Libya. [14]
France also announced a major nuclear deal with
Libya. France, like Britain and the U.S., has coddled Libya in pursuit of
economic interests and this should dispel for once and for all the mirage
that the U.S. and the E.U. are defenders of democracy and human rights.
In a related event Colonel Qaddafi has also told African leaders that if
plans for an African Union were delayed that Libya would divert billions of
dollars worth of investments from the African continent to the Mediterranean
region and become its most influential player. [15]
Pertaining to the Mediterranean Union Qaddafi
also stated that the fates of Libya and North Africa are tied to Europe.
[16]
Exposing Paris and
Berlin at their game
Germanys role in the Mediterranean Union
It has been reported in the mainstream media that the weapons and nuclear
agreements between France and Libya have upset Berlin, but German officials
have denied this as untrue. [17]
Chancellor Angela Merkel has also claimed
that Frances idea of a Mediterranean Union threatens the E.U. and its
institutions. German leaders are playing a game of on-and-off-again
opposition to Paris in regards to Libya and the Mediterranean Union. Berlin
makes critical statements of French actions, but then denies them to create
a shroud of confusion.
Media reports and Berlins statements are utterly false and intended to
deliberately mislead the public. Germany had to approve the French deals
with Libya, because EADS is a Franco-German company that has both private
and governmental interests and representation from both Paris and Berlin.
The contracts with Libya could never have been formalized without the okay
of the German government.
Germany is fully involved in the creation of the Mediterranean Union, as are
America and Britain. The hypocrisy of the whole act that is being played out
in Paris, Berlin, and E.U. capital cities is part of a tactic to mislead the
public opinion.
In Britain, The Financial Times called attention
to the fact that Angela Merkel really wants Germany and the E.U. to be fully
involved in the creation of the Mediterranean Union:
Angela Merkel, Germanys chancellor,
pointedly told Frances ruling UMP [Union pour un Mouvement Populaire/Union
for a Popular Movement] party yesterday that the future stability of the
Mediterranean region affected the whole European Union and that all 27 [E.U.]
member states should be involved in the engagement process. [18]
The context of the German Chancellors speech
was for the creation of something going beyond the Barcelona Process of
1995, which she called too bureaucratic, that would fully include all E.U.
members.
Frau Merkel emphasized that the Mediterranean
was vital for Germany and northern E.U. members and not just France and
Mediterranean E.U. members like Spain and Italy:
Germany wants to assume its
responsibilities in the Mediterranean and we want to offer to all [E.U.]
member countries the possibility to participate, she said. We should
have a reinforced co-operation [between the E.U. and Mediterranean]. I
am convinced that all European countries are interested in this.
[19]
In her speech, Frau Merkel stated that she was
convinced that all E.U. members would be interested in having roles in the
creation of the Mediterranean Union, but this is an untruthful statement -
Frau Merkel knows that the entire E.U. was slated from the start to be a
part of the process.
The issue is not about interest, but about a calculated
long-term arrangement.
Nicolas Sarkozy has moved forward with the staged act of presenting a
compromise by saying that Germany and any other non-Mediterranean E.U.
members (e.g. Britain) that want to participate in the creation of the
Mediterranean Union are welcome. This is all a complete act. This is part of
the commencement of publicly making the Mediterranean Union into what it
already was, which is an E.U. initiative.
It should also be noted that German representatives were also in West Africa
in connection to the French initiatives in the Mediterranean region.
[20]
The Germans are also preparing for the road
ahead when the Mediterranean Union would economically link Africa to Europe
and set the stage for further expansionism.
E.U. Declarations of
support for the Mediterranean Union
The Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, has also
announced Spains support for the creation of a Mediterranean Union and for
new migration laws during a meeting with Nicolas Sarkozy. [21]
Although it is not being tied to the creation of
the Mediterranean Union, the rationale for a drive to establish new
migration laws is precisely because of the Mediterranean Union and the
influx of migrants that could arrive into the E.U. from the poorer countries
of the Mediterranean.
Italy has also signaled its support for the
Mediterranean Union and new migration laws in the E.U. during the same
meetings between Prime Minister Zapatero and President Sarkozy, which
involved Prime Minister Prodi. [22]
All the Mediterranean members of the E.U., also called the Olive Group,
have also declared their support for the creation of a Mediterranean Union
at a two-day conference (January 17-18, 2008) held in Paphos, Cyprus.
[23]
The Cypriot Foreign Minister, Eros Kazakou-Marcoullis told the international press that the Mediterranean
members of the E.U. fully back the creation of a Mediterranean Union:
We reaffirmed our support to all efforts
which have as an objective the strengthening of the cooperation between
European and Mediterranean countries and reiterated the importance of
the Mediterranean region for the security, stability and prosperity of
the European Union. [24]
The Annapolis Conference and the Arab-Israeli
Conflict were also discussed in Paphos because of their deep relevance to
the integration of the Arab World and Israel with the European Union. A
forced agreement on the Arabs would pave the way for the political and
economical restructuring of the Arab World.
Without mentioning it directly, the
Mediterranean Union has also been inferred to as a solution to the issue of
unifying Greek and Turkish Cypriots by Gerhard Schröder (Schroeder), the
former federal chancellor of Germany. [25]

Part II
NATOs Role in Conquering the Middle East and
North Africa
February 18, 2008
In the first
portion of this text, the longstanding plans for creating a
Mediterranean Union, which predate Nicolas Sarkozy by many
years, were revealed as were U.S. and E.U. efforts to turn the
Middle East and North Africa into free trade zones and economic
territories. The implementation of this project was planned
through the 1995 Barcelona Process and the U.S. Middle East Free
Trade Area (MEFTA).
Franco-German plans for extending the borders of the European
Union in synchronization with the Global War on Terror were
also discussed. The case of Libya was also discussed to expose
the hypocrisy behind the economic agendas of the E.U. and U.S.
that hide behind humanitarian causes and human rights. Finally
the earlier portion of this text also confirmed the roles of
Germany and the European Union as a whole in establishing the
Mediterranean Union.
NATO Expansion in the
Mediterranean
Paving the Way for E.U. Enlargement
France and Germany are partners in the Anglo-American wars and the Project
for the New Middle East.
This is not a recent development, this is the
resumption of the strategic understanding that existed between the
Franco-German and Anglo-American sides before the Bush Jr. Administration
seemed to have diverged from Anglo-American geo-strategy.
The global
military deployments of Germany, France, Spain, and Italy coincide with
statements of expanding the European Unions security borders, which can in
turn be equated to expanding the European Unions sphere of influence.
In 2004 and 2007 E.U. expansion followed the NATO expansion of the 1990s
eastward in the European continent. This pattern sets a methodological
precedent that should be acknowledged with some value. This same NATO-E.U.
template of expansion is also being applied in the Middle East and North
Africa.
This modus operandi of military-political
expansion is also noted by Bzezinski:
In July [1997] Poland, the Czech Republic,
and Hungary were officially invited to join NATO. Invitations to the
Baltic [Republics; Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia], Romania, and
Bulgaria soon followed. This expansion made Europes own expansion
logical and unavoidable.
With the former European Community having
redefined itself as the European Union, Europeans themselves decided
that it made no sense to exclude their newly democratic [neighbors] -
already tied through NATO to both the United States and the European
Union - from actual [European Union] membership. [1]
However Brzezinskis casual rationalization of
NATO and E.U. expansion and his bumbling effort to casually link them as if
it all was an unplanned accident that presented a sensible response is
false.
If this was true then why has, hereto in 2008,
Turkey been denied E.U. membership since the creation of the European Union?
The answer is that NATO and E.U. expansion were pre-planned objectives in
Eastern Europe.
The Franco-German and Anglo-American agenda in the Mediterranean explains
several other international developments and realities. Firstly, the
objective of forming a bloc in the Mediterranean explain the earlier
expansion of NATO in the area through what NATO terms the Mediterranean
Dialogue.
This so-called Mediterranean Dialogue is part of
NATOs Mediterranean Initiative.
The framework of this relationship creates a de
facto extension of NATO, which includes Israel as an informal member.
Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, Tunisia, Egypt, the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan, and Israel are all members of NATOs Mediterranean Initiative. The
only Arab nations in the Mediterranean littoral that are excluded are Libya,
Syria, and Lebanon.
Through this mechanism the Mediterranean Sea has
virtually become a NATO lake, almost surrounded entirely by NATO members or
de facto NATO members. Albania and the coastline of the former Yugoslavia
off the shore of the Adriatic Sea are also controlled by NATO.
Secondly, the German naval and French land commands over NATO troops on
Lebanese soil and off the Lebanese shore are explained by the categorizing
of the Mediterranean as an area under Franco-German management.
It should also be noted that it was in 2001 that
the E.U., particularly the French, started talking about sending troops
under the banner of NATO into the Eastern Mediterranean, in particular
Palestine.
Israel to join the E.U.
and NATO
The exclusion of Syria and Lebanon from NATOs Mediterranean network can be
used to explain the next point.
Syria is the last Arab state in the Middle East
that is independent in its policy making. Both Syria and Lebanon are slated
to fall under the authority of Franco-German interests and the political
sphere of the European Union. This is what the Israeli war against Lebanon
in 2006 sought to partially accomplish.
The post-mortem facts of the 2006 Israeli aerial siege against Lebanon show
that Syria was also an intended Israeli target. However, Israel was unable
to attack Syria and hesitated because of its failures in Lebanon and Iranian
threats to intervene militarily if Israel attacked Syria.
Strategic planners within the U.S., Israel, the E.U., and NATO have also
formulated several contingency plans to partition Syria and Lebanon under
several alternative arrangements and maps. This is part of the broader
objective to control the coastline of the Eastern Mediterranean as well as
both the Middle East and North Africa.
As
NATO solidifies, its military presence in the western outer periphery of
the Arc of Instability, the governments of France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
and other E.U. members have also started close security dialogues with Tel
Aviv over Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iran. [2]
Israel not only has a relationship within a
multilateral framework with NATO, it also has strong bilateral ties with
Brussels that were deepened in 2004.
It is not by chance that Israel is a partner in Operation Active Endeavour,
the force that has spawned the NATO naval armada off the coasts of Syria and
Lebanon. [3]
Nor is it coincidental that Israel announced it
would fully participated in NATO naval exercises in May of 2006, right
before attacking Lebanon. [4] This was under the pretext of a
so-called Iranian threat.
Starting in August, 2007 Israeli ships have joined NATO warships in the
Eastern Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Black Sea in full naval cooperation.
[5] This has been marked by joint Israeli-NATO exercises that
have taken place in the Red Sea and the Black Sea.
It should be noted that minesweepers have participated in the inaugural
Israeli-NATO naval exercises. This alludes to possible action against Iran
in the Persian Gulf. Many establishment figures in Germany, including those
from the German Green Party, have also called for the inclusion of Israel
into NATO as a full member. [6]
According to Avigdor Lieberman, an important figure in Israeli politics,
Israels diplomatic and security
goal... must be clear: joining NATO and entering the European Union.
This is considered as the strategic path that
Israel must take. [7]
Israel is expected to eventually join the European Union.
The E.U.s enlargement is tied into the process
of NATO expansion. Israel and the E.U. will both manage, from an economic
and political standpoint, the western outer periphery of the Arc of
Instability under the framework of a Mediterranean Union.
Western Energy
Security, NATO, Israel, and the Bigger Picture
The Mediterranean Union is tied to energy security. It is a process
towards the economic domination of the Mediterranean by the European Union.
The balkanization of Lebanon and Syria serve the interests of Western energy
corporations, amongst a host of other interests. The envisioned redrawn
borders for the Middle East that are tied to the Mediterranean Union and the
Project for the New Middle East are designed to secure energy corridors,
pacify the regions population, and ultimately set the stage for the
economic colonization of the new weaker states.
Israeli security concerns through the Yinon Plan would be integrated into
the equation, but only because of the regional security role Tel Aviv serves
for the U.S. and the European Union.
This process of dividing and economically absorbing is similar to the
pattern imposed in the former Yugoslavia by the Franco-German entente and
the Anglo-American alliance through the E.U. and NATO.
Aside from neutralizing Iran and its allies in the Middle East, the main
themes of the Herzliya Conference of 2008 in Israel were Israeli-NATO and
Israeli-E.U. relations and integration. The latent role of Tel Aviv acting
as a guarantor of energy security for the European Union and NATO was also
an object of important discussions.
The February 2008 issue of Commentary Magazine, the official periodical of
the American Jewish Committee, has also proposed in an article by
Norman Podhoretz that Israel could launch a
devastating pre-emptive nuclear attack
against Iran (below video) and Israels Arab neighbors (including the countries of Arab
regimes allied to Israel and NATO like Egypt) and militarily occupy the oil
fields, refineries, and naval ports of the Persian Gulf countries to
establish energy security. [8]
The pieces of the grand strategy unfolding over the strategic map are
becoming clearer. Podhoretz asserts that Israel could liquidate large
populations in the Middle East (tens of millions) and that Israel could
virtually annex energy-rich areas in the Persian Gulf.
The substance of these diabolical statements
emanate from an American think-tank, the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS), which is closely linked to the formulation of
the U.S. foreign policy and military agenda in the Middle East.
These statements and notions from Norman Podhoretz and the Center for
Strategic and International Studies act as a window of insight into the
thoughts of the Anglo-American establishment and its European and Israeli
partners.
There is also a link between the concept that Israel could
militarily occupy the oil fields of the Persian Gulf and the 2008 Herzliya
Conferences discussions about Israel acting as an agent of E.U. and NATO
energy security.
The 2006 Riga Summit illustrates the full scope of the strategic objectives
of NATO in securing energy resources in the Middle East, North Africa, and
the former Soviet Union.
In 2006, during NATOs Riga Summit in Latvia, which
included Israel, energy security was also a major theme; energy security was
discussed to the point where it was pushed forward as an Article 5 (Mutual
Defense Clause) issue. [9]
If the case of Iraq were not enough, it is clear
that a real and dangerous intent exists within the U.S., the E.U., and
Israel to take control of the energy resources of other nations through
force.
The Divided
Political-Military Relations
...that exist in Europe are Replicated in the
Mediterranean
NATOs Mediterranean Dialogue, which began in 1994, and the 1995 Barcelona
Declaration are the mechanisms for creating a Mediterranean Union.
The Barcelona Declaration pertains to the economic aspects of this proposed
regional body and NATOs Mediterranean Dialogue represents the underlying
military framework. It was in 2007 under Nicolas Sarkozy that the political
framework was unveiled. It is obvious that this has been a calculated
endeavor that has been thought through in advance many years earlier without
the knowledge of the general public.
While NATO has already started the military integration of Israel, followed
by the nations of North Africa and Jordon, a relationship with the E.U.
serves to integrate these nations gradually through political association.
It should also be noted that military ties are easier to implement between
autocratic and supposedly democratic countries than political harmonization.
E.U. and American principles on human rights are
often used to challenge countries that do not conform to the economic tenets
of the New World Order. The hidden face of globalization is exposed through
the military-political brinkmanship, which invariably support an economic
objective.
In the Mediterranean, there exists a divided, but inter-linked, military and
political relationship. What is taking place is the replication of the same
military-political relationship that allowed America through NATO to exert
its influence in Europe.
Just like in the E.U., NATOs framework in the Mediterranean region ensures
that France and Germany do not monopolize the Mediterranean Union. [10]
Israel and Israeli influence will be projected into the Mediterranean to
exert additional leverage on behalf of America and Britain. The inclusion of
Israel is to guarantee Anglo-American influence. The joint Anglo-American
and Franco-German roles and interests in the Mediterranean also explains the
Anglo-American and Franco-German deals with Libya, which is an illustration
of their shared economic interests.
On top of all this, the placement of an American
military base in Vicenza, Italy is tied to securing Anglo-American interests
within the projected framework of a Mediterranean Union.
NATO and the Persian
Gulf
Rivalry with the Eurasian Heartland?
The divided European military-political relationship, which is being
replicated in the Mediterranean, can also be observed in the Persian Gulf
where NATO and NATO members have military and security agreements with Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states.
Moreover, the GCC is creating a common market
with a similar structure to the proposed bloc in the Mediterranean. The GCC
common market is also slated for gradual amalgamate with the E.U. and the
Mediterranean Union.
The E.U. has had a formal relationship with the GCC since 1988 and NATO
initiated ties starting with the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative in 2004.
However, the process that has been underway in the Mediterranean is being
fast-forwarded in the Persian Gulf. This could be because of a possible
threat from the rising strength of the players in the Eurasian Heartland.
Iran, Russia, and China are now engaging the GCC in economic as well
military affairs.
During a conference in Bahrain, Russias Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander
Saltanov called for the creation of a new collective security arrangment in
the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, which would include Iran and could
include Russia. [11]
According to Chinese reports, Saudi Arabia and
China have also had discussions on establishing military ties. [12]
The members of the GCC, which are all members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) aside from Oman, are clearly being
tempted to switch camps. Both Washington, D.C. and Brussels are concerned by
the overtures made to the GCC and the Arab World by Iran, Russia, and China.
The U.S. National Director of Intelligence,
Michael McConnell has even warned the U.S. Congress in an annual assessment
that Russia, China, and all of the members of OPEC, which includes Iran and
Venezuela, all represent growing financial threats to American supremacy.
[13]
Plans for establishing a petro-rubble system for energy payments have also
been the subject of numerous exchanges between Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan,
China, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). This project, if
realized, would challenge the financial centers of the U.S. and the European
Union.
NATO, E.U., and U.S. military forces are deployed over a vast area: from
West Africa, Central and East Africa to the Balkans, the Middle East,
Pakistan, Afghanistan, and a large portion of the Indian Ocean.
Brute force is being used as the muscle behind neo-liberal economic
policies. NATO is playing a major role in enforcing the establishment of the
Mediterranean Union and the creation of the New Middle East.
These objectives are part of the reality behind NATOs document Towards a
Grand Strategy for an Uncertain World. The NATO document also puts a concept
into the limelight that is being discussed by E.U. and U.S. officials: the
amalgamation of the military assets of the U.S., the E.U., and NATO into one
streamlined military body. [14]
It is clear that the primary function of the
military has been to aid economic objectives and the case is no different in
regards to NATOs role in the conquest of the Middle East, North Africa, and
beyond.

PART III
The Emergence of a New Order and the Battle for the Mediterranean
November 5, 2010
In PART I of this
study, the long-term plans for creating a Mediterranean
Union, which predate Nicolas Sarkozy by many years, were
revealed as were U.S. and E.U. efforts to turn the Middle
East and North Africa into free-trade zones and economic
territories. The implementation of what is now called the
Union of the Mediterranean was a project planned through
the 1995 Barcelona Process and the U.S. Middle East Free
Trade Area (MEFTA).
Also discussed were Franco-German plans for extending the
borders of the European Union in synchronization with the
Global War on Terror. The case of Libya was also discussed
to expose the economic agendas of the E.U. and America.
Finally the earlier portion of this text also confirmed the
roles of Germany and the European Union as a whole in
establishing the Mediterranean Union.
In PART II of the text, NATO expansion in the Mediterranean
Basin was discussed through NATOs Mediterranean Dialogue
and its Mediterranean Initiative as a means of paving the
way for E.U. expansion and control. The process follows the
same steps as NATO and E.U. expansion in Eastern Europe. The
projection for the inclusion of Israel in the E.U. and NATO
were also addressed, as well as the role of securing energy
resources and markets in the Middle East and North Africa.
The Barcelona Process and the Informal 1995
Declaration of a Mediterranean Union
On February 10, 2008 the E.U. Commissioner for
Information Society and Media, Viviane Reding reacted to skepticism
about the Mediterranean Union on Deutsche Welle Television (DW-TV).
Commissioner Reding was told by her interviewer
that skeptics in the E.U. fear that the Mediterranean Union will tear the
E.U. apart.
Reding, a Luxembourger, responded that the
Mediterranean Union was already put in place in 1995 through the Barcelona
Process and that at the time, in 2008, the entity was merely being
fine-tuned:
We already have a Mediterranean Union with
the [creation of the] Barcelona Process, where the E.U. formed a
solidarity treaty with the countries of the Southern Mediterranean. The
correct action [for the E.U.] is to build on that. [1]
The three main stated objectives of the
Barcelona Process or the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership that was established
in Spain are stated through the Barcelona Declaration:
-
The definition of a common area of peace
and stability through the reinforcement of political and security
dialogue.
-
The construction of a zone of shared
prosperity through an economic and financial partnership and the
gradual establishment of a free-trade area.
-
The rapprochement between peoples
through a social, cultural, and human partnership aimed at
encouraging understanding between cultures and exchanged between
civil societies.
These principles are clearly tied to the
creation of joint economic, political, and military-security spheres; the
same ties that parallel the principles behind the formation of the European
Union. Yet, the motives and agenda behind these principles are not as benign
as they are presented.
Actions speak louder than words. There is a
great deal more to the larger picture of this supranational project.
One should ask, if the objectives behind this process were benign,
-
Why all the secrecy and why the deceit?
-
Why the gradual brinkmanship of the
project over time?
-
Most importantly, why the use of
threats, such as in the cases of Libya and Syria?
-
Or military means, using violence and
murder, such as in the cases of the Palestinian Territories and
Lebanon, to bring about the materialization of the process?
The answer is simply that this process will
benefit a select few circles in both the E.U. and the Mediterranean region
and not the majority of citizens.
The Mediterranean Union, along with the system
of global governance that is being weaved into place, will bring about
inescapable poverty and under its framework economic class will go down a
road where it will virtually be fixed like a caste in the future.
Union of Inequity
Cheap Labour, Worker Immobility, Guest Workers, and the
Mediterranean Union
Even the so-called Democracy of Athens
and the Platonic Utopia were based on domestic and industrial
slavery.
-Sir Halford J. Mackinder
Democratic Ideals and Reality, 1919
The Mediterranean Union at its roots is not
designed as an equal partnership for all its future members. Nor is it about
serving the citizens of these countries. The citizens of Turkey, the
Balkans, and the Southern Mediterranean will be treated as second-class and
third-class citizens.
Under the current framework of the E.U. it is not in the European Unions
economic interests to admit Turkey as a full E.U. member. States like
Germany in the Western European half of the E.U. benefit from the cheap
migrant labour forces from Turkey that are called guest workers.
If Turkey were to become a full E.U. member
these Turkish workers and Turkey will gain equal rights that the E.U. does
not want to grant them. This would include the right of Turkish workers to
be treated in the same manner as nationals of the host countries in every
way, including having equal wage levels and being able to benefit from the
host nations public services.
This would also give Turks mobility rights in
the European Union: free movement, the right to look for other employers
(the right of choice), and the right to be accompanied by their families.
[2]
The same concept would apply to the Arab nations of the Southern
Mediterranean, like Egypt with its large work force. The E.U. has no
intention on granting these countries any equal status in a relationship of
peers. This is why there is a rush to change migration laws in the European
Union. The basis of a special relationship or special partnership is in
reality a subordinate position.
It should also be noted that the E.U. is not a union of fair treatment and
equity either: Eastern European members of the European Union, called the
European Union-Eight and the European Union-Eight plus Two are also
legally subordinated within the frameworks of the E.U. in regards to their
relationships with the original fifteen members of the E.U., the European
Union-Fifteen. [3]
E.U. prosperity is also for a few and gross
differences, which in many cases have been amplified, remain between Western
Europe and Eastern Europe.
Aside from securing energy supplies and natural resources, another design of
the Mediterranean Union is to harness the substantially large work forces in
the Southern Mediterranean, while reducing dependency on cheap-labour from
China and other Asian countries.
The Southern Mediterranean is also the near
abroad of the European Union and the establishment of a formal cheap-labour
market in the Southern Mediterranean that is deeply tied to the E.U. would
cut geographic distance, wait time, transportation costs, fuel consumption,
and dependence on China in regards to products manufactured by cheap-labour.
To a certain extent, Chinese leverage over the E.U. would also be dealt a
strategic blow. The E.U., like the U.S., is also looking for a means to
reduce its dependence on the Chinese before Beijing can be challenged any
further over global resources and raw materials.
The Mediterranean Union provides a partial
answer to this quest against China and other nations with substantially
large populations, such as India and Brazil.
Once dependence on the Chinese is reduced then
energy supplies to China can be challenged with greater effort and possibly
cut.
Preparations for
Amalgamation
Changing E.U. migratory laws in anticipation for the
Mediterranean Union?
The underlying economic motives for the Mediterranean Union are the reasons
why the E.U. is making a mad dash to change its migratory laws.
The new regulations and laws will touch
immigrants, emigrants, migrant workers, tourists, and other visitors.
Fingerprinting, scanning, and collecting information on anyone crossing into
or outside of the borders of the E.U. will become standard procedure. This
process is also linked to the European Security Strategy, which is an E.U.
replication of the strategic doctrine of post-September 11, 2001 America.
Also, the E.U. has announced that it plans on setting up an American-style
visa regime for qualified foreign workers seeking entrance into the bloc.
Along these lines an E.U. blue card that would be similar to the American
green card would be unveiled as a pass for special residency in the
European Union.
Biometric identity management security systems
are being upgraded and introduced within the European Union. One such system
is BioDev II, which uses fingerprinting technology linked to E.U. entrance
visas.
The system has been developed by Motorola and is
in us in,
...under the supervision of the executive
branch of the E.U., the European Commission.
The changes to migratory laws in the E.U. are being brought about as a means
to obstruct the free flow of migrant workers from the Southern Mediterranean
countries that are expected to gravitate towards the countries of the
Northern Mediterranean in search of better wages and jobs as soon as the
Mediterranean Union is formalized.
A neo-liberal paradigm of imparity is being
strengthened and reinforced within the Mediterranean Union between capital
and labour. Capital will be free to move within the Mediterranean with
little regulation, whereas labour forces and individuals from the South
Mediterranean will be restricted in their movements and rendered immobile.
E.U. border security and frontier control with non-E.U. countries in the
Balkans, North Africa, the Middle East, and the former U.S.S.R. have been
defined as major priorities for the European Union.
Foreigners, including
migrant or guest workers, will have to start routinely carrying identity
cards and documents on them. The European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR)
is being set up to monitor all E.U. border points using high resolution
satellites and unmanned aircraft for migrant movements.
Frontex, a border intelligence agency with its headquarters in Warsaw, the
Polish capital, has also been created by the E.U. to monitor all E.U.
borders and frontiers. The Warsaw-based agency became operational on October
3, 2005. Additional emphasis has been placed on Ceuta and Melilla as
frontier points, which include radar detection and sensory systems and an
entire network of cameras to monitor migrant movements into the European
Union.
Ceuta and Melilla are tiny Spanish territorial
positions in North Africa which Spain gained in 1912 as part of Spanish
Morocco and has since refused to return to Morocco.
Fortress Europe
...and
the Economic Motivations hiding behind a Global Security Agenda
The so-called reforms being brought about in the E.U. are conveniently
justified to combat three elements:
The dawning of the Mediterranean Union, in
league with the global terrorism scare, will however also bring about
greater control over E.U. citizens.
Despite the creation of the
Schengen Zone the
passengers that will travel between different E.U. states or those traveling
on domestic flights will also have to hand over a large amount of personal
information. In Britain this includes credit card numbers and cellular phone
numbers. [4]
The information will be stored for thirteen
years and could be used to profile any individual, including profiling their
purchases through credit card records and their private network of
relationships through a log of telephone contacts.
Biometrics has been undraped as a major cornerstone of the European Union.
Mandatory fingerprinting of all travelers has also been unveiled in 2008 by
the European Commission as a new procedure to be introduced throughout the
bloc. All visitors crossing E.U. borders will also be monitored. All
non-citizens, including those from countries like Canada which are allowed
to travel to the E.U. without visas, would be forced to submit biometric
data to gain entrance into or to even travel through the European Union.
On February 13, 2008 Brussels announced a scheme
to collect large amounts of personal information on every traveler entering
or departing the European Union. This figure could be up to about nineteen
pieces of personal information. [5]
In 2007 an agreement was also reached by the E.U.
and the U.S. to supply the U.S. Department of Homeland Security with
nineteen pieces of information about individuals traveling from the E.U. to
the United States. [6]
By mid-2009, all E.U. members declared they will issue passports with
electronically archived fingerprints. E.U. member states, like Germany, also
plan to start sharing fingerprint and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) data with
the U.S. government through an automated exchange system modeled on the
outlines of the European Unions 2005
Prüm (Pruem) Treaty. [7]
The Treaty of Prüm outlines the creation of a
massive fingerprint information and DNA date exchange bank in the E.U. that
has been nicknamed Big Brother Europe by its opponents inside the European
Parliament (Europarl).
The new E.U. security measures would also reduce the rights guaranteed by
U.N. agreements to asylum seekers trying to attain refugee status.
Individuals trying to escape state persecution in North Africa or the Middle
East for advocating greater freedom and for labour rights will now be put in
a dangerous situation.
The European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE)
has protested that the sweeping changes in the E.U. will make it more
difficult to stay within the E.U. for asylum seekers while their requests
are being reviewed.
The E.U. is tactilely helping crush dissent in
the Middle East and North Africa towards autocratic rulers and absolute
monarchs. A safe haven for opposition movements will be systematically
eliminated. In no uncertain terms it is clear that the E.U. is not seeking
to nurture freedom or democratic values, but is strengthening the
stranglehold of its autocratic allies that rule the Middle East and North
Africa.
The changes that are expected by the European Commission to be ingrained
within the E.U. between the years 2010 and 2015 are not about terrorism or
fighting crime, but about the control of wages, labour markets, and labour
supply. Behind the security and crime fighting agendas sits the real agenda
of controlling migratory movements of people and wages.
The control of labour forces - both domestic and
foreign - is the main purpose of the new migratory reforms in the European
Union.
Knowing this it is of little wonder that the
first joint summit of the Arab League and the E.U. held in Malta was the
scene of not only major free-trade talks, but also major talks on migration
control between the E.U. and the Arab World. According to Franco Frattini,
the E.U. Justice Commissioner, the prime motive for the new regulations and
laws is to control the flow of migrant workers into the European Union.
According to Commissioner Frattini more than
half the illegal immigrants entering the E.U. do so with valid documents,
but stay past the expiration date of their permits.
If one were to live in a city where the only form of employment was a coal
mine and there was no means to leave the city then one would have no choice
but to work at the coal mine. Control of labour movement is a cornerstone to
the socio-economic objectives of the U.S., the E.U., the World Bank, and a
league of associated international financial institutions (IFIs).
By rendering work forces immobile in any given
geographic locality the rights of employment choice and occupational
alternatives are removed and a new form of monopoly is established - a
forced acceptance of work on whole pools of individuals. Rising fuel prices
are also adding to the erosion of mobility rights.
The security agenda behind controlling movements is heavily tied to economic
objectives, as are the international disease scares like avian influenza
(bird flu) and the swine flue that lock up human movement.
Control of mobility in the oceans and
international waters of the world is also part of this objective. The
internationally illegal Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) was
initiated by the U.S. government, with the support of the E.U., in 2003 as
part of the Global
War on Terror.
The Proliferation Security Initiative is
presented as a means to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction (WMDs), however it can be applied to bring about a hold over
global maritime mobility. The strategy is a threat to international movement
on the high seas and maritime trade.
There is good reason why it is illegal under
international law and the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Industrial De-location
in the European Union
...and the Global Economic Crisis
This process of industrial de-location has already been underway in the E.U.
for years, under which industries have been relocated to Eastern Europe and
other global regions.
Under this neo-liberal paradigm jobs and
industries can gradually be removed from wealthier E.U. states to Southern
Mediterranean nations, where cheap and immobile labour forces will be
awaiting.
This relationship is analogous to the events that occurred in North America
during the 1990s when jobs and whole industrial sectors where relocated from
Canada and the U.S. to Mexico where cheap-labour forces were waiting. In
North America this process unfolded under the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) and resulted in a decline in living standards or the
quality of life.
Costs of living went up, wages experienced a
decline, and a gap emerged between costs of living and wages which started
to eat away at the middle class.
The global economic crisis is the ultimate form
of shock therapy for industrial de-location and reconfiguration.
The global economic crisis has helped advance
the industrial de-location that had started decades earlier. In these terms,
the global economic crisis is not about financial errors by the banking
sector, but about pushing industrial de-location and re-engineering the
socio-economic order of the globe under the guise of state austerity
measures.
Triggering a Decline
of Wages in both the E.U. and the Mediterranean
Challenging China and displacing Asian labour markets?
The wages of the cheap-labour market in China can also be further lowered by
opening a cheap-labour market in the European Unions near abroad.
This is part of the global race to the bottom
where regulatory standards in regards to labour wages are being increasingly
dismantled. This process in effect facilitates a state of cannibalism or
economic decomposition within the effected labour markets and ultimately
brings about a decline in living standards.
If major cheap-labour markets like the Chinese market start to lower their
wages to stay competitive with a reconfigured cheap-labour market controlled
by the E.U. that would emerge in the Southern Mediterranean, then this could
eventually result in much lower wages in other global labour markets.
Other labour markets would lower their wages as
part of an effort to keep their respective markets open or in neo-liberal
terms as a means of staying competitive. Ultimately the results would have
worldwide ramifications for lowering global wages that would also effect the
citizens of the E.U., Japan, and North America.
This is one aspect of the race to the bottom
and it is part of a cycle that fuels itself into a downward spiral.
With the backdrop of the global economic crises,
what is unwinding itself is a global leveling of wages.
Wage levels within the E.U. are progressively
experiencing a decline and being brought downwards. The labour laws
protecting the wages and standards of E.U. citizens are being de-railed too.
De-regulation and degeneration are the orders of the day. Before the race
to the bottom and these measures were justified by E.U. officials through
neo-liberal assertions that wages need to be lowered because of the need for
competitiveness.
Now austerity measures are being used as
justification for reform and exploitation, because of the convenience of the
global economic crisis.
Aside from exploitation of the work force and
surplus labour in the Southern Mediterranean the remaining national assets
in these countries, like in Eastern Europe after the end of the Cold War,
will be privatized further and privately owned.
This process will go hand-in-hand with the
gradual entrenchment of higher costs of living that will further marginalize
local populations to sell private property, private assets, or any other
means of income out of desperation - decisions that will lock them into a
neo-liberal induced state of poverty.
Expanding the European
Union
The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)
Even in an era of globalisation,
geography is still important.
-A Secure Europe in a Better
World: The European Security Strategy
December 12, 2003
The European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) is a
means to expanding the European Union or creating additional layers or
satellites to the E.U., like the Mediterranean Union.
The European Commission subtly elucidates on
these expansionist intentions when describing the ENP:
The European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) was
developed in 2004, with the objective of avoiding the emergence of new
dividing lines between the enlarged [European Union] and our neighbors
and instead strengthening the prosperity, stability and security of all
concerned. [8]
Special attention should be given to the
European Commissions stated objective of avoiding the emergence of new
dividing lines between the enlarged [European Union] and its neighbors in
the Balkans, the former U.S.S.R., the Middle East, and North Africa.
[9]
When removing fine lines, meaning borders (which
are not necessarily physical), of separation what is left but some form of
harmonization or assimilation?
The ENP also provides funding through so-called financial instruments such
as the European Neighborhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) for
macro-economic reforms and economic restructuring that includes the
privatization of the national economies of the countries participating in
the program.
After the 2006 Israeli war against Lebanon the
Lebanese government agreed through the European Union-Lebanon ENP Action
Plan and the European Neighborhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) to
accelerate the privatization of the Lebanese economy through international
assistance, which means through the directorship of the U.S. and the
European Union.
The ENPI are categorized into those ENPI
covering the East (Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union) and those
ENPI covering the South (the countries of the Mediterranean Basin,
specifically Israel and the Arab countries of North Africa and the Middle
East).
The process has resounding resemblances to World Bank and International
Monetary Fund (IMF) programs. The ENP funding has been administered to all
of the European Unions frontiers in Eastern Europe, the former U.S.S.R,
North Africa, and the Middle East through so-called democratization
programs, stabilization initiatives, and humanitarian programs that include
food aid. Recipients of ENP funding include Serbia, Ukraine, Moldava,
Albania, Georgia, and the Arab countries that border the Mediterranean Sea.
In the Balkans the Stabilization and Association
Process (SAP) has also been at work, which includes so-called stabilization
of national economies through action plans drawn by the E.U. involving
country reports. E.U. assistance and aid is tied to conditionalities that
are drawn up by the European Commission in Brussels, which include the
privatization of state infrastructure that is bought by British, French,
German, Dutch, Italian, and American companies amongst others.
In 2007 the executive arm of the E.U. also formed the Neighborhood
Investment Fund. The purpose of the Neighborhood Investment Fund, which will
be active until 2013, is to support international financial institution (IFI)
lending from such organizations as the World Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in ENP partner countries.
Amongst the Arab countries of the Mediterranean,
since 2002, the European Investment bank is also heavily involved in this
process under the mandate of the ENP and the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean
Investment and Partnership (FEMIP). This further cultivates the chains of

Betrayal on the
European Unions Frontiers
The Disloyal Establishments of the Mediterranean
The continuum of Franco-German policy cuts across the lines of political
parties and government administrations.
Nicolas Sarkozys remarks about Turkeys
future in regards to the E.U. are almost similar to those of members of the
federal administration of Gerhard Schröder (Schroeder) in Germany. The full
inclusion of Turkey in the E.U. is tentative in nature. France has
repeatedly said that Turkey will not be admitted into the E.U., but will
enjoy a special relationship with the European Union. [10]
The relationships that are planned for Turkey and the Arab states of the
Mediterranean Sea with the E.U. are essentially those of E.U. territories or
economic dependencies with secondary privileges. The Mediterranean Union is
destined to be a second-class periphery for the E.U. that will be
subservient in nature. Through such an arrangement the nations of the Middle
East and North Africa will be reduced to economic colonies.
At the same time Turkey is integrating itself with the economies of Lebanon,
Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, and Libya in various ways and through free-trade
agreements. Many analysts believe that this, along with Turkish agreements
with the Russian Federation, constitutes a shift in the Turkish position.
This shift appears as being one that is against Turkeys NATO allies and
Israel.
Tehran and Damascus also give the impression
that they believe that a regional bloc and common market is being
established by them in alliance with Ankara and with the Iranian-Syrian Awliyaa (Alliance) as its nucleus. Tehran is also moving closer to Georgia,
even though Tbilisi is a staunch ally of the E.U. and America.
Yet, what Turkey is doing is precisely what American geo-strategists have
outlined for decades to rein in Iran and Syria through economic integration.
For example,
Zbigniew Brzezinski has stated:
American long-range interests in Eurasia
would be better served by abandoning existing U.S. objections to closer
Turkish-Iranian economic cooperation, especially in the construction of
new pipelines, and also to the construction of other links between Iran,
[the Republic of] Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. [11]
In Lebanon, where the country is tittering
between the so-called West and the Iranian-Syrian Awliyaaa, social change is
being instituted through austerity measures tied to the national debt of
Lebanon.
Lebanon ranks as one of the most heavily
indebted countries on the planet. The Lebanese debt to foreign lenders has
been accumulated by what is the March 14 Alliance portion of the government
in Beirut and their predecessors. Control over natural gas fields off the
Lebanese coast, in the waters of the Eastern Mediterranean, could also be
traded off as a means of servicing the Lebanese national debt.
The debt being accumulated by Lebanon and the nations of the littoral of the
Mediterranean is a strategy to bypass popular sentiment through economical
means. At the end of the day making bread is an important factor for the
decisions of most people.
All around the Mediterranean social change is
being brought about through economic change.
The European Security
Strategy
An Anglo-American and Franco-German Compact for Eurasia
Looking beyond the diplomatic jargon and the noise it is clear that
expanding the borders of the European Union is the force behind the ENP.
The ENP tackles the directives of the European
Security Strategy, an E.U. document that was put together through Paris and
Berlin that emerged in Brussels on December 12, 2003 after a series of
meeting between the Anglo-American alliance and the Franco-German entente.
It was at this time on December 16, 2003 that President Jacques Chirac and
Chancellor Gerhard Schröder cancelled Iraqi financial debts to France and
Germany after making arrangements with Washington, D.C. and London.
This was the start of the rapprochement between
the Franco-German and Anglo-American sides that resulted in an agreement to
share the spoils of war in the Middle East and North Africa. The European
Security Strategy is a product of the Franco-German and Anglo-American
agreement to carve up the world into spheres of management.
Brzezinski has described the E.U. as the American bridgehead in Eurasia.
All signs seem to indicate that France and
Germany, as Anglo-American partners, have agreed to become the
Anglo-American bridgehead in Eurasia. The European Security Strategy is the
source for redefining the European Union security borders in concert with
both Franco-German and Anglo-American interests. E.U. expansion is fully
supported by America.
The E.U. security document in fact states:
The United States has played a critical
role in European integration and European security, in particular
through NATO. The end of the Cold War has left the United States in a
dominant position as a military actor. However, no single country is
able to tackle today's complex problems on its own. [12]
To add to this, the Anglo-American and
Franco-German sides have been in the process of merging as a means to end
their rivalry.
An example of this merger is the outcomes of the
2010 Anglo-French Defence and Security Cooperation Treaty.
Under the treaty
both Paris and London will,
-
share their aircraft carriers
-
pool their
military resources
-
have joint military forces
-
have closer arms industry
cooperation
-
have joint defense equipment projects
-
have joint military
facilities
-
have integrated nuclear weapons programs
-
jointly develop
nuclear submarines
-
assess cooperation on developing military satellites
-
jointly developing unmanned aerial
drones [13]
In the European Security Strategy emphases is placed on the central
importance of NATO as the embodiment of America and the E.U. and the
objective of establishing a rule-based international order through
international regional bodies such as the E.U., the U.N. Security Council,
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), MERCOSUR, and the
African Union. [14]
What is written about the Mediterranean is as follows:
The Mediterranean area generally continues
to undergo serious problems of economic stagnation, social unrest and
unresolved conflicts. The European Union's interests require a continued
engagement with Mediterranean partners, through more effective economic,
security and cultural cooperation in the framework of the Barcelona
Process. A broader engagement with the Arab World should also be
considered. [15]
What is meant is that a project in the
Mediterranean should be engaged as a broader engagement of the entire Arab
World in economic and socio-political terms, as referenced by the Barcelona
Process.
In no uncertain terms the E.U. security document goes on to declare the
global ambitions of the European Union:
As a union of 25 states with over 450
million producing over a quarter of the world's [gross national product]
(GNP), and with a wide range of instruments at its disposal, the
European Union is inevitably a global player. In the last decade
European forces have been deployed abroad to places as distant as
Afghanistan, East Timor, and the [Democratic Republic of the Congo].
[16]
The security document replicates Anglo-American
dogma, but in a very vague way. Even pre-emptively tackling threats abroad,
in what has come to be known by political scientists as the Bush Doctrine,
is also mentioned. [17]
Good governance for the countries to the
East of the European Union, which means the Balkans and the post-Soviet
space, and the countries in the Mediterranean is also mentioned in line with
what is ultimately an expansionist supranational economic project. [18]
The document ultimately calls for [h]igher
defense spending upgrading the military and aligning the E.U. and NATO in
what will one day amount to integration. [19]
The Mediterranean Union is merely a linking piece. This project is clearly
engaged in brinkmanship towards global integration and the streamlining of
supranational political, economic, and military organizations.
It is part of a compact between the elites of
America and the major European powers.
An Embryonic Order is
starting to emerge in the Mediterranean
The E.U. is moving beyond the Barcelona Process of 1995.
The signs are
appearing everywhere.
The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA)
was established after the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq on December 3,
2003.
The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is an institution that
has been sanctioned through the Barcelona Process. It is no coincidence that
this body was brought about in 2003 because the Mediterranean Union is
linked to the forced globalization that is being waged through the Global
War on Terror.
The E.U. Commissioner for Information Society and Media has also given
strong suggestions and foreshadowed what the E.U. intends to do in regards
to the Mediterranean Union.
Viviane Reding told Christian F. Trippe,
the head of Deutsche Welle's Brussels studio, during an interview that the
E.U. should look beyond the Mediterranean and further eastward (e.g., the
former U.S.S.R. and the non-Mediterranean areas of the Middle East like Iraq
and the Persian Gulf) for expansion:
But we shouldn't just look at the
Mediterranean. We also need to look to the east. We have many new
neighbors. And that's why it's so important to have
the right policies to engage with them. [20]
On November 22, 2007 the Parliamentary Assembly
of the Mediterranean (PAM) established its official headquarters in Spinola
Palace, which is located in the Maltese city of St. Julians. Malta is an
island-state and an E.U. member located in the centre of the Mediterranean
Sea. [21]
The roots of the Parliamentary Assembly of the
Mediterranean extend to an inter-parliamentary conference held in 1983 by
Cyprus, but it was in 2005 and through security discussions held in Amman,
Jordon that the green light was given for the establishment of the
Mediterranean body.
On January 22, 2008 Reuters, quoting E.U. External Relations Commissioner
Benita Ferrero-Waldner, reported that the E.U.,
wants to push ties with Morocco to a higher
level within a year, rewarding Rabat for progress in opening markets and
pressing economic and social reforms,
...and has elaborated that Morocco will take
part in a shared border security, policing, and legal system with the E.U.,
amongst other things. [22]
The Kingdom of Morocco had made a bid to join
the E.U. in 1986, but was rejected.
It should come as no surprise that two inter-linked conferences on
free-trade between the Arab World, the U.S., and the E.U. were made and held
consecutively. The first of the meetings was in Amman, Jordon (February
10-11, 2008) and discussed establishing the U.S. Middle East Free Trade Area
(MEFTA) by 2013.
The second was an Arab League-European Union
foreign ministers conference held in Malta (February 11-12, 2008) that
discuss political engagement between the E.U. and the Arab League along
the lines of the European Union Mediterranean Free Trade Area (EMFTA).
The U.S. MEFTA venture started in 2003, the same year as the Anglo-American
invasion of Iraq. Oman, Jordan, Bahrain, Israel, and Morocco already had
bilateral free-trade agreements with the United States. All the U.S. MEFTA
members are also member states of the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA),
which is the project of establishing an Arab common market.
Such a project to establish a common market and
customs union is not new amongst the Arabs. This Arab free-trade agreement,
however, was adopted in the Arab League Summit of Amman in 1998, with 17
Arab League members signing the pact, it is supervised and run by the Arab
Economic Council in the Arab League, but officially came into existence as
of January 1, 2005. [23]
GAFTA objectives that are notable are as follows
-
The formation of a bigger and more
homogenous market
-
Allowing foreign direct investment to
work with a homogenous market with standardized regulations
-
Increase economic inter-dependence
between the Arab states
According to the Gulf Daily News of Bahrain, the
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, Kent Patton, while
visiting the U.A.E., Kuwait, and Bahrain for free-trade talks has said that
the MEFTA will be put in place in the Middle East and North Africa by 2014:
There is a 2014 deadline for this but we
hope it could be achieved sooner. There are no official discussions on
but the process is very much in place. [24]
The MEFTA process is a step-by-step project,
similar to the step-by-step formation of the European Union.
In 2010, interestingly enough, the Arab League meet in the Libyan city of
Sirte and discussed establishing a Arab Neighborhood. [25] The proposed
Arab Neighborhood could also include the non-Arab states of Turkey,
Ethiopia, Chad, and Iran.
This took place while Iran, Turkey, and Syria were
talking about and taking steps to establish a common market and bloc in the
Middle East that would also include Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordon.
Annapolis and the
Economic Integration of Israel with the Arab World
Both the American-Arab and European Union-Arab League conferences,
respectively in Jordon and in Malta, discussed economical integration, trade
in the Mediterranean, and the Arab-Israeli Conflict.
Both conferences were also coordinated with one
another and planned during the end of 2007 in close proximity to the
Annapolis Conference. The reason that Annapolis is linked to the timing of
these two conferences is because the Annapolis Conference promoted the
Saudi-proposed Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 and the Agreement of Principles
between Mahmoud Abbas and Ehud Olmert, which both call for the economic
integration of Israel with the Arab World.
These proposals by Riyadh, Ehud Olmert, and
Mahmoud Abbas are part of the blue prints for establishing the fertile
grounds for the emergence of the Mediterranean Union.
Understanding the link between all these events and objectives and realizing
their age will allow one to also understand why The Washington Post
published a front-page article on February 9, 2003 that declared that both
Israeli and American policy had become perfectly aligned in the Middle East:
For the first time a U.S. administration
and a Likud [Israeli] government are pursuing nearly identical
policies. [26]
The wars against Iraq and Taliban-controlled
Afghanistan were about globalization under the helm of military might.
Wars of Integration -
from the Balkans to Iraq
In order to move forward with the Mediterranean Union and the restructuring
of the Middle East the people of the region must all be subdued so that the
New Middle East can be brought about.
Furthermore, this is why NATO/E.U.
troops and ships are in Lebanon and the Eastern Mediterranean.
This project is part of the emerging New World
Order that George H. W. Bush Sr. was talking about when Baathist Iraq was
defeated in 1991 and it is this new order that is beginning to lift up its
head into the limelight for the whole earth to see. This endeavor is also
the underlying reason for the Global War on Terror and why America and the
E.U. were partners from the start of the so-called long war.
According to Lieutenant-General James J. Lovelace, the force known as U.S.
Army Central (USARCENT/ARCENT) was establishing a permanent platform for
full spectrum operations in the twenty-seven countries that form the
boundaries of what use to be U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) in the Middle
East, Central Asia, East Africa, and Pakistan.[27]
This was before all the African states, except
for Egypt, that fell into the borders of CENTCOM were transferred to the
watch of U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM, USAFICOM).
Lieutenant-General Lovelaces acknowledgement about the operational
expansion of the capabilities of the U.S. Army in the Middle East, Central
Asia, East Africa, and Pakistan only confirms what many experts and analysts
predicted from the onslaught of the Global War on Terror in 2001:
the U.S.
intended to stay permanently in the Middle East and Central Asia under the
cloak of fighting terrorism.
Lieutenant-General Lovelace also confirmed that
the process was part of a worldwide transformation of the U.S. military with
the ability to conduct offensive, defensive, and stability operations.
Lieutenant-General Lovelace has moreover confirmed that the U.S. military
has set its mind on staying permanently in the Middle East and its
surrounding regions:
These commands now have a permanent
responsibility to this theater. Theyll have a permanent presence here.
The personnel will change; the commands will remain. [28]
This process became apparent when
Lieutenant-General Paul T. Mikolsdhrk relocated from ARCENT headquarters
from Fort McPherson, Georgia to Kuwait in the Persian Gulf in November 11,
2001.
The Stabilization and
Association Process (SAP)
Supranational Expansionism
The SAP is part of the modus operandi of the E.U. and U.S. for moving into
conflict zones.
Along with similar agreements and devices, the
SAP is a form of neo-colonialism and imperial expansion. Countries are
either smashed or eroded and then swallowed through incorporation into a
much larger entity.
The words conflict, post-conflict, and stabilization all go together. Where
war brings instability, the economic and political tutelage of the U.S. and
E.U. has been presented as bringing stability. Both are systematic steps of
the same formula. Stability operations is a vague word used to beautify
occupation, economic restructuring of nation-states under occupational
administrations similar to the ones in Iraq and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and
nation-building.
The Stabilization and Association Process (SAP) has been part of the
expansion formula of the European Union. It has been applied in the war-torn
republics of the former Yugoslavia. It has proceeded by encouraging SAP
candidates to quickly open up their economies, integrate themselves, and
eventually to enter the E.U. as members.
The process establishes a contractual
relationship between the E.U. and the SAP candidate nations, which imposes
legal obligations on the SAP candidate to open up its economy and to
privatize its state infrastructure. State loans and economic arrangements
are also made by the E.U. for the SAP candidate state, which further put it
under the economic control of the main E.U. powers.
Currently Croatia and the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) are SAP candidates.
A Grand Hoax
From the Mediterranean Union to the Union of the
Mediterranean
A public relations campaign trying to hide the long-standing objectives of
creating the Mediterranean Union as an additional layer to the European
Union, which itself is a piece of a much larger emerging polity, has been
underway.
Public deception has been at play.
The
Mediterranean Union is costumed neo-colonialism, economic imperialism, and
servitude. The supranational project is being orchestrated under the cover
of a patient decades-long public relations campaign.
Germany has been pretending to oppose the supposedly solitary French idea of
creating a Mediterranean Union. Chancellor Angela Merkel even claimed that
the project risked splitting the E.U. with Paris establishing a sphere of
influence in North Africa and the Middle East and Berlin a sphere of
influence in Eastern Europe.
A false compromise has been drawn between Paris
and Berlin where the whole project has become a project that will involve
Germany and the rest of the European Union.
The Mediterranean Unions name has been changed to the Union of the
Mediterranean (UfM) as part of an effort to give the impression that a
genuine compromise has been made over supposed concerns and oppositions
towards it; when in fact the compromise is false and there were no
disagreements between Paris and Berlin.
In an omission about the true nature of the
Mediterranean Union as a project of the entire E.U., President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters that,
I never had the idea of excluding any [E.U.]
states [from the Union of the Mediterranean]... I never regarded it as a
rival to the [European Union]. [29]
According to Ingrid Melander the Mediterranean
Union,
concept has shrunk from an international
forum grouping only states with a Mediterranean coastline and involving
nine new agencies and a bank, to a mere regular summit of [E.U.] and
[non-E.U.] Mediterranean countries with a joint presidency - which may
yet be dropped - and a small secretariat. [30]
After the so-called German objections, it was
also widely reported that Nicolas Sarkozy has given the assurance of the
French government to Chancellor Merkel and Germany that the Mediterranean
Union will be a project for the entire European Union.
Yet, on the opposite shores of the Mediterranean
Sea there were voices refuting this. Colonel Qaddafi, the leader of Libya,
expressed his opposition to the so-called diluted version of the
Mediterranean Union that Paris and Berlin agreed upon and demanded a full
union.
The Jamahiriya News Agency of Libya quoted
Colonel Qaddafi as saying:
The idea of true cooperation between the
countries located around one sea on the lines of President Sarkozys
initiative deserves support... [31]
Later Colonel Qaddafi would publicly make a
reversal, voicing his opposition to the Mediterranean Union. Qaddafi would
boycott a summit co-chaired by Egypt and France (the co-presidents nations
of the Union of the Mediterranean) in July, 2008. [32]
Before its official acceptance in 2008, the proposal for a Union of the
Mediterranean was presented as a joint Franco-German initiative to the rest
of the E.U. bloc. [33]
The Franco-German proposals, like many other
political documents, are deliberately vague. The French government
distributed a paper to other E.U. countries earlier in January of the same
year outlining joint initiatives in agriculture, energy, the environment,
migration, transport and ten other areas. Yet, none of this was mentioned in
the less than two-page Franco-German paper.
Paris and Berlin will chair the E.U. involvement
in the Mediterranean Union. [34] The Mediterranean Union will also be
managed by two directors or co-presidents, one from a non-E.U. Mediterranean
nation and the other from a E.U. member state.
In 2008, during an E.U. summit, held from March 13 to March 14, 2008, the
project was approved unanimous by the entire E.U. and was handed over to the
European Commission for implementation with no public consolations with E.U.
citizens. The project from its beginnings in 1995 as part of the Barcelona
Process was part of a united E.U. endeavor to control the Mediterranean.
Paris has pretended that it originally wanted
the project to only include the nations of the Mediterranean littoral as
members, while Berlin argued that the E.U. would be divided amongst its
northern and southern members because of the project.
From the outset the project was funded by the entire European Union as a
part of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. The whole project is based on
the foundations of establishing a free-tree zone between the E.U. and the
nations of the Mediterranean and the Arab World. There are clear indications
that Berlin and the E.U. are being untruthful about the whole process
including claims that Germany opposed French economic ties with Libya.
[35]
The E.U. has stage-managed the whole project by creating false opposition or
a counter-discourse within the E.U. to the Mediterranean Union.
Additionally, there is a deliberate attempt to downplay the whole process
and its ramifications.
The European Commission has claimed that the
process of trade between the E.U. and the Mediterranean has merely generated
substandard results because of the inefficient governments of the nations of
both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Southern Mediterranean.
Brussels and E.U. officials have also downplayed the Mediterranean Union as a
reinvigorated Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. The mainstream media and
journalists in the E.U. have merely repeated these claims verbatim.
Little is said, however, about the European
Unions geo-strategic aims of securing the vast natural resources and energy
reserves of North Africa and the Middle East.
The Role of
Corporations in the Union of the Mediterranean
An additional dimension to this deceit is the role of multinational
corporations.
In a stage-managed event, Berlin was presented
to the public as prevailing in demands not to allow further E.U. funds to be
allocated to the Barcelona Process and the Mediterranean Union. This has
actually opened the door for the corporate private sector, which is one of
the main forces behind the whole project. As part of the false compromise
France requested for approximately 14 billion euros from multinational
corporations. [36]
In fact on May 27, 2010 financial institutions and private investors were
invited to the Marseille Provence Chamber of Commerce and Industry to
discuss financing and investment in the Southern Mediterranean and Eastern
Mediterranean countries, specifically in the energy, water, transport, and
urban development sectors. [37]
The Secretary-General of the Union of the
Mediterranean, Ahmed Masadeh, was present.
Also present at the
meeting was the E.U. Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighborhood
Policy, tefan Füle, and the Vice-President of the European
Investment Bank, Philippe de Fontaine Vive. [38]
Since 2002, the European Investment Bank has also been involved in this as
part of the ENP through what are called Facility for Euro-Mediterranean
Investment and Partnership (FEMIP) programs.
These FEMIP programs are extended to Algeria,
the Palestinian Territories, Israel, Jordon, Lebanon, Syria, Morocco, and
Tunisia and encourage,
the opening-up of the economies of
Mediterranean partner countries. [3]
In the words of the European Investment bank,
this is done through focusing,
on two priority areas: support for the
private sector and creating an investment-friendly environment.
[40]
The globe will be divided into poor and rich.
People are not only being alienated and
estranged from the products of their labour, but they are on the path of
ultimately being alienated and estranged to the system of governance that
controls their lives through unaccountable supranational organizations. The
global economic crisis has resulted in an induced anomic state in Europe and
other regions, which provides the perfect order for re-organizing the social
and economic order.
In this aspect the Mediterranean Union is one
phase within a global roadmap towards re-institutionalizing feudalism under
a global elitist compact.
Yet,
all global elites will not be equal in this
compact.
From the Eurasian Heartland a challenge is rising from the elites
of the triple entente of Moscow, Tehran, and Beijing, who have watched
uneasily as the U.S. and E.U. inch closer in different ways towards their
domains.
