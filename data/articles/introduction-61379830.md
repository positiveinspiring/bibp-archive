Final warning
a history of the new world order
introduction
Since the Persian Gulf War, the term 'New World Order' has become well known.
However, there has never really been an explanation as to what the term actually meant, only that it represented a new spirit of cooperation among the nations of the world, in order to further the cause of peace. And peace is good, so therefore the New World Order is good and should be accepted.
Not so fast. Like the old saying, you can't tell a book by its cover, there is more here than meets the eye.
In regard to the term, William Safire wrote in the New York Times in February, 1991:
" it's Bush's baby, even if he shares its popularization with Gorbachev. Forget the Hitler 'new order' root; F.D.R. used the phrase earlier."
The term 'New World Order' was actually first used many years ago.
In an address delivered to the Union League of Philadelphia on November 27, 1915, Nicholas Murray Butler said:
"The old world order changed when this war-storm broke. The old international order passed away as suddenly, as unexpectedly, and as completely as if it had been wiped out by a gigantic flood, by a great tempest, or by a volcanic eruption. The old world order died with the setting of that day's sun and a new world order is being born while I speak, with birth pangs so terrible that it seems almost incredible that life could come out of such fearful suffering and such overwhelming sorrow."
"The old world order changed when this war-storm broke. The old international order passed away as suddenly, as unexpectedly, and as completely as if it had been wiped out by a gigantic flood, by a great tempest, or by a volcanic eruption.
The old world order died with the setting of that day's sun and a new world order is being born while I speak, with birth pangs so terrible that it seems almost incredible that life could come out of such fearful suffering and such overwhelming sorrow."
In a 1919 subscription letter for the magazine International Conciliation, M. C. Alexander, the Executive Secretary of the American Association for International Conciliation wrote:
"The peace conference has assembled. It will make the most momentous decisions in history, and upon these decisions will rest the stability of the new world order and the future peace of the world."
In August, 1927, Dr. Augustus O. Thomas, President of the World Federation of Education Associations said:
"If there are those who think we are to jump immediately into a new world order, actuated by complete understanding and brotherly love, they are doomed to disappointment. If we are ever to approach that time, it will be after patient and persistent effort of long duration. The present international situation of mistrust and fear can only be corrected by a formula of equal status, continuously applied, to every phase of international contacts, until the cobwebs of the old order are brushed out of the minds of the people of all lands."

Adolf Hitler said:
"National Socialism will use its own revolution for the establishing of a new world order."
In the 1932 book The New World Order, author F. S. Marvin said that the League of Nations was the first attempt at a New World Order, and said that "nationality must rank below the claims of mankind as a whole."
Edward VIII became King of England on January 20, 1936, but he was forced to abdicate the throne eleven months later, when he married a commoner.
He became the Duke of Windsor, and in July, 1940, became the governor of the Bahamas. He is on record as saying:
"Whatever happens, whatever the outcome, a new Order is going to come into the world... It will be buttressed with police power... When peace comes this time there is going to be a new Order of social justice. It cannot be another Versailles."
In a New York Times article in October, 1940, called "New World Order Pledged to Jews," comes the following excerpt:
"In the first public declaration on the Jewish question since the outbreak of the war, Arthur Greenwood, member without portfolio in the British War Cabinet, assured the Jews of the United States that when victory was achieved an effort would be made to found a new world order based on the ideals of 'justice and peace'."
The "Declaration of the Federation of the World," written by the Congress on World Federation, which was adopted by the Legislatures of some states, including North Carolina (1941), New Jersey (1942), and Pennsylvania (1943), said:
"If totalitarianism wins this conflict, the world will be ruled by tyrants, and individuals will be slaves. If democracy wins, the nations of the earth will be united in a commonwealth of free peoples; and individuals, wherever found, will be the sovereign units of the new world order."
From an article in a June, 1942 edition of the Philadelphia Inquirer:
"Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles tonight called for the early creation of an international organization of anti-Axis nations to control the world during the period between the armistice at the end of the present war and the setting up of a new world order on a permanent basis."
According to a February, 1962 New York Times article called "Rockefeller Bids Free Lands Unite: Calls at Harvard for Drive to Build New World Order," New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller told an audience at Harvard University:
"The United Nations has not been able - nor can it be able - to shape a new world order which events so compellingly demand (The new world order that will answer economic, military, and political problems) urgently requires, I believe, that the United States take the leadership among all the free peoples to make the underlying concepts and aspirations of national sovereignty truly meaningful through the federal approach."
The Associated Press reported that on July 26, 1968, Governor Rockefeller said in a speech to the International Platform Association at the Sheraton Park Hotel in New York, that,
"as President, he would work toward international creation of a New World Order."
Richard Nixon wrote in the October, 1967 issue of the Council on Foreign Relation's (CFR) journal Foreign Affairs:
"The developing coherence of Asian regional thinking is reflected in a disposition to consider problems and loyalties in regional terms, and to evolve regional approaches to development needs and to the evolution of a new world order."
In 1972, while in China, in a toast to Chinese Premier Chou En-lai, Nixon expressed,
"the hope that each of us has to build a new world order."
Richard Gardner, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations under Kennedy and Johnson, and a member of the Trilateral Commission, wrote in the April, 1974 issue of Foreign Affairs (pg. 558):
"In short, the 'house of world order' will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down. It will look like a great 'booming, buzzing confusion,' to use William James' famous description of reality, but an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old fashioned frontal assault."
Richard A. Falk, wrote in his article "Toward a New World Order: Modest Methods and Drastic Visions" (from the 1975 book On the Creation of a Just World Order):
"The existing order is breaking down at a very rapid rate, and the main uncertainty is whether mankind can exert a positive role in shaping a new world order or is doomed to await collapse in a passive posture. We believe a new world order will be born no later than early in the next century and that the death throes of the old and the birth pangs of the new will be a testing time for the human species."

We believe a new world order will be born no later than early in the next century and that the death throes of the old and the birth pangs of the new will be a testing time for the human species."
In 1975, 32 Senators and 92 Representatives in Congress signed "A Declaration of Interdependence" (written by the historian Henry Steele Commager) which said that,
"we must join with others to bring forth a new world order Narrow notions of national sovereignty must not be permitted to curtail that obligation."
Congresswoman Marjorie Holt, who refused to sign it, said:
"It calls for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations. It declares that our economy should be regulated by international authorities. It proposes that we enter a 'new world order' that would redistribute the wealth created by the American people."
In an October, 1975 speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Henry Kissinger said:
"My country's history, Mr. President, tells us that it is possible to fashion unity while cherishing diversity, that common action is possible despite the variety of races, interests, and beliefs we see here in this chamber. Progress and peace and justice are attainable. So we say to all peoples and governments: Let us fashion together a new world order."

During the 1976 Presidential campaign, Jimmy Carter said:
"We must replace balance of power politics with world order politics."
In a February 14, 1977 speech, Carter said:
"I want to assure you that the relations of the United States with the other countries and peoples of the world will be guided during my own Administration by our desire to shape a world order that is more responsive to human aspirations. The United States will meet its obligation to help create a stable, just, and peaceful world order."

The United States will meet its obligation to help create a stable, just, and peaceful world order."
Harvard professor Stanley Hoffman wrote in his book Primacy or World Order:
"What will have to take place is a gradual adaptation of the social, economic and political system of the United States to the imperatives of world order."
Conservative author George Weigel, director of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C. said:
"If the United States does not unashamedly lay down the rules of world order and enforce them... then there is little reason to think that peace, security, freedom or prosperity will be served."
In a December, 1988 speech, Mikhail Gorbachev told the United Nations: "Further global progress is now possible only through a quest for universal consensus in the movement towards a new world order."
The man who put the New World Order in the limelight, and did more than anyone to bring about its acceptance, was President George Bush.
In a February, 1990 fundraiser in San Francisco, Bush said:
"Time and again in this century, the political map of the world was transformed. And in each instance, a New World Order came about through the advent of a new tyrant or the outbreak of a bloody global war, or its end."
On Saturday, August 25, 1990, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to allow a joint military force to use whatever means necessary to enforce a UN blockade against the country of Iraq.
That afternoon, Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, a CFR member and former aide to Henry Kissinger, who was the National Security Advisor to Bush, was interviewed by Charles Bierbauer of the Cable News Network (CNN) and used the term "a New World Order."
In August, 1990, (According to an article in the Washington Post in May, 1991) he said:
"We believe we are creating the beginning of a New World Order coming out of the collapse of the U.S.-Soviet antagonisms."
During a September, 1990 speech at the United Nations, he announced that "we are moving to a New World Order."
Later, on the eve of the Gulf War, Scowcroft said:
"A colossal event is upon us, the birth of a New World Order." In the fall of 1990, on the way to Brussels, Belgium, Secretary of State James Baker said: "If we really believe that there's an opportunity here for a New World Order, and many of us believe that, we can't start out by appeasing aggression."

"If we really believe that there's an opportunity here for a New World Order, and many of us believe that, we can't start out by appeasing aggression."
In September, 1990, the Wall Street Journal quoted Rep. Richard Gephardt as saying:
"We can see beyond the present shadows of war in the Middle East to a New World Order where the strong work together to deter and stop aggression. This was precisely Franklin Roosevelt's and Winston Churchill's vision for peace for the post-war period."
In a September 11, 1990 televised address to a joint session of Congress, Bush said:
"A new partnership of nations has begun. We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective - a New World Order - can emerge... When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this New World Order, an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the United Nations' founders."

When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this New World Order, an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the United Nations' founders."
The September 17, 1990 issue of Time magazine said that,
"the Bush administration would like to make the United Nations a cornerstone of its plans to construct a New World Order."
In a September 25, 1990 address to the UN, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze described Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as "an act of terrorism (that) has been perpetrated against the emerging New World Order."
In an October 1, 1990, UN address, President Bush talked about the,
" collective strength of the world community expressed by the UN an historic movement towards a New World Order a new partnership of nations a time when humankind came into its own to bring about a revolution of the spirit and the mind and begin a journey into a new age."
On October 30, 1990, Bush suggested that the UN could help create "a New World Order and a long era of peace."
Jeanne Kirkpatrick, former U.S. Ambassador to the UN, said that one of the purposes for the Desert Storm operation, was to show to the world how a "reinvigorated United Nations could serve as a global policeman in the New World Order."
On December 31, 1990, Gorbachev said that the New World Order would be ushered in by the Gulf War.
Prior to the Gulf War, on January 29, 1991, Bush told the nation in his State of the Union address:
"What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea - a New World Order, where diverse nations are drawn together in a common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind; peace and security, freedom, and the rule of law. Such is a world worthy of our struggle, and worthy of our children's future."
He also said:
"If we do not follow the dictates of our inner moral compass and stand up for human life, then his lawlessness will threaten the peace and democracy of the emerging New World Order we now see, this long dreamedof vision we've all worked toward for so long."
In a speech to the families of servicemen at Fort Gordon, Georgia on February 1, 1991, Bush said:
"When we win, and we will, we will have taught a dangerous dictator, and any tyrant tempted to follow in his footsteps, that the United States has a new credibility and that what we say goes, and that there is no place for lawless aggression in the Persian Gulf and in this New World Order that we seek to create."
Following a February 6, 1991 speech to the Economic Club of New York City, Bush answered a reporter's question about what the New World Order was, by saying:
"Now, my vision of a New World Order foresees a United Nations with a revitalized peace-keeping function."
Bush said in a speech to the Congress on March 6, 1991:
"Now, we can see a new world coming into view. A world in which there is a very real prospect of a New World Order. In the words of Winston Churchill, a 'world order' in which the 'principles of justice and fair play... protect the weak against the strong.' A world where the United Nations, freed from cold war stalemate, is poised to fulfill the historic vision of its founders. A world in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations."

On August 21, 1991, after the failed coup in the Soviet Union, CNN reporter Mary Tillotson said that the President's "New World Order is back on track, now stronger than ever."
In an interview with CNN at the height of the Gulf War, Scowcroft said that he had doubts about the significance of Mid-East objectives regarding global policy.
When asked if that meant he didn't believe in the New World Order, he replied:
"Oh, I believe in it. But our definition, not theirs."
On January 25, 1993, Clinton's Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, said in a CNN interview: "We must get the New World Order on track and bring the UN into its correct role in regards to the United States."
In April, 1992, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. wrote the article "How I Learned to Love the New World Order" for The Wall Street Journal.
While campaigning for the passage of NAFTA, Kissinger said:
"NAFTA is a major stepping stone to the New World Order."
In a July 18, 1993 Los Angeles Times article about NAFTA, Kissinger is quoted as saying:
"What Congress will have before it is not a conventional trade agreement but the architecture of a new international system a first step toward a New World Order."
On May 4, 1994, Leslie Gelb, CFR President, said on "The Charlie Rose Show":
" you (Charlie Rose) had me on (before) to talk about the New World Order. I talk about it all the time. It's one world now. The Council (CFR) can find, nurture, and begin to put people in the kinds of jobs this country needs. And that's going to be one of the major enterprises of the Council under me."
On September 14, 1994, while speaking at the Business Council for the United Nations, David Rockefeller said:
"But this present window of opportunity, during which a truly peaceful and interdependent world order might be built, will not be open for long. Already there are powerful forces at work that threaten to destroy all of our hopes and efforts to erect an enduring structure of global interdependence."
"But this present window of opportunity, during which a truly peaceful and interdependent world order might be built, will not be open for long.
Already there are powerful forces at work that threaten to destroy all of our hopes and efforts to erect an enduring structure of global interdependence."
He said at another time:
"We are on the verge of a global transformation. All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order."
In the July/August 1995 issue of Foreign Affairs, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. wrote: "We are not going to achieve a New World Order without paying for it in blood as well as in words and money."
Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt said:
"The New World Order is a world that has supernational authority to regulate the world commerce and industry; an international organization that would control the production and consumption of oil; an international currency that would replace the dollar; a World Development Fund that would make funds available to free and Communist nations alike; and an international police force to enforce the edicts of the New World Order."
Somehow, the implications from these quotes, lends a sinister overtone to this New World Order.
After 25 years of research, it is clear to me that this country has been infiltrated by conspirators, members of an organization who are dedicated to establishing a one-world socialist government - with them in control.
It sounds unbelievable, like something out of a James Bond movie, yet, it is a fact. A fact that the media has refused to publicize, even attempting to cover it up, and deny its very existence.
In the 1844 political novel Coningsby by Benjamin Disraeli, the British Prime Minister, a character known as Sidonia (which was based on Lord Rothschild, whose family he had become close friends with in the early 1840's) says:
"That mighty revolution which is at this moment preparing in Germany and which will be in fact a greater and a second Reformation, and of which so little is as yet known in England, is entirely developing under the auspices of the Jews, who almost monopolize the professorial chairs of Germany... the world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes."
On September 10, 1876, in Aylesbury, Disraeli said:
"The governments of the present day have to deal not merely with other governments, with emperors, kings and ministers, but also with secret societies which have everywhere their unscrupulous agents, and can at the last moment upset all the governments' plans."
On October 1, 1877, Henry Edward Manning, Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, said of the trouble in the Balkan States:
"It is not emperors or kings, nor princes, that direct the course of affairs in the East. There is something else over them and behind them; and that thing is more powerful than them."
In 1902, Pope Leo XIII wrote of this power:
"It bends governments to its will sometimes by promises, sometimes by threats. It has found its way into every class of Society, and forms an invisible and irresponsible power, an independent government, as it were, within the body corporate of the lawful state."
"It bends governments to its will sometimes by promises, sometimes by threats.
It has found its way into every class of Society, and forms an invisible and irresponsible power, an independent government, as it were, within the body corporate of the lawful state."
Walter Rathenau, head of German General Electric, said in 1909:
"Three hundred men, all of whom know one another, direct the economic destiny of Europe and choose their successors from among themselves."
President Woodrow Wilson said in 1913:
"Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it."

John F. Hylan, mayor of New York City (1918-25), said in a March 26, 1922 speech:
"...the real menace of our Republic is this invisible government which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy length over city, state and nation. Like the octopus of real life, it operates under cover of a self-created screen... At the head of this octopus are the Rockefeller Standard Oil interests and a small group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as 'the international bankers.' The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States Government for their own selfish purposes. They practically control both political parties."

The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States Government for their own selfish purposes. They practically control both political parties."
In the December, 1922 edition of Foreign Affairs, Philip Kerr wrote:
"Obviously there is going to be no peace or prosperity for mankind as long as (the earth) remains divided into 50 or 60 independent states until some kind of international system is created The real problem today is that of the world government."
In a letter dated November 21, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to confidant Colonel Edward House:
"The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson."
In her novel, Captains and the Kings, Taylor Caldwell wrote of the "plot against the people," and says that it wasn't,
"until the era of the League of Just Men and Karl Marx that conspirators and conspiracies became one, with one aim, one objective, and one determination."
Some heads of foreign governments refer to this group as "The Magicians," Stalin called them "The Dark Forces," and President Eisenhower described them as "the military-industrial complex."
In the July 26, 1936 issue of the New York Times, Joseph Kennedy, patriarch of the Kennedy family, was quoted as saying:
"Fifty men have run America and that's a high figure."
In 1952, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, said:
"The real rulers in Washington are invisible, and exercise power from behind the scenes."
According to the California State Investigating Committee on Education (1953):
"So-called modern Communism is apparently the same hypocritical and deadly world conspiracy to destroy civilization that was founded by the secret order of The Illuminati in Bavaria on May 1, 1776, and that raised its whorey head in our colonies here at the critical period before the adoption of our Federal Constitution."
This purpose of this book is to show the connection between the Illuminati, and what would become known as the New World Order.
Through the years, the term 'Illuminati' has developed an anti-Semitic connotation, because some researchers have insisted that the move toward a one world government has been engineered as part of a Jewish conspiracy. This is not true.
One of the documents that provided evidence concerning this has been proven to be a complete fabrication. Although some of the International Bankers which actually control this group are Jewish, there is no basis for indicting the entire Jewish race.
In 1966, Dr. Carroll Quigley, a professor of history at the Foreign Service School of Georgetown University, published a 1311-page book called Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time.
On page 950 he says:
"There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups, and frequently does so.
I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records.
I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments... my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known... because the American branch of this organization (sometimes called the 'Eastern Establishment') has played a very significant role in the history of the United States in the last generation."
On page 324, he elaborates even further by saying:
"In addition to these pragmatic goals, the powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole.
This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements, arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the worlds' central banks which were themselves private corporations.
The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralization of world economic control and use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and indirect injury of all other economic groups."
Bill Clinton, during his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, said:
"As a teenager, I heard John Kennedy's summons to citizenship. And then, as a student at Georgetown (University where he attended 1964-68) I heard that call clarified by a professor I had named Carroll Quigley."
This is where Clinton received his indoctrination as an internationalist favoring one-world government.
In the mid-1970's, Dr. Tom Berry, who was pastor of the Baptist Bible Church in Elkton, Maryland, said: "At most, there are only 5,000 people in the whole world who have a significant understanding of the plan."
Professor Arnold Toynbee (a founding member of the Round Table) said in a June, 1931 speech to the Institute of International Affairs in Copenhagen:
"We are at present working discreetly with all our might to wrest this mysterious force called sovereignty out of the clutches of the local nation states of the world."
H. G. Wells, a member of the Fabian Society, wrote in his 1933 book The Shape of Things to Come:
"Although world government has been plainly coming for some years, although it had been endlessly feared and murmured against, it found no opposition prepared anywhere."
Major General John Frederick Charles Fuller, a British military historian, said in 1941:
"The government of the Western nations, whether monarchical or republican, had passed into the invisible hands of a plutocracy, international in power and grasp. It was, I venture to suggest, this semi-occult power which pushed the masses of the American people into the cauldron of World War I."

On June 28, 1945, President Harry Truman said in a speech:
"It will be just as easy for nations to get along in a republic of the world as it is for us to get along in a republic of the United States."
On October 24, 1945, Senator Glen Taylor (D-Idaho) introduced Senate Resolution No. 183, which called for the Senate to go on record as advocating the establishment of a world republic, including an international police force.
In 1947, the American Education Fellowship (formerly known as the Progressive Education Association) called for the "establishment of a genuine world order, an order in which national sovereignty is subordinate to world authority "
Brock Chisholm, the first director of the UN World Health Organization said:
"To achieve one world government it is necessary to remove from the minds of men their individualism, their loyalty to family traditions and national identification."
On February 9, 1950, a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee introduced Concurrent Resolution 66 which began:
"Whereas, in order to achieve universal peace and justice, the present Charter of the United Nations should be changed to provide a true world government constitution."
James Warburg, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17, 1950:
"We shall have world government whether or not you like it, by conquest or consent."
Sen. William Jenner said in a February 23, 1954 speech:
"Today the path to total dictatorship in the United States can be laid by strictly legal means, unseen and unheard by the Congress, the President, or the people...
Outwardly we have a constitutional government. We have operating within our government and political system, another body representing another form of government, a bureaucratic elite which believes our Constitution is outmoded and is sure that it is the winning side...
All the strange developments in foreign policy agreements may be traced to this group who are going to make us over to suit their pleasure... This political action group has its own local political support organizations, its own pressure groups, its own vested interests, its foothold within our government."
In September, 1960, Elmo Roper, in an address called "The Goal is Government of All the World" said:
"For it becomes clear that the first step toward world government cannot be completed until we have advanced on the four fronts: the economic, the military, the political and the social."
In a 1963 symposium (sponsored by the leftist Fund for the Republic, of the Ford Foundation) called
"The Elite and the Electorate: Is Government by the People Possible?"
Senator J. William Fulbright, the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said:
"The case for government by elites is irrefutable... government by the people is possible but highly improbable"
Sen. Russell Long of Louisiana, who for 18 years was the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that our,
"government is completely and totally out of control. We do not know how much long term debt we have put on the American people. We don't even know our financial condition from year to year..."
"We have created a bureaucracy in Washington so gigantic that it is running this government for the bureaucracy, the way they want, and not for the people of the United States. We no longer have representative government in America."
Congressman Larry P. McDonald, who, in 1983 was killed in the Korean Airlines flight 007 that had been shot down by the Soviets said:
"The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent."
Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was President Carter's National Security Advisor, said:
" this regionalization is in keeping with the tri-lateral plan which calls for a gradual convergence of East and West, ultimately leading toward the goal of 'one world government' National sovereignty is no longer a viable concept "
Norman Cousins, the honorary Chairman of Planetary Citizens for the World We Chose (as well as the President of the World Federalist Association) is quoted in the magazine Human Events as saying:
"World government is coming, in fact, it is inevitable. No arguments for or against it can change that fact."
During the 1991 Bilderberger Conference held in Evians, France, Dr. Henry Kissinger said:
"Today, America would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order (referring to the riot caused by the Rodney King incident). Tomorrow they will be grateful!
This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown.
When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government."
On October 29, 1991, David Funderburk, a former U.S. Ambassador to Romania (1981-85), told a group in North Carolina:
"George Bush has been surrounding himself with people who believe in one-world government. They believe that the Soviet system and the American system are converging," and the manner in which they would accomplish that was through the United Nations, "the majority of whose 166 member states are socialist, atheist, and anti-American."
Time magazine on July 20, 1992, in an article called "The Birth of the Global Nation," Strobe Talbott, an Editor (later Clinton's Deputy Secretary of State) wrote:
"In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn't such a good idea after all... But it has taken the events in our own wondrous and terrible century to clinch the case for world government."
In 1993 he received the Norman Cousins Global Governance Award for the article and for what he has accomplished "for the cause of global governance."
Pope John Paul II said:
"By the end of this decade (2000) we will live under the first one world government One world government is inevitable."
Haven't you wondered why things are the way they are.
That even though a new President is elected and a new Administration takes over, executive policy does not change, nor does the State of the Nation - which continues to get worse.
Is there some sort of group that has infiltrated both political parties, our government, and many other governments, which has for years been creating and controlling world events, and is only now being officially identified, because it is too late to stop this juggernaut? Yes, I believe there is.
That is the purpose of this book, to trace the origin and growth of the group which has come to be known as the New World Order, and why there is such a massive campaign to accept it.
President Bill Clinton said in his first inaugural address:
"Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world, and the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy."
You need to know just exactly what these changes are, and how they will affect the lives and you and your family.
Abraham Lincoln's pledge of "government of the people, by the people, for the people," has become a joke.
After reading this book, you will know why things are the way they are; and when you hear that 'They' are responsible for something, you will know who 'They' are.
