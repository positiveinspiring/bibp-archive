Imagine a future where water is more valuable than gold - where corporations
have control over the publics water sources, and everyone has to pay a
premium for access.
Its a scary thought for most of us, but for
T. Boone Pickens, its a dream hes banking on.
When Pickens, a billionaire oil tycoon, purchased eight miles of bare
scrubland in the Texas panhandle recently, some people were confused:
theres no oil in them there flatlands. What hes interested in, though,
isnt black gold, its blue gold: water, contained within the Ogallala
Aquifer partially located under the ranch.
His plan was to build a pipeline from the
aquifer to larger cities, selling the water as a commodity that, at least in
his mind, would undoubtedly be in demand during times of drought.
While it seems like there should be some kind of law against doing such a
thing, the groundwater laws in Texas and many other states make it easy to
get away with. When the laws were put into place, water was so abundant and
readily available that no one ever considered the idea that people might try
to buy and sell it in this way.
So when it was time to vote on allowing the
creation of Pickens water district, the only people required to vote on it
were the people who live on the land: Pickens, his wife and three employees.
From
Bloomberg News:
Pickens has pulled a shenanigan, said
Phillip Smith, a rancher who serves on a local water-conservation board.
Hes obtained the right of eminent domain like he was a big city. Its
supposed to be for the public good, not a private company.
Pickens and his allies say no shenanigans are involved.
Once the
district is created, the board will be able to issue tax-exempt bonds to
finance construction of Pickenss planned 328-mile, $2.2 billion
pipeline to transport water from the panhandle across the prairie to the
suburbs of Dallas and San Antonio.
Pickens was
recently in the news for spending
big bucks on wind farms.
His move toward investing in alternative energy
doesnt mean hes an environmental activist, though: hes in it for the
money. While theres nothing wrong with businesses making profits off
products, policies and practices that are beneficial to the environment,
Pickens past and present ventures make it clear hes no friend to the
earth.
In fact, hes admitted that hes taking
advantage of public fears about climate change, and hes obviously not too
concerned about the environmental impact of draining
the Ogallala Aquifer.
Amidst current awareness about global warming, he feels confident that hell
soon be making big money off the business of selling water. Population
growth, prolonged droughts and the production of certain biofuels continues
to put a tremendous strain on water resources, and Pickens doesnt see why
he shouldnt pad his bank account as a result.
The Ogallala runs through an area of America thats already threatened.
Annual withdrawal from this aquifer is already outpacing the recharge rate
by 300%. The amount of groundwater in the aquifer has been steadily
declining in recent years. The government also faces a hurdle that
billionaires with access to oil might be able to jump more easily: the
rising cost of energy needed to pump water from the aquifer is making it
tougher to access it.
The
USDA laments that,
even in areas where the pumping depth is
economical, geology limits pumping access as the water table declines.
Undoubtedly, a public water crisis is brewing.
While other countries have been suffering a lack
of water for years, America has remained largely insulated from the problem.
Were only beginning to experience the effects of a water shortage,
partially due to
unscrupulous deals made by bottling companies like Nestle
along with Americas dependence on bottled water.
The more people buy bottled water, the less
money goes into the public water system. Corporations with dollar sign
fairies dancing in their minds see it as an opportunity to grab and wield
control over the supply. In a country dominated by a winner takes all
capitalist attitude, that sets us up for trouble.
What exactly would the corporate privatization of water mean to the public?
For one thing, water would no longer be considered something that all people
have a right to. It would be a commodity, bought and sold by private
individuals and companies, based on availability and the publics
willingness to pay. Corporations tend to value profits over service.
Obviously, we cant live without water. Wed be
at the mercy of the people in control.
T. Boone Pickens isnt the only one grabbing up water rights. In fact, most
of the companies that are buying land with access to aquifers are foreign.
Major players here and abroad include Viviendi, Perrier, Suez, Bechtel and
Monsanto.
Right now, only 5 percent of the water supply is
in corporate hands, but that could change at any time, especially as the
World Bank and other organizations push for privatization.
The only obstacle that remains in Pickens and other investors path is
finding buyers. Several water districts have already refused to sign up,
mostly due to pressure from political and environmental groups campaigning
against the privatization of water.
The Sierra Club is one of them, and their
efforts to educate the public in Texas might just pay off. Until the day
that Texas gets so dry officials are desperate for water and willing to do
just about anything to get it, that is. Then a ball may be set in motion
that will change public water access as we know it.
We can only hope that other solutions are put
forth before that becomes a reality.
There Will Be Water

Pickens hopes to run a water pipeline over 250
miles
and 650 tracts of private property from the Texas Panhandle
to thirsty
Dallas Nancy Newberry
T. Boone Pickens thinks water is the new oil - and he's betting $100 million
that he's right
One of them is T. Boone Pickens, the oilman and
corporate raider, who first bought some property here in 1971 to hunt quail.
He's now the largest landowner in the county: His Mesa Vista ranch sprawls
across some 68,000 acres. Pickens has also bought up the rights to a
considerable amount of water that lies below this part of the High Plains in
a vast aquifer that came into existence millions of years ago.
If water is the new oil, T. Boone Pickens is a modern-day John D.
Rockefeller.
Pickens owns more water than any other
individual in the U.S. and is looking to control even more. He hopes to sell
the water he already has, some 65 billion gallons a year, to Dallas,
transporting it over 250 miles, 11 counties, and about 650 tracts of private
property. The electricity generated by an enormous wind farm he is setting
up in the Panhandle would also flow along that corridor.
As far as Pickens is concerned, he could be
selling wind, water, natural gas, or uranium; it's all a matter of supply
and demand.
"There are people who will buy the water
when they need it. And the people who have the water want to sell it.
That's the blood, guts, and feathers of the thing," he says.
In the coming decades, as growing numbers of
people live in urban areas and climate change makes some regions much more
prone to drought, water - or what many are calling "blue gold" - will become
an increasingly scarce resource.
By 2030 nearly half of the world's population
will inhabit areas with severe water stress, according to the Organization
for Economic Cooperation & Development. Pickens understands that. And while
Texas is unusually lax in its laws about pumping groundwater, the rush to
control water resources is gathering speed around the planet.
In Australia, now in the sixth year of a
drought, brokers in urban areas are buying up water rights from farmers.
Rural residents around the U.S. are trying to sell their land (and water) to
multi- national water bottlers like Nestl√© (BW - Apr. 14).
Companies that
use large quantities of the precious resource to run their businesses are
seeking to lock up water supplies. One is Royal Dutch Shell, which is buying
groundwater rights in Colorado as it prepares to drill for oil in the shale
deposits there.
Into this environment comes Pickens, who made a good living for a long time
extracting oil and gas and now, at 80, believes the era of fossil fuel is
over. So far he has spent $100 million and eight years on his project and
still has not found any city in Texas willing to buy his water.
But like
many others, Pickens believes there's a fortune to be made in slaking the
thirst of a rapidly growing population.
If he pumps as much as he can, he could sell
about $165 million worth of water to Dallas each year.
"The idea that water can be sold for private
gain is still considered unconscionable by many," says James M. Olson,
one of America's preeminent attorneys specializing in water- and
land-use law.
"But the scarcity of water and the extraordinary profits
that can be made may overwhelm ordinary public sensibilities."
THE BIGGEST PUMP WINS
Pickens, an Oklahoma native, geologist, and someone who calls himself the
luckiest guy in the world, is the quintessential entrepreneur.
Pickens at his Mesa Vista ranch
in 2003 David Bowser/Black Star
He started as a wildcatter in 1956; three
decades later his Mesa Petroleum was the largest independent exploration
company in the U.S. But that's not how Pickens made a name for himself - it
was his hostile bids, one after the other through the 1980s, for oil
companies far more powerful, far wealthier than his own.
Pickens thought
they could do more for their shareholders.
He never took over any of them. He did, however,
push them into deals they might not have considered otherwise, which helped
reshape the oil industry.
He did, sometimes, make hundreds of millions when he sold his stakes. And
shareholders did, often, benefit. He was briefly the most famous businessman
in America, a corporate raider who always wished people would call him a
shareholder activist.
By the mid-1990s, though, Pickens had fallen. After a brutal and expensive
fight with Unocal, he gave up his raiding. He lost control of Mesa Petroleum
after a series of financial and managerial miscalculations. He went through
an expensive divorce from his second wife and retreated to his ranch.
It was in the midst of this that he acquired a
newfound regard for water as a commodity that should be bought, sold, and
traded for the benefit of those who own it and those who can afford it.
In 1996 a local water utility made its first big purchase of groundwater
rights in the Panhandle. The utility, known as the Canadian River Municipal
Water Authority (CRMWA), bought nearly 43,000 acres of water, some of it
just south of Pickens' ranch, for $14.5 million. (Property owners in Texas,
and elsewhere, can sell their water separately from the land above it.)
That Roberts County would become the stomping
ground for the Panhandle water wars was perhaps inevitable.
Underneath it lies one of the world's largest
repositories of water, moving slowly among layers of gravel, sand, and silt.
The Ogallala Aquifer stretches from Texas to South Dakota and contains a
quadrillion gallons of water - enough to cover the U.S. mainland to a depth
of almost two feet.
Yet the extensive irrigation necessary to grow
corn, cotton, and wheat in west Texas has left the Ogallala nearly depleted
in some places. It is not an aquifer that is easily or quickly replenished.
But the land in Roberts County is unsuited for agriculture, and so the
Ogallala there is largely untapped.
Since the early 1900s, groundwater use in Texas has been governed by what's
quaintly called the rule of capture, otherwise described as the biggest pump
wins. It lets landowners pump as much water as they can, even if doing so
drains neighboring properties.
This put Pickens in an uncomfortable position:
If he didn't sell his water to CRMWA, the utility could potentially suck
some of it right out from under his ranch.
So he tried.
But "they told me to kiss off," he says.
Kent Satterwhite, who was then assistant general
manager, says:
"Boone was fairly insistent that we buy his
water. It made him mad that we didn't have the money to buy it."
That was the first of several contretemps
between Pickens and various local water authorities. Pickens next approached
the city of Amarillo, which also had begun to acquire water rights in
Roberts County.
It wasn't interested, either, though it did
purchase water from several other nearby landowners.
"Amarillo was pissed off at me," says
Pickens, who has a long and fraught history with the city.
When Amarillo turned him down, Pickens felt
surrounded.
"I had to find a buyer for my water," he
says, "or I was going to be drained."
LANDOWNERS DIVIDED
There's a saying in Texas:
"Whiskey's for drinking. Water's for
fighting."
Pickens decided to fight.
In 1999 he created a company called Mesa Water
and began to accumulate water rights so he could strike a deal with another
city altogether. The hell with Amarillo. Pickens was confident he could sell
his water: The population of Texas was expected to jump 40% by 2020, mostly
in urban areas one dry season away from drought.
Pickens' decision to get into the water business was regarded by some in the
Panhandle as nothing more, or less, than a shrewd move by a man who knows
the value of commodities. The economy of the High Plains region is based on
people taking out the natural resources and selling them. If water that
can't be used for farming ends up in the taps of city residents hundreds of
miles away, that's fine.
Pickens says he's buying stranded, surplus water
that needs to be rescued.
Kim Flowers, who runs an 8,300-acre ranch in
Roberts County, speaks for many landowners when she says:
"People can do with their water as they wish
as long as they're not wasting it."
In all, Pickens, CRMWA, and Amarillo have spent
about $150 million to buy up nearly 80% of the water rights in Roberts
County, undermining and outbidding one another along the way.
One unsurprising effect of their competition is
that the price of an acre of water has in some places doubled, to $600.
That's something in which Pickens takes pride. Much as he did in the 1980s,
when he went after big oil companies he believed weren't doing right by
their shareholders, Pickens now talks about creating value for Roberts
County landowners.
They make money from selling their water while
continuing to live, run cattle, and hunt on their property.
"I told them I was going to raise the value
of the land, and I accomplished that. The landowners are all tickled to
death. I made our water worth something. And anybody with any sense
would sell it."
Not all Roberts County landowners wanted to do
business with him, though.
Pickens intended to pull water from an aquifer
that is pretty much the sole source for the Panhandle, and that isn't
refilled quickly, and sell it to a place like Dallas, whose water use is the
highest of any city in Texas. This seemed ludicrous, even reckless, to some.
C.E. Williams runs the Panhandle Groundwater
Conservation District, which is responsible for managing the competing
demands on the region's share of the Ogallala.
He puts it this way:
"As a district, we cannot pick and choose
where the water goes. But personally I am concerned. I have a son who is
an irrigated farmer, and I have grandkids, and I want to make sure that
they can conduct commerce when they want to."
Pickens has a way of dismissing the complexity
of a situation, sometimes even the possibility of an opinion contrary to his
own.
In this case, any opposition to his plan from
anyone who is not a Roberts County landowner, who is not essentially a
shareholder in this venture, he deems irrelevant.
Williams, he points out, doesn't himself have
any property.
"Water is a commodity," he says. "Heck,
isn't it like oil? You have to come back to who owns the water. The
groundwater is owned by the landowner. That's it."
When it comes to potential buyers, Pickens cares
about only one thing: how much they're willing to pay.
"Do I care what Dallas does with the water?
Hell no."
Republican State Representative Warren Chisum is
a Roberts County rancher who owns 12,000 acres next to Pickens and sold his
water to Amarillo in 2001. He would seem to be a natural ally.
He's not.
"My water will remain local," he says. "It's
controversial to ship it out of the Panhandle. When we run out, we're
done. The long-term value is to keep it here. That's contrary to what
Pickens wants to do. It's his water. But he won't be here in 50 years."
In 2002, Pickens began approaching several of
Texas' sprawling cities, all of which share one defining feature:
Their
populations are growing so quickly that they are constantly in need of new
supplies of water.
But with water, as with so much else, location
is critical.
And Pickens' water is far, far away from anyplace that might
buy it. Pickens knew he'd have to build a pipeline, and to do so at anything
resembling a reasonable cost, he'd need the power of eminent domain - the
right of a government entity to force the sale of private property for the
public good.
Water utilities have that right. If Dallas
agreed to buy Pickens' water, it could extend such authority to him. But
Dallas deemed Pickens' price too high and declined to do a deal. So Pickens
and his executives tried to create a Fresh Water Supply District - a
government entity that would have that power. But they couldn't get it
through.
Over the next several years, Pickens continued accumulating water rights and
began to lease other land, this time with the idea of creating the world's
biggest wind farm.
"One of the great wind areas is right up
where we are," says Robert L. Stillwell, Pickens' general counsel. "You
can set it right on top of where the water is."
And since, one day anyway, Dallas may well buy
both, Mesa could use a single right-of-way for the water pipeline and the
electric lines.
In Roberts County there would be real economic benefits from the wind farm.
"The wind is meant to sweeten the deal,"
says Representative Chisum. "The big money for Pickens is in the water."
It had been a decade since Pickens first
realized the potential value of the water deposited eons ago in the sand
below the High Plains. Now it was time to employ the one resource he hadn't
yet used: his lobbying clout.
POWERFUL LOBBYING
In January, 2007, the Texas Legislature convened in the grand statehouse in
Austin.
The 80th session turned out to be very
productive, and one person who kept busy during that time was J.E. Buster
Brown, a former state senator and one of the most powerful lobbyists in
town.
Among Brown's clients is Mesa Water.
"My job is primarily defensive," Brown says
of his work for Pickens.
"I'm watching to make sure there is no
legislation passed that creates obstacles to Pickens doing what he wants
to do. I'm supposed to make sure nothing bad happens."
Brown did more than that: He helped win Pickens
a key new legal right. It was contained in an amendment to a major piece of
water legislation.
The amendment, one of more than 100 added after
the bill had been reviewed in the House, allowed a water-supply district to
transmit alternative energy and transport water in a single corridor, or
right-of-way.
"We helped move that along," says Stillwell.
"We thought it would be handy and helpful to everyone."
After the bill passed, Tom "Smitty"
Smith, Texas
director of Public Citizens, an advocacy group, says several legislators
were drinking coffee and reading through it.
"Uh-oh," one said.
They'd just realized the amendment would help
Pickens build his pipeline.
"Many legislators were watching for this
play," Smith says, "and it still snuck by."
State Senator Robert Duncan, a Republican who
represents Lubbock, says:
"It probably should have raised our
suspicions, but we were moving a lot of bills. And it would have been
hard to hold up this one even if we'd discovered the amendment."
Pickens still needed the power of eminent domain
if he was going to build his pipeline and wind-power lines across private
land.
And by happy coincidence, the legislators passed
a smaller bill that made that all the easier. The new legislation loosened
the requirements for creating a water district. Previously, a district's
five elected supervisors needed to be registered voters living within the
boundaries of the district. Now, they only had to own land in the district;
they could live and vote wherever.
The bill, as it happens, was put forth by two
legislators from Houston; Brown says he and Mesa had nothing to do with it.
"That wasn't our bill," says Brown. "I wish
I could take credit for it."
Pickens moved quickly to take advantage of the
new rules.
Over the summer of 2007, he sold eight acres on
the back side of his ranch to five people in his employ: Stillwell, who
resides in Houston, two of his executives in Dallas, and the couple who
manage his ranch, Alton and Lu Boone. A few days later, Mesa Water filed a
petition to create an eight-acre water-supply district with those five as
the directors and sole members.
On Nov. 6, Roberts County held an election to
decide whether to form the new district. Only two people were qualified to
take part: Alton and Lu Boone. The vote was unanimous. With that, Pickens
won the right to issue tax-free bonds for his pipeline and electrical lines
as well as the extraordinary power to claim land across swaths of the state.
No one at Mesa regards Roberts County Fresh Water Supply District No. 1 as
an unusual arrangement.
"We're no different from any other water or
electricity supplier," says Stillwell, meaning they, too, would use the
power of eminent domain only as a last resort and for the public good.
As for the suggestion that he wouldn't have
qualified to be a board member under the old rules, Stillwell says:
"It doesn't matter that I'm on the board. It
would have been another me, just a local me."
"WE'RE NOT HAPPY"
Pickens was ready to reach out to landowners along the route.
In April, 2008, Mesa sent out some 1,100 letters
to people along the 250-mile proposed right-of-way, from Miami, Tex., to a
town called Jacksboro, just short of Dallas. The letters included a Texas
landowners' bill of rights, information on the condemnation procedure, a map
of the route, and a list of open houses they could attend for more
information.
One stifling evening in May, about 50 people showed up at the Twin Lakes
Community Activity Center just outside Jacksboro.
When the ranchers arrived, more than a dozen of
Mesa's public-relations consultants, hydrologists, and land men were waiting
for them. Standing behind tables laid out with pens, cups, hats, and bags
with the District No. 1 logo, the officials were available to answer
questions about the 250-foot-wide corridor Mesa would use to construct,
maintain, and possibly expand the pipeline and electric lines.
While this arrangement allowed everyone to get
information specific to their property, it also precluded any public
questioning of the Mesa standard-bearers.
This did not go unnoticed by the ranchers.
"We're not happy," said one. "Pickens is
pushing his power trip on us. I can't fight his money. But if he asked
first, I might have thought better of it."
Another said:
"Land goes way back for a lot of people
here. If you tell people you want their land, Texans raise their guns."
At the end of the evening, most of the pens and
hats and cups still lay on the tables.
Pickens isn't bothered that by his invoking the right of eminent domain,
Mesa has inflamed landowners up and down the route.
"It always does," he says.
Mesa expects to acquire the land it needs in the
next 18 months and pay about $30 million for it; Pickens wants to begin
construction on the $1.2 billion pipeline right afterward. It should take
about three years to complete.
If all goes according to plan, Mesa will be able
to pump enough water to satisfy the needs of some 1.5 million Texans every
day.
Pickens hopes to strike a deal with Dallas or the urban areas around it
before Mesa starts building the pipeline.
"Eventually they will need it," he says.
So far, though, the talks might best be
characterized as preliminary.
"We continue to meet with Pickens' staff and
engineers to get a better understanding of the proposal and so they can
understand what our needs are," says Mike Rickman, assistant general
manager of the North Texas Municipal Water District, which supplies
water to 13 cities north and east of Dallas.
"Mesa has a lot of water. But how much will
it cost to buy it and deliver it?"
Rickman says that at some point he would have to
consider the consequences for the Ogallala:
"Does it make sense to take water from an
arid portion of the state? We don't want to harm our neighbors out
there."
In Roberts County, people hold on to the hope
that pumping from the Ogallala can be controlled.
In 1998, as Pickens and local water utilities
began buying up water rights, the groundwater conservation district placed
some restrictions on the rule of capture that it calls the 50-50 rule:
Anyone who receives a new permit to pump can draw down the aquifer by only
50% over the next 50 years. Later, an additional limit of 1.2% per year was
set.
These essentially manage the depletion of the
Ogallala under Roberts County; there, it is replenished at a rate of only
0.1% a year. Williams, who put the rules into place, says:
"It's like taking dollar bills out of your
bank account and putting nickels back in. Even with a big bank account,
there's an end. That's pretty much what's happening in the Ogallala."
Pickens has promised to abide by the 50-50 rule.
"I don't have any concerns about depleting
the aquifer. All I'm doing is selling surplus water," he says.
"I'm not about to drain all the water out of
Roberts County. I have my ranch there. But I could sure take it down 50%
and not hurt anybody. And it could make a lot of people a lot of money."
