In a column entitled The
Satanist link to intelligence operations disguised as religious sects,
Benjamin Fulford has accused
the
Dalai Lama of being a Satanist.
In that column, Ben says:
"One of the most powerful weapons used by
the Satanists in their plot to create a totalitarian world government is
the use of certain religious sects such as
Moonies, the Dalai Lamas network,
Falun Gong and others. The trail
ultimately leads to the
Federal Reserve Board crime syndicate and the Satanic part of
the
Vatican centered around the Vatican bank."
The inclusion of the Dalai Lama in the
network of Satanists may come as a surprise to many but the evidence
speaks for itself.
The main scam these religions use is to publicly promote ideas that
almost everybody can agree with, such as helping the poor, in order to
con people out of their money. The Satanist religions also always have a
centralized power structure with layers of secrecy protecting a single
leader who is promoted as a representative of God on earth.
Let us examine the case of the Dalai Lama to illustrate what I am
talking about. The Dalai Lama is a symbol to many around the world of
all that is good and tolerant about
Buddhism. Unfortunately, Buddhism and the teachings of the
Buddha, however, have little to do with the actual Dalai Lama. The holy
Dalai Lama that exists in most peoples minds is very different from the
actual human who is the Dalai Lama.
My own rude awakening came when I heard him
talk for 90 minutes at the Foreign Correspondents Club in Japan. What I
saw was a very rude and evil looking man who publicly and repeatedly
insulted several Chinese reporters without provocation.
The Dalai Lamas network in Japan has also,
I believe, personally harmed me which may be why I have a special grudge
against him. My fianc√©e was five months pregnant and working for a
Nepalese import shop when she was suddenly asked to go to Nepal to buy
items for the shop. While she was in the airplane en route, the man
sitting directly across from her in the plane died of a heart attack.
When she got to Nepal she was met by a senior official in the Dalai
Lamas network (I will not name him because his son has been a useful
informant) who took her to his home. The following day, she suddenly
started bleeding heavily from her womb and was taken to the hospital
where she was drugged unconscious. When she woke up the following day,
they were doing a ultra-sound scan of her womb. She was no longer
pregnant.
Also, by some curious coincidence, a Japanese man staying at a house
across the street from where she was was beheaded by a Nepalese police
officer while she was there. Curious, isnt it?

I wont be posting the whole column.
Ben is an adult and undoubtedly knows what hes
doing in leveling such an accusation against the Tibetan leader. He
undoubtedly knows it will cause a great deal of grief in the world to hear
such a report.
However, Im not certain enough of the factual basis of his charges to want
to lend them credence by publishing the whole column, until it has been
legally substantiated or at least commented on by those with reliable
knowledge of the situation and a background in legal commentary.
I caution others against taking the position that where theres smoke,
theres fire.
The Illuminati use our susceptibility to
this argument to produce a great deal of smoke, which is only smoke and no
evidence of fire. Their tsunami of allegations against President
Obama
and
Julian Assange are illustrations of
this tactic.
A great deal of smoke about the Dalai Lama may
just be smoke. So please use your discrimination.
Please keep in mind that the greatest amount of damage is done when
allegations first emerge (and the Illuminati know this). Retractions after
the fact usually appear in the back pages and dont reach near as many
people as the initial allegations. I recommend withholding judgment of the
Dalai Lama until reliable proof is presented.
That having been said,
the galactics have told us repeatedly
that we will be shocked by some of the things we hear after disclosure.
Here is SaLuSa for instance:
However, the full truth will come out in
good time, for your appreciation and understanding of the last century.
It will be shocking and beyond belief for
most people. It is not the intention that you should waste too much
energy on such matters, and your focus should remain on your immediate
future.
The Laws of the Universe are immutable, and
be sure any soul that has erred in their judgment and actions will face
the truth of the consequences.
(SaLuSa,
Nov. 10, 2010)
