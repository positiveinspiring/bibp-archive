Are you watching this latest pattern in the news?
Mega scandals about Benghazi and the IRS and
more breaking out and seeming to threaten the charade we call our
government? Even liberal mainstays like the leg-thrilled Chris Matthews
are getting in on the Obama bashing bandwagon with all thats seeming to be
revealed
Chris Matthews Sours on Obama
Politico
President Obama,
obviously likes giving speeches more than he does running
the executive branch, Chris Matthews said tonight.
Yes, you read that right:
The MSNBC host who in 2008 felt a thrill going up
my leg after hearing Obama speak has grown disenchanted.
Tonights episode
of Hardball saw Chris Matthews delivering a rare, unforgiving grilling of the
president as severe as anything that might appear on Fox News.
What part of the presidency does Obama
like?
He doesnt like dealing with other politicians - that means his
own cabinet, that means members of the congress, either party. He
doesnt particularly like the press
He likes to write the speeches,
likes to rewrite what Favreau and the others wrote for the first draft,
Matthews said.
So what part does he like? He likes going
on the road, campaigning, visiting businesses like he does every couple
days somewhere in Ohio or somewhere, Matthews continued.
But what part does he like? He doesnt like
lobbying for the bills he cares about. He doesnt like selling to the
press. He doesnt like giving orders or giving somebody the power to
give orders.
He doesnt seem to like being an executive.
Wow, Chris. So sharp of you to notice.
Not
taking your Obamameds? What happened? Somehow I hear BB King playing a
certain lick for you
:
Is A Wake Up of Mainstream
and Its Sycophants Possible?
Lets hope so, some maybe, but I doubt it will take.
They have their hands
on the on/off switch. The manipulators are heavy handed as a first and last
resort, while always pretending to care or protect. The point is, these are
precarious times, and when you see these signals you need to watch very
carefully - right, left, center, up and down
and behind you.
Anything could break loose.
They are ripe to distract, using any measure necessary when it gets iffy for
them. Theyd micro-nuke an American city at the drop of a hat.
9/11 was a
warm up. A very effective one but they are capable of much worse, and
probably have some mass sacrifice planned for these later phases of their
plan for world dominance.
Were dealing with very dark occult entities who
have established massive inroads into human enablers whove sold their souls
for their given self-aggrandizing seemingly flawless machinations for
control and their version of Utopia.
Oddly enough without regard for the welfare of the current population. A
little give away there, you think?
If you think regular humanity is in for a wake up - just wait until these
self-serving cooperating-on the-ground traitors to humanity find out theyve
been played like voluntary chained slave rowers in an ancient attack ship
about to drop to the bottom of the sea after fruitlessly ramming the SSTruth.
I have no sympathy for their plight. They should have asked some serious
questions sooner, self serving death dealing bastards. You cross over the
line you get whats on the other side.
Its that simple.
Who Is Obama?
From the get go this guy was an illusion splayed on to the hive mind by
projected reality TV. Thats all. Nothing more.
Hes a creation for
adoration, an image to feel comfortable and good about yourself with. Thats
about it. Then they can make him say whatever the hell they want and the
masses will swallow it.
Thats why he golf's, vacations, looks so cool, and trots his bullshit to
willing local audiences. Matthews might be catching on, but as I said,
theyll thwart a full on realization, they always do.
Hes so sold out
theres not much hope just in him, but we can hope.
I dont give this cretin Obama credit for anything except being a
complete sellout to the illusion he was programmed with. Even then, hes no
doubt a mind controlled cardboard cutout illusion that walks.
His rhythmic
chants are pusillanimous tripe that neither make rational sense nor have any
connectivity to reality.
But as I say, whos looking?
Onward, Warriors!
Its not fun to point out the absolute evil pervading our current system,
world, government, society
however you perceive it.
But identify it and its
trends we must. When we track the operations of our invading, occupying
enemy it empowers our sense of identity and in this environment our
community, as we see the same things and so many need the enrichment and
encouragement.
Its much like those fighting the mechanical, intelligent machine forces
in the Terminator series, as the flesh and blood humans retreated to their
hidden bunkers, caring for and protecting their precious young.
Use wisdom in your interactions, always keep a look out in every way, and
act wisely.
Never fear.
We are one. We are many. We are The Force.
Its They who will have to deal with the REAL consequences.
We know Who we are.
The real meaning of life is in the living. Not just living
but living for
the right things. Its all about the direction of heart.
Keep on confidently...
