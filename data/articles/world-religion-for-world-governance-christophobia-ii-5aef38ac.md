The World Economic Forum believes that like all other global
challenges, it will take the collaborative effort of all
stakeholders from government, business, religion, media, academia
and civil society to pre-empt any crisis (between the West and
Islam), create alliances and find solutions
(Professor
Klaus Schwab, Founder and
Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, Jan. 23, 2007)
Where does Christophobia come
from?
On Nov. 1, 2007
the Daily Mail brought a remarkable article: The Institute
for Public Policy Research was commissioned for this plan, when Downing
Street's advisor, Nick Pearce, was its director.
10 Downing Street
The Christmas tree now annoys
the New World Order's dhimmi resident
The report robustly defends multiculturalism -
the idea that different communities should not be forced to integrate but
should be allowed to maintain their own culture and identities.
If we are going to continue as a nation to
mark Christmas - and it would be very hard to expunge it from our
national life even if we wanted to - then public organizations should
mark other religious festivals too.
We can no longer define ourselves as
a christian nation, nor an especially religious one in any sense.
Who might influence
Nick Pearce , Gordon Brown's advisor, to foster such odd ideas?
As shown in the Congressional Record - on 15 December 1987,
Jesse Helms
dropped a bombshell in the US Senate.
He denounced,
the State Department, the Trade Department,
certain banking and financial groups, multinationals and tax-exempt
foundations [saying that they were effectively controlled by]
organizations such as the
CFR, the
RIIA, the
Trilateral Commission,
Aspen Institute the Dartmouth and
Bilderberg Meetings, the and the
Atlantic Institute, which are, he said, using them to spread and
coordinate plans for a so-called
New World Order
On the morals of what he called,
this secret system of government, he said,
The world views of these insiders are characterized by atheism and
materialism. All that matters to them is to maximize their profits.

themselves illuminists
Let us have a closer look at this Aspen Institute.
According to Wikipedia the
Aspen Institute is largely funded by foundations
such as the
Carnegie Corporation, The
Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the
Ford
Foundation, by seminar fees, and by individual donations.
Its board of
trustees includes a wide range of leaders from the realms of politics,
government, business, and academia who also contribute generously to its
support.
The Aspen Institute has 20 policy programs.
OK. The Rockefellers once again. And Ford and Carnegie - even J.P.Morgan -
Tony Blair's employer!
What is their aim here?

world
The
August Review Global elite Research
Center confirms the sponsors and states the following:
"Do the global elite promote a religion that
is complementary and integral in purpose to their New World Economic
Order and the World Governance?"
As we examine this subject, one cannot help but
note how the American court system is fanatically removing every semblance
of Judeo-Christian symbolism from public places using the argument of
"Separation of Church and State."
The Aspen Institute was formerly called the Aspen Institute for Humanistic
Studies.
HUMANISM - THE GLOBAL
IDEOLOGY
Humanism is a secular, atheistic religion that believes man is capable of
self-fulfillment, ethical conduct and salvation without supernatural
intervention.
The Aspen Institute calls for this and
self-awareness, self-correction, enlightened leadership, open-minded
dialogue, conflicting values etc. Some readers may equate these terms to New
Age Enlightenment, and that would be correct.
The following selected quotes from "Humanist Manifesto II" (1973) will give
you a general idea of its content:
"As in 1933, Humanists still believe that
traditional theism, especially faith in the prayer-hearing God, assumed
to love and care for persons, is an unproved and outmoded faith.
"Ethics is autonomous and situational,
needing no theological or ideological sanction."
(This gave birth to the phrase, "if it
feels good, do it.)
We urge that parochial loyalties and inflexible
moral and religious ideologies be transcended. A citizen of a world
community is mankind's finest goal."
There is an extraordinary parallelism between Humanists and Marxists. Among
the more obvious are:
-
rejection of traditional Christianity
and religion
-
the necessity for subordination of the
individual to state and the community
-
catchwords of both Humanism and Marxism
are "democracy, peace and high standard of living"
-
individual rights and beliefs are
non-existent
-
collectivism is supreme

Humanism today is being "taught" throughout the
business world by the Aspen Institute, which calls for the elimination of
nationalism and nationalistic boundaries.
In the past the editors have reported the
connections between,
The two leading foundations contributing to
Aspen are:
J.P. Morgan is also intimately connected with
the Aspen Institute.
At the meetings, a hotchpotch of corporate executives, military people,
intellectuals and media personages "mingle" and become "educated," typically
for a period of two weeks at a time.
This is a subtle form of brainwashing.
From the 20 Interfaith
Meeting 2006.
Note Pope Benedict XVI.
For 2 days the worlds
religious leaders pray
to a home-made common God for
world peace.
According to the
New Catholic Cathechism,
paragraph 841 also muslims are saved through Abraham's blessing - although
Muhammad's ancestor, Ismael, was refused to have it (Gen.17:18-21).
Thereby,
Christ is being made superfluous (John 14:6), which fits well into
the New World Order's program.
This whole project is illogical, identifying
Allah - who commands to kill any one saying he has a son (e.g. sura 9.5) -
with the father of Jesus, who commands neighbourly love -
without taking the neighbor to your home (2. John Letter:7-11).!!
One suspects that intellectual
Benedict XVI continues the Interfaith
tradition of his predecessor in order to save christians in muslim
countries. A religious mixing of the existing religions of the world is to
gather them together under a single umbrella of leadership and a common
framework that all can agree upon.
The best current example of such an effort is
seen with the United Religions Initiative (URI).
United Religions
Initiative and the Quest for World Religion
On May 14, 1999
Pope John
Paul II kissed the Quran in the Vatican,
and caused horror among
catholics.
As stated in his obituary in
the Houston Chronicle on Apr. 11, 2005:
"Supporting (muslim and
jewish) symbols was a commitment
to religious community and
the necessity of a global church according to experts".
URI was founded in 1993 as an Interfaith
organization that seeks to bind religions of the world into one common
organization.
URI has grown at a spectacular rate, up to 100%
more members a year. The people (and the organizations they represent) who
have drawn close to URI is striking.
To name a few,
-
World Economic Forum
-
Earth Charter movement
-
Ted Turner
-
Ford Foundation
-
Dee Hock (inventor of the VISA credit
card, founder and former CEO of VISA International)
-
Maurice Strong (Canadian billionaire)
-
Bill Gates (Microsoft founder),
...among others - all well-known illuminists.
The URI is also closely allied with
the United
Nations.
At least two URI summit conferences have been held at Stanford
University, the Research institute of which is the stronghold of
Rockefeller-supported
Tavistock-brainwashing.
And what do the recipients of this parody of the teachings of Christ
do? Thanks to mental hygiene we have either turned our backs on Christ
or been fobbed off with URIs home-made mess.
"For although we see this madness with our
own eyes and intellect we only believe what media and opinion formers -
among them unfortunately many clergymen - make us believe."
These are the words of an expert,
former KGB agent Bezmenov, about
applied mental hygiene in an uncanny video.
In 2000, URI co-sponsored the World Millennium Peace Summit of Religious
and Spiritual Leaders, held at the United Nations in New York City.
The religions represented at the summit included
Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Confucianism, Ba'hai, Christianity,
Indigenous, Judaism, Shinto, Jainism, Sikhism, Islam and Taoism, among
others.
We unite in responsible cooperative action
to bring the wisdom and values of our religions, spiritual expressions
and indigenous traditions to bear on the economic, environmental,
political and social challenges facing our Earth community.
This is the very unholy spirit of the
New
World Order: Politics and not God determines "religion".
The Leninist
Earth Charter is
kept in this "Ark of Hope"
along with ritual "Earth
masks" and Gaia prayer formulas.
It has its place at the
Interfaith Centre of New York,
but is moved to all over the world for big
environmental events
The principal spokesman for Earth Charter, and
its U.S. Chairman and Commissioner, is little known Steven C. Rockefeller,
son of the late Vice-President
Nelson A. Rockefeller.
Steven Rockefeller is the religious link to the New World Order being
promoted by organizations like the Trilateral Commission. He is Professor
emeritus of Religion.
Most importantly to this discussion, he was
Chairman of the Earth Charter International Drafting Committee alongside
with Gorbachev .
