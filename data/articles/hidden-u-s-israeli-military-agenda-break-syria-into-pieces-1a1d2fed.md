A timely article in the Jerusalem Post in
June brings to the forefront the unspoken objective of US foreign policy,
namely the breaking up of Syria as a sovereign nation state - along ethnic
and religious lines - into several separate and independent political
entities.
The article also confirms the role of Israel in
the process of political destabilization of Syria.
The
Jerusalem Post article (May 16, 2012) is titled:
Veteran Kurdish politician calls on Israel to support the break-up of Syria":
The objective
of the US sponsored armed insurgency is - with the help of Israel - to
Break Syria into Pieces.
The balkanisation of the Syrian Arab Republic
is to be carried out by fostering sectarian divisions, which will eventually
lead to a civil war modeled on the former Yugoslavia.
Last month, Syrian opposition militants were
dispatched to Kosovo to organize training sessions using the terrorist
expertise of the US sponsored Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in fighting the
Yugoslav armed forces.
Sherkoh Abbas, President of the US based
Kurdistan National Assembly of Syria (KNA) has,
called on Israel to support the break-up
of Syria into a series of federal structures based on the countrys
various ethnicities. (Ibid)
One possible break-up scenario pertaining to
Syria, which constitutes a secular multi-ethnic society, would be the
formation of separate and independent Sunni, Alawite-Shiite, Kurdish and
Druze states:
We need to break Syria into pieces,
Abbas said.
(Quoted in JP,
op. cit.).
The Syrian Kurdish dissident argued that a
federal Syria, separated into four or five regions on an ethnic basis,
would also serve as a natural buffer for Israel against both Sunni and
Shiite Islamist forces.
(Ibid.).
Ironically, while Islamist forces are said to
constitute the main threat to the Jewish State, Tel Aviv is providing covert
support to the Islamist Free Syrian Army (FSA).

Meeting behind Closed
Doors at the US State Department
A top level US State Department meeting was held
in May with members of the Syrian Kurdish opposition.
In attendance were representatives of the
Kurdish National Council (KNC), Robert Stephen Ford, the outgoing US
ambassador to Syria (who has played a key role in channelling support to the
rebels) as well as Frederic C. Hof, a former business partner of Richard Armitage, who currently serves as the administrations special coordinator
on Syria. (Ibid).
The delegation also met with Assistant Secretary
of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman.

The public statements of KNA leader Sherkoh
Abbas in the wake of the State Department meeting suggest that the political
fracturing of the Syrian Arab Republic along ethnic and religious lines as
well as the creation of an independent Kurdistan were discussed.
State Department Deputy Spokesman Mark
Toner described [the meeting's] purpose as part of ongoing efforts
to
help the Syrian [Kurdish] opposition build a more cohesive opposition to
Assad.
(Ibid)
The KNA leader called upon Washington to support
the creation of a separate Kurdish State consisting of,
an autonomous region in Syria; joining the
Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq - which borders the Kurdish
region in Syria; or perhaps an even larger Kurdish state [Greater
Kurdistan].
The Kurdish people, in all parts of
Kurdistan, seek the right to form an independent Kurdish state. We can
only achieve this cherished goal with the help of the western
democracies, and first and foremost the U.S. said Sherkoh Abbas.

An Alternative, Choice, Ekurd.net, May 22, 2012)
It is worth noting, in this regard, that the
creation of a Greater Kurdistan has been envisaged for several years by
the Pentagon as part of a broader Plan for Redrawing the Middle East. (See
map 2 below)
This option, which appears unlikely in the near
future, would go against the interests of Turkey, a staunch ally of both the
US and Israel.
Another scenario, which is contemplated by Ankara would
consist in the annexation to Turkey of parts of Syrian Kurdistan. (See map
above).
Greater Kurdistan would include portions of
Iran, Syria, Iraq and Turkey as conveyed in Coronel Ralph Peters (ret)
celebrated map of The New Middle East (see below).

Academy.

The New Middle East
The following map was prepared by
Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Peters.
It was published in the Armed Forces Journal in
June 2006.
Peters is a retired colonel of the U.S. National War Academy. Although the map does not officially reflect
Pentagon doctrine, it has been used in a training program at NATOs Defense
College for senior military officers.
This map, as well as other similar maps, has most probably been used at the
National War Academy as well as in military planning circles.
