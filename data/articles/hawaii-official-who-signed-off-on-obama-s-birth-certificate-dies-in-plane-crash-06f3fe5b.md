Add Loretta Fuddy to the long list of
suspicious deaths associated with President 'Lucifer' (see Steves post on
that list, here,
and "Ex-CIA
agent says Obama had Andrew Breitbart and Tom Clancy assassinated.")
Loretta Fuddy was the director of the State of
Hawaiis Department of Health.
In that capacity, Fuddy was the person who
signed off on the POSs alleged birth certificate when he, with great
fanfare on April 27, 2011, released an image of his long-form birth
certificate.
Since its release, numerous documents experts
have determined the certificate to
be a computer-generated fake.

Two days ago on December 12, 2013, a small plane
(Cessna) carrying 9 passengers crashed off the coast of Molokai.
Fuddy died at the scene. The other eight
passengers, including DOH deputy director Keith Yamamoto, all
survived with "no life-threatening injuries" and were found by the Coast
Guard floating in the water with life jackets on.
From
USA Today:
The
Hawaii health official who verified the authenticity of President
Obamas birth certificate has died in a
small plane crash, authorities said Thursday.
The plane, with a pilot and eight passengers
aboard, went down Wednesday in the water off the Hawaiian island of
Molokai, the Maui Fire Department said. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser
was among the first outlets to report that
the lone fatality was Loretta Fuddy.
Tom Matsuda, the interim executive director
of Hawaiis health insurance exchange, later confirmed Fuddys death.
Fuddy, 65,
became acting health director in January 2011. After being confirmed as
the permanent health director, Fuddy made news in April 2011 when she
verified the authenticity of certified copies of President Barack
Obamas birth certificate, proving that he had been born in Hawaii.
Obama had requested the release to curb
claims by opponents that he was born in Kenya and not eligible to be
president.
[...] The Makani Kai Air plane went down
about a half mile northwest of Kalaupapa peninsula. Makai Kai Air
President Richard Schuman says the plane was a Cessna Grand Caravan.
State Department of Health spokeswoman
Janice Okubo said the Health Departments deputy director, Keith
Yamamoto, also had been booked on the flight.
Coast Guard Petty Officer Melissa McKenzie
says a Coast Guard helicopter got 3 passengers out of the water while
Maui fire crews picked up five people. One person swam ashore.
