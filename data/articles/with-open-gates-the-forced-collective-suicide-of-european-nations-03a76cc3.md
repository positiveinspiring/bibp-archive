"With Open Gates - The forced collective suicide
of European nations", a slick, hard-hitting film about the
European migrant crisis is going viral in Europe, already
watched at least half a million times.
Although the 19-minute film may feel like a dispatch from the
future, it is cut entirely from recent news reports, police
camera footage, and interviews. Kicking off with scenes of a
modern car ferry disgorging thousands of illegals into Greece,
the film then cuts to dozens of aerial shots of columns of
migrants marching north into Europe.
The film then changed to the harrowing testimony of one young
Greek woman who was unable to hide her horror and despair at the
scale of the migrant crisis sweeping over her home island of
Lesbos.
Just six miles from the Turkish coast, the island
was subjected to migrant riots in September as newcomers turned
on their hosts for not moving them to mainland Europe fast
enough.
As Breitbart London
reported at the time, the tearful woman tells a news crew:
"We are in danger, every day, every minute.
We need someone to protect us. They come into our houses. I
want to go to work, but I can't. Our children want to go to
school, but they can't. They have stolen our lives!".
Also featured is American presidential hopeful
Donald Trump, who gives his opinion on the migrant crisis:
"I've been watching this migration, and I've
seen the people.
"I mean, these are men. They are mostly men,
and they are strong men
they look like prime time solders.
Look, Europe is going to have to handle, but they are going
to have riots in Germany.
"I always thought Merkel was a great leader,
but what she's done in Germany is insane".
The video is being rapidly shared on social media
and online message boards and has been viewed at least half a
million times, having been uploaded to platforms including
YouTube and Facebook among others dozens of times.
Although the main thrust of the film is to goad
native Europeans against mass migration and the negative effects
of multiculturalism, the film also paradoxically takes a swipe
at one European minority group who stand to lose almost the most
from mass Muslim immigration.
It also includes a short clip of
discredited, anti-Semitic politician Nick Griffin, former
Member of the European Parliament and leader of the British
National Party.
The inclusion of Mr. Griffin, an unpopular figure
even in Britain's nationalist right and the rapid success of the
film in the Netherlands suggests the film may not have been
edited by a British citizen.
Breitbart London
has reported at length on the rising tide of anti-Semitism in
Europe which has arrived with mass migration.
In below video, the editor warns:
"This video will not be online long, download
and mirror it while you can".
"At current immigration levels and
disappearing birth rates native Europeans are destined to
become a minority in their own countries within decades.
This is already the case for many of Europe's largest
cities."
"Millions of young Muslim men leave behind
their family, pay thousands to criminal traffickers to reach
the land they have been promised by European politicians
illegally.
Dubbed by the media as 'refugees', they cross
through 6-10 safe countries to reach wealthy nations like
Germany or Sweden where they hope to receive a better life
at the expense of the taxpayer.
Only a fraction of them are Syrian, as they
enter unfiltered, without any documents and without any
legitimate right to claim asylum. Women and children are
rarely seen, except in the cherry-picked sob stories of the
media".
At the end of the lengthy call to arms, the
writer concludes:
"We are still at a point where you will not
get imprisoned for your political opinion in most European
countries, but this will change very soon.
Do not be
apathetic, do not be weak. Be someone that can be proud to
call himself European".
