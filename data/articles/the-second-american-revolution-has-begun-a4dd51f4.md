There's a sense of desperation in America today.
Their jobs are being exported out of the
country, their health insurance is being dropped by employers, their dollars
are becoming increasingly worthless with each passing day and their futures
don't look very promising. They're angry, frustrated and desperate, so they
take to the streets and protest.
Occupy Wall Street! Occupy The Fed! Take to
the streets!
It's the right thing to do, but what most protesters - and nearly all
Americans - don't fully grasp is that nearly every powerful institution is a
criminal racket.
It's not just Wall Street that's operated like a criminal
mob, folks:
-
It's the U.S. Congress
-
It's the health care industry
-
It's conventional agriculture, the
mainstream media, the processed food manufacturers, the government
regulators and of course the entire
military industrial complex
Nearly everything around you is a criminal
operation.
-
The
banks openly steal your homes while
laundering money for global drug lords
-
The U.S. government runs illegal
guns into Mexico while allowing cocaine and heroin back into the USA to be
sold at pumped-up black market prices
-
The
mainstream media broadcasts
outright lies and complete fabrications as if they were fact
-
Much of modern
medical "science" is complete quackery or fiction, funded by corporations
for the purpose of expanding corporate power
-
The local water supply is intentionally
contaminated with
toxic poisons known as "fluoride"
-
The local food supply is tainted with
other dangerous chemicals like
aspartame, MSG and BPA
Your local hospital is almost certainly involved in a medical racket that
seeks to insert high-profit medical procedure charges onto patient bills,
and your local nursing home most likely throws granny in the hospital for a
few days in order to get triple billing from Medicare upon their return.
Doctors prescribe antibiotics because they get kickbacks from
the drug
companies, and the medical journals are little more than science whores who
have been bought and paid for by the pharmaceutical industry.
And don't forget
vaccines, which have become the
pathway through which infectious disease is actually spread among the
population
using live viruses injected into innocent
children.
Wake the heck up, people! Most of modern society is a giant con.
Nearly
every institution, every mega corporation, every government and nearly every
politician or bureaucrat is really just a criminal mobster trying to steal
your wealth or gain control over your actions and thoughts.
Most institutions actually cause the very things
they claim to be fighting against!
Why does the cancer
industry promote cancer?
-
The
cancer industry actually promotes cancer,
didn't you know?
-
The
DEA runs drugs!
-
The ATF
runs guns
-
The
FDA keeps deadly drugs legal while
trying to outlaw safe, affordable natural remedies
-
The
EPA openly allows deadly toxic
chemicals to be dumped into the environment (like mercury fillings
from dental offices)
-
The
CDC actually promotes complete
falsehoods about infectious disease in order to scare people into
thinking everybody needs to get vaccinated
-
The
vaccines are intentionally contaminated
with live viruses in order to spread disease and make the CDC look
even more important!
Meanwhile, the President is actively destroying
the economic base of America, aided by feds who threaten business owners
like
Gibson Guitars which are only trying to manufacture quality
American-made products.
The purpose of all this? To destroy America's
economy from the inside out. It is intentional. It is being engineered.
The U.S.
economy is supposed to collapse by
design, get it? Beyond the economy alone, the entire "war
on terror" is a complete and utter hoax, having been fabricated
from the very start by government insiders.
From
9/11 to present-day terror, it has all been a pathetic and
cowardly string of fabrications and staged events for the sole purpose of
destroying freedom in America.
Most of what you're
told from "official" sources is flat-out false
Are you getting this? Nearly everything you've been told is a lie.
Everything you hear on the mainstream news is
either a complete fabrication or a wild distortion of reality. And the
things you don't hear on the evening news are the things that really matter
- things like the fact that your money is being quietly stolen from you by
the Federal Reserve.
Nearly everything you are told by the White House, or the FDA, or the EPA -
or any government regulator - is a complete and total lie.
There is no room
for truth in a system of outright tyrannical lawbreaking. That's what we
have today instead of government: A cabal of criminal thugs who operate with
impunity while violating laws with complete disregard for human rights or
the Bill of Rights.
Did you know, for example, that the
Obama administration runs a secret death
panel that decides which Americans to add to a "kill list?" This
kill list
is then handed over to the President who decides which Americans to simply
assassinate or murder.
Think I'm making this up? Then why was it
openly reported by Reuters?
Watch this astonishing
interaction between ABC News reporter
Jake Trapper and White House Spokesperson
Carney, who completely excuses the
Obama administration's outright murder of an American citizen with
absolutely zero evidence, no due process, no trial and no proper legal
justification whatsoever:
Why things are the way they are
- the honest truth
-
Do you wonder why so many people are
sick and diseased today? Because the health care system is
designed
to make you sick!
-
Do you wonder why so many people are
bankrupt today? Because
the financial system is designed to keep you
bankrupt!
-
Do you wonder why voters have so little
power versus the corporations today? Because the political system is
designed to keep the corporations in power while
keeping you
enslaved.
-
Do you wonder why you are still paying
$3 or $4 per gallon of gas? Because the energy industry is designed
to keep you enslaved to high-profit energy sources while oppressing
free energy technology.
-
Do you ever wonder why the best
innovations in medicine, free energy and
human consciousness are
always suppressed? Because the system is designed to destroy or
censor any technologies that would lend themselves to longevity,
freedom or increased awareness.
-
Do you wonder why America remains in
perpetual war with an unseen enemy? Because the whole system is
designed to operate in
a state of perpetual warfare so that the
people can be kept in a state of constant fear while being denied
their freedoms.
Join the revolution
This is why I invite you to join the revolution in whatever constructive way
you can.
Now is the time to make your voice heard, just as all those
protesting right now are doing.
My only bit of wisdom to pass along in this regard is to make sure it's your
OWN voice and don't let yourself be played by some organized globalist
agenda that now wants to hijack the protests for their own nefarious
purposes.
The essence of freedom is,
YES, the globalist bankers are crooks.
They probably deserve to be strung up
in a public square somewhere, but even such actions should never be taken
without due process and a proper trial. What's really wrong with America
today is that the criminal elements are running the show, from the White
House to Wall Street.
And it's time the People demanded that EVERYONE
abide by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
After all,
The revolution happening right now is a
revolution borne out of frustration, and although it seems to lack focus in
the mixed messages heard on the street right now, it will soon coalesce into
a call for justice and an end to the systems of tyranny that dominate the
American landscape today.
The transition out of freedom and justice will be fraught with violence, I
fear, and there will soon be
Martial Law declared across our land. Be
prepared for what's coming, and have no illusions that the second American
revolution is now at our doorstep.
I only ask:
