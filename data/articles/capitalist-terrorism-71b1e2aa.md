Cabal capitalists are terrorists in the same sense that any other terrorist
group is:
they engage in violent or life-threatening acts that are a
violation of the criminal laws of the State and are intended to intimidate
or coerce the civilian population, to influence the policy of the government
by intimidation or coercion, and to affect the conduct of a government by
mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping. 1
Cabal capitalists have pulled off a second 9/11 terrorist attack
- a
financial assault on American workers and the American economy!
A repeat of
the 1929 economic crash.
Capitalists are incessantly perpetrating terrorist
outrages:
Worker victims suffer unemployment, poverty, and loss
of homes, retirement, and medical insurance.
Behind capitalist terrorists stand:
Workers thus far have only been able to protest, but through understanding
capitalist terrorism we'll be able to struggle against it in many ways.
The diabolical feature of this second 9/11 terrorist attack is that the
cabal has been able to make it invisible - disguising it as an accidental
collapse of Wall Street and the U.S. economy, in keeping with their strategy
of creating a fantasy reality.
The cabal was able to make the 2000 election
coup d'etat invisible - making the public delusively believe:
-
that Bush won
the election fairly
-
that the invasion and occupation of Iraq was a
legitimate war - when it's in reality a for-profit scam
-
that the Patriot
Act was a necessary way to insure domestic security - when in fact the cabal
was viciously attacking Constitutional liberties
So the "financial
meltdown" has been made to appear as a mere accident brought on by bad
mortgages and a housing slump that will ultimately be "solved" by giving
more billions in tax-payer dollars to cabal financial institutions.
The cabal has been able to keep this 9/11 economic terrorist attack
"invisible" because they earlier devastated the minds of U.S. workers
through deliberate mis-education, so Americans don't actually see how
they're being decimated by economic, political, and social terrorist
tactics. They've become literally blind to reality.
Because of this cabal economic terrorist attack, the
American and world
economy has already collapsed - though few people are able to see the
reality - so befuddled by the cabal's Fabulous Financial Fraud are they.
The world economic smashup will ultimately become apparent - because workers'
loss of homes, jobs, and retirement - and the hunger of their families - will
finally force them to pay attention to their plight. Already, 30% of
Americans are living in poverty, with 30 million receiving food stamps.
Ultimately, workers can't ignore destitution and starvation. And then, these
awakened victims of capitalist terrorism will rise up worldwide against
their moneyed overlords and take back their nations, instituting governments
for the people.
Through its current 9/11 economic terrorist attack the demonic cabal intends
to destroy the American and world economic system utterly - and the common
people with it. They've already seized over $7.4 trillion dollars (as
revealed by Bloomberg News), which represents 65% of U.S. gross domestic
product (GDP).
In the real world - not this fantasy world the cabal has
constructed - spending over about 5% of GDP would be disastrous to a genuine
economy.
This makes it clear that the cabal intends to steal over 100% of
GDP, bringing the American and world economy to utter wreckage. Cabal
insiders will have
seized their billions and from the devastated financial
and industrial rubble that remains they'll buy what assets they want for
pennies on the dollar.
When such wreckage and desolation occur, it will likely be necessary for the
cabal to impose martial law in America, using the military units that have
recently been deployed to the U.S. for just this purpose. America will
experience precisely what Germany did in the 1930s - runaway inflation and
social-political-economic devastation - and a new totally dictatorial regime
will be the outcome - again.
Workers worldwide must wake up to how capitalist terrorists are literally
destroying them day in and day out. It's often difficult for Americans to
believe that their rulers are as ruthless and pitiless as they really
are - and hence clearly deserve the name terrorists.
It may help to see one
of the cabal terrorists in action, in this instance Marie Jana Korbelov√°,
aka Madeliene Albright, 64th American Secretary of State in response to a
question about 1990s U.S. economic sanctions against Iraq and the human
consequences:
Question: "We have heard that half a million children have died. I mean,
that's more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price
worth it?"
Reply: "I think this is a very hard choice, but the price
- we think the price
is worth it."
Albright is no more barbarous in her behavior and attitudes than any other
of her cabal fellow terrorists.
Financial terrorism such as imposing
economic sanctions against a state the junta chooses is one of their
favorite tactics - regardless of human consequences.
Often, people are able to comprehend current events when they see that
they're in essence a repeat of earlier occurrences. In this essay, we'll
explore the identical features of the 1929 economic crash and the 2008
capitalist terrorist attack on the world economy.
Both in 1929 and again now, people find it difficult to understand that
seemingly accidental events - like economic crashes - are in reality planned
and orchestrated by totally unscrupulous persons with immense power.
"The Crash was not accidental. It was a carefully contrived occurrence. The
international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so
that they might emerge as rulers of us all."
Republican Congressman, Louis T. McFadden
Chairman of the House Banking &
Currency Committee from 1920 to 1931
"The October 2008 financial meltdown is not the result of a cyclical
economic phenomenon. It is the deliberate result of US government policy
instrumented through the Treasury and the US Federal Reserve Board.
"This is the most serious economic crisis in World history.
"The 'bailout' proposed by the US Treasury does not constitute a 'solution'
to the crisis. In fact quite the opposite: it is the cause of further
collapse. It triggers an unprecedented concentration of wealth, which in
turn contributes to widening economic and social inequalities both within
and between nations."
Michel Chossudovsky
"Who are the Architects of Economic Collapse?"
In examining the many forms of terrorism that the predatory cabal members
perpetrate unremittingly and globally, we must be clear that their violence,
annihilation, and ruthlessness is endemic to capitalism - not merely an
accidental and infrequent accompaniment.
We cannot rid ourselves of the
scourge of "free-market" terrorism by retaining any form of capitalism.
In this regard, Naomi Klein's book Shock Doctrine represents an attempt to
criticize the terrorism of capitalism - and then take it all back by claiming
that a nice, cleaned-up, sanitized form of Keynesian capitalism would be an
economic utopia.
Klein presents, she says, a,
"challenge to the central and most cherished
claim in the official story - that the triumph of deregulated capitalism has
been born of freedom, that unfettered markets go hand in hand with
democracy."
Instead, she claims to,
"show that this fundamental form of
capitalism has consistently been midwifed by the most brutal forms of
coercion."
Klein claims that it's not necessary to rid ourselves of the capitalist
profit system - that such rejection would represent extremism similar to that
which characterizes the doctrinaire free market ideology.
Klein recommends
returning to so-called Keynesian strategies employed during the post-World
War II boom: deficit-spending, intervention, and regulation.
"I am not arguing that all forms of market systems are inherently violent.
It is eminently possible to have a market-based economy that requires no
such brutality and demands no such ideological purity. A free market in
consumer products can coexist with free public health care, with public
schools, with a large segment of the economylike a national oil
companyheld in state hands.
It is possible to require corporations to pay
decent wages, to respect the rights of workers to form unions, and for
governments to tax and redistribute wealth so that the sharp inequalities
that mark the corporatist state are reduced. Markets need not be
fundamentalist.
"Keynes proposed exactly that kind of mixed, regulated economy after the
Great Depression, a revolution in public policy that created the New Deal
and transformations like it round the world. It was exactly that system of
compromises, checks and balances that Friedmans counterrevolution was
launched to methodically dismantle in country after country."
Klein and her ilk are what I call eupho-capitalists, persons who have a
vague awareness of the intrinsic corruption and depravity of capitalism, but
believe they can clean up the "market system" and save it from its own
excesses and excrescences.
The proof that Klein's idea of a sanitized capitalism ultimately doesn't
work was provided by Franklin D. Roosevelt's attempt to save capitalism from
its Robber-Baron excesses. He put into effect such progressive elements as
Social Security, the Glass-Steagall Act, and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation. But it wasn't long before the cabal began to dismantle most of
what FDR had done and came roaring back with a new type of cannibalistic
capitalism.
Scholastics such as Klein live in a fantasy-world in which the American
people rule and can therefore select whatever kind of "market-based economy"
they want: one "that requires no such brutality and no such ideological
purity."
In the real world of geopolitical factuality, America is brutally
manhandled by a demonic cabal that does what it wants - including the current
economic 9/11, part II, terrorist attack.
Klein recognizes that economic idiots like Milton Friedman and his
conservative confreres such as Greenspan, soon changed the economic
landscape into the capitalist terrorism nightmare we now suffer.
Like so
many current daydreamers, Klein has evidently been taken in by
the cabal's
slick propaganda swindle that President-Elect Obama is a reincarnated FDR or
Lincoln come to save the people from the evil Wall Street hippogriffs and
create a Keynesian economic New Millennium.
Unfortunately, there are many Americans who suffer from these
cabal-induced
delusions.
"Barack Husein Obama is a reflection of our collective consciousness. Our
(His) ability to navigate to a better place is dependent on our collective
will... We can not tell Obama what to do but we can energetically
influence the outcome. We can elevate the vibration to a higher frequency
and picture wholeness. We can usher in a new reality by thinking it into
existence." 3
Part of the reason for so stark an essay as this on capitalist terrorism is
to help Americans wake up who are now suffering from the post-2008 election
hangover of ivory-towered expectations and delusions.
We must work in every
way possible to expose and defeat the terrorist cabal, laboring
intelligently to institute a true commonwealth polity for the benefit of all
citizens.
"The money power preys upon the nation in times of peace and conspires
against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than monarchy, more
insolent than autocracy, more selfish than bureaucracy. I see in the near
future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for
the safety of my country.
Corporations have been enthroned, an era of
corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country
will endeavor to prolong its REIGN by working upon the prejudices of the
people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is
destroyed."
President Abraham Lincoln
after the National Banking Act of 1863 was passed
