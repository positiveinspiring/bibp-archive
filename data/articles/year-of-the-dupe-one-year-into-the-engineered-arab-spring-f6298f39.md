Al Arabiya News reported in their article,
"Tunisian exiled reformist to head back home," that Moncef Marzouki was
returning to Tunisia (from Paris) amidst the chaos sown by US State
Department trained, supported, and equipped mobs
who were "triggered" by
the convenient release of US State Department cables via WikiLeaks.
Quite clearly, considering the training
Tunisian opposition groups received long before the cables were
released, the WikiLeaks cables were merely used as a planned rhetorical
justification for long ago premeditated foreign-funded sedition.
Since then, WikiLeaks has been
employed in
an identical manner everywhere from Egypt to Libya, and even as far
flung as Thailand.
Moncef Marzouki, it would turn out,
was founder and head of the Arab
Commission for Human Rights, a collaborating institution with the US NED
World Movement for Democracy (WMD) including for a "Conference on Human
Rights Activists in Exile" and a participant in the WMD "third assembly"
alongside Marzouki's Tunisian League for Human Rights,
sponsored by NED,
Soros' Open Society, and USAID.
A "call for solidarity" by the International Federation for Human Rights
(FIDH) mentions by name each and every group constituting the Tunisian
opposition during the "uprising" in January 2011 as "FIDH member
organizations."
These include Marzouki's "Tunisian League
for Human Rights," the "Tunisian Association of Democratic Women," and
the "National Council for Liberties in Tunisia," or CNLT.
FIDH, acting as an international nexus for
various foreign-funded organizations carrying out sedition worldwide
under the guise of "human rights," is
itself fully funded by the US
government through the National Endowment for Democracy, Soros' Open
Society, and many others with clearly compromised affiliations.

After a warning by journalist/activist Dr.
Webster Tarpley of
World Crisis Radio, the alternative media began
looking closer at the unrest in Egypt which began shortly after
Tunisia's growing crisis.
In "All is not what it seems in Egyptian
Clashes," it was noted that protest leader Mohammed ElBaradei was in
fact a devoted agent of the West, with a
long standing membership within
the Wall Street/London funded International Crisis Group (ICG) along
side "senior Israeli officials" including the current Israeli President
Shimon Peres, the current Governor of the Bank of Israel, Stanley
Fischer, and former Israeli Foreign Minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami.
The ICG also includes
senior American
bankers and geopolitical manipulators including,
Photo: ElBaradei's ties to the West go much deeper
than merely
play-acting within the ineffectual, genocide-enabling UN.
He is also a member of
the corporate-financier funded International Crisis Group.
Ironically, Western media outlets insisted
ElBaradei was both anti-American and strongly anti-Israeli in a rouse
best described a year earlier in March 2010 in the Council On Foreign
Relations' paper, Foreign Affairs' article "Is ElBaradei Egypt's Hero?":
"Further, Egypts close relationship
with the United States has become a critical and negative factor in
Egyptian politics. The opposition has used these ties to
delegitimize the regime, while the government has engaged in its own
displays of anti-Americanism to insulate itself from such charges.
If ElBaradei actually has a reasonable
chance of fostering political reform in Egypt, then U.S.
policymakers would best serve his cause by not acting strongly.
Somewhat paradoxically, ElBaradeis chilly relationship with the
United States as IAEA chief only advances U.S. interests now."
The most recent manifestation of this came
when Israel farcically called ElBaradei
an "Iranian agent."
This latest performance further illustrates
the immense level of duplicity with which world events are being
manipulated.
February 17, 2011
The London-based National Front for the
Salvation of Libya (NFSL) calls for a Libyan "Day of Rage" to match the
US-destabilization rhetoric used in Tunisia and Egypt.
The NFSL has been
backed by the CIA-MI6
since the 80's and had made multiple attempts to overthrow Qaddafi's
government with both terrorist attacks and armed insurrection.
Please note the "EnoughGaddafi.com"
signs.

Department's

February 18, 2011
In the wake of Honsi Mubarak's ousting,
billionaire bankster George Soros' Open Society Institute was found to
be behind NGOs
drafting Egypt's new constitution.
These "civil society" groups include the
Arabic Network for Human Rights Information openly funded by George
Soros' Open Society Institute and the Neo-Con lined NED funded
Egyptian
Organization for Human Rights.
It appears that while the International
Crisis Group was turning out the strategy, and their trustee ElBaradei
leading the mobs into the streets, it is the vast array of NGOs their
membership, including Soros, fund that were working out and implementing
the details on the ground.
February 21, 2011
An
interview with Ibrahim Sahad of the
National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL) on ABC Australia,
featured every talking point covered by the mainstream corporate media
from previous weeks regarding Libya, all with the White House and
Washington Monument looming over him in the background.
He made calls for a no-fly zone in reaction
to unsubstantiated accusations Qaddafi was strafing "unarmed protesters"
with warplanes.
March 2011's "US Libyan Policy: Zero Legitimacy," noted the clearly
heavily armed, western-backed insurgency that was still being
disingenuously portrayed by Western media as "peaceful protests."
February 28, 2011
"Destroying Libya" stated:
While Libyan opposition leader Ibrahim Sahad leads the rhetorical charge
from Washington D.C., his National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL)
on the ground is armed to the teeth, as it has been throughout its 20
year history of attempted CIA backed rebellions against Qaddafi. In
1984, the NFSL tried to overthrow Qaddafi in a failed armed coup.
The Daily Globe and Mail also recently
confirmed that the NFSL along with the Libyan National Army, both under
Sahad's new National Conference of Libyan Opposition (NCLO), had both,
"attempted coups and assassinations
against Col. Gadhafi in the 1980s."
Already at this point, both British
and US
representatives were admitting Libyan rebels were indeed heavily armed,
and instead of condemning the violence, openly called for
additional
weapons and military support to be provided.
March 17, 2011
The UN decided to enforce a
no-fly zone over
Libya to save the globalist-backed rebellion
sputtering in failure and
bordering on a "Bay of Pigs" disaster.
Canadian, US, French, Arab, and UK jets were
already reported to
be preparing for the operation.
March 24, 2011
Unrest had already begun in Syria, as NATO
began bombing Libya while Egypt and Tunisia had already fallen into
political and economic chaos.
In "Globalists Hit in Syria," the opposition
is closely examined and documented to be once again a creation of
Western-backed opposition groups.
Much of the "evidence" of Syria's unrest was being filtered through
organizations such as the London-based Syrian Human-Rights Committee
whose hearsay statements posted on its website
were cited by corporate
news media in outlandish reports of violence that also include
"activists say" after each allegation.
The "Syrian Observatory for Human Rights,"
also London-based, is now the exclusive source cited by corporate-media
reports regarding Syria.
March 26, 2011
In Egypt, signs of a counterrevolution and
the
first signs of weakness in ElBaradei's chances to be installed as
president began to show. Mobs pelted ElBaradei with rocks calling him
"an American agent."
WikiLeaks would again come to the aid of US
interests and try to reintroduce the "anti-Western" image ElBaradei had
been hamfisted in portraying.
The "barrier of
legitimacy" is broken: a mob shouts "American agent"
as they hurl rocks at
ElBaradei who most certainly is
an American agent - a
trustee of the US International Crisis Group alongside George Soros.
March 28, 2011
Fortune-500 funded Brookings Institution's
"Libya's Test of the New International Order" is reported on - exposing
the war as not one of a "humanitarian" nature, but one aimed explicitly
at establishing an international order and the primacy of international
law.
Red = US-backed
destabilization, Blue = US occupying/stationed.
China's oil and sea
access to the Middle East and Africa are being or have already been cut.
A similar strategy of
isolation was used on Japan just before the onset of World War II.
April 17, 2011
Syria's unrest yields widespread arson as
well as reports of gunmen targeting both protesters and state security
forces in a bid to escalate violence. In, "Globalist War Machine Fixates
on Syria," the "Libyan Precedent" is already being cited by US and
French politicians as justification to use force against Syria.
A later article, "Color Revolution's Mystery
Gunmen," establishes a historical context within which to view the
current violence in Syria and the fact that it is provocateurs sowing
much of the violence.
April 21, 2011
Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko
announces that his nation is now also under covert attack by Western
forces to foster an "Arab Spring-style" insurrection.
In, "Besieging Belarus," documented ties
between Belarus opposition members and the same Western organizations
and institutions fueling the Arab Spring are illustrated.
April 22, 2011
John McCain
touches down in Benghazi, Libya
and consorts with verified terrorists who were fresh back from Iraq and
Afghanistan, killing US troops.
A West Point report would later confirm
(report
from West Point's CTC can be
found here) with absolute certainty that
the region from which the Libyan rebellion began was also the Libyan
Islamic Fighting Group's (LIFG) center of operations. It would also
expose the fact that LIFG were in fact long-time affiliates of Al Qaeda
with LIFG members occupying the highest levels of leadership within the
terrorist organization.
Ultimate act of
treason: McCain calls for recognition and extra-legal support
for the very men who had
killed US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
By denying "Al-Qaeda" a
base in Iraq, but handing them the entire nation of Libya,
he has brought American
foreign policy
to a new level of surrealism.
May, 2011
In "Libya at Any Cost," the conflict in
Libya was reported to be escalating, including NATO attempts to
assassinate Qaddafi and the targeted killings of several of his family
members including several of his grandchildren.
"America's Arab Deception" attempted to review the past several months
of engineered chaos blowing through Northern Africa and the Middle East,
while it was noted in, "You Can't Make This Stuff Up," that the National
Endowment for Democracy already began its first round of
self-aggrandizing, and passing out awards to several of the dupes and
collaborators that made its campaign of carnage throughout the Arab
World a reality.
June, 2011
In "Arab Spring brings Corporate Locust,"
the true agenda behind Egypt's, and indeed the entire "Arab Spring's"
unrest became apparent as US representatives gave Fortune 500 executives
a tour of destabilized Egypt and Tunisia in an effort to promote
economic liberalization and privatization.
John McCain and John Kerry led the tour and
had co-sponsored bills to promote what would essentially be the meshing
of Egypt and Tunisia's economy into the Wall Street/London international
order.
McCain (left) and
Kerry (right) gesticulate as they explain their paymaster's agenda
within the confines of an
Egyptian Coca-Cola factory.
This is part of their
latest trip surveying the effects
of their US-funded
opposition overthrowing Hosni Mubarak's government.
In late June, France would admit to
violating the terms of UN resolution 1973, and arming Libyan rebels.
July, 2011
The African Union would wholly reject the
International Criminal Court's mandate against Libya, exposing the
severe illegitimacy with which it operates.
Ties to corporate-financier funded
organizations are revealed in "It's Official: International Criminal
Court has ZERO Mandate," as well as the tenuous nature of the ICC's
claims against Libya's Qaddafi. It would later be confirmed by members
of Libya's "human rights" community that indeed they, in collaboration
with the rebel leaders, fabricated the numbers supplied to both the UN
and the ICC, and that no verified or documented evidence of Qaddafi's
"atrocities" were produced.
In Thailand, another long-running US-backed color revolution finally
yielded results and saw the return of Wall Street proxy, Thaksin
Shinawatra's political party to power.
Various mouthpieces of the global elite,
including the Council on Foreign Relations itself,
gave stern warnings
to Thailand's establishment to accept the tenuous results of the July
election or face isolation and other consequences.
Another Southeast Asian country, Malaysia
would also see color revolution take to their streets - this time in
Malaysia by the yellow-clad, NED-funded Bersih movement.
Thaksin Shinawatra,
a long time servant of the global elite, since before even
becoming Thailand's prime
minister in 2001, reports to the CFR in New York City
on the eve of the 2006
military coup that ousted him from power.
He has now returned to
power in Thailand via a proxy political party led by his own sister,
Yingluck Shinawatra.
Securing the votes of
only 35% of eligible voters puts on full display
how tenuous his support
really is within a nation he claims stands entirely behind him.
August, 2011
By August, even the corporate-media began
admitting that Syria's opposition was "mostly unarmed," or in other
words, armed. The opposition was starting to be more clearly defined as
armed ethnic groups and armed militants of the Muslim Brotherhood.
By late August, NATO began a coordinated attack on Tripoli, Libya,
involving an elaborate psychological-operation that claimed to have
eliminated or captured the entire Qaddafi family in a single day.
The following day, Saif Al-Qaddafi would
turn up alive and well, and free, while leading fierce fighting that
would carry on until October and result in NATO leveling the cities of
Bani Walid and Sirte in particular, into piles of rubble.
It had become entirely clear that NATO was
providing air support not for democracy-loving freedom fighters, but for
hardcore terrorists who were carrying out a
systematic campaign of
genocide and reprisals throughout the country.
Libya's rebels are
far from motivated by democratic aspirations.
Their grievances lie
along ethnic, not political divides.
"Gaddafi supporters" is
the euphemism being used by the global corporate-media
in describing the
generally darker skinned and African tribes that form
the majority of
Western Libya's demographics and who are
bearing the brunt of
NATO-backed rebel atrocities.
September, 2011
Sensing victory in Libya,
corporate-financier funded think-tanks began preparing for the
rebuilding and despoiling of the Libyan economy. In "Globalists to
Rebuild Libya," NATO's Atlantic Council wrote a report detailing just
how they would go about doing this.
Also as Libya's violence spiraled out of control and atrocities carried
out by the rebels and their NATO backers became more obscene, it became
clear how fraudulent the "War on Terror" was.
In "Libyan Rebels Listed by US State
Department as Terrorists," it is illustrated how NATO members were
guilty of anti-terrorist laws for providing material support for listed
terrorist organizations.
A screenshot taken
directly from the
US State Department website
showing the Libyan
Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) clearly listed as a foreign terrorist
organization.
This is important, as US
Code prohibits providing material support to listed terrorist
organizations.
With revelations of Al
Qaeda and LIFG fighters leading the Libyan rebellion
with NATO-members' full
military, financial, and diplomatic support,
attempts are being made
to plea ignorance as to the true nature of the rebels.
Listed below LIFG, is MEK,
an Iraqi/Iranian group also being armed and supported by the US.
September also saw real humanitarian
catastrophe unfold in Uganda, where a British corporation sanctioned
genocide to clear land they had "leased" from the Ugandan government.
Thus illustrates how the cause of
"humanitarian concerns" is called on only when it serves Wall Street and
London's interests, and otherwise ignored when it involves verifiable
genocide carried out in the pursuit of furthering their wealth and
power.
Robert Devereux, a
long time investor, a long time con-artist spinning
his company's despoiling
of Africa as some sort of cutting-edge investment strategy that makes
money and "helps" people.
Even as Devereux made his
disingenuous statements in 2010 regarding New Forests,
the villagers in Uganda
he was "helping" had already filed a court case a year earlier
protesting the British
company's encroachment on their land.
These villagers would be
forcibly displaced,
many of them killed by
Ugandan troops acting on behalf of Devereux.
John McCain would land once again in Libya,
this time in Tripoli to celebrate the destruction of the country and
shake hands once again with the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group that
delivered Qaddafi's Libya into the hands of the Wall Street/London
elite.
It's all smiles
and laughs in Tripoli as McCain, a chief proponent
and driving force behind
the US intervention in Libya, literally glorifies Al Qaeda's exploits in
the now ruined nation.
Miles away, the very
rebels he was praising are purposefully starving
the civilian population
of Sirte in an effort to break their will,
while they and NATO
indiscriminately use heavy weapons aimed at crowded city centers.
October 2011
While Tunisia and Egypt had fallen, and
Libya too being seized by proxy forces fueled by the West, the Obama
administration began withdrawing troops from Iraq.
This suspicious withdrawal when otherwise
the rest of the Middle East was under US proxy assault raised serious
suspicions that an escalation, not retreat was to follow.
Rhetoric for war with Iran had been steadily increasing and the
beginning of what looked like a covert war was being fought inside and
along Iran's borders.
A disastrous ploy of framing Iran for the
alleged planned assassination of a Saudi ambassador in Washington D.C.
fell apart when Iranians linked the plot to US-backed terrorist
organization Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK).
MEK. Admittedly a
terrorist organization, listed by the US State Department
as being such, it is
fully funded, armed, and backed by the United States,
based in France and
US-occupied Iraq, and allowed to conduct
terrorist operations
against the Iranian people.
The "War on Terror" is a
fraud.
It is more than likely that the withdrawal
of troops from Iraq would simply provide the US "plausible deniability"
for an Israeli airstrike on Iran.
November 2011
Syria's "peaceful protesters" who had been
all along fully armed and attempting to stoke a Libyan-style civil war,
were finally acknowledge as such by the corporate-media and more
importantly by the corporate-funded think-tanks that supply them with
their talking points.
In "IISS: Syria's Opposition is Armed," it
is states that
a report out of the International Institute for Strategic
Studies by Senior Fellow for Regional Security at IISS-Middle East,
Emile Hokayem openly admitted that Syria's opposition was armed and
prepared to drag Syria's violence into even bloodier depths.
Also in November, Wall Street and London's assault on Libya came full
circle with the installation of Abdurrahim el-Keib as prime minister.
El-Keib who spent decades in exile in the
US, was formally employed by the Petroleum Institute, based in Abu
Dhabi, UAE
and sponsored by British Petroleum (BP), Shell, France's
Total, the Japan Oil Development Company, and the Abu Dhabi National Oil
Company.
And so begins the
farce that is Western "democracy."
One corporate-fascist
puppet Mahmoud Jibril , steps down, another, Abdurrahim el-Keib, takes his place.
In
reality, it is NATO-states and their corporate sponsors that now determine
Libya's fate.
Pictured above, el-Keib poses with Mustafa Abdul-Jalil,
chairman of the
unelected, NATO-backed "National Transitional Council."
Joining el-Keib would be
US-funded activist, Moncef Marzouki, named Tunisia's president. Marzouki's organization, the
Tunisian League for Human Rights,
was a US National Endowment for
Democracy and George Soros Open Society-funded International Federation
for Human Rights (FIDH) member organization.
Marzouki, who spent two decades in exile in
Paris, France, was also founder and head of the Arab Commission for
Human Rights, a collaborating institution with the US NED World
Movement for Democracy (WMD) including for a "Conference on Human
Rights Activists in Exile" and a participant in the WMD "third assembly"
alongside Marzouki's Tunisian League for Human Rights,
sponsored by NED,
Soros' Open Society, and USAID.
US NED-funded activist leader Moncef Marzouki after spending two
decades in Paris,
helps foist the facade of
"democracy" onto the Tunisian people.
Of course, he, or someone
of equal servitude to the West was going to become "President."
In 1993
Noam Chomsky
would concisely describe the work of NED as
"an attempt to impose
what is called democracy, meaning rule by the rich and the powerful,
without interference by
the mob but within the framework of formal electoral procedures."
In other words, those
fighting in the "Arab Spring" did so for gilded tyranny.
In Egypt, in late November, a second
"revolution" began unfolding on the streets.
In reality it was the same Western-backed
forces led by ElBaradei and the emerging Mamdouh Hamza, against Egyptian
military forces that seemed to have gone back on whatever arrangements
they made with the West after the fall of Mubarak.
The UN, in another attempt to escalate foreign intervention in Syria,
would release a UN Human Rights Council report regarding Syrian "crimes
against humanity" which was actually co-authored by Karen Koning AbuZayd,
a director of the US Washington-based corporate think-tank, Middle East
Policy Council, that includes Exxon men, CIA agents, US military and
government representatives, and even the president of the US-Qatar
Business Council,
which includes amongst its membership, AlJazeera,
Chevron, Exxon, munitions manufacturer Raytheon (who supplied the
opening salvos during NATO's operations against Libya), and Boeing.
The report itself contained no verifiable evidence, but rather hearsay
accounts recorded in Geneva by alleged "victims" "witnesses," and
"defectors," put forth by "all interested persons and organizations." In
other words, it was an open invitation for Syria's enemies to paint
whatever image of the ruling government they pleased.
December 2011
With Tunisia and Libya fully run by Western
proxies, Egypt and Syria still mired in chaos, and with globalists
calling for war on Iran, the "Arab Spring" was nearly complete.
However, the "Arab Spring" was only the
first leg of a grander strategy to encircle Russia and China. In
December, the campaigns to move in on Russia and China would begin in
earnest.
The "String of
Pearls:"
China's oil lifeline is to be cut
by the destabilization
and regimes changes being made throughout Africa and the Middle East.
Along the "String" the US
has been destabilizing nations from Pakistan to Myanmar,
from Malaysia to
Thailand, to disrupt and contain China's emergence as a regional power.
Hillary Clinton, in Foreign Policy Magazine
would pen, "America's Pacific Century," a Hitlerian declaration of
imperial intent for American "leadership" in Asia for the next 100
years.
From "Hillary Clinton and the New American
(Pacific) Century":
"Upon reading Clinton's declaration of
intent for American leadership into the next century, readers may
recall the similarly named, ranting "Project for a New American
Century" signed off on by some of America's most notorious
Neo-Conservatives, which almost verbatim made the same case now made
by Clinton.
In fact, America's evolving confrontation with China,
marked acutely by Obama's announcement of a permanent US military
presence in Australia just this week, is torn directly from the
pages of decades old blueprints drawn up by corporate-financier
funded think-tanks that truly rule America and its destiny.
As reported in June, 2011's "Collapsing
China," as far back as 1997 there was talk about developing an effective
containment strategy coupled with the baited hook of luring China into
its place amongst the "international order."
Just as in these 1997 talking-points where
author and notorious Neo-Con policy maker Robert Kagan described the
necessity of using America's Asian "allies" as part of this containment
strategy, Clinton goes through a list of regional relationships the US
is trying to cultivate to maintain "American leadership" in Asia.
For example, the recently reinstalled Wall Street proxy regime in
Thailand led by Thaksin Shinawatra and his sister Yingluck, has received
reassurances by Clinton herself just this week stating that,
"it is in the national security and
political interest of the United States to have this government
succeed."
As reported in-depth in "CONFIRMED:
Thailand's "Pro-Democracy" Movement Working for US," Thaksin Shinawatra
and his political regime have had long standing, well documented ties to
Wall Street and London.
The US backing of puppet-regimes like
Thaksin, installing them into power, and keeping them there is central
to projecting power throughout Asia and keeping China subordinate, or as
Kagan put it in his 1997 report, these proxy regimes will have China
"play Gulliver to Southeast Asia's Lilliputians, with the United States
supplying the rope and stakes.""
In Myanmar (Burma) "democracy icon" Aung San Suu Kyi, whose entire
movement is a creation of Wall Street and London, received Hillary
Clinton as well as Thailand's proxy-PM Yingluck Shinawatra in a
globalist show of support designating her as the defacto leader and
point of contact within the Southeast Asian country.
Clinton's visit coincided with a successful
campaign led by US NGOs to oust Chinese interests in the nation that
resulted in
the halting of a dam that was to provide electricity,
revenue, flood control and irrigation for the people of Myanmar.
The Myitsone Dam, on its way to being the 15th largest in the
world until construction
was halted in September by a campaign led by
Wall Street-puppet Aung San Suu Kyi,
a stable of US-funded NGOs, and
a
terrorist campaign executed
by armed groups operating in Kachin State,
Myanmar.
Meanwhile in Russia, Wall Street and London
attacked more directly, attempting to interfere with Russian elections
in December and resulting in several street protests
led by overtly
linked NED, Soros, and Rothschild operatives.
NED-funded NGO "Golos" played a key role in
portraying the elections as "rigged" and constituted America's
extraterritorial meddling in Russia's sovereign affairs.
NATO's creeping
encirclement of Russia
has now been combined
with another round of "color revolution" destabilizations
in Belarus and now in
Russia itself.
A concerted effort by the corporate-media to
misrepresent the unrest in Russia was pointed out in, "Russian Protests:
Western Media Lies," illustrating just how coordinated the overarching
global destabilization being carried out actually is.
In "Wall Street
Vs. Russia," it was concluded:
"It is quite clear that the National Endowment for Democracy, Freedom
House, the Foreign Policy Initiative, and even the US State Department
whose new foreign affairs advisory board is full of think-tanks
representing overt corporate-financier interests, are not interested in
"democracy," "human rights," or "freedom" in Russia, but rather removing
the Kremlin out of the way, and reestablishing the parasitic feeding on
the Russian people and its economy they enjoyed after the fall of the
Soviet Union."
In late December it would be confirmed that the same Al Qaeda militants
that ravaged Libya with NATO's aid, were on their way to Syria to help
overthrow the Assad government.
LIFG leader Abdel Hakim Belhaj was
confirmed to be on the Syrian border preparing troops of the so-called
"Free Syrian Army."
This wasn't the only recent example of the West operating in tandem with
listed terrorist groups.
It was also reported in, "EXPOSED: US Troops
Guarded Terrorist Camp in Iraq," that the US has been guarding a
terrorist Mujahedin-e Khalq training camp inside Iraq with US troops and
is planning to relocated them, possibly in a freshly abandoned US
military base in Iraq while D.C. lobbyists work feverishly to have them
de-listed, armed, and sent to conduct terrorist operations in Iran.
Shocking comments are made in the Brookings
Institution's report, "Which Path to Persia?" where US policy experts
conspire to use the terrorist organization against the government of
Iran.
In essence, corporate-funded policy makers have transformed the US
into a state-sponsor of terror.
