Sandia National Laboratories-West (SNL-W)
Sandia/Calif. Web Site
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who we are, what we do
Sandia is a national security laboratory operated for the U.S. Department
of Energy by the Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Co. We design all
non-nuclear components for the nation¹s nuclear weapons, perform a wide
variety of energy research and development projects, and work on assignments
that respond to national security threats ‹ both military and economic. We
encourage and seek partnerships with appropriate U.S. industry and government
groups to collaborate on emerging technologies that support our mission.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandia Vision
Helping our nation secure a peaceful and free world through technology.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to what the beginning of the Shadow government states about
Sandia National Laboratories-West which contradicts what Sandia's Web site
states, there is that National Security issue again. National Security has
achieved wars, AIDS, famine, illegal drugs, and other illnesses which
the government doesn't want to solve. That doesn't sound like security for
a nation to me and I imagine it doesn't to you either.
Since I place far more credence in the work of Dr. Boylan than I do in the
statement of Sandia's Web site formulators, we need to close down Sandia
National Laboratories. I will defer to all of you, however. You may know
more about this company than I do
