History is being written in the East.
As the
U.S. stays distracted with stone age warriors in Central Asia and the Middle
East, the last platform of the American economic foundation, the U.S.
Dollar's currency reserve status, is being underminded by their trade
partners in Asia.
Both Australia and Japan are set to start
direct-trading in Chinese currency and they are not the only ones. There are
almost 20 countries whom have currency swaps in place with China all in
order to side-step the U.S. Dollar in global trade.
At the China Money Report, we have written
extensively on the "Rise of the Renminbi".
What is new and largely unreported and what we
will cover in this article is the "Rise of the Petroyuan," as China is now
converting its oil imports into Chinese Yuan as opposed to U.S. Dollars.
This will be a new challenge and possibly the fatal blow to the U.S. Dollar
as the dominant global reserve currency.
With their industrial base all but gone, the housing market bubble popped,
and
the Federal Reserve funding the majority of the government debt
with printed currency, the American economy can ill-afford a new challenge
to its currency's reserve status. It is this very reserve status which has
led to America being able to consume more than it produces for decades upon
decades as foreign countries were willing to trade consumer products for
paper
IOU's.
The Dollar's reserve status came about naturally
after WW2 as the U.S. was the world's largest trading nation, exporter, and
creditor. Today, China occupies all of these slots.
China will soon occupy a new slot: That of the world's largest oil importer.
OPEC has confirmed on April 4th of this year
that they expect China to surpass the United States as the world's largest
oil importer in 2014. This shift in global oil flows is being driven by the
twin pillars of a booming Chinese economy and Americas newfound booming
domestic oil and gas supply.
This shift in the oil trade carries with it
massive geopolitical implications that will reshape the world as we know it.
Chinas Increasing Oil
Imports
The demand side of oil from China has already reshaped geopolitics and
global supply chains.
Between 2002 and 2010, China's annual imports of crude
increased from 70m tonnes to more than 270 million tonnes. Saudi Arabias
largest customer for oil is no longer the U.S. but the Peoples Republic of
China. In the year 2012, Chinas net oil imports were still 1 million
barrels per day lower than in the United States, but in some months, China
was very close and even surpassed the U.S. in net oil imports.
In December
2012 for instance, China imported 6 million barrels a day compared to only
5.98 million barrels in the U.S. From 2010-2015 alone, oil imports in China
are expected to grow over 40%. China's oil demand growth is expected to
represent 64% of all new demand for oil in 2012-2013.
The upside potential of oil imports into China are still not understood by
most analysts and the potential on how large they could become is
incredible.
Car sales in China are already almost twice the levels in the
U.S. and sales are up 20% for the first two months of 2013. Keep in mind
that 90% of car sales are paid cash-up-front and most large cities have
prohibitive taxes and quotas against new car sales.
Despite these
regulations, sales are still up 20% so far in 2013. All of these new cars
and trucks will of course require more oil that China will need to import.
General Motors already sells more vehicles in China than they do the United
States and their sales are growing double-digits.
China's increasing dependence on imported oil has threatened the country's
energy security and it is of major concern to the government. Chinas oil
dependence is expected to reach 59.4 percent in 2013.
Be assured, China is
building a blue-water navy and developing the global relationships, which
will be required to protect this supply of crude they require today and the
ever increasing amount they will need in the future.
Indeed, the country of
China may be forced into becoming the reluctant military superpower to
guarantee that they have access to global oil markets.
Americans Turning Off
Oil Imports
In comparison to China, the US reliance on foreign energy imports has
declined considerably, and many are predicting that the US could be energy
self-sufficient by 2030 thanks to its surging domestic production of shale
gas and oil.
The US is now expected to be a gas exporter by 2020 instead of
the previously projected 2022. Domestic oil supplies as well as Canadian
supplies will make North America energy independent.
This is good news for
the U.S. and this new found wealth could be used for a new platform for a
revitalized American economy if they can substantially restructure the tax and
legal system which has driven production out of the country.
Trading Oil for Yuan
Recent reports from Reuters, have confirmed that China is now trading their
own domestic currency, the Yuan, for oil.
Both Russia, and Iran are now
using Yuan for oil sales to China. Venezuela is sure to follow.
With Russia
and Iran accepting Yuan for oil that means there are now almost 1 million
barrels per day being exchanged for Yuan instead of USD.
Angola can be
expected to move oil sales into Chinese Yuan if they haven't already. Over
half of their oil sales are now to China.
For Venezuela, the political
relationship with the U.S. is well known as fear of the U.S. military might
be the only thing stopping them from shifting oil sales into Yuan now.
Sudan
is another country, highly dependent on China politically and will most
likely convert their oil sales into Chinese Yuan.
If Russia, Iran, Angola, Sudan, and Venezuela all convert just their oil
sales to China into the Chinese Yuan the world will see over 5 million
barrels per day traded not in U.S. dollars but in Chinese Yuan.
Good night
Petro Dollar... Hello Petro Yuan.
Geopolitical Shift and Rise
of the Petro Yuan
Does China, as the worlds largest importer of oil then take charge of
global sea lanes to ensure the trade in oil?
This has been a priority of the
U.S. military for the last 50 years. The Pentagon is spending $1.58 trillion
annually on hardware for trucks, planes, ships, and guns. In 2013, their
cost increase alone was $74 billion. The cost increases this year alone, of
$74 billion, is more than Russias entire military budget.
Can America
justify a defense budget of this size to protect sea lines for Saudi crude
going to China?
What about the so called King Dollar?
For decades you could trade oil for
dollars. This relationship has gone a long way towards making the U.S.
dollar the worlds reserve currency. What happens when the U.S. no longer
needs to buy imported oil.
As time goes on, the oils futures markets will no
doubt shift more to Dubai and Dalian, than West Texas and Brent Crude. In
decades past, America's thirst for energy imports resulted in all oil
contracts being denominated in U.S. Dollars, the so-called Petro Dollar.
The
Petro Dollar is now headed for extinction to make way for the Petro Yuan.
We are all witnessing the birth pangs of a new global reserve currency and
the "Rise of the Petro Yuan".
