Even putting current tensions between the
country and Japan aside for the moment, China has seen a great deal of civil
unrest in recent months.
With citizens losing faith in their government,
and the gap between the poor and the wealthy seemingly growing ever larger,
it is little wonder that protests and riots are occurring more and more
frequently.
At the
end of June, pictures emerged of clashes between residents and armed police
in the Canton region.
It later become clear that the riot occurred
following little more than a scuffle between two boys from neighboring towns
that got out of hand. Angry that men from the first boys town had entered
into the argument, adults from the second boys town also became involved,
and the spat quickly grew out of hand with thousands of locals eventually
becoming involved in the fray.
During last weeks incredibly heated
anti-Japanese demonstrations in China, images came forth of Chinese
attacking and looting stores that
bore no relation to Japan whatsoever.
Of course, theres a lot that can be said about
the effects of mob mentality, and its easy for people, especially those who
feel that they have been dealt an injustice by those in power and the
wealthy, to become swept up in the mayhem.
As some of you may recall, in perhaps one of the
countrys lowest moments, England saw
three days of riots and mob violence in
several major cities during the summer of 2011.
What initially began as a protest in response to
the shooting by police of a young man in London soon became violent, and
within a matter of hours the streets were lost to thugs and petty criminals
who mugged, robbed and smashed whatever and whomever they met.
When asked what their motivation was for such
acts of senseless violence, many, particularly from poorer areas of the
country, attempted to justify their behavior by arguing that they received
little-to-no support from the authorities, and that the areas in which they
lived were run-down and often entirely forgotten by the government.
Few would agree that reasons such as these
justify their behavior, but civil unrest, it would seem, is not an issue
that China alone is facing.
China,
however, is notoriously protective of its information,
making it difficult
for those of us outside the country to grasp the state or scale of the
situation behind the great firewall beyond drip-fed images of protests and
clashes.
So on September 19, when a Chinese internet user
posted a message revealing the severity of the situation and posting some
shocking figures relating to the Chinese governments recent expenditure, it
understandably made headlines.
At this
moment in time, the Chinese government is thought to be spending
approximately eighty billion US dollars per year on issues of civil
unrest and calming outbursts of this kind.
The figure, although obviously huge, is
difficult to visualize until the unnamed internet user presents us with an
utterly mind-boggling comparison:
If this
level of spending continues, in five years China will have spent as much
on dealing with its own civil unrest and local security as the US on its
recent war budget.
Shocking isnt the word
