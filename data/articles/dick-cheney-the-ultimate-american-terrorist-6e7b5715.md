Simply stated, there is no doubt
that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.
- Dick Cheney
It is axiomatic by now: when someone leaves government service, especially
from a high-profile position, they write a book.
They all do it, sometimes more than once.
Richard Nixon is the main example of one who produced a multi-volume
apologia; by the time he went into the ground, he'd penned enough books to
fill a wide shelf.
Henry Kissinger was similarly prolific, which leads one
to wonder about the relationship between criminal activities and the printed
page.
Nixon was chased from office after a series of
crimes that, at the time, had no precedent, and Kissinger is still so
infamous that he cannot travel abroad for fear of arrest.
Both wrote enough books to take up half the
political science section of any local bookstore, perhaps in the vain
attempt to explain away the lasting damage their actions did to the
republic.
Speaking of damaging the republic, Dick Cheney
has a book out.
I'm sure
you've heard about it by now; he laid the groundwork for its release by
claiming the contents would cause heads to explode in Washington, causing a
lot of people who should know better by now to say,
"Ooooh, this should be good."
It isn't, at all, but I must confess that my
head did come very close to launching itself off my shoulders... not because
of what's in the book, but because I have to deal with the rancid reality of
a free and un-convicted Dick Cheney appearing in the public eye once again.
If there were any justice to be found in this deranged country, Dick Cheney
would have penned his pestiferous, self-serving little memoir by the light
of a bare bulb inside the cell of a federal prison.
If there were any justice to be found, Mr.
Cheney would be forced to contend with the "Son of Sam Law," which,
according to
World Law Direct,
"refers to a type of law designed to keep
criminals from profiting from their crimes, often by selling their
stories to publishers. Such laws often authorize the state to seize
money earned from such a deal and use it to compensate the criminal's
victims."
The Son of Sam, a.k.a.
David Berkowitz,
killed six people and wounded several others during his notorious
summer-long shooting spree in New York.
Berkowitz is an absolute piker compared to Dick
Cheney, whose actions directly caused deaths and injuries that number in the
hundreds of thousands. The deaths he is responsible for are ongoing to this
day, in fact.
If there were any justice to be found, whatever
profits he earns from his book would be spread out between the families of
dead and wounded soldiers whom he lied into war in Iraq, between the
families of dead and wounded Iraqi civilians, and between Americans like
Valerie Plame, who along with numerous other intelligence figures, had their
lives bulldozed by Cheney's eight-year rampage through our system of
government.
It would hardly amount to a pittance paid to each injured party - there are
so many to account for! - but it would be a kind of justice all the same,
for nary a dime of profit would line Dick Cheney's already-stuffed pockets.
Alas, the generations to come will be forced to reckon with one of the great
and lasting failures of the Obama administration: the simple, unbelievable
fact of Dick Cheney's continued freedom. He and his ilk committed enough
brazen crimes to keep a brace of federal prosecutors busy for the next
twenty-five years, and yet Mr. Cheney remains unmolested by the system of
law he so vigorously disdained.
According to Wikileaks, not only has the Obama
administration failed to seek a reckoning with Cheney, they worked
vigorously behind the scenes to ensure that no such reckoning will ever come
to pass.
And so we have Dick, and his book, and yet another hard lesson on the
absence of justice. He'll make a few bucks off the thing, which he can bank
next to the obscene millions he gained through his nefarious Halliburton war
profiteering. He was still getting paid by Halliburton while in office.
Remember that? They called it a "deferred
retirement benefit," an annual check with six zeroes to the left of the
decimal, and all the while Cheney was steering your tax dollars into
Halliburton's coffers with a blizzard of bald-faced lies about weapons of
mass destruction in Iraq.
There is so much to remember about Dick Cheney's time in office.
-
There was the Office of Special Plans,
which he created to formulate the most effective lies possible about
Iraq, WMD, and connections to
September 11
-
There was the torture in Abu Ghraib and
elsewhere, which he referred to as "the dark side" and which he
championed with great vigor
-
There was his dismissal of
lawfully-issued congressional subpoenas, and his dedication to the
idea of a "Unitary Executive" which is beholden to nothing and no
one
-
There was his broad plan to spy on
millions of Americans without a warrant, which he wanted to continue
even after the whole thing was declared to be illegal
-
There was (and remains) the program of
indefinite detention without due process of law, which was his baby
-
There was the coddling of known criminal
and double-agent
Ahmed Chalabi, who was his pal
There was all this, and so much more besides,
but one incident stands out in my mind above all else.
It was only an accent in the symphony of
wrongdoing Cheney directed from his office, and was barely noticed at the
time, but I will never forget it.
It was a simple thing, really:
the National Archives, by dint of two
different federal laws, annually collects the official papers of the
Executive Branch for the edification of future historians, researchers
and government officials. It is a by-rote requirement, one small cog in
the wheelworks of government, but not this time.
Dick Cheney said no.
No, you cannot have any papers from the office
of the Vice President, and for one reason: the office of the Vice President,
because I say so, is not part of the Executive Branch.
It deserves to be written twice:
Dick Cheney actually claimed, with his bare
face hanging out to all the world, that the office of the Vice President
is not part of the Executive Branch.
The unmitigated gall required to utter such a
claim, especially after so much talk about the "Unitary Executive," is
unparalleled in modern American history.
There, right there, is everything you need to know about the man.
Dick
Cheney is the ultimate American terrorist, one who not only lacks respect
for American law and government, but who spent his eight years in office
actively working to destroy and dismember the functions of that government.
He tore the place up, deliberately and with
intent, because he hated the law and the government it supported, and we
will be a long time recovering from his deeds. He is directly and personally
responsible for thousands of deaths and injuries.
If this is not terrorism in the raw, then the
word has no meaning.
Dick Cheney has blood on his hands, but will remain free for the foreseeable
future because the administration that replaced his lacks the honor,
integrity and intestinal fortitude to address what he has done. Until such a
reckoning is at hand, all I can do is remind Mr. Cheney, and anyone who will
listen, of another fact of law that, God willing, will be brought to bear
against him someday.
There is no statute of limitations on murder, and murder is exactly what he
did.
