# You Want to Be Uncle Sam's Bitch? - Pay the Price!

First, this is a typically Russian response.
There is a
basic rule which every Russian kid learns in school, in
street fights, in the military or elsewhere: never
promise and never threaten - just act. Unlike western
politicians who spent months threatening sanctions, the
all the Russians did was to say, rather vaguely, that
they reserve the right to reply.
And
then, BANG!, this wide and far-reaching embargo which,
unlike the western sanctions, will have a major impact
on the West, but even much more so on Russia (more about
that in an instant).
This "no
words & only action" tactic is designed to maximize
deterrence of hostile acts: since the Russians do not
clearly spell out what they could do in retaliation, God
only knows what they could do next! :-) On top of that,
to maximize insecurity, the Russians only said that
these were the measures agreed upon, but not when they
would be introduced, partially or fully, and against
whom.
They
also strongly implied that other measure were under
consideration in the pipeline.

Second, the sanctions are wonderfully targeted.
The
Europeans have acted like spineless and brainless
prostitutes in this entire business, they were opposed
to sanctions from day 1, but they did not have the
courage to tell that to Uncle Sam, so each time they
ended up caving in.
Russia's
message to the EU is simple:
you
want to be Uncle Sam's bitch? Pay the price!
This
embargo will especially hurt southern Europe (Spain,
France, Italy, Greece) whose agricultural production
will greatly suffer from it.
These
countries also happen to be the weakest in the EU. By
hitting them, Russia is maximizing the inevitable
friction inside the EU over sanctions against Russia.

Third, not only will EU carriers suffer from much higher
costs and flight times on the very important Europe to
Asia route, but the Asian carriers will not, giving the
latter a double competitive advantage.
How is that for a
way to reward one side while hurting the other?
The EU
got
one Russian airline in trouble over its flights to
Crimea (Dobrolet) and for that the entire EU
airlines community could end being at a huge
disadvantage vis-Ã -vis its Asian counterparts.

Fourth, Russia used these sanctions to do something
vital for the Russian economy.
Let
me explain: after the collapse of the USSR the
Russian agriculture was in disarray, and Yeltsin only made things worse.
Russian
farmers simply could not compete against advanced
western agro-industrial concerns which benefited from
huge economies of scale, from expensive and high-tech
chemical and biological research, which had a full chain
of production (often through large holdings), and a top
quality marketing capability.
The
Russian agricultural sector badly, desperately, needed
barriers and tariffs to be protected form the western
capitalist giants and, instead, Russia voluntarily
abided by the terms of the WTO and then eventually
became member.
Now
Russia is using this total embargo to provide a
crucially needed time for the Russian agriculture to
invest and take up a much bigger share on the Russian
market. Also, keep in mind that Russian products are
GMO-free,
and that they have much less preservatives, antibiotics,
colors, taste enhancers, or pesticides.
And
since they are local, they don't need to be brought in
by using the kind of refrigeration/preservation
techniques which typically make products taste like
cardboard. In other words, Russian agricultural products
taste much better, but that is not enough to complete.
This
embargo now gives them a powerful boost to invest,
develop and conquer market shares.

Fifth, there are 100 countries which did not vote with
the US on Crimea.
The Russians have already announced
that these are the countries with which Russia will
trade to get whatever products it cannot produce
indigenously. A nice reward for standing up to Uncle
Sam.

Sixth, small but sweet:
did
you notice that EU sanctions were introduced for 3
months only, "to be reviewed" later?
By
introducing a 12 months embargo Russia also sends a
clear message:
who
do you think will benefit from this mess?
7 -
Seventh,
it is plain wrong to calculate that EU country X was
exporting for Y million dollars to Russia and to then
conclude that the Russian embargo will cost Y million
dollars to EU country X.
Why is
it wrong?
Because
the non-sale of these product with create a surplus
which will then adversely affect the demand or, if the
production is decreased, this will affect production
costs (economies of scale).
Conversely, for a hypothetical non-EU country Z a
contract with Russia might mean enough cash to invest,
modernize and become more competitive, not only in
Russia, but on the world market, including the EU.
8 -
Eighth, the Baltic countries have played a particularly
nasty role in the entire Ukrainian business and now some
of their most profitable industries (such as fisheries),
which were 90% dependent on Russia, will have to shut
down.
These countries are already a mess, but now they
will hurt even more.
Again,
the message to them is simple:
you
want to be Uncle Sam's bitch? Pay the price!

Ninth,
and this is really important, what is happening is a
gradual decoupling of Russia from the western economies.
The West
severed some of the financial, military and aerospace
ties, Russia severed the monetary, agricultural and
industrial ones. Keep in mind that the US/EU market is a
sinking one, affected by deep systemic problems and huge
social issues.
In a
way, the perfect comparison is the Titanic whose
orchestra continued to play music while the sink was
sinking. Well, Russia is like a passenger who is told
that the Titanic's authorities have decided to disembark
him at the next port.
Well, gee, too bad, right?

10 - Last,
but most definitely not least, this trade-war, combined
with the West's hysterical russophobia, is doing for
Putin a better PR campaign than anything the Kremlin
could have dreamed of.
All his
PR people need to tell the Russian population is the
truth:
"we
did everything right, we played it exactly by the
book, we did everything we could to deescalate this
crisis and all we asked for was to please not allow
the genocide of our people in Novorussia - and what
was the West's response to that?
An
insane hate campaign, sanctions against us and
unconditional support for the genocidal Nazis in
Kiev".
Furthermore, as somebody who carefully follows the
Russian media, I can tell you that what is taking place
today feels a lot like, paraphrasing
Von Clausewitz, the "a
continuation of 'politik' (WWII), but by other means", in other
words a struggle to the end between two regimes, two
civilizations, which cannot coexist on the same planet
and who are locked in struggle to death.
In these
circumstances, expect the Russian people to support
Putin even more.
