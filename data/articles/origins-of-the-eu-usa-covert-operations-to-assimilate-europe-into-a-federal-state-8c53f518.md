For anyone who still has doubts, the European Union was not really motivated by the twin desires of ending warfare on the continent of Europe and promoting economic growth by making it easier for European countries to trade with each other.
This was the story you were spoon-fed. It was actually the creation of America.
Read on...
Post second world war, America saw the opportunity to transform a war torn continent. It wanted Europe to be complimentary to American policy, viewing American federalism an an ideal political model.
It wanted to assimilate Europe and implemented various covert operations to undermine staunch resistance to federalist ideas, especially by the British Labour government. The opportunity was a puppet run super-state filled with attendant yes men for trade and the manipulation of strategic global markets and, just as importantly a defensive buffer zone against it's new foe - the Reds from Russia and China.
Diplomatic historians have unearthed evidence of U.S. backed covert operations designed to undermine communist influences in Europe.
U.S. officials worked on a plan in 1950 to lead to a United States of Europe. It is here we see the emergence of the Bilderberg Group and The Action Committee for a United States of Europe.
Winston Churchill was one of the five presidents of the Council of Europe, a disparate organization urging rapid European unification.
Interestingly, these particular documents were not found in the archives in America or Britain, but in Brussels, the de facto capital of the European Union.
In addition, Washington feared emerging markets and anything remotely resembling an eastern alliance such as Russia and China, which has since morphed into the BRICS economic group of nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and the creation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
At the end of last year the IMF even added the Yuan to its basket of reserve currencies, an international stamp of approval of the strides China has made integrating into a global economic system dominated for decades by the U.S., Europe and Japan.
BRICS was originally coined in 2003 by Goldman Sachs, which speculated that by 2050 these economies will be the most dominant in the world.
In the last thirty years America has seen evidence of the advancement of emerging nations by the huge decline in production and export of it's own goods and services. International trade has diminished 30% in just three decades and halved since the second world war.
America knew its economic dominance would be under threat back in the late 1940's and wanted a United States of Europe to provide a huge cushion to such eventualities.
In 2000, declassified American government administration documents show that the U.S. intelligence service started to run a large scale campaign in the Fifties and Sixties to build momentum for a united Europe.
It also funded and fully directed the European federalist movement, something which many EU members states resisted with many eventually capitulating - "you're either with us or against us".
The documents show that the American Committee for a United Europe (ACUE) financed the operations of the European Movement, the most important federalist organization in the post-war years. In 1958, it provided more than half of the movement's funds.
These operations were managed by the CIA but as documents show it took its orders from the U.S. State Department.
Operations included funding political groups allied to American values and/or policy, undermining trade unions and influencing cultural and intellectual trends in Europe.
It went further with operations deliberately provoking dissonance in non compliant states and created 'stay-behind' or GLADIO networks designed to train special forces, spy networks and disruption teams to stem any potential for Soviet incursion or even business activity into western Europe.
The leaders of the European Movement - Jozef Retinger, Robert Schuman and the former Belgian prime minister Paul-Henri Spaak - were all treated as hired hands by their American sponsors.
ACUE's covert funding came from the Ford and Rockefeller foundations as well as business groups with close ties to the U.S. government and the CIA.
Its been a step by step process, but very much a planned one. It started with the Brussels Treaty 1948, from there to the Paris Treaty 1952. Then the process continued in the guise of the Modified Brussels Treaty of 1955 and then on to the Treaty of Rome 1958.
This all then led to a Merger of Treaties in 1967 that was called the Common Market but ended up as the European Economic Community (EEC).
Many British citizens and MP's were uncertain and deeply suspicious of the intentions of this new club. The Conservatives pushed entry through in 1973 without reference to the electorate.
In opposition, Labour ran a manifesto on the run-up to the 1975 election based upon renegotiating the terms and conditions of entry, won, and a referendum took place in June 1975. The Labour party itself voted overwhelmingly to leave the EEC prior to the referendum but the public voted 65% in favor.
The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 laid the real foundation stones of the European Union which, was enhanced further by the Amsterdam Treaty 1997.
The Nice Treaty of 2003 was next and then finally The Treaty of Lisbon (initially known as the Reform Treaty), an agreement which amended the two treaties to form the constitutional basis of the European Union (EU).
The Treaty of Lisbon was signed by the EU member states on 13 December 2007, and entered into force on 1 December 2009, which remains in force today.
At this point it is fundamental to note that the European Union has no constitution. Some say it doesn't need one as all the treaties combined constitute one. Previous attempts have failed and the EU is still not a federal state as a result.
Originally, the EU, characterized by solidarity and mutual trust between European citizens have seen these foundation stones dramatically eroded. Ironically, it's America that is causing so much damage to a union it wants merely for its geopolitical and monetary purposes.
Involvement in unpopular wars, psychotic American banking, parasitic hedge funds preying on susceptible nations such as Greece, Spain and Portugal, disruption to international relations, particularly with Russia and some of its own nations, spying, mass surveillance, currency devaluations and much more leads many Europeans to despising the EU itself and U.S. involvement.
The EU and U.S. are the biggest economic and military powers in the world, despite the lack of a common EU defense policy. They dominate global trade, they play the leading roles in international political relations, and what one says matters a great deal to much of the rest of the world.
They have similar populations, almost identical religious composition and both have $18 trillion (GDP) economies - but America still wants domination.
A memo from the U.S. State Department dated June 11, 1965, advised the vice-president of the European Economic Community, Robert Marjolin, to pursue monetary union by stealth.
It recommended suppressing debate until the point at which,
"adoption of such proposals would become virtually inescapable".
The vision of American economic dominance is now within sight with the secretive and soon to be enforced trade deal known as TTIP.
This agreement represents a massive attack on the sovereignty of democratically elected governments and clearly shows American intentions right from the beginning in 1950. The U.S. wants to harmonize standards between the EU and the U.S., seen by opponents as hitting hard-won protections on food and chemical safety (e.g. in cosmetics, insecticides and pesticides), the environment and workers' rights.
U.S. agribusiness is pressing hard for Europe to import currently illegal GM products (which the EU authorized imports of in April 2015), and meat that does not conform to EU standards, such as cattle raised with growth hormones (this ban continues but only with an agreement to buy an additional 48,000 tonnes annually of American beef without growth hormones).
Fracking and the privatization of the NHS are all in sight of American corporations, both of which are aggressively promoted by a Conservative neocon right-wing government whose profit driven ideology will turn Britain into a western outpost vassal state of the USA if it is allowed to continue.
The reason the TTIP negotiations are so secretive is that the Americans recommended, as stated previously,
"suppressing debate until which point adoption was inescapable".
The reason for the American initiated and secretive Bilderberg Group, defined as an ultra-select bunch of elite lobbyists made up of,
politicians U.S. corporate chiefs EU officials captains of industry heads of intelligence agencies European royals,
politicians
U.S. corporate chiefs
EU officials
captains of industry
heads of intelligence agencies
European royals,
...is that all major business/finance lobbyists for the TTIP will be under the same roof. It is not hard for the informed to understand what the real agenda is.
What you are witnessing is a corporate coups d'Ã©tat of Europe by America... as planned...
Return to American "Empire"
Return to Globalization and The European Union
