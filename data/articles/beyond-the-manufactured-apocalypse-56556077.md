They dont own the earth.
-
They dont own you and
me.
-
They dont own all their stupid secret symbols.
-
They dont own the
present, they dont own the future.
-
They dont even own themselves.
Theyre usurpers, in every sense of the word. And absolutely nothing to
fear.
That these invading power freaks striving to control the world should try to
lay claim to some secret knowledge and power source thats superior to
everything else is a fraud. That they so feverishly endeavor to bring on
world changing events that result in national clampdowns and
population
reduction is their personal nightmare in the making.
And we need to see it for what it is. A spiritual charade.
While we have to deal with their very real machinations theyve unleashed in
their attempt to destroy the earth and most of its inhabitants for whatever
sick reason theyve conjured, they have no truly superior super powers to
fear. Just an ugly willingness to tap in to sorcery tools that make them
lords over their own ugly fabrications.
The nightmare is theirs, not ours. We just have to deal with the fallout
from their insanity. But we can do so consciously and with great peace of
mind and heart in spite of all of their efforts to induce fear.
The fact is, there is no secret but that which is willfully withheld or
deliberately ignored. And to the conscious, nothing is hidden that cannot be
revealed.
The fact that they have to hide it rather than conscientiously share
whatever they claim to know is evidence in itself as to their dark nature
and self-serving intentions. Youd think humanity would see the continued
suppression of empowering and healing knowledge and information and start to
catch on, but alas, the conditioning has been very effective.
But not for much longer.
Their matrix of power is unraveling as we speak. Dont let the sabre
rattling and scare tactics fool you.
Their days are almost over.
Rothschild arrogance on full
display
Their Puny Pride Is on
the Run
So much of the big lie that were witnessing on
the world stage is simply projected pride - the big, fat, stinking
manufactured pride of pathological egomaniacs reinforcing a fabricated world
of their ugly, demented imaginations.
Whether world conquest piggy-backing on natural
and manufactured catastrophes, attempting to morph humanity into some kind
of
transhuman gnome, or
terraform our environment to meet their
specifications for world control, its all defensive.
Theyre scared.
It is they who are running and hiding from something so incredibly powerful
they have to erect giant sand castles to hide behind while they attempt to
exterminate all those who carry this amazing potential to realize Truth.
Us. An awakened and empowered us is what theyre absolutely frightened of.
And like the cowardly bullies in the playground, they know their time is
almost up.
Our warfare is a spiritual one. Whether we encase this understanding in one
of the more classic frameworks or see it completely metaphysically, the play
were witnessing is nothing to fear. The feverish power struggles and social
engineering taking place on such a massive scale are all based in fear.
Fear of you, and fear of me. Because we represent the potential connection
to Truth. And their inevitable downfall.
Evil Pentagram fruits? Or natures true meaning of love and beauty.
Example: Co-opting Natures
Sacred Geometry
A perfect example of this shadowy charade is
the Brotherhoods usurpation
of symbols.
While we know this supplanting of authority is true about their false
hierarchy and self-imposed ownership of lands, natural and even human
resources, theyve cleverly tried to co-opt the inherent powers of the
so-called mystery schools, the language of which is numbers and symbols.
What people forget is almost all of these symbols occur naturally with
wonderful positive, regenerative properties. What these lying entities have
done is simply attach negative and destructive and abusive connotations to
anything they can.
A perfect example of how once youre wrapped up in their
world of interpretation with an abusive, violent world around you to back it
up, you begin to think the lie is true.
Therein lies their only power. Your belief and entertaining of their
notions, empowered to appear real only by your participation. Turn it off.
Turn off
their sources-mainstream media, staged events, manipulated music,
shallow publicity, even phony personal responses and relationships.
Its time to get real.
Remember, their whole plan is designed to replace reality with
a false
matrix of power thats fed by fear. Dont dwell on it, and see it for what
it is. And reverse the flow.
Each one of us changes the direction of Spaceship Earth.
Conclusion - Uncork the
X-Factor
By our very clarity of understanding, our conscious awareness of the Truth
and our not submitting to their web of deceit, we throw off the illusory
shackles of the would-be controllers.
Just one persons total lack of fear, not giving
any obeisance to their societal, political, economic or physical oppression
network, is a flame in their flimsy cobweb.
Be it.
Theyre lying usurpers... but it only works with our agreement. Our
conscious awareness, as vague as that may seem to some, is the ultimate
weapon. And it starts with waking the hell up and then keep waking up
rattling as many other cages as we can in the process. Its not always a
smooth process, but it requires honesty and guts.
And cutting the bullshit.
As our collective consciousness grows more awake and aware it gains power
and tremendous momentum. The x-factor is
synchronicity. When each of us
responds to Universal consciousness things change dramatically.
Lifes signs become increasingly apparent and
start challenging and leading our lives more and more, activating them in
ways we never knew could have such a powerful influence.
With each and every wake up the war is won. It was won in the beginning. We
just need to stop believing the illusions around us and acting on our true
conscience.
At that point it becomes now.
