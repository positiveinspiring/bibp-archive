A copy of a UBS Platinum certificate
in the name of "Mr. Soekarno" dated 23rd
March 1961. The certificate exhibits some
glaring spelling and typographical errors - for
example, the name of the bullion bank and metal
refiners, Johnson Mathey, is rendered as "Jhonson
and Mathew." This once again, poses
the question if the certificate is legitimate or the
result of a fraudster? Would an expert
counterfeiter who has probably spent weeks working on
the artwork suddenly become so slack as to allow such
obvious errors to denigrate what is otherwise
meticulous work? Or could it be a case of
in-built and purposeful deniability in cases where the
client or depositor possess a sensitive background?
