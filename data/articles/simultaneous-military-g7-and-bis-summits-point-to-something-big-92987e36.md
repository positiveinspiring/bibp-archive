Major world changes are clearly close on the horizon.
This past weekend saw a G7 Finance Ministers
summit near the North pole, a
BIS central bank governors summit in
Australia and a gathering of the worlds military leaders (including NATO,
Russia and China) in Germany. All of this is a sign of preparation for some
major public announcements almost certainly related to the new financial
system.
The
Federal Reserve Board has been actively buying up all its old
bonds, notes and Treaty of Versaille boxes at 1% of their face value,
according to a
Black Dragon Society member with
esoteric banking connections. The Bank of Japan has also been buying up all
of its bonds owned by non-Japanese. These are some other indications a big
announcement is imminent.
The most likely scenario, according to our sources, is that the 90% of US
dollars owned by non-Americans will be renamed Hong Kong dollars and backed
by the Renminbi.
There are conflicting plans for the US as we
write but our latest information is that a gold-backed Amero will replace
the Mexican peso as well as the US and Canadian dollars to form a North
American region currency. In preparation for such an event the Pentagon, the
Canadian mounted police and Mexican Federales are said to be prepared to
deal with civil unrest in the US, according to our sources.
The Amero will have a lot less purchasing
power (30 to 50% less) internationally than the US dollar has now so many
Americans will be understandably angry when the change is announced.
The un-escapable fact though, is that Americans
have been living beyond their means for the past 30 years.
Nonetheless, it is still not clear if the
Washington D.C.
criminal establishment will be ousted and replaced by an interim
government until the US can return to constitutional law and hold new
elections. There is still infighting going on as we write and a final
showdown has yet to be seen.
It remains to be seen if the US falls into civil war but Pentagon sources
believe this can be avoided if the military takes legal steps to remove the
criminal corporate government in Washington D.C.
Meanwhile, the military summit in Munich revealed some major geo-political
changes that may be related to this. Basically, there was talk of Russia
joining NATO with, among others, Polish delegates making this suggestion.
This coincides with arm sales by the US and the EU to Taiwan as well as
military exercises in Thailand involving Thai, Japanese, Indonesian and
Singaporean troops.
All of these moves are clearly aimed at
telling China not to overstep itself and assume it can form a China
centric world dictatorship.
Of course the Chinese delegate in Munich made it very clear that China had
no such ambition. Senior Chinese sources in fact did tell me earlier that
China did want to rule the world but of course now that they have been
confronted with all of these forces they have had to scale back their
ambitions.
The center of world financial and intellectual gravity will nonetheless
shift to China over the coming decades but it will do so in an organic
fashion that does not alienate or endanger anybody.
The only way for the West to prevent this from happening would be for them
to purge their financial and political systems of the criminal element
that took over the highest echelons of power.
There are many signs that such a purge has already begun and will continue
for a long time.
-
First of all the financial industry has
seen thousands of bankers arrested and hundreds murdered.
Eventually, the ring-leaders of
the 911 attacks will be arrested if
not executed. This only a matter of time now.
-
Secondly, the
pharmaceutical industry is going to
see a major purge as the criminal element that deliberately
manufactured diseases in order to sell cures continues to be
exposed. Cures are already available for most diseases so that
industry will have to retool itself towards the creation of life,
ability and pleasure enhancing substances.
-
The application of
free energy technology to replace
petroleum will also begin in earnest. In order to prevent social
disruption the oil, nuclear and other industries will undergo an
orderly transformation. Early use of free energy technology will be
restricted to such things as turning deserts green.
-
The political class is also going to see
a major purge and many governments are expected to fall over the
coming year. Regime change is likely in Canada, England, Germany and
the US.
It is not clear if all of these changes will be
made with big public announcements or if they will just be phased in over
time. Hopefully there will be a truth commission set up.
Meanwhile, right wing elements in Japan are busy plotting the creation of a
nationalist party to compete with the ruling Democratic Party of Japan
(DPJ). They are trying to get right-leaning members of the DPJ to defect to
a new party.
They have also forced the DPJ to distance itself a bit from China and take a
more balanced diplomatic approach.
Overall, there is a lot of confusion in government circles in most Western
countries as well as in Japan because the political class was mostly
unaware of the existence of a
secret government above them that ruled via
control of
the financial system.
There may not be any big public announcements this week. However, a date to
watch for is February 15th. This Chinese new year is a special
once in 60 years year of the tiger and it begins on February 14th.
That is a Sunday so the first day markets will
open after that will be the 15th.
Since many Chinese believe in numerology and
Chinese astrology and, even if they dont, it would be logical to announce
the new financial system at the beginning of the Chinese new-year.
