Warning: Since this video seems to have gone crazy, I figure I'll post this
notice.
I'm going to read a letter my 15 year old
daughter wrote. There ARE some curse words in it. None of them are
incredibly bad, but they are definitely things a little kid shouldn't
hear... not to mention things MY KID shouldn't say!
If you want to see the original FaceBook thread, it's located at:

My daughter thought it would be funny/rebellious/cool to post on her
FaceBook wall just how upset she was and how unfair her life here is; how we
work her too hard with chores, never pay her for chores, and just in general
make her life difficult.
She chose to share this with the entire world on FaceBook and block her
parent's from seeing it. Well, umm... she failed. As of the end of this
video, she won't have to worry anymore about posting inappropriate things on
FaceBook...
Maybe a few kids can take something away from this...
If you're so disrespectful to your parents and
yourself as to post this kind of thing on FaceBook, you're deserving of some
tough love. Today, my daughter is getting a dose of tough love.
