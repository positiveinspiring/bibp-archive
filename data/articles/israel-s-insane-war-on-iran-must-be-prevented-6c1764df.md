Israels attack on a humanitarian aid ship
headed for Gaza may prove to be the greatest strategic error the government
has ever made.
Like the
Soweto riots in South Africa in 1976, or
Bloody Sunday - the American civil rights
march on March 7, 1965, in Selma, Alabama, where police opened fire and
killed civilians - the Mavi Marmara affair crossed a red line.
It has triggered an international wave of
condemnation, expressing a shift in attitude toward Israel.
The hope is that this international outrage,
flanked by growing anti-government dissent inside the country, will provoke
an identity crisis among the elite and people of Israel, shake up the
political kaleidoscope and allow for a viable pro-peace force to emerge.
Unless this occurs, new Israeli aggression,
including against Iran, will remain high on their immediate agenda.
The details of the May 31 events are well known, documented by passengers on
the Mavi Marmara headed for Gaza. Among the most dramatic was the
eye-witness account of Ken OKeefe on BBCs Hard Talk show, who
effectively dismantled attempts by his interviewer to legitimize the Israeli
position (that the passengers were armed terrorists etc.), and established
that the Israeli military opened fire immediately after boarding the ship,
killing 9 in cold blood.(1)
German doctor Matthias Jochheim, a member
of the IPPNW on board, has delivered his own low-key, sober version,
confirming the same facts.(2)
Israels violent action was the proverbial straw that broke the camels
back; even the wobbly-kneed German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle
had to denounce it and lend his voice to an international chorus demanding
that the illegal three-year Gaza blockade be lifted. Those actions which did
follow, like Egypts reopening the Rafah border crossing and Israels
cosmetic redefinition of what could or could not enter Gaza, led to at least
a formal, partial relaxation of the blockade, albeit at the cost of nine
innocent lives.
Israels immediate reactions are most clinically interesting.
First, the Mossad sent films around the world
via Internet purportedly showing passengers assaulting those Israeli troops
who had descended onto the ship in international waters (to conduct a
passport check, perhaps?).
Then came the announcement that the list of
permitted goods into Gaza would be replaced by a list of forbidden items.
(President Shimon Peres was quick to add cement to the ban.) No sooner had
the Israeli government committed a diplomatic faux pas by refusing entry
into Gaza to German Development Aid Minister Dirk Niebel than Foreign
Minister Avigdor Lieberman magnanimously invited several
European colleagues to visit the Strip.(3)
After rejecting numerous calls for an
independent international investigation, Israel declared it would set up its
own probe, but then Yaakov Tirkel, appointed head of the inquiry,
threatened to resign unless he were granted more powers to subpoena
witnesses.
This gesture may very well have been a piece of
cheap theatre; but, no matter: the point is that the Israeli leadership
stood exposed as confused, stumbling, and in total disarray, one day
engaging in clinical denial, and the next, tossing tidbits of concessions in
hopes of placating its critics.
With its deadly act of piracy, Israel lost the mandate from heaven
that its establishment, and many international actors, formerly believed it
to hold. Although Israeli troops were not shooting their own people, the act
was comparable to Soweto and Bloody Sunday for its political impact.
The Israeli elite miscalculated utterly, and no
mad scramble to control the damage will undo the deed or erase its
consequences. Like the South African apartheid regime of the time, and
segregation in the U.S., Israels 60-plus-year-old policy of discrimination,
oppression, and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians is finally being
acknowledged worldwide as a moral obscenity that can no longer be tolerated.
Israels Ambassador to the U.N.,
Gabriela Shalev
lamented the fact that her countrys standing in the world has sunk to new
depths.
Our situation in recent months, she told
Army Radio on July 11, can be compared to the 1970s, when Zionism was
being called racism.(4)
Indeed.
Bulls-Eye - Iran
Contrary to the mantra repeated in the international press, Israels assault
on the Mavi Marmara was not aimed against Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu admitted as much himself, when he declared he would not allow the
establishment of an Iranian port in Gaza.
This is nothing new.
Whenever Israel has moved militarily against
Lebanon, as in 2006, or Gaza, as at the end of 2008, it was neither
Hezbollah nor Hamas who were the actual targets. In both cases, Israel was
mounting preparations for a strike against Irans nuclear facilities, and
proceeded to knock out - or at least attempt to knock out - those forces who
could be counted on to lead a political and military retaliatory response.
(5)
Here, too, the Mavi Marmara massacre had less to
do with any Palestinian radicals in Gaza or Shiites in Lebanon, than with
Tehran. And it is not out of a desire to stem Irans growing influence
that Israel went into action, but because of its strategic commitment to
eliminate the Islamic Republic as a regional power.
One should never forget what sort of political animal Netanyahu is.
He first came to power in 1996 with a political
platform known as Clean Break, a program to break with the Oslo Accords,
and revert to a policy of confrontation, settlement expansion, land
annexation, and continuing ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian population.(6)
This scenario, articulated in detail in
Netanyahus Clean Break policy, was to unfold against a backdrop of
systematic regime changes in the region. All those governments perceived to
be hostile to Israel were slated for replacement. In point of fact, since
then we have had the second Iraq war, and the changes in Lebanon and Syria
pursuant to the 2005 Hariri assassination.
What remains on the original hit list is Iran.
Thus, it is not coincidental that the
Mavi Marmara affair erupted smack in the
middle of renewed international debate on Irans nuclear program. Israels
contribution to the debate has come in the form of outright threats of
military aggression and offers to the White House it could not refuse:
either you stop Iran or we will.
At the end of April, Defense Minister Ehud
Barak, in the U.S. for talks, warned against giving Iran too much time,
because if it were to acquire a nuclear weapons capability that would
change the landscape of the region and the world.(7)
Arguing that Iran has not complied with U.N.
dictates (to suspend its uranium production, for example), the U.N. Security
Council voted up sanctions on June 9, followed on June 17 by the European
Union.
The U.S. hastened to up the ante with its own
unilateral sanctions on July 2.
Whether or not the new round of punitive sanctions will undermine Irans
economy and social stability, they will decidedly not lead to a voluntary
relinquishment of the nuclear program, as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
among others, has declared.(8)
The more interesting question is another: do
those who are imposing sanctions actually believe that they will produce the
desired effect? CIA Director Leon Panetta, when discussing the new
American measures, stated,
Will it deter them from their
ambitions with regards to nuclear capability? Probably not.(9)
Well, then, does the sanctions lobby perhaps
understand the measures as a means to keep the mad god Israel at bay,
i.e., are they punishing Iran in hopes of convincing Israel that it should
renounce its intended military attack, while paying lip service to military
action as a fallback option?
That might cohere with what reportedly
transpired in the
July 6 meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and
Barack Obama at the White House. Bibi told Fox News following the
talks that he had thanked the President for the new sanctions.
He then quickly added that only the U.S.
commitment to keep the military option on the table would get the
Iranians attention. In tandem, U.S. Senators Joseph Lieberman and
John McCain assured their Israeli audience in Jerusalem that that option
was prominently placed at the center of the table.
Lieberman was quoted by JTA Jewish & Israeli
News on July 8, saying,
We will use every means that we have to
stop Iran from becoming a nuclear power, through economic and diplomatic
sanctions if we possibly can and through military action if we must.
Former Senator Charles Robb and former
general Charles Wald co-authored an OpEd on July 9,
Sanctions alone wont work on Iran,
explicitly threatening an effective, targeted [U.S.] strike on Tehrans
nuclear and supporting military facilities. (10)
Now comes the most relevant sequitur: Are the
sanctions, then, merely the non-bellicose means to further weaken Iran,
economically, politically, and militarily, as a preparation for a major
operation? The example of the prelude to two wars against Iraq is germane.
None of the sanctions that crippled Iraqs
economy aimed at forcing a policy change.
They served only to set up Iraq for the kill.
The Fraud of the
Nuclear Debate
That there is no serious interest on the part of the Western members of the
Permanent 5 (France, Britain, U.S., Russia, and China) in solving the
nuclear issue diplomatically is evident in their response to the brilliant
initiative signed by Brazil, Turkey, and Iran on May 17 in Tehran, and
delivered to the U.N., IAEA, et al.
The proposal is simple and eminently workable.
It asserts the right to peaceful nuclear energy
under NPT rules, then moves to the issue of nuclear fuel exchange. Iran
agrees to send 1200 kg of LEU to Turkey, under IAEA observers, and to notify
the IAEA.
Once the IAEA, Russia, France, and the U.S.
respond positively, a detailed written agreement will be drafted for the 120
kg of fuel to be delivered to Tehran. Iran would deliver its uranium within
one month and expect delivery of fuel within one year.
Finally, Turkey and Brazil welcome Irans
readiness to pursue talks with the 5+1 anywhere, including on their soil.
Before they could possibly have had the time to study the proposal, consult
others, and weigh its merits, France and Russia responded with skepticism,
while Secretary of State Hillary Clinton just said no.
Asserting it was no accident that the
declaration came as we were preparing to move [for sanctions] in New York
and that we had Russia on board, we had China on board, Clinton stated she
was seriously concerned by omissions in the document.
The main omission was reference to Irans
continued enrichment program. Another concern was the amorphous timeline
for Irans delivery of its uranium - although the document is precise on
this.(11)
The series of sanctions followed shortly
thereafter. Significantly, both Turkey and Brazil opposed them at the U.N.,
an act which certainly earned the two governments further contempt.
(Some have pointed to the fact that of all the
ships in the Gaza flotilla, it was the Turkish one that came under attack.
Could this have something to do with the Turkish-Brazilian initiative?)
Build-Up for War
Most ominous in the broader picture are military activities in the region
that would cohere with preparations for aggression against Iran.
Egypt reportedly allowed one Israeli and eleven
U.S. ships to pass through the Suez Canal on their way to the Red Sea, an
apparent signal to Iran. The ships, together with a German vessel, moved
into the Arabian Sea after conducting secret exercises off the shore of
south-western Israel, according to the June 26 Jordan Times.
Citing an Israeli report, the paper said the
exercises included,
interception of incoming Iranian, Syrian
and Hizbollah missiles and rockets against USA and Israeli targets in
the Middle East.
The exercises featured fighter bombers carrying
out simulated bombing missions, and Israeli and U.S. fighter jets practicing
long-range bombing missions.
Some facts of the naval deployment appeared also
in Global Research.(12)
The same Jordan Times cited a Jerusalem Post
article week earlier about Israeli military plans for a new assault on Gaza
preparatory to a military campaign against Irans nuclear facilities.
Such reports should be taken deadly seriously. Again, the precedent of the
military build-up prior to the Iraq wars is instructive. A further
disturbing symptom is the behavior of two important Arab Gulf states. On
June 12, regional press outlets reported that the Saudis had granted Israel
the right to fly over its airspace, to which the Saudis immediately issued a
perfunctory denial.
But one should not forget the perfidious role
played by the Saudis vis-à-vis Iraq.
More alarming was the statement of the U.A.E.
Ambassador to the U.S. on July 6 endorsing a military attack on Iran.
Ambassador Yousef al-Otaiba was quoted by the Washington Times:
I think its a cost-benefit analysis,
referring to the benefits of war on Iran. I think despite the large
amount of trade we do with Iran, which is close to $12 billion
there
will be consequences, there will be a backlash and there will be
problems with people protesting and rioting and very unhappy that there
is an outside force attacking a Muslim country; that is going to happen
no matter what.
His conclusion:
If you are asking me, Am I willing to live
with that versus living with a nuclear Iran? my answer is still the
same: We cannot live with a nuclear Iran. I am willing to absorb what
takes place at the expense of the security of the U.A.E.
He added that talk of containment and
deterrence really concerns me and makes me very nervous, because he does
not believe either would work.(13)
Neocons attending the ambassadors session with
the Atlantic magazine, at Aspen, expressed surprise at hearing an Arab
diplomat endorse military action publicly, although many in the region have
uttered similar thoughts in private. It is no secret that most Arab Gulf
states fear a nuclear Iran and would sit on the sidelines during US-Israeli
aggression.
Clearly, Israel will not make good on its threats without a nod from
Washington. And that is not there yet, at least not officially.
After talks with Barak and Israels military
chief of staff Gabi Ashkenazi in Jerusalem, Sen. McCain indicated the time
had not yet come.
I dont believe we are at the point of
making that kind of decision, nor is the Israeli government, he said,
given the state that Iran is in now as far as the development of their
nuclear weapons is concerned.
When asked by Fox News whether he had discussed
the military option with Obama, Netanyahu danced around the issue, but
reiterated his conviction that Iran must be made to fear such an option.
And Obama? He coined a most curious formulation,
Israels unique security requirements, and pledged unwavering
commitment to Israels security.
When interviewed July 8 for the first time on
Israeli television, Obama indicated the two governments would consult with
one another, not act unilaterally.
I think the relationship between Israel and
the U.S., he said, is sufficiently strong that neither of us try to
surprise each other. (14)
But, one could just as well read this statement
as indicating Obama and Netanyahu did discuss the military option, and from
an operational standpoint.
A number of studies and articles support this
hypothesis. First, back in December, the Saban Center for Middle East Policy
at the Brookings Institution ran a simulated war game involving an Israeli
hit on Iran. The study, written up in the New York Times on March 26,
apparently caught the attention of institutions and officials in the U.S.
and abroad.
That scenario foresees an independent Israeli
attack, which angers Washington.
The U.S. tells Israel to desist, and deploys
anti-missile batteries and cruisers, warning Iran against retaliation. Iran
responds with missiles lobbed into Israel as well as Saudi Arabia, but
avoids any direct attack on the U.S. Hamas and Hizbollah also fire rockets.
The Israel population panics, and many flee, while the economy crashes.
The U.S. finally okays an Israeli war against
Hizbollah, whereupon Iran attacks Saudi oil installations and mines the
Straits of Hormuz. The U.S. sends massive reinforcements into the region,
and, 8 days following the first attack, the war game comes to an end.(15)
One need not wait for advice from an ageing revolutionary like Fidel Castro
to realize that the report smacks of wishful thinking. Irans top military
and political elite have made no secret of their intention - and ability -
to respond to any attack with total counterforce, and against all possible
targets.
But the war games story put the option back onto
the front pages of major media.
Then, on July 19, Andrew Shapiro, Clintons assistant secretary for
political-military affairs, addressing the same Saban Center, boasted that
the Obama administration had raised the level of military cooperation with
Israel to its highest point ever. Shapiro toed the line that current U.S.
policy preferred sanctions to war, but he refused to comment on whether or
not there had been discussion of giving Israel a green light to go after
Iran.
The Wall Street Journal followed up a day later with an article by
Bret Stephens, Why
Hasnt Israel Bombed Iran (Yet)?
the gist of which is that, after the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE)
report had placed the military option on the back burner, Obamas
engagement policy, coupled with the post-electoral chaos in Iran,
redefined options.(16)
Four possible reasons offered for why Israel has
not moved yet are: that they didnt think an attack would be successful;
that they preferred to improve their own capabilities first; that some top
Israeli political leaders would oppose it; and, that they feared a Suez
reaction on the part of the U.S.
A most telling leak came that same week in a TIME piece by Joe Klein,
An Attack on Iran: Back on the Table. (17)
Citing Defense Secretary Robert Gates,
who had ruled out any war in 2008 but was now telling Fox News that a
nuclear Iran could not be contained (a formulation popping up all over the
place), Klein writes that some U.S. military are claiming Iran left them
little choice after rejecting a generous U.S. diplomatic option.
Klein adds:
Other intelligence sources say that the
U.S. Armys Central Command
has made some real progress in planning
targeted air strikes - aided, in large part, by the vastly improved
human-intelligence operations in the region.
An Israeli military source told him,
There really wasnt a military option a
year ago. But theyve gotten serious about the planning, and the option
is real now.
Klein says that he has been told that,
Israel has been brought into the planning
process
because U.S. officials are frightened by the possibility that
the right-wing Netanyahu government might go rogue and try to whack the
Iranians on its own.
House Republicans Call For
Israeli War
This makes all too much sense. Israel is on a war-footing and the U.S. is
poised to at least let it happen.
If the White House has not yet officially issued
an okay, the House on July 23 introduced a resolution, signed by a third of
the members, explicitly endorsing war.
H. Res. 1553 begins,
Expressing support for the State of
Israels right to defend Israeli sovereignty, to protect the lives and
safety of the Israeli people, and to use all means necessary to confront
and eliminate threats posed by the Islamic Republic of Iran, including
the use of military force if no other peaceful solution can be found
within reasonable time to protect against such an immediate and
existential threat to the State of Israel...
Asserting categorically that,
the national security of the United States,
Israel, and allies in the Middle East face a clear and present danger
from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran seeking nuclear
weapons and the ballistic missile capability to deliver them,
...and quoting Obama that a nuclear Iran is
unacceptable, the Resolution proceeds to tick off statements attributed to
Ahmadinejad and alleged Iranian violations of IAEA norms.
It condemns Iran for its threats, pledges
cooperation with Israel,
to ensure that it continues to receive
critical economic and military assistance, including missile defense
capabilities, needed to address the threat of Iran, and expresses
support for Israels right to use all means necessary confront and
eliminate nuclear threats by Iran
including the use of military force
etc.
It would be foolhardy to think these are only a
bunch of arch-conservative Republicans trying to boost re-election
perspectives by courting the Zionist faction among U.S. voters.
The resolution is a declaration of intent toward
war. Neocon John Bolton had defined the role Congress could and
should play in igniting conflict. In the July 13 Wall Street Journal, Bolton
wrote that Congress must support Israeli pre-emptive attacks and justify
them on grounds of self-defense.
He explained that,
having visible congressional support in
place at the outset will reassure the Israeli government, which is
legitimately concerned about Mr. Obamas likely negative reaction to
such an attack. (18)
Is it possible to stop
the rush towards war?
There are two powers that can stop it.
One is the U.S. If, as his July 6 tete-a-tete
with Bibi suggests, Obama has signed on to an Israeli rogue operation,
containing the option of plausible denial after the fact, then the sane
elements in the U.S. military and intelligence establishment must move into
high gear.
The new
NIE is long overdue, perhaps due to
factional strife regarding its contents. If an intelligence assessment were
to appear soon, reinforcing the findings of the 2007 NIE to the effect that
Iran does not constitute a nuclear threat, that could defuse the arguments
in favor of an attack. U.S. military professionals, who know better than to
start a new war now, have plenty of ways of convincing a sitting President
that such folly would lead to doom. The other force that could prevent war
is Israel itself.
This entails nothing short of a revolution in
thinking and/or a political coup.
The war party must be disarmed and discredited,
allowing for a new combination of political factors to define an alternative
policy.
The Backlash
This is not unthinkable.
Since the Gaza war launched in December 2008,
world public opinion has turned against Israel. On March 25, the UN Human
Rights Council, which had endorsed the
Goldstone Report in October 2009 and
forwarded it to the Security Council, voted up a resolution (29 to 6 with 11
abstentions) demanding Israel pay reparations to Palestinians for losses and
damages in that war.
Two months later the UNHRC voted for a committee
to monitor investigations that the Palestinians and Israelis were ordered to
undertake. On March 10, the European Parliament had voted (335-267-43) to
endorse the report and call for its implementation. For the first time, it
acknowledged Israeli violations of international law.
Although from the start Israel refused to cooperate with the commission of
inquiry led by South African jurist Richard Goldstone, and rejected
its findings out of hand as biased, the militarys own investigations
confirmed parts of the U.N. report.
On July 8, the Los Angeles Times reported
that in seven cases, the Israeli military had established
-
that a sniper deliberately targeted
civilians
-
that Palestinians, including youth, were
used as human shields
-
commanders authorized at least three
separate bomb attacks that killed and injured several dozen
civilians who were taking refuge in a family home, a U.N. compound
and a mosque. (19)
Compared to the magnitude of the damage wrought
in the Gaza campaign, such admissions are paltry, but the fact that Israels
military had to impose token disciplinary actions on its own reflects the
power of Goldstones findings.
More cynical was the report posted on the Israeli Foreign Ministrys website
and delivered to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on July 19.
It pledged that the Israel army, having duly
conducted its assessment of the Gaza war, would reduce civilian casualties
in future wars! (20)
The IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) has
implemented operational changes in its orders and combat doctrine
designed to further minimize civilian casualties and damage to civilian
property in the future, as Reuters reported.
In addition to providing protection of
civilians, it would restrict the use of white phosphorous bombs in urban
settings.
Cynical? Outright grotesque? Yes, to be sure. But it is also clinically
significant.
None of this would have emerged without the
Goldstone Report.(21)
Turning Point -
Flotilla Attack
The attack on the Mavi Marmara went too far. NATO Secretary General
Rasmussen demanded an inquiry, as well as Israels release of the ship and
its passengers.
In a special session in Brussels on May 31 the
27 EU ambassadors called for an immediate, complete, and impartial
investigation, access to the passengers, and the opening of border crossings
to Gaza. Rage swept through the Arab world.
Amr Musa, Secretary General of the Arab
League, said the event proved one could not make peace with Israel, which he
labeled a rogue state.
Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri spoke of a
dangerous and insane step, while citizens took to the streets in Beirut
and Amman. Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Chalifa al Thani characterized it as
piracy and demanded an end to the blockade.
Two weeks later, the International Committee of the Red Cross issued
an unprecedented statement saying that the blockade per se violated
international law.
The whole of Gazas civilian population is
being punished for acts for which they bear no responsibility, it read.
The closure therefore constitutes a collective punishment imposed in
clear violation of Israels obligations under international humanitarian
law. (22)
Just what stands behind Israels blockade policy
was the subject of a laudable analysis published in Le Monde diplomatique on
July 9.
Authors Thomas Keenan and Eyal Weizman
examine two new developments in the Israel-Palestine conflict: the
increasing politicization of humanitarian aid and Israels redefinition of
international law as a threat to its existence.
The article cites Israeli officials on the aims
of the blockade: Dov Weinglass, an advisor to Ehud Olmert, spoke in
mid-2007 of putting the Palestinians on a diet, which, however strict,
would not allow them to starve. Israels highest court ruled in early 2008
in favor of guaranteeing those in the enemy area a humanitarian minimum
standard, and nothing more.
Details of the Red Lines set for this diet
appeared in Haaretz: according to a government document, caloric intake for
the Gaza population was to be set at a level just above the hunger line
defined by the UN food experts.
If this is the policy behind the blockade,
clearly any humanitarian aid effort aiming to provide food, etc. comes under
the rubric of a provocation, as deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon put
it, since there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza. As a corollary, Israel
has lifted tax exemptions for NGOs supported by outside forces, and banned
all groups who call for putting Israeli leaders on trial.
The other development concerns Israels attempts to rewrite international
law, construed as undermining its right to self-defense. This is the
meaning, according to Keenan and Weizman, of Israels violent rejection of
the Goldstone Report.
Netanyahu delivered a speech in November 2009,
in which he listed three threats to Israel:
a nuclear Iran, rocket attacks by Hamas and
Hizbollah, and the attempt to deny its right to self-defense.
That, Bibi declared, was the intention of the
Goldstone Report.
He added that he hoped statesmen and jurists
would answer Goldstones approach by redrafting the laws of warfare.
The Coming Implosion
in Israel
The same Le Monde Diplomatique cites a statement by Gidi Grinstein
of the Reut Institute, expressing alarm at the constraints placed on Israel
in reaction to its anti-Palestinian policies.
He wrote:
our politicians and military personnel are
threatened with lawsuits and arrests when they travel abroad, campaigns
to boycott our products gain traction, and our very existence is
challenged in academic institutions and intellectual circles. The
country is increasingly isolated.
And, unfortunately,
Israel has failed to recognize these trends
for the strategically significant, potentially existential, threat they
constitute. (23)
Grinsteins commentary is entitled:
Israel delegitimizers threaten its
existence: Israels enemies are scheming to bring about its implosion by
turning it into a pariah state.
Granted, it is a hysterical outburst, but
nonetheless it contains valuable insights if read from a clinical
standpoint. The author laments Israels military failures in 2006 and 2008,
and especially the offensive on Israels legitimacy following these wars.
His view is that Israels enemies,
would aim to bring about its implosion, as
with South Africa or the Soviet Union, by attacking its political and
economic values... Turning Israel into a pariah state is central to its
adversaries efforts, he warns.
Israel is a geopolitical island. Its
survival and prosperity depend on its relations with the world in trade,
science, arts and culture - all of which rely on its legitimacy. When
the latter is compromised, the former may be severed, with harsh
political, social and economic consequences.
Grinsteins piece was published on January 1 of
this year, long before the flotilla attack.
Since then, the trends towards isolating Israel
and awarding it pariah status have only multiplied. And, increasingly, it is
Israelis and Jewish intellectuals who are fuelling the trend. Henry
Siegman, a former director of the American Jewish Congress,
published an article, Israels Greatest Loss: Its Moral Imagination, in
Haaretz on June 11.(24)
Right after the Mavi Marmara confrontation,
Siegman phoned a friend in Israel, to hear what the mood was. He was shocked
to hear his friend say that the worldwide censure of Israel reminded him of
the Nazi era.
Siegmans analysis is worth quoting at length:
When I managed to get over the shock of
that exchange, it struck me that the invocation of the Hitler era was
actually a frighteningly apt and searing analogy, although not the one
my friend intended. A million and a half civilians have been forced to
live in an open-air prison in inhuman conditions for over three years
now, but unlike the Hitler years, they are not Jews but Palestinians.
Their jailors, incredibly, are survivors of
the holocaust, or their descendants. Of course, the inmates of Gaza are
not destined for gas chambers, as the Jews were, but they have been
reduced to a debased and hopeless existence.
Siegman backs up his assertions with facts about
nutrition in Gaza and childhood morbidity, an obscenity which is,
the consequence of a deliberate and
carefully calculated Israeli policy aimed at de-developing Gaza by
destroying not only its economy but its physical and social
infrastructure while sealing it hermetically from the outside world.
He notes that jokes about the Palestinian diet
are also reminiscent of the Nazi period. Though rejecting any one-on-one
comparison, Siegman recognizes that the essential moral issues are the
same.
His conclusions:
So, yes, there is reason for Israelis, and
for Jews generally, to think long and hard about the dark Hitler era at
this particular time. For the significance of the Gaza Flotilla incident
lies not in the questions raised about violations of international law
on the high seas, or even about who assaulted who first on the Turkish
ship, the Mavi Marmara, but in the larger questions raised about our
common human condition by Israels occupation policies and its
devastation of Gazas civilian population.
If a people who so recently experienced on its own flesh such
unspeakable inhumanities cannot muster the moral imagination to
understand the injustice and suffering its territorial ambitions - and
even its legitimate security concerns - are inflicting on another
people, what hope is there for the rest of us?
Another authoritative Jewish intellectual
warning of impending catastrophe for Israel is Daniel Barenboim, the
Argentine-Israeli pianist and conductor, founder of the West-Eastern Divan
Orchestra, which brings together young Israeli and Arab musicians.
In a full-page interview in Die Zeit on June 10,
Barenboim characterized the flotilla attack as dumb.
Echoing Siegmans idea of Israels loss of
moral imagination, Barenboim raised the question, what has become of the
famous Jewish intelligence? - a phrase, he explains, used by both anti-semites
and philosemites.
Among Israelis there are many intelligent people
with whom one can rationally discuss Beethoven, Shakespeare, or Marx,
but when you come to the subject of
Palestinians, they are totally blind. It is not explicable.
With respect to the political situation,
Barenboim is categorical: the problem is the occupation and decades of
injustice against the Palestinians, not the widespread Israeli
interpretation that it all has to do with the Nazis and
the
Holocaust.
If a Palestinian, whose family has owned a
house in Jaffa or Nazareth since the 11th century, now no longer has the
right to reside there, and this man then hates the Israelis - that has
nothing to do with Adolf Hitler.
As for
Hamas, Barenboims view is that,
If one wants to make peace, one has to talk
to all the factions of the enemy, and adds: What the world has
forgotten by the way: Hamas was a creature of Israel, to weaken Arafat.
His conclusion is unambiguous:
If things continue as they are, Israels
days are numbered. The demographic development shows us that the Jews
will not remain in the majority. What is occurring is apartheid, which
is untenable. And what really makes me angry is that many Israeli
governments, not only the current one, are convinced that they have the
right to kill people, because they do not acknowledge Israels right to
exist. That cannot be.
Israel On The Couch
The sub-text running through the views expressed by Siegman, Levy,
Barenboim, and other Jewish intellectuals is that there is something
fundamentally wrong in Israel, - not merely that its policies are unjust and
in violation of international law, but that there is something unhealthy,
irrational in the Israeli mindset.
A couple of articles circulated on the Internet
in mid-June that made this point explicit. Signed by one Michael K. Smith,
they reported on the suicides of two psychiatrists, one who had treated
Netanyahu for nine years, and the other who had treated Barak (for Security
Addiction Disorder - SAD).
Both accounts, appearing on June 12 and 15,
turned out to be spoofs, but they are symptomatic of the growing awareness
that a clinical approach to the Israel problem makes sense.(25)
Also, they remind us that humor is a powerful
antidote in such cases.
Mosher Yatom, the fictional name given Netanyahus would-be
psychiatrist, left a suicide note saying that he could no longer tolerate
his patients contradictory behavior.
I cant take it anymore. Robbery is
redemption, apartheid is freedom, peace activists are terrorists, murder
is self-defense, piracy is legality. Palestinians are Jordanians,
annexation is liberation, theres no end to his contradictions. Freud
promised rationality would reign in the instinctual passions, but he
never met Bibi Netanyahu. This guy would say Gandhi invented brass
knuckles.
The psychiatrist reportedly suffered a series of
strokes, each in reaction to outrageous statements by his patient, for
example, that Irans nuclear energy program was a flying gas chamber.
An expert in the field, Dr. Rafael Eilam,
in commenting on Massive Attack Disorder (MAD), which is rampant among
Israeli leaders, says this syndrome may account for the attacks on Lebanon
and Gaza,
with both attacks having contributed
substantially to Israels current pariah status.
The article ends with the news of a Free
Israel initiative by psychiatrists worldwide, who want to send a flotilla
with relief supplies for the Israeli doctors and their patients:
anti-depressants for the former and
elephant tranquillizers for the latter.
When the spoofs first appeared on the web, not a
few readers took the opening paragraphs seriously, because there was such a
ring of psychological truth to them.
Anyone who ignores the psychological factor in politics must have been in
hibernation during the eight years of the Bush-Cheney pathology. When sane
military professionals were testifying to the perils of new wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, the neocon faction followed its insane instincts and the bombs
began to fall.
Dr. Justin A. Frank, an American
psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, authored a brilliant study entitled
Bush on the Couch.(26)
Relying solely on published speeches,
statements, and interviews, Frank diagnosed the president as seriously
mentally ill, actually a sociopath. Were Dr. Frank to examine statements on
the public record by Netanyahu, Barak, Peres, Lieberman, Tzipi Livni among
others, he might come to a similar conclusion.
When, at a recent public speaking event in
Germany, I asked the IPPNW member aboard the Mavi Marmara, how he, as a
practicing psychiatrist, would evaluate the mental state of the Israeli
leadership, he quipped that he was merely a psychotherapist, and did not
deal with cases of grave psychosis.
The sooner the world - emphatically including Israel - recognizes that we
are dealing not with politics as usual, but with clinically identifiable
attitudes and policies, the better. The generation of new historians in
Israel, researchers like Ilan Pappe, have done much to deconstruct
the mythology of Israels founding, which is a precondition for defining
a sane approach to overcoming the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
But this is not enough. The Israeli people and elite have to confront that
past as well as the recent and current injustices inflicted on the
Palestinians, and work through the psychological-moral implications.
Continuing outside pressure in the form of U.N.
or European investigative and disciplinary actions does have a palpable
effect.
Grinstein is correct in assessing the
consequences of sanctions and boycotts, including those in intellectual
circles, but he is wrong in thinking that this has come about because the
enemies of Israel are,
scheming to bring about its implosion by
turning it into a pariah state.
It is Israels own anti-Palestinian policies
which have isolated the country, making it, yes, a pariah.
Grinsteins reference to apartheid South Africa
is also pertinent. What forced international firms to pull out of that
country was the worldwide moral censure of apartheid. Not the economic
impact of sanctions, but the moral thrust which occasioned them ultimately
led to the downfall of the racist regime. Similarly, the civil rights
movement in the U.S. was successful, not due to the economic damage done by
its boycotts, but by virtue of the movements moral authority.
The U.S., which was mired in an immoral war
against Viet Nam while simultaneously depriving its own citizens of basic
human rights, had become a pariah in the eyes of the world and its
leadership had to willfully change.
These two cases demonstrate the potential for profound political upheaval
when a people faces up to its moral responsibilities.
They also pose the critical role of leadership.
-
Does there exist in Israel today a
leader with the pragmatic grasp of reality Lyndon B. Johnson had?
-
Is there anyone comparable to Frederik
de Klerk, capable of recognizing that a system founded on injustice
could not morally survive?
Yitzhak Rabin apparently reached that
conclusion.
Who is prepared to take up his legacy today?

21. If Israels elite fears the loss of legitimacy in the eyes of the
world as a consequence of the Gaza conflict, it is just as jittery about
growing calls for the countrys nuclear arsenal to be placed under
international supervision. For the first time, as reported by Haaretz on
May 8, the IAEA was asked to place the issue on its board meeting agenda
on June 7. This came in response to a letter on April 23 by Arab member
nations addressed to IAEA chief Yukiya Amano. Amano, in turn, reportedly
asked for proposals from IAEA member states foreign ministries, on how
to urge Israel to sign the NPT.
When, on May 28, the 189 signators to the NPT issued a document calling
on Israel to join the NPT (and did not mention Iran), Netanyahu
denounced it as faulty and hypocritical. In a statement, he
regretted such pressure on the only democracy in the region (Israel),
while the terrorist regime in Iran which allegedly wants to wipe
Israel off the map, was not mentioned. Bibis response was not
surprising; in an ABC interview April 19, when asked about joining the
NPT, he had answered that was as unlikely as stopping settlement in East
Jerusalem. If the Middle East one day advances to a messianic age where
the lion lies down with the lamb, he said, you can ask me that
question again. (http://www.weekly.ahram.org.eg/print/2010/996/re1.htm).
The U.S. Ambassador to the IAEA in Vienna, Glyn Davies, issued a
statement during the Board of Governors meeting, regretting that the
matter had come up. Singling out Israel for censure is in our view both
counterproductive and inappropriate, it read. Though committed to the
NPT and even a WMD-free Middle East, the U.S. view was that raising the
issue further politicized the IAEA, and presented a distraction from
other pressing issues, to wit, Iran. See http://vienna.usmission.gov/100610israel.html.
