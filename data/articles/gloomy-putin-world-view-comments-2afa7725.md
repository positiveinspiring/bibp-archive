Vladimir Putin's straightforwardness make his remarks in interviews and addresses important to note.
Despite his continued efforts for normalized East/West relations, Washington remains a major stumbling block. Obama and John Kerry say one thing. US policy is entirely different, including pressuring other nations to go along with its agenda, no matter the harm to their self-interest.
"Europe's problem is that it doesn't have an independent foreign policy," Putin explained.
Its nations refuse to assert their sovereign rights when it comes to East/West relations, bowing to Washington's will. On Monday, EU officials announced renewed sanctions on Russia for another six months.
According to the European Council Website,
"(o)n 21 December 2015, the Council prolonged EU economic sanctions against Russia until 31 July 2016."
No objections were made to a decision taken in Brussels on Friday.
Moscow maintains its own embargo on various EU agricultural products in response. Some EU officials publicly acknowledge the ineffectiveness and foolhardiness of measures needlessly harming both sides. European nations wanting normalized relations foolishly take orders from Washington. Putin accused Europe of,
"abandon(ing) part of its sovereignty to NATO's leading country, the United States" - shooting itself in the foot in the process.
His comments are aired in a new documentary film, titled "World Order."
He addressed the danger of nuclear weapons, saying Russia,
"would never swing its nuclear club at others." "I hope no person is insane enough on planet earth who would dare to use nuclear weapons," understanding America's rage for war, its earlier use of these weapons, suggesting this option remains a possible future option.
Putin strongly supports nation-state sovereignty, firmly against any nations interfering in the internal affairs of others except in self-defense if attacked.
"The most important thing is not to undermine legitimate governments, not to destroy their statehood even if it appears to be imperfect," he said. "I think that no one should ever impose any values, which he/she considers to be correct, on others. We have our own values and our own ideas about justice" - in all cases strictly observing inviolable international law.
Clearly indicating Washington, he said some countries "lost a sense of reality," attempting to force their will on Russia, a futile strategy impossible to achieve.
"It is essential for future development to build relations of the so-called geopolitical struggle. The fight is inevitable and it is normal. It is only necessary to conduct it in compliance with the civilized rules." "In relation to Ukraine and the post-Soviet countries in general, I am convinced that the position of our Western partners - Europe and the US - is not to do with the protection of Ukraine's interests, but with attempts to prevent the re-creation of the Soviet Union. And nobody wants to believe us that Russia doesn't aim to re-create the Soviet Union."

US-led unipolarity is dead...
Washington isn't willing to admit it. Hostile relations toward Russia persist. Nothing suggests softening ahead - based on policies in place, not rhetoric, at all times deceptive out of the mouths of US officials. Putin remains firm on combating the scourge of terrorism and supporting sovereign Syrian rights, its people alone to decide their future, not foreign powers. Separately, he sees no change in Moscow/Kiev relations. Washington's coup was disastrous.
Conditions for Ukrainians are deplorable.
"(P)ower is in in the hands of (hugely corrupt) oligarchs," bleeding the nation dry. "(D)industrialization of Ukraine is in full swing."
He expects deteriorating economic relations with Kiev next year.
He signed a decree suspending Russia's free trade with its neighbor, effective January 01.
"(W)e decided not to work with Ukraine as a member of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) free trade zone," Putin explained.
At the same time, he won't impose sanctions. Trilateral EU, Kiev, Moscow talks were last held on December 01. Russia's Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev said all sides failed to achieve a mutually acceptable agreement. Putin continues going all-out for world peace and stability - impossible as long as Washington's rage for war remains unchanged...
