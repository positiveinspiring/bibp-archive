In the past several years, people worldwide are
slowly beginning to shed the web of deceit woven by the banking elite and
learning that many topics that were mocked by the mainstream media as
conspiracy theories of the tin-foil hat community have now been proven to be
true beyond a shadow of a doubt.
First there was the myth that bankers were
upstanding members of the community that contributed positively to society.
Then in 2009, one of their own, Paul Volcker,
in a rare momentary lapse of sanity, stated,
I wish
someone would give me one shred of neutral evidence that financial
innovation has led to economic growth - one shred of evidence.
He then followed up this declaration by stating
that the most positive contribution bankers had produced for society in the
past 20 years was the ATM machine.
Of course since that time, we have learned that,
...and though they have yet to be prosecuted,
-
JP
Morgan bank
-
Goldman Sachs bank
-
ScotiaMocatta bank,
...are all regularly
accused of manipulating gold and silver prices on nearly a daily basis by
many veteran gold and silver traders.
Over the past several years, many of the things
that have been passed on to us as truth both in schools and in the media
regarding financial principles have now been exposed as pure lies.
We are in the process of coming full circle with
the bankers and banks that were once consistently, regularly and deservedly
vilified by US Presidents and US Congressmen in the late 1800s and early
1900s as vipers and thieves and as
evil institutions
that impoverished and ruined the [American] people.
During the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, banking
jobs, due to their high compensation and pay, remained the most highly
sought after positions among recent MBA grads, and Presidents today still
falsely laud bankers for their character (i.e. President Obama on Jamie
Dimon: hes one of the smartest bankers weve got).
However, throughout history, we have often
experienced cycles when the truth predominates for a long period, followed
by a period when lies predominated for many years, and then ultimately
followed by a period when a return to truth was ultimately realized once
again.
Consider the case of Christopher Columbus, who
historian Samuel Eliot Morison correctly identified in 1954, despite
being a courageous explorer, as also undoubtedly an unconscionable murderer:
The cruel
policy initiated by Columbus and pursued by his successors resulted in
complete genocide of native Indians in Cuba, Hispaniola and other
places Columbus visited during his trek across the Atlantic.
However, as time passed, the truth about
Columbus was washed clean by American storytellers, and Columbus
incredulously morphed from a genocidal mass murderer into a hero
admired by millions of American school children
for his
discovery of America.
Consequently, the US government followed up this
revisionist delusional accounting of Columbus by bestowing him with the
honor of a national holiday, Columbus Day.
Finally, as the cycle of truth came full circle
as it often does, and thousands of Americans learned of Columbus's genocidal
activities, the US government responded to this movement of truth by
revoking the status of Columbus Day as an official national holiday in
America.
This week, as we observe a Bloomberg journalist
submit an article titled "UBS
Libor Manipulation Deserves the Death Penalty", I am confident that the
circle of truth about banks and the banking industry's despicable
transgressions against humanity will once again return to its rightful place
as common knowledge among the masses and not just among the few.
Though
the banking elite are now increasingly
being exposed for their criminal activities against humanity in their theft
of citizens wealth, rarely is another one of their greatest transgressions,
their theft of citizens minds and the process by which they target and
transform young adults into docile, obedient creatures through institutional
academia, ever discussed.
Below, please find a video of how children are
targeted at a young age with psychotropic drugs, Skinner operant and Pavlov
stimulus-response behavioral modification, and outcome based education
(OBE) in the institutional schooling system to literally dumb down
the critical thinking skills of young adults and turn them into zombie-like
unthinking robots.
Through behavioral modification and the heavy
use of drugs, the banking elite are not only stealing wealth globally at
this current time, but also stealing the minds of children to ensure that
they will mature into obedient citizens of the state with very little
capacity to exert their free-will and determine for themselves the dirty
truth of the global monetary system and of our consequent enslavement.
If you do not know of the intimate connection
between the banking elite and their foray into, and their control of the
global education system, then the below video is for you:
Until one finds a cause for which one is willing
to risk one's life,
one has not yet begun to understand how life
must be lived,
nor learned what one is truly capable of
achieving.
