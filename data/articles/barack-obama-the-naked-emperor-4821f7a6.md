I am writing this in the last days of 2008 as I
watch with dismay as vast numbers of people across the world, including many
who should know better, have been duped by the mind-game called Operation
Obama.
Even people with some understanding of the conspiracy have said things like:
'Well, at least he's not Bush' and 'Well, at
least it's great to see such a new spirit of hope'.
No, he's not Bush -
he's potentially far more dangerous; and what is the use of a spirit of
'hope' if it's based on a lie? In fact, what use is 'hope' at all?
Obama's wife, Michelle, who I wouldn't trust to tell me the date in a
calendar factory, said that 'everything begins and ends with hope'. Utter nonsense. Hope is a meaningless emotion because its fruits
are always in the future and, by definition, never in the NOW.
Hope is like riding a carousel horse; no matter how fast you go you never
get closer to the one in front. The idea, however, is to persuade you to
stay on the horse, despite the evitable disappointment, in the 'hope' that
things will change.
But they don't because the very system is designed to
prevent it.
That's the way 'hope' is employed by the dastardly and devious - take the
crap we are giving you now in the 'hope' that things will get better (but we
know they won't). Barack Obama is a purveyor of 'hope' because his masters
want the people to accept what they are given now in the hope that good
times will come.
Just do what we demand, oops, sorry, Barack demands, and in return he'll
inspire you to hope that it is all leading to the Promised Land. It isn't,
but, by the time you realize that, it's too late.
What terrifies the manipulators is that people will abandon hope, as a
future, sometime-never projection, and start to demand fairness, justice and
freedom now. To avoid this nightmare they need to keep those desires as
something to aspire to, not to actually have.
Thus, their man, Obama, sells 'hope' as a diversion technique, a holding
position, to keep the masses from truly rebelling. We have no job, no food
on the table and our home has been foreclosed, but at least we have 'hope'.
Phew, thank goodness for that.
'I'm hungry, mum, can I have some hope,
please?'
'I'm so sorry, darling, you can't have hope today, only tomorrow - hope
is always tomorrow.'
'So will I eat tomorrow, mum?'
'We can hope so now, dear, but when we get to tomorrow, we can only hope
it's the next day.'
On and on it goes. That's how 'hope' works. Or
rather doesn't.
Obama's predominant mantra has been 'change'. Indeed, his massively-funded,
record-breaking campaign was based on that one word - change. This is a
technique used by Bill Clinton and many others and it is highly effective
because, at any point, the system ensures that most people are not happy
with the way life is.
So, when you don't like the status quo, 'change'
can be a potent message, even if, like Obama, you don't say what it means.
It has been vital to his success, and that of his controllers, that he has
never specified what his 'hope', 'change', and that other mind-control
trigger-word, 'believe', were referring to in terms of policy and the way
society in general will be affected.
Hope for what? Change what? Believe in what?
To
answer those questions with specifics would have been fatal to Obama's
appeal.
I studied the military/government
mind-control programs and techniques in
great detail for many years during the late-1990s and across 2000, and
the Obama 'phenomenon' is the most blatant mass-mind control operation
you could wish to see.
At its core the plan has been to make Obama the focus of everything you hope
for, believe in and want to change. This is why it has been crucial for him
not to specify and detail what is meant by his 'hope, 'change' and
'believe'.
However, I can tell you what those words mean in the context of the Obama
mind-game.
They mean whatever you decide they mean or want them to mean. The
idea is for you to project all that you stand for onto him and so he becomes
the symbol of you and how you see the world. Specifics would destroy that 'I
am whatever you want me to be' scenario and so you don't get any detail,
just 'hope', 'change', and 'believe'.
They don't want him to be seen only as 'the Messiah'; they also want
him to be Abraham Lincoln, JFK, or Buddha - anyone you
choose to project on him, for he is a blank page, blank screen and empty
suit. Obama is a make-your-own, do-it-yourself leader, a projection of your
own mind. (If you are still asleep, that is. If you are in any way awake,
he's an open book.)
See the video How Obama Got Elected (below video) to see how easy it is to manipulate the
masses. It's child's play....
How Obama Got Elected... Interviews With Obama Voters
from
YouTube Website
'I am whatever you want me to be, for I am
just a projection of you. And I got a big smile, see.'
There is no more powerful way of manipulating
people than to tell them what they want to hear and to keep shtum about
anything they wouldn't like.
Double-glazing salesmen are trained to pick up
in general conversation what their target likes and dislikes and to respond
accordingly in the way the product is sold. The technique is simply to tell
the potential buyer what you have gleaned they want to be told.
Obama comes from the same stable, but on a massively bigger scale and with a
whole network of advisors and controllers steeped in the art of manipulating
minds, opinions and actions.
Obama's written-for-him speeches are not from the heart, but from the
autocue. The 'heart' bit comes from extensive training and his Bill
Clintonesque ability to 'mean it when he says it', a state of delivery that
goes beyond mere acting. Tony Blair was trained in the same way.
But if you take a step back and look at these people dispassionately you can
clearly see the techniques they consciously employ. Blair is the most
blatant fraud in the way he delivers a line, stops in mid-sentence for
emphasis and looks down for fake emotional effect. Obama is a little more
slick, but, from where I have been looking this past year, not much.
And how
have people not seen those cold eyes just above the painted smile?
You can watch his mind working, turning between autocue screens to his left
and right, then straight down the camera for his key messages.
From-the-heart orators don't do that; they are too immersed in what they are
feeling and saying to give even a passing thought to where they are looking
or how the line is delivered.
I worked in television for more than a decade, often reading autocue while a
director spoke in my ear telling me what cameras to look at. I have, since
the early 1990s, spoken my truth on public stages across the world.
I know,
therefore, the difference between artificial autocue delivery and body
language and talking from the heart without a script.
Obama, I repeat, is
coming from the autocue, not the heart.
Obama's speeches are a mass of mind-control techniques and Neuro-Linguistic-Programming,
or NLP, and they are carefully constructed to implant beliefs and
perceptions into the mind of the viewer.
See a description of his
psycho-babble, headed
Obama's Use of Hidden Hypnosis Techniques in His Speeches.
As I keep emphasizing, the whole Obama circus is an exercise in mass mind
control and it has been so successful because so many people live their
lives in a permanent state of trance. All of which brings me to the
parallels with Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and similar regimes throughout
history.
Obama may not look like Hitler, nor sound like Hitler, but the themes are
just the same. Germany was in a terrible state economically and militarily
in the 1930s in the aftermath of the First World War and the reparations
inflicted on the country by the
Rothschild/Illuminati-controlled Versailles
'Peace' Conference in 1919.
From amid the chaos came the man that Germans saw then in much the same way
that so many see Obama today. His name was Adolf Hitler and his oratory and
rhetoric, again supported by a ritualistic presentation founded on
mind-control techniques, made him appear to be the German 'messiah', the
German Obama.
Hitler promised 'change', 'hope' and something to 'believe in' amidst the
consequences of war and financial collapse. He spoke to vast rallies of
adoring followers and a mass movement emerged in support of Hitler's vision
of a new tomorrow.
As the writer Webster Tarpley points out, fascism in its true sense is not
just a Police State imposed by a tiny hierarchy. It might end up like that,
but first it is brought to power by a mass movement from within the people
who have no understanding of what the 'change', hope' and 'believe' they are
being offered really means.
They just know that they want some because, as
with Obama, they make it mean what they want it to mean.
Only later do they
see, to their horror, what they have signed up for...
Obama's America ...
... Hitler's Germany.
There may seem to be a world of difference, but the techniques are just the
same.
Obama is far more dangerous than Bush because he can sell a line to those
who are in the trance while Boy Bush could not do that on anything like the
same scale.
Bush
was a transparent
idiot with no communication skills who
needed massive fraud at the polls to get him officially 'elected'. He could
never be the figurehead to inspire a mass movement of the people to support
some vacuous 'hope', 'change' and 'believe' when they don't even know what
those words are supposed to mean.
But Obama clearly can, because he has.
One of 'his' (his controllers') prime targets are the young, just as they
were with the Nazis and the Hitler Youth Movement. If you think this
parallel is far-fetched then have a look at this video to see how extreme Obama worship has already become for some young people. Hitler Youth was
just the same.

In line with this theme, the WorldNetDaily website reported:
'The official website of President-Elect Barack Obama, Change.gov,
originally announced that Obama would "require" all middle school through
college students to participate in community service programs; but after a
flurry of blogs protested children being drafted into Obama's proposed youth
corps, the website's wording was softened.
Originally, under the tab "America Serves", Change.gov read,
"President-Elect Obama will expand national service programs like AmeriCorps
and Peace Corps and will create a new Classroom Corps to help teachers in
under served schools, as well as a new Health Corps, Clean Energy Corps, and
Veterans Corps.
"Obama will call on citizens of all ages to serve America, by developing a
plan to require 50 hours of community service in middle school and high
school and 100 hours of community service in college every year," the site
announced.'

Obama said in a speech in July 2008 in Colorado Springs that he wanted to
see a 'civilian national security force' that would be as powerful and
well-funded as the Marines, Navy and Air Force.
As Joseph Farah, founder of WorldNetDaily, wrote:
'If we're going to create some kind of national police force as big,
powerful and well funded as our combined U.S. military forces, isn't this
rather a big deal? I thought Democrats generally believed the U.S. spent too
much on the military.
How is it possible their candidate is seeking to create some kind of massive
but secret national police force that will be even bigger than the Army,
Navy, Marines and Air Force put together? Is Obama serious about creating
some kind of domestic security force bigger and more expensive than that? If
not, why did he say it? What did he mean?'
Obama meant, amid the flowery words, that he's not in
favor of either peace
or freedom.
He is a front-man demagogue for the same force that controlled
Boy Bush, Clinton, Father Bush, Reagan, Carter, ad infinitum; but the
difference is that he has been hyped to such hysterical proportions that he
will be allowed to get away with far more than they were, at least until
reality dawns on the mass ranks of his hypnotized supporters.
And, clearly,
that could take some time.
The cabal will be anxious to squeeze every minute from Obama's honeymoon
period and we can expect to see events move quickly after his inauguration
in January.
When I was a journalist 30 years ago, I came across a technique that some
tabloid newspaper reporters would use to get someone to speak with them.
They would work in pairs with the first one knocking on the door of some
distressed family who didn't want to talk with the media. He would tell them
he was from a newspaper he didn't really work for and treat them with
aggression and contempt to make them even more upset.
He would then leave and his colleague would knock on the door, tell them the
real newspaper he was from, and act like Mr. Nice Guy. He would say that he
understood completely how upsetting the other man must have been, but 'if
you will only speak to me exclusively I will make sure that the other man,
nor anyone like him, won't bother you again'. They usually agreed and the
scam was complete.
Much the same thing is happening with regard to Bush and Obama. The
Neoconservative 'Republican' wing of
the Illuminati controlled Bush for
eight years and led the country into foreign wars and financial chaos (bad
guy/problem); now the 'Democratic' wing, led by the infamous Zbigniew
Brzezinski, has brought forth the 'saviour', Barack Obama, to lead us into
the sunshine with 'hope' and 'change' (good guy/solution).
Hence even some more aware people say:
'At least he's not Bush'.
Apart from the unspecified 'hope', 'change' and 'believe', few have any idea
what Obama's policies will be. Public perception comes from having an
'image' of him, or a self-projection, not the fine print because Obama
doesn't do fine print until the votes are cast and even then he will hide it
in his windbag words.
There is an 'image' that Obama is against war, but no he's not. He says he's
against the invasion of Iraq, though we'll see what he does about that in
office. How can a man calling for more troops, including European troops, to
be sent to Afghanistan be against war?
He has also said he is prepared to
bomb Pakistan and use military force to stop Iran building nuclear weapons
and he has appointed Hillary 'Let's bomb 'em' Clinton (Bilderberg Group,
Trilateral Commission,
Council on Foreign Relations) as Secretary of State
and re-appointed Bush's 'Let's bomb 'em' Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates
(Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations).
So that's the 'change we
can believe in', then.
Obama isn't against war at all and, if his controllers have their way, he
will engage the US in even more foreign conflicts with the troops sent to
their deaths, and the deaths of their targets, on a wave of oratory from the
dark suit with the black face who would never go where he's sending them.
He claims to be a 'uniter', which is exactly what Bush said about himself
before he came to office, but unity in and of itself is not the issue.
Nazi
Germany had unity in the early years of the war, but was that a good thing?
What matters is what the unity is designed to achieve and Obama's
much-vaunted 'unity' is to 'inspire' a mass movement to support the
Orwellian plans of the Illuminati.
His constant rhetoric about 'bringing people together' can be used to
justify the 'coming together' of the United States, Canada and Mexico in the
North American Union; it can be used to concede America's sovereignty to the
'coming together' of the 'world community' (world dictatorship); it can be
used to unite the believers in their opposition and condemnation of
non-believers, which is precisely what happened in Nazi Germany with the
book-burning and violent suppression of those who challenged the Hitler
regime.
The potential of Obama Mania is endless when it comes to selling fascism as
'hope, change', 'freedom' and a 'New America', or 'New World' [Order].
Bush and Cheney were transparent warmongers and would always have struggled
to bring in the draft, the compulsory enlistment of people into the military
against their will. But it would not be as difficult for Obama in the
current climate. For goodness sake, he's already talking about compulsory
community service for middle school, high school and college students and
creating a peoples' army in America.
That's why I say Obama is far more dangerous to freedom than Bush.
In the
last eight years Bush could only get part of the way to fascism - Obama has
the potential to finish the job, for all the reasons I have mentioned and
more.
You only have to look at the cabal behind Obama, and those he has already
appointed to his administration team, to see what his 'change' is truly
planned to be.
His mentor, svengali and main controller is
Zbigniew
Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor, and the co-founder,
with
David Rockefeller, of the Illuminati's Trilateral Commission.
Brzezinski has admitted publicly that he began to fund and train what he
would call today 'terrorists' in Afghanistan to oppose the Soviet-controlled
government in the capital, Kabul, in the late 1970s. The idea, he said, was
to entice the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan to protect the Kabul regime
and thus give the rival superpower 'their Vietnam'. The plan worked at the
cost of a million Afghan lives during the Soviet occupation from 1979 to
1989, a consequence that troubles Brzezinski not at all.
Brzezinski's 'freedom fighters' would become known as the 'Mujahideen' and
later the Taliban and what is claimed to be 'Al-Qaeda'. This is the man
behind 'anti-war', Barack Obama. It was common knowledge that President
Carter would do nothing involving foreign policy without the okay from
Brzezinski, the co-founder of the
Trilateral Commission
which chose Carter
for president.
It is one of many great ironies of the Obama presidency that he is demanding
massive troop reinforcements to be sent to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban
terrorists who were initially armed, trained and organized by
Brzezinski,
the man behind Obama.
As Morpheus says in
The Matrix:
'Fate, it seems, is
not without its sense of irony'.
But then, in Brzezinski's case, it is not 'fate', but cold calculation that
has brought it all about. The Poland-born Brzezinski has a fierce hatred of
Russia and that is still one of his key targets, together with China.
And if they are Brzezinski's targets, they are Obama's targets.
The Trilateral Commission and the wider Brzezinski network, including
Illuminati fronts like the Ford Foundation, have now chosen Obama and the
situation will be the same.
Brzezinski will call the shots; Obama's job is
simply to sell them to the people. This is rather alarming when you think
that
Brzezinski wants to trigger a war involving Russia and China. 'Obama's'
policies come straight from Brzezinski's books.
Here is one Brzezinski quote
you might recognize and it was made before Obama ran for president:
'Needed social reassessment... can be encouraged by deliberate civic
education that stresses the notion of service to a higher cause than
oneself. As some have occasionally urged, a major step in that direction
would be the adoption of an obligatory period of national service for every
young adult, perhaps involving a variety of congressionally approved
domestic or foreign good works.'
Now where have I heard that before?
As an Illuminati operative, Brzezinski's aim is to create a world
government, central bank, currency and army - a global dictatorship -
underpinned by a
micro-chipped population connected to a global
computer/satellite system.
He wrote a book in 1970,
Between Two Ages - America's
Role in the Technetronic Era, in which he described the global
society that he and the Illuminati seek to impose:
'The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled
society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by
traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous
surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files
containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files
will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities.'
He also said in the same book nearly 40 years ago:
'Today we are again witnessing the emergence of transnational elites...
[Whose] ties cut across national boundaries... It is likely that before
long the social elites of most of the more advanced countries will be highly
internationalist or globalist in spirit and outlook... The nation-state is
gradually yielding its sovereignty... Further progress will require greater
American sacrifices.
More intensive efforts to shape a new world monetary
structure will have to be undertaken, with some consequent risk to the
present relatively favorable American position.'
And what does his puppet, Obama, now say that Americans have to do to bring
about 'change'?
'Make sacrifices'.
As Mrs. Demagogue, Michelle, said:
'We need a different leadership because our souls are broken. We need to be
inspired... to make the sacrifices that are needed to push us to a
different place.'
You can bet that this will include sacrificing more sovereignty and freedom
on the road to the global dictatorship described by Brzezinski for decades.
Brzezinski's son, Mark, was an 'advisor' to the Obama campaign (doing what
his father told him) and, in line with the American one-party-state, his
other son, Ian, was foreign policy advisor to the McCain campaign (doing
what his father told him). His daughter, the Obama-supporting Mika
Brzezinski, reported the campaign for MSNBC television.
Obama has been the chosen one for a long time, a fact known only to a few in
the deep inner circle, and his relationship with Brzezinski almost certainly
goes back to the start of the 1980s when he attended the Ivy League, and
big-time Illuminati, Columbia University where Brzezinski was head of the
Institute for Communist Affairs.
Obama simply will not talk in any detail
about this period. He has been covertly funded and supported ever since by
the Trilateral Commission and its network of foundations connecting into the
Ford Foundation, for whom Obama's mother worked.
And a question:
Does anyone really believe that someone, a 'man of the
people', would simply appear from apparently nowhere to run the slickest and
best-funded presidential campaign in American history?
He was chosen long
ago by those who wish to enslave the very people that Obama says he wants to
'set free'.
The sources of Obama funding read like a Wall Street Who's Who - Goldman
Sachs, UBS, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan Chase,
Morgan Stanley, and so on. No wonder he went back on his pledge to accept
the limitations of public funding for his campaign and instead took the
no-limit option of 'private' funding.
And those people are going to support a candidate who does not represent
their best interests?? Oh please...
Obama and his seasoned network of professional manipulators, sorry his
'campaign team', sold the lie that he had refused to take funding from
'lobbyists', those who are paid to ensure that politicians frame
legislation, or block it, in the interests of their clients.
But like everything that surrounds Obama, past and present, it's a sleight
of hand and mouth. They funneled vast sums of money into the Obama accounts
through law firms that represent lobbyists and lobby groups.
It provided
'plausible denial' about funding from lobbyists while the money poured in
from lobby interests via third parties.
Then there is the Jewish financier,
George Soros, the multi-billionaire
associate of Brzezinski and closely involved with the funding and marketing
of Obama.
Soros is a former board member of the Illuminati's
Council on
Foreign Relations and funds the European Council on Foreign Relations. In
short, he is a major insider.
You can certainly see the Soros/Brzezinski techniques in the Obama
'revolution' in the United States. It was the complex and secretive network
of Soros foundations and organizations, connected to the intelligence
agencies of the US and Israel, that trained and funded students in the
Ukraine, Georgia and elsewhere in the art of mass protest and overthrowing
governments.
These manufactured protests were sold to the world as 'peoples'
revolutions', but it just so happened that when they were over and the old
regime was removed the new leaders were those waiting in the wings all along
- the puppets of Soros, Brzezinski and their associated networks.
Obama is just more of the same, a big smile with strings attached, and
controlled completely by the Illuminati networks that chose him, trained
him, sold him and provided his record funding.
It was they who kept his many
skeletons under wraps, like the gay sex and crack cocaine
allegations of
Larry Sinclair, and they will continue to do so as long as he jumps to their
bidding.
Obama is just another Banksters' moll prostituting himself for fame and
power, and that's why he supported the grotesque bail-out of the banking
system and why he will always put their interests before the people. His
financial advisors are straight from the Wall Street 'A' list, including
Paul Adolph Volker (Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberg Group), the head of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987 and
Illuminati to his fingertips.
Obama has made him head of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board, which is
dominated by insiders, including its staff director and chief economist, Austan Goolsbee, a close Obama associate from the
University of Chicago. Goolsbee is an initiate of the infamous Illuminati
Skull and Bones Society
at Yale University, which also includes Boy and Father Bush. It was Goolsbee
who told the Canadian government not to worry about Obama's attacks on the
economic effects of 'free trade' agreements because his words were just to
win votes in the election campaign.
Another Wall Street insider, the Zionist Timothy Geithner (Bilderberg Group,
Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations), was appointed by Obama
to be his Treasury Secretary. Geithner was the President of the New York
Federal Reserve Bank, the most powerful in the private 'Federal' Reserve
cartel that masquerades as America's 'central bank', and he is a former
employee of both the Council on Foreign Relations and the appalling
Kissinger Associates.
Obama's Treasury team locks into the inner circle around the Zionist Robert
Rubin, the Director and Senior Counselor of Citigroup, co-chairman of the
Council on Foreign Relations, and economic advisor to Obama. Rubin, a member
of the Illuminati Bilderberg Group, was the man behind Citigroup's strategy
of expanding its risk in debt markets which forced it to be rescued by
taxpayers' money.
The very people who caused the
financial crisis are being appointed by Obama
to decide how to respond to it (more taxpayers' money for them and their
friends).
Rubin was Treasury Secretary to Bill Clinton and was followed in that post
by Larry Summers (Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, Council on
Foreign Relations) - another insider appointed to Obama's team of 'change'.
Summers is a fanatical supporter of 'free trade' (freedom to exploit) and 'globalization'
(global dictatorship) and he wrote a memo in 1991, while chief economist to
the
World Bank, saying that the bank should dump toxic waste in poor
countries because the costs of the ensuing ill-health and death would be
lower.
When the memo was made public, Brazil's then-Secretary of the
Environment, Jose Lutzenburger, told Summers:
'Your reasoning is perfectly logical but totally insane... Your thoughts
[provide] a concrete example of the unbelievable alienation, reductionist
thinking, social ruthlessness and the arrogant ignorance of many
conventional 'economists' concerning the nature of the world we live in...
If the World Bank keeps you as vice president it will lose all credibility.
To me it would confirm what I often said... the best thing that could happen
would be for the Bank to disappear.'
Lutzenburger was dismissed shortly after writing this letter while the
horrific Summers was made US Treasury Secretary by Bill Clinton and now he
has been appointed to head the National Economic Council by Mr. 'change',
'hope' and 'believe' Obama.
It's all a fairy story.
Bloomberg.com reported that the Center for American Progress (CAP), housed
just three blocks from the White House, has become a major source for policy
initiatives for the Obama Democratic Party. Who funds the Center for
American Progress? George Soros.
It is simply the Neocon
Project for the New American Century and the
American Enterprise Institute under another name. Those two organizations
developed and dictated the Bush policy of war and suppression of freedom and
the 'CAP' and others like it will do the same for Obama. The CAP will fit
and Obama will wear it.
In fact, except in name and rhetoric, there is no difference in theme
between the regimes of Bush and Obama.
Bush policy was dictated through
Illuminati 'think tanks' and so is Obama's.
Bush was surrounded by slavish pursuers of Israeli interests and so is Obama.
Mr. 'Change' has pledged his unquestioning support for Israel to the point
of 'pass the sick bag' and his vice-president, Joe Biden (Bilderberg Group,
Council on Foreign Relations),
is a vehement Zionist who makes a virtue of
saying he will support Israel in all circumstances.
Obama has appointed the arch Zionist Rahm Emanuel as his chief of staff and
another super Zionist Jew, Dennis Ross, to be his Middle East Policy
advisor. God help the Palestinians. Ross also served in the Bill Clinton and
Father George Bush administrations.
Oh, plenty of 'change' there, then...
Rahm Emanuel, a Chicago-born Congressman, is the son of Benjamin M. Emanuel,
who was a member of the murderous Jewish terrorist organization,
Irgun,
which helped to bomb and terrorize Israel into existence.
The
Open Secrets
website reports that Emanuel was the top House recipient in 2008 for
election contributions from,
'hedge funds, private equity firms and the
larger securities/investment industry'.
Emanuel was also appointed by Bill Clinton to the board of the mortgage
giant Freddie Mac in 2000 and his tenure coincided with a stream of scandals
and financial irregularities. It famously had to be bailed out by the
taxpayer amid the sub-prime mortgage debacle.
Emanuel, like Obama himself, is an asset of the 'Illinois Combine', a
cross-party network of politicians and business interests that conspires to
manipulate Chicago politics for their own benefit.
Even before taking over
at the White House Emanuel faced calls for his resignation for alleged
connections with the Rod Blagojevich scandal.
In December 2008 Blagojevich, the Illinois governor and associate of Obama,
was arrested over a conspiracy involving massive corruption and moves to
sell Obama's Senate seat in Chicago made vacant by his election to the
presidency.
It is yet another example of the staggering web on ongoing and
infamous corruption in Chicago by the very networks that spawned Obama.
A close friend of Rahm Emanuel is another clone of the Illinois Combine, the
Zionist, David Axelrod, who ran Obama's election campaign and will no doubt
be highly influential in the Obama administration. Axelrod is a veteran of
Chicago politics, one of the most corrupt political systems in the world and
he worked for many Chicago mayors in the 1990s and on Obama's senate
campaign in 2004.
Bill Clinton took his Arkansas cabal to Washington when he became president
in 1993 and Obama is uploading his Chicago mob and handing them key
positions of national power and influence. And these guys don't take
prisoners.
All of this may be many things, none of them pleasant, but 'change' it
isn't.
David Axelrod, Obama's 'narrator' and handler.
Read between the lines of Ben
Wallace-Wells' article, "Obama's
Narrator" (NY Times; April 1, 2007)
for a background on
Axelrod...
Obama is a monumental fraud who talks a good story, but lives a very
different one. He won his first political office as a state senator in
Chicago in 1996, not through the power of his policies, but by coldly
abusing the electoral process.
Instead of running against his opponents and letting the people decide, he
had his cronies challenge hundreds of names on the nomination papers of his
Democratic primary rivals until they were all forced off the ballot by
technicalities. He then ran unopposed.
One of them, Gha-is Askia, says that
Obama's behavior belied his image as a champion of the little guy and
crusader for voter rights:
'Why say you're for a new tomorrow, then do old-style Chicago politics to
remove legitimate candidates? He talks about honor and democracy, but what
honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run
scot-free? Why not let the people decide?'
Why? Because he would probably have lost and Obama isn't interested in
losing by playing fair.
He wants to win by any means necessary. The only
voter-right he's interested in is the right to vote for him. He has also
used his hatchet-men like Axelrod to employ scandal to discredit opponents
to ensure his election when the real scandal is the truth about Obama
himself.
He is a classically corrupt main-chancer spawned from the Chicago political
cesspit.
His close connections, therefore, to seriously dodgy 'businessmen'
and fraudsters like the now-jailed slum landlord Tony Rezko are exactly what
you would expect.
Rezko, yet another snout in the trough of the Illinois Combine, has heavily
funded Obama's political career and that of the now-arrested Rod
Blagojevich, and in return they have supported massive sums being paid to Rezko by Chicago taxpayers to run 'public housing'.
These properties were then allowed to fall into such a state of danger and
disrepair, including sewage running into kitchen sinks, that they were
deemed unfit for habitation by the often black poor that Obama was supposed
to be representing as a Senator. Some buildings were so bad they had to be
demolished.
Rezko also secured appointments for his business associates to state boards
and was eventually indicted for using these connections to demand kickbacks
from businesses that wanted to do business with the state.
Rezko and Obama toured the $1.6 million mansion in Hyde Park, Chicago, which
the Obamas bought at $300,000 below the asking price in 2005 while the
Rezkos purchased the adjoining land at the full asking price. Some of this
land was later bought by the Obamas. Rezko contributed a quarter of a
million dollars to Obama's political career and served on Obama's Senate
campaign finance committee, which raised more than $14 million.
Then there is Obama's close association with the terrorists, William Ayers
and his wife Bernardine Dohrn. In the late sixties Ayers co-founded the
terror organization called the
Weather Underground (also known as the
Weathermen and similar derivatives) and launched a campaign of bombing
public places like the Pentagon and the Capitol Building. Three members were
killed making bombs in Greenwich Village.
In 1970 Ayers was said to have described their philosophy as:
'Kill all the
rich people. Break up their cars and apartments. Bring the revolution home,
kill your parents, that's where it's really at ...'
Mr. Ayers himself comes
from the home of 'rich people'.
Bernardine Dohrn said this about the Charles Manson murders:
'Dig it! Manson
killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, then
they shoved a fork into a victim's stomach.'
William Ayers in 1968.
On the day of 9/11 he told the New York Times that
he didn't regret the
Weather Underground bombing campaign and believed they didn't do enough.
The case against Ayers and Dohrn was thrown out because of then illegal
wire-taps and Ayers is now a professor in the College of Education at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, holding the titles of Distinguished
Professor of Education and Senior University Scholar.
Ayers recruited Obama to serve as chairman on the $100 million Chicago
Annenberg Challenge and they worked together for seven years handing out
grants to the 'educational' projects of people like... William Ayers. They
also worked together on another tax-exempt foundation, the Woods Fund in
Chicago, which awarded grants to Obama's own Trinity United Church, home to
his controversial pastor, Jeremiah Wright.
Obama's political career was effectively launched in 1995, just after he was
made chairman of the Annenberg Challenge, at a meeting at the Chicago home
of... William Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn. They have been connected to his
circle ever since if the truth be told.
The
Chicago Annenberg Challenge, run by Obama and Ayers, didn't fund schools
directly, but instead insisted that they affiliate with 'external partners'
who were granted the money. These turned out to be far-left 'community
organizers' so beloved of Bill Ayers and these groups included the
Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (or
ACORN).
Obama also conducted 'leadership training' seminars with Acorn and its
members began to become heavily involved in his political campaigns. It has
also been behind efforts to 'register voters' (voters most likely to vote
for Obama) and Nevada state officials raided Acorn's Las Vegas office after
election authorities accused the group of submitting multiple voter
registrations with fake and duplicate names.
Among the major funders of Acorn... George Soros.
Obama even refuses to prove that he was born in the United States and thus
qualifies to be President. He claims to have been born in Hawaii, but his
grandmother, half-brother and half-sister in Kenya all insist he was born
there.
'Mr. Clean' Obama has a deeply dirty background, but for now no scale of
evidence will stop the swooning Obama zombies from believing the hype or
burst their reality bubble.
That is going to take hard experience and it
could take some time and a lot of disappointment before they are released
from the clutches of cognitive dissonance and have to admit to themselves
they have been had.
It is the same for all the black people who voted for what they thought was
the first black president when, in truth, he is a man in a black mask
representing the interests of the white-faced Illuminati cabal, the very
families and networks that ran the slave trade.
I don't want to be the bringer of bad news or the thwarter of dreams, but
honesty demands it.
The man is a trickster controlled by super-tricksters. A
sock puppet controlled by bigger sock puppets who serve an even greater and
darker evil. To his masters, Obama is just a means to an end and if it suits
them to assassinate him to trigger civil war and upheaval in the United
States then that is what they will do.
Oh dear Oprah, how will you cope when reality dawns?
But, then, will it
ever??
'What? You mean you're not the Lord?'
I can understand the appeal of Obama because people want him to be what he
claims to be, but isn't.
They are sick of the conflict, the corruption, the
struggle we call 'life' and they want it all to change. But Obama's change
is illusory and represents only the continued transformation of society in
the image envisaged by Orwell.
We will see some apparently good things announced, like the closing of
Guantanamo, to give the impression that Obama means what he says. But keep
your eye on the ball and you'll see how the agenda of the global tyranny is
introduced under the guise of Obama's 'hope', 'change', 'believe',
'sacrifice' and 'coming together'.
It could take two years, maybe much more, before cognitive dissonance (lying
to yourself) loses it current grip on the minds of the Obama faithful. Until
then they will make endless excuses for him (lie to themselves) to keep the
'dream' alive.
But one day they will have to admit, by the power of the evidence before
them, that they bought a dream and got a nightmare.
What a pity they can't
see the obvious now and save them themselves such painful disappointment.
