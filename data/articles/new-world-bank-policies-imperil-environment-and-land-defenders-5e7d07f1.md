# New World Bank Policies Imperil Environment and Land Defenders

The World Bank is expected to
approve Thursday its new "Environmental
and Social Framework" which civil society groups say weakens
human rights protections and will likely endanger the
very communities the safeguards are intended to protect.
At issue are a series of
contradictions which strengthens the oversight authority of the
very governments that are pushing the mammoth development
projects typically opposed by poor, Indigenous and working class
communities.
The likely result, critics say, will
be more conflicts and more corpses, doubling down, as it were,
on 2015, a year which the environmental NGO
Global Witness says was the deadliest recorded year for
environmental defenders, with an average of three slayings per
week, worldwide.
This year already saw the March 3
high-profile
assassination of
Berta Caceres an Indigenous rights
and land defender from Honduras who tirelessly campaigned
against a widely unpopular dam project once funded by the Bank's
financial lending arm, underscoring yet again the violence often
associated with international development projects.
In fact, World Bank President Dr.
Jim Yong Kim was widely criticized after he gave
a talk on April 6 at the Union Theological Seminary in New
York City suggesting that incidents like Caceres' death, which
caused condemnation and mourning around the world, are the cost
of doing business.
Kim said that,
"you cannot do the kind of work
we are trying to do and not have some of these incidents
happen," prompting
a letter from 313 organizations and 31 individuals
condemning the remarks.
In the same speech Kim also said,
"I think our commitment is to
hear the voices of the Berta Caceres's of the world, we have
to."
But activists are skeptical, to say
the least.
"Our concerns have not been
adequately addressed," said Prabindra Shakya, human rights
program coordinator of the Asia
Indigenous Peoples Pact, or
AIPP.
The AIPP is one of scores of civil
society organizations and Indigenous and community
representatives - the Berta Caceres's of the world - who
participated in the World Bank's four year review and
consultation process as it drafted its environmental and social
framework.
Many of their recommendations fell
on deaf ears.
"The result of this review is a
more convoluted, difficult to implement and in places
contradictory set of standards," said Helen Tugendhat, a
policy advisor at the
Forest Peoples Program.
For instance, Helen Tugendhat
explained that according to the new framework World Bank
borrowers, in this case mostly countries, will be solely
responsible for conducting the Environmental and Social
Impact Assessment for projects, which determines whether a
project will have "adverse or significant impacts" on Indigenous
communities, a prerequisite for triggering whether free, prior
and informed consent will be sought by affected Indigenous
communities.
"Affected communities have the
right to participate in such assessments under international
law and in many national laws too," said Tugendhat.
"Failing to ensure such
participation risks violating borrower governments' legal
obligations."
This at the same shifts the burden
of responsibility away from the Bank and allows borrowers,
regardless of their track record of corruption or human
rights violations, to bulldoze their way through projects
without community consent, participation, or oversight.
"This is inviting abuse, given
the bank's track record of lending to some of the
most repressive governments in the world," said David
Pred, managing director of
Inclusive
Development International, a human rights organization.
With regards to labor rights, the
watchdog group the
Bank Information Center pointed out that the new framework,
"includes provisions related to
child labor and forced labor, but lacks reference to core
ILO conventions."
This underscores again how these,
"new standards move away from a
rules-based system, rooted in a commitment to doing no harm,
to a more aspirational and flexible set of standards," as
Pred pointed out.
The World Bank is proving once again
that business comes first and that human rights are an
afterthought.
"The underlying agenda was
clearly to make the bank more competitive by reducing its
environmental and social requirements prior to project
approval," added Pred.
The Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact's Shakya said that this lack of clear and tangible protections
will put land and environmental defenders "at risk and fuel
further conflicts" in countries that will "trample" on human,
labor, and environmental rights, such as,
Pred said:
"The result of all this is a
significantly increased risk that hundreds of thousands of
people who will be
forced from their homes, land and livelihoods to make
way for World Bank-backed development will be impoverished,
inequality will be exacerbated and
human rights defenders will be endangered."
The Berta Caceres's of the world
spoke up, as World Bank President Kim implored, but their pleas
were largely ignored.
Shakya said that,
"it is high time that the World
Bank and other multilateral development banks no longer
enjoy impunity for the destruction they often finance."
But in the World Bank's 72 years,
impunity is the status quo.
We can only hope moving forward that
community leaders who stand up to unfair and unsustainable
development don't meet the same fate of the slain Honduran
community leader and
Goldman Environmental Prize winner Caceres.
