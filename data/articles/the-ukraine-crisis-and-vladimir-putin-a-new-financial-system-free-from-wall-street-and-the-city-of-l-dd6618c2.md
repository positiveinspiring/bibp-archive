Wall Street and the City of London?

The Ukrainian crisis?
It is basically the opposite
of what the media and politicians keep repeating both in the US and
Europe. They say that the so-called International community have
isolated Russia and Vladimir Putin.
In fact it is the real sponsors of the coup d'état and the violence in
Ukraine who are isolated not only morally but also strategically.
And it is Putin, the first leader who resisted and defeated the strategy
of world domination, who is enjoying the enthusiastic support of his
people and the growing admiration of the world.
The
well financed media and politicians do
not want to hear this, but this is the reality. Without exaggeration,
one can compare this resistance to that against Napoleon and Hitler
Only few know precisely how dangerous the situation has been. How close
to a real war.
The incompetent representatives of the 'international community' lost
any sense of reality and deployed the weapons of social destabilization,
armed insurrection, assassination by snipers, a fascist March on Kiev
reminiscent of Mussolini's March on Rome, targeting of the Russian
population.
They intended to give Russia the Libya treatment, and they did not make
a secret of it.
After the assurances given by
George H.W. Bush to Mikhail
Gorbachev that NATO couldn't be used for a push toward East,
successive US governments did exactly that.
Their objective is to surround Russia. With
the smiling hypocrisy of hyenas, they made clear that there was no
alternative but to surrender to the military power and propaganda
capabilities of NATO.
No compromise, no negotiations. Or better when negotiations took place
like on Feb 21, the neo-Nazi gangs in Kiev were incited to escalate the
armed violence and take over the Parliament and Government buildings,
beating and intimidating whoever did not agree.
The Western "diplomats" immediately recognized the neo-Nazi coup d'état
as the legitimate government.
Yatsenyuk, the candidate of
Victoria Nuland, declared himself
Prime Minister while members of the parliament were brutally beaten in
the street, their houses invaded and violated, their families
terrorized
to ensure their support for the democratic process
These criminal politicians even pushed the situation close to a real
nuclear war.
Putin made clear that Russia - which had
lost a large percentage of its population in the war against Nazism and
accepted to see Moscow in flames in order to defeat the superior forces
of Napoleon - was not going to surrender.
That moment was more dangerous than the 1962
Cuban missile crisis.
Putin called their bluff
Then, while the
Crimean (and not only Crimean) population asked for protection against
the NATO-supported armed gangs, the propaganda machine went into full
speed in the West, but it was too late. In this sense Putin not only
saved Russia, but gave a chance to the whole of Europe
like in WWII
The fascist armed insurrection and the Kiev coup were not simply a war
against Russia, they were also a war against Europe. Not the EU
bureaucracy in Brussels, whose loyalty lies with the big financial
institutions, but the Europe of the various countries reduced to misery
and despair by austerity measures and the economic looting of Wall
Street and the city of London.
Ukraine has been destabilized in order to make sure that Europe would be
in a perennial war with Russia.
In fact, both, the interests of Europe and that of Russia, lie in a
common economic plan for the development of the whole area. This is what
was proposed by Putin and by several leaders such as former German
chancellors Helmut Kohl and Gerhard Schroeder.
This is exactly what had to be prevented
with the Victoria Nuland $5 billion 'to help democracy.' And now,
despite all the noises and rhetoric, this is the most obvious direction
to go.
The most important point to understand is that this war and looting
policy is not in the interest of the Europeans or even of the Americans.
This is the big secret that now cannot be covered anymore.
-
The governments of the US and the
European countries are NOT independent entities, they are not
sovereign.
-
They do not have the will or even
the ability to act on behalf of their people.
-
They are controlled by
powerful banking interests.
-
They have been taken over by two
financial centers that do not care for the real economy.
-
They pursue only speculation and
looting.
In response on March 4th
the economic adviser to Putin, Sergey Glazyev declared openly
that if the financial vultures persisted, Russia would create on the
spot an independent financial system which is separate from that of the
US Dollar.
Glazyev explained to the vampires:
'We have wonderful economic and trade
relations with our Southern and Eastern partners. We will find a way
not just to eliminate our dependence on the US but also profit from
these sanctions
If sanctions are applied against
Russia's state structures we will have to move into other currencies
and create our own settlement system. We will be forced to recognize
the impossibility of repayment of the loans that the US banks gave
to Russian state structures.
Indeed, sanctions are a double-edged
weapon, and if the US chooses to freeze our assets, then our
equities and liabilities in dollars will also be frozen
'
This strategy is known as the Financial
Nuclear Option.
It could lead to the end of the predatory
looting system of Wall Street.
The 'Southern and Eastern partners' Glazyev is talking about are clearly
the members of
the BRICS, Brazil, Russia, India,
China, South Africa, the sane part of the world economy, the future.
And it is exactly what the official spokesman of the Kremlin, Dmitry
Peskov indicated in an interview to the BBC:
"Sanctions against Russia could be the
final trigger that will force many countries to create a new
independent financial system based on the real economy.
The world is changing rapidly. How many
civilizations grew and died in the course of history? Who will be
able to resist the pressure of dying systems and indicate to the
people the road toward the future?"
The possibility of a new financial system
independent from the collapsing dollar empire, as consequence of anti
Russia sanctions was also emphasized by an authoritative the Russian
media including RT.
Western sanctions might push Russia to
deepen cooperation with BRICS states, in particular, to strengthen
its ties with China, which will possibly turn out to be a big
catastrophe for the US and the EU some time later.

On March 18, the spokesperson for the
Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, stated that Russia would switch to new partners
in case of economic sanctions being imposed by the European Union and
the United States.
He highlighted that the modern world isn't
unipolar and Russia has strong ties with other states as well, though
Russia wants to remain in good relations with its Western partners,
especially with the EU due to the volume of trade and joint projects.
Those "new partners" are not really new since Russia has been closely
interconnected with them for almost 13 years.
This is all about the so-called
BRICS organization, consisting of
Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. BRICS represents 42
percent of the world's population and about a quarter of the world's
economy, which means that this bloc of states is an important global
actor.
The BRICS countries are like-minded in regard to supporting the
principles of international law, the central role of the UN Security
Council and the principles of the non-use of force in international
relations; this is why they are so actively performing in the sphere of
settling regional conflicts.
However, the cooperation between Brazil,
Russia, India, China and South Africa goes beyond political aspects and
is also demonstrated by dynamic trade and multiple projects in different
areas.
Today, in total, there are more than 20 formats of cooperation within
the BRICS which are being developing.
For example, in February the member-states
came to an agreement about 11 possible projects of scientific and
technical cooperation, from aeronautics to bio- and nanotechnology.
In order to modernize the global economic system, at the center of which
stand the US and the EU, the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and
South Africa have created the BRICS Stock Alliance and are creating
their own development bank to finance large infrastructure projects.
On the whole, despite fierce criticism of
BRICS as an organization with no future, it is developing and increasing
cooperation with its members and, in fact, BRICS is showing pretty good
results.
With the suspension of Russia's participation in G8 and the
strengthening of economic sanctions against Russia, specific industries
may be targeted, including limits on imported commodities.
While the West seeks to hit Russia hard, it is important to notice that
Russia is ready to switch to other markets, including BRICS, with a view
to expanding its trade.
