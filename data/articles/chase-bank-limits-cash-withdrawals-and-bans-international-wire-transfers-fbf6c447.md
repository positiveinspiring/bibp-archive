Capital controls imposed
on small business owners
Chase Bank has moved to limit cash withdrawals
while banning business customers from sending international wire transfers
from November 17 onwards, prompting speculation that the bank is preparing
for a looming financial crisis in the United States by imposing capital
controls.
Numerous business customers with Chase
BusinessSelect Checking and Chase BusinessClassic accounts have received
letters over the past week informing them that cash activity (both deposits
and withdrawals) will be limited to a $50,000 total per statement cycle from
November 17 onwards.
The letter reads:
Dear Business Customer,
Starting November 17, 2013:
- You will no longer be able to send
international wire transfers. You will still be able to send
domestic wires and receive both domestic and international wires.
Well cancel any international wire transfers, including recurring
ones, you scheduled to be sent after this date.
- Your cash activity limit for these
account(s) will be $50,000 per statement cycle, per account. Cash
activity is the combined total of cash deposits made at branches,
night drops and ATMs and cash withdrawals made at branches
(including purchases of money orders) and ATMs.
These changes will help us more effectively
manage the risks involved with these types of transactions.
Another letter (PDF)
received by Peak to Peak Charter School, an Elementary School in Colorado,
states that the option to send both international and domestic wire
transfers has been withdrawn from Chase business savings account holders.
Shortly after we posted this story, other Chase
business customers confirmed they
had also received similar or identical letters.
"Im a Chase customer with both of the type
accounts mentioned and got the letter posted," wrote one.
"I have been a loyal customer of Chase for
11 years and I received the letter for my business and when I called
about this I was told basically piss off and find another bank!" added
another.
Chase Bank later confirmed in a tweet,
"Certain biz accounts will no longer allow intl wire & large cash transactions, but customers can opt for Chase
accounts that do," (in other words accounts that are far more
expensive).
Natural News Mike Adams also confirmed his
company received the letter.
"This is happening, folks! The capital
controls begin on November 17th. The bank runs may follow soon
thereafter. Chase Bank is now admitting that you cannot use your own
money that youve deposited there," writes
Adams.
Meanwhile, financial expert Gerald Celente
said the news was a sign that Americans should prepare for a
bank holiday.
Chase is obviously very keen to make it hard for
their customers to have any kind of control over their savings and is trying
to prevent them from sending dollars abroad, prompting concerns that
Cyprus-style account gouging could occur in America.
The move to limit deposits and withdrawals while
banning international wire transfers altogether is a bizarre policy and will
cripple many small and medium-sized businesses with Chase accounts.
Buying stock from abroad in any kind of quantity
will now become impossible for many companies, while paying employees will
also be a headache. Grocery stores or restaurants that turnover more than
$50k a month will be unable to use their account.
Why has Chase announced such a ludicrous and
restrictive policy change? Speculation is rife that the bank is preparing
for some kind of economic crisis by "locking down" its customers money.
Others fear the move to restrict international
wire transfers is part of a plan to protect against a
near-future collapse
of the US dollar.
Whatever the truth behind the policy change,
Chase really needs to publicly explain its reasoning in order to quell the
speculation.
The banks reputation was already under scrutiny
after an incident earlier this year where Chase Bank customers across the
country attempted to withdraw cash from ATMs only to see that their
account balance had been reduced to zero.
The problem, which Chase
attributed to a technical glitch, lasted for hours before it was fixed,
prompting panic from some customers.
Earlier this month it
was also reported that two of the biggest banks in America were stuffing
their ATMs with 20-30 per cent more cash than usual in order to head off a
potential bank run if the US defaults on its debt.
The image below shows two more examples of Chase
business customers receiving the same letter.
UPDATE
Chase Bank confirmed to Infowars that all
business account holders were being subjected to these new regulations.
Given that even a relatively small grocery store
or restaurant is likely to turnover more than $50k a month in cash payments,
this appears to be part of a wider move to shut down businesses who mainly
deal in cash. Chase told us customers would have to upgrade to much more
expensive accounts to avoid the capital controls, meaning larger
corporations will not be affected.
The bottom line is that banks think your money
is their money and will do everything in their power to prevent you from
withdrawing it in large quantities.
