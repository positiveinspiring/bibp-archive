"Bottom line, every large mainstream news source is in the business of disinformation. That's the heavy freight they transport, every day. Stories with no context. Outright lies. Omission of vital data. Claims of overwhelming consensus' on issues where no such consensus exists. Internal censorship of their own budding investigations into high-level crimes. Disguised partisan opinions. Utter reliance on experts' as sources, who deliver official propaganda as if it were fact. They manufacture reality for governments, corporations, and other controllers of society. And yet many of these outlets are drowning in red ink. They're going broke. The greatest news outlet in the world', the New York Times, keeps refinancing its debt to stay afloat. The powers-that-be must rescue mainstream media, in order to keep broadcasting their false pictures of reality. Who will step up to the plate? Perhaps some social-media Godzilla with CIA connections " The Underground Jon Rappoport

The Underground

From softonic.com, November 15, 2013:
"Reddit is only used by 3% of Americans, so it's right near the bottom of the table. Facebook is the winner, with 64% of the population using the site, and 30% of those users getting news from it."
(See also this journalism.org article: "News Use Across Social Media Platforms".)
If those stunning statistics don't give you pause for thought, consider this: worldwide, 1.25 billion people use FB's mobile platform.
And now, Facebook (FB) has plunged into the news business, with a program called Instant Articles.
The basic set-up: mainstream media outlets put their news stories on Facebook's platform and by that simple transfer, more than a billion FB users will see those stories, absorb them, believe them, accept them. It's a lifeline for traditional media companies hemorrhaging viewers and readers.
The New York Times and BuzzFeed have already signed up.

"Uh I'm a Facebook user. I don't have the energy or patience to go to another site and click on a news article, but now it's great: I can get all my news on Facebook, right there. I mean, the Internet? I'm not even sure what it is. Facebook is the Internet, right? It's my world. My virtual bubble. I live in it "

Facebook comes to the rescue of mainstream news and enables its continuous flood of disinformation. (And also Apple - see "Apple Mind-Control News App is on the Way".)
Well, what is Facebook?
Start here:
the big infusion of cash that sent Mark Zuckerberg and his fledgling college enterprise on their way came from Accel Partners, in 2004.
Jim Breyer, head of Accel, attached a $13 million rocket to Facebook, and nothing has ever been the same.
Earlier that same year, a man named Gilman Louie joined the board of the National Venture Capital Association of America (NVCA).
The chairman of NVCA? The same Facebook $$ angel, Jim Breyer.
Gilman Louie happened to be the first CEO of the important CIA start-up, In-Q-Tel. In-Q-Tel was founded in 1999, with the express purpose of funding companies that could develop technology the CIA would use to "gather data."
That's not the only connection between Jim Breyer and the CIA's man, Gilman Louie. In 2004, Louie went to work for BBN Technologies, headed up by Breyer. Dr. Anita Jones also joined BBN at that time.
Jones had worked for In-Q-Tel and was an adviser to DARPA, the Pentagon's technology department that helped develop the Internet.
With these CIA/DARPA connections, it's no surprise that Jim Breyer's jackpot investment in Facebook is not part of the popular mythology of Mark Zuckerberg. Better to omit it.
Who could fail to realize that Facebook, with its endless stream of personal data, and its tracking capability, is an ideal CIA asset?
Soon after its initial IPO launch, in May 2012, Facebook stock tanked.
On Friday, August 17, it weighed in at half its initial price [down from $42.05 to $21.81]. For the first time, venture-capital backers were legally permitted to sell off their shares, and some did, at a loss.
At that time, I wrote:
"This has the earmarks of classic shakeout and squeeze play. It's how heavy hitters gain control of a company. First, they drive down the price of the stock, then they scoop it up and trade it at low levels that discourage and demoralize the public and even semi-insiders. As the stock continues to tank, they quietly buy up as much of it as they can. Finally, when the price hits a designated rock bottom, they shoot it up all the way to new highs and win big. " The company [Facebook] is too important as a data-mining asset of the intelligence community to let it fall into disrepair and chaos. The CIA and its cutouts will save it and gain more power over it. It's what they've wanted all along."

That was my prediction.
Well, today, after a long upward run, Facebook stock sits at $87.88, four times what it was selling for when it tanked in 2012. FB was rescued, and then some.
From the time Mark Zuckerberg was a child and attended the summer camp for "exceptional children," CTY (Center for Talented Youth), run by Johns Hopkins University, he, like other CTY students, Sergey Brin (co-founder of Google), and Lady Gaga, have been easy to track.
CTY and similar camps filter applications and pick the best and brightest for their accelerated learning programs. Tracing the later progress of these children in school and life would be a standard operation for agencies like the CIA.
When Zuckerberg founded an interesting little social network at Harvard, and then sought to turn it into a business, the data-mining possibilities were obvious to CIA personnel. Through their cutouts, as described above, they stepped in and lent a helping hand.
And now Facebook, having grown to gargantuan proportions, is reaching out its hand - to major mainstream news outlets. To rescue them, so they can continue to bombard the global population with a daily attack of disinformation.
It's business as usual for the intelligence community:
from the earliest days of the CIA, Operation Mockingbird was designed to use mainstream media to promote Agency objectives and hide Agency operations.
By 1953, Allen Dulles, Cord Meyer, and Frank Wisner had gained enormous inside-access to at least 25 newspapers and news services, including,
the New York Times CBS Time Life Newsweek the Washington Post the Copley News Service the Christian Science Monitor
the New York Times
CBS
Time
Life
Newsweek
the Washington Post
the Copley News Service
the Christian Science Monitor
This CIA access was not only achieved through reporters.
For example, the heads of CBS, Time, Life, the New York Times, Copley, and the Washington Post (editor) were brought into Mockingbird:
Bill Paley Henry Luce Arthur Sulzberger James Copley Al Friendly
Bill Paley
Henry Luce
Arthur Sulzberger
James Copley
Al Friendly
This was an all-hands-on-deck enterprise.
And now we have, in the digital age, Facebook, propping up an entire Mockingbird-disinformation media industry in decline...
The CIA rides again.
Consider just a small sample of the major-media coverage/disinformation of the past 7-8 years which has been ridiculed and exposed by alternative Internet reporting:
Fast&Furious, Benghazi, Swine Flu, Obamacare, GMOs, trade treaties, vaccines, the CDC, quantitative easing, unemployment figures, psychiatric medications, Common Core, global warming, NATO, the militarization of police, etc.
It's a much longer list.
The effect has been stunning, in terms of public disaffection from mainstream media. It's long past time for a counter-offensive. And Facebook, with its captive global audience, is spearheading the attack.
It's the latest edition of Mockingbird, and it looks benign.
But under the surface, it's breathing new life into a very old business:
creating false reality for the public.
More than a billion people, most of whom are preoccupied with posting pictures of themselves and talking about superficial this and that, are turned into hypnotic subjects sucking through a pipeline a mighty flow of invented news shaped to appear factual, important, and final.
Passive minds made more passive by data-packet elements of a virtual world pretending to be the actual world.
