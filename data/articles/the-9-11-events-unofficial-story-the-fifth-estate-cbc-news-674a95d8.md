On
September 11, 2001 the world watched in shock
and disbelief as planes flew in to New York's World Trade Center and the
Pentagon in Washington, and Americans realized they were under attack.
But by whom? What really happened?
In The Unofficial Story, the fifth estates
Bob McKeown introduces us to people who believe the real force behind
the attacks was not
Osama Bin Laden, but the U.S. government itself.
Emerging from the dust and debris that day was a movement, known these days
as 9/11 Truth or truthers people who believe that 9/11 was part of a vast
conspiracy and cover-up by a criminal faction within the U.S. government.
As the fifth estate reports, public opinion
polls now show that the majority of Americans believe the Bush
Administration had advance knowledge of those attacks and somehow allowed
them to happen and that one-third of Canadians share the same belief.
In The Unofficial Story, Bob McKeown explores why these questions and
theories are growing in popularity.
Youll meet some of the leading proponents of truther theories:
-
Richard Gage, an American architect,
explains how the WTC twin towers and the lesser known Tower #7 could
only have crumbled as they did due to explosive charges placed
inside the buildings.
-
Others, including Canadian professor Kee
Dewdney, insist that the story of the brave fight by the passengers
of United Airlines Flight 93 must have been a hoax.
But, you'll also hear from others who dispel
truther theories and try to understand why, from JFKs assassination to the
moon landing to 9/11, a culture of conspiracy springs up around certain
historic events.
Despite the difference of opinion between those who blame the hijackers and
those who blame their own government, the real importance of the fight over
9/11 truth is that it may have less to do with the past than the future.
