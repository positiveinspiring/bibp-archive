The State has but one face for me: that of the
police.
To my eyes, all of the State's ministries have
this single face,
and I cannot imagine the ministry of culture
other than as the police of culture,
with its prefect and commissioners.
- Jean Dubuffet
The
New World Order, designed around a
functional police state that is encouraged by continuous popular
cultural messages, is apparent to even the most avid establishment
apologist.
Liberty and freedom, hardly ever mentioned in a
positive light by the mass media, is a direct threat to the ruling
class. The proliferation of degenerate behavior is lauded so that those
who object to such conduct will be demeaned as outcasts of the decadent
society. The imposition of a police state is necessary to coerce decent
people into forced obedience.
Cultural celebrities and icons come and go, but their
art often rings on for good or bad.
Political propaganda, embedded in media projects, has
transcended subliminal messages and now emphasizes in your face
brashness. The breakdown of the traditional value society is so
complete, that what was once viewed as insulting political
disinformation now passes as a promotion for a loyalist NWO drama.
"Instead, Homeland presents a retuned version of
the same unshakeable assurance that, even when things are really
complicated, American values are the fairest, the most right and the
best.
Sure, the series shows US forces doing terrible things:
covering up a drone attack that kills civilians in Iraq;
trigger-happy in a US mosque, leaving innocents dead there, too.
But these are presented as necessary acts in
pursuit of far worse crimes. Homeland's core message is that the US
means well, but sometimes has to do bad things; while the Arab
and/or Muslim enemy doesn't mean well and hence does unfathomably
bad things.
Not much of a progression really, is it?"
When the postmortem of the Patriotic Act era is
dissected, the treason of intelligence community operations will be
written in their full horror.
The police state glorified in Homeland
episodes is meant to prepare the public for the next stage of
centralized oppression. While cable or broadcast TV is so removed from
Little House on the Prairie, todays programming is designed to
facilitate the psychological acceptance of the transition into a maximum
lock down prison society.
In the essay,
Mass Mind Control Through
Network Television,
Alex Ansary warns of the prison industrial complex.
"Turn on your local newscast. You have a few
minutes of blue-collar crime, hardly any white collar crime, a
few minutes of sports, misc. chit chat, random political
jibber-jabber, and a look at the weather that no one is
forecasting correctly.
Is that what happened in your town? And
we're supposed to own the airwaves!
The mainstream media openly
supports the interests of the prison industrial complex. The
stories focus on minority criminal groups, and exploit the real
threat to appear much more dangerous than they are. Think about
the growing per capita number of prisoners in the country.
Then
remember that this is happening at the same time that our prison
boom began.
The police on our streets have created criminals.
The focus is to keep us in a state of fear, that way the
elitists can attack any group they want to without fear of
consequence. This is why the media is continuing to craft the
timeless art of dehumanization."
The cutting edge of mind control has long
included the use of music and lyrics that produce subconscious
meanings. Now the fascist messages in street music indoctrinate not
only the youth but target to reinforce the despotic aspirations of
TSA flunkies.
The article,
The
Transhumanist and Police State Agenda in Pop Music,
provides two examples of globalist messages disguised as
performances by Rihanna and Beyonce.
"In hip-hop slang, the term 'hard'
usually refers to someone who is street-savvy, gritty,
rebellious and who is decisively 'not down with police'.
Hard transposes this term to a military context.
Her
militaristic video features a gang of uniformed men dancing
under the orders of 'General Rihanna'. Weve come a long way
from Public Enemys Fight the Power
it is now Submit to the
Power.
All of this military/dictatorial imagery is mixed
with Rihannas sexy moves and outfits, appealing to the
masses basest instinct: sex."
"
Beyonce
walks on stage with a bunch of men dressed in riot gear
the type of
unit a police state would use to repress opposition during popular
turmoil.
What are they doing in Beyonces performance? Contributing
to permeate popular culture with police-state imagery."
In the follow-up account, you can read the description mentioned in this
report.
"Two recent examples of the perpetuation of the police state agenda
in popular culture are Jay-Z and
Kanye Wests
music video No Church in the Wild and Adam Lamberts Never Close our
Eyes.
In spite of, or perhaps
because of, the fact that these songs are two different genres that
aim to reach two different markets, they both contribute to the
saturation of popular culture with police state imagery.
While the
authorities are not necessarily portrayed as the "good guys", they
are nevertheless there, as if their presence at any kind of public
demonstration is normal."
Contrast this dark brute force portrayal, with an age of optimism and
hope.
The peace and love themes in the music and political actions of
John Lennon offer a rudimentary alternative to the grisly atrocities
that the establishment commits routinely in the name of national
security.
Gangster rap has little in common with
All You Need
is Love.
Rebellion of youth is natural,
but resigned acceptance for submission to the police state is
repression. The thirty-two years since his assassination has been one
long road into oblivion.
Read the "Interview With Investigative Reporter
Jack Jones"
for insights into the elimination of a dangerous messenger of peace.
What
a long way away from John Lennons lyrics in the song
Revolution.
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You'd better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow
Now, transition from the mental liberation of the
Beetle era, and go back and examine the overt war crimes of the premier
American despot, Abraham Lincoln.
Biographer and jingoism jezebel LBJ
groupie, Doris Kearns Goodwins book,
Team of
Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln
served as the backdrop of Steven Spielbergs production of the recent
released
Lincoln
film.
"In the modern Hollywood
narrative, all American history revolves around the Sacred Black
Experience. Lincoln confirms this, bending historical truth to paint the
most ruthless, bloody-minded, strong-willed American leader in history
as some kind of smug, pre-post-modern storyteller croaking gamely
through the difficulties like a paleface Obama sans teleprompter.
The
few Southerners are snarling, greasy bigots, recoiling before the erect,
scowling black Union guards as they slink by during a meeting that led
to the Hampton Roads peace conference of February 1865.
The film has throughout a
sense of hushed awe, as if kowtowing to its own self-evident
righteousness.
There is no balance, no complexity, no sense of inner
struggle or desperation. No opposing arguments. Its simplistic outlook
more closely resembles the popcorn-psychology Avengers or Justice League
rather than the serious historical movie that it clearly wishes to be
acclaimed."
The point of evaluating the worship adoration of the
destroyer of the Republic with the authoritarianism of the newly
re-elected president is to equate the despotism of both of their
regimes.
The imposition of the police state is part of the master plan
to enslave the
inherent
autonomy of free citizens.
The insidious popular culture strips the institutions
of traditional constitutional protections and separations of powers by
diminishing the will of sovereign citizens to fight tyranny. The goal of
imposing savage dehumanizing ruthlessness seeks to spread the
Sons of Anarchy
mindset into positions of authority. The merging of law enforcement into
the ranks of criminal organizations becomes a common occurrence in the
police state environment.
Once upon a time, the peace
officer maintained order and balance. Now law enforcement deems that natural
rights are arbitrary and conditional on obedience to government dictates.
911 provided the excuse to inflict a "War
of Terror" under the
disguise of national security.
The Homeland program scripts
that foster the ends justify the means are repugnant to every liberty
advocate. Each day, the evolving police state is becoming more invasive
and punitive.
A culture that glorifies jack
booted thugs that order innocent citizens around as sinister terrorists
destroys the essence of the nation. The New World Order essentially uses
depressing indoctrination of the inevitability for submission to their mind
game matrix.
The walking dead that accept a
dependent society administered by bureaucratic goons, willingly tolerant a
fate of bondage. Since texting is all the rage and the written language is
sorely deficient, maybe the best way to communicate though the popular
culture is to withdraw from the experience as much as possible.

one contact; you might be surprised with the results.
