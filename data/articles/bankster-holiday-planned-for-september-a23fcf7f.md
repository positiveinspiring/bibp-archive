Bob Chapmans influential
International Forecaster is reporting
on the possibility of a so-called bank holiday planned for late August or
early September.
According to Chapmans sources,
U.S. embassies
around the world are selling dollars and stockpiling money from
respective countries where they operate.
FDR imposed a "bank holiday" soon after taking office.
It resulted in the government
stealing gold from the American people and giving them useless fiat paper
money in return.
Some US embassies worldwide are being
advised to purchase massive amounts of local currencies, writes Harry
Schultz, enough to last them a year.
Schultz publishes the
Harry Schultz Letter, an international investment, financial,
economic, and geopolitical newsletter named as Newsletter of the Year by
Peter Brimelow of Market Watch in 2005 and 2008.
Schultz believes
the global elite are in the process of
engineering an FDR-style bank holiday of undetermined length in order to
sort-out the bank mess and impose new bank rules.
On March 5, 1933, in the depths of
the banker engineered Great Depression,
newly elected Franklin Roosevelt declared a bank holiday that
forced banks closed for four days. Roosevelt then rammed the Emergency
Banking Act through the legislature. Passed by Congress on March 9, the
act granted FDR near dictatorial control over the dealings of banks. It also
allowed the Secretary of the Treasury the power to compel every person and
business in the country to relinquish their gold and accept paper currency
in exchange.
On March 10, Roosevelt issued
Executive Order No. 6073, forbidding people
from sending gold overseas and forbidding banks from paying out gold. A few
weeks later, on April 5, Roosevelt issued
Executive Order No. 6102 ordering
Americans to deliver their gold and gold certificates to the Federal Reserve
bank in exchange for paper fiat money.
In other words, FDR engaged in one of historys greatest rip-offs - that is
until now.
FDR not only ripped-off the American people, but foreigners holding dollars
as well, thus ensuring the Great Depression would spread around the world
like a bankster engineered contagion.
As Schultz notes, another forced bank holiday will likely lead to a formal
devaluation of the already broadsided U.S. dollar.
But devalue against what? The euro?
Doubtful. Gold? Maybe. Or vs. the IMF basket of currencies, which he
feels is more likely.
In fact, this is precisely what the globalist
have in mind. In March, the media reported
the IMF was poised print billions of
global quantitative easing dollars to be dubbed global super-currency to
address the (bankster engineered) economic crisis.
The principle behind it is that
everyone would get bonus dollars and instead of the Federal Reserve
having to print them, everyone gets them, declared Simon Johnson,
former chief economist at the IMF.
Can you say inflation?
It is no secret the elite have envisioned a global currency for some time
now. In 2007, the director of international economics at the
Council on Foreign Relations stated that the dollar and the euro
are but temporary currencies.
It is the market that made the dollar into
global money and what the market giveth, the market can taketh away.
If the tailors balk and the dollar falls, the market may privatize money
on its own,
Benn Steil pontificated.
More like the banksters taketh away - and
not only money but national sovereignty as well because a global currency
will demand an end to monetary nationalism.
Or as Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, has
said,
states must be prepared to cede some
sovereignty to world bodies if the international system is to function.
Mr. Schultz believes a bank holiday would suit
the burning desires of the international bankster elite.
It will lead to nationalization, which is a
polite word for brazen thievery. It will allow the government - owned lock,
stock and barrel by the global elite and run by their corrupt whores and
cronies - to rape secured creditors and bondholders. Nationalization is the
unfettered process of grabbing up of insurance companies, mortgage
companies, banks, medical care, and car companies and handing them over to
the monopoly men.
During the FDR bank holiday, Schulz notes,
thousands of banks never reopened; it was a
face-saving way of shutting them down. I would guess the same would
occur today; thousands have little or no net value, loaded with debt,
bad mortgages.
In order soften the nation up for the coming
pillage, the Obama administration has proposed a plan to give the
privately-owned and unaccountable Federal Reserve complete regulatory
oversight across the entire U.S. economy.
The new rules would see the Fed given the
authority to regulate any company whose activity it believes could
threaten the economy and the markets - that is to say if it threatens the
monopolistic interests of the bankers.
Obamas regulatory reform plan is nothing
less than a green light for the complete and total takeover of the
United States by a private banking cartel that will usurp the power of
existing regulatory bodies, who are now being blamed for the financial
crisis in order that their status can be abolished and their roles
handed over to the all-powerful Fed, write
Paul Joseph and Steve Watson.
The government is ready to hand over
everything to a monolithic private corporation and a gaggle of bastard
banker offspring, that have gobbled up an amount close to the entire GDP
of the country in taxpayers money and figuratively stuck the middle
finger up regarding questions over where that money has gone.
A bank holiday would work wonders for any
regulation the Fed and the bankers have in mind. It would compliment the
criminal consolidation now underway. It would allow them to finally and
formally devalue the dollar and usher in a global super currency of
control and enslavement.
A Bob Chapman subscriber added a little dinger to the prospect of the banks
going dark.
The subscriber claims to have overheard two men
in
FEMA jackets talking with a police chief in California, all who
agreed that the federalization of police around the country - a process
largely complete - will be required if the banks are shuttered in late
August or early September because it will get ugly out there.
No doubt. Because the sort of enduring and polite American who weathered the
Great Depression is now in seriously short supply.
If Mr. Schultzs prediction is correct, we can expect riots in bank foyers
and ultimately martial law to be imposed.
Bank Holiday Coming? Prepare?

From Harry Schultz:
Dear Bob:
Bob Chapmans Intl Forecaster newsletter revealed (5/20) this startling
intelligence (from within US State Dept & embassies):
Some US embassies worldwide are being advised to purchase massive
amounts of local currencies; enough to last them a year. Some embassies
are being sent enormous amounts of US cash to purchase currencies from
those govts, quietly. But not £s (british pounds). Inside the
State Dept there is a sense of sadness & foreboding that something is
about to happen, unknown re a date-just that within 180 days, but could
be 120-150 days.
Bob quotes another source that Panasonic has
told their people to be back in Japan by Sept 09.
Harry Schultz, dean of newsletter writers, has quoted the Chapman
letter of May 30 regarding US embassies being sent large amounts of cash
with which to buy local currencies, to last them a year.
Here is Harrys remarkable take on the
situation:
My HSL suspicion is that the elite plan
another FDR style bank holiday of indefinite length, perhaps very
soon, to let the insiders sort-out the bank mess which is getting more
out of their control every day.
Insiders want/need to impose new bank rules.
Widespread nationalization could result, already under way. It could
also lead to a formal US$ devaluation, as FDR did by revaluing gold (and
then confiscating it). But devalue against what? The Euro? Doubtful.
Gold? Maybe. Or vs. the IMF basket of currencies (which seems more
likely) - and much in the news recently.
Any kind of bank holiday will push the US$
lower, which may be a bonus benefit to their ongoing scenario of letting
the $ fall. Such a fall would get the devaluation they want without
having to declare it. In sum, the insiders want more bank and system
control, fewer banks and a lower US$. A bank holiday would suit all
their needs.
Obviously, you cant open safe-boxes if the banks are closed, so plan
accordingly. All this is speculation, but we have to go with what
weve got, scraps of info that point to certain possibilities. In any
case such a closure will, IMO, come sooner or later, as the worst of the
embedded derivatives are still to be faced.
We are years away from solving them because
the controllers dont want to; their fingerprints are all over
them."
PS: during the FDR bank holiday,
thousands of banks never reopened; it was a face-saving way of shutting them
down. I would guess the same would occur today; thousands have little or no
net value, loaded with debt, bad mortgages.
