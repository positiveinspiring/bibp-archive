Bloomberg's report, "Soros Loses Case Against French Insider-Trading
Conviction," indicates that an appeal based on a "human rights" violation
against Wall Street speculator
George Soros has been rejected by the
"European Court of Human Rights."
Soros, who was
convicted and fined for insider
trading in 2002 regarding French bank Société Générale shares he bought in
1988, has built an empire out of obfuscating global criminal activity with
the cause of "human rights."

global empire of NGOs leveraging "human rights" to cover up
institutional criminality just as he himself just attempted
to use "human rights" to excuse criminal insider-trading.
Soros' disingenuous use of "human rights" is not a strategy
he holds an exclusive monopoly over, but rather one he
executes in concert with very unlikely allies -
Neo-Conservatives of the US State Department-funded National
Endowment for Democracy and its various subsidiaries.
The court's decision in rejecting the appeal
was
based on Soros being,
a famous institutional investor, well-known to the
business community and a participant in major financial projects,
...and thus
should have been particularly prudent regarding insider-trading laws.
The contents of Soros' appeal, based on "human
rights" was not heard, and the details of the appeal not yet made public,
however, it is an illustrative example of how Soros and global elitists like
him leverage the legitimate cause of human rights and freedom as a means to
execute and defend both individual and institutional criminal behavior.
Soros has built a
global empire of networked nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) allegedly promoting "human rights," "freedom," "democracy," and
"transparency."
His
Open Society Institute funds amongst many others,
In
reality these NGOs constitute a
modern day network of imperial
administrators, undermining national governments around the world and
replacing them with a homogeneous "civil society" that interlocks with
"international institutions" run from and on behalf of Wall Street and
London.
And contrary to popular belief, Soros has built this empire, not
against "conservative" ambitions, but with their full cooperation.
It is difficult to find a cause Soros' Open Society Institute supports that
is not also funded, directed, and backed by the US State Department-funded,
Neo-Conservative lined National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and its
various subsidiaries including Freedom House, the International Republican
Institute (IRI) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI).
The Arab Spring
It would be almost four months after the beginning of the so-called "Arab
Spring" before the corporate-media would admit that the US had been behind
the uprisings and that they were anything but "spontaneous," or
"indigenous."
In an April 2011 article published by the New York Times
titled, "U.S. Groups Helped Nurture Arab Uprisings," it was stated:
"A number of the groups and individuals directly involved in the revolts and
reforms sweeping the region, including the April 6 Youth Movement in Egypt,
the Bahrain Center for Human Rights and grass-roots activists like Entsar
Qadhi, a youth leader in Yemen, received training and financing from groups
like the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic
Institute and Freedom House, a nonprofit human rights organization based in
Washington."
The article would also add, regarding the US National Endowment for
Democracy (NED):
"The Republican and Democratic institutes are loosely affiliated with the
Republican and Democratic Parties. They were created by Congress and are
financed through the National Endowment for Democracy, which was set up in
1983 to channel grants for promoting democracy in developing nations.
The
National Endowment receives about $100 million annually from Congress.
Freedom House also gets the bulk of its money from the American government,
mainly from the State Department."
George Soros and his
Open Society Institute also played a leading role in
the unfolding unrest.
Soros, in addition to fully supporting many of the
NGOs in tandem with NED and the US State Department, also funded opposition
groups working well in advance to produce new "constitutions" for collapsed
nations.
In "George Soros & Egypt's New Constitution," it was reported:
"It turns out that the new Egyptian Constitution has already been drafted,
not by the Egyptian people, but by the very US-backed protesters who brought
about regime change in the first place.
A
Reuters report quoted an
opposition judge, who had been hiding-out in Kuwait until Mubarak's ousting,
as having said civil society groups had already produced several drafts and
a new constitution could be ready in a month.
These "civil society" groups include the
Arabic Network for Human Rights
Information openly funded by George Soros' Open Society Institute and
the
Neo-Con lined NED funded
Egyptian Organization for Human Rights.
It appears
that while the International Crisis Group may be turning out the strategy,
and their trustee ElBaradei leading the mobs into the streets, it is the
vast array of NGOs their membership, including Soros, fund that are working
out and implementing the details on the ground."
Myanmar (Burma) & Aung
San Suu Kyi
The entire opposition in the Southeast Asia nation of Myanmar, still known
by its colonial nomenclature in the West as "Burma," is a creation of Wall
Street and London.
This includes the growing personality cult of "democracy
icon" Aung San Suu Kyi.
And again, just as we saw during
the
Western-engineered "Arab Spring," it is a tandem effort made by "right-wing"
Neo-Cons within the confines of NED, and Soros' Open Society Institute.
Image: The 2006
Burma Campaign UK report, "Failing the People of Burma?" reveals the entire "pro-democracy" movement,
including Aung San Suu Kyi herself, is a product of US
and British funding and the building of neo-imperial
networks designed to overthrow and replace the
government of Myanmar.
In "Burmese "Pro-Democracy" Movement a Creation
of Wall Street & London," it was reported:
The most telling information begins on page
14 of 36 of the report's titled, "Failing
the People of Burma?" the report
enumerates the vast resources the West has invested in building a
"pro-democracy" movement,
in tandem with similar disingenuous movements
throughout the region, and indeed throughout the world, and insists that
even more support be given to initiate a "transition" in Burma.
It states:
"The restoration of democracy in Burma
is a priority U.S. policy objective in Southeast Asia.
To achieve
this objective, the United States has consistently supported
democracy activists and their efforts both inside and outside Burma
Addressing these needs requires flexibility and creativity.
Despite the challenges that have arisen,
United States Embassies Rangoon and Bangkok as well as Consulate
General Chiang Mai are fully engaged in pro-democracy efforts.
The
United States also supports organizations, such as the National
Endowment for Democracy, the Open Society Institute (nb no support
given since 2004) and Internews, working inside and outside the
region on a broad range of democracy promotion activities.
U.S.-based broadcasters supply news and
information to the Burmese people, who lack a free press. U.S.
programs also fund scholarships for Burmese who represent the future
of Burma.
The United States is committed to working for a democratic Burma and
will continue to employ a variety of tools to assist democracy
activists."
The report continues with a vast array of
evidence exposing the tandem roles of both "liberals" and "conservatives" in
executing a singular goal of undermining a foreign government and replacing
it with neo-imperial administrators that interlock directly with
"international institutions" that answer directly to Wall Street and London.
Wall Street's Thai
Proxy - Thaksin Shinawatra
Like in neighboring Myanmar, efforts have been long underway to undermine
the nationalist elements within Thailand and install a proxy government as
well as a proxy system of governance to implement the global agenda of Wall
Street and London.
The proxy of choice is billionaire and long-time
associate of
the Bush family,
Thaksin Shinawatra.
As we've seen in the previous two examples, Shinawatra's association with
America's Neo-Conservative establishment in no way inhibits the "liberal"
George Soros from supporting movements that facilitate not only his
re-installation into power, but the expansion of his globalist "neoliberal"
brand of politics - which of course benefit once again Wall Street and
London in general, not any particular political persuasion.
In the example of Thai
propaganda front "Prachatai,"
Soros' Open Society
Institute and the Neo-Cons' National Endowment for Democracy have heaped
annual funding as well as ongoing political support to the outfit's mission
of leveraging "human rights" and disingenuous aspirations for "democracy" to
mask Shinawatra and his movement's criminal activities.
NED subsidiary,
Freedom House, is in fact
chaired by Neo-Con Kenneth Adelman who served as
Shinawatra's lobbyist and also serves as a trustee on the Soros-funded and
chaired
International Crisis Group.
Prachatai's spinning of their collective
agenda as "progressive" rather than one wrought of foreign corporate-fascist
funding is a perfect example of Soros' modus operandi.
Attempted Overthrow of
Russia's Government
In a fourth and final example, Soros and his Neo-Conservative counterparts
can be found behind Russia's motley opposition and their "Arab Spring-like"
attempt to overthrow the government of Vladimir Putin.
The entire grounds justifying Wall Street and London's street mobs were
calls of a "rigged" Russian election.
Those making such accusations included
National
Endowment for Democracy-funded GOLOS and the Soros Open Society-funded
Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE) (page 124).

US National Endowment for
Democracy's (NED) website indicating its funding for
"independent" poll monitor Golos.
USAID also funds
Golos.
And while the lion's share of support for
Russia's multiple opposition groups comes from the National Endowment for
Democracy and its subsidiaries including Freedom House and the International
Republican Institute
chaired by John McCain, jailed Russian oligarch and
opposition leader Mikhail Khodorkovsky fashioned his entire "Open Russian
Foundation" after Soros' Open Society Institute.
It should be noted that Khodorkovsky had both
Jacob Rothschild and
Henry Kissinger chairing his
contrived "foundation."
Conclusion
Clearly there is more behind Soros' funding of NGOs globally than mere
"liberal philanthropy."
That he carries out this funding in concert with
notorious warmongers, corporate fascists, and confessed Neo-Conservatives
indicates a very malicious and disingenuous agenda driving not only his
"charity" but also the maintaining of his deceptive "liberal" persona.
Soros' most recent attempt to leverage "human rights," not for a global
campaign of achieving economic and geopolitical hegemony, but rather on
behalf of defending his own criminal behavior, lends further evidence to the
fact that the West, through its vast networks of NGOs and "international
institutions," is merely hiding immensely depraved, craven criminal activity
behind the facade of "humanitarian concerns" and "progress."
With Soros'
latest appeal being rejected and his criminal conviction upheld, let us
resist the temptation of resorting to "left-right" bickering and recognize
the grander plot that has been exposed.
