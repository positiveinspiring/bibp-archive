Bill and Hillary Clinton have always been participants in the
CIA MKULTRA program (now known as
MARATHON). This report documents Hillary's
crimes perpetrated against former CIA mind control slave Cathy O'Brien.
Cathy O'Brien describes her sexual assault
perpetrated by Hillary Clinton in her book,
Trance Formation of America, at
Swiss Villa-Lampe, Missouri, 1983.
(CORROBORATING EVIDENCE - note then Governor Bill Clinton's conversation
about the drug industry in the first couple of paragraphs and watch the
video far below, and note the satanic 'Baphomet' reference and read a criminal
report below, also with satanic references)

Ex-CIA Tatum on Clinton Coke Lines Through Mena
Ted Gunderson, FBI Senior Special Agent-in-Charge, Los Angeles(ret.),
interviewed CIA defector Gene 'Chip' Tatum in 1998 about the Clinton coke
lines through Arkansas-a month after this interview Tatum disappeared-his
badly tortured body washed up on a Panama beach in early 2007

Note the 'satanic' references in the underlined above text with 'blood ritual,'
'goat head,' 'robes,' and 'altar.'
This U.S. Customs Service criminal
investigation report into the group "Finders" from 1987 corroborates the
'satanic' reference in the Hillary passage when Cathy writes about the 'Baphomet.'
The "Finders" are a CIA group who kidnap and traffic children worldwide for
covert activities. They were investigated in 1987, but when the CIA got
involved, the investigation was covered up under the National Security Act
of 1947.
Why is there a 'satanic' theme?
See the "Finders" report below.
