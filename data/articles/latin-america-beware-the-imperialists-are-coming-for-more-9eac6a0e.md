The history of U.S. thuggery in Latin America to
promote its own agenda and extort their economies and resources is a long
and sordid one.
As documented so well in John Perkins Confessions
of an Economic Hitman, when the U.S. greed machine wants something it
will methodically use any means necessary to get it:
John
Perkins "Confessions of an Economic Hitman"
- Extended Interview 2008 -
Several new yet not so new dynamics have been
surfacing in the news lately that appear to indicate another wave of attacks
in the area is in the offing.
Not surprising. The U.S. march of tyranny knows
no boundaries.
After all, its not just the U.S., its the
fascist global military monster consuming everything in its path and the
bloodthirsty U.S. with its easily persuaded populace makes a great henchman.
The Tip of the Iceberg
When this stuff surfaces, just like the staged
Middle Eastern revolts and various color revolutions, the groundwork has
been getting laid for a long, long time leading up to the final events.
A lot of subversive training takes place as they
ready for the right opportunity to give the peoples voice and start a
rebellion against a regime the U.S. wants replaced.
Just look at this hype, as if everything in the
region is going to blow.
Well, how would they know that unless they were
the ones pulling the strings?:
Death of Hugo
Chavez could set off shock waves across region
The likelihood that Venezuelas Hugo
Chavez is close to death will pitch rivals against one another in a
battle for power and oil riches, and trigger political shock waves
across the region.

A clear set up. Its setting the stage and the
U.S. has the triggermen and detonators ready to activate.
Teeing Up Venezuela
Chavez apparent imminent death is already
bringing the supposed quarreling opposition parties headlines when these
are simple reports planted by
the Rothschild...
controlled media.
But drink it up the Americans will, endorsing
whatever invasive action theyre told is necessary,
to save democracy and protect our
security.
What a crock!
Heres the Venezuela set up piece. Endorsing
this controlled opposition comes next while their man waits in the wings to
be installed.
Foe alleges
conflict brewing between Chavez allies
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP)
An opponent of Hugo Chavez alleged Sunday that conflicts are brewing
within Venezuelas ruling party and argued that alleged differences
between the presidents close confidants have prompted them to seek to
postpone the socialist leaders inauguration.
I highly doubt thats the case. This is a public
media manipulated lobby and excuse to postpone what Chavez set in place so
the ensuing strife can fester and gain mainstream media support.
The Venezuelans and their wishes will have very
little if anything to do with it.
Chavez Has Been a Formidable Opponent to
U.S. Imperialism
The U.S. plans to overthrow Chavez Im sure have
been many more than we hear about, and theres a good chance his cancer was
induced by CIA/Mossad operatives.
Its standard procedure, along with heart
attacks, getting suicided, plane crashes, and the like.
Chavez was supposed to have been taken out after
the staged 9/11 event as
one Rockefeller confided to
Aaron Russo, who
also died of an aggressive
cancer, by the way, after he blew the whistle on all this.
Heres Russos
talk:
Listen all the way through, its one of the
greatest exposes of the cold, calculated elite mindset youll see from a
first hand encounter:
And sure enough, a neocon coup attempt was
temporarily successful in 2002 with the installment of an elite businessman
as President. However, massive pro-Chavez demonstrations that
even drew military support forced the Bush installed government out and
Chavez took back control. (Story
here).
And as you know, theyve been busy demonizing
Chavez ever since, setting up for their next run at taking over the country.
They sure as hell didnt stop trying to
overthrow Chavez there. They just morph and regroup and now with his
probable death you can expect to see the carefully orchestrated media
charade of the rise of the peoples voice against this horrible
dictatorial regime that wouldnt bow to the pressures of the globalist
bankers.
All staged. And they dont care if a civil war
brings Venezuela to ruins.
Theyll get their oil rights and pillage their
banks, as usual if they have their way.
Important Ecuador News
Another thorn in the elites side is the dynamic
leader of Ecuador, President Rafael Correa.
The bankster elite dont take kindly to being
stood up to.
When Correa
offered asylum to
Assange it really ruffled some
feathers. But the closing of the U.S. Manta military base in Ecuador was
huge. He also insisted on a huge delivery of Ecuadors gold from the Bank of
Londons vaults.
And now recently hes working on tax reforms
including the financial sector that are stepping on some serious toes since
as we all know, you dont tax the banksters. (See
here)
Globalists dont take kindly to independent
thought or actions.
And Correa knows that...
Ecuadorian
president warns of possible CIA attack before elections
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa has said
the CIA may try to kill him prior to upcoming elections.
Citing reports
of a plot to destabilize the region, Correa said the threats were
credible, given the history of U.S. involvement in Latin America.
Correa alluded to reports by Chilean
journalist Patricio Mery Bell, who allegedly passed on information to
the Ecuadorian government that President Correas life was under
threat by a CIA plot.
There are many cases of [the CIA] interfering
in Latin American affairs, Correa said during a campaign tour in the
coastal province of Guayas.
These are credible [reports] because this has
happened before in Latin America.
CIA Money Flooding In
Bell first voiced his concerns for the
safety of President Correa three months ago when he released a report
claiming the CIA sought to destabilize Ecuador.
He said that
the threat to Correas life would be at its height from January 15 and
onwards, as Correa applies to run for another presidential term.
We will have to be three times
more vigilant with President Correa, Bell
said in an interview with publication El Ciudadano.
Bell maintained that
although he was not a staunch supporter of Correa, it was his duty as a
Latin American citizen to warn of the alleged $88-million CIA plot to
destabilize the Ecuadorian government.
The journalist believes that this money will
be divided amongst extremist anarchist, leftist and hardline
conservative groups, in the hopes of discrediting Correas.

Nasty...
The Warning Signs are There
This is just a couple of outstanding examples
now hitting the media, but the bankster elites have been making headway into
the Latin lands for decades and already have a stranglehold.
They just
always want more, and to punish those who stand up against them.
Remember theyve seriously bolstered U.S.
military presence in Haiti following the very convenient earthquake, making
it like the Puerto Rico outpost, just a stones throw away as an operational
base to help insurgents in Venezuela.
There are now 13 Latin American
countries where the U.S. either has bases or has funded local bases capable
of hosting U.S. forces.
Not the least of which is Colombia, Venezuelas
rival neighbor.
These buggers take time to set things up to get
the biggest bang for their buck.
Are they going to try to spread unrest
throughout the entire region, as theyve done in the Middle East? If it
suits their purposes they will. However, the Latins are very aware of U.S.
interference so if the Elites push this they may be in for a surprise, as
the Latins have grown more politically savvy over the years.
Not only that,
China has also made serious investments and commitments in the region and
will not sit idly by. How interesting that the Chinese approach to global
influence is expanding economic relationships rather than brute force.
Which influence would you choose in a pinch?
Keep your eyes peeled, and please alert any
loved ones or friends in Latin America as to these designs.
