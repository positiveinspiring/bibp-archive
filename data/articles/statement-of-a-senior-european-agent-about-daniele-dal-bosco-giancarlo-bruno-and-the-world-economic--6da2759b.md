Please note
This statement corresponds
with a statement I have on tape made by a representative of
former Japanese Finance Minister Heizo Takenaka and other
sources.
Benjamin Fulford
My name is xxxx and I am a retired
intelligence officer from the Country of xxxxx. The following took place
during a short period of time during the year 2010 and it is to the best
of my recollection that I state the following:
In February 2010 I met Daniele Dal Bosco in the Hilton Airport
Hotel in Zurich, Switzerland. Mr. Dal Bosco was with Neil Keenan.
Mr. Keenan was with many others who he was working with or trying to
assist in their transactions.
Apparently Mr. Dal Bosco had been told I had been with Intelligence and
he told me that he would like to speak with me privately. Believing he
was a close friend to Mr. Keenan I met with him. When speaking with Dal
Bosco I realized there was a plot in place to steal Mr. Keenan's bonds.
In late May, 2010, I met with Dal Bosco in Geneva who introduced me to
an individual named Giancarlo Bruno from the World Economic
Forum. I extended my business card to Mr. Bruno but Dal Bosco said it
was not necessary and that no one should know the other so well, so
cards were not necessary.
While sitting in the Intercontinental Hotel
with Mr. Bruno many things were discussed with the highly intelligent.
Bruno with Dal Bosco deferring to him for all questions to be answered.
It was clear Bruno was running the show.
Bruno explained how the Davos Program in Davos, Switzerland was a total
success and that what he was going to speak to me about involved the
future and success of Davos which would extend their hand to me.
He went
through a litany of names that he had done business with including Ex
President of the U.S. William Clinton, and ex U.S. Secretary of State of
the U.S.,
Henry Kissinger and Alan Greenspan.
When he was through
puffing so much smoke at me he advised me what they wanted to do with
the Bonds or Notes Mr. Keenan was holding for the Dragon Family and who
was involved.
After reading off names like the Permanent Representative
of Italy to the United Nations H.E. Ambassador Cesare Maria Ragaglini in
New York and Her Excellency Ms. Laura Mirachian, Ambassador Permanent
Representative in Geneva, Switzerland, The Italian Financial Police,
Prime Minister Berlusconi,
Leo Zagami, and others he said to me,
"so you
see there is no possible way we can have a problem. We can cloak
ourselves with the immunity shield and everyone will go away. Just
another day
in the UN!"
I asked him to explain to me what this meant and
he said,
"we want you to get Keenan to give the bonds to us for 100
Million USD. Not one cent more. We have better uses for the Notes than
Keenan would ever dream of nor would he release them to us so readily.
So we need your help!"
Dal Bosco then explained that he had approached
others for help but that Neil Keenan would not move and that the
Sovereign Program was all set up to go with these Bonds and they had to
move quickly.
They were hoping my Intelligence status might frighten
Keenan a bit to releasing the Notes.
While sitting with them in the Hotel Intercontinental I felt
uncomfortable with Bruno making and receiving calls without my knowledge
of who he was contacting thereby possibly jeopardizing my safety, but
approximately 45 minutes after Mr. Bruno started speaking to me a very
pleasant and intelligent woman arrived who called herself, Ms. Laura
Mirachian.
She was introduced to me by both Dal Bosco and Bruno. Upon
sitting Mr. Bruno began asking Ms. Marachian questions that related to
the matter of the Bonds and she said that from the very top we were
protected and there was no reason for anyone, including Mr. Keenan to
worry about any sort of repercussions.
That the Italian cohorts in NY
had even approved this matter with the Secretary General Ban Ki-moon,
"but of course he will deny any such matter if questioned!"
I understood
that this was an all Italian conspiracy to steal the Bonds at this time
with approval being granted to do so by the Secretary General himself,
Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations.
Mr. Bruno at this time advised me
that this is not a very large undertaking in matter of fact it is quite
small in accordance to UN Standards.
He told me the UN was in the
process of confiscating Trillions and Trillions of Dollars in assets
within the next couple of months and that again no one could do anything
about it. I asked if the money was UN money and he said "of course not!"
It was clear they needed my help to get Mr. Neil Keenan to give Dal
Bosco the okay to use the bonds like this seeing Mr. Keenan had already
made Dal Bosco custodian of the bonds according to Dal Bosco. He said
that he could take them and use them without Keenan's knowledge but that
he was afraid they would be asked for and he would find himself in one
bad spot.
Besides, they had future plans with the bonds as well so they
would have to be given over to them so that no one could cause a ruckus
claiming they were stolen from them. Not anyone could withstand such
scrutiny Bruno said so they were trying to buy the
Banco di Lugano in
Switzerland to hide such things as stolen instruments.
I asked who was
buying the bank and Dal Bosco said the Italian Financial Police,
Berlusconi, and others.
They would trade the many instruments stolen
over the years by the Italian Financial Police and trade them from the
Swiss Bank and no one would be the wiser.
They even told me that Mr.
Keenan's friend was involved in the Bank itself.
Apparently the easy way
was for Mr. Keenan to cooperate with the entire scheme already in
motion. The money would never be found, they would be moving to
Paraguay, South America where
the Elite would hide once everything
already in motion began.
The Bush's bought a ranch as have so many
others down there I was told and it would be the safe haven for everyone
involved in destroying the World as we know it today.
Paraguay was going
to be and is going to be the hide out. This was their reward for
destroying the United States and the World. A Hide Out!
To finish off our meeting they called a Cesare Maria Ragaglini in New
York (I saw the number dialed being a NY Exchange) and they asked him if
everyone was ready to do the Bond deal and he said the Powers that be in
NY had no problems with the actions about to be taken so long as some
candy was tossed to them.
Ban Ki-moon was on board and approved the plan
so everything was in place but Keenan. Mr. Ragaglini told me to rope
Keenan in because it was necessary for success.
Supposedly this was my job! Mr. Keenan never gave his approval and the
bonds were stolen in June 2010 (I believe). Compensation was mentioned
for my participation but no exact amount was ever mentioned.
The following is true to the best of my knowledge,
