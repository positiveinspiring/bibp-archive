Yep. In his Essay on the Principle of
Population, Malthus calls for increased mortality among the
poor:
All the children born, beyond what would be
required to keep up the population to this level, must necessarily
perish, unless room be made for them by the deaths of grown persons
To act consistently therefore, we should
facilitate, instead of foolishly and vainly endeavoring to impede, the
operations of nature in producing this mortality; and if we dread the
too frequent visitation of the horrid form of famine, we should
sedulously encourage the other forms of destruction, which we compel
nature to use. Instead of recommending cleanliness to the poor, we
should encourage contrary habits.
In our towns we should make the streets
narrower, crowd more people into the houses, and court the return of the
plague. In the country, we should build our villages near stagnant
pools, and particularly encourage settlements in all marshy and
unwholesome situations.

Malthus thought doctors
shouldn't cure diseases?
But above all, we should reprobate specific
remedies for ravaging diseases; and those benevolent, but much mistaken
men, who have thought they were doing a service to mankind by projecting
schemes for the total extirpation of particular disorders...

Yep.
In his 1968 work The Population Bomb,
Ehrlich stated:
The battle to feed all of humanity is over.
In the 1970s the world will undergo famines--hundreds of millions of
people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon
now.
The United Nations Fund for Population
Activities (UNFPA) was founded in 1969, the year after Ehrlich published
The Population Bomb.
They have been involved in programs with
governments around the world who deny their women the right to choose the
number and spacing of their children. Their complicit work with the infamous
one-child policy" mandated by the government of the People's Republic of
China, uncovered by an investigation of the U.S. State Department in 2001,
led the United States to pull its funding.
The wealthy of the West, in their terror of
poverty, have given copiously to the UNFPA and its population control
programs.

According to the U.N. Population Database,
the world's population in 2010 will be 6,908,688,000
-
The
landmass of Texas is 268,820 sq mi
(7,494,271,488,000 sq ft)
-
So, divide 7,494,271,488,000 sq ft
by 6,908,688,000 people, and you get 1084.76 sq
ft/person
-
That's approximately a 33' x 33' (about
10 x 10 meters = 100 m2) plot of land
for every person on the planet, enough space for a town house
Given an average four person family, every
family would have a 66' x 66' plot of land, which would comfortably provide
a single family home and yard - and all of them fit on a landmass the size
of Texas.
Admittedly, it'd basically be one massive
subdivision, but Texas is a tiny portion of the inhabitable Earth.
Such an arrangement would leave the
entire rest of the world vacant. There's plenty of space for
humanity.
While they
provide Low, Medium, and High Variants, the Low Variant is the one that
keeps coming true, so the Low variant numbers are the ones used in this
video.
Check their
online database.
According to the U.N. Population Database,
using the historically accurate low variant projection, the
Earth's population will only add another billion people or so over the next
thirty years, peaking around 8.02 billion people in the
year 2040, and then
it will begin to decline.
