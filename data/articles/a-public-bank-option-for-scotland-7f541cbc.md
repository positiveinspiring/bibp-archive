Scottish voters will go to the polls on
September 18th to decide whether Scotland should become an
independent country.
As video blogger
Ian R. Crane colorfully puts the issues and possibilities (below
video):
[T]he People of Scotland have an opportunity
to extricate themselves from the socio-psychopathic global corporatists
and the temple of outrageous and excessive abject materialism. However,
it is not going to be an easy ride...
If Alex Salmond and the SNP [Scottish
National Party] are serious about keeping the Pound Sterling as the
Currency of Scotland, there will be no independence.
Likewise if Scotland embraces the Euro,
Scotland will rapidly become a vassal state of the Euro-Federalists, who
will asset strip the nation in the same way that,
-
Greece
-
Ireland
-
Portugal
-
Spain,
...have been stripped of their entire national wealth
and much of their national identity.
To achieve true independence, Crane suggests the
following, among other mandates:
-
Establish an independent Central Bank of
Scotland.
-
Issue a new Scottish (Debt Free)
Currency.
-
Settle any outstanding debt with new
Scottish Currency.
-
Take Scotland out of the EU.
-
Take Scotland out of NATO.
-
Establish strict currency controls for
the first 3 years of independence.
-
Nationalize the Scottish oil & gas
industry.
-
Re-take control of the National Health
Service.
-
Establish a State Employment Agency to
provide work/training for all able-bodied residents.
Arguments against independence include that
Scotlands levels of public spending, which are higher than in the rest of
the UK, would be difficult to sustain without raising taxes.
But that assumes the existing UK/EU investment
regime.
If Scotland were to say,
"Were starting a new round based on our own
assets, via our own new bank," exciting things might be achieved.
A publicly-owned bank with a mandate to serve
the interests of the Scottish people could help give the newly independent
country true economic sovereignty.
I wrote on that possibility in December 2012,
after doing a PowerPoint on it at the Royal Society of Arts in Edinburgh.
That presentation was followed by one by public sector consultant Ralph
Leishman, who made the proposal concrete with facts and figures.
He
suggested that the Scottish Investment Bank (SIB) be licensed as a
depository bank on the model of the state-owned Bank of North Dakota.
Im reposting the bulk of that article here, in
hopes of adding to the current debate.
From Revolving Fund to
Credit Machine - What Scotland Could Do with Its Own Bank
The SIB is a division of Scottish Enterprise
(SE), a government body that encourages economic development, enterprise,
innovation and investment in business. The SIB provides public sector
funding through the Scottish Loan Fund.
As noted in a September 2011 government report
titled "Government Economic Strategy":
[S]ecuring affordable finance
remains a considerable challenge and further action is needed to ensure
that viable businesses have access to the funding they require to grow
and support jobs.
The recovery is being held back by limited
private sector investment - indeed, overall investment in the UK remains
some 15% below pre-recession levels.
Evidence shows that while many large
companies have significant cash holdings or can access capital markets
directly, for most Small and Medium-sized companies bank lending remains
the key source of finance.
Unblocking this is key to helping the
recovery gain traction.
The limitation of a public loan fund is that the
money can be lent only to one borrower at a time.
Invested as capital in a bank, on the other
hand, public funds can be leveraged into nearly ten times that sum in loans.
Liquidity to cover the loans comes from deposits, which remain in the bank,
available for the use of the depositors.
As observed by Kurt Von Mettenheim, et
al., in a 2008 report titled
Government Banking - New Perspectives on Sustainable
Development and Social Inclusion from Europe and South America
(Konrad Adenauer Foundation), at page 196:
[I]n terms of public policy, government
banks can do more for less: Almost ten times more if one compares cash
used as capital reserves by banks to other policies that require
budgetary outflows.
In 2012, according to Leishman, the SIB had
investment funds of £23.2 million from the Scottish government.
Rounding this to £25 million, a public
depository bank could have sufficient capital to back £250 million in loans.
For deposits to cover the loans, the Scottish Government then had £125
million on deposit with private banks, earning very little or no interest.
Adding the revenues of just 14% of Scotlands
local governments would provide another £125 million, reaching the needed
deposit total of £250 million.
The Model of the Bank of
North Dakota
What the government could do with its own bank,
following the model of the Bank of North Dakota (BND),
was summarized by Alf Young in a follow-up article in
the Scotsman.
He noted that North Dakota is currently the only
U.S. state to own its own depository bank. The BND was founded in 1919 by
Norwegian and other immigrants, who were determined, through their
Non-Partisan League, to stop rapacious Wall Street money men foreclosing on
their farms.
Young observed that all state revenues must be
deposited with the BND by law. The bank pays no bonuses, fees or
commissions; does no advertising; and maintains no branches beyond the main
office in Bismarck.
The bank offers cheap credit lines to state and
local government agencies. There are low-interest loans for designated
project finance.
The BND underwrites municipal bonds, funds
disaster relief and supports student loans. It partners with local
commercial banks to increase lending across the state and pays competitive
interest rates on state deposits.
For the past ten years, it has been paying a
dividend to the state, with a quite small population of about 680,000, of
some $30 million (£18.7 million) a year.
Young wrote:
Intriguingly, North Dakota has not suffered
the way much of the rest of the US - indeed much of the western
industrialized world - has, from the banking crash and credit crunch of
2008; the subsequent economic slump; and the sovereign debt crisis that
has afflicted so many.
With an economy based on farming and oil, it has
one of the lowest unemployment rates in the US, a rising population and
a state budget surplus that is expected to hit $1.6bn by next July.
By
then North Dakotas legacy fund is forecast to have swollen to around
$1.2bn.
With that kind of resilience, its little
wonder that twenty American states, some of them close to bankruptcy,
are at various stages of legislating to form their own state-owned banks
on the North Dakota model. Theres a long-standing tradition of such
institutions elsewhere too. Australia had a publicly-owned bank offering
credit for infrastructure as early as 1912.
New Zealand had one
operating in the housing field in the 1930s. Up until 1974, the federal
government in Canada borrowed from the Bank of Canada, effectively
interest-free.
...From our western perspective, we tend
to forget that, globally, around 40 per cent of banks are already
publicly owned, many of them concentrated in
the BRIC economies, Brazil,
Russia, India and China.
Banking is not just a market good or service.
It
is a vital part of societal infrastructure, which properly belongs in the
public sector. By taking banking back, local governments could regain
control of that very large slice (up to 40 per cent) of every public budget
that currently goes to interest charged to finance investment programs
through the private sector.
Recent academic studies by von
Mettenheim et al. and Andrianova
et al. show that countries with high degrees of government ownership of
banking have grown much faster in the last decade than countries where
banking is historically concentrated in the private sector.
Government banks
are also LESS corrupt and, surprisingly, have been MORE profitable in recent
years than private banks.
Young wrote:
Given the massive price we have all paid for
our debt-fuelled crash, surely there is scope for a more fundamental
re-think about what we really want from our banks and what structures of
ownership are best suited to deliver on those aspirations?...
As we left Thursdays seminar, I asked
another member of the audience, someone with more than thirty years
experience as a corporate financier, whether the concept of a
publicly-owned bank has any chance of getting off the ground here.
"Ive
no doubt it will happen," came the surprise response. "When I look at
the way our collective addiction to debt has ballooned in my lifetime,
Id even say its inevitable".
The Scots are full of surprises, and
independence is in their blood. Recall the heroic battles of William Wallace
and Robert the Bruce memorialized by Hollywood in the Academy Award winning
movie Braveheart.
Perhaps the Scots will blaze a trail for economic
sovereignty in Europe, just as North Dakotans did in the U.S.
A
publicly-owned bank could help Scotland take control of its own economic
destiny, by avoiding unnecessary debt to a private banking system that has
become a burden to the economy rather than a pillar in its support.
