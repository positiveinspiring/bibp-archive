BRICS member-states are preparing a world
banking revolution.
They are planning to nominate an alternative
candidate for the post of the Chairman of
the World Bank for the first time
in history. BRICS also demands redistribution of quotas in
the International
Monetary Fund in the near future and intends to study Indias initiative on
creating a South-South Bank.
Representatives of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa proposed a
reform of the world financial system at their meeting in Mexico City which
took place during the conference of
G20 finance ministers and heads of
central banks.
BRICS financiers are annoyed with the private rule that the head of the
World Bank is always a representative of the US. They believe that
candidates should be assessed based on their merits and not citizenship.
BRICS member-states are convinced that it is
essential to create competition for the US candidate, either from a BRICS
country or from Europe. It has been decided to prepare a declaration on a
coordinated position on this subject in the next two weeks.
Candidates for
the post of the head of the World Bank should be determined by the 23rd of
March.
On the 29th of March BRICS leaders are expected to launch the mechanism of
coordinating opinions on Indias proposal
to create a South-South Bank. It
is to become a support institution for countries with developing markets.
BRICS member-states will be playing the main
role in it, according to the quotas of votes. In this context they will have
to assume serious financial responsibilities.
The project looks promising but needs detailed
studying, President of the Russian Financial Corporation Andrey Nechayev
says.
"There are a lot of unanswered questions at
the moment. Who is going to provide capitals for this bank? Who will be
able to get money from it?
There may be a lot more of those who want to
take a loan than those willing to give loans. The new institution meets
the requirements of world development.
BRICS member-states need investments and not
only cash but new technologies, methods of corporate management and
innovations. At present it is not quite clear how this bank, if it ever
opens, will help to solve this problem.
In any case, Indias initiative on creating a
South-South Bank is an attempt by BRICS member-states to offer their mite to
the establishment of a new world financial system.
They are planning to take a place in it
according to their global weight. The rate of the Brazilian, Russian,
Indian, Chinese and South African growing economies in world production
exceeds 21% and these countries currency reserves exceed $4trln.
The latter fact gives these countries grounds to dispute the financial
tradition set by the west.
BRICS member-states intend to upgrade their role
in the IMF. They are ready to discuss the strengthening of the Funds
resource base, in particular, for helping the EU to get out of the debt
crisis. At the same time, they demand redistribution of the Funds quotas,
which means both the realignment of world financial flows and the
rearrangement of votes when the IMF makes decisions.
At present, almost half of the votes belong to
the EU and the US, while BRICS member-states have about 10%. In 2010 BRICS
raised its quota a little but its potential is still underrated. The West
will keep trying to hamper the IMF reform, so as to prevent countries with
growing markets from strengthening their positions.
Meanwhile, the need for replenishing the IMF
resource base will apparently make the management of the Fund respond to the
BRICS initiative.
