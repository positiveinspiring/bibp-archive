Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been working closely with hotels on many levels as
private partners in the war on terror, as part of the expanding If You See
Something, Say Something program (below video):
Manuals such as the 84-page,
Protective Measures Guide for the U.S. Lodging
Industry have been sent out to
teach owners and staff how to properly spot potential terrorists.
Typical
suspicious behavior includes paying with cash and "insisting on privacy"
among a plethora of other dangers.
As if it wasn't bad enough that hotel guests are secretly being assessed by
untrained intelligence assets of Homeland Security, now guests are to be
subjected to psy-op recruitment techniques via their TV sets in major hotels
such as "Marriott, Hilton, Sheraton,
Holiday Inn and other hotels in the
USA," according to an
article published in the travel section of USA TODAY:
It is only a 15-second public service announcement, but follows
similar PSA programming that aims to create
fearful masses willing to call authorities over the flimsiest of suspicious
activities:
This message will be included with many others in the constant
rotation for hotel guests to become further acclimated to being part of the
snitch culture.
Citizen spies are a cornerstone of all totalitarian regimes.
Now, it seems that with the addition of 5,400 hotels to the Homeland
Security takeover of hearts and minds, it is impossible to deny that
modern-day America has become another shining example of imperial ambitions
turning upon itself.
