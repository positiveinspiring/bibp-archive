When government officials came to Silicon Valley
to demand easier ways for the worlds largest Internet companies to turn
over user data as part of a secret surveillance program, the companies
bristled. In the end, though, many cooperated at least a bit.
Twitter declined to make it easier for the government. But other companies
were more compliant, according to people briefed on the negotiations.
They opened discussions with national security
officials about developing technical methods to more efficiently and
securely share the personal data of foreign users in response to lawful
government requests. And in some cases, they changed their computer systems
to do so.
The negotiations shed a light on how Internet companies, increasingly at the
center of peoples personal lives, interact with the spy agencies that look
to their vast trove of information - e-mails, videos, online chats, photos
and search queries - for intelligence.
They illustrate how intricately the
government and tech companies work together, and the depth of their
behind-the-scenes transactions.
The companies that negotiated with the government include,
...according to one of the people briefed on the
discussions.
The companies were legally required to share the
data under the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. People briefed on the
discussions spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are prohibited
by law from discussing the content of FISA requests or even acknowledging
their existence.
In at least two cases, at Google and Facebook, one of the plans discussed
was to build separate, secure portals, like a digital version of the secure
physical rooms that have long existed for classified information, in some
instances on company servers.
Through these online rooms, the government would
request data, companies would deposit it and the government would retrieve
it, people briefed on the discussions said.
The negotiations have continued in recent months, as Martin E. Dempsey,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, traveled to Silicon Valley to meet
with executives including those at Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Intel.
Though the official purpose of those meetings
was to discuss the future of the Internet, the conversations also touched on
how the companies would collaborate with the government in its
intelligence-gathering efforts, said a person who attended.
While handing over data in response to a legitimate FISA request is a legal
requirement, making it easier for the government to get the information is
not, which is why Twitter could decline to do so.
Details on the discussions help explain the disparity between initial
descriptions of the government program and the companies responses.
Each of the nine companies said it had no knowledge of a government program
providing officials with access to its servers, and drew a bright line
between giving the government wholesale access to its servers to collect
user data and giving them specific data in response to individual court
orders.
Each said it did not provide the government with
full, indiscriminate access to its servers.
The companies said they do, however, comply with individual court orders,
including under FISA. The negotiations, and the technical systems for
sharing data with the government, fit in that category because they involve
access to data under individual FISA requests.
And in some cases, the data is transmitted to
the government electronically, using a companys servers.
"The U.S. government does not have direct
access or a back door to the information stored in our data centers,"
Googles chief executive, Larry Page, and its chief legal officer, David
Drummond, said in a statement on Friday.
"We provide user data to governments only in
accordance with the law."
Statements from Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook,
Apple, AOL and Paltalk made the same distinction.
But instead of adding a back door to their servers, the companies were
essentially asked to erect a locked mailbox and give the government the key,
people briefed on the negotiations said. Facebook, for instance, built such
a system for requesting and sharing the information, they said.
The data shared in these ways, the people said, is shared after company
lawyers have reviewed the FISA request according to company practice. It is
not sent automatically or in bulk, and the government does not have full
access to company servers.
Instead, they said, it is a more secure and
efficient way to hand over the data.
FISA orders can range from inquiries about
specific people to a broad sweep for intelligence, like logs of certain
search terms, lawyers who work with the orders said. There were 1,856 such
requests last year, an increase of 6 percent from the year before.
In one recent instance,
the
National Security Agency (NSA) sent an agent to a tech companys headquarters
to monitor a suspect in a cyber-attack, a lawyer representing the company
said. The agent installed government-developed software on the companys
server and remained at the site for several weeks to download data to an
agency laptop.
In other instances, the lawyer said, the agency
seeks real-time transmission of data, which companies send digitally.
Twitter spokesmen did not respond to questions
about the government requests, but said in general of the companys
philosophy toward information requests:
Users, "have a right to fight invalid government
requests, and we stand with them in that fight."
Twitter,
Google and other companies have typically
fought aggressively against requests they believe reach too far.
Google,
Microsoft and
Twitter publish transparency reports detailing government requests for
information, but these reports do not include FISA requests because they are
not allowed to acknowledge them.
Yet since tech companies cooperation with the
government was revealed Thursday, tech executives have been performing a
familiar dance, expressing outrage at the extent of the governments power
to access personal data and calling for more transparency, while at the same
time heaping praise upon the president as he visited Silicon Valley.
Even as the White House scrambled to defend its
online surveillance, President Obama was mingling with donors at the Silicon
Valley home of Mike McCue, Flipboards chief, eating dinner at the opulent
home of Vinod Khosla, the venture capitalist, and cracking jokes about Mr.
Khoslas big, shaggy dogs.
On Friday, Mark Zuckerberg,
Facebooks chief executive,
posted on Facebook a call for more
government transparency.
