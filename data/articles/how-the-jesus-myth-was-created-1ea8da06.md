How the Jesus Myth was created
How Christianity
was started
This Awareness wishes to remind you
that the story of Jesus, the first written word, was that which was put down
some 80 years after his existence on this plane; that It wishes also
to inform you that the composite known as the entity Jesus was that which
was put together from a variety of information.
This Awareness indicates that essentially,
under Constantine, the concept of the Catholic or Universal, (Catholic meaning
Universal) religion, the official Roman religion, as that which was a composite
of various religious writings which were brought together to form that which
is known as the Christian religion. That many of the writings were assembled
from various sources, and brought into, and comprised those books of the Bible.
The Evolution
of the Bible
This Awareness suggest, there is
a book by Loyd Graham titled
Deceptions and Myths in the Bible; that
this book goes into the origin of the stories that have been related in the
Old Testament, especially in the Old Testament, which were literally taken,
in many cases word for word, or concept for concept from earlier writings.
For example, the story of Noah and his four sons having been taken from writings
which long predated the stories in the Old Testament and which used terms
and names for the sons which were identical to those reported in the Old testament.
This Awareness indicates that the
story of Moses as having been stolen from a Syrian myth that had come down
in relation to an entity names Misis. This Awareness indicates that a great
number of the stories within the Old Testament were simply the result of the
Hebrew priests attempting to create a set of myths and stories by which they
could organize their own religion, their own philosophy, in order to form
a more cohesive society in those days. This Awareness indicates that the works
of Loyd Graham go deeply into finding these earlier stories from Babylon,
which was the source of the story of the garden of Eden, through Syrian and
other cultures and Indian records and stories of India.
This Awareness indicates that even
the New Testament is assembled from patterns related to stories taken from
earlier sources, such as Zoroastrian, Mithrain, Krishna, Buddhism, and Egyptian,
and others, in which many verses are literally paraphrasing earlier writings,
and many of the stories attributed to the story of Jesus, were lifted directly
out of these other writings. The story of Jesus at the well, as one which
was taken from earlier writings. This Awareness indicates that it is of importance
that entities realize the origins of the Bible did not come from the pen of
God, but came from the earlier writings in different cultures and nations
at the time these Hebrew priests put this work together. This Awareness indicates
that these countries who were plagiarized then became labeled as heathen, -
nations whose philosophies were heathenistic, but this was only after their
stories had been stolen.
How symbols
influence entities
This Awareness indicates that
throughout most of this (past) 2000 year period of the Piscean Age, entities
have become more inclined toward open and shallow interpretation of stories
at face value, rather than looking more deeply at hidden meanings. It has
been the advent of psychology to bring back the significance of symbolism,
for in Freud's concern for the dream state, it emphasized the significance
of symbols and as symbols began to become more significant, entities began
to recognize symbolism in other levels that had previously been ignored or
forgotten.
This Awareness indicates however,
in the past most of the emphasis in secret schools was on symbolism rather
than on rational messages. This Awareness indicates that the rituals that
have been come down in churches, especially
the Catholic church are actually
symbolism; the bowing of the knee on the altar, and the various rituals that
take place have certain symbolic meaning and this symbolism is that which
the subconscious understand better than the rational mind. This Awareness
indicates that if entities cannot and do not receive training or teaching
in the significance and meaning of symbols, they become victims of those who
understand the power and control available through the manipulation of symbols.
How
the Jesus Myth was created
First of all, you have to realize
that Jesus was a composite of different entities and the name was chosen several
hundred years later at the Council of Nicea, wherein the entity Constantine
ordered the various religious sects to come together and create a single religion
for Rome, a Universal religion that incorporated all of the aspects of the
various religions, so that all could accept and subscribe to it.
The
Influence of Apollonius of Tyana
This entity Apollonius of Tyana is
the central figure of a certain religious order that was prevalent at that
time in Rome and his life was incorporated into the Holy Roman religion or
Catholic version of the Christian epic which became the official Roman religion
in approximately 300 AD.
This Awareness indicates that this
energy of Apollonius was incorporated, there was also energies of several
other spiritual leaders of Roman religious sects whose stories were also brought
in and there were those spiritual personalities or deities from other Roman
religious orders whose histories or religious myths came from other cultures.
Krishna for example, of India, was
one of the religious cults and groups in Rome, and his story was merged with
that of Apollonius of Tyana. The story of Krishna as that entity who came
into the earth born of a virgin and who attempted to save people from error
and sin, but who was hanged for his efforts.
This Awareness indicates that this
was incorporated in the story of Jesus and the Apollonius story was also part
of this story, and there were also entities whose religion was that of sun
worshipping, wherein there was the sun and the 12 houses or signs, and these
sun worshippers had their story of Jesus in which the sun god had 12 disciples
and these 12 disciples of course reflected the 12 signs of those who were
the sun worshippers in Rome. This was of course an astrological religion.

The
composite known as Jesus
This Awareness indicates that the
combination of the many different Roman religious orders or organizations,
the different religious sects, forming a composite in which the central heroic
character was the Son of God, having 12 disciples, being born of a virgin,
whose intent and purpose was to help save mankind, and for his efforts, the
entity was slain and put upon a cross; the entity also having certain miraculous
powers, including that of those who can heal by touch, or raise from the dead
or move into states of suspended animation, such as some of the masters of
India have demonstrated in various times throughout history.
Catholic
Church Tried to Destroy Jesus and His Family
Thus, one aspect of this composite
known as Jesus moved west to India, and into Kashmir, and was recorded as
having been the entity known as Jesus, and lived there to a ripe age. Another
aspect of this composite moved eastward along with the Holy Family, and bore
a child through Mary Magdalene. This Awareness indicates this was known as
the Holy Family, which the Catholic Church made every effort to eradicate
and destroy and remove any trace of the information surrounding that entity,
but which the Templars made every effort to preserve and to promote and carry
on that Holy Bloodline, even to the point of some hundred years later, taking
the Holy Family, the descendants of the Holy Family into the New World, through
Newfoundland and into what was later to be called the United States.
This Awareness indicates that in
this sense, the entity that contributed to the composite known as Jesus went
westward, while another entity who contributed to the composite known as Jesus
went eastward. This Awareness indicates there were of course, still others.
This Awareness indicates that in attempting to discuss the story of Jesus
in a traditional way opens a Pandora's Box of discrepancies, when you approach
or seek the truth of the matter, because the Jesus of the Bible, being a composite
of many different entities, or several different entities, is not the
true story.
