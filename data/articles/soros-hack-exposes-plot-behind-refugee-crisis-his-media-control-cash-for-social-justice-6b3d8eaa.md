for "Social Justice"

Leaked files from billionaire globalist George Soros' Open Society Foundation (OSF) two days ago have exposed several startling machinations about the organization - including flagrant schemes to manipulate the media, influence international immigration policy, and cash designated for social justice initiatives.
Soros has been ousted previously for pulling political strings in Ukraine, but as one memo revealed in the massive DCLeaks cache shows, the globalist also sought direct manipulation of Western media to align with that political agenda.
Titled the "Ukraine Media Project," the memo's authors admit that,
"this isn't proper independent journalism and we may damage our credibility with journalists," but that "journalists may produce stories that have no relevance for the narrative we seek to inform or stories that are counterproductive (enforcing narratives of fascism, etc.)"
In other words, Soros and his OSF (Open Society Foundation) acknowledged their designs in Ukraine could be conflated with fascism and thus, as they wrote, sought to alleviate potential backlash or opposition by offering,
"[s]elect journalists from 5 target countries (Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Greece) and offer them long stay reporting trips in Ukraine."
Once finagled into the trip, the memo's authors decided, rather than dictating content directly, they would,
"retain a veto on stories we think are counterproductive."
Tellingly listed under the memo's "Pros" section is the fact the scheme is a,
"Similar approach to what we have done for other press trips" and that the Ukraine trip would provide an "Opportunity to build relationships with journalists and news outlets."
Judging by the degree of influence Soros sought, those relationships wouldn't amount to just a drink after a hard day's work.
In fact, under the "Cons" portion, the authors lament specifically the potential for the trip to "enforce the narrative of GS/OSF manipulation" - because that's exactly what it would be?
Another portion of the Soros leaks concerns Europe's immigration crisis - which OSF argues should just be accepted as the "new normal."
On May 12, OSF program officer Anna Crowley and program specialist Katin Rosin co-wrote a memo titled "Migration Governance and Enforcement Portfolio Review," focusing on the OSF's International Migration Initiative created to influence world immigration policy, as the Daily Caller first reported.
The outlet reports:
"The nine-page review makes three key points: OSF - which doles out millions to left-wing causes - has been successful at influencing global immigration policy Europe's refugee crisis presents 'new opportunities' for the organization to influence global immigration policy the refugee crisis is the 'new normal'."
"The nine-page review makes three key points:

OSF - which doles out millions to left-wing causes - has been successful at influencing global immigration policy
Europe's refugee crisis presents 'new opportunities' for the organization to influence global immigration policy
the refugee crisis is the 'new normal'."
Crowley and Rosin write that the review seeks to "consider the effectiveness of the approaches we have used to achieve change at the international level."
Anyone unaware how far Soros' fingers stretch into global policy-making should consider the section of the review highlighted by the Daily Caller, titled "Our Work" - which describes how OSF has worked with "leaders in the field" to,
"shape migration policymaking and influence regional and global processes affecting the way global migration is governed and enforced."
The authors continue:
"Our premise for engaging in work related to governance was that, in addition to mitigating the negative effects of enforcement, we should also be supporting actors in the field proactively seeking to change the policies, rules, and regulations that govern migration. "We also believe that advances at the regional or national levels could create impetus for policy change or implementation of existing norms at the national level. We deliberately avoided the term 'global governance' because there is no single system at the global level for managing migration."

"We also believe that advances at the regional or national levels could create impetus for policy change or implementation of existing norms at the national level.

Further, IMI,
"has had to be selective and opportunistic, particularly at the global level, in supporting leaders in the field to push thinking on migration and better coordinate advocacy and reform efforts. We have supported initiatives, organizations, and networks whose work ties directly to our aims in the corridors."

Zero Hedge reported on a third aspect of the leak in a memo concerning the United States, indicating potential funding of the Black Lives Matter movement by Soros - though the connection appears hazy at best.
Providing $196,000 in funding for the Baltimore Education Research Consortium - a joint project of the city's public schools and Johns Hopkins and Morgan State Universities - one memo states:
"To support the American Journalism Review's series of articles on the crisis in American journalism with a focus on, among other things, coverage of federal agencies and state governments, including Maryland /$200,000/Strategic Opportunities Fund/2009."
A second part of that memo states:
"Throughout its 15-year history, U.S. Programs has complemented its national work with state and local grant-making. The Emma Lazarus Fund, the Southern Initiative, the Program on Reproductive Health and Rights, and the Youth Initiative all had a strong presence in states like Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas, New York, and California. In this way, U.S. Programs has not only advanced core priority issues at the national level, but it has also worked to enable local and state actors to play a more critical role in shaping discussions around criminal justice, drug policy, immigrants' rights, government security, and other key issues at the state level."

Obviously, given the enormous size of the document cache published by DCLeaks, an untold number of other Soros manipulations will likely be revealed in the weeks to come.
Soros Hack
- Top 10 Machinations of a Master Manipulator - by Makia Freeman August 23, 2016
from Freedom-Articles Website
The Soros hack has revealed
the vast and stunning influence of
NWO master manipulator George Soros.
So just what do these emails reveal about Soros?
He has an incredible array of Open Society Foundations (OSFs) in numerous countries across the world, all of which are pushing his particular agendas, such as,
open borders unfettered migration welfare and support for illegal migrants "social justice" (a loaded term which means many different things to different people) the "humanitarian" spreading of U.S. "democracy" around the world (more loaded terms and doublespeak)
open borders
unfettered migration
welfare and support for illegal migrants
"social justice" (a loaded term which means many different things to different people)
the "humanitarian" spreading of U.S. "democracy" around the world (more loaded terms and doublespeak)
The leaked documents include proof that Soros has been involved in all of the below top 10 machinations. Soros is actively intervening and interfering on a colossal scale.
He is causing problems and chaos (including murder and war) to reshape the world in his view (ordo ab chao):
1. Trying to sway a U.S. Supreme Court decision to get documentation and welfare for undocumented or illegal immigrant parents of a child U.S. citizen "Grantees are seeking to influence the Justices (primarily via a sophisticated amicus briefs and media strategy) in hopes of securing a favorable ruling in U.S. vs. Texas, and using the case to redefine messaging and align the movement." 2. Trying to buy journalists to present a favorable Ukraine narrative "Select journalists from the 5 target countries (Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Greece) and offer them long stay reporting trips in Ukraine. Rather than specify what they should write about they should make suggestions for articles; we retain a veto on stories we think are counterproductive this isn't proper independent journalism and we may damage our credibility with journalists. Journalists may produce stories that have no relevance for the narrative we seek to inform or stories that are counterproductive (enforcing narratives of fascism etc.)" (Remember that in June 2015, a small group of Ukrainian hackers exposed the communication between new president Petro Poroshenko - U.S. asset - and Soros, which showed that Soros was the puppet master assuring Poroshenko of U.S. help.) 3. Influencing and trying to take advantage of the European migrant crisis "Our premise for engaging in work related to governance was that, in addition to mitigating the negative effects of enforcement, we should also be supporting actors in the field proactively seeking to change the policies, rules, and regulations that govern migration. We also believed that advances at the regional or international levels could create impetus for policy change or implementation of existing norms at the national level. We deliberately avoided the term 'global governance' because there is no single system at the global level for managing migration." 4. Trying to reform immigration law throughout Europe and the world, including a U.S. immigration law passed by the "Gang of Eight" senators "The current refugee crisis is creating space to reconsider the governance of migration and the international refugee regime reforming migration governance at the global level." "Although [comprehensive immigration reform] was not achieved, winning the Senate with such a large, bipartisan majority was a partial victory and further than the movement had gotten in recent decades, and, as a result of the effort, the immigrant rights movement infrastructure matured and ultimately emerged stronger, more coordinated, and more cohesive." Document including a presentation from Ivy O. Suriyopas, a program officer with OSF's U.S. Programs 5. Funding BLM (Black Lives Matter) to the tune of $650.000, which had more to do with instigating violent anti-police riots than genuinely helping black people in poverty facing racism and discrimination "Recognizing the need for strategic assistance, the U.S. Programs Board approved $650,000 in Opportunities Fund support to invest in technical assistance and support for the groups at the core of the burgeoning #BlackLivesMatter movement." For more analysis on how the BLM movement is being coordinated at higher levels, along with the migrant crisis, see article Decoding Current Social Engineering Tactics of the Anglo-American-Zionist NWO Wikileaks added to the Soros hack by showing George Soros told Hillary (as Sec. of State) how to intervene in Albania. 6. Dictating to then U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton how to handle a political situation in Albania (as revealed by Wikileaks) "Dear Hillary, A serious situation has arisen in Albania which needs urgent attention at senior levels of the U.S. government. You may know that an opposition demonstration in Tirana on Friday resulted in the deaths of three people and the destruction of property. There are serious concerns about further unrest connected to a counter-demonstration to be organized by the governing party on Wednesday and a follow-up event by the opposition two days later to memorialize the victims " Soros went on to tell Hillary exactly who she needed to appoint as mediator: Carl Bildt Martti Ahtisaari Miroslav Lajcak Hillary did what she was told. 7. Donating money - buying influence - to "social justice" through centralization of power in the State "Build state-based power: Advance social justice in critical states through state-based issue advocacy and organizing where the opportunities to advance (or the threats to) open society are particularly significant." 8. Trying to make Greece support the Ukrainian Coup and turn against Russia "In general, and at your discretion, do not say you are doing this for Open Society because it is likely to close down doors. There's a lot of suspicion about Open Society in Greece, mainly because of its positions vis-à-vis the former Yugoslavia." 9. Gathering information on opponents to his agenda Daily Caller reports that Soros gave Center for American Progress (CAP) a $200,000 grant, then two more grants for a total of $500,000, for the purpose of researching and monitoring the activities of, opponents such as Pamela Geller (Stop Islamization of America) organizations such as Jihad Watch and the Middle East Forum Liz Cheney (daughter of former VP Dick Cheney) examining the role played by right-wing media, the Tea Party movement and others 10. Controlling the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine and other key Ukrainian figures Soros and his NGO executives conducted detailed and extensive meetings with just about every actor involved in the Maidan coup in Ukraine. These included, U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt David Meale (Economic Counsellor to the Ambassador) Lenny Benardo (OSF) Yevhen Bystrytsky (Executive Director, IRF) Oleksandr Sushko (Board Chair, IRF) Ivan Krastev (Chariman, Centre for Liberal Studies) Sabine Freizer (OSF) Deff Barton (Director, USAID, Ukraine) I wonder where Vicky "Fuck the EU" Nuland is in all of this, but I'm sure she'll be in there somewhere. In this excerpt below, Soros and Pyatt are on the same team in terms of propaganda dissemination after the illegal U.S. coup: "Ambassador: The short term issue that needs to be addressed will be the problem in getting the message out from the government through professional PR tools, especially given Putin's own professional smear campaigns. GS: Agreement on the strategic communications issue - providing professional PR assistance to Ukrainian government would be very useful. Gave an overview of the Crisis Media Center set up by IRF and the need for Yatseniuk to do more interviews with them that address directly with journalists and the public the current criticisms of his decision making."
"Grantees are seeking to influence the Justices (primarily via a sophisticated amicus briefs and media strategy) in hopes of securing a favorable ruling in U.S. vs. Texas, and using the case to redefine messaging and align the movement."

Wikileaks added to the Soros hack
by showing George Soros told Hillary (as Sec. of State)
how to intervene in Albania.

It is no wonder that nations now view NGOs very suspiciously.
No doubt, there are many good NGOs doing important work for the benefit of humanity, but on the darker side, NWO manipulators like Soros have seized upon them as a vehicle of infiltration and subversion, as a way to covertly influence, control and dominate a country without needing to overtly go to war with it.
Today's battles are being fought with NGOs and electronics, rather than armaments and nukes. We are in the middle of a giant propaganda war.
The Soros hack completely vindicates the prescient words of JFK, who made a famous speech where he mentioned that:
" we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence - on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections "
For anyone familiar with key conspiracy documents, this approach of Soros and his minions also echoes what is found in Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars:
"Everything that is expected from an ordinary weapon is expected from a silent weapon by its creators, but only in its own manner of functioning: it shoots situations, instead of bullets propelled by data processing, instead of chemical reaction (explosion) originating from bits of data, instead of grains of gunpowder from a computer, instead of a gun operated by a computer programmer, instead of a marksman under the orders of a banking magnate, instead of a military general" "The public cannot comprehend this weapon, and therefore cannot believe that they are being attacked and subdued by a weapon." "When a silent weapon is applied gradually, the public adjusts/adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment on their lives until the pressure (psychological via economic) becomes too great and they crack up. Therefore, the silent weapon is a type of biological warfare. It attacks the vitality, options, and mobility of the individuals of a society by knowing, understanding, manipulating, and attacking their sources of natural and social energy, and their physical, mental, and emotional strengths and weaknesses."

Like so much conspiracy theory that turns out to be conspiracy fact, the Soros hack now proves the nefarious and heretofore hidden influence that rich NWO billionaires like George Soros have on world affairs, foreign and domestic, due to their practically unlimited funds.
If you want to change the world, $25 billion goes a long way and will buy you a lot of influence over government policy and law.
The Soros hack is yet more evidence that we do not live in a world where our leaders are elected; they are selected, and on top of that, they rarely represent the common people, because they are beholden to moneyed interests, to the point where they are emailed and told how to intervene and directed what to do.
The Soros hack is yet more proof that the real truth of who runs the world is to be found in conspiracy research, and thankfully, as more and more leaks and hacks surface, we are beginning to put the full picture together.
