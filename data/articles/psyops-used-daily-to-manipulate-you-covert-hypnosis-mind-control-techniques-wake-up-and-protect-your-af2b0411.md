The average American is oblivious to the fact that since Sigmund Freud's
groundbreaking discoveries about the human psyche, modern governments and
corporations have been engaged in heightened psychological warfare and
PSYOPs to take control of your mind and create the culture of sheeple we now
live in.
This has been quite a feat, given the rugged individualism that was the
hallmark of early America. But it is obviously working.
Americans are largely sheeple, cooperatively
allowing the mass media, government propaganda and corporate marketing
machines to determine what is right, true and fashionable.
The only defense is education. If you are not aware of the covert processes
used to infiltrate your subconscious mind, then you are much more likely to
fall prey to them.
Were you aware that US government operatives know how to use hypnosis to
induce trance, provoke an average person to commit murder, then forget that
it happened? This process has been documented as part of the government's
effort to create a real Jason Bourne-like operative.
Of course, experiments were secretly forced upon
healthy yet vulnerable citizens and mental hospital patients, but that is
another story.
The point is, covert manipulation techniques DO NOT work on everyone. On
whom do the methods fail?
On informed skeptics who are grounded in the
present!
Herein lies your
protection
If your mind is CLOSED to manipulation, then you are safe
How do you close your mind to manipulation and learn to be skeptical? You
need to become aware of the tactics being used against you. Once you
understand the magician's secret, the magic disappears.
Beware of these kinds of tactics:
False flags
False flags are staged events
where the perpetrator is concealed and another party blamed.
This is useful for governments to convince
their people to support war, give up freedoms, or to induce fear for any
purpose. It is also useful for general demoralizing.
Hitler used a false flag event to sway the German people to support an
invasion of Poland.
Shock and awe
This is the method of displaying
overwhelming force or impressive technology to intimidate or demoralize
an enemy.
On a large scale, the US invasion of Iraq
under
George W. Bush qualified. On a
small scale, an NFL football team or boxer may make a grand entrance to
the contest to show the opponent up.
When a government puts its power on display, it is saying "We cannot be
defeated." When a corporation shows its massive resources or
technological savvy, it says, "We are the best choice."
Displays of power or technology, however, are nothing more than that -
displays. Such displays are so often smoke and mirror routines
that are not backed by reality.
Hypnotic language
When people speak to you, do you
ever question just what they are saying specifically?
Consider the following statements:
We must defend ourselves against all
evil.
I want you to prosper.
We will always endeavor to do the right thing.
All of the above statements share the
following quality - they DO NOT MEAN ANYTHING, specifically.
Let's take the first example above and see how many holes we can poke in
it.
'We must defend ourselves against all evil.'
-
Who is "we"?
-
Must? What would happen if we didn't
defend ourselves in this case? Whose problem is and can anything
effectively be done?
-
How shall we defend ourselves? What
does this mean that we will do, specifically, and at what cost?
Who/What else will our defensive actions affect?
-
Defend ourselves against whom,
specifically? I don't know anyone named "Evil."
-
All evil? Every evil that has ever
existed?
We need to learn to think and question!
False accreditation
To sway people emotionally, fake
associations are made.
"Four out of five dentists surveyed...."
Who are these dentists? Do any of them come
forward? Never!
Government and corporate manipulators routinely create false surveys and
false accrediting bodies specifically for the purpose of endorsing their
propaganda.
This is how bacon and eggs became the national breakfast. It is
also
how fluoride got into our drinking
water.
Fear
Fear can be induced as a trance
state. Imagine being alone with a group of small children.
"Wait!" you whisper. "I hear someone
outside."
You look out the window and allow an
expression of horror to come over your face.
"Oh my gosh, there is a robber out there
who wants to come in!"
Imagine the fear that will grip those
children.
At that point, they will do anything you
tell them that they believe will them safe. They are in a trance of
fear. They do not fear the real robber. There is no real robber.
They fear the robber in their mind, based on
your covert hypnotic induction.
Using the above
tactics together for a complete operation to gain control of your mind
A combination of techniques are used that might look something like this:
-
Stage a horrifying
false flag operation, such as a
mass shooting or explosion of some sort.
-
This induces FEAR, which you play up
through the media.
-
When in a fear trance, use vague,
hypnotic language to manipulate people.
"We must take appropriate measures
to protect our population so that this never happens again."
(This sentence means NOTHING, specifically. The real meaning is
simply not conveyed.)
-
Use false accreditation to endorse
whatever new legislation or product you want to sell to your new,
scared group of sheeple.
Open your eyes and ears and discover how
these techniques and others are being used every single day to gain
control of your mind and behavior.
