Massacre

Anders Behring Breivik said he conspired with business and political
leaders in London years before he set about planning last weeks massacre,
an intriguing connection given the fact that the gunmans manifesto is
datelined London 2011," suggesting a clear connection to the capital as
evidence emerges of a wider plot.
In the manuscript Breivik describes his 'mentor' as an Englishman he
identifies as 'Richard', and says his journey into violent extremism began
at a small meeting in London in 2002 where a group of like-minded extremists
met to 'reform' the Knights Templar Europe, a military group whose purpose
was, 'to seize political and military control of western European countries
and implement a cultural conservative political agenda,' reports the
Guardian.
In his manifesto Breivik said the gathering in London was
'not a
stereotypical rightwing meeting full of underprivileged, racist skinheads
with a short temper'. Instead, he claimed those present were successful
entrepreneurs, 'business or political leaders, some with families, most
Christian conservatives, but also some agnostics and even atheists'.
The gunman said that the participants of the meeting came from all over
Europe and that he was first put into contact with them by a Serbian
crusader commander.
Breiviks connections with London - he lived there as a child when his
father was working at the Norwegian embassy - are clearly a cornerstone of
his plot.
Indeed, as Mark Steyn writes for the National Review Online, the
gunmans manifesto is largely concerned with Britain and America.
The
entire document is strangely anglocentric - in among the citations of NR and
The Washington Times, theres not a lot about Norway.
The manifesto, signed by the killer as Andrew Berwick (an
anglicized
version of his name), is datelined London, 2011, clearly indicating
Breivik was in the English capital before his rampage, although the media
have asserted otherwise without explaining why Breivik would deliberately
place such an error in his own screed.
It is now being reported that Breivik was in London as recently as last
year, when he took part in an English Defence League (EDL) march.
The EDL is a
far-right group that largely comprises of former football hooligans. Its
organization is shabby and the group has attracted an odious reputation of
being run by violent, drunk and racist thugs. The groups unpopularity is
habitually exploited by the British establishment to demonize legitimate
criticism of mass immigration policies as extremist and racist.
The group is routinely labeled neo-nazi by the
mainstream media yet is staunchly pro-Israel and has displayed Israeli flags
at its protests.
The EDL routinely clashes with pro-Muslim groups, scenes
that are given generous press coverage in order to push clash of
civilization rhetoric and keep the British people at each others throats,
enabling the government to engage in divide and conquer tactics by
manipulating the public perception of both groups.
Since the EDL is mostly made up of gangs of football hooligans, which have
been completely infiltrated by British authorities, many have speculated
that the English Defence League is being steered and controlled by MI5 and
Special Branch.
We now know that Norwegian intelligence was aware of Breivik and had
included his name on a terrorism watch-list back in March after the gunman
purchased large amounts of fertilizer from an online shop in Poland. This
wasnt a sprawling database with hundreds of thousands of names amongst
which Breiviks could have been lost, it contained just 60 individuals.
The list was passed to the Police Security Service (PST) by Norwegian
Customs, which might explain why police knew Breiviks name before they
arrested him on the island of Utoeya, even as the global media was all but
certain that the attacks were the work of Al-Qaeda Muslims.
Breiviks financial fortunes certainly took a turn for the better in 2006.
According to his tax filings, which are publicly available on the Internet
for all Norwegian citizens (Breiviks have since been deleted but
the cache
remains), the gunman went from making virtually nothing to an income of over
600,000 krona (roughly $116,000 dollars) from 2006-2007.
As more details emerge about Breiviks activities, his connections with
London and his assertion that he was merely one of at least three cells,
its obvious that a wider plot involving more people was responsible for
last weeks carnage. This dovetails with reports from eyewitnesses who said
they heard gunshots coming from two different parts of the island and saw
another gunman with dark hair.
Whether or not an incident that took place in
south west Norway on Saturday night, in which a man was shot in the head by
two men wearing military uniforms, is connected to the attacks remains to be
seen.
However, Norwegian authorities and the establishment media are actively
discouraging the possibility of a wider plot by focusing solely on Breivik
and largely disregarding ample evidence of others being involved, thereby
ensuring the business and political leaders the gunman said he conspired
with remain under the radar.
