Equipment Frequently Used by Trainers
It may help therapists to realize the equipment that trainers use.
If their client describes these items, which may appear quite sophisticated,
believe them. The cult has become quite technologically advanced.
Training room: the average training room is a neutral colored room,
with walls painted either a dull gray, white, or beige. Some may be
painted in various colors, as part of color coding. They are often located
in secret underground rooms, or basements of large private residences,
and will be entered from the main building through a covered doorway.
Impromptu training rooms may be set up during military exercises outdoors,
in covered canvas tents.
Trainers: the Illuminati have a rule: there must always be a minimum
of two trainers working with a person. This prevents a trainer from
being either too severe, or permissive, or developing too close a bond
with the subject; the watchful eye of the other trainer prevents this.
Younger trainers are paired with older, more experienced trainers. The
older trainer will teach the younger, who does most of the actual work.
If the younger is unable to finish a task, or loses heart, the older
one will step in.
Head trainers: will teach, they will also work with the council leaders
and hierarchy. All members are required to come in for a "tune
up" (reinforcing programming), even top leaders, from time to time.
EEG machine: will often have abbreviated hookups for quick use. Used
extensively with brain wave programming; also to verify that a certain
alter is out when called up. May be used to verify deep trance state
before initiating deep programming. Trainers are taught to read these
readouts.
Trainer's table: a large table, frequently steel covered with plastic,
or easily cleaned material. On the sides at intervals are restraints
for arms, legs, neck to prevent movement.
Trainer's chair: large chair with arm rests. Will have restraints as
above at intervals to restrain movement while person sits in chair.
Shock equipment: models and types are quite varied, depending on age
and company. Most have a set of rubber covered wires, with electrodes
that may be connected with Velcro, rubber (steel tips imbedded under
finger and toe nail beds), or gel pads (larger body areas such as chest,
arms, legs). Some are tiny electrodes, which can be taped next to eyes,
or placed within genitalia. These are connected to the "shock box",
which has controls that can determine amount of electricity , and frequency,
if interval shocks are desired.
Drugs: any number of opiates, barbiturates, hypnotics, sedatives, anesthetic
agents. Resuscitative drugs, antidotes are also kept, clearly labeled
and indexed. Many drugs, especially experimental ones, are only known
by code names, such as "alphin 1".
CPR equipment: in case person has adverse reaction to drugs or programming.
At times, a child alter will come out inadvertently during a programming
sequence, and will be overdosed with the drugs meant for adult alters.
The trainers must give it the antidote, and resuscitate it, just as
if a real child is out. They are well aware of this fact, and will severely
punish child alters, to teach them to come out only when called out.
Virtually reality headsets: the keystone in recent years. Many programming
sequences utilize holographic images, and virtual reality set ups, including
assassination programs, where the person realistically "kills"
another human
being. These virtual disks are far more advanced than those in video
arcades.
Body building equipment: used in military training to increase fitness,
lean body mass.
Steel instruments: used to insert into orifices, cause pain
Stretch machine: used as punishment, "stretches " person
without breaking bones. Extremely painful.
Trainer's grids and projectors: used to project grids on wall or ceiling.
Movie projector: to show movies, although new VR disks are replacing
these computer: collect and analyze data; keep computer grid on person's
system. Current military computer access codes will be used to download
into governmental computers.
trainer's journals: contain indexed copies of subject's systems, including
key alters, command codes, etc.
Comfort objects: used to comfort subject afterwards. May be toy or
candy for child alters, or oils for massage. Warm towels, or beverages
may be given, as the trainer "bonds with" and comforts person
they worked with. This is probably the most important part of the training
process, as the trainer explains calmly, kindly how well the person
did, how proud they are of them.
