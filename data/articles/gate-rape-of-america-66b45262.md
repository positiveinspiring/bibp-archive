At the same time that the
federal government is mandating the physical and
constitutional violation of air travelers at our airports,
they are prohibiting law enforcement officers in Arizona
from asking for proof of identity and citizenship
from those they suspect as being
illegal aliens
They
could not have planned it any better, initiating enhanced screening
procedures right before the busiest travel time of the year.
Our visceral reaction, outrage and chants of
dont touch my junk are understandable and warranted, but tend to
overshadow our visibility of whats really taking place, which is vastly
more than meets the eye.
The media seems to be stuck on reporting the more salacious aspect of
TSA agents having a collective case of the touchy-feelies
while the underlying motives of our government are barely addressed.
Yet thats exactly where we need to be looking.
We need to identify and understand what is
taking place behind the snappy sound bites and outrageous video snippets. We
also need to understand why these things are happening so we will not be
surprised at what is likely to happen next.
As I wrote
last week, the current TSA measures have
very little to do with security.
It is becoming much more apparent that the
Department of Homeland Security itself, at its uppermost levels, has little
to do with actual security. At the same time that the federal government is
mandating the physical and constitutional violation of air travelers at our
airports, they are prohibiting law enforcement officers in Arizona from
asking for proof of identity and citizenship from those they suspect as
being illegal aliens.
They are also
planning to remove the token presence of
National Guard troops from our southern border by the end of February. So
much for security.
This entire scenario would be difficult to reconcile in logical terms, or to
simply laugh off and blame it on the inefficiency of government,
until you probe deeper into their agenda.
The American people are being carefully and deliberately conditioned to
accept the stripping away of our Constitutional rights, a process in the
making for nearly a century.
To see how far this conditioning has progressed,
just look at how many people are willing to be groped, fondled, nuked, and
subjected to other forms of degrading tactics by agents of the
federal government for the mere illusion of security. They reason that if it
will make air travel safer to have their genitalia fondled, that it is a
necessary evil.
Well, they are only half correct; it is indeed
evil, but not necessary.
At what point,
I believe that is the larger question being
raised by the puppeteers behind the proverbial curtain.
The erosion of our rights has been in progress for decades and under
multiple administrations, but with this administration in particular, there
is more to it. Rather than ending this madness, the Obama administration has
instead ramped up the very tactics that had progressives calling
George Bush a
criminal.
Why? It seems that people cannot understand that
under the umbrella of globalism, political party is irrelevant.
Both sides drink from the same trough.
To see it as some do, which is some sort of political payback against the
American people for the midterm elections results is, in my opinion,
purposely myopic. It is much larger than that.
The continuity of criminalizing non-criminal behavior of free citizens while
giving a pass to others transcends political parties and is an integral
component of social conditioning. Although it did not begin with
Obama,
he is integral in accelerating the implementation of the global
power elites goals and objectives. Like the sand in the top of an
hourglass appears to flow faster as it reaches its end, so too does the
agenda of the proponents of a new world order.
We are now at that point in time.
It would be a mistake to believe that this administration is merely
mishandling the current throw-down between the TSA and airline passengers at
the boarding gate. It is not being mishandled, but carefully crafted into
organized chaos designed to elicit social unrest.
Anyone refusing to comply with the increasingly
oppressive federal rules will be considered domestic terrorists, much
like weve seen with individuals and groups concerned with our Constitution,
second amendment rights, and pro-life causes.
Many wonder how a
regime in Germany could have rounded up and
sent
six million Jews to their deaths. Well,
this is exactly how. It begins through conditioning, involves
nationalization, and relies heavily on the conditioning and on the malaise
of the people.
They are the power elite - the globalists, who
do not view themselves as Americans and dont care about national
sovereignty and care less about state sovereignty.
Under previous administrations, weve seen the likes of
Henry
Kissinger,
Zbigniew Brzezinski and countless others who were appointed
to cabinet positions or advisors with designs on a one world government and
consolidation of power among
the
global elite.
Now, take a good look at who Barack Obama has
chosen as
czars, advisors and appointees. Look at
what has been advanced within the last two years under Obama.
In addition to the social component, there is a large economic component to
this madness as well.
Under Obama, the nations health care industry has essentially been
nationalized, and facing financial difficulties, the government became
heavily involved in the auto industry to the point of de-facto
nationalization.
Why not the air travel industry, which in 2007,
was responsible for generating just over $1.3 trillion in economic activity,
or 5.6% of the total U.S. economy. The airline industry employed over 11
million Americans who earned about $396 billion.
The enhanced screening at our airports is not helping the airline
industry, a vital part of our economy and infrastructure, but hurting it.
This nonsense has the capacity to deliver a death blow to the airline
industry.
Could this be part of the larger agenda?
Just look at the history over the last two years, and I believe the answer
will become quite evident.
Meanwhile, take a look back at the airports across the country, as tens of
thousands will be huddled in confined areas just to board a plane for the
Thanksgiving holiday. It is a recipe for disaster.
But a planned one that should not surprise
anyone who is paying attention.
