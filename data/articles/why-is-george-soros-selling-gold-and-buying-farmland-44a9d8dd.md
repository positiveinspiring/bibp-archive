Food prices are skyrocketing all across the
globe, and there's no end in sight.
The
United Nations says food inflation is currently at 30% a year,
and the fast-eroding value of the dollar is causing food prices to appear
even higher (in contrast to a weakening currency). As the dollar drops in
value due to runaway money printing at
the
Federal Reserve, the cost to import foods from other nations
looks to double in just the next two years - and possibly every two years
thereafter.
That's probably why investors around the globe are flocking to farmland as
the new growth industry.
"Investors are pouring into farmland in the
U.S. and parts of Europe, Latin America and Africa as global food prices
soar,"
reports Bloomberg magazine.
"A fund controlled by
George Soros, the billionaire
hedge-fund manager, owns 23.4 percent of South American farmland venture
Adecoagro SA."
Jim Rogers is also quoted in the same
story, saying,
"I have frequently told people that one of
the best investments in the world will be farmland."
That's because demand for food is accelerating
even as,
Ceres Partners, which invests in farmland, has
produced astonishing 16 percent annual returns since its launch in 2008. And
this is during a depressed economy when most other industries are showing
losses.
Why growing and
storing your own food can be a goldmine
All this means we can count on three things
happening in the years ahead:
-
Prediction #1) Food supplies will become
more scarce
-
Prediction #2) Food prices will double
over the next 2-3 years, and then probably double again in another
2-3 years
-
Prediction #3) When food prices are 400%
of today's levels, backyard farming or gardening pays off big in
terms of real dollar savings
In other words, as food prices skyrocket, it
becomes increasingly more financially viable to grow your own food (or store
it now while prices are low).
I'm listing some resources below where you can
learn more about growing your own food or storing high-density superfoods
right now, but in the mean time, I'd like you to start considering the idea
of starting your own garden in the spring.
You can't grow gold. You can't print your own currency (unless you're the
Fed).
But you CAN grow something more valuable than
gold and money: Food!
Lessons from post
World War II Taiwan and why food is more valuable than gold
I lived in Taiwan for two years, and I've had the opportunity to talk with
people there who lived through the post World War II recovery.
During the war, of course, Taiwan was occupied
by the imperialist Japanese empire, and Taiwan existed in a state of
military occupation (with perpetual martial law).
After the war ended and the Japanese left, Taiwan bootstrapped its own
government into power under Chiang Kai-shek. The old Taiwan currency was
immediately printed in large quantities by the Taiwan government leading to
a runaway inflation scenario for what is now called the "old Taiwan dollar."
Very quickly, however, the government launched a
new currency called the New Taiwan dollar (NT$). By 1949, the old Taiwan
dollar was being exchanged for the New Taiwan dollar (NT$) at a ratio of
40,000 to 1. (Yep. You had $40,000 and now it's worth a buck...).
During those years after WWII, if you wanted to rent an apartment, buy a
house or find a place to live, cash was worthless and even GOLD wasn't
considered very useful. The only thing that represented real wealth was
FOOD. If you had food, you could trade it for anything: an automobile, a
home, tools, clothing or even land. If you didn't have food, you were
bankrupt; regardless of how much cash or gold you had.
A chicken that could lay eggs was worth more than an ounce of gold!
You can't eat gold, folks. And you can't eat silver. Everybody has to eat to
stay alive, and that means everybody needs a constant stream of food just to
keep breathing.
That's why investing in food makes so much
sense.
And by "investing in food," I mean any or all of the following:
-
Investing in storable food that you can
save on the shelf and keep for future use or barter.
-
Investing in your own gardening skills
so that you have the know-how to produce food when needed.
-
Investing in non-hybrid garden seeds so
that you have the genetic blueprints to grow food that can propagate
itself generation after generation.
-
Investing in farmland - especially
farmland with water - that offers the fertility and climate to
produce food.
-
Investing in educational courses that
teach you how to create food through a variety of methods:
Wildcrafting, gardening, sprouting and so on.

Food skills are about
to become essential for survival
No matter what you do, remember to stay informed about growing your own
food. It's something that's hugely rewarding right now and about to become
hugely profitable in the years ahead as food prices continues to skyrocket.
Remember, folks: You can't eat gold. So make sure food storage and
production becomes part of your overall preparedness strategy, too. Yes,
gold and silver are extremely useful and I recommend them, too... but don't
forget to feed yourself.
You can starve to death in a house built out of
solid gold if you forget to cover food production!
