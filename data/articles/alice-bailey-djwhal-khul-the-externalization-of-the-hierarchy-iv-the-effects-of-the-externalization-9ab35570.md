The Effects of the ExternalizationSeptember
1949
In my previous instruction upon this theme I dealt with the various energies which
would be brought into activity or utilized when the Masters emerged from the silence in
which They have guarded Themselves for so many thousands of years. The point to be grasped
is that the energies with which I dealt will be used in a new and more vital manner. These
energies are ever present and ever active, but they swing into activity sequentially and
under law and order, and some are more prominent at one time than others; they act vitally
and energetically in the needed program which the plans of the Hierarchy may entail in
any particular cycle.
These energies bring about what we idly call the "events" of the day; they
condition our passing civilizations and are so much a part of the world in which we live
and move and have our being that events, as expressions of directed energies, mean little
to us, except in so far as they may affect adversely our personalities. They connote
simply a way of life in any specific time. These energies were started on their activities
in the very night of time; they established - each of them - their needed cyclic rhythm;
they are responsible for the activity of substance on matter or of the action of the vital
or etheric body upon matter; they are the lowest formulated expression of the creative
Intelligence, embodying the principle of life or livingness because they essentially are
life itself and life in action. Forget not that dense matter is not a principle; it is
only that which is responsive to the creative principle.
When, however, the externalization of the Hierarchy begins to take place (and it will
be spread over quite a long [674] period of time), the impact of these substantial
energies on matter will be radically altered because they will be - for the first time in
history - directed from etheric levels, from the etheric body of the planet in the three
worlds; hitherto, these energies have been directed from the buddhic plane which is the
lowest of the cosmic etheric levels. Fundamentally, direction will still be from the
buddhic plane, but the detailed and focused direction will be given from within the three
worlds and upon the physical plane; this will be the task of the externalized Ashrams,
organized to function openly.
It was the
knowledge that this important development was imminent which made the Hierarchy in the
last century widen the area or the scope of its teaching activity and thus bring to the
consciousness of modern man the knowledge of what occultism essentially means. The
keynotes upon which the occult philosophy is built are:
- There is naught in manifestation except organized energy
- Energy follows or conforms itself to thought
- The occultist works in energy and with energies.
The thought of God brought the universe of energies into organized form upon the
highest of the seven planes, or upon the first cosmic etheric level. These energies have
for untold aeons been directed from the fourth or lowest of the cosmic etheric planes, the
plane which we call the buddhic and regard as the first definitely spiritual plane, in our
usually erroneous thought; this direction has been under impression from Shamballa, and
the Masters have "manipulated these energies in conformity with the Plan, which is
the blueprint of the Purpose."
In the great Approach of the Hierarchy to humanity and its imminent appearance upon the
physical plane, the center of direction will also necessarily approach still nearer, and -
as a result of the future hierarchical manifestation - centers of energy direction will be
found wherever the ashram of a Master is located in any part of the world. This is a
statement [675] of profound significance; it is an indication of hierarchical policy and a
mode whereby modern science (working as it does with energies) can be brought into
cooperative association and relation with an ashram upon the physical plane knowing it for
what it is - an entirely new departure.
