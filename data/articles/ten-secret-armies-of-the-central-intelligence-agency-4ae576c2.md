# Ten Secret Armies of the Central Intelligence Agency

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_cia34.htm

-
Cuba:
Probably the best known secret army.
Castro nationalized the assets of
western companies after his government
took power, so the US decided to
overthrow the government of Cuba and
install a puppet regime. As with most of
the armies backed by the US intelligence
establishment, it failed.
Miserably...
The Bay of
Pigs invasion saw
1400 US-trained
Cubans surrender to Castro's
forces within 24 hours.
-
El
Salvador:
The
US-supported Salvadoran government faced
opposition from communist rebels.
US
intelligence saw an obvious and simple
answer: establish
death squads.
US intelligence trained and advised
pro-government forces as they massacred
villages and led the way to the
displacement of over a million people.
Immediately after the ceasefire, there
was a general amnesty for people
implicated in war crimes. This amnesty
was ruled to be illegal, but remains in
effect anyway.
Those seeking justice are
often burglarized and the
evidence of CIA
involvement is stolen.
-
Afghanistan:
The US armed and trained the Mujaheddin
fighters through
Operation Cyclone.
Later, many of these fighters would form
the core of the fundamentalist Islamic
terrorist groups we are fighting (or
possibly supporting) today. Yes, Osama
bin Laden was
one of the
fighters trained by the CIA
in Afghanistan.
The whole operation was
carried out to stop the Soviet invasion.
-
Guatemala:
This little CIA caper is the origin of
the term "Banana Republic."
The
democratically elected President of
Guatemala
decided to punish the United Fruit
Company for
decades
of consorting with the country's
dictators. He began to propose
legislation to end the US
multinational's monopoly on almost
everything in the country.
So what else
could the CIA do? The agency
overthrew
the legal government and triggered a
war
over bananas.
-
Congo:
In the
1960s, Belgium was ending its colonial
rule over Congo.
Rather than
allow
self-determination,
the CIA
staged
assassinations, armed rebel
forces, brought in European mercenaries,
and even backed them up with a secret
air force.
-
Nicaragua (the second time):
In
the 1980s, the leftist Sandinistas took
power. The CIA backed the
Contra
militia that opposed them.
The agency
funneled them arms,
ran cocaine
for them, and trained the organization
that become well known for child
soldiers, massacres at literacy centers,
and war crimes of just about every
imaginable kind.
-
Angola:
The
CIA
hired
French and South African mercenaries to
assist right-wing groups in their fight
against the Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola.
The group
was competing with several other
paramilitary organizations in a fight to
take over the country after the
Portuguese decolonized. The CIA's
mercenary army predictably lost.
-
Ukraine (the first time):
During the second World War, the Nazis
set up a partisan group in Ukraine to
harass and slow the advancing Soviet
forces. At the end of World War II, US
intelligence began
funding
and
assisting
the partisan group.
The Soviets wiped
the partisans out in 1952.
-
Venezuela:
In
2002, a group within Venezuela attempted
to oust the government. The US flatly
denied involvement.
Of course, there is
more than enough
evidence to tie
the Bush Administration to the plot.
There is even circumstantial evidence a
more recent
second attempt.
-
Ukraine (the second time):
The most recent revolution in Ukraine
may have started organically, however,
it was seized upon by US intelligence.
The revolution became just another
method of installing a
US puppet regime.
The US chose
to install literal
Nazis.
These facts are largely
ignored
by US media.
