In an article posted on January 3 of this year, it was predicted a rise in food prices resulting from freak weather events.
Here's what the article said:
By the end of 2012, I predict significant food supply disruptions in North America, brought about either by radical weather affecting crop yields or perhaps the invasion of disease indirectly caused by the over-use of pesticides or GMOs. The number of people in America struggling to feed themselves and their families will rise along with food prices... Expect to see food prices climb with alarming speed over the next two years. While food won't disappear, it will become significantly more expensive, causing more people to shift to subsidized foods (corn, sugar, etc.) which also happen to be some of the worst foods for your health.

Now there's news from Mexico that the fresh produce normally shipped to U.S. grocery stores has been largely destroyed by the freak cold weather snap that struck the continental United States over the past 10 days.
As a result, prices on cucumbers, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes and asparagus are set to double or triple starting right now. Even worse, it looks like the supply of many of these items will be completely wiped out. You won't be able to buy them, in other words, at any price! This is the fallout from the worst freeze event recorded in North America in 60 years. It has affected not just Northern Mexico, but also much of the U.S. Southwest.
It also raises the question:
Is the food supply further threatened by radical weather events?
A theory of what's happening
I'm not going to go into all the details here, but from what I've been reading and researching about a number of seemingly-unrelated events, some clues that might explain their commonality begin to emerge.
It all seems to lead to the theory that this is all being caused by the weakening of the Earth's magnetic field. The magnetic field is shifting, you see. It's in the process of flipping, as it has done many times throughout Earth's history.
As explained on Wikipedia :
"The Earth's magnetic north pole is drifting from northern Canada towards Siberia with a presently accelerating rate -- 10 km per year at the beginning of the 20th century, up to 40 km per year in 2003, and since then has only accelerated."
I recently wrote about how an airport in Tampa, Florida recently had to renumber its runways to account for the unexpectedly rapid shifts in the Earth's magnetic poles. That same story discusses the theory of how the weakening magnetosphere may have allowed high altitude sub-zero air carrying toxic space clouds called Noctilucent clouds to invade the lower atmosphere, causing the sudden death of birds that we've been seeing reported across the globe. (This theory, however, does not account for the unexplained deaths of fish.) The other side effect of this is the introduction of extremely cold temperatures from high altitude (or low orbit) space clouds that could be reaching into the lower atmosphere and spreading from the North Pole down through areas that would normally never see such low temperatures.
This may explain the "freak weather" that's killing the produce and driving food prices through the roof.
How Earth's magnetosphere impacts your dinner plate
Of course, it's all just a theory so far, but here's the theory in a nutshell: Weakening Earth's magnetic field (which is what happens during the magnetic pole shift transition) causes extreme cold to break into Earth's lower atmosphere, which causes freak cold weather events to spread far and wide, which causes the destruction of food crops. Theoretically, this could even lead to a rapid ice age taking over the planet, almost like something out of a Hollywood movie. Such a scenario would obviously be devastating to the human population across the planet as billions would starve from a lack of food.
(That would no doubt fulfill Bill Gates' mission of reducing the world population, eh? Who needs vaccines when you've got sub-zero space clouds?) The Earth's magnetosphere, you see, is a vital protective force field that protects life on Earth. Without the magnetosphere, we would not only be fried by cosmic radiation; Earth's atmosphere would also be slowly blown away by the solar wind, leaving Earth looking a whole lot like Mars. The magnetosphere is believed to be generated by the Earth's core.
As Wikipedia explains,
"The internal field of the Earth (its "main field") appears to be generated in the Earth's core by a dynamo process, associated with the circulation of liquid metal in the core, driven by internal heat sources."
We know from studying lava flows of basalt rock that the Earth's magnetic field has "flipped" many times in the past.
Interestingly, a scientific study published in the journal Nature (1994) and entitled "New evidence for extraordinarily rapid change of the geomagnetic field during a reversal" reveals that the Earth's magnetic field has, in the past, shifted by as much as six degrees in just 24 hours. At that pace, the magnetic poles would be completely reversed in just 30 days.
A magnetic flip isn't pretty
This NASA page shows an interesting picture of what happens during a "magnetic flip".
It explains:
"Magnetic lines of force near Earth's surface become twisted and tangled, and magnetic poles pop up in unaccustomed places. A south magnetic pole might emerge over Africa, for instance, or a north pole over Tahiti. Weird. But it's still a planetary magnetic field, and it still protects us from space radiation and solar storms."

This magnetic pole shift (or "magnetic flip") could allow extreme cold to abruptly enter the lower atmosphere, perhaps even reaching all the way down to the Earth's surface. The magnetic field isn't "clean" and "smooth," you see.
Here's an image of the current magnetic map of the planet (2007):
Notice how it has holes in it?
It's not completely smooth and uniform as you might expect. In fact, magnetic "holes" can easily appear and then disappear anywhere on the planet as the flows of metal in the Earth's core shift around.
These holes can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few decades, depending on what's happening in the planet's core. During short-lived magnetic turbulence, a particular region on the planet can "lose" its magnetic field (it's neither North nor South but neutral).
This results in a magnetic "gap" that creates a vulnerability.
The general consensus is that the greater danger here is exposure to cosmic radiation, but there is also the possibility that freezing cold space clouds may also be influenced by the magnetosphere (or the gaps therein). That may be some of what we just experienced over the last ten days, in fact:
A taste of things yet to come if the magnetic field continues to churn and drift.
Imagine a winter where even Mexico freezes, and many areas of Canada maintain temperatures of minus 50 Celsius... Again, this is just a theory of what could be happening. A hypothesis.
I don't have any scientific proof that the magnetic pole shift is causing these freak cold weather events. But it's clearly an area deserving exploration. Because if the cold weather events get worse over the next few years, we could be looking at serious disruptions in the food supply, the climate and Earth's ecosystems. This isn't being caused by 'global warming,' either. Unless you believe that global warming causes global cooling, of course. Instead, this is being caused by the movement of Earth's core.
Therein lies the bad news:
There's virtually nothing we can do about it.
If the Earth's core wants to shift, it's going to shift, regardless of what you or I want it to do. If that's what's happening, get out your garden seeds and your cold weather greenhouses. It might be a good time to subscribe to your local CSA and support their farming efforts, too. You'll need to grow more food to help compensate for the global food failures likely to be brought on by increasingly radical weather. Get ready for some crazy summer monsoons in the months ahead, too. I predict we're going to see some cataclysmic flooding in Southeast Asia, followed by deadly droughts somewhere else on the planet.
Radical weather has a way of reminding humankind that we're not so clever after all... and that we need the planet for our survival, but the planet can survive just fine without us around.
