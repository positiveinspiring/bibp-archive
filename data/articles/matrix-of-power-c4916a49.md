Part One
Overview
So you see, my dear Coningsby, that the world is
governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are
not behind the scenes.
Benjamin Disraeli,
first Prime Minister of England,
in his book Coningsby
At one time or another we've all questioned as to whether all that we see
and are experiencing in our world has some sort of a rational plan behind
it, because we understand now that both the Republican and Democratic
Parties in America are basically run by the same people.
The same money
finances both sides.
We now know through the work of many historians who
have spent their lives working on research, that both sides of world
conflicts have always been financed by the same people. And, as I've said
many times before, this seems to be the method to the "madness" going on in
the world. We know, of course, that we cannot depend on the truthfulness our
leaders. Our leaders are "misleaders." There is a science they are
following. They have their own agenda and it does not include you.
This agenda also does not include many of our politicians, who have
sometimes felt helpless and spoke out as a result.
In 1922, New York City
Mayor John F. Hylan said,
"The real menace of our republic is this invisible
government which, like a giant octopus, sprawls its slimy length over city,
state and nation. Like the octopus of real life, it operates under cover of
a self created screen.... At the head of this octopus are
the Rockefeller
Standard Oil interests and a small group of powerful banking houses
generally referred to as international bankers.
The little coterie of
powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government
for their own selfish purposes. They practically control both political
parties."
What I have said, however, is that they do control both parties,
among many other things in the world.
Conflicts require money and cooperation. World conflicts require world banks
and international monetary funds. Professional groups all have fraternal
orders. Doctors, attorneys, etc., have their own specific fraternal orders.
In the banking world, it is the same way. They have the same fraternal order
in banking and politics.
However, we are not supposed to know anything about
that, because that's not any of our business. That fraternal order in
politics and banking has been known for many years by those on the inside.
It has been referred to by different names, at different times, in different
countries.
The best overall name that we can confer on this fraternal order,
which is running our country, politics, and monetary system, is
Freemasonry.
Our country, like so many before us, and like so many after us, was in
fact founded by Freemasons. Freemasonry, in one form or another, has played a
role in almost every government that was founded in this world. It is
powerful in operation today throughout the world. However, we do want to
establish first that what we are not talking about is Blue Masonry, or the
Masonic Lodges in your hometown.
We are not talking about the Freemasons
that live across the street from you. We're talking about a worldwide
fraternal organization that is powerful enough, old enough, and wise enough
to operate behind all governments in the world, behind fraternal
institutions, and behind international monetary systems in the world.
And, yes, they are, in fact, connected.
For instance, the idea that our country was founded by so many Freemasons
and
Rosicrucians, among others, will be consistently revealed throughout this
book.
We ask ourselves,
"Why do we fold the American flag in a triangle?"
What does the pyramid or the triangle have to do with the American system of
government on our dollar bill?
The Freemasonic royal arch.
We must now recall that our Constitution was
signed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania is referred to as the
Keystone State. The reason why Pennsylvania is the Keystone State, is
because the Freemasons that founded this country were members of the
Scottish Rite. Keep following here, and you will see what becomes quite
evident surrounding the classification of "keystone."
In that Scottish Rite organization there is the Royal Arch Degree. And, of course, the Royal Arch, if you do not know, was
originally designated because of the sun coming over the horizon in the
morning, which made the royal arch. The Freemasonic Royal Arch Degree has
been continually, and ever busy, throughout the world with their Freemasonic
endeavors.
The United States, as I've written, founded its Constitution in
Philadelphia, with Pennsylvania becoming the "key stone" of a royal arch. To
this day, Pennsylvania is known as the keystone state.
There is much concerning this conceptual premise in this material that we
each need to look at.
A version of the royal arch -
the "gateway" arch in St. Louis, Missouri.
We might ask ourselves about the Red Cross.
The
International Red Cross is a Masonic organization. They always, in every
conflict are able to go behind enemy lines. Why is the Red Cross, the
International Red Cross, able to go behind enemy lines in wartime, in
conflict? There is a reason.
The International Red Cross, out of London,
connected with the American Red Cross, comes from the Red Cross of Saint
George, the cross on the British flag, the red cross -
that is also from a Masonic institution.
You might also want to ask yourself about the biological warfare going on
in the world today.
AIDS, coming from out of nowhere, coming into the
homosexual community.
-
Just what are homosexuals doing today, that they
didn't do six thousands years ago?
-
Why is it that all of a sudden, in the
1980's, we had AIDS?
-
Is there any connection between AIDS and Legionnaire's
Disease?
And,
Keep in mind, too, that what the government pays for it gets. If you are
paid to do something for the government, they will extract from you exactly
what they have paid for. When we understand that, then we must look at our
national universities and schools, the government financed institutions of
education, to then examine the kind of students, and the level of education
that's being turned out by these government financed schools.
Logic will
tell you that what is being turned out in these schools of higher education,
is not in accord with what the state and the fed-era! government wanted. If
they were not getting what they proposed, then they would change it. The
bottom line is, that the government is getting just exactly what they have
ordered.
They are getting just what they have paid for!
They do not want your children to be educated. They do not want you, or any
of us, to think too much. That is why our country and our world has become
so proliferated with entertainments, mass media, game shows, the distracting
drive of soap operas, the every night, insane nonsense of sit-com television
shows, amusement parks, drugs, alcohol, and every other kind of
entertainment.
It is perpetuated primarily to keep the human mind distracted
and entertained.
This constant distraction assures that you don't get in the
way of important people by doing too much thinking! You had better wake up
and understand that there are people guiding your life and you don't even
know it. And, we now understand that most all American citizens have
suspected that something like this is going on.
But we are all too busy
being frenzied with this entertainment and distractions, trying to stay
alive and live our lives, and, after all, what can one person do about it?
One person can do nothing.
But, a national well-informed society can do
much.
Why does Hollywood do motion pictures like Death wish and Dirty Harry,
always showing how regular citizens are misused, abused, tricked and
deceived by their government and, then, one lone guy has to stand up for
what's right, because the whole system is corrupt? Why do you think they
make movies like that? Is there a message in that?
I'll tell you why. It's
very simple.
First of all, these conspirators, these people, make the
movies, showing you what the problem is, then they make the movies to show
you what the solution is. They know that you are frustrated. They know that
the people of America are frustrated, because they know there is no law and
order. But, that's purposely created. We're not supposed to have law and
order, yet! We're supposed to have crime, and the immorality, and the drugs,
and the murder, and all the other things we're besieged by.
We're supposed
to have that. If the government did not want that, it would not be here to
the degree that we have it, believe me.
The American government is the most powerful government the world has ever
known. They had the ability to get a hold on Adolph Hitler a few decades
ago. He had a standing army. Plus the greatest navy, air force, military,
and secret underworld organizations operating throughout the world. But,
this government got a hold on Adolph Hitler, because it chose to, and it
wanted to.
And, if you do not pay your income taxes they will find you if
you go to the Amazon jungle. And, they will make an example of you. They
will find you and they will deal with you, and you know it. But, for some
reason they are unable to get a handle on the drugs, and the crime in the
streets, for some reason. There is a reason, and that is what we want to
talk about. There is a method to the "madness."
You might also want to ask yourself about something from the early
seventies.
While no one was looking, NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
changed its fatigue colors, from the dark greens, and the browns, the
fatigue colors, or the camouflaged colors, to light tan. Throughout the
Western world the colors would change for the military from dark greens to
light tan, like sand.
Why?
Because this government, along with its NATO
allies realized that there would be a war in an area where they would need
camouflage which would be light tan. So, quietly they changed that, they
changed the color, and you didn't know anything about it.
You want to ask, too,
-
Where did the Communist government and Adolph Hitler
get their money?
-
Who financed Stalin, who financed Lenin, Trotsky, who
financed the Communist revolution?
-
You might want to ask yourself, what part
did American Wall Street play, and the international bankers in New York, in
Switzerland, in London?
-
What part did they play in financing Hitler?
Like the Communist movement, and God knows what
else they are financing throughout the world.
The idea was that those who direct the
overall conspiracy could use the differences in those two so-called
ideologies [marxism/fascism/socialism v. democracy/capitalism] to enable
them [the Illuminati] to divide larger and larger portions of the human
race into opposing camps so that they could be armed and then
brainwashed into fighting and destroying each other.
-Myron Fagan
Why is it that drugs are brought into this
country daily and we are not able to do anything about it? Why are we unable
to do anything about the aliens pouring in across the border?
I am here to
tell you why. It is very simple. The government gets what it wants. There is
a method to the "madness," and we are going to explain that to you.
The last two weeks of July, of every year, a secret meeting is held in our
country in northern California, by the world's most powerful people.
Bankers, politicians, industrialists, entertainment luminaries, a huge
composite of puissant world figures. This group is directly linked with the
European ruling elites, and is commonly known as the Bohemian Society.
Our
now famous
Council of Foreign Relations, the government behind the American
government, is represented at
the Bohemian Grove, along with members of the
Bilderberger Group of Europe. A meeting is held, once a year there, to
decide on a worldwide scale a manipulative agenda concerning your future. A
shining example of true democracy carried on in the dark. Obviously, here,
your vote doesn't count.
Appropriately, the owl was chosen as a symbol for
this ilk, for it, too, is at home in the dark.
The name bohemian carries a
dictionary definition as,
"A community of persons who adopt manners and
mores, conspicuously different from those expected, or approved of by the
majority of society who disregard conventional standards of behavior."
No
wonder they want no input from you. More specifically, and even darker, but
equally as insidious is the American organization that our own former
President
George Bush belongs to, namely, the
Skull and Bones fraternal
group supported by students studying under the auspices of Yale University.
Rightly understood to be America's secretly designed establishment. The
Bohemian Society, Skull and Bones, CIA, DEA, Mafia, and the IRS are just
some of the groups that make up the true power behind the throne of America.
Like all other kingships, America's power elite hinges on family blood. Just
like the power structure of the Mafia.
If you don't believe me, that an "elite" runs
America, then listen to these prominent people:
Today the path of total dictatorship in the
United States can be laid by strictly legal means, unseen and unheard by
the Congress, the President, or the people. Outwardly we have a
Constitutional government. We have, operating within our government and
political system, another body representing another form of government a
bureaucratic elite.
Senator William Jennet, 1954
The case for government by elites is
irrefutable.
Senator William Fulbright, former chairman of the US
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated at a 1963 symposium entitled: The
Elite and the Electorate Is Government by the People Possible?
Once again, it hinges a lot on bloodlines. The lineages of the American
Presidents and their bloodlines could make an entire book of its own. Rest
assured, that they are connected to the European aristocracies of power.
Starting from Edward II, and the III, of England, twenty-eight out of our
forty-two presidents were connected by English blood. Including President
Bush and Vice President Quayle, who are also, in fact, related to each
other. Most of the fourteen not connected by blood, were connected by
fraternal orders used by the bloodlines, with only a few exceptions.
Notably, one instance being a critical disruption by the Kennedy's, who
purposefully sought to disrupt this dynasty of power in America.
Owing to
their vast financial backing and personal, intellectual charisma, plus much
behind the scenes political maneuvering by his father, Joe Kennedy, John
Fitzgerald Kennedy was inserted into the presidency. The idea being, to
disrupt the status quo by establishing a Kennedy Roman Catholic dynasty,
and, thereby, serving notice on the Freemasonic powers of this world of
their unwillingness to cooperate and play by the rules.
Justifying feeling
threatened, the established bloodlines of power in America removed the
Kennedy threat, twice! Official police records showed that the John Kennedy
assassination was closely preceded and followed by as many as one hundred
assassinations, all of which were closely connected with the Kennedy's
family rise to power.
In our discussion of secret societies, Freemasonry, and occult orders in
general, we want to talk about one that might be familiar to you, or,
perhaps, you have even heard about. It is called the Illuminati. We don't
intend to spend a lot of time on the Illuminati, but just enough to
familiarize you if you've never heard of the organization.
It was founded in 1776, in the South of Germany, by a man named
Adam Weishaupt. He formulated his plans in relation to the
House of Rothschild in
England, Germany, France, and Italy. The Rothschild banking dynasty, behind
the government's of Europe, hired Adam Weishaupt to formulate a strategy for
the world at that time to accomplish certain goals for those in power.
That
plan came to be known as the Illuminati plan. Please note that you can find
most of this material in any library, any encyclopedia under the word
Illuminati, which obviously comes from the word illumine, to be enlightened,
to be in the light.
There is a very important book which I would like to bring to your
attention, called
Fire in the Minds of Men.
It is written on the origins of
the revolutionary fate. Fire in the Minds of Men was written by James Billington and is a profoundly important book in understanding the
revolutionary radical movements of the world today, and how they were
created, who finances them and what they are really all about.
I would like
to share with you a couple of his ideas that deal with the occult origins of
the organizational arrangements on just how occult organizations throughout
the world, namely secret societies, are organized. In the book, on page 87, Billington states that the story of
secret societies can never be fully
restructured. It has been badly neglected, even avoided one suspects,
because the evidence that is available repeatedly leads us into territory
equally uncongenial to modern historians in the East and the West.
In what follows, I shall attempt to show that the modern revolutionary
tradition, as it came to be internationalized under Napoleon, during the
Restoration, grew out of occult Freemasonry. The early organizational
revolutionary ideas originated more from Pythagorean mysticism than from
practical experience.
Moreover, the real innovators were not so much the political activists, as
much as literary intellectuals on whom German romantic thought in general,
and the
Bavarian Illuminati, in particular, exerted great influence. Here, Billington was specifically talking about the organization of the Bavarian
Illuminati. You can't discuss the Illuminati without understanding
the
Jesuit order of the
Catholic Church, because Adam Weishaupt himself, the
founder of the Illuminati, was, in act, a Jesuit priest.
He was not just an
ordinary Jesuit priest, however. In Bavaria he continued to support
revolutionary radical thinking against the church, giving to the world what
has come to be known, as the revolutionary tradition.
May 1, 1776, was when Adam Weishaupt founded this order. This date is
important, of course, in the Soviet Union and other communist countries,
because May 1st, May Day, is considered to be the momentous date to all
communist revolutionaries, when Adam Weishaupt founded the Illuminati. This
you will find, as I said, in any encyclopedia.
The bait that was laid by
Adam Weishaupt for control of a vast number of people worldwide, which has
now become a very old and tired project. The project was called Democracy, a
people's democracy. Adam Weishaupt, like many others before him, understood
that Democracy has never worked, is not working now, and never will work.
Basically, because of the reason, while people could be and are the central
power of any government, the people do not hold the power of any government
in the final analysis.
And, that while on the surface Democracy seems to be
the best of all possible worlds, Democracy is a very perverted form of
government, because the people can be misled.
Democracy comes from the word demos, meaning mob a mob in the street is a
demos.
Demosocracy; ocracy meaning rule. Demos-ocracy, or democracy, means
mob rule. You might say that true democracy is like thirty-five whites
hanging one black. That's democracy. The rule of the mob.
Now, when we put
it into more Americanized political terms, it is the rule of the people. And,
while that may sound good in print, the founders of democracy in our modern
day form realized that the people could be manipulated into accepting
whatever they would want the people to accept.
Let's go on with the subject of the Illuminati and its symbols. You will
find the symbol of the secret society on the back of a one dollar bill.
On
the back of the one dollar bill on the left-hand side you will see the
pyramid with an all-seeing eye, the eye of Horus, the Egyptian God of Light,
the Egyptian God, God's son, and you will see beneath the pyramid seventeen
seventy-six, spelled out in Roman Numerals, plus the words, Annuit Coeptis,
and is translated as Annuit, our enterprise. Coeptis is translated to mean
"crowned with success," or "is crowned with success," therefore,
Annuit
Coeptis is "our enterprise, which is now a success."
Then in order to find
out what enterprise was a success, read on the one dollar bill at the bottom
of the pyramid, Novus Ordo Seclorum. Which translates as the "New Order of
the World"
The New World Order!
Now, we must remember that Germany was the
home of the concept of The New World Order.
Adolph Hitler's entire motivation was to establish a "new world order." But,
in order to establish a new world order, you have to destroy the old world
order. And, that is exactly what Hitler set out to do, destroy all of the
old aristocracy, familial power bases in Europe, and then set up a new world
order. This brings us now to the Masonic Lodges in the South of Germany, and
their connections with the French Revolution.
There is a tremendous amount
of information on that subject, but we won't go into that here. Suffice it
to say, that there was an immense amount of Freemasonic activity involved
with the French Revolution, in the Mexican Revolution and the American
Revolution, and in all other revolutions going on throughout the world.
There are many, many instances of Freemasons in government, Freemasons in
banking, and Freemasons in fraternal orders, operating and working together,
but we don't know about all of the hidden agendas. While our people were
preparing to go into the Middle East, the Gulf War, we were not aware of the
facts of what was really going on in the Middle East. That was a war
designed between secret societies, factions, occult movements that we didn't
know anything about. It has nothing whatsoever to do with oil, has nothing
whatsoever to do with a conflict that America should be concerned with.
It has to do with some very old and ancient
Freemasonic strategy.
The world can therefore seize the
opportunity [Persian Gulf crisis] to fulfill the long-held promise of a
New World Order where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause
to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind.
George Bush, U.S. President at
the time
I would like to demonstrate a point to you from
this book, Fire in the Minds of Men, something very interesting and
important, as we get into the symbols of the Illuminati and symbols of the
Freemasonic orders of the world.
On page 6, recounted in the Introduction, it
says:
European aristocracies transferred their
lighted candles from Christian altars to Masonic lodges. The flame of
occult alchemists, which had promised to turn dross into gold,
reappeared at the center of new "circles" seeking to recreate a golden
age: Bavarian Illuminists conspiring against the Jesuits, French
Philadelphians against Napoleon, Italian charcoal burners against
Hapsburgs.
Always two sides. He continued by saying that
the mythic model for revolutionaries during the time of Marx and Lenin was
Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods for the use of mankind. The
Promethean faith of revolutionaries used the flame, or light, in a strong
symbolic fashion. It was the central theme.
Here's the point.
Consider a more pointed millennial assumption, that on the
"new day" that was dawning, the sun would never set. Early during the French
Revolution was born the "solar myth of the Revolution," suggesting that the
sun was rising on a new era in which darkness would vanish forever. This
image became implanted at a level of consciousness that was simultaneously
interpreted as something real and would ultimately produce a new reality.
The new reality they sought was radically secular and stringently simple.
The idea was not the balanced complexity of the new American Federation, but
the occult simplicity of its great seal, an all-seeing eye atop a pyramid,
over the words Novus Ordo Seclorum.
