Patrick Clawson, member of the
globalist-controlled think-tank and neo-con influenced
Washington Institute for Near
East Studies (WINES).
Recently spoke about the use of false flags as a
necessary way for instigating a war with Iran. Clawson remarked that Obama
has had a difficult time getting the US into a war with Iran and
advocating the use of conventional means (i.e. using a false flag to provoke
a military strike).
Clawson said:
If in fact Iran is not going to compromise,
then it would be best if someone else started the war... One can combine
other means of pressure with sanctions.
We could step up the pressure. I
mean, look people - Iranian submarines go down all the time. What if one
of them did not come back up? Who would know why?
The WINES was founded by Martin Indyk, an
academic and deputy of research for the Zionist lobby the
American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).
Through AIPAC, the US government supplies Israel
with:
-
Defense intelligence and military
security
-
Counterterrorism
-
Technologies that facilitate defense and
military equipment
-
Science and agricultural products
The WINES attempts to coerce the US Congress
into following their recommendations with conferences, the
Military Fellows
Program (which has ties to the Council on Foreign Relations and the RAND
Corporation), the Center
for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, and secret meetings; as
well as a multitude of publications and research reports.
WINES instill Zionist propaganda and demonize
Arabs and Muslims.
However, they are hand-in-hand with one of the
largest Zionist-controlled and pro-Israeli lobby in the US. The neocon phenomenon consists of Zionists and
sympathizers that dictate and coerce US foreign policy to reflect the
agendas of the Zionist regime.
According to neocon Irving Kristol, founder
of the movement and the
Commentary
Magazine, the neoconservative agenda is explained as:
The historical task and political purpose
of neo-conservatism is to convert the Republican Party and American
conservatism in general, against their prospective wills, into a new
kind of conservative politics suitable to governing a modern democracy.
Kristol believes that the US can be compared to
the Soviet Union in ideology and interests.
The US will then always feel obliged to
defend a democratic nation under attack from non-democratic forces,
external or internal. That is why we feel it is necessary to defend
Israel when its survival is threatened. No complicated geopolitical
calculations of national interest are necessary.
Prominent neocons have purveyed the Zionist
agenda such as,
-
Paul Wolfowitz
-
Richard Perle
-
Jeanne Kilpatrick
-
Norman Podheretz
-
Joshua Goldberg,
...and many others.
Evidence of the power of WINES was manifest in
the bill
HR
4133 which allocates US resources to Israel at the expense of the
taxpayer.
This legislation marks Obamas
unwavering commitment to Israel as a puppet of the global Elite. Israel
may siphon money from
the Federal Reserve, use the US military at their whim
and expect the backing of the US government during provoked attacks of other
Middle Eastern sovereign nations.
Mainstream media is following the Zionist script
to the letter in regard to the false claims of Iranian endeavors to build
nuclear weapons. Now there are
reports that Iran is capable of launching a pre-emptive strike should
Israel attack, as they are threatening to do.
According to Amir Ali Hajizadeh, brigadier
general for the CIA-sponsored
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps states that:
Iran will not start any
war but it could launch a pre-emptive attack if it was sure that the enemies
are putting the final touches to attack it.
Hajizadeh explains that the Zionist-controlled
Israeli government will not start,
a war without Americas support.
Therefore, in case of a war, we will get into a war with both of them and we
will certainly get into a conflict with American bases.
Other
propaganda purveyed by an anonymous expert claims that Iran,
will attack
the forces of the US or any country that tries to take out its nuclear
program are not mere boasts, experts say, but any such strike could be met
with devastating counterattacks.
The Zionist regime are continuously decrying
that Iran has a nuclear weapon.
However, this is an old game they are
playing and the American publics memory may be too short to recall how many
times this lie has been perpetrated.
In the past, there have been several
claims by Israeli Prime Minister and globalist puppet Benjamin Netanyahu
and other supporters of the lie that Iran was on the precipice of having a
nuclear weapon.
-
In 1992, Netanyahu predicts that Iran
was 3 to 5 years from having a nuclear weapon.
-
In 1992, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres predicts an Iranian nuclear warhead by 1999 to French TV.
-
In 1995, New York Times reports US and
Israel claim Iran would have the bomb by 2000.
-
In 1998, speaking before Congress Donald
Rumsfeld proclaims Iran could have an intercontinental ballistic
missile that could hit the US by 2003.
The reality is that between 1985 and 2002 the
Israeli Ministry of Defense used shell corporations to
smuggle nuclear triggers from the US.
One of the operatives, Richard Kelly Smith, met
with Netanyahu who worked for one of the shell corporations called
Heli Trading Company and was an integral part of the smuggling ring.
In the 1950s the US
assisted
Iranian nuclear endeavors with the aid of Atoms for Peace program that
united the US and other European governments to contribute to Irans nuclear
program until the state-sponsored removal of the Shah of Iran.
When the US-friendly Ayatollah Khomeini was
installed, he disbanded the nuclear program citing conflictions of nuclear
weapons with the Quran. Still,
mainstream media
continues to sound the alarm that Iran not only has nuclear weapons, but
will strike US bases if attacked by Israel.
While Iran maintains that their nuclear program
is to develop power for their nation, Israeli officials, including Netanyahu
say:
Those in the international community who
refuse to put red lines before Iran dont have a moral right to place a
red light before Israel.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
explains that Iran does not take the Zionist regimes threats of
military strike seriously. Ahmadinejad asserts that Iran is quite capable
of defending itself against an attack with Israeli armed forces.
He also
said that Iran views the Zionists at a dead end and scrambling to gain
ground and maintain power.
