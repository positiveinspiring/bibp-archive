Files of up to 6GB in size
showing up in a hidden directory.
You might be in the process of acquiring Windows 10 - whether you want the free upgrade or not.
Microsoft has confirmed that it is,
"helping upgradable devices get ready for Windows 10 by downloading the files they need",
...in the event that owners decide to migrate to the new OS, even if they have heretofore passed up on "reserving" their free upgrade from Windows 7 or 8.
The issue seems to revolve around the Microsoft update KB3035583, and as such it appears to only afflict individuals who have chosen to receive automatic updates.
As far as we can tell, if you have automatic updates turned off, Windows 10 won't be pre-loaded onto your PC.
According to The Inquirer, the situation was first reported by an anonymous reader who claimed to have discovered a hidden directory called $Windows.~BT on his computer, despite not opting in for a free upgrade to Windows 10.
$Windows.~BT
The directory weighed in at "3.5GB to 6GB," according to the reader.
"I thought Microsoft [said] this 'upgrade' was optional. If so, why is it being pushed out to so many computers where it wasn't reserved, and why does it try to install over and over again?" he told the outlet.
His concerns are mirrored by numerous people across the Internet, who have been reporting similar revelations since as early as July.
Getting rid of the unwanted files isn't as quite as simple as clicking the delete button, unfortunately. But it doesn't require any significant computer knowledge, either.
Addictive Tips has a concise solution for the dilemma, which involves uninstalling the KB3035583 update prior to removing the actual folder.
While potentially disconcerting at first blush, the news isn't exactly a shocker. Microsoft has been aggressive about promoting Windows 10, bombarding Windows 7 & 8 users with pop-ups suggesting the change.
More crucially, by opting for automatic upgrades, a user is essentially agreeing to allow software developers to do as they will - in this case, proactively downloading Windows 10 in preparation for any changes of heart.
Here's Microsoft's statement to The Inquirer, in full:
For individuals who have chosen to receive automatic updates through Windows Update, we help upgradable devices get ready for Windows 10 by downloading the files they'll need if they decide to upgrade. When the upgrade is ready, the customer will be prompted to install Windows 10 on the device.
