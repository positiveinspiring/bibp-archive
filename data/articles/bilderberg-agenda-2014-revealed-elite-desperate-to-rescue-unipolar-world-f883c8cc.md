Anti-EU revolution,
Ukraine crisis threaten
to derail global government
The 2014 Bilderberg
meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark is taking place amidst a
climate of panic for many of the 120 globalists set to
attend the secretive confab, with Russias intransigence
on the crisis in Ukraine and the anti-EU revolution
sweeping Europe posing a serious threat to the unipolar
world order Bilderberg spent over 60 years helping to
build.
Inside sources confirm to Infowars that the
elite conference, which will take place from Thursday onwards at the five
star Marriott Hotel, will center around how to derail a global political
awakening that threatens to hinder Bilderbergs long standing agenda to
centralize power into a one world political federation, a goal set to be
advanced with the passage of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership (TTIP), which will undoubtedly be a central topic of discussion
at this years meeting.
The TTIP represents an integral component of
Bilderbergs attempt to rescue the unipolar world by creating a
"world
company," initially a free trade area, which would connect the United States
with Europe. Just as the European Union started as a mere free trade area
and was eventually transformed into a political federation which controls
upwards of 50 per cent of its member states laws and regulations with total
contempt for national sovereignty and democracy, TTIP is designed to
accomplish the same goal, only on a bigger scale.
The deal is being spearheaded by Obamas U.S.
Trade Representative Michael Froman, a Wall Street insider and a
CFR member,
Bilderbergs sister organization.
Froman is simultaneously helping to build
another block of this global government, the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP),
which is a similar project involving Asian countries.
Given that Bilderberg schemed to create the Euro
single currency
as far back as 1955 (Bilderberg chairman
Ã‰tienne Davignon
bragged about how the Euro single currency was a
brainchild of the Bilderberg in 2009 interview), the results of the European
elections are sure to have stirred outright alarm amongst Bilderberg
globalists who are aghast that their planned EU super-state is being eroded
as a result of a populist resistance mainly centered around animosity
towards uncontrolled immigration policies.
In Denmark itself, the buzz is centered around
Morten Messerschmidt and the Danish Peoples party, which won 27% of the
vote in the Euro elections and doubled its number of MEPs. Although some are
wary of Messerschmidts far right inclinations, his success reflects a
general resentment not only in Denmark but across Europe towards immigration
and the welfare state, concerns that the EU has only exasperated.
Meanwhile in France,
Marine Le Pen
is carving out a role as the face of a conservative
movement that threatens "to break up one united Europe," with her European
election win being described as an "earthquake" that has rattled the
political heart of Europe.
Voters in the United Kingdom also delivered a
thumping rejection of the EU and in turn Bilderberg with the success of
Nigel Farage and UKIP, a Euroskeptic triumph
some are labeling the "most extraordinary" election result for 100
years.
As well as TTIP and the fallout from the
European election disaster, Bilderberg will be tackling a number of other
key issues, most of which will revolve around the continued effort to
centralize economic power under several different guises, including a carbon
tax paid directly to
the United Nations, with the financial hit being taken
by individuals as big companies are granted special "waivers" that will
allow them to continue to pollute.
The rumbling crisis in Ukraine and the
relationship between Russia and NATO will also be a focal point of
Bilderberg 2014.
Globalists now consider Vladimir Putin to have ostracized
Russia from
the New World Order because he dared to "challenge the
international system," as John Kerry put it.
Bilderberg will discuss fears that Putin is
intent on constructing an alternative world order based around the BRICS
countries, a "multi-polar" system that would devastate the dollar as the
world reserve currency and also heavily dilute the current US-EU-NATO power
axis.
