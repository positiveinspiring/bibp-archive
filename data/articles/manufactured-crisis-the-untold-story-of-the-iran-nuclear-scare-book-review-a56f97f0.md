Review of Gareth Porter's recently
released book
Since the early 1990s, Israel, U.S. officials and their submissive European
allies, supported by their
uncritical and subservient media, have been
peddling allegations, fabrications, accusations and lies that the government
of Iran was pursuing a secret, military adjunct to its regularly inspected
civilian nuclear program.
The main thrust of Porter's book ('Manufactured
Crisis - The Untold Story of the Iran Nuclear Scare') is to
demonstrate that this crisis was "manufactured" and the accusations were
bogus, i.e. Iran never had a military nuclear program.
For over 20 years Israeli politicians have been
claiming that Iran's nuclear device was just around the corner.
Despite the political hullabaloo and Netanyahu's call for military actions
against Iran's nuclear installations,
"Netanyahu never intended to use military
force against Iran, and the Obama administration was well aware of that
but was hoping to exploit the threat to gain diplomatic leverage on
Iran", writes Porter.
President Obama, under severe pressure from
Israel, its
Zionist
lobby AIPAC (American Israeli Public Affairs Committee)
together with the large majority of Congress, has been leading a worldwide
effort to impose crippling sanctions on Iran to force it to give up its
alleged nuclear-weapons program.
Up until now, there exists no evidence that Iran
carried out a military nuclear program.
Beyond that, Gareth Porter, a historian
and investigative journalist specializing in US foreign and military policy,
demonstrates that the so-called stolen documents, which apparently
"proved" Iran's covert nuclear program, were "fraudulent".
These "mysterious documents" were allegedly
smuggled out of Iran on a laptop. The author unravels the contradictions
between the material in the documents and well-established facts.
Did the U.S. rely for its "evidence" on Israeli
intelligence services?
Manufactured Crisis - The Untold Story of the Iran
Nuclear Scare
Porter shows how Israel, the
George W. Bush and later the
Obama
administration, successfully portrayed the various actions taken
by Western nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
as responses to a long history of Iranian covert militarization of its
nuclear program.
Iran started its nuclear program under Reza
Shah Pahlavi. At that time, the U.S. and Israel were allied with the
Persian dictator and didn't mind a nuclear Iran.
After the overthrow of the Shah regime in 1979,
however, the United States intervened aggressively, as early as 1983, to
prevent Iran from pursuing its legitimate right to peaceful nuclear power.
It was these aggressive efforts by the U.S., that forced Iran to resort to
black market transactions in order to acquire the technology needed for its
civilian nuclear program, writes Porter.
So far, the U.S. and Israel have done all they can to sabotage the Iranian
nuclear program by, inter alia, sending hit men to assassinate Iranian
nuclear scientists and infect the computers of the nuclear installations
with malware.
According to the online newspaper "The Times of
Israel" from March 19, 2014, the Israeli Chief of Staff Benny Gantz
revealed in a speech delivered before a class of students that,
"Israel had already conducted dozens of
covert operations in foreign and enemy countries", and that "Our Air
Force is wherever we wanted it to be."
He added confidently that Iran is not beyond the
IDF's reach.
According to Porter, there exists a tendency and
a power structure inside the Beltway that keeps readiness and permanent
preparedness for war despite the Vietnam disaster.
Does such a mentality also exist within the
Israeli security establishment?
In his introduction the author submits that,
"U.S.-Israeli strategy was aimed at using
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to build a case that
Iran's nuclear program had been merely a cover for a nuclear weapons
program.
That case would serve as the basis for
United Nations Security Council actions that would punish Iran, or even
for unilateral US military action against Iran.
As a result the IAEA, which had previously
been a relatively nonpolitical actor performing technical analysis of
nuclear programs, was transformed over the 2003-8 period into an adjunct
of the anti-Iran strategy."
Porter describes three stages that form the
basis for the progress and the escalation of the crisis.
Yet, he does not view each step by the U.S. and
Israel as part of a master plan. On the contrary, he argues that each stage
of the strategy developed in response to political developments and
problems, which emerged from further coercing Iran on the nuclear issue.
The first stage was triggered by the Iranian
terrorist group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK),
which revealed at a August 2002 press conference Iran's Natanz enrichment
facility.
MEK was removed a few months ago from the U.S.
"terror list".
In 2008, the second stage was triggered when the
U.S. obtained from an unknown party stolen documents about a secret nuclear
program. At the end of 2011, the third stage started by imposing new and
more severe sanctions, targeting Iran's oil export and banking sectors.
This new round of sanctions was triggered by an
IAEA report based on Israeli sources.
In chapter three, the author discusses Iran's leadership attitude towards
nuclear and chemical weapons.
When Iraq, with massive support by the U.S., its
Western cronies but also the Soviet Union, attacked Iran and used chemical
weapons obtained from the U.S., Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa
(religious Islamic ruling), forgoing the use of chemical weapons against
Iraqis.
The West dismissed his ruling as a deception and
a lie.
With the same arrogance another fatwa by
Khomeini's successor Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the prohibition of
nuclear weapons was disregarded. Western media promoted this racist attitude
uncritically around the globe.
In the early 1990s, the U.S. portrayed Iran's civilian nuclear program as a
cover for its alleged ambitions to acquire nuclear weapons. In chapter four,
the author shows that this accusation was intended to manufacture a new
scapegoat to replace the communist scapegoat imploded at the end of 1991.
The supposed threat of nuclear proliferation
from Iran was a useful theory for the Pentagon and the CIA.
Under the Clinton presidency Israel was
brought into the picture. The other half of the story is told in chapter
five. Due to the demonization of Iran, successive Israeli governments from
Yitzhak Rabin to Benjamin Netanyahu attempted to achieve political and
strategic aims that had nothing to do with Iran.
Israel had also to pay a political price for its
aggressive posture. Reciprocally, Iran regarded Israel as a military threat,
writes Porter.
In 2003, then Iranian president Mohammed Khatami offered negotiations
with the U.S. the George W. Bush administration rejected it off-hand because
Iran was a "rogue state" and to ranked top on the so-called "axis of evil".
WikiLeaks published cables demonstrating
how closely the IAEA cooperated with the U.S. government. Under the
leadership of Yukiya Amano, the reputation of the IAEA went down the
drain.
Until the end of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's term in office, the
Obama
administration together with
Israel's Benyamin Netanyahu
tried to bully Iran into submission.
With the election of the new President Hassan
Rohani the demonization of the Iranian leadership did not work anymore.
With the start of the negotiations, Israel and the Congress called for even
more sanctions. In his State of the Union Address, President Obama rejected
such sanctions, saying that negotiations are in the national interest of the
U.S.
Officially, AIPAC and its servants on Capitol
Hill pursued their endeavor in more discreetly. As an outside observer, it
is mind-boggling to observe how U.S. representatives on the Hill work
against their own government and the interest of their country.
Manufactured Crisis presents the first alternative narrative to the
Iranian nuclear issue.
The author shows what disastrous impact the
U.S.-Israeli alliance has on
the
Middle Eastern region. This fateful partnership is rooted in
America's domestic politics. The Gordian knot must be untied for the benefit
of the American people.
At the end of the book, one gets the impression
that the "Iranian problem" is a U.S. one, or to put it differently, the
U.S. problem is the alliance with Israel and the American political
class inside the Beltway.
Gareth Porter's well researched book
presents readers with a clear view,
so that they can see through the web of
lies, deceptions and false accusations,
to discover the real enemies of peace.
A timely book more than worth reading.
