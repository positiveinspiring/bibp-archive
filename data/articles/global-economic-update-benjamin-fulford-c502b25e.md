[11/20/09 2:07:05 AM] Kerry Cassidy: we
received the following message:
[11/20/09 2:07:07 AM] Kerry Cassidy:
I do not normally pass on rumors or
here-say, but a very good personal friend's uncle is a Deputy Economic
Advisor to Obama as well as a Professor at a prestigious Eastern School.
He was called into a private meeting last week with the President.
They were told, I quote, the following:
"Between now and Jan 1st, 70 more big
banks will fail and 70% of Retail Companies will be Bankrupt. The
President will allow them to make as much as they can for the
Christmas Holidays then January 15 (2010) there will be a Bank Holiday and
their new currency will be issued with a devaluation of 6 to 10 to
1.
"I believe this is why they are trying
to keep the market and dollar up now with their lies on all the News
outlets. Set up the people to steal every last penny they can get.
Martial Law cannot be too far behind. Get your money out of banks
and into physical Gold and silver. I recommend 60% gold 40% silver,
food, foundation seed, gun ammo, generators... etc.
If you cannot eat, drink it, wear it,
live in it, raise food on it, do not invest in it. If you have
stocks, bonds 401K Ira, take the penalty and put it in what I just
said."
[11/20/09 2:13:08 AM] Benjamin Fulford: That
jives with what I am hearing from multiple high-level sources. Please
pass on to your pentagon and agency connections that once the
Federal
Reserve Board is bankrupt, serious money will be made available for the
constitutional US government
[11/20/09 2:14:12 AM] Benjamin Fulford:
Martial law and a 90% devaluation is a much worse choice than announcing
a return to the constitution. The American people are not liable for the
over $100 trillion in Fed debt if the Fed goes bankrupt
[11/20/09 2:14:34 AM] Benjamin Fulford: We
can do an interview right now if you want
[11/20/09 2:14:51 AM] Kerry Cassidy: OK
great hold on one minute
[11/20/09 2:18:53 AM] Kerry Cassidy: OK
calling you...
