Warn or
War
Were already at war in numerous countries
all over the world.
But top economic advisers warn that economic
factors could lead to a new world war.
Kyle Bass
writes:
Trillions of dollars of
debts will be restructured and millions of financially prudent
savers will lose large percentages of their real purchasing power at
exactly the wrong time in their lives.
Again, the world will not end, but the
social fabric of the profligate nations will be stretched and in some
cases torn. Sadly, looking back through economic history,
all too often war is the manifestation
of simple economic entropy played to its logical conclusion.
We
believe that war is an inevitable consequence of the current global
economic situation.
Larry Edelson wrote an email to
subscribers entitled "What the 'Cycles of War' are saying for 2013", which
states:
Since the 1980s, Ive been studying the
so-called "cycles of war" - the natural rhythms that predispose
societies to descend into chaos, into hatred, into civil and even
international war.
Im certainly not the first person to
examine these very distinctive patterns in history. There have been many
before me, notably, Raymond Wheeler, who published the most
authoritative chronicle of war ever, covering a period of 2,600 years of
data.
However, there are very few people who are
willing to even discuss the issue right now. And based on what Im
seeing, the implications could be absolutely huge in 2013.
Former Goldman Sachs technical analyst
Charles Nenner - who has made some big accurate calls, and counts major
hedge funds, banks, brokerage houses, and high net worth individuals as
clients -
says there will be "a major war starting at the end of 2012 to 2013",
which will drive the Dow to 5,000.
Veteran investor adviser James Dines
forecast a war is epochal as World Wars I and II, starting in the Middle
East.
Nouriel Roubini has
warned of war
with Iran.
And when Roubini was asked:
Where does this all lead us? The risk in
your view is of another Great Depression. But even respectable European
politicians are talking not just an economic depression but possibly
even worse consequences over the next decade or so.
Bearing European history in mind, where does
this take us?
He
responded:
In the 1930s, because we made a major policy
mistake, we went through financial instability, defaults, currency
devaluations, printing money, capital controls, trade wars, populism, a
bunch of radical, populist, aggressive regimes coming to power from
Germany to Italy to Spain to Japan, and then we ended up with World War
II.
Now Im not predicting World War III but
seriously, if there was a global financial crisis after the first one,
then we go into depression: the political and social instability in
Europe and other advanced economies is going to become extremely severe.
And thats something we have to worry about.
Billionaire investor Jim Rogers
notes:
A continuation of bailouts in Europe could
ultimately
spark another world war, says international investor Jim Rogers.

"Add debt, the situation gets worse, and
eventually it just collapses. Then
everybody is looking for scapegoats. Politicians blame foreigners, and
were in World War II or World War whatever."
Marc Faber
says that the American government will
start new wars in response to the economic crisis:
Faber also
believes the U.S., China and Russia may go to war
over Mideast oil:
Were in the middle of a
global currency war - i.e. a situation where nations all compete to
devalue their currencies the most in order to boost exports.
And Brazilian president-elect Rousseff
said in 2010:
The last time there was a series of
competitive devaluations
it ended in world war two.
Jim Rickards
agrees:
Currency wars lead to trade wars, which
often lead to hot wars. In 2009, Rickards participated in the Pentagons
first-ever "financial" war games.
While expressing confidence in Americas
ability to defeat any other nation-state in battle, Rickards says the
U.S. could get dragged into "asymmetric warfare," if currency wars lead
to rising inflation and global economic uncertainty.
As does
Jim Rogers:
Trade wars always lead to wars.
Martin Armstrong
wrote in August:
Our greatest problem is
the bureaucracy wants a war.
This will distract everyone from the NSA and justify what they have been
doing. They need a distraction for the
economic decline that is coming.
Armstrong argued last month that war plans
against Syria are really about
debt and spending:
The Syrian mess seems to have people lining
up on Capital Hill when sources there say the phone calls coming in are
overwhelmingly against any action.
The politicians are ignoring the
people entirely.
This suggests there is indeed a secret
agenda to achieve a goal outside the discussion box. That is most like
the debt problem and a war is necessary
to relief the pressure to curtail spending.
And given that many influential economists
wrongly believe that war is good for the
economy
many are
overtly or quietly pushing for war.
Moreover, former Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan said that
the Iraq war was really about oil , and
former Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill
says that Bush planned the Iraq war before 9/11. And see
this and
this.
If that war was for petroleum, other oil-rich
countries might be invaded as well.
And the American policy of
using the military to contain Chinas growing economic
influence - and of considering
economic rivalry to be a basis for war -
are creating a tinderbox.
Finally, multi-billionaire investor Hugo
Salinas Price
says:
What happened to [Libya's] Mr. Gaddafi, many
speculate the real reason he was ousted was that he was planning an
all-African currency for conducting trade.
The same thing happened to him that happened
to Saddam because the US doesnt want any solid competing currency out
there vs. the dollar. You know Gaddafi was talking about a
gold dinar.
Indeed, senior CNBC editor John Carney
noted:
Is this the first time a revolutionary group
has created a central bank while it is still in the midst of fighting
the entrenched political power? It certainly seems to indicate how
extraordinarily powerful central bankers have become in our era.
Robert Wenzel of
Economic Policy Journal thinks the
central
banking initiative reveals that foreign
powers may have a strong influence over the rebels.
This suggests we have a bit more than a
ragtag bunch of rebels running around and that there are some pretty
sophisticated influences. "I have never before heard of a central bank
being created in just a matter of weeks out of a popular uprising,"
Wenzel writes.
Indeed,
some say that recent wars have really been about bringing all countries
into the fold of Western central banking.
Many Warn of Unrest
Numerous economic organizations and economists
also warn of crash-induced unrest, including:
