World War Two ended in Europe with the armored divisions
of U.S. General George S. Patton's Third Army lunging deep into the
tottering Third Reich, toward Arnstadt in Thuringia and toward the immense
Skoda munitions works at Pilsen, Czechoslovakia. This little appreciated
fact links together two of the war's most famous and powerful generals
and perhaps affords a basis to speculate on the real reasons for the
mysterious death of the one, and the equally mysterious "death"
of the other.
The generals in question are General Patton, well-known
to military history and America's most famous and capable field commander
during the war in Europe, and SS Obergruppenfuhrer Dr. Ing. (doctor
of engineering) Hans Kammler, now little known to popular history, architect
of the infamous Auschwitz death camps, responsible for the demolition
of the Warsaw ghetto, and by the end of the war, the Third Reich's plenipotentiary
for all secret weapons research, responsible directly to Reichsfuhrer
SS Heinrich Himmler and to Adolf Hitler himself.
A. Introduction: The Rediscovery of the SS Sonderkommando,
Kammler, and a Brush with "the Legend"
As previous chapters have indicated, there is some
entity within the Third Reich that appears to have coordinated extremely
sensitive and secret weapons research projects, including possible oversight
of Germany's apparently large uranium enrichment program. However, this
entity, as we shall subsequently see, was responsible for a great deal
more than that. It is necessary at this juncture to say something about
it, however, as it now directly enters the picture in the speculative
reconstruction of the strange death of the one, and the disappearance
of the other, of these two very important generals.
This entity first came to public light in the aftermath
of World War Two, in the 1950s, in a series of publications in West
Germany, and in a book by former German major Rudolf Lusar. These publications
alleged that Nazi Germany had created and successfully tested "unusual"
aircraft, including flying disks or saucers. Thus was born the "Nazi
Legend" of the "real origin" of UFOs. More will be said
about this Legend in the subsequent parts of this book. Here it suffices
to note that the Nazi Legend maintained that this secretive development
occurred under the direct auspices of the SS.
The allegations of an ultra-top secret entity coordinating
and controlling the Nazi secret weapons research in the final years
of the war tended to be discounted, along with its more sensation component,
the "flying saucers" themselves. Moreover, discounting these
allegations was easy to do, since they rested upon the isolated testimony
of a disenchanted German major with definite Nazi sympathies (Lusar)
and the "eye witness" statements of one or two others who
came forward to corroborate the story, each with their own shady associations.
All that gradually began to change, however, by a
sequence of events ranging from the publication of a book by a former
British intelligence officer, Tom Agoston, in 1985, by the German reunification
itself in 1989, which made a host of archives of the former East Germany
available to researchers. A number of books has appeared in Germany since the reunification made
these archives accessible, and moreover, the formerly inaccessible SS
secret underground facilities and complexes finally became accessible
to the public. Aided and abetted in their efforts by the declassification
of several documents by the Clinton administration in the United States,
German researchers began to probe the new information, reconnecting
the dots, and presenting a chilling picture of the actual state of Nazi
wartime research and its enormous discrepancy with the postwar Allied
Legend.
This body of work has been almost entirely ignored in North
America.2 Agoston's work was the first indication
from the "mainstream" that there may have been something behind
the Nazi Legend. Agoston revealed his story for the first time after
his source, none other than close Kammler associate at the famous Skoda
Works, Dr. Wilhelm Voss, died. The story that Voss told Agoston at the
end of the war was, according to Agoston, in confidence.
As Agoston notes rather sarcastically,
Kammler boasted
almost the perfect "corporate resume" and a documentable record
of "whole person management" as a "team player":
A modern day management consultant who was talent hunting
for a "total professional with total involvement" would certainly
have been fascinated by the bizarre curriculum vitae Kammler could have
submitted. He could demonstrate a "track record" in "very
senior appointments," with skill in putting across "aggressive
growth plans."...
The most prominent post-reunification German sources
for this story are Friedrich Georg's series on secret weapons, Hitler's
Siegeswaffen series in three volumes; and the studies of Edgar Mayer
and Thomas Mehner, Das Geheimnis der Deutschen Atombombe;
Die Atombombe
und das Dritte Reich; Hitler un die "Bombe"; Harald Fath's 1945
-Tthuringens Manhattan Projekt ami Geheime Kommandosache -S III Jonastal
und die Seigeswaffenproduktion.
Also not to be neglected is Robert K.
Wilcox's Japan's Secret War: Japan's Race against Time to Build its
Own Atomic Bomb, for the latter book raises the question of where Japan
acquired its enrichment capability and stocks of uranium in no uncertain
terms (see chapter 7 of this book). Also important is Karl Heinz Zunneck's
Geheimtechnologien, Wunderwaffen und die irdischen Facetten des UFO-Phanomens.
In the the Third Reich, within a span of
a few years, the number of positions he had held in turn was phenomenal.3
Among these "senior appointments"
Kammler
once commanded were:
-
(1)
Operational control of the V-l and V-2 terror
bombardments of London, Liege, Brussels, Antwerp and Paris;
-
(2)
Operational control of all missile production
and research, including the V-2 and the intercontinental ballistic
missile. the A9/10;
-
-
(3)
Design and construction oversight of the world's
"first bombproof underground aircraft and missile factory sites,"
including sites for the production of jet engines and the Messerschmitt
262;
-
-
(4)
command of the SS Building and Words Division,
the department which handled all large construction projects for
the Reich, including death camps, "buna factories," and
supply roads for invading German legions in Russia;
-
-
(5)
Design and construction of the world's first underground
testing and proving range for missiles;
-
-
(6)
Command, control and coordination of all of the
Third Reich's secret weapons research by the war's end.4
This warped and twisted administrative genius first
came to the attention of Himmler and Hitler,
"with a brilliant hand-colored
design for the Auschwitz concentration camp, which he subsequently built.
Later he was called in to advise on the modalities for boosting the
daily output of its gas chambers from 10,000 to 60,000."5
3 Tom
Agoston, op. cit., p. 5.
4 Agoston, pp. 5-6.
5 Ibid., p. 6.
All this is to say that not only was Kammler a butcher,
but that by the war's end, Hitler had "concentrated more power
in Kammler's hands than he had ever entrusted to a single person," bar none.6
If one were to compare Kammler's position to a similar hypothetical
position in the former Soviet Union, such a position
would mean that the general who (commanded) the SS-20 rockets in Europe
and Asia (the Commander in Chief of Strategic Rocket Forces) would also
head research, development, and production of missiles.
In addition,
he would be in charge of producing all modern aircraft for the Red Air
Force and have overall command of the mammoth civil engineering projects
or the production centers in Siberia's sub-zero climate. Last, but very
much not least, he would lead the national grid of gulags. To match Kammler's position in the SS, the Soviet general holding all these variegated
commands would also be third in the KGB pecking order.7
6 Agoston,
op. cit., p. 4.
7 Ibid., p. 7.
Indeed, one would have to add to Agoston's list, for
such a Soviet general would also have had to
be in charge of the coordination of all the most
post-nuclear and super secret advanced scientific research
and black projects in the entire Soviet Union. It
is thus in the person of SS Obergruppenfuhrer Hans Kammler that
all the lines of our investigation meet: the Buna factory and slave
labor of the camps, exploited for grizzly medical experimentation
and labor in the secret underground laboratories and
production facilities, the atom bomb project, and as will be seen in
the subsequent parts of this book, even more horrendous and monstrous
aircraft and weapons development.
If there was a gold
mine of information, then it was available in the blueprints and files
that were locked in Kammler's vaults, or even more securely in his
brain. It is this fact and Kammler's extraordinary dossier that make
his post-war fate even more problematical. But what of Kammler's "Special
SS Command" (Sonderkommando) structure itself?
What was it that was so revolutionary that Dr.
Voss would have required Agoston to maintain
confidentiality until after his death?
Voss had joined Skoda in 1938, when the plant was
ceded to the Reich under the Munich Pact - Hitler, Chamberlain, Mussolini
and Daladier, allotting the Sudeten German areas of Czechoslovakia to
Germany and became an affiliate of Hitler's principle arms
maker Krupp. With his flair for quiet diplomacy, Voss was immensely
popular with the Czech executives, who had remained in leading positions
at the time of the German takeover of Skoda. Voss even saw to it that
Czech workers, paid on the local and not Reich wages, were paid more
8 money.
Also important to the Skoda-SS relationship is the
fact that all of Bohemian Czechoslovakia became a "Reich Protectorate,"
in effect turning total political, administrative, and military control
of Bohemia over to the SS. It is in this context that the special relationship
between Voss and Kammler developed.
By quirk of fate, the careers of Kammler and Voss overlapped
at Skoda, where they jointly set up and operated what was generally
regarded by insiders as the Reich's most advanced high-technology military
research center. Working as a totally independent undercover operation
for the SS, the center was under the special auspices of Hitler and
Himmler. Going outside the scope and field of Skoda's internationally
coveted general research and development division, it worked closely
with Krupp and was primarily concerned with analysis of captured equipment,
including aircraft, and copying or improving the latest technical features.
In so doing the SS group was to go beyond the first generation of secret
weapons.9
8 Agoston,
op. cit, p. 11.
9 Ibid., p. 12.
Thus one has the first component of this Special SS
Command: the analysis, duplication, and improvement of all recovered
foreign and enemy technology. This in itself is not surprising, since
all major combatants during the war maintained such research facilities.
The second thing one must note is the careful and deliberate
camouflaging of the SS Special Command inside the normal engineering
division of the Skoda works. But the real operational goals of this
Special command were far more than the mere analysis of captured enemy
equipment, as Voss detailed to Agoston.
Its purpose was to pave the way for building nuclear-powered
aircraft, working on the application of nuclear energy for propelling
missiles and aircraft; laser beams, then still referred to as "death
rays"; a variety of homing rockets and to seek other potential
areas for high- technology breakthrough. In modem high-tech jargon,
the operation would probably be referred to as an "SS research
think tank." Some work on second-generation secret weapons, including
the application of nuclear propulsion for aircraft and missiles, was
already well advanced.10
Nuclear powered aircraft would require the development
and miniaturization of functioning atomic reactors, something the Germans
were not, according to the Allied Legend, supposed to have achieved.
And though the mention of lasers seems to stretch one's credulity beyond
all reason, there is credible evidence that the Germans were up to just
that, and more besides.11 But
the most remarkable thing about this "SS think tank" was that
it was established entirely without the knowledge of Goring, Speer,
or any of the other big-wigs or research centers in the Reich.12
This would not only explain Speer's puzzlement at Jackson's
question that we encountered earlier, but would also explain the apparent
lack of information on the part of the Farm Hall scientists interred
in England after the war. These two facts alone indicate that the SS
Special Command headquartered at the Skoda Works in Pilsen was more
than just a secret weapons project being run through ordinary channels.
Unlike even its Manhattan Project counterpart, it had no connection
to the standard branches of the German military, the German state, or
even the Nazi Party; it was entirely off the books. It is, in every
sense that we have come to know it, a Black Project, coordinating all
black projects in Nazi Germany. So extensive was the mandate given to
this group that if there was a large uranium enrichment program underway
in Germany for the production of atom bombs, then this is the entity
most likely coordinating it.13
10
Agoston, op. cit., p. 12.''
11 Q.v. the remaining parts of this book.
12
Ibid., pp. 12-13.
13 Agoston alludes to the existence and connection
of the uranium enrichment program to the Kammler Staff when he states
"Even fissile uranium-235 was reportedly made available to Berlin's
prime Axis ally.(p. 32)."
While the enormous implications of this
statement are obvious, Agoston does not pursue the atom bomb component
of the Kammler Staff in his book, Moreover, not only did Skoda's "overtly operating
research and development division" work closely with the SS on
some less sensitive projects, it,
"provided a convenient cover for
the Kammler Staff specialists, culled in great secrecy from Germany's
research institutes to supplement the in-house experts. All were picked
for their know-how and not for their Party records, Voss said. All had
to have the ability to tackle visionary projects. "14
The Kammler Staff Special Command even circulated top secret scientific
paper and memos to the various scientists within the group itself via
a central office of scientific reports. Some of these reports were then
used as a basis of recruitment of top scientists.15
So what was the Kammler Staff, or Kammlerstab, as outlined
by Voss and Agoston?
First, it was the continuation of "normal"
science, free of the constraints of Nazi party ideology, but under the
control of the SS! But it was much more. Not only was it a "think
tank," but it was also a central clearing house for ideas, for
mapping out precise technology trees for the acquisition of second and
third generation weapons. But it was more, it was also a fully-funded
research Black Programs coordinating office with its own "inexhaustible"
and expendable labor pool.
All of it was coordinated by SS General
Hans Kammler.
All of it was headquartered at the Skoda Works in Pilsen.
And one more thing. By the war's end, Kammler also
had control of the Reich's heavy-lift long range transport aircraft,
consisting of several Ju 290s and the two enormous Ju 390s, one of which,
according to Agoston, made a polar flight to Japan on March 28, 1945,16
though he surely would have suspected it. The link
of the Auschwitz "Buna plant" to the SS via the death camp
there already provides one link to Kammler, since the "Buna plant"
fell under SS jurisdiction via the camp itself, and thus the connection
to Kammler is direct.
14 Agoston,
op. cit, p. 13, emphasis added.
15 Ibid., p. 14
16 This fact is merely reported
by Agoston without substantiation, leading one to the conclusion that
the source of the information must have been Dr. Voss. It is worth noting
that Nick Cook reports that Kammler had control of the Ju 390s as part
of another SS Special Evacuation Command, which was the
If ever there was a reason for the Allied High Command
to by-pass Berlin and head south to central Germany(Thuringia) and for
Patton's Third Army to make a beeline for Pilsen and Prague, this was
it. Thus, only in the recently revealed context of the existence of
the Kammlerstab do any of the Allied or German military deployments
or operations at the end of the war make any genuine military sense.
The "National Redoubt" story was likely just that, a story
put out by the American OSS to force the Allied commanders to change
objectives, without disclosing the real nature of their concerns, priorities,
and intelligence objectives.
B. The Four Deaths of SS Obergruppenfuhrer Dr. Ing.
Hans Kammler
General Kammler, in addition to his "accomplishments"
in streamlining death camp efficiency, his methodical and efficient
leveling of the ruined Warsaw Ghetto and meticulous accounting of every
last brick and stone removed, his coordination of the most arcane, and
perhaps the biggest, secret weapons black projects program in human
history, has also another odd distinction to his credit. He of all the
high-ranking Nazis indicted and tried at Nuremberg either posthumously
or in absentia, was never formally indicted, much less brought to trial.
He is altogether missing from the docket, and altogether just simply
missing.
Kammler has yet another distinction. He appears to have been
not only a very accomplished messenger of death for others, but also
appears to have achieved the astonishing feat of having died himself
no less than four times, each under different circumstances. Agoston
commented at length on the odd assortment of "facts" surrounding
Kammler's fate: brainchild of none other than
Martin Bormann. The purpose of this special command was to evacuate...
something. Cook reports that one of these enormous Ju 390s simply went
missing at the end of the war.
Analysis of the voluminous documentation (at has accrued
since embarked on the first left of the fascinating project in 1949
shows crude discrepancies, the inconsistencies of which grow with almost
every addition to the mosaic of information that enters the picture
Basically three major facts stand out:
- In almost four decades, official records show no positive confirmation
of Kammler's death. No court of law, no media editor would accept
the uncorroborated statement of "unknown comrades," still
so referred to in official records as conclusive evidence of death
especially if the death was alleged to have taken place in the chaos
of collapsing Germany.
- The record shows no subsequent sworn corroborative statement
Such a statement would automatically have been entered in the Red
Cross and other dossiers on Kammler.
- None of the persons reporting any of the four versions of the
general's death had conformed with the prescribed duty of all servicemen
to detach one-half of a dead man's soldier's paybook or officer's
identity document, to the nearest unit, relevant records office, Red
Cross, or holding power, if the surviving serviceman had become a
prisoner of war, to help notification of next of kin. Germans are
traditionally meticulous and, to say the least, most sentimental in
such matters.
Thus, in spite of,
"the proliferation of unsubstantiated
evidence that permeates all four versions of Kammler's death, the shell
of the case contains sufficient facts to suggest a more than coincidental
pattern of seemingly targeted and organized disinformation."17
The origin of this disinformation, according to Agoston, was
probably within the SS itself, a program necessitated by Kammler's disappearance
and likely treason to one of the victorious Allied powers.
The "first death of General Hans Kammler"
is recounted by Albert Speer himself, in his last book. In this most
simple version, Kammler ordered his adjutant to shoot him. The "suicide"
allegedly took place in Prague as Kammler realized the war was lost
and, according to Speer, "acted in elitist SS loyalty."18
17 Agoston,
op. cit., pp. 102-103, emphasis added.
18 Ibid., p. 103.
As Agoston quips,
"even the most ardent worshipper of Teutonic
creed could not possibly suggest that elitist SS loyalty can be
demonstrated three times, in three locations, and all on the same day."19
The second version of the story, related to Agoston by Kammler's
"civilian" aide Dr. Wilhelm Voss, was that the general took
cyanide somewhere "on the road between Pilsen and Prague on May
9."20
We will have more
to say about Voss's association with Kammler's vast SS secret weapons
think tank in due course. The third version of Kammler's death was doled
out by V-2 rocket expert, General Walter Dornberger, subsequently employed
by the American firm of Bell Aerospace. According to Dornberger, Kammler's
mental and emotional state had quickly deteriorated in the final days
of the war, and the general overheard Kammler ordering his aide to shoot
him if things became "hopeless."21
But this does not square with Dornberger's close associate, Dr.
Werner Von Braun's own recollection of a conversation he overheard between
Kammler and his aide Starck fully two weeks later. According to Von
Braun, Kammler and Starck discussed the possibility of "going underground"
before the Americans arrived, disguising themselves as monks in a nearby
abbey.22 Thus report, if true, is perhaps the most
interesting, since it indicates that Kammler had no intentions of surrendering
himself to any of the Allied powers, but rather, intended to survive,
perhaps independently continuing his oversight of secret weapons development.
Another version of Kammler's death has him giving a
speech to his assembled aides in Prague in early May 1945, dismissing
them from their duties and advising them to return home, and then walking
into a woods where he then shot himself.23 And lastly,
there is a version of Kammler's death that has him dying a typical SS
hero's death, fighting and going down in a blaze of "glory"
in the face of rebelling and revolting Czechs.24
19 Agoston, op. cit, p. 104.
20 Ibid.
21 Ibid., pp. 103-104.
22 Ibid.
23 Ibid., p. 99.
24 Ibid., p. 92.
What emerges from all this is that no one, no where
can advance anything like a consistent account of the date, location,
time, or even method of Kammler's death. Now it is suicide by poison,
then suicide by gunshot, suicide by ordering an aide to shoot him, a
fighting death, or disappearance into a Roman Catholic monastery. Now
he is in Prague, now he isn't; now he's with people, now he isn't; now
he's suffering mental and emotional collapse, now he isn't.
In all likelihood, therefore, Kammler did not die
at all; he disappeared. The important question is, where?
C. The Ironic Death of General George S. Patton
While Obergruppenfuhrer Kammler was busy dying four
times in various locations by various means, another general was busy
lunging his troops with the precision of a surgeon into the nerve centers
of Kammler's black projects empire: General George S. Patton. His troops
formed the spearhead of the Allied lance that, much to the surprise
of the Nazi, Soviet, and Allied field commanders themselves, suddenly
turned from its victorious drive on Berlin to a militarily questionable
operation designed to take the alleged "Nazi redoubt."
By the spring of 1945, the Redoubt had ballooned to
become a major military concern to the Allied High command, "despite
the caveats from British and US military intelligence."25
Agoston traces the origin of the "redoubt" theme of the postwar
Allied Legend to the USA's Office of Strategic Services, or OSS, the
precursor to the modern day CIA. The OSS had apparently not bothered,
according to Agoston, to check out the sources of its intelligence or
the truthfulness of the "redoubt."26 The
final decision to abandon Berlin as a military objective and drive south
toward Thuringia was made by Eisenhower on April 11, 1945.27
25 Agoston, op. cit., p. 22.
26 Ibid., p. 23.
27 Ibid., p. 23. A possibility is that Kammler arranged
to turn over his secret weapons treasure trove to the OSS in exchange
for his life. It could have been arranged by fellow SS General Wolff,
already in negotiation with Allen
Dulles, OSS station chief in Zurich. If so, then the
sudden shift of Allied objectives to south central Germany may have
originated from intelligence originating within the Kammlerstab itself.
This intelligence would have been easily verifiable by Allies who would
naturally have wanted to check its veracity by means of aerial reconnaissance
of the installation sites presumably leaked to them by someone in the
Kammlerstab.
The date of General Eisenhower's decision is crucial,
for it means that the military objective shifted from Berlin toward
south central Germany after the alleged atom bomb test at Ohrdruf on
March 4, 1945. It is therefore possible that the OSS was in receipt
of extremely secret intelligence concerning this weapons program and
its centers of production, for Patton drives his troops with unerring
accuracy right toward this super-secret installations, many of them
underground and carefully camouflaged.
Given the sensitivity of the
Manhattan Project within the structure of the Allied command, it is
also plausible that the OSS decided not to share this information with
the Supreme Allied Command, and proffered the "Redoubt" and
"fleeing Nazis" and a transferred German war archives as a
cover story to sell the Allied command on a shift of objectives away
from Berlin.
If indeed the OSS "Redoubt" reports were a component
of an OSS psychological operation designed against the Allies' own military
command structure, designed to divert Allied military operations to
a gold mine of military technology and research, then one and only one
general was in a position to know the real, and the whole story about
the Redoubt, and what was actually recovered in Thuringia, Pilsen, and
Prague, and that was General George S Patton.
Patton, as his troops
entered the Skoda works at Pilsen and the underground factories and
laboratories at the Three Corners region in Thuringia would have been
privy to the top secret reports of his divisional commanders entering
these super-secret Reich facilities. Patton would thus have a thorough
first hand knowledge of the complete inventory of the Reich's most sensitive
black programs. As Agoston himself notes, without seeming to realize
the importance of his own observations in the light of post-war events,
"the sudden switch in Allied planning.... brought at least one bonanza.
The rapid eastward drive of the US Third Army
brought to Kammler's secret metropolis well ahead of the Russians in
whose designated zone it lay."28 The holy grail
of all this research were the files and blueprints in the central coordination
office of Kammler's black programs think tank inside the Skoda Works
at Pilsen. And it is likely that General Patton therefore knew much
of the general outlines of this treasure trove and what it portended
for future secret weapons development. There is thus a direct and immediate
link between General George S. Patton, General Hans Kammler, and the
little-known world of top secret weapons research that Kammler headed.29
28 Agoston, op. cit., p. 27.
29 This fact is adequately appreciated by Mayer and
Mehner, Das Geheimnis, p. 156.30 Ladislas Farago, Patton: Ordeal and
Triumph, pp. 787-794.
And this in turn may lend some credence to those who
view General Patton's ironic death after the war as being something
more than an ironic accident. The factual circumstances of Patton's
death are plain enough. While on an inspection tour with his driver
and Major General Hobart Gray on December 9, 1945, Patton's car swerved
to avoid hitting a heavy US Army transport truck that had turned in
front of them. Patton's driver, attention momentarily diverted away
from the road by a remark that Patton himself had made, belatedly noticed
the truck in front of them, and swerved the General's car to avoid a
head-on collision.
None of the others involved in the accident were hurt,
and all were able to walk away from the accident. Not so General Patton.
He had suffered a broken neck, and the prognosis was paralysis from
the neck down. From this point the General recovered rapidly at the
military hospital in Frankfurt, making such good progress that until
the afternoon of December 19th, his doctors were seriously considering
moving him to Boston. But that afternoon his breathing difficulties
increased dramatically and suddenly. On December 20th he suffered breathlessness
and pallor, and Patton, who had had a prior history of embolism, died
in his sleep on December 21st at 5:50 P.M.30
The fact that Patton alone of all the victims of the
automobile accident suffered serious injuries, plus the lack of his
recovery and then sudden decline in a military hospital, have fueled
various conspiracy theories. One of these, that Patton knew of the Soviet
shooting of American, Canadian, and British prisoners of war and threatened
to expose the Allied knowledge and cover-up of the affair, was revealed
by a Ukrainian defector with close ties to the Soviet KGB, who alleged
that Patton's accident was no accident, and that the KGB had been behind
it. Another version is similar, but has the OSS or other Allied entity
performing the "accident" and subsequent "medical complications."
If there is any truth in the idea of a conspiracy behind
the ironic death of America's most decorated and celebrated general
officer of the Second World War, then the explanation is likely to lie
in the more esoteric and arcane secrets he and his intelligence officers
uncovered in Thuringia and at the Skoda Works in Pilsen. Having performed
a preliminary assessment of the second and third generation weaponry
Kammler's scientists had begun to research, the OSS specialists who
arrived at these sites must have immediately realized the material would
require the tightest security and highest classification then possible,
beyond that even of the Manhattan Project, not least because what was
uncovered would give lie to the emerging Allied Legend of nuclear technological
superiority. Patton was a potential threat to the security of this operation and a risk to the continued secret American
development of Kammler's technology in conjunction with
Operation Paperclip.31
31 It is significant in this respect
that Mayer and Mehner report in Das Geheimnis(p. 187), that all of the
documents of Patton's troops in Ohrdruf are still sealed and classified.
If there is truth to the conspiracy theories of Patton's
incongruous death, then of all the theories, this would seem to be the
most plausible motivation and explanation for the murder of America's
famous general.
Patton, and his famous mouth, had to be silenced.
D. The Kammler SS Sonderkommando Secret Weapons
Empire
Were the secrets of Kammler's SS empire worth changing
the entire Allied operational plan at the end of the war, and were they
worth the possible deliberate assassination of one of the war's most
famous generals?
"Pilsen and the Skoda Works were captured by Combat
Command B, Third Armored Division, the same unit that captured Kammler's
unique metropolis, with its treasure-trove of missiles and jet engines,
at Nordhausen in Saxony on April 11."32
Suspiciously,
Agoston's Freedom of Information Act request for the war diaries of
Patton's armored units that captured the SS facilities in Pilsen and
Prague could not be located in he US National Archives.33
However, Agoston presents evidence that Allied intelligence,
at least from the British point of view, had little to no knowledge
of the Kammler Group. British Lieutenant Colonel James Brierley, commanding
the first British intelligence group to arrive in Pilsen after its capture,
stated that the Skoda plant workers and engineers themselves reported
that everything was microfilmed, that the buildings which housed their
blueprints and development projects had been demolished, and also that
the files had been stored outside Pilsen.34

Destroyed by whom? And stored outside Pilsen by whom?
Presumably by the SS itself. It is perhaps pertinent to this idea that
many of the reports of Kammler's death place him in the area, not to
die, but to remove the most sensitive data and to vouchsafe it for security.
At this point it is necessary to say something about
Agoston's own thesis concerning the disappearance of the Kammler Staff's
files. The whole thesis of Agoston's book is obvious from its title,
i.e., that in the confusion of the transfer of the Skoda Works from
American to Russian military occupation, the Kammler Group's entire
secret inventory was handed over to the Soviet Union. This much is recounted to
Agoston by Voss. However, if Kammler had previously removed, or even duplicated,
the most sensitive items, blueprints, and papers
and secreted them somewhere, as would seem to
be indicated by the Czech reports to British intelligence, then it is
likely that all the Soviets received were the table scraps. Kammler
had previously removed the most sensitive items, and Patton's men, and
presumably the OSS, would have thoroughly scoured
the remaining material.
Another possibility thus emerges in the "conspiracy"
view of Patton's death. Could he have been assassinated because he himself
was the point man to bring Kammler and his secrets and technicians and
scientists into the emerging Operation Paperclip? While we will probably
never know for sure, it is interesting to note that when Dr. Voss gave
"the full story of the secrets leakage at Pilsen and Kammler's
disappearance to US Intelligence in West Germany," he was informed
"at the highest level to keep the matter under wraps, along with
the briefings he than gave US Intelligence of he areas covered by the SS research at Pilsen."35
Who was it that debriefed Voss for US military intelligence? None other
than fellow general office r Lieutenant General Lucius D. Clay, a man
well known to Patton.36
What happened to Dr. Voss after the war?
Perhaps not
unusually, he became involved in a joint CIA-West German BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst,
West Germany's version of the CIA) effort to build armaments plants
for Egypt's Gamel Abdul Nasser, and to train its army. Voss became the
overall coordinator of an effort to supply Egypt with former Wehrmacht
officers and the latest in missile technology. Also involved was former
Reichsbank president Hjalmar Schact, father-in-law to famous SS commando,
and later coordinator of the notorious ODESSA (Organization der Ehemalige
SS Angehdriger or Organization of Former SS Members), Otto Skorzeny.37
35 Agoston, op. cit.,
p. 94. Agoston notes that this secrecy order to Voss kept
him from disclosing the story until after Voss' death.

37 Ibid., pp. 116-118.
This effort was part of a much broader postwar effort on the part of
the West German government to expand its markets for high technology military
equipment to the Arab-Muslim world, a drive that has continuing political
repercussions down to our own day. There is more than meets the eye
in this postwar SS-Arab connection, that will be explored further in
the subsequent parts of this book.
In any case, taken together the picture of the postwar
behavior and associations of Dr. Wilhelm Voss, the multiple "deaths"
of Obergruppenfuhrer Kammler, his more likely disappearance into you
another black programs empire, and the ironic if not suspicious death
of General George Patton are further corroboration that the Nazi Reich
was up to far more than V-1s and V-2s.
It was in the possession of prototypical
technologies and military capabilities of such extreme power and sophistication
that many of these secrets remain classified. Before we can examine
what these secrets might be and the type of physics that they imply,
we must, however, take a detour to the other Axis power seeking its
own path to the atom bomb on the other side of the world.
