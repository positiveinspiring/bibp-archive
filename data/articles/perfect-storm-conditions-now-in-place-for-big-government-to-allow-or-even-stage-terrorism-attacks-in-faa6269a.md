Propaganda is in full swing at
the highest levels of government this weekend with the 9/11
tenth anniversary "celebrations" and the DHS fear campaign
that tells all Americans to "be afraid" that now white
terrorists are the real threat. (Bizarre...)
"If you see something, say something" is the new
spy-on-your-neighbor mantra in America, and most of those
propaganda ads feature everyday white people staging terror
attacks.
Signs that white people might be terrorists - if
you believe Napolitano's propaganda - include using a cell
phone or taking notes. Yeah, 'cuz talking on a cell phone is
a sure sign you're plotting against the government, I guess.
In response to all this nonsense, today on this 9/11 tenth
anniversary weekend I've posted a special story that goes
into great detail of how and why the U.S. government is
right now planning to either exploit or even execute its own
terror attack on U.S. soil in order to further its agenda of
taking away our freedoms which was begun under
George W.
Bush.
The Patriot Act, it seems, wasn't enough. Too many
freedoms still remain and now even those must be crushed
under the Department of Homeland Security's campaign of
total fear.
This is an urgent message that departs from our usual health freedom focus.
Please do not continue reading this story if
you would rather not deal with the reality of what governments throughout
history have routinely done when they wanted to seize more power from
citizens or expand their power. That governments do this is not even
debated, by the way. It's all open source and well documented throughout the
history of the world (see sources below).
This is not fiction, nor conspiracy theory. It is historical fact, and I'm
warning readers right now because conditions seem ripe for
history to repeat itself with a new engineered war, a national emergency or
some sort of false flag attack by government against its own people.
Also, I want to preface all this by being clear that there are GOOD people
who work in government. There are good FBI agents, good ATF agents and good
local cops who really do serve the interests of the public. In fact, I would
say that most law enforcement officials in the USA are working for good and
do their best to operate with a sense of ethics and common sense.
What I'm discussing below only represents the
bad few who openly engage in corruption and planned destructive events.
Sadly, these kind of evil people exist in every industry and every
profession. They exist today inside the FBI, inside the ATF, and inside
local police departments, and they are an embarrassment to the rest of the
good "men and women in blue" who actually work to protect our streets from
criminals.
So please understand that this article is not an attack on law enforcement.
It is an attack on those few corrupt, evil
individuals inside law enforcement (at every level) who actively violate our
nation's laws and plot against the American people in order to gain money,
power and control.
Government terror =
instant popularity
As former President
George W. Bush found out, attacking America is the
quickest way to raise the popularity of the President. In the aftermath of
9/11, Bush's popularity soared beyond 70% and gave him the political
momentum to pass almost any law he desired.
Out of that fiasco came the Patriot Act, one of
the most dangerous freedom-crushing laws in U.S. history - a law which guts
the Bill of Rights and is now used against animal rights protestors and
other non-terrorist groups, by the way.
Today, Obama's popularity is plummeting, even among Democrats. Popularity
polls put Obama at record lows. It is at moments like this - when presidents
are seeing their popularity plummet - that they often turn to "fabricated
emergencies" or so-called "false flag attacks"
in order to rally the people behind them.
For those who don't know, false flag terror attacks have admittedly been
part of the U.S. government's game plan for the last several decades.
Operation Northwoods, whose documents have now been made public, revealed
that the U.S. plotted to stage attacks on U.S. cities in order to blame
Fidel Castro and justify an invasion of Cuba.
This is
historical fact, not conspiracy theory.
So don't let anyone tell you this is all just
some bizarre conspiracy theory. This was the official strategic playbook at
the highest levels of government. It is conspiracy fact.
In other words, the U.S. government was, itself, willing to kill innocent
Americans in order to garner public support for a war against Cuba.
One of the targeted cities of this operation was
Miami, which would have suffered countless civilian casualties under this
plan. This was all laid out by the Department of Defense and the Joint
Chiefs of Staff in a document entitled, "Justification
for US Military Intervention in Cuba (TS)."
As journalist James Bamford described it,
"Operation Northwoods, which had the written
approval of the Chairman and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
called for innocent people to be shot on American streets; for boats
carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave
of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington, D.C., Miami, and
elsewhere.
People would be framed for bombings they did
not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using phony evidence, all of it
would be blamed on Castro, thus giving Lemnitzer and his cabal the
excuse, as well as the public and international backing, they needed to
launch their war."
Government will do
anything to stay in power
Did you catch that? The U.S. government plotted to commit acts of terrorism
against innocent Americans simply to justify its war on Castro.
False flag attacks are routinely used by government around the world as
pretexts for war. They're also
quite handy at boosting the popularity of the President.
Slumping in the polls? Stage a shooting! Or better yet, drop a dirty bomb
into the water supply and poison an entire city.
In the aftermath of that
terror, the American sheeple will go along with just about anything,
including military troops on the streets, even in total violation of
Posse Comitatus which prohibits the
military form engaging in law enforcement actions on U.S. soil.
Napolitano spreads the
fear to prepare the people for false flag attacks
Janet Napolitano, the most prolific propagandizer of fear at
DHS, has been
busy lately warning people about impeding terrorist attacks around the 9/11
ten-year anniversary.
What she's not telling you, of course, is that
the U.S. government itself is the group that's likely organizing these
attacks for its own political purposes. Having a terrorist group take over a
nuclear power plant on 9/11 would remind Americans to "be afraid" and
surrender to government authority in order to feel a little safer.
It's classic problem-reaction-solution.
But getting back to the "perfect storm" I mentioned earlier, we now have
four factors lining up to support a U.S. government false flag operation:
-
Obama's plummeting ratings in the polls.
A new terror attack or war is needed to rally the people around the
President and save his political career.
-
The impeding total default on the U.S.
debt. What better way to distract people from the reality of
financial implosion than to set off a few explosions (or dirty
bombs) around the country and blame it on terrorists?
Violence which can be blamed on others
is always a rallying tactic for governments to engineer loyalty
among the people. Watch for the U.S. government to stage an act of
violence and blame it on Ron Paul supporters, veterans or people who
own gold and firearms.
-
The need to keep the people in line.
Today, people are starting to question authority. They're fed up
with the TSA. They're engaged in an online groundswell of
disobedience toward Washington.
The way to silence all these people and
portray anti-government speech as "acts of terrorism" is to blow
something up and, ideally, blame it on white American extremists.
The DHS is already preparing the nation
for this with propaganda ads that depict everyday
white people as terrorists.
-
As a Big Government bonus, they can also
go after all the gun owners who really represent the last line of
resistance against government tyranny.
This was the whole point behind
Operation Fast & Furious, in which the U.S. government has now been
caught actually selling thousands of weapons to Mexican drug gangs,
in the hopes that those weapons would then be used in violent
criminal acts back in the USA. In reaction to this new wave of "gun
violence," the government could call for a new ban on all gun
ownership - and such an act has always been a prelude to total
government tyranny against its own people.
(Hitler confiscated all guns right
before launching his genocidal attacks on the Jews. It's always
easier to commit genocide if the innocents don't shoot back...)
These are the big four reasons why we can expect
to witness a false flag attack here in America sometime in the next six
months.
My Spidey sense tells me this is coming sooner
rather than later.
I am concerned that such an engineered attack is
right now being drawn up and implemented by some dark, rogue group of
government operatives who are treasonous in their intentions, and that in
the aftermath of it all, we will almost certainly lose even more rights and
freedoms, just as we did in the aftermath of 9/11.
Predictions for the
next false-flag terror attack in America
Watch for an attack to happen on a Monday or Tuesday because that maximizes
the news cycle for the week.
When government announces something that it
doesn't want people to know about, it always announces them late on Friday,
because most people are distracted with getting off work early and headed
out for the weekend.
Tuesday is the ideal day to stage a false flag attack because it catches
people at work and gives the event four days of mainstream news coverage
which is, of course, completely engineered from false government propaganda.
9/11 took place, of course, on a Tuesday.
What will the next false-flag terror attack in America look like?
My guess
is that they now want to portray white people as the terrorists, so they
need another Timothy McVeigh patsy to play the part. They've probably been
out recruiting disgruntled veterans for this specific purpose, using all
sorts of CIA mind control tactics (and technologies) to put voices into
someone's head and convince them that God wants them to unleash a dirty bomb
in New York City or something.
Yes, the technology to project voices into someone's head has existed for
years. It's a
DARPA research project called
the "Sonic Projector,"
and WIRED News reported on it back in 2007.
This same technology is also being developed as a new marketing
communications system that can "beam" specific marketing messages right into
the heads of people who pass by a storefront, for example.
It's called
HyperSonic Sound.
Likely targets
The most likely targets in America for these false flag attacks are ones
that have lots of visuals that can be shown on the evening news again and
again so that they can burn the fear into the eyeballs of the American sheeple.
The bloodier it all is, the better in the eyes
of the government conspirators because blood and gore creates fear that can
be harnessed to pass yet more freedom-crushing legislation (or just put
military troops right on the streets).
So the government needs something
that has a strong visual element, such as a blown up building, or blown up
bodies, or loads and loads of people getting sick and dying from radiation
unleashed from a dirty bomb, for example.
That's why the following possible false flag terror scenarios seem the most
likely to be invoked:
-
Blowing up trains carrying either
nuclear materials or extremely dangerous chemicals, probably near a
large population area in order to cause mass casualties.
-
Setting off a dirty bomb in a major U.S.
city, causing widespread radiation poisoning of millions.
-
Unleashing deadly poisons in the water
supply (although I don't think this is the most likely one because
it doesn't have strong visuals like things blowing up).
-
A mass shooting massacre at a sporting
event or shopping mall. This one has the psychological advantage of
also calling for national gun confiscation.
-
Taking over and exploding an oil
refinery. They will wait for all the TV cameras to arrive before
setting off the explosions, of course.
-
I also think there is a slight chance
that the government will try to use a disgruntled farmer as the
patsy, rigging up some sort of explosion using large volumes of
fertilizer and a white farmer wielding a firearm. This would be a
way to attack food freedoms by portraying farmers as terrorists.
A farmer could easily target a federal
building (a la Oklahoma City), and the explosion would help spread
fear and instill even more government authority over farms and food
production. This would play right into the hands of the FDA which
already wants more control over the food supply.
What better way to accomplish that than
to portray farmers as terrorists?
No matter what the targets, you can best that
freedom will be blamed in all this, and the reporting by the mainstream
media will be twisted to condemn anyone who buys gold, questions
the Federal
Reserve, supports Ron Paul or believes in the U.S. Constitution (gasp!).
The whole point of these operations it to paint
patriots as terrorists and thereby convince the rest of the sheeple in the
country to strip away whatever remaining rights and protections free people
might expect to enjoy.
How does the
government get patsies to pull this stuff off?
You might sensibly wonder how the government gets people like Timothy
McVeigh or Lee Harvey Oswald (Kennedy assassination) to play these roles of
patsies? Or the Saudi air passengers on 9/11, for that matter...
The answer is simple:
Undercover FBI and CIA agents find people who are
disgruntled and a little whacky.
Then they convince them (or literally
"program" them) to take action against the government and actually provide
them with the materials, logistics and know-how they need to pull off the
operations.
This is why we saw government agents helping the
infamous "underwear bomber" board an airplane even though he didn't have
identification.
The FBI has also admittedly been caught
trying to arm a terrorist in Portland with a "fake bomb".
As Paul Craig Robert, a former member of the Reagan administration, wrote
about this incident:
Why does the FBI orchestrate fake "terror
plots"? The latest one snared Osman Mohamud, a Somali-American teenager
in Portland, Ore. The Associated Press report is headlined: "Somali-born
teen plotted car-bombing in Oregon."
This is a misleading headline as the report
makes it clear that it was a plot orchestrated by federal agents. Two
sentences into the news report we have this:
"The bomb was an elaborate fake supplied by
the [FBI] agents and the public was never in danger, authorities said."
The teenager was supplied with a fake bomb and a
fake detonator.
The FBI's staging of "fake terror" in Portland resulted in a mass of angry
citizens
storming the Portland city hall to protest.
As PrisonPlanet reports:
Indeed, as previously reported, the FBI
itself seems to pose the greatest threat as it sneaks around
constructing and detonating bombs, allowing an inert device to be
delivered next to a public crowd of thousands, all resulting in a
high-profile arrest leaving the Mayor of Portland looking humiliatingly
ignorant.
This is an agency with an agenda, not an
agency performing its duties. Portland's Mayor Sam Adams should be
thankful the FBI didn't decide to go with real explosives as they did in
the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in order to make their point and
expand Federal control over the American people.
You can bet that right now, the FBI and CIA are
running around America trying to recruit disgruntled crazies to carry out
"terror attacks" on U.S. soil.
And DHS is using its bullhorn to spread stories
that the next terror attack will come from
white American terrorists.
(Meanwhile, hilariously, the leader of the
Libyan rebels who have been strongly aided by the U.S. and the U.N.
is
admittedly an al-Qaida operative, once again proving that the U.S.
government openly funds terrorists.)
Why is all this really being done? From the FBI's point of view, it's all
about job security. It's the same story with the ATF and its gun running
into Mexico (operation Fast & Furious).
The TSA is also looking to shore up its own job security, which is probably
why the agency was caught running its own
airport bomb practice scenarios without even notifying airport
police (because it's all a secret, you see).
In reality, nearly every government agency is right now thinking really hard
about how to run its own false flag operations that will support its own
expansion of power. The FDA loves to see food borne illness kill a few dozen
people; the DEA loves to see drug gang violence breaking out in U.S. cities;
and the DHS gets absolutely ecstatic when more terror attacks happen on U.S.
soil.
For these rogue agencies, it's all about their
own survival, and they will do anything to make sure they keep getting
funding.
We already showed film footage (below video) proving how the CDC
fabricated false information about AIDS in order to shore up its own funding:
This is the same agency that
spread
fear and terror about H5N1 swine flu in
order to help its drug company buddies make more money off the fear.
This is how government operates, folks: It incessantly seeks to expand its
power and authority at any cost. Big Government is like a cancer - it just
keeps spreading, creating larger and larger tumors until it finally kills
the host. And in America today,
Big Government is suffocating freedom,
destroying our economy and driving America down a path of financial
destruction.
Just today,
Donald Rumsfeld threatened
that if defense funding was cut to the Pentagon, America would suffer
another terrorist attack.
This is all being done by design, of course.
-
Why else would the feds raid Gibson
Guitars at gunpoint and order them to export their jobs overseas by
claiming it is illegal for American workers to
"work
the wood" used to make guitars?
-
Why else would Obama's health care reform contain provisions that seem
specifically designed to crush medium-sized businesses and drive more jobs
out of the country?
-
Why else would the new Food Safety Modernization
Act actually expand the funding of the FDA, a bona fide government
terrorist organization that operates a network of
spies and infiltrators who run
around the country intimidating raw milk ranchers and threatening to
murder their animal herds?
You've got to take off the blinders, folks, and realize that all these
individual actions of government tyranny and intimidation make up the puzzle
pieces of a much larger picture.
And that picture clearly depicts the U.S.
government as something that has long forgotten any sense of serving the
People through civic duty and, instead, now views itself as the controller
of the people.
Government today views itself as the police
state authority over every detail of citizens' lives.
As a great example of that which just surfaced, a Good Samaritan citizen who
stepped in to help direct traffic after a traffic light went out was just
arrested by the cops and given a ticket.
Meanwhile, the cops refused to direct traffic at all, letting the traffic
back up for at least a mile.
The mere act of trying to help society now gets you arrested, imprisoned or
ticketed in America. And don't even try to question the authority of cops,
or you'll be tasered and beaten.
The government of America has become the very same freedom-crushing
monstrosity our founding father warned us about, and it actively seeks to
use acts of government-run domestic terrorism to keep the American people in
line. This is the reality of the government we live under today, and it's
not going to get any better until we wise up and take back our freedoms to
prevent violence from being committed by our government against our own
citizens.
For the record, I do not espouse the use of violence to resolve conflicts,
and I have consistently urged readers to support non-violent
activism to take back our freedoms, throw the scoundrels out of office,
peacefully march in protest of bad policies and so on. The radical
government always tries to paint patriots and constitutional scholars as
"terrorists" who advocate violence, but in reality it is the
constitutionalists who are trying to prevent violence by restoring the
Republic that America once was.
A Republic, you probably already know, is a
nation that exists under the rule of law, where those laws apply equally to
everyone, including members of government.
And yet today, our own government operatives utterly disregard law, dismiss
the Constitution and even knowingly violate laws in their quest for more
power and control.
Forcing government to follow the law is a very,
very difficult thing to accomplish as has been shown throughout human
history:
A Republic, if you can
keep it
The deliberations of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 were held in
strict secrecy.
Consequently, anxious citizens gathered outside
Independence Hall when the proceedings ended in order to learn what had been
produced behind closed doors. The answer was provided immediately.
A Mrs.
Powel of Philadelphia asked Benjamin Franklin, "Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic
or a monarchy?" With no hesitation whatsoever, Franklin
responded, "A republic, if you can keep it."
http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/659-qa-republic-if-you-can-keep-itq
But we have failed to keep it, sadly.
America has devolved into a land of
government
lawlessness where even the Bill of Rights is routinely and
willfully violated. Government has become arrogant, punitive and
controlling. Citizens are arrested and threatened with life in prison for
merely videotaping cops in a public place!
This is not a government "of the People, by the People and for the People."
It has grown into a monstrosity of government for government's sake, and
DAMN the People!
This is why you can expect the next so-called "terrorism" attacks in America
to be planned and executed by government itself. Now that law has been
abandoned, terror is the one remaining tactic they can use to keep the sheeple in line.
George Bush used it quite effectively to
partially dismantle the Bill of Rights, and now
Obama will continue the work
of
George Bush
just as he's done with,
-
secret prisons
-
illegal wars
-
economic
destruction
-
empty rhetoric,
...that only distracts the American people from
the reality of what's being done to us.
Heck, Obama has now resorted to using techniques of
neurolingistic
programming to embed action-command language in his speeches.
Check out this 45-second remix video.
Stay safe out there. The situation is far worse than you've been led to
believe, and your own government is actively plotting against you to
maintain its power and domination over the populace.
This weekend's "celebration" of 9/11 is really
the government celebrating its own success at using staged 9/11 events to
take away your freedoms and grow its own power.
