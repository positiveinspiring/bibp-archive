GATEKEEPER ALTERS
The Gatekeeper alters are just that. They
protect the gates or portals to all System levels. Infrequently, the
programmers may also call them doorkeepers, or tollmen & toll
women. The victim may refer to them as guards or blockers, although
Gatekeepers are more than guards, they are an entrance or portal to
something. Gatekeepers may often be the alter that was split to get a
particular section. Each gatekeeper may be at a deeper level trance than
the one before it. When a Gatekeeper is split it creates a natural link
to the alters that are created from itself. Then the Gatekeepers are
given programming not to see what they have created
