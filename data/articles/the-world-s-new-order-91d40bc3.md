This article is going to be quite different in format since it will contain more videos than my comments so as to try to tie together and express more than I ever could write in one submission.
The theme that runs through all is to dramatize how humans are unknowingly being subjugated at every level and most aspects and phases of life, living and the pursuit of higher consciousness. It's an attempt on my part to connect some dots that, when considered side-by-side, may prompt readers to think about what's going on to implement what I, and many others, expect is "corporate-acracy" or fascism:
A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, a capitalist economy subject to stringent governmental controls, violent suppression of the opposition, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism A political philosophy or movement based on or advocating such a system of government. [1]

The perfect place to start is with the TPP - Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.
The TPP - What You're Not Being Told
Readers, can you wrap your minds around 600 corporate representatives being able to read the TPP agreement but the public, whom will be affected the most, cannot know what's in it?
Even Congress can't see it! Whoa!
Doesn't that sound like the shenanigans that went on to pass the Affordable Care Act aka ObamaCare?
That kind of BSing regarding transparency has to stop!
Jade Helm 15 - 10 States Now Involved with Massive US Military Exercises
Source That "Truth and Action" reporting on JH15 is "mammoth" in size, scope, and videos!
Readers will see video after video of military armored vehicles, etc. moving across the USA - but for what reason? With whom is the U.S. military going to war in 10 U.S. states?
Moving all that equipment and personnel, including vehicles marked "UN" around the USA definitely should awaken any skeptic to a "New World Order" of governance apparently coming to the USA!
Are Readers Aware of FEMA camps?
More state-by-state information about FEMA camps.
Mandatory Vaccination Laws Being Forced
...Upon and Against Individual Sovereignty of One's Body and Children (SB277 in California)
Finally and thankfully, African-Americans are awakening to what's happened, and is happening, to them including medical experiments, e.g., the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, and they will be taking action! Here's a video news report (WHDT) about what has the African-American community so upset about the CDC/FDA and vaccines...
The U.S. CDC Lies about Its Affiliation with Big Pharma and Big Pharma's Apparent Influence
Source The British Medical Journal (BMJ) published a compelling article about the U.S. CDC's receiving funding from industry (Big Pharma) after Jeanne Lenzer, a BMJ journalist, looked into the money part that's behind the CDC's infamous statement,
"CDC, our planners, and our content experts wish to disclose they have no financial interests or other relationships with the manufacturers of commercial products... CDC does not accept commercial support."
According to Lenzer,
"Despite the agency's disclaimer, the CDC does receive millions of dollars in industry gifts and funding, both directly and indirectly, and several recent CDC actions and recommendations have raised questions about the science it cites, the clinical guidelines it promotes, and the money it is taking." [2]
Furthermore, The Washington Post reported that "Pharmaceutical firms paid to attend meetings of panel that advises FDA, emails show."
Therein is a HUGE indication of corporate influence over government agencies, which definitely should not be.
GMO 'Phood' and its Problems - One picture is worth a thousand words! The question everyone in science ought to ask is this:
Didn't Dr. Seralini's study use the same strain of rats as Monsanto used in its study to prove GMOs 'safe'?
However, Gilles-Eric Seralini's study went on for two years, whereas Monsanto's study lasted for only three months! Jerry Rosman, formerly a GMO crop farmer turned organic farming consultant, claims the FDA is not concerned about GMOs!
What's Happening to the Air We Breathe? Look at the sky above for an impressively visible clue. It's called weather geoengineering.
Here are some videos about that:
Here's an article which may explain more about climate control. If you're a frequent flyer, perhaps, you'd better know about aerotoxic air syndrome. Watch the below video embedded in "Climate Engineering Contamination And Aerotoxic Air Syndrome":
Gerald Celente of The Trends Journal wraps up much of what's going on globally better than anyone, I think, has for the last 30 or so years. Very few people, in my opinion, have the insights, passion and "stage presence" quite like Gerald Celente!

Need I mention that my computer also is being compromised; files go missing; and my Norton 'security' program freezes my computer when I try accessing ActivistPost.com for whom I write, plus research files!
Who's to Blame? So really,
Why are humans, our sovereign rights given by Creator and Nature, and the intricacies of our daily lives being overtaken by Big Brother governments? Is there a possibility that we, collectively, are to blame? How can I make such a comment that probably indicates we are allowing these indiscretions to come down upon us almost like biblical plagues?

Well, this video "The Zombification of the Planet" explains some, but this one reaches into the secrecy of the elites' and controllers' strategy meetings. However, nothing can compare with the Bohemian Grove meetings in Northern California where clandestine meetings with 'elites' from all walks of life take place.
This below video shows some of the arcane trappings of Bohemian Grove:
The BG crowd in the past included politicians who were BG participants before they became U.S. presidents!
See my article, "Presidential Candidates Apparent Vetting Process" to understand just how pervasive apparent dysfunctionality is in the so-called elites. One of the events at the BG annual encampment is "The Cremation of Care."
Here is a video of the actual onsite druid-like ritual filmed by InfoWars.
Are they really paying homage to the Owl of Bohemia in a sacrificial way?
What would you think of your member of government, or any corporate elite, who participates in such rituals? Can those rituals be compared with witchcraft, black magic or as some speculate, Satanism, which actually is a 'religion' of sordid sorts? Furthermore, are the men who participate at BG - no women allowed - the very same 'sickos' who mandate how we are to live; promote wars our spouses, relatives, children and friends are sent to fight; and constantly are formulating treaties and laws for a one-world-government?

Citizens of the USA need to wake up to what's going on and become engaged in civics, something not taught in schools anymore.
I wonder why...
