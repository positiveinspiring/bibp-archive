President Obama's comments on Wednesday in a
joint press conference with Chinese President Hu Jintao, misinformed the
public about potential changes in foreign exchange rates and their effects
on U.S. citizens.
Obama on Wednesday said that he would like to
see the Chinese Yuan appreciate faster in value.
While Hu indicated that
China is committed to allowing the free market to better dictate the value
of the Yuan, Obama said China is implementing their steps to allow the Yuan
to appreciate "not as fast as we'd like."
For years, the U.S. has been criticizing China by calling them "currency
manipulators". The fact is, the
Federal Reserve
is the real currency
manipulator because their actions will soon lead to a U.S. Hyperinflationary
Great Depression that destroys the lives of all Americans who aren't
prepared for life with a worthless U.S. dollar.
All China is doing is
pegging the Yuan to the U.S. dollar so that their product manufacturers and
exporters can maintain some level of stability. However, the U.S. is using
this as an excuse to explain its rapidly deteriorating export market.
Obama was correct when he explained to the world how China would benefit by
having a stronger Yuan. Obama understands perfectly how a stronger Yuan
would bring down prices for Chinese citizens and allow them to enjoy a much
higher standard of living.
In fact,
NIA believes China could solve their
current inflation crisis simply by allowing the Yuan to appreciate alone.
China has seen the prices of many food items soar by 25% or more in recent
months, which is horrific for a country where many of its citizens spend
half of their income on food. While most mainstream economists on CNBC,
Bloomberg, and FOX Business are quick to blame China's food inflation crisis
on the weather, NIA believes the weather has very little to do with it.
It
seems like the weather is always the excuse every time food prices rise.
Mainstream economists would have you believe that the world has been
experiencing never-ending droughts and floods that continue to worsen each
year.
NIA members know better than that. After all, we have the most educated
membership base in the world. The truth is, China's food inflation crisis is
coming as a direct result of the Federal Reserve's
destructive quantitative
easing and money printing policies, and China's willingness to keep the U.S.
dollar artificially propped up out of fear that Americans will no longer be
able to afford their exports.
China is importing all of its food inflation
from the U.S. and if President Obama gets his way, China will throw its food
inflation right back into the faces of all U.S. citizens.
Imagine a food fight in school between American and Chinese kids with the
American kids throwing their free National School Lunch Program (NSLP) meals
(paid for by Chinese purchases of U.S. treasuries) at the Chinese kids while
the Chinese kids sit there ignoring it trying to enjoy their own meals that
they spent half of their income to buy.
All the while, the American kids are
antagonizing the Chinese kids, calling them currency manipulators and
blaming their need for free NSLP lunches on China's currency peg (when the
peg is actually preventing the American kids from starving).
Sooner or
later, not only will the Chinese kids throw the NSLP lunch remains back at
the Americans, but they might become so disgusted (because they paid for the
food being thrown at them) that they actually regurgitate their meals that
they worked half of the day to be able to consume, into the American kids'
faces.
If the Federal Reserve continues down the path it is currently on, not only
will China allow the Yuan to rise to a free market determined level, which
will send China's food inflation crisis back to the U.S., but China is
likely to dump their U.S. treasury holdings that they are currently
hoarding.
China's foreign exchange reserves rose by $199 billion last
quarter (its largest quarterly gain in 15 years and 78% higher than analyst
estimates of $112 billion) to a record $2.85 trillion for total growth in
2010 of 18.7%.
Most likely, about 2/3 of these reserves are in U.S. dollars.
Americans have been deceived by the U.S. government and the mainstream media
into believing the U.S. economy is recovering, because the U.S. has been
enjoying the benefits of inflation without the consequences of rising
prices. When the U.S. bond bubble begins to burst and these trillions of
dollars being hoarded come home to roost, inflation will become the primary
concern of all Americans.
NIA finds it completely outrageous how Obama can be so honest with Chinese
citizens about their benefits of having a stronger Yuan, but then seconds
later outright lies to the American public by saying that Americans would
gain by having a stronger Yuan as well. A stronger Yuan by definition would
mean a weaker U.S. dollar.
It is insane for Obama to proclaim that having a
stronger currency is good for China but bad for America. The rules of
economics are the same in both countries.
As the Chinese see their purchasing power increase by having a stronger Yuan,
Americans will see their purchasing power decrease by having a weaker
dollar.
These simple economic principles are easy for any human being to
understand, but nobody in the mainstream media is calling Obama out on it.
The media completely accepts Obama's statements as the truth, without
providing any warning to American citizens that Obama's desired change in
foreign exchange rates will shift China's inflation crisis completely to the
U.S.
On November 12th, NIA's President Gerard Adams warned Americans on FOX
Business to beware of
massive food inflation in early 2011.
We are less than
three weeks into the new year and massive food inflation is already here.
SuperValu, the third-largest U.S. food retailer with 2,349 stores that
operate under such names as Acme, Albertsons, and Save-A-Lot, just reported
that all of their major vendors have announced their intentions to pass
along rising costs throughout the calendar year and the company will be
raising prices on all food items by 3% to 14%.
NIA's experience tells us
that SuperValu is planning to increase prices on most goods by approximately
14%. Trust us, if SuperValu was expecting to increase prices by an average
of only around 5%, they would have given an average instead of such a wide
range.
(By the way, SuperValu's stock crashed 16% on the news and one of
NIA's top 10 predictions for 2011 was that U.S. retail stocks will decline
after reporting lower profit margins.)
The SuperValu situation confirms that double-digit U.S. food price inflation
is just about guaranteed to occur in 2011. We also expect to see
double-digit price inflation this year in clothing, oil, gasoline, natural
gas, and all of the most important things Americans need to live and
survive.
If the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) somehow manages to
report a CPI increase in 2011 of anything less than 5%, and the mainstream
media continues to report the BLS's CPI numbers as the truth, any Americans
who continue to listen to
the mainstream media deserve to lose all of their
purchasing power during hyperinflation.
