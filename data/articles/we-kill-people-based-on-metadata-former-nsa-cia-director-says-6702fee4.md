At a recent debate concerning the National
Security Agency's bulk surveillance programs, former
NSA
and CIA
director Michael Hayden admitted that metadata is used as the basis
for killing people.
The comments were made during a debate at Johns
Hopkins University, after Georgetown University Law Center professor
David Cole detailed the kind of information the government can obtain
simply by collecting metadata - who you call, when you call them, how long
the call lasts, and how often calls between the two parties are made.
Although NSA supporters often claim such
metadata collection is permissible considering the content of the call is
not collected, Cole argued that is not the case, since the former general
counsel of the NSA, Stewart Baker, has already stated metadata alone
is more than enough to reveal vast amounts of an individual's personal
information
Writing in the New York Review
of Books, Cole elaborated (you can also watch his explanation around the
14 minute mark of the below video):
"Of
course knowing the content of a call can be crucial to establishing a
particular threat.
But
metadata alone can provide an extremely detailed picture of a person's
most intimate associations and interests, and it's actually much easier
as a technological matter to search huge amounts of metadata than to
listen to millions of phone calls.
As NSA
General Counsel Stewart Baker has said,
'metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody's life. If
you have enough metadata, you don't really need content.'
"When I
quoted Baker at a recent debate at Johns Hopkins University, my
opponent, General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and the
CIA, called Baker's comment 'absolutely correct,' and raised him one,
asserting, 'We kill people based on metadata'."
Hayden paused after making this statement -
around the 18 minute mark of the video - and then qualified it by adding,
"but that's
not what we do with this metadata."
Presumably, when Hayden emphasizes
"this metadata," he is referring to the
information collected from American citizens.
As RT
reported in February, the US is already
using metadata to select targets for drone strikes around the world.
In a report for the Intercept, an unnamed drone
operator - backed up by documents leaked by
Edward Snowden - said the agency
analyzes metadata as well as mobile-tracking technology to determine
targets, without employing human intelligence to confirm a suspect's
identity.

"People
get hung up that there's a targeted list of people,"
the operator said.
"It's really
like we're targeting a cell phone. We're not going after people - we're
going after their phones, in the hopes that the person on the other end
of that missile is the bad guy."
According to Cole, the realization that the NSA
is collecting such vast amounts of information has prompted action from both
Democrats and Republicans in Washington.
Last week, two committees in the House of
Representatives recently voted unanimously to support the USA Freedom Act,
which would bar the NSA from collecting metadata in bulk. The data would
remain in the possession of telecommunications companies, only to be
accessed by the government if it can prove reasonable suspicion to the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
As noted by Cole, however, the bill doesn't
address all the facets of the NSA's surveillance program.
As its currently written, the Freedom Act only
applies to American citizens, not foreigners who are also under
surveillance, nor does it address what he termed the NSA's,
"guerilla-like tactics of inserting
vulnerabilities into computer software and drivers, to be exploited
later to surreptitiously intercept private communications."
As RT
reported previously, the NSA designed at least two encryption tools
offered by the security firm RSA - one of which was made the default option,
and which allowed the NSA to easily infiltrate computer security systems.
