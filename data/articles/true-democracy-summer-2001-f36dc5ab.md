Defense Industry Security Command (DISCO)
Dr. Boylan states that this agency "conducts intelligence operations
within and on behalf of the civilian defense contracor corporations engaged
in classified research, development, and production."
Why should tax payer dollars be used to protect corporations? And why should
all this be classified? If the corporations want privacy, let them hire it
themselves. The tax payers deserve to have their taxes spent on productive
measures, not on classified research. That is not conducive to democracy.
