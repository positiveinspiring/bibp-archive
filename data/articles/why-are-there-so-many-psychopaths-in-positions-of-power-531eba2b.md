# Why Are There so Many Psychopaths in Positions of Power?

A 2010 study (Corporate
Psychopathy - Talking the Walk) that examined a
sample of 203 individuals from different companies' management
development programs revealed something interesting.
It was found that about 3% of
business managers scored in the psychopath range while the
incidence of psychopathy in the general population is
approximately 1%.
So why are there so many psychopaths
in senior management positions?
The study
A more recent study (Psychopathy,
Intelligence and Emotional Responding in a Non-Forensic Sample),
published in 2014 in the Journal of Forensic Psychiatry and
Psychology, shed new light on the behavior of psychopaths,
which could explain this phenomenon.
During an experiment, a group of
people were given a standard test of psychopathy. At the same
time, the participants were shown a series of picture aimed to
test their levels
of empathy.
For this purpose, the researchers
measured their galvanic skin response to examine their emotional
reaction to the shown pictures.
The research showed that
psychopaths with average or
high levels of intelligence were able to control their galvanic
skin response. As a result of this, their responses
appeared normal.
At the same time, psychopaths with
low IQ exhibited abnormal test results, which are typical for
individuals with psychopathic tendencies.
What the results
mean
Psychopaths are great
manipulators, and this research provides new evidence
for that.
The results of the study suggest
that psychopaths with high IQs
are able to hide their true identity, faking their emotional
responses and probably personality traits as well.
As a result, they often show a
different picture of themselves and trick others into believing
this is their real self.
Carolyn Bate,
the first author of the study,
said:
"The ones who are at the top of businesses are often
charming and intelligent, but with emotional deficits, as
opposed to psychopaths who are quite erratic and tend to
commit gruesome crimes and are often caught and imprisoned."
She also thinks that
psychopaths in positions of power could be far more
than 3%,
"because
if people are aware they are psychopathic they can also lie
- they are quite manipulative and lack empathy."
These findings are quite interesting
to consider and could apply to other spheres except for the
business world.
I'm sure that
if psychologists had the
opportunity to study those in positions of political power, the
figure would go beyond 3%. Being manipulative and able
to fake one's emotions is a quality that certainly helps one
become a successful politician.
Not even to mention that in order to
reach the highest levels of political power, some lack of
empathy and conscience is a must.
Dr.
Paul Babiak writes in his book,
Snakes in Suits - When Psychopaths Go to
Work:
"They
are masters of impression management.
Their
insight into the psyche of others combined with a
superficial - but convincing - verbal fluency allows them to
change their situation skillfully as it suits the situation
and their game plan."
Doesn't this sound like most of
our politicians?
They are just playing their game,
tricking people into believing that their concerns about the
world and society are sincere. They pretend to care while in
reality, they only want more power and money.
And we don't even need a study to
know this for sure.
