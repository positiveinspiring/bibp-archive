For nearly a century the Palestinian people have felt the pressures of
outsiders scheming to take over their homeland. For the past sixty years the
invaders have systematically undertaken the ethnic cleansing of Palestine to
make way for new Israelis.
For this purpose the invaders have constructed a
narrative the central theme of which is,
"God gave this land to us five or six
thousand years ago, and the fact that we have seldom lived here in that
period is immaterial. No matter who has lived on the land for the past
several thousand years, it is ours and we intend to take it. We do not
intend to pay for the land or the property on it that we may destroy,
and we do not intend to tolerate the future presence of any historic
owner on this land.
We, the ringleaders of this scheme, the
Ashkenazim, do not have ancestors who were ever a part of this land, but
we will take this land anyway and found a Jewish state."
In line with this story, since 1947-48 the true
believers in this Ashkenazim scheme have driven hundreds of thousands
of Palestinians from their farms, homes and businesses; they have killed and
imprisoned thousands more; and they currently keep 3.5 million survivors and
their offspring in two open air prisons - the Gaza Strip and shrinking
portions of the region known as the West Bank of the Jordan River.
The followers of this
Ashkenazim scheme barely tolerate the
presence of 1.25 million descendents of the original Palestinian inhabitants
of the land in Israel. Meanwhile, the subscribers to a scheme called
Eretz Yisrael (or Greater Israel), work
toward the eventual expulsion of all non-Jews from the territory that the
Old Testament of Christendom, also known as the Torah of Judaism, says God
promised to Abraham and his descendents.
Meanwhile, in a seemingly perverse treatment of the Zionist scheme that the
Ashkenazim and their followers pursue, God and nature take care of their
own.
The reality is that the nominally Jewish (at
least by religious affiliation) and the nominally Arab (meaning non-Jewish)
peoples of the region are about equal in number. In the nature of things,
however, the Arabs, threatened on all sides by poverty, confinement,
expulsion or extinction, have a relatively high birthrate.
The Ashkenazim and their followers, nominally
including the indigenous Palestinian Jews, are more comfortable, less
threatened and less fertile. In fairly short order, barring a catastrophe,
the Palestinians will outnumber the Jews. That is the nearby reality facing
the Zionists. A Jewish state with a majority of Palestinians is simply not
thinkable.
But a Jewish state that ignores the rights of the Palestinians should also
be unthinkable. The
Goldstone Report just released by the UN
Commission on Human Rights rightly and clearly condemns Israeli excesses
in the war on Gaza. However, in a strained effort to be even-handed, the
Commission also condemns Palestinian lobbing of rockets into Israeli
territory while it was being bombed daily by Israeli aircraft.
The report does not question Israel's right to
attack Gaza, only its excesses in doing so, but it does not concede any
Hamas right to attack adjacent areas of Israel. The report also bemoans the
continued imprisonment of one Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, while failing
to mention the 11,000 or so Palestinians in Israeli prisons.
A fair weighting of Israeli actions in Gaza
would put Israel's cast lead on one side and a few Palestinian pebbles on
the other, but Goldstone himself, a highly respected South African Jew,
would know better than most how difficult it is to achieve real balance in
this situation. Meanwhile, the President of the United States, in a message
to world Jews on the occasion of Rosh Hashanah, has rededicated
himself to the security of Israel without ever mentioning Palestine.
All of that is by way of answering a question: Just what do Prime Minister
Benyamin Netanyahu and his hard right collaborators have in
mind?
They are proceeding rapidly on two fronts.
-
No matter what they say, one is to
expand both the number of settlements and the Jewish population of
the West Bank as rapidly as possible. In the face of US pressure to
cease and desist, the goal is as rapidly as possible to create new
facts on the ground that will be difficult to ignore.
-
The other is to erase or, at the very
least, enlittle the Arab presence in old Jerusalem. As they have
done in many other areas of ancient Palestine, the Israeli scheme is
to obliterate the signs of Palestinian history, including some truly
historic sites in old Jerusalem, and create on the landscape
whatever will serve a Jewish history.
The underlying tragedy of it all is that ancient
communities, the physical evidences of their past, and their traditional
populations are all being erased in a Zionist effort to create the
narrative of a Jewish state. These are not mere acts of ethnic
cleansing - a war crime anywhere else on earth; they are systematic
efforts to erase a culture and the evidence of its history - which is a
crime against all of human society.
Is the rest of the world truly asleep to this travesty?
International media seem locked on providing an
Israel-centered and trivial display of these events. One that is only
slightly less trivial than the apparent efforts of the Obama team to
achieve some visible political success by stopping settlement expansion,
even for a few months.
The problem is not really about interrupting
the spread of Israelis into Palestinian territory. That would be simple
if the Israeli extremists were prepared to accept defined boundaries for
Israel and leave the rest of the land to its rightful owners. Settlements
are the most visible manifest of the Greater Israel dream. They have
been its mode of achievement since the first day, and they proceed on the
clear appreciation of Israelis on the move that there are no intervening
boundaries.
Israel simply has not agreed to any permanent
boundary around its already illegally acquired part of Palestine, because
that would bring the whole show to a defined halt. A temporary halt in
building or expanding settlements is simply no substitute for Israeli
acceptance that their state is bounded like any other and they must get used
to living on the land within those bounds.
That alone would be a major legal concession by
the Palestinians, because the Israelis stole the land in the first place.
The rest of the world for decades has remained largely silent on this
situation. To be sure, the situation is freakish. The lands in question have
belonged to Palestinian families for centuries. However, in a meeting with
George W. Bush in 2004, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon received a letter from Bush that says the Israelis can keep the
Palestinian lands they have expanded into illegally.
Treatment of that letter in comments of
politicians and media stories have suggested that with its creation the
ownership of lands in Palestine was simply unhooked from traditional rules
of land title. Nobody, so far, has raised the obvious fact that George W.
Bush had no legal right to convey a single square inch of Palestinian land
to an Israeli, unless, of course, he was acting, by consent, as
the agent of a Palestinian landowner and the owner received appropriate
compensation.
The tragedy of this situation is that nobody
seems prepared to stand up for the rights of the Palestinians. Virtually any
place on earth other than Palestine, taking a piece of land in the Israeli
manner would be cause for immediate and clear-cut legal rebuttal, if not a
gunfight.
It has become easy, it seems, to deal with the Palestinians as non-people.
Bush and Sharon didn't consult the Palestinians about transferring their
lands to Israelis; they just did it. Netanyahu and his team don't ask the
Palestinians in East Jerusalem about whether they want to leave their
ancestral homes; they just shove them out.
The rest of the world, where land ownership is
bounded by rigorous rules, does not object or raise issues of law and
fairness. This means basically that the world will tolerate Zionist empire
building and will allow deliberate violation of the rights of the
Palestinian people to achieve it.
There is an ironic side to this scenario. Virtually all of the Palestinians
being mistreated by these processes are
Semites. They are the sons of Shem just
as the Jews who are referred to as the "people of the book".
The leading Jews who are pressing the case are
the Ashkenazim, who are not Semites.
There are about ten million people in the
ancient Palestine territory, and they are about equally divided between
Israelis and Palestinians. In simple human terms, are the rights of the
Jewish side of this population greater and more important than the rights of
the Palestinian side of it? Israeli words and actions often say so, but
should the rest of the world agree?
These are issues that cannot be resolved by
tinkering with settlement building, expansion or maintenance.
The real questions are:
Any answer other than yes would violate
basic human rights and the principles of international law. One cannot in
good conscience fail to recognize this reality and respond to it without
being anti-Semitic.
Meanwhile, how can the situation be fixed?
-
The first rule has to be that in any
discussion that seeks to fix the terms of their future, their
rights, or the disposition of their property, responsible
Palestinian representatives will always be present and will speak
for the Palestinian people. The Bush-Sharon type of letter-writing
agreement is a travesty of international law and procedure.
-
The second rule is that Bush-Sharon type
agreements that did not include the willing participation of
Palestinian representatives are scrubbed herewith and cease to be
treated as if they have legal standing.
-
The third rule is that any disputes
between the Palestinians and the Israelis over property ownership
should be mediated by detached third parties, preferably from the
UN or the International Court of Justice.
-
The fourth rule, of course, is that
Israel actually undertakes to control its people, to curb their long
established habit of taking what does not belong to them. That
means, even at some risk, that invasive settlements of all kinds
must stop.
-
The fifth rule is that if Israel refuses
to abide by such conditions it should be treated internationally as
a rogue state and sanctioned as rigorously as any other state
that refuses to behave.
None of that would be simple, but it would be
about time.
