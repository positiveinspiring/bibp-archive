For those of us who were trained in a
psychoanalytical approach to the patient which was characterized as patient
centered, and which acknowledged that the effort to understand the world of
the other person entailed an awareness that the treatment was essentially
one of mutuality and trust, the American Psychiatry Association's
Diagnostic Criteria for Schizotypal Personality was always a cause for
alarm.
The Third Edition (1987) of Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) required that there
be at least four of the characteristics set out for a diagnosis of
schizophrenia, and an approved selection of four could be: magical thinking,
telepathy or sixth sense; limited social contact; odd speech; and
over-sensitivity to criticism.
By 1994, the required number of qualifying
characteristics were reduced to two or more, including, say, hallucinations
and 'negative' symptoms such as affective flattening, or disorganized or
incoherent speech or only one if the delusions were bizarre or the
hallucination consisted of a voice keeping up a running commentary on the
person's behavior or thoughts. The next edition of the DSM is not due until
the year 2010.
In place of a process of a labeling which brought alienation and often
detention, sectioning, and mind altering anti-psychotic medication, many
psychoanalysts and psychotherapists felt that even in severe cases of
schizoid withdrawal we were not necessarily wasting our time in attempting
to restore health by the difficult work of unraveling experiences in order
to make sense of an illness.
In this way, psychoanalysis has been, in its
most radical form, a critic of a society, which failed to exercise
imaginative empathy when passing judgment on people.
The work of Harry
Stack Sullivan, Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, Harold Searles or
R.D. Laing - all trained as psychiatrists and all of them rebels
against the standard procedures provided a way of working with people very
different from the psychiatric model, which seemed to encourage a society to
repress its sickness by making a clearly split off group the carriers of it.
A psychiatrist in a mental hospital once joked
to me, with some truth, when I commented on the number of carrier bags
carried by many of the medicated patients around the hospital grounds, that
they assessed the progress of the patient in terms of the reduction of the
number of carrier bags.
It is too often difficult to believe, however,
when hearing the history of a life, that the "schizophrenic" was not
suffering the effects of having been made, consciously and unconsciously,
the carefully concealed carrier of the ills of the family.
For someone who felt his mind was going to pieces, to be put into the
stressful situation of the psychiatric examination, even when the
psychiatrist acquitted himself with kindness, the situation of the
assessment procedure itself, can be 'an effective way to drive someone
crazy, or more crazy.' (Laing, 1985, p 17).
But if the accounting of bizarre experiences
more or less guaranteed you a new label or a trip to the psychiatric ward,
there is even more reason for a new group of people to be outraged about how
their symptoms are being diagnosed. A doubly cruel sentence is being imposed
on people who are the victims of the most appalling abuse by
scientific-military experiments, and a totally uncomprehending society is
indifferent to their evidence.
For the development of a new class of weaponry
now has the capability of entering the brain and mind and body of another
person by technological means.
Harnessing neuroscience to military capability, this technology is the
result of decades of research and experimentation, most particularly in the
Soviet Union and the United States. (Welsh, 1997, 2000)
We have failed to comprehend that the result of
the technology that originated in the years of the arms race between the
soviet Union and the West, has resulted in using satellite technology not
only for surveillance and communication systems but also to lock on to human
beings, manipulating brain frequencies by directing,
...and by use of these or other energy fields
which form the areas of study for astro-physics.
Since the operations are characterized by
secrecy, it seems inevitable that the methods that we do know about, that
is, the exploitation of the ionosphere, our natural shield, are already
outdated as we begin to grasp the implications of their use.
The patents deriving from Bernard J. Eastlund's
work provide the ability to put unprecedented amounts of power in the
Earth's atmosphere at strategic locations and to maintain the power
injection level, particularly if random pulsing is employed, in a manner far
more precise and better controlled than accomplished by the prior art, the
detonation of nuclear devices at various yields and various altitudes. (ref
High Frequency Active Auroral Research Project,
HAARP).
Some patents, now owned by Raytheon, describe how to make "nuclear sized
explosions without radiation" and describe power beam systems,
electromagnetic pulses and over-the-horizon detection systems.
A more disturbing use is the system developed
for manipulating and disturbing the human mental process using pulsed
radio frequency radiation (RFR), and their use as a device for
causing negative effects on human health and thinking. The victim, the
innocent civilian target is locked on to, and unable to evade the menace by
moving around. The beam is administered from space.
The HAARP facility as military technology could
be used to broadcast global mind-control, as a system for manipulating and
disturbing the human mental process using pulsed radio frequency
(RFR). The super-powerful radio waves are beamed to the ionosphere, heating
those areas, thereby lifting them. The electromagnetic waves bounce back to
the earth and penetrate human tissue.
Dr Igor Smirnov, of the Institute of Psycho-Correction in Moscow,
says:
"It is easily conceivable that some Russian
'Satan', or let's say Iranian or any other 'Satan', as long as he owns
the appropriate means and finances, can inject himself into every
conceivable computer network, into every conceivable radio or television
broadcast, with relative technological ease, even without disconnecting
cables
and intercept the radio waves in the ether and modulate every
conceivable suggestion into it. This is why such technology is
rightfully feared."
(German TV documentary, 1998).
If we were concerned before about diagnostic
criteria being imposed according to the classification of recognizable
symptoms, we have reason now to submit them to even harsher scrutiny.
The development over the last decades since the
Cold War arms race has included as a major strategic category,
psycho-electronic weaponry, the ultimate aim of which is to enter the brain
and mind.
Unannounced, undebated and largely unacknowledged by scientists or
by the governments who employ them technology to enter and control minds
from a distance has been unleashed upon us.
The only witnesses who are speaking about this
terrible technology with its appalling implications for the future, are the
victims themselves and those who are given the task of diagnosing mental
illness are attempting to silence them by classifying their evidence and
accounts as the symptoms of schizophrenia, while the dispensers of psychic
mutilation and programmed pain continue with their work, aided and
unopposed.
If it was always crucial, under the threat of psychiatric sectioning, to
carefully screen out any sign of confused speech, negativity, coldness,
suspicion, bizarre thoughts, sixth sense, telepathy, premonitions, but above
all the sense that "others can feel my feelings, and that someone seemed to
be keeping up a running commentary on your thoughts and behavior," then
reporting these to a psychiatrist, or anyone else for that matter who was
not of a mind to believe that such things as mind-control could exist, would
be the end of your claim to sanity and probably your freedom.
For one of the salient characteristics of
mind-control is the running commentary, which replicates so exactly, and
surely not without design, the symptoms of schizophrenia. Part of the effort
is to remind the victim that they are constantly under control or
surveillance.
Programs vary, but common forms of reminders are
electronic prods and nudges, body noises, twinges and cramps to all parts of
the body, increasing heart beats, applying pressures to internal organs
all with a personally codified system of comments on thoughts and events,
designed to create stress, panic and desperation. This is mind control at
its most benign.
There is reason to fear the use of beamed energy
to deliver lethal assaults on humans, including cardiac arrest, and bleeding
in the brain.
It is the government system of secrecy, which has facilitated this appalling
prospect. There have been warning voices.
"
the government secrecy system as a whole
is among the most poisonous legacies of the Cold War
the Cold War
secrecy (which) also mandate(s) Active Deception
a security manual for
special access programs authorizing contractors to employ 'cover stories
to disguise their activities. The only condition is that cover stories
must be believable."
(Aftergood & Rosenberg, 1994; Bulletin of
Atomic Scientist).
Paranoia has been aided and abetted by
government intelligence agencies.
In the United Kingdom the fortifications against any disturbing glimmer of
awareness of such actual or potential outrages against human rights and
social and political abuses seem to be cast in concrete. Complete with
crenellations, ramparts and parapets, the stronghold of nescience reigns
supreme.
To borrow Her Majesty the Queen's recent
observation:
"There are forces at work of
which we are not aware."
One cannot say that there is no British
Intelligence on the matter, as it is quite unfeasible that the existence of
the technology is not classified information.
Indeed it is a widely held
belief that the women protesting against the presence of cruise missiles at Greenham Common were victims of electro-magnetic radiation at gigahertz
frequency by directed energy weapons, and that their symptoms, including
cancer, were consistent with such radiation effects as reported by Dr
Robert Becker who has been a constantly warning voice against the perils
of electro-magnetic radiation.
The work of Allen Frey suggests that we
should consider radiation effects as a grave hazard producing increased
permeability of the blood-brain barrier, and weakening crucial defenses of
the central nervous system against toxins. (Becker, 1985, p. 286).
Dr Becker has written about nuclear magnetic
resonance as a familiar tool in medicine known as magnetic resonance imaging
or MRI.
Calcium efflux is the result of cyclotronic
resonance which latter can be explained thus: If a charged particle or ion
is exposed to a steady magnetic field in space, it will begin to go into a
circular or orbital, motion at right angles to the applied magnetic field.
The speed with which it orbits will be determined by the ratio between the
charge and the mass of the particle and by the strength of the magnetic
field. (Becker, 1990,p.235)
The implications of this for wide scale
aggression by using a combination of radar based energy and the use of
nuclear resonating are beyond the scope of the writer, but appear to be
worth the very serious consideration of physicists in assessing how they
might be used against human beings.
Amongst medical circles, however, it has so far not been possible for the
writer to find a neuroscientist, neurologist or a psychiatrist, nor for that
matter, a general medical practitioner, who acknowledges even the potential
for technological manipulation of the nervous system as a problem requiring
their professional interest.
There has been exactly this response from some
of England's most eminent practitioners of the legal profession, not
surprisingly, because the information about such technology is not made
available to them. They would refer anyone attempting to communicate mind-
harassment as a psychiatric problem, ignoring the crime that is being
committed.
The aim here is not to attempt a comprehensive history and development of
the technology of mind control. These very considerable tasks - which have
to be done under circumstances of the most extreme difficulty - have been
addressed with clarity and courage by others, who live with constant harm
and threats, not least of all contemptuous labeling.
Their work can be readily accessed on the
internet references given at the end of this paper. For a well-researched
outline of the historical development of electro-magnetic technology the
reader should refer to the timeline of dates and electromagnetic weapon
development by Cheryl Welsh, president of Citizens against Human
Rights Abuse. (Welsh 1997; 2001).
There are at least one and a half thousand
people worldwide who state they are being targeted.
Mojmir Babacek, now domiciled in his
native Czech Republic, after eight years of residence in the United States
in the eighties, has made a painstakingly meticulous review of the
technology, and continues his research. (Babacek 1998, 2002)
We are concerned here with reinforcing in the strongest possible terms:
-
The need for such abuses to human rights
and the threats to democracy to be called to consciousness, and
without further delay
-
To analyze the reasons why people might
defend themselves from becoming conscious of the existence of such
threats
-
To address the urgent need for
intelligence, imagination, and information - not to mention
compassion - in dealing with the victims of persecution from this
technology
-
To alert a sleeping society, to the
imminent threats to their freedom from the threat from fascist and
covert operations who have in all probability gained control of
potentially lethal weaponry of the type we are describing.
It is necessary to emphasize that at present
there is not even the means for victims to gain medical attention for the
effects of radiation from this targeting.
Denied the respect of credulity of being used as
human guinea pigs, driven to suicide by the breakdown of their lives, they
are treated as insane at best regarded as 'sad cases'.
Since the presence of a permanent
'other' in
one's mind and body is by definition an act of the most intolerable cruelty,
people who are forced to bear it but who refuse to be broken by it, have no
other option than to turn themselves into activists, their lives consumed by
the battle against such atrocities, their energies directed to alerting and
informing the public of things they don't want to hear or understand about
evil forces at work in their society.
It is necessary, at this point, to briefly outline a few one might say the
precious few attempts by public servants to verify the existence and
dangers inherent in this field:
-
In January 1998, an annual public
meeting of the French National Bioethics Committee was held in
Paris.
Its chairman, Jean-Pierre Changeux,
a neuroscientist at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, told the
meeting that,
-
"advances in cerebral imaging make
the scope for invasion of privacy immense. Although the
equipment needed is still highly specialized, it will become
commonplace and capable of being used at a distance. That will
open the way for abuses such as invasion of personal liberty,
control of behavior and brainwashing. These are far from being
science-fiction concerns
and constitute "a serious risk to
society."
("Nature." Vol 391, 1998.
-
In January 1999, the European Parliament
passed a resolution where it calls,
-
"for an international
convention introducing a global ban on all development and
deployment of weapons which might enable any form of
manipulation of human beings. It is our conviction that this ban
can not be implemented without the global pressure of the
informed general public on the governments. Our major objective
is to get across to the general public the real threat which
these weapons represent for human rights and democracy and to
apply pressure on the governments and parliaments around the
world to enact legislature which would prohibit the use of these
devices to both government and private organizations as well as
individuals."
(Plenary sessions/Europarliament,
1999)

In October 2001, Congressman Dennis
J. Kucinich introduced a bill to the House of Representatives
which, it was hoped would be extremely important in the fight to
expose and stop psycho-electronic mind control experimentation on
involuntary, non-consensual citizens.
The Bill was referred to the
Committee on Science, and in addition to the Committee on
Armed Services and International Relations. In the original bill
a ban was sought on 'exotic weapons' including electronic,
psychotronic or information
weapons,
chemtrails, particle beams,
plasmas,
electromagnetic radiation,
extremely low frequency (ELF) or ultra low frequency (ULF) energy
radiation, or
mind control technologies.
Despite the inclusion of
a prohibition of the basing of weapons in space, and the use of
weapons to destroy objects or damage objects in space, there is no
mention in the revised bill of any of the aforementioned
mind-invasive weaponry, nor of the use of satellite or radar or
other energy based technology for deploying or developing technology
designed for deployment against the minds of human beings.
(Space Preservation Act, 2002)
In reviewing the development of the art of
mind-invasive technology there are a few outstanding achievements to note:
In 1969 Dr Jose Delgado, a Yale psychologist, published a book: "Physical
Control of the Mind: Towards a Psychocivilized Society". In essence, he
displayed in practical demonstrations how, by means of electrical
stimulation of the brain which had been mapped out in its relations between
different points and activities, functions and sensations - by means of
electrical stimulation - how the rhythm of breathing and heartbeat could be
changed, as well as the function of most of the viscera, and gall bladder
secretion.
Frowning, opening and closing of eyes and mouth,
chewing, yawning, sleep, dizziness, epileptic seizures in healthy persons
were induced. The intensity of feelings could be controlled by turning the
knob, which controlled the intensity of the electric current. He states at
the end of his book the hope that the new power will remain limited to
scientists or some charitable elite for the benefit of a "psychocivilized
society."
In the 1980's the neuromagnetometer was developed which functions as
an antenna and could monitor the patterns emerging from the brain. (In the
seventies the scientists had discovered that electromagnetic pulses enabled
the brain to be stimulated through the skull and other tissues, so there was
no more need to implant electrodes in the brain).
The antenna, combined with the computer, could
localize the points in the brain where the brain events occur. The whole
product is called the magnetoencephalograph.
In January 2000 the Lockheed Martin neuroengineer Dr John D. Norseen,
was quoted (US News and World Report, 2000) as hoping to turn the
electrohypnomentalaphone, a mind reading machine, into science fact. Dr
Norseen, a former Navy pilot, claims his interest in the brain stemmed from
reading a Soviet book in the 1980's claiming that research on the mind would
revolutionize the military and society at large.
By a process of deciphering the brain's
electrical activity, electromagnetic pulsations would trigger the release of
the brain's own transmitters to fight off disease, enhance learning, or
alter the mind's visual images, creating a 'synthetic reality'. By this
process of BioFusion, (Lockheed Martin, 2000) information is placed
in a database, and a composite model of the brain is created.
By viewing a brain scan recorded by
(functional) magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine,
scientists can tell what the person was doing at the time of recording say
reading or writing, or recognize emotions from love to hate.
"If this research pans out", says Norseen,
"you can begin to manipulate what someone is thinking even before they
know it."
But Norseen says he is 'agnostic' on the moral
ramifications, that he's not a mad scientist just a dedicated one.
"The ethics don't concern me," he says,
"but they should concern someone else."
The next big thing looks like being something
which we might refer to as a neurocomputer but it need not resemble a
laptop it may be reducible to whatever size is convenient for use, such as
a small mobile phone.
Arising from a break-through and exploitation of
PSI-phenomena, it may be modeled on the nervous-psychic activity of the
brain that is, as an unbalanced, unstable system of neurotransmitters and
interacting neurones, the work having been derived from the creation of a
copy of a living brain accessed by chance, and
ESP and worked on by design.
On receiving a communication from the writer on the feasibility of a machine
being on the horizon which, based on the project of collecting
electromagnetic waves emanating from the brain and transmitting them into
another brain that would read a person's thoughts, or using the same
procedure in order to impose somebody else's thoughts on another brain and
in this way direct his actions there was an unequivocal answer from IBM at
executive level that there was no existing technology to create such a
computer in the foreseeable future.
This is at some variance with the locating of a
patent numbered 3,951,134 on the Internet
pages of IBM Intellectual Property Network for a device, described in
the patent, as capable of picking up at a distance the brain waves of a
person, process them by computer and emit correcting waves which will change
the original brain waves.
Similar letters addressed to each of the four
top executives of Apple Inc., in four individual letters marked for
their personal attention, produced absolutely no response. This included the
ex- Vice President of the United States, Mr Al Gore, newly elected to
the Board of Directors of Apple.
Enough people have been sufficiently concerned by the reports of victims of
mind control abuse to organize The Geneva Forum, in 2002, held as a
joint initiative of,
-
the Quaker United Nations Office, Geneva
-
the United Nations Institute for
Disarmament Research
-
the International Committee of the Red
cross, and the Human Rights Watch (USA), and Citizens against Human
Rights Abuses (CAHRA)
-
the Program for Strategic and
International Security Studies, which was represented by the
Professor and Senior Lecturer from the Department of Peace Studies
at the University of Bradford
In England, on May 25, 1995, the Guardian
newspaper in the U.K. carried an article based on a report by Nic Lewer,
the peace researcher from Bradford University, which listed,
"more than 30 different lines of research
into 'new age weapons'
" "some of the research sounds even less
rational. There are, according to Lewer, plans for 'pulsed microwave
beams' to destroy enemy electronics, and separate plans for
very-low-frequency sound beams to induce vomiting, bowel spasm,
epileptic seizures and also crumble masonry."
Further, the article states,
"There are plans for 'mind control' with the
use of 'psycho-correction messages' transmitted by subliminal audio and
visual stimuli. There is also a plan for 'psychotronic weapons'
apparently the projection of consciousness to other locations and
another to use holographic projection to disseminate propaganda and
misinformation."
(Welsh, Timeline).
Apart from this notable exception it is
difficult to locate any public statement of the problem in the United
Kingdom.
Unfortunately, the problem of credulity does not necessarily cease with
frequent mention, as in the United States, in spite of the number of
reported cases, there is still not sufficient public will to make strenuous
protest against what is not only already happening, but against what will
develop if left unchecked.
It appears that the administration believes that
it is necessary and justifiable, in the interests of national security, to
make experimental human sacrifices, to have regrettable casualties, for
there to be collateral damage, to suffer losses in place of strife or war.
This is, of course, totally incompatible with
any claims to be a democratic nation which respects the values of human life
and democracy, and such an administration which tutors its servants in the
ways of such barbaric tortures must be completely condemned as uncivilized
and hypocritical.
Disbelief as a Defense
Mechanism
In the face of widespread disbelief about mind-control, it seems worth
analyzing the basis of the mechanisms employed to maintain disbelief:
-
In the sixties, Soviet dissidents
received a significant measure of sympathy and indignant protest
from western democracies on account of their treatment, most notedly
the abuse of psychiatric methods of torture to which they were
subjected.
It is noteworthy that we seem to be able to access
credulity, express feelings of indignant support when we can
identify with victims, who share and support our own value system,
and who, in this particular historical case, reinforced our own
values, since they were protesting against a political system which
also threatened us at that time.
Psychologically, it is equally important
to observe that support from a safe distance, and the benefits to
the psyche of attacking a split-off 'bad father', the soviet
authorities in this case, presents no threat to one's internal
system; indeed it relieves internal pressures. On the other hand,
recognizing and denouncing a similar offence makes very much greater
psychic demands of us when it brings us into conflict with our own
environment, our own security, our own reality.
The defense against disillusion serves
to suppress paranoia that our father figure, the president, the
prime minister, our governments - might not be what they would like
to be seen to be.
-
The need to deposit destructive envy and
bad feelings elsewhere, on account of the inability of the ego to
acknowledge ownership of them - reinforces the usefulness of persons
or groups, which will serve to contain those, disowned, projected
feelings which arouse paranoid anxieties.
The concepts of
mind-invasion strike at the very heart of paranoid anxiety, causing
considerable efforts to dislodge them from the psyche.
The unconscious identification of
madness with dirt or excrement is an important aspect of anal
aggression, triggering projective identification as a defense.
-
To lay oneself open to believing that a
person is undergoing the experience of being invaded mentally and
physically by an unseen manipulator requires very great efforts in
the self to manage dread.
-
The defense against the unknown finds
expression in the split between theory and practice; between the
scientist as innovator and the society who can make the moral
decisions about his inventions; between fact and science fiction,
the latter of which can present preposterous challenges to the
imagination without undue threat, because it serves to reinforce a
separation from the real.
-
Identification with the aggressor.
Sadistic fantasies, unconscious and conscious, being transferred on
to the aggressor and identified with, aid the repression of fear of
passivity, or a dread of punishment.
This mechanism acts to deny credulity to
the victim who represents weakness. This is a common feature of
satanic sects.
-
The liberal humanist tradition which
denies the worst destructive capacities of man in the effort to
sustain the belief in the great continuity of cultural and
scientific tradition; the fear, in one's own past development, of
not being 'ongoing', can produce the psychic effect of reversal into
the opposite to shield against aggressive feelings.
This becomes then the exaggerated
celebration of the 'new' as the affirmation of human genius which
will ultimately be for the good of mankind, and which opposes
warning voices about scientific advances as being pessimistic,
unenlightened, unprogressive and Luddite.
Strict adherence to this liberal
position can act as overcompensation for a fear of envious spoiling
of good possessions, i.e. cultural and intellectual goods.
-
Denial by displacement is also employed
to ignore the harmful aspects of technology. What may be harmful for
the freedom and good of society can be masked and concealed by the
distribution of new and entertaining novelties. The technology,
which puts a camera down your gut for medical purposes, is also used
to limit your freedom by surveillance.
The purveyors of innovative technology
come up with all sorts of new gadgets, which divert, entertain and
feed the acquisitive needs of insatiable shoppers, and bolster the
economy. The theme of "Everything's up to date in Kansas City" only
takes on a downside when individual experience exploding breast
implants, say takes the gilt off the gingerbread.
Out of every innovation for evil (i.e.
designed for harming and destroying) some 'good' (i.e. public
diversion or entertainment) can be promoted for profit or
crowd-pleasing.
-
NASA is sending a spacecraft to
Mars, or so we are told. They plan to trundle across the Martian
surface searching for signs of water and life.
We do not hear dissenting voices about
its feasibility.
-
Why is it that, when a person
accounts that their mind is being disrupted and they are being
persecuted by an unseen method of invasive technology, that we
cannot bring ourselves to believe them?
-
Could it be that the horror involved
in the empathic identification required brings the shutters
down?
Conversely, the shared experience of the
blasting of objects into space brings with it the possibilities of
shared potency or the relief that resonates in the unconscious of a
massive projection or evacuation a shared experience which is
blessed in the name of man's scientific genius.
-
The desire 'not to be taken in', not to
be taken for a fool, provides one of the most powerful and common defence mechanism against credulity.
Power, Paranoia and
Unhealthy Governments
The ability to be the bearer and container of great power without succumbing
to the pressures of latent narcissistic psychoses is an important matter too
little considered.
The effect of holding power and the expectation
and the need to be seen as capable of sustaining it, if not exercising it,
encourages omnipotence of thought. In the wake of this, a narcissistic
overvaluation of the subject's own mental processes may set in. In the
effort to hold himself together as the possessor, container and executor of
power, he (or indeed, she) may also, undergo a process of splitting which
allows him, along with others, to bear enthralled witness of himself in this
illustrious role.
This may mean that the seat of authority is
vacated, at least at times. The splitting process between the experiencing
ego and the perceiving ego allows the powerful leader to alternate his
perception of himself inside and outside, sometimes beside, himself. With
the reinforcement of himself from others as his own narcissistic object,
reality testing is constrained. In this last respect, he has much in common
with the other powerful figure of the age, the movie star. or by those, in
Freud's words, who are "ruined by success."
In a world, which is facing increasing disillusion about the gulf between
the public platforms on which governments are elected, and the contingencies
and pragmatics of retaining defense strategies and economic investments, the
role of military and intelligence departments, with their respective tools
of domination and covert infiltration, is increasingly alarming.
Unaccountable to the public, protected from exposure and prosecution by
their immunity, licensed to lie as well as to kill, it is in the hands of
these agents that very grave threats to human rights and freedom lies.
Empowered to carry out aggression through
classified weapon experimentation which is undetectable, these men and women
are also open to corruption from lucrative offers of financial reward from
powerful and sinister groups who can utilize their skills, privileged
knowledge and expertise for frankly criminal and fascist purposes.
Our information about the psychological profiles of those who are employed
to practice surveillance on others is limited, but it is not difficult to
imagine the effects on the personality that would ensue with the persistent
practice of such an occupation, so constantly exposed to the perversions.
One gains little snatches of insight here and
there.
In his book on
CIA
mind control research (Marks, 1988), John Marks quotes
a CIA colleague's joke (always revealing for personality characteristics):
"If you could find the natural radio
frequency of a person's sphincter, you could make him run out of the
room real fast."
(One wonders if the same amusement is derived
from the ability to apply, say infra-sound above 130 decibels, which is said
to cause stoppage of the heart, according to one victim/activist from his
readings of a report for the Russian Parliament.)
Left to themselves, these servants of the state
may well feel exempt from the process of moral self-scrutiny, but the work
must be dehumanizing for the predator as well as the prey. It is probably
true that the need to control their agents in the field was an incentive to
develop the methods in use today.
It is also an effectively brutalizing training
for persecuting others.
Meanwhile the object, the prey, in a bid for not
only for survival but also in a desperate effort to warn his or her fellows
about what is going on, attempts to turn himself into a quantum physicist, a
political researcher, a legal sleuth, an activist, a neurologist, a
psychologist, a physiologist his own doctor, since he cannot know what
effects this freakish treatment might have on his body, let alone his mind.
There are always new methods to try out which
might prove useful in the search to find ways of disabling and destroying
opponents air injected into brains and lungs, lasers to strike down or
blind, particle beams, sonar waves, or whatever combination of energies to
direct, or destabilize or control.
Science and Skepticism
Scientists can be bought, not just by governments, but also by sinister and
secret societies. Universities can be funded by governments to develop
technology for unacceptably inhumane uses. The same people who deliver the
weapons - perhaps respected scientists and academics - may cite the
acceptable side of scientific discoveries, which have been developed by
experimenting on unacknowledged, unfortunate people.
In a cleaned up form, they are then possibly
celebrated as a break-through in the understanding of the natural laws of
the universe. It is not implausible that having delivered the technical
means for destruction, the innovator and thinker goes on, wearing a
different hat, to receive his (or her) Nobel Prize. There are scientists who
have refused to continue to do work when they were approached by CIA
and Soviet representatives.
These are the real heroes of science.
In the power struggle, much lies at stake in being the first to gain control
of ultimate mind-reading and mind-controlling technology. Like the nuclear
bomb, common ownership would seem by any sane calculations to cancel out the
advantage of possession, but there is always a race to be the first to
possess the latest ultimate means of mass destruction.
The most desirable form is one that can be
directed at others without contaminating oneself in the process - one that
can be undetected and neatly, economically and strategically delivered. We
should be foolish to rule out secret organizations, seeing threat only from
undemocratic countries and known terrorist groups.
As consumers in a world which is increasingly one in which shopping is the
main leisure activity, we should concern ourselves to becoming alert to the
ways in which human welfare may have been sacrificed to produce an awesome
new gadget. It may be the cause for celebration for the 'innovator', but
brought about as the result of plugging in or dialing up the living neuronal
processes of an enforced experimentee.
If we are concerned not to eat boiled eggs laid
by battery hens, we might not regard it morally irrelevant to scrutinize the
large corporations producing electronically innovative 'software.' We might
also be wary about the origins of the sort of bland enticements of dating
agencies who propose finding your ideal partner by matching up brain
frequencies and 'bio-rhythms'.
We do not know enough about the background of such technology, nor how to
evaluate it ethically. We do not know about its effects on the future,
because we are not properly informed. If governments persist in concealing
the extent of their weapon capability in the interests of defense, they are
also leaving their citizens disempowered of the right to protest against
their deployment.
More alarmingly, they are leaving their citizens
exposed to their deployment by ruthless organizations whose concerns are
exactly the opposite of democracy and human rights.
Back in the United
Kingdom
Meanwhile, back in England, the Director of the Oxford Centre for
Cognitive Neuroscience, Professor Colin Blakemore, also the
elective Chief Executive of the Medical Research Council writes to
the author that he,
"... knows of no technology (not even in the
wildest speculations of neuroscientists) for scanning and collecting 'neuronal data'
at a distance."
(Blakemore, 2003)
This certitude is at distinct variance with the
fears of other scientists in Russia and the United States, and not least of
all with the fears of the French neuroscientist, Jean-Pierre Changeux
of the French National Bioethics Committee already quoted (see page
5).
It is also very much at odds with the writing of
Dr Michael Persinger from the Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory
at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.
His article "On
the Possibility of Directly Accessing Every Human Brain by Electromagnetic
Induction of Algorithms" (1995), he describes the ways that
individual differences among human brains can be overcome and comes to a
conclusion about the technological possibilities of influencing a major part
of the approximately six billion people on this planet without mediation
through classical sensory modalities but by generating electromagnetic
induction of fundamental algorithms in the atmosphere.
Dr Persinger's work is referred to by Captain
John Tyler whose work for the American Air Force and Aerospace
programs likens the human nervous system to a radio receiver. (1990)
Very recently the leading weekly cultural BBC radio review had as one of its
guests, the eminent astro-physicist and astronomer royal, Sir Martin Rees,
who has recently published a book, "Our
Final Century", in which he makes a sober and reasoned case for
the fifty-fifty chance that millions of people, probably in a 'third-world
country' could be wiped out in the near future through biotechnology and
bio-terrorism "by error or malign release."
He spoke of this devastation as possibly coming
from small groups or cults, based in the United States.
"
few individuals with
the right technology to cause absolute mayhem."
He also said that in this century, human nature
is no longer a fixed commodity, that perhaps we should contemplate the
possibility that humans would even have implants in the brain.
The other guests on this program were both concerned with Shakespeare, one a
theatre producer and the other a writer on Shakespeare, while his remaining
guest was a young woman who had a website called "Spiked", the current theme
of which was Panic Attack, that is to say, Attack on Panic.
This guest vigorously opposed what she felt was
the pessimism of Sir Martin, regarding his ideas as essentially eroding
trust, and inducing panic. This reaction seems to typify one way of dealing
with threat and anxiety, and demonstrates the difficulty that a warning
voice, even from a man of the academic distinction of Martin Rees,
has in alerting people to that which they do not want to hear.
This flight reaction was reinforced by the
presenter who summed up the morning's discussion at the end of the program
with the words:
"We have a moral! Less panic,
more Shakespeare!"
The New Barbarism
Since access to a mind-reading machine will enable the operator to access
the ideas of another person, we should prepare ourselves for a new world
order in which ideas will be, as it were, up for grabs.
We need not doubt that the contents of another's
mind will be scooped up, scooped out, sorted through as if the event was a
jumble sale. The legal profession would therefore be well advised to
consider the laws on Intellectual Property very judiciously in order to
acquit themselves with any degree of authenticity. We should accustom
ourselves to the prospect of recognizing our work coming out of the mouth of
another.
The prospect of wide-scale fraud, and someone
posturing in your stolen clothes will not be a pretty sight. The term
"personal mind enhancement" is slipping in through the back door, to borrow
a term used by the Co-Director of the Center for Cognitive Liberty and
Ethics, and it is being done through technologically-induced mental
coercion mind raping and looting. In place of, or in addition to, cocaine,
we may expect to see 'mind-enhanced' performances on "live" television.
The brave new science of neuropsychiatry and brain mapping hopes to find
very soon, with the fMRI scanner - this "brand new toy that scientists have
got their hands on" - "the blob for love" and "the blob for guilt", (BBC
Radio 4: All in the Mind, 5 March, 2003).
Soon we will be able to order a brain scan for
anyone whose behavior strikes us as odd or bizarre, and the vicissitudes of
a life need no longer trouble us in our diagnostic assessments. In his
recent Reith Lectures for the BBC (2003), Professor Ramachandran,
the celebrated neuroscientist from the La Hoya Institute in San
Diego, California, has demonstrated for us many fascinating things that the
brain can do.
He has talked to us about personality disorders
and shown that some patients, who have suffered brain damage from head
injury, do not have the capacity to recognize their mothers.
Others feel that they are dead. And indeed he
has found brain lesions in these people. In what seems to be an enormous but
effortless leap, the self-styled "kid in a candy store" is now hoping to
prove that all schizophrenics, have damage to the right hemisphere of the
brain, which results in the inability to distinguish between fantasy (sic)
and reality.
Since Professor Ramachandran speaks of
schizophrenia in the same breath as denial of illness, or
agnosia, it is not clear, and it would be interesting to know, whether
the person with the head injury has been aware or unaware of the head
injury.
Also:
-
Does the patient derive comfort and a
better chance at reality testing when he is told of the lesion?
-
Does he feel better when he has received
the diagnosis?
-
And what should the psychoanalysts and
the psychiatrists, - feel about all those years of treating people
of whose head injuries they were absolutely unaware?
-
Was this gross negligence?
-
Were we absolutely deluded in perceiving
recovery in a sizeable number of them?
It is, however, lamentable that a neuroscientist
with a professed interest in understanding schizophrenia should seek to
provide light relief to his audience by making jokes about schizophrenics
being people who are,
"convinced that the CIA has
implanted devices in their brain to control their thoughts and actions,
or that aliens are controlling them."
(Reith Lecture, No 5, 2003).
There is a new desire for concretization. The
search for meaning has been replaced by the need for hard proof. If it
doesn't light up or add up it doesn't have validity.
The physician of the mind has become a surgeon.
"He found a lump as big as a
grapefruit!"
Facing up to the Dread and
Fear of the Uncanny
Freud believed that an exploration of the uncanny would be a major
direction of exploration of the mind in this century.
The fear of the uncanny has been with us for a
very long time. The evil eye, or the terrifying double, or intruder, is a
familiar theme in literature, notably of Joseph Conrad in
The Secret Sharer, and Maupassant's
short story, Le Horla.
Freud's analysis of the uncanny led him back to
the old animistic conception of the universe:
"
it seems as if each one of us has been
through a phase of individual development corresponding to the animistic
phase in primitive men, that none of us has passed through it without
preserving certain residues and traces of it which are still capable of
manifesting themselves, and that everything which now strikes us as 'uncanny'
fulfils the condition of touching those residues of animistic mental
activity within us and bringing them to expression."
(Freud: 1919. p.362)
The separation of birth, and the childhood fear
of 'spooks in the night', also leave their traces in each and every one of
us.
The individual experience of being alone in
one's mind the solitary fate of man which has never been questioned
before, and upon which the whole history of civilized nurture is based - is
now assaulted head-on.
Since growing up is largely synonymous with
acceptance of one's aloneness, the effort to assuage it is the basis for
compassion and protection of others; it is the matrix for the greatest good,
that of ordinary human kindness, and is at the heart of the communicating
power of great art. Even if we must all live and die alone, we can at least
share this knowledge in acts of tenderness which atone for our lonely state.
In times of loss and mental breakdown, the starkness of this aloneness is
all too clear.
The best of social and group constructiveness is
an effort to allay the psychotic anxieties that lie at the base of every one
of us, and which may be provoked under extreme enough conditions.
The calculated and technological entry into another person's mind is an act
of monumental barbarism which obliterates perhaps with the twiddling of a
dial the history and civilization of man's mental development. It is more
than an abuse of human rights, it is the destruction of meaning. For any one
who is forced into the hell of living with an unseen mental rapist, the
effort to stay sane is beyond the scope of tolerable endurance.
The imaginative capacity of the ordinary mind
cannot encompass the horror of it. We have attempted to come to terms with
the experiments of the Nazis in concentration camps. We now have the
prospect of systematic control authorized by men who issue instructions
through satellite communications for the destruction of societies while they
are driving new Jaguars and Mercedes, and going to the opera.
This is essentially about humiliation, and disempowerment. It is a
manifestation of rage acted out by those who fear impotence with such dread,
that their whole effort is directed into the emasculation and destruction of
the terrifying rival of their unconscious fantasies. In this apocalypse of
the mind the punitive figure wells up as if out of the bowels of the opera
stage, and this phantasmagoria is acted out on a global scale.
These men may be mad enough to believe they are
creating a 'psychocivilised world order". For anyone who has studied damaged
children, it is more resonant of the re-enactment from the unconscious,
reinforced by a life devoid of the capacity for empathic identification, of
the obscenities of the abused and abusing child in the savage nursery.
Other people -which were to them like Action
Man toys to be dismembered, or Barbie Dolls to be obscenely
defiled - become as meaningless in their humanity as pixilated dots on a
screen.
Although forced entry into a mind is by definition obscene, an abbreviated
assessment of the effects that mind-invaded people describe testifies to the
perverted nature of the experiments. Bizarre noises are emitted from the
body, a body known well enough by its owner to recognize the noises as
extrinsic; air is pumped in and out of orifices as if by a bicycle pump.
Gradually the repertoire is augmented:
-
twinges and spasms to the eyes, nose,
lips, strange tics, pains in the head, ringing in the ears,
obstructions in the throat, pressure on the bowel and bladder
causing incontinence
-
tingling in the fingers, feet, pressures
on the heart, on breathing, dizziness, eye problems leading to
cataracts
-
running eyes, running nose
-
speeding up of heart beats and the
raising of pressure in the heart and chest
-
breathing and chest complaints leading
to bronchitis and deterioration of the lungs
-
agonizing migraines
-
being woken up at night, sometimes with
terrifying jolts
-
insomnia
-
intolerable levels of stress from the
loss of one's privacy
This collection of assorted symptoms is a
challenge to any medical practitioner to diagnose.
There are, more seriously, if the afore-going is characterized as
non-lethal, the potential lethal effects since the capability of ultrasound
and infra-sound to cause cardiac arrest, and brain lesions, paralysis and
blindness, as well as blinding by laser beam, or inducing asphyxia by
altering the frequencies which control breathing in the brain, epileptic
seizure all these and others may be at the fingertips of those who are
developing them.
And those who do choose to use them may be
sitting with the weapon, which resembles, say, a compact mobile telephone,
on the restaurant table next to the bottle of wine, or beside them at the
swimming pool.
Finally if the victims at this point in the new history of this
mind-control, cannot yet prove their abuse, it must be asserted that, faced
with the available information about technological development it is
certainly not possible for those seeking to evade such claims to disprove
them.
To wait until the effects become widespread will
be too late.
-
For these and other reasons which this
paper has attempted to address, we would call for an acknowledgement
of such technology at a national and international level.
Politicians, scientists and neurologists, neuroscientists,
physicists and the legal profession should, without further delay,
demand public debate on the existence and deployment of psychotronic
technology; and for the declassification of information about such
devices which abuse helpless people, and threaten democratic freedom
-
Victims' accounts of abuse should be
admitted to public account, and the use of psycho-electronic weapons
should be made illegal and criminal
-
The medical profession should be helped
to recognize the symptoms of mind-control and psychotronic abuse,
and intelligence about their deployment should be declassified so
that this abuse can be seen to be what it is, and not interpreted
automatically as an indication of mental illness
If, in the present confusion and insecurity
about the search for evidence of weapons of mass destruction, we conclude
that failure to locate them - whatever the truth of the matter encourages
us to be generally complacent, then we shall be colluding with very dark
forces at work if we conclude that a course of extreme vigilance signifies
paranoia.
For there may well be other weapons of mass
destruction being developed and not so far from home; weapons which, being
even more difficult to locate, are developed invisibly, unobstructed,
unheeded in our midst, using human beings as test-beds. Like ESP, the
methods being used on humans have not been detectable using conventional
detection equipment.
It is likely that the signals being used are
part of a physics not known to scientists without the highest level of
security clearance. To ignore the evidence of victims is to deny, perhaps
with catastrophic results, the only evidence which might otherwise lead the
defenders of freedom to becoming alert to the development of a fearful new
methods of destruction.
Manipulating terrorist groups and governments
alike, these sinister and covert forces may well be very thankful for the
professional derision of the victims, and for public ignorance.
