Geert Wilders
The long awaited movie from Dutch politician
Geert Wilders, "Fitna," opens with a quote from the Quran/Koran, surah 8:60,
in English with the Arabic on the right side.
In fact, pretty much the
entire movie is composed of either quotes from the Koran or from other
Muslim authorities, as well as images of the murder and mayhem - the
terrorism - committed all over the place by Muslim fanatics over the past
decade or so. (Not enough time in the movie's 15 minutes to cover the
countless previous atrocities committed in the name of Islam worldwide.)
Wilders himself makes no verbal comment, only a
few written sentences at the end serving as a summary and call to action. It
needs to be emphasized that this movie represents words from Islamic
scriptures and authorities themselves, highlighted by violence and
oppression that appear to have been directly caused by those words.
In my review here, I will be reproducing the pertinent surahs with
additional verses at times from a different translation (where noted) that
is somewhat more comprehensible to both native and non-native speakers of
English.
I am further describing pretty much everything in the film just in
case it becomes unavailable at any point - even though, hopefully, thousands
of people have already saved it to their computers and are putting it up all
over the place.
"Let not the unbelievers think that they
will ever get away. They have not the power to do so. Muster against
them all the men and cavalry at your command, so that you may strike
terror into the enemy of God [Allah] and your enemy..."
--Q 8:59-60
(Dawood, N.J., The Koran: With a Parallel
Arabic Text, Penguin Classics, 1991, p. 183)
After this Islamic declaration of war, the movie
cuts to the horrifyingly familiar footage of the planes hitting the World
Trade Center Towers.
Yes, of course, I am well aware of the debate
as to who was really behind
the conspiracy to destroy the World Trade Center
Buildings. Here are the facts: Speaking out of both sides of their mouths,
Muslim fanatics are using 9/11 both,
-
to intimidate the world into bowing to
their will by claiming responsibility for it - as in "Europe, you will pay,
your 9/11 is on the way"
-
to
denounce "the Jews" by blaming it on
them.
Next we see the Madrid train bombings of March 11, 2004, overlain with the
wretched rantings of rabid imams calling for the deaths of infidels,
followed by gruesome images of bodies blown to bits and burned.
The next Koranic verse is 4:56:
"Those who deny Our revelations We will burn
in fire. No sooner will their skins be consumed than We shall give them
other skins, so that they may truly taste the scourge. God [Allah] is
mighty and wise."
-- Q 4:56
(Dawood, p. 86)
This violent imagery is followed by the rantings
of another rabid Muslim imam essentially advocating the beheading of Jews.
Next, he pulls out a sword and starts swinging it around, arousing the
depraved crowd, who all begin shouting,
"Allahu Akbar! (Allah is great!),"
as well as "Jihad for the sake of Allah!"
The connection of jihad with MURDER, rather than
"inner struggle," as we have been led to believe by Muslim apologists, could
not be more obvious.
Palestinian girl
jews apes
and pigs
Then we see the adorable but infamous
three-year-old Palestinian girl - already covered up in her oppressed female
state - dutifully reciting that Jews are "apes and pigs." This assertion is
true because it says so in the Koran, the little girl, who should never have
known such bigotry and hatred, tells us.
This sad scene is followed by the grisly images of Muslims dragging burned
and beaten bodies through the streets, as well as bombed-out British buses
and subway cars.
Another rabid imam is firing up the Muslim congregation by calling for the
"butchering" and "killing" of Jews.
God bless Hitler
Muslim woman
Europe be prepared for the real holocaust
We are next subjected to images of Palestinian armies, and a freakish
woman dressed in a black burkha carrying a placard warning Europe to "Be
prepared for the REAL holocaust," along with another insidious-looking
black-garbed Muslim woman bearing a sign saying, "God Bless Hitler" in red
ink.
The next segment highlights the Koranic surah 47:4:
"Therefore, when ye meet the unbelievers,
smite at their necks and when ye have caused a bloodbath among them bind
a bond firmly on them..."
Cut to an image of
Theo van Gogh with Dutch
narration asking him if he thinks "an idiot" will want to kill him, to which
he naively answers,
"No, I can't imagine that."
We know what happens next: van Gogh is shot
multiple times and his head nearly
severed by a Muslim fanatic upset over the filmmaker's movie "Submission,"
which exposed Islamic abuse of women.
In Great Britain, Muslim rabblerousers hold
signs calling for jihad against Europeans, invoking the murder of Theo van
Gogh, making it quite evident what they mean when they use the term "jihad":
"Take lessons - for you will pay with your
blood."
Palestinian
knife koran quran
The following image (above) is of another Palestinian
with face covered by a keffiyeh holding a Koran in his right hand and a
large knife in the other. We next see a "hit list" from a Dutch newspaper that included Theo van Gogh,
Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Geert Wilders.
A Saudi imam is inciting young men to be
sacrificed by going out and slitting throats and
shattering skulls, saying,
"This is the path to victory."
Nick Berg beheading
At this point we see Muslim savages begin to
hack off young American businessman Nick Berg's head. Fortunately, we are
spared the hideous sight, but we can still hear the sickening, evil torture
- followed Berg's head being held aloft by the evil Muslim barbarian.
At this point, I ask myself for the umpteenth time:
HOW CAN ANYONE DEFEND FOR ONE MOMENT THIS
HEINOUS IDEOLOGY?
On to the Koranic surah 4:89:
"They but wish that ye [you] should reject
faith as they do, and thus be on the same footing as they, so take not
friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah. But if
they turn renegades, seize them and kill them wherever ye [you] find
them and taken no friends or helpers from their ranks."
Ehsan Jami, Salman Rushdie, Ayaan Hirsi Ali fatwa
After this we see the average Afghan on the street stating that,
"Islam is the best religion there is" and
that "If someone converts to Christianity, he deserves the death
penalty."
We might here ask ourselves,
"THAT'S the 'best religion there is?'
Compared to what?!"
We are then informed by another rabid Muslim
imam that Islam is superior to all the other religions, accompanied by an
image of a Muslim desecrating a church.
Next come images of Dutch newspaper articles showing death threats against
Dutch politician Ehsan Jami, British writer Sir Salman Rushdie and Dutch
politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali - all three apostates from Islam.
On to Surah 8:39:
"Fight them until there is no dissension and
the religion is entirely Allah's."
This "holy scripture" is followed by a series of
Muslim fanatics declaring:
"Islam is a religion that wants to rule the
world. It has done so before and eventually will rule it again."
At this point, we would not be unreasonable to
think to ourselves:
"Will ABSOLUTE EVIL be allowed to dominate
the planet?"
Iranian president kissing man
The fanatic Iranian president is shown making
the same comments concerning Muslim hegemony.
From one after another Muslim
fanatic we hear the same declaration of domination over and enslavement of
non-Muslims, including the takeover of America, Britain and Europe.
Islam will dominate the world
Next we see the infamous signs,
"Islam will dominate the world" and "Freedom
go to hell."
The juxtaposition is obvious: Islam is slavery -
and we are all to be enslaved under Islam.
Freedom go to hell
We next see the phrase "The Netherlands under the
spell of Islam," with an image of two minarets in the background. A number
of images appear demonstrating the Islamization of Holland: E.g., an imam
saying that "the mosque will be part of the government of Holland," along
with a woman clad in a full black burkha pushing a baby stroller.
We see a frightening chart of the growth of Muslims in the Netherlands - an
explosion within the last two decades.
An apparently Dutch Muslim man is shown enthusiastically saying that he will
kill his mother and sister for having sex with "someone else." He emphasizes
that he will "absolutely" commit an "honor killing."
An imam states that "adultery" and "homosexuality" are "crimes" in Islam. A
postcard is shown with the many symbols of Islam in Holland, saying in
Dutch, "Greetings from the Netherlands."
Gay teenage Iranian boys
hanging
We next hear commentary in Arabic spoken in
Dutch mosques essentially calling for the end of Western civilization and
all it stands for, as well as advocating the stoning of women who "commit
adultery."
We see two young "gays" in Iran being hung by the necks, with the question,
"The Netherlands in the future?"
Bloody muslim baby
Following are disturbing images of Muslim
children whose heads have been sliced open for the vile "celebration" of
Ashoura, again with the question, "The Netherlands in the future?"
The same question attends horrifying images of girls and women being
subjected to the cruel and brutal "cultural tradition" of female genital
mutilation, which is most often done in the name of Islam. Women beheaded,
hung and shot in the name of Islam are also shown.
Newspaper headlines with a tiny fraction of the thousands of atrocities
committed in the name of Islam over the past decade are next shown. Freedom
of speech and democracy are denounced, stating, "Islam is our
alternative."
More nauseating signs of the takeover of Holland by Islamic fundamentalism:
"Honor killings" have exploded.
Schools
close on Muslim holidays. Elementary schools now have "jihad lessons."
Students are offered a "free trip to Mecca." Requests are made to teach Turkish in public
schools. Foreign imams are given special entry visas.
The murderer of Theo
van Gogh says,
"My successors are ready."
More headlines highlight how large a segment of
the Dutch Muslim population is ready to destroy Western culture, with the
Palestinian terrorist organization
Hamas freely allowed to proselytize in
Holland. Next we see headlines of the vilification of homosexuals by Muslims
in Holland, with imams "legalizing violence against gays" and advocating
throwing them from tall buildings.
Other signs are given of the Islamization of Holland, including allowing
genital mutilation and depriving women of medical attention, as well as
special Muslim investment or "halal-funding."
Indonesia protestors from the
religion of peace
Finally, we are reminded that Al-Qaeda has
issued a death penalty fatwa against Geert Wilders, the maker of this
succinct and effective expose of Muslim murder and mayhem.
The bottom line, we are told:
The Koran is a "license to kill."
We see a hand turning a page of the Koran, with
the sound of a page being torn out of a book.
We are informed, however, that
the sound was actually that of a page being torn out of a phone book, with
the ending remarks:
"For it is not up to me, but to Muslims
themselves to tear out the hateful verses from the Quran.
"Muslims want you to make way for Islam, but Islam does not make way for
you.
"The Government insists that you respect Islam, but Islam has no respect
for you.
"Islam wants to rule, submit, and seeks to destroy our Western
civilization."
We are reminded of Nazism being defeated in
Europe in 1945 and Communism in 1989, with the warning,
"Now, the islamic ideology has to be
defeated."
"Stop Islamisation.
"Defend our freedom."
The parting shot might be deemed amusing - the
now famous image of Mohammed wearing the turban-bomb, this time with the
fuse lit - were it not so true and so frightening.
(NB: I am also well aware of
Geert Wilders's long and passionate
association with Israel. While he may
therefore be receiving assistance in staying alive, from the quality of this
movie, I highly doubt that there was any great "propaganda" effort or money
put into it. The Muslim world frankly does not need any spin on it to make
it appear unattractive and frightening - all one need do is study history
and the fundamentalist Muslim nations to know that what is being portrayed
in this movie represents reality.)
Geert Wilders's "Fitna
- The Movie"
The original LiveLeak.com version was first disabled due to "very serious
threats" against staff members. It was briefly reactivated after security
measures were taken.
It was then deleted again "due to copyright issues",
probably based on the Muhammad-bomb cartoonist's legal threats.
It is
supposed to uploaded again "shortly."
