# The NSA - The Super Secret National Security Agency

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_nsa.htm

President Truman created the supersecret
National Security Agency (NSA)
by secret Executive order on November 4, 1952. Its primary purpose was to decipher the alien communications language, and establish a dialogue with the extraterrestrials.
This most urgent task was a continuation of the earlier effort.
The secondary purpose of the NSA was to monitor all communications and emissions from any and all electronic devices worldwide for the purpose of gathering intelligence, both human and alien, and to contain the secret of the alien presence.
