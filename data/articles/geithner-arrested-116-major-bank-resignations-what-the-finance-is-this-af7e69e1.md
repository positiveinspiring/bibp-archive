Judge Andrew Napolitano testifies of Treasury Secretary and Federal Reserve-insider
Timothy Geithners arrest in this 4-minute corporate news show. American
Kabuki lists the daily-increasing bank resignations.
Benjamin Fulford explain and
document history and deceit at the top of US and global finance, leading to
current and imminent arrests.
What does this mean?
Anyone with intellectual integrity and moral courage can affirm that
the
Federal Reserve system is guilty of financial fraud at its core.
The
emperor has no clothes reason is they lie in omission and commission with
a fiduciary responsibility:
-
they create debt for what we use as money
-
charge the 99% increasing aggregate interest
-
then tell us this is responsible
leadership for the public good
I teach college-level economics; the facts of a debt-based monetary
system, unpayable and increasing aggregate debt, and increasing per capita
interest costs is conservative textbook information.
If you want to
understand, Ill walk you through here.
Theres more to the charge of financial fraud at the top of US economic and
financial policy, of course. I recommend the documentation of Matt Taibbi
and David DeGraw to dive-into details of the crimes, and Ellen Brown and
American Monetary Institute to explore solutions.
Is current news of Geithner and bank leadership resignations evidence of
an emperor has no clothes breakthrough?
The people I work with and I,
dont know. What we do know is that until we have justice with the 1%s
crimes centering in war and money, well continue to document the facts and
demand their arrests. These crimes kill millions, harm billions, and loot
trillions of our dollars every year.
Until we have justice and policies for 100% of Earths inhabitants, its
just another day of civic activism.

Mass Banking Resignations Signal...
A Purging Has Begun?
by Brandon Turbeville

from
ActivistPost Website
According to a list compiled by independent
blog, American Kabuki, at least 122
banking directors, CEOs, and board members of both national and
international stature have resigned since September of last year.
The blog recently posted a list of all 122 of
these individuals with links to the announcements and reports of their
resignation.
The fact that banks have been reshuffling their personnel is, of course,
nothing new. However, 122 resignations does seem like a large number,
particularly when one realizes that many of these resignations are coming
from relatively large institutions.
As a result, there has been much speculation and concern on the part of many
observers as to what these shifts actually mean.
While it should be mentioned that the list contains resignations from some
institutions that are relatively small in terms of international finance,
one might also do well to remember that banks, insurance companies,
corporations, and governments are often tied together by a seemingly
infinite number of spiderweb connections that only become visible as certain
parts of the financial relationships are unearthed.
To be clear, this writer is not suggesting that every single bank included
in this list is part of a criminal conspiracy, cover-up, or act of
misconduct. In fact, I am not suggesting that any of them are. However, when
it comes to some institutions such as the World Bank or the Bank of England,
the history of treachery is obvious and should be kept in mind as you draw
your own conclusions.
In fact, it is the resignations taking place amidst these larger
institutions that should be a cause for greater concern in the first place.
Indeed, the number of resignations taking place amongst large institutions
such as,
-
CitiBank
-
Lloyds Banking Group
-
UBS
-
Bank of America
-
Goldman Sachs
-
JP Morgan,
...alone, should be enough to turn some heads.
But there is also an alarming number of central banks included on this list
as well. Perhaps the most surprising is the fact that Phillip Hildebrand,
the head of Switzerlands central bank, recently
handed in his resignation.
Not only that, but there have been resignations
coming from several other central banks including,
-
Argentina
-
Kuwait
-
Nicaraqua
-
Kenya
Even
the World Bank is now accepting the
resignation of Robert Zoellick.
The truth is, we dont know what these resignations actually mean.
-
Are they merely coincidence?
-
Is this par for the course in the
international banking industry?
-
Or are we witnessing the beginning of a
rush for the exits by those who are in a position to see what is
coming down the pike? Considering the state of the world financial
system, this would not be too hard to believe.
-
Or are we witnessing a panicked flight
of the guilty on the eve of a coming round of real investigations?
-
Might there be a coming worldwide
financial scandal that these individuals would drastically like to
avoid?
Either way, 122 resignations from September
to March at least sounds like a big number.
It would be nice to know exactly what the rate
of resignation was in previous years. Until we are able to find that number,
it might be wise for us to ask ourselves what these individuals know that we
dont.
