Whos behind those Foster Grants...
...The CIA, of course...
Well, now it is official.
Mark Zuckerberg was not so smart after all,
but just fronting for
the CIA in one of the biggest Intelligence coups of
all times.
But there remains one small problem, the CIA is not supposed to monitor
Americans. I guess we will hear more on that soon from the lawyers once the
litigation gets cranked up.
Personally I will be more interested in how this is going to effect the
stock offering and shares as all Americans should own the entity that has
been spying on them.
And then there are
the SEC full disclosure regulations and penalties. Its
bonanza time for the lawyers.
Could the loophole the CIA used be that,
you arent being spied on if you
are willingly posting everything a repressive regime would love to have on
your
Facebook account, with no threats, no family hostages, no dirty movies
or photos that could be released?'
But enough with the lead in.
Lets take you directly to our source where you
can get it straight from the sources mouth, including seeing Zuckerberg
getting his award.
We really need your comments on this below so we can speak to power with one
voice
something that can rarely be done around here.
I know what youre thinking, but no, I am not stupid
all of my Facebook
material is all made up, including all of my friends.
I am in the 'safe zone.'
My momma didnt raise no fool...
But how about you?
