This article is a compilation of a number of
pieces Ive written about Ed Snowden and
the NSA.
It doesnt replace them, but it hits the high points
Lets begin here:
If you absolutely must have a hero, watch
Superman movies.
If your need for a hero is so great, so cloying,
so heavy, so juicy that it swamps your curiosity, dont read this.
If you cant separate Snowdens minor revelations from the question of who
he is, if you cant entertain the notion that covert ops and
intelligence-agency games are reeking with cover stories, false trails, and
limited hangouts, you need more fun in your life.
NSA? CIA? These guys live for high-level bullshit. They get down on their
knees and worship it. They fall into a suicidal funk if they arent lying on
at least three or four levels at once.
Okay. Lets look at Snowdens brief history as
reported
by The Guardian.
In 2003, at age 19, without a high school diploma, Snowden enlists in the
Army. He begins a training program to join the Special Forces. At what point
after enlistment can a new soldier start this elite training program?
Snowden breaks both legs in an exercise. Hes discharged from the Army.
-
Is that automatic?
-
How about healing and then resuming
service?
-
If he was accepted in the Special Forces
training program because he had special computer skills, then why
discharge him simply because he broke both legs?
Sorry, Ed, but with two broken legs we just
dont think you can hack into terrorist data anymore. You were good, but
not now. Try Walmart. They always have openings.
Circa 2003, Snowden gets a job as a security
guard for an NSA facility at the University of Maryland.
Snowden shifts jobs.
Boom. Hes now in the CIA, in IT. He has no high
school diploma. Hes a young computer genius.
In 2007, Snowden is sent to Geneva. Hes only 23 years old. The CIA gives
him diplomatic cover there. Hes put in charge of maintaining
computer-network security. Major job. Obviously, he has access to a wide
range of classified documents.
Sound a little odd? Hes just a kid. Maybe he
has his GED. Otherwise, he still doesnt have a high school diploma.
Snowden says that during this period, in Geneva, one of the incidents that
really sours him on the CIA is the turning of a Swiss banker.
One night, CIA guys get a banker drunk,
encourage him to drive home, the banker gets busted, the CIA guys help him
out, then with that bond formed, they eventually get the banker to reveal
deep secrets to the Agency.
Come on...
In 2009, Snowden leaves the CIA. Why?
Presumably because hes disillusioned. It should
noted here that Snowden claimed he could do very heavy damage to the entire
US intelligence community in 2008, but decided to wait because he thought
Obama, just coming into the presidency,
might
keep his transparency promise.
After two years with the CIA in Geneva, Snowden really had the capability to
take down the whole US inter-agency intelligence network, or a major chunk
of it? If you buy that without further inquiry, I have condos for sale on
the dark side of the moon.
In 2009, Snowden leaves the CIA and goes to work in the private sector.
Dell, Booze Allen Hamilton. In this latter job, Snowden is assigned to work
at the NSA.
Hes an outsider, but, again, he claims to have so much access to so much
sensitive NSA data that he can take down the whole US intelligence network
in a single day. The. Whole. US. Intelligence. Network.
This is Ed Snowdens sketchy legend. Its all red flags, alarm bells,
sirens, flashing lights.
Then we have the crowning piece: they solved the riddle:
Ed Snowden was able to steal thousands of
highly protected NSA documents because
he had a thumb drive.
Its the weapon that breached the inner sanctum
of the most sophisticated information agency in the world. Its the weapon
to which the NSA, with all its resources, remains utterly vulnerable. Cant
defeat it.
Not only did Snowden stroll into NSA with a thumb drive, he knew how to
navigate all the security layers put in place to stop people from stealing
classified documents.
Lets see. We have a new guy coming to work
for us here at NSA today? Oh, whiz kid. Ed Snowden. Outside contractor.
Booz Allen.
Hes not really a full-time employee of the
NSA. Twenty-nine years old. No high school diploma. Has a GED. He worked
for the CIA and quit. Hmm. Why did he quit? Oh, never mind, who cares?
No problem.
Tell you what. Lets give this kid access to our most sensitive data.
Sure. Why not? Everything. That stuff we keep behind 986 walls? Where
you have to pledge the life of your first-born against the possibility
youll go rogue? Let Snowden see it all. Sure.
What the hell. Im feeling charitable. He
seems like a nice kid.
NSA is the most awesome spying agency ever
devised in this world.
If you cross the street in Podunk, Anywhere,
USA, to buy an ice cream soda, on a Tuesday afternoon in July, they know.
They know whether you sit at the counter and drink that soda or take it and
move to the only table in the store. They know whether you lick the foam
from the top of the glass with your tongue or pick the foam with your straw
and then lick it.
They know if you keep the receipt for the soda or leave it on the counter.
They know whether youre wearing shoes or sneakers. They know the brand of
your underwear. They know your shaving cream, and precisely which container
it came out of.
But this agency, with all its vast power and its dollars
Cant track one of its own, a man who came to work every day, a man who made
up a story about needing treatment in Hong Kong for epilepsy and then
skipped the country.
Just cant find him.
Cant find him in Hong Kong, where he does a sit-down video interview with
Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian. Cant find that safe house or that
hotel where hes staying.
No. Cant find him or spy on his communications while hes in Hong Kong.
Cant figure out hes booked a flight to Russia. Cant intercept him at the
airport before he leaves for Russia . Too difficult.
And this man, this employee, is walking around with four laptops that
contain the keys to all the secret spying knowledge in the known cosmos.
Cant locate those laptops. Cant hack into them to see whats there. Cant
access the laptops or the data. The most brilliant technical minds of this
or any other generation can find a computer in Outer Mongolia in the middle
of a blizzard, but these walking-around computers in Hong Kong are somehow
beyond reach.
And before this man, Snowden, this employee, skipped Hawaii, he was able to
access the layout of the entire US intelligence network. Yes.
He stole enough to,
take down the entire US intelligence
network in a single afternoon.
Not only that, but anyone who worked at this
super-agency as an analyst, as a systems-analyst supervisor, could have done
the same thing. Could have stolen the keys to the kingdom.
This is why NSA geniuses with IQs over 180 have decided, now, in the midst
of the Snowden affair, that they need to draft tighter rules and
procedures for their employees. Right.
Now, a few pieces of internal of security they hadnt realized they needed
before will be put in place.
This is, let me remind you, the most secretive spying agency in the world.
The richest spying agency. The smartest spying agency.
But somehow, over the years, theyd overlooked this corner of their own
security. Theyd left a door open, so that any one of their own analysts
could steal everything.
Could take it all. Could just snatch it away and copy it and store it on a
few laptops. But now, yes now, having been made aware of this vulnerability,
the agency will make corrections. Sure...
And reporters for elite US media dont find any of this hard to swallow. A
smart sixth-grader could see through this tower of fabricated crap in a
minute, but veteran grizzled reporters are clueless.
On the ever-solicitous Charley Rose, a gaggle of pundits/news-people
warned that Ed Snowden, walking around with those four laptops, could be an
easy target for Chinese spies or Russian spies, who could get access to the
data on those computers. The spies could just hack in.
But the NSA cant. No. The NSA cant find out what Snowden has. They can
only speculate.
The tightest and strongest and richest and smartest spying agency in the
world cant find its own employee. Its in the business of tracking, and it
cant find him.
Its in the business of security, and it cant protect its own data from its
employees. If you believe all that, I have timeshares to sell in the black
hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Here is a more likely scenario. Snowden never saw any of those thousands of
documents on an NSA computer. Never happened. He didnt hack in. He didnt
steal anything.
He was working an op, either as a dupe or knowingly.
-
He was working for
well, lets see, who
would that be?
-
Who was he working for before he entered
the private sector and wound up at NSA? The CIA.
-
Would that be the same CIA who hates the
NSA with a venomous fervor?
-
Would that be the same CIA whos been
engaged in a turf war with NSA for decades?
-
The same CIA whos watched their own
prestige and funding diminish, as human intelligence has given way
to electronic snooping?
Yes, it would be. CIA just cant match the NSA
when it comes to gathering signals-intell.
Wired Magazine, June 2013 issue. James Bamford, author of three books
on the NSA, states:
In April, as part of its 2014 budget
request, the Pentagon [which rules the NSA] asked Congress for $4.7
billion for increased cyberspace operations, nearly $1 billion more
than the 2013 allocation.
At the same time, budgets for the CIA and
other intelligence agencies were cut by almost the same amount, $4.4
billion. A portion of the money going to
[NSA] will be used to create
13 cyberattack teams.
That means spying money. Far more for NSA, far
less for CIA.
Turf war
People at the CIA were able to access those NSA documents, and they gave the
documents to Snowden and he ran with them.
The CIA, of course, couldnt be seen as the NSA leaker. They needed a guy.
They needed a guy who could appear to be from the NSA, to make things look
worse for the NSA and shield the CIA.
They had Ed Snowden. He had worked for the CIA in Geneva, in a high-level
position, overseeing computer-systems security.
Somewhere in his CIA past, Ed meets a fellow CIA guy who sits down with him
and says,
You know, Ed, things have gone too damn
far. The NSA is spying on everybody all the time. I can show you proof.
Theyve gone beyond the point of trying to catch terrorists. Theyre
doing something else.
Theyre expanding a Surveillance State,
which can only lead to one thing: the destruction of America, what
America stands for, what you and I know America is supposed to be. The
NSA isnt like us, Ed. We go after terrorists for real. Thats it.
Whereas NSA goes after everybody. We have to stop it.
We need a guy
and there are those of us who
think you might be that guy
During the course of this one disingenuous
conversation, the CIA is killing 37 innocent civilians all over the world
with drones, but thats beside the point. Ahem.
Ed says,
Tell me more. Im intrigued.
He buys in.
Put two scenarios on the truth scale and assess them. Which is more likely?
The tale Snowden told to Glenn Greenwald, with all its holes, with
its super-naive implications about the fumbling, bumbling NSA, or a scenario
in which Snowden is the CIAs boy?
We have reporters at the Washington Post and at The Guardian.
We have Julian Assange, the head of Wikileaks. Theyre all talking to
Snowden. The NSA can spy on them. Right?
Can listen to their calls and read their emails
and hack into their notes. Just like people have been hacking into the work
and home computers of Sharyl Attkisson, star CBS investigative
reporter.
But the NSA cant do all this spying and then use it to find Snowden. Just
cant manage it.
Everybody in the world with a computer has passwords. The NSA can cut
through them (as well as encryption) like a sword through hot butter. But
Assange and the Post and Guardian and Snowden have super-special passwords.
They got these passwords by sending a stamped self-addressed envelope, along
with 25 cents, and a top from a cereal box to The Shadow. These passwords
are charged with atomic clouds that obscure NSA mens minds so they cannot
see or spy. The passwords are immortal and invulnerable.
The NSA can spy on anyone else in the world, but they cant get their foot
in the door, when it comes to the Post, The Guardian, and Assange.
And if Snowden winds up in Venezuela or Tierra del Fuego, that too will
become an insurmountable mystery.
Nope, we dont know where he is. Hes
vanished. Venezuela has a Romulan shield surrounding it. The cloaking
technology is too advanced.
Perhaps you recall that, in the early days of
this scandal, Snowden claimed he could spy on anyone in the US, including a
federal judge or even the president, if he had their email addresses.
Uh-huh.
But the combined talents of the NSA, now, cant
spy on Snowden. I guess they just cant find his email address.
If Snowden is still working for the CIA, he and his buds arent the only
people who want to take the NSA down a notch. No. Because, for example, NSA
has been spying on everybody inside the Beltway. Spying on politicians with
secrets. That includes a major, major, prime NSA target: Congress.
So imagine this conversation taking place, in a car, on a lonely road
outside Washington, late at night.
The speakers are Congressman X and a private
operative representing a covert unit inside the NSA:
Well, Congressman, do you remember January
6th? A Monday afternoon, a mens room in the park off -
What the hell are you talking about!
A stall in the mens room. The kid. He was wearing white high-tops. A
Skins cap. T-shirt. Dark hair. Scar across his left cheek. Blue tattoo
on his right thigh.
Jesus.
We have very good audio and video. Anytime you want to watch it, let me
know.
Dead silence.
What do you want?
Right now, Congressman? We want you to come down hard on Snowden. Press
it. Hes a traitor. He should tried and convicted.
The Congressmen pulls himself together:
Yeah, well, theres another side to this
story. If Snowden gets enough support, if the wave rises high enough,
the NSA could take a hit.
I know a dozen Washington players whod like
that very much. Theyre pissed off. They dont like to be spied on. Its
possible Snowden was their guy from the beginning. I couldnt say
Lets make a deal.
That ends up being the topic of this and other
similar conversations inside the Beltway.
Senator, we know about the underage
cheerleader in Ohio. Your trip there in 2012, just before the election.
Look, youve brought this up before. But now Ive got a trump card to
play. Ed Snowden. This whole scandal can escalate like a tornado in
Kansas, or it can die down
Lets make a deal.
Heres another vector.
A Congressman gets a visit from his favorite
lobbyist, who works for a private defense contractor in the Congressmans
home state:
Congressman, heres the thing. The NSA is
an integral part of our nations defense system. Right? This Snowden
thing is messy. We want it to go away.
It may not go away. Im not some kind of traffic cop who can put up his
hand and stop the tide.
We understand that. I was just talking to XXX at NSA, and hed really
appreciate your help on this. Slam this bastard Snowden. Make him into
the worst scumbag in the world.
And if I do?
Your offshore account in Panama will remain protected. Thats what XXX
wanted me to tell you.
Calling in markers. Putting on pressure. Lets
make a deal.
If youre a Congressman or a Senator, and you know NSA is spying on you,
because its spying on everyone in the Congress, whos your potential best
friend? Somebody who can go up against the NSA, somebody who wants to go up
against the NSA.
And who might that be...?
The CIA
Its not perfect, but its the best you can do.
So if youre a Congressman, you go to a friend in the CIA and you have a
chat about the NSA problem. How can you get NSA off your back? Your CIA
friend has his own concerns about NSA.
He tells you in confidence:
Look, maybe we can help you. We know a lot
about the NSA. We have good people. You might say one of our jobs is
watching the watchers at NSA, to, uh, make sure they dont go too far in
their spying.
This sounds interesting. If you have to sell
your soul, youd rather sell it to the CIA than the NSA. Its a judgment
call.
And a few weeks or months later
you read about Ed Snowden blowing a hole in
the NSA. You take note of the fact that Snowden worked for the CIA. He
worked for them in Geneva. Then he left for the private sector and got
himself assigned to the NSA.
Hmm. Maybe you have some cause for optimism.
You, the Congressman, dont give a damn about the NSA spying on all
Americans all the time. You couldnt care less about that. You just dont
want NSA looking over your own shoulder.
You know the incredibly naïve American public would never imagine whats
going on behind the scenes, with CIA, NSA, and Congress. The yokels and
rubes in America actually believe their Congressional representatives are,
well, representing them in Washington.
This fact is good. It means privacy for you: you can try to work out your
problems without public scrutiny. You can play all the necessary games to
hide your own secrets and crimes, and you can do it in back rooms.
Unless those bastards at NSA decide to leak one of your embarrassing
secrets. Thats why you need your friend at CIA.
And now, again, you look at the recent article and see that Ed Snowden
worked for the CIA. You hope this a signal from the CIA that theyre taking
a battering ram to the NSA.
Some schmuck reporter asks you about the current NSA scandal and you say,
Of course we have to protect classified
data, in order to prevent terrorist attacks. But at the same time, we
need to respect the Bill of Rights. People cant go around spying on
anyone for no reason.
Youre sending your own signal.
Youre tipping your CIA guy. You appreciate his help, if in fact hes
helping you. You cant ask him directly. If you did, hed never give you a
straight answer. But just in case
As for the naïve rubes in your home state, the voters, you dont give them a
second thought. Theyre not on your radar. Theyre merely clusters of
polling data. They dont have a clue about how the game is played, and they
never will.
Youre representing two defense contractors, a pharmaceutical company, a big
Ag corporation, and a bank. Those are your only true constituents. You give
them all the time they need.
To keep those relationships on track, you only need to hide your peccadillos
from embarrassing exposure. The hooker in DC, the bank account in Panama,
the influence you used to move a sizable donation to a university where you
intend to teach when you retire.
There are only two things you really need to think about in your job. First,
what happens when your Party leaders come down the hall and tell you which
way youre going to vote on a bill - and you know your vote is going to
upset one of your key constituents back home.
Thats a tricky situation. But youve been successful in keeping feathers
from being ruffled. That pharmaceutical company understands you cant side
with their interests every single time.
Youve got to go with your Party. The Pharma boys dont like it, but they
get it.
The other thing youve got to think about is darker. Nobody is going to give
you stats on it, because stats dont exist. Heres how it shakes out:
How many people in Congress are so controlled by the NSA that theyd never
try to break out? How many people, with how many secrets, are so
blackmailed, theyd never dare go up against NSA?
This is an important calculation. The battle might already be lost. You
might not stand a chance. Maybe nobody can help you. Maybe you cant escape.
Maybe you shouldnt even hint that NSA has overstepped its legal boundaries
by spying on Americans. Thats the conundrum that keeps you up at night.
What if the spies spying on their own government are running the government
beyond the ability of anyone to stop them? You dont give a damn about what
this would mean for America. You only care about what it means for you and
your secrets.
Maybe this is the jail youre in for the rest of your life.
When youre back in your home state showing your face and giving speeches,
and a voter comes up to you and voices a concern about his dwindling
paycheck, his house payment, his endangered pension
and when you nod and
gaze out at the horizon, as as if to pluck a magic answer from the aether,
youre really thinking about the conundrum.
Youre thinking about the life sentence youre serving in the Surveillance
State.
And that night, in your hotel room, you get down on your knees and pray that
Ed Snowden is still working for the CIA.
Who else, besides the CIA and numerous politicians inside the Beltway, would
be aching to take the NSA down a notch? Who else would be rooting hard for
this former (?) CIA employee, Snowden, to succeed?
How about Wall Street?
Still waiting to be uncovered?
NSA spying to collect elite financial data,
spying on the people who have that data: the major investment banks. NSA
scooping up that data to predict, manipulate, and profit from trading
markets all over the world.
A trillion-dollar operation.
Snowden worked for Booz Allen, which is owned by
the
Carlyle Group ($170 billion in assets). Carlyle, the infamous.
Their money is making money in 160 investment funds.
A few of Carlyles famous front men in its history:
-
George HW Bush
-
James Baker (US Secretary of State)
-
Frank Carlucci (US Secretary of Defense
and CIA Deputy Director)
-
John Major (British Prime Minister)
-
Arthur Levitt (Chairman of the SEC)
Suppose youre one of the princes in the NSA
castle, and Ed Snowden has just gone public with your documents.
Youre saying,
Lets see, this kid worked for Booz Allen,
which is owned by the Carlyle Group. We (NSA) have been spying over
Carlyles shoulder, stealing their proprietary financial data. What are
the chances theyre getting a little revenge on us now?
Yes, youre thinking about that. Youre looking
into it.
The Surveillance State has created an apparatus whose implications are
staggering. Its a different world now. And sometimes it takes a writer of
fiction to flesh out the larger landscape.
Brad Thors novel, Black List, posits the existence of a
monster corporation, ATS, that stands along side the NSA in collecting
information on every move we make. ATS intelligence-gathering capability is
unmatched anywhere in the world.
At his site,
www.BradThor.com, the author lists some of
the open-source material he discovered that formed the basis for Black
List. The material, as well as the novel, is worth reading.
On pages 117-118 of Black List, Thor makes a stunning inference that,
on reflection, is as obvious as the fingers on your hand:
For years ATS [substitute NSA] had been
using its technological superiority to conduct massive insider trading.
Since the early 1980s, the company had spied
on anyone and everyone in the financial world. They listened in on phone
calls, intercepted faxes, and evolved right along with the technology,
hacking internal computer networks and e-mail accounts.
They created mountains of black dollars
for themselves, which they washed through various programs they were
running under secret contract, far from the prying eyes of financial
regulators.
Those black dollars were invested into hard
assets around the world, as well as in the stock market, through sham,
offshore corporations. They also funneled the money into reams of
promising R&D projects, which eventually would be turned around and sold
to the Pentagon or the CIA.
In short, ATS had created its own license to print money and had
assured itself a place beyond examination or reproach.
In real life, whether the prime criminal source
is one monster corporation or the NSA itself, the outcome would be the same.
Total surveillance has unlimited payoffs when it targets financial markets
and the people who have intimate knowledge of them.
Total security awareness programs of surveillance are ideal spying ops in
the financial arena, designed to grab millions of bits of inside
information, and then utilize them to make investments and suck up billions
(trillions?) of dollars.
It gives new meaning to the rich get richer.
Previously, we thought we needed to look over the shoulders of the men who
were committing major financial crimes out of public view. But now, if we
want to be up to date, we also have to factor in the men who are spying on
those criminals, who are gathering up those secrets and using them to commit
their own brand of meta-crime.
And in the financial arena, that means we think of Goldman Sachs and JP
Morgan as perpetrators, yes, but we also think about the NSA men who already
know everything about GS and Morgan, and are using this knowledge to steal
sums that might make GS and Morgan blush with envy.
Goldman Sachs, Chase, and Morgan consider trillion-dollar trading markets
their own private golden-egg farm. They run it, they own it, they manipulate
it for their own ends.
If NSA has been looking over their shoulders for the past 30 years,
discovering all their knowledge, and operating a meta invasion, siphoning
off enormous profits, NSA would rate as Enemy Number One.
And would need to be torpedoed.
Enter Ed Snowden
Finally, we need to understand what NSA and other agencies are doing, are
really doing in their ongoing creation of the Surveillance State.
Number one, theyre technocrats who are ultimately Globalists, in sheeps
clothing. Their tracking of every human on Earth is designed to morph into a
system for distribution of goods and services from a central control point.
To the whole planet. In this system, a human is a unit, a data point that
surrenders to a set of ruling algorithms.
And number two, theyre trying to create a single universal mind. Which is
to say, the flattening and reducing of human thought down to manageable
parameters of conformity and sameness.
Surveillance itself tends to achieve this over time, because when people
know they are being watched and evaluated, they simplify their mental
processes. They avoid many subjects, they avoid controversy, they express
fewer ideas, they monitor their own responses.
Surveillance tacitly encourages a limited range of thought in which all
people participate. You wind up with one cookbook of recipes for the human
condition. People make the same meals. The meals taste the same. Everybody
eats the same thing.
So far, the revelations of Edward Snowden have done nothing to stop the
juggernaut. No major hearings to expose the overall Surveillance State are
scheduled.
The NSA could take a hit, but that means nothing in the long run. In this
sense, what Snowden has exposed could be called a limited hangout. A
way to let a little steam off, a way to avoid the deeper issues.
The true wild card in the op to lock down the planet is, as always, the free
individual. The individual who takes his own freedom. The individual who
creates something unexpected, something that cant be predicted by any
system.
The individual who finds himself in the middle of the labyrinth and suddenly
has a lawnmower and cuts a new path out.
Some people think thats Snowden.
Is it?
Whatever you believe, the idea that individuals - rather than groups and
collectives - can achieve shattering breakthroughs is exactly what the
Surveillance State is trying to destroy.
