TRUE DEMOCRACY SUMMER 2001 TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Council on Foreign Relations
and the Trilateral Commission
part 2
Here is a sample of the Canadian perspective, from John Whitley's New World
Order Intelligence Update, from http://http://www.inforamp.net/~jwhitley/canpol.htm
:
The Rockefeller links of Canadian politicians...
It may re-pay the reader to spend a few minutes tracing the connections
of Paul Desmarais and Power Corp. to the leading politicians, etc. of Canada:
* JOHN RAE: leading strategist for Prime Minister
Chretien's election campaign. Was Executive Vice- President of Power Corp.
and Paul Desmarais' right- hand man. His brother is....
* BOB RAE: Rhodes Scholar and ex-NDP [Socialist]
Premier of Ontario, who appointed....
* MAURICE STRONG to the chairmanship of Ontario
Hydro, which he proceded to dramatically cut in both skilled human resources
and generating capacity [to provide a future need for power from
James Bay/Grand Canal?]
* PAUL MARTIN: current federal Finance Minister.
Rose through the ranks at Power Corp., mentored by Paul Desmarais. Bought
Canada Steamship Lines from him. Ran against Chretien for Liberal Party leadership.
He attended the 1996 meeting of the Bilderberg Group, where those he mingled
with included - surprise! - David Rockefeller.
* JEAN CHRETIEN: Prime Minister. Daughter, France,
is married to Andre Desmarais, son of Paul Desmarais, chairman of Power Corporation.
Chretien's "advisor, counsellor and strategist" for the past 30 years has
been MITCHELL SHARP, who brought Chretien into politics when he
was Finance Minister. Sharp has been, since 1981, Vice-Chairman for North
America of David Rockefeller's TRILATERAL COMMISSION. Chretien attended the
1996 meeting of the Bilderberg Group.
* DANIEL JOHNSON: present Liberal [and Opposition]
leader in Quebec. Rose through the ranks of Power Corp.
* BRIAN MULRONEY: ex-Conservative Prime Minister.
Now a lawyer and lobbyist for Power Corporation which, together with Ontario
Hydro and Hydro Quebec, has just formed the Hong Kong-based ASIA POWER CORP.,
to help China to develop its energy potential. Power Corp.'s legal interests
in Asia will be handled by a Hong Kong branch of Mulroney's Montreal law
firm, Olgilvy, Renault. He is also a well-remunerated member of the board
of Archer-Daniels-Midland, a Rockefeller-owned conglomerate, which is headed
by Dwayne Andreas who, like Rockefeller himself, is also a member of the
elite and secretive Bilderberg Group.
* Mike Harris, Premier of Ontario, who headed off
for a fishing weekend at a remote Northern camp with George Bush and
Paul Martin soon after his election. Harris, like his colleague
Ralph Klein, Premier of Alberta, is also a Bilderberger.
* Two intriguing recent additions to this list are
PRESTON MANNING, leader of the Reform Party of Canada and of Canada's
Official Opposition in the Federal Parliament, and STEPHANE DION,
Federal Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs [Canada's "Unity Minister"],
who, together with RAYMOND A.J. CHRETIEN, Canadian Ambassador to the
U.S. [and nephew of Jean Chretien, Prime Minister of Canada], attended
the tightly-guarded, super-secret 1998 BILDERBERGER CONFERENCE at
the Turnberry Arms Hotel, Ayr, Scotland, where, of course, David Rockefeller
was also in attendance. One wonders if the Bilderbergers' planned breakup
of Canada, following the projected separation of Quebec via a Unilateral
Declaration of Independence in January, 2000, and the planned 2005
Continental Union of the U.S. and the rest of Canada might have been
on the agenda...?
So...we have the CONSERVATIVE party [via Mulroney], the LIBERAL party [via
Chretien], and the NDP [via Rae] all tightly connected to....Paul Desmarais
and Power Corp.
And we have the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister, and the Prime Minister's
key aide all tightly connected to....Paul Desmarais and Power Corp
.
Mel Hurtig wrote, in THE BETRAYAL OF CANADA:
"Since Brian Mulroney became Prime Minister, Big Business has had effective
control of the political and economic agenda, and hence the social and cultural
agenda as well. Paul Desmarais provided much of the money for Pierre Trudeau's
campaign, Brian Mulroney's campaign, and Jean Chretien's campaign." [p.188]
[We hate to disillusion any of the remaining fans of ex-Prime Minister
Trudeau, but Pierre Trudeau was also a Bilderberger]
Maurice Strong has now joined Brian Mulroney and Paul Desmarais in
investing the Asia Power Group's $100 million venture capital in "small coal-fired
power plants being built in the south of China". They are also looking at
"larger projects in northern China, as well as in Malaysia, the Philippines
and India." The Asian economies are expected to spend $1 trillion [US] on
essential infrastructure, of which an estimated $400 billion [US] will be
on power generation. Chinese and Asian labour costs are low - as low, in
China, as $45 per month - and potential profits are high.
The Nov/Dec. 1993 issue of David Rockefeller's Council on Foreign Relations'
publication FOREIGN RELATIONS contains an article, THE RISE OF
CHINA, in which we are warned that China will begin to use more energy
than the United States within a few decades, massively straining the
world's energy supplies. Most of China's energy comes from the burning
of soft, high-sulphur, highly- polluting coal. In 1991 alone, 11 trillion
cubic meters of waste gases and sixteen million tons of soot were emitted
into the atmosphere over China - and it has only just begun its
long process of increased energy generation!
The sulphur in this coal causes acid rain. The burning of the coal releases
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the most efficient "greenhouse gas" in
the global warming process.
The warmer the climate becomes, the greater the need for fresh water
in Mexico and the southern United States - and the more urgent the
need for a GRAND Canal project to get it there. An astute businessman
could, if he were so inclined, potentially make astronomical profits
off both ends of this process!
Oh, and Paul Desmarais?
In September, 1993, he joined David Rockefeller's Trilateral Commission.
He won't feel out-of-place there, though. Other prominent Canadian members
include Gerald Bouey [former Governor of the Bank of Canada]; Conrad Black,
newspaper magnate and chairman of Argus; John Allen, CEO of Stelco; Raymond
Cyr, President of Bell Canada Enterprises; Peter Dobell, of Foreign Affairs
and Foreign Trade, in Ottawa; Marie-Jose Druin, Hudson Institute of Canada;
Claude Edwards, Public Staff Relations Board in Ottawa; Allan Gottlieb, former
Canadian Ambassador to the U.S.; David Henniger, Regional Director of Burns,
Fry; Senator Duff Roblin; Ron Sutherland, CEO of ATCO Ltd., William Turner,
of Montreal's PCC Industrial Corporation; and J.H. Warren, former Canadian
Ambassador to the U.S.
[And, of course, Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau was also in the habit of
frequently briefing meetings of David Rockefeller's Council on Foreign Relations
in Washington; and Lucien Bouchard, separatist PQ leader, was brought into
politics by Brian Mulroney, whose last act in Ottawa was to host a black-tie
dinner for 200 members of Rockefeller's Council of the Americas, who flew
up on Rockefeller's private jet to celebrate the successful negotiation of
NAFTA - another Rockefeller innovation]

"We shall have world government, whether or not we like it. The question
is only whether world government will be achieved by consent or by conquest."
-James R. Warburg (CFR)
"We are not going to achieve a new world order without paying for it in
blood as well as in words and money."
-Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., in "Foreign Affairs," July/August 1995.
"...In short, the 'house of world order' will have to be built from the
bottom up rather than from the top down. It will look like a great 'booming,
buzzing confusion,' to use William James' famous description of reality,
but an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will
accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault."
-Richard N. Gardner, in "Foreign Affairs," April 1974.
"The [Council on Foreign Relations] grew out of the Inquiry, a secretive
group of well-educated bankers and lawyers who accompanied Woodrow Wilson
to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. The council saw [as] its mandate the
calling of signals from the sidelines.... [T]he [elites] govern, while the
lowly men of elective office...dirty their hands with politics... The international
institutions conceived in 1945 -- the UN, the World Bank, and the International
Monetary Fund -- were anticipated in studies done at the council."
-New York Magazine, Oct. 7, 1996
"The Council on Foreign Relations is the American branch of a society which
originated in England in 1919 [and] believes national boundaries should be
obliterated and one-world rule established"
-Barry Goldwater
"...This regionalization is in keeping with the Tri-Lateral Plan which calls
for a gradual convergence of East and West, ultimately leading toward the
goal of "one world government.'...National sovereignty is no longer a viable
concept..."
-Zbigniew Brzezinski, National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter.
"Whatever the price of the Chinese Revolution, it has obviously succeeded
not only in producing more efficient and dedicated administration, but also
in fostering high morale and community of purpose.... The social experiment
in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and
successful in human history."
-David Rockefeller, 1973
by John K. Whitley, from the New World Order Intelligence Update's compilation
of Bilderberg articles:
[...]
Respected author Malachi Martin, who has top-level connections in the Vatican
and around the world, has written a number of interesting and revealing books
on international politics and the Roman Catholic church and Pontiff. In THE
KEYS OF THIS BLOOD, which centres on the life and connections of the present
Pope, Martin made this intriguing statement:
"Television commentator Bill Moyers found out during a fifteen-day, globe-spanning
trip in the company of David Rockefeller that 'just about a dozen or fifteen
individuals made day-to-day decisions that regulated the flow of capital
and goods throughout the entire world.'"
He quotes Bill Moyers himself as saying:
"David Rockefeller is the most conspicuous representative today of the ruling
class, a multinational fraternity of men who shape the global economy and
manage the flow of its capital. Rockefeller was born to it, and he has made
the most of it. But what some critics see as a vast international conspiracy,
he considers a circumstance of life and just another day's work... In the
world of David Rockefeller it's hard to tell where business ends and politics
begins."
from comminc@webaccess.net via Usenet:
"But this present window of opportunity, during which a truly peaceful and
interdependent world order might be built, will not be open for long. Already
there are powerful forces at work that threaten to destroy all of our hopes
and efforts to erect an enduring structure of global interdependence."
-David Rockefeller, speaking at the Business Council for the United Nations,
September 14, 1994.
The following statement by David Rockefeller indicates his understanding
of the need for businessmen to be politicians:
"....[I]n recent years, business leaders appear to have devoted themselves
to making more and more money, and find themselves with less and less time
to devote to civic and social responsibilities and to sinking roots in their
communities and showing their loyalty.
The danger, if this current self-serving behavior continues, is that the
voice of business will become more muted and the views of business more irrelevant
to the important issues of the day. We will find ourselves increasingly marginalized
and without the moral authority to demand a hearing from government or the
people.
"The profit motive provides the discipline for achievement, but individual
goals are formed by the larger society. Our achievements as business leaders
only have meaning and value if they embrace and mirror the needs and objectives
of the broader society."
from the Associated Press, 1999-Mar-15:
Trilateral Commission reaches out to others
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Trilateral Commission, long an exclusive club of influential
citizens from the world's most powerful nations, is reaching out to other
countries to help find ways to foster democracy and economic freedom.
While leading figures from nonmember countries like China, Korea, Russia
and Ukraine cannot become members of the commission, which meets annually
to discuss the future of the world, they sat at the table for this year's
meetings in Washington, which ended Monday.
``We have taken steps importantly to extend the range of the discussion
... to people outside the traditional trilateral areas,'' said former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, leader of the U.S. contingent in one of the
world's most prestigious gatherings. The commission, founded 26 years ago
by banker David Rockefeller, includes more than 300 mostly private citizens
from the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan.
Volcker, at a closing news conference that attracted only a handful of journalists,
said three days of discussions that involved about half the council's membership
reached no conclusions. Sessions are closed to news coverage, although security
is not tight and some media figures belong to the commission.
Membership includes academics and industrial and former political leaders.
Current members of national governments are excluded.
"The Trilateral Commission doesn't make any recommendations on anything,"
Volcker said - particularly not on reform of exchange rates or the world
financial system, which were among topics briefly discussed at the meeting.
Otto Graf Lambsdorff, European chairman and former German Bundestag member,
said China was the focus of much discussion, again with no consensus reached.
He said, however, that no one opposed cooperation with China and no one said
China should not respect human rights.
Volcker said the participation of representatives from several nonmember
countries enhanced the discussions and will continue at future annual sessions,
held alternatively in the United States, Japan and Europe.
``You have the opportunity of changing thinking,'' said Volcker, assessing
the value of the meetings. "I would hope that there is some kind of changing
in thinking, a convergence of thought, because people are affected by the
discussions, but it's not directed deliberately towards a particular end,
other than the fostering of democracy and economic development around the
world."
The Japanese commission chairman, Yotaro Kobayashi, head of Fuji Xerox Co.,
Ltd., said, `"Having more participants from outside ... has only enriched
the course of the discussions."

The Insiders
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Council on Foreign Relations
and the Trilateral Commission
Most Americans have never heard of these two organizations. But knowing
something about them is essential to understanding what has been going on
in America for several decades. So, let us examine, first, the Council on
Foreign Relations and then...the Trilateral Commission.
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)
The Council on Foreign Relations (7) was incorporated in 1921. It is a private
group which is headquartered at the corner of Park Avenue and 68th Street
in New York City, in a building given to the organization in 1929.
The CFR's founder, Edward Mandell House, had been the chief adviser of President
Woodrow Wilson. House was not only Wilson's most prominent aide, he actually
dominated the President. Woodrow Wilson referred to House as "my alter ego"
(my other self), and it is totally accurate to say that House, not Wilson,
was the most powerful individual in our nation during the Wilson Administration,
from 1913 until 1921.
Unfortunately for America, it is also true that Edward Mandell House was
a Marxist whose goal was to socialize the United States. In 1912 House wrote
the book, Philip Dru: Administrator; In it, he said he was working for "Socialism
as dreamed of by Karl Marx." The original edition of the book did not name
House as its author, but he made it clear in numerous ways that he indeed
was its creator.
In Philip Dru: Administrator, Edward Mandell House laid out a fictionalized
plan for the conquest of America. He told of a "conspiracy" (the word is
his) which would gain control of both the Democratic and Republican parties,
and use them as instruments in the creation of a socialistic world government.
The book called for passage of a graduated income tax and for the establishment
of a state-controlled central bank as steps toward the ultimate goal. Both
of these proposals are planks in The Communist Manifesto. And both became
law in 1913, during the very first year of the House-dominated Wilson Administration.
The House plan called for the United States to give up its sovereignty to
the League of Nations at the close of World War I. But when the U.S. Senate
refused to ratify America's entry into the League, Edward Mandell House's
drive toward world government was slowed down. Disappointed, but not beaten,
House and his friends then formed the Council on Foreign Relations, whose
purpose right from its inception was to destroy the freedom and independence
of the United States and lead our nation into a world government-if not through
the League of Nations, then through another world organization that would
be started after another world war. The control of that world government,
of course, was to be in the hands of House and like-minded individuals.
From its beginning in 1921, the CFR began to attract men of power and influence.
In the late 1920s, important financing for the CFR came from the Rockefeller
Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation. In 1940, at the invitation of President
Roosevelt, members of the CFR gained domination over the State Department,
and they have maintained that domination ever since.
By 1944, Edward Mandell House was deceased but his plan for taking control
of our nation's major political parties began to be realized. In 1944 and
in 1948, the Republican candidate for President, Thomas Dewey, was a CFR
member. In later years, the CFR could boast that Republicans Eisenhower and
Nixon were members, as were Democrats Stevenson, Kennedy, Humphrey, and McGovern.
The American people were told they had a choice when they voted for President.
But with precious few exceptions, Presidential candidates for decades have
been CFR members.
But the CFR's influence had also spread to other vital areas of American
life. Its members have run, or are running, NBC and CBS, the New York Times,
the Washington Post, the Des Moines Register, and many other important newspapers.
The leaders of Time, Life, Newsweek, Fortune, Business Week, and numerous
other publications are CFR members. The organization's members also dominate
the academic world, top corporations, the huge tax-exempt foundations, labor
unions, the military, and just about every segment of American life.
Let's look at the Council's Annual Report published in 1978. The organization's
membership list names 1,878 members, and the list reads like a Who's Who
in America. Eleven CFR members are U.S. senators; even more congressmen belong
to the organization. Sitting on top of this immensely powerful pyramid, as
Chairman of the Board, is David Rockefeller.
As can be seen in that CFR Annual Report, 284 of its members are U.S. government
officials. Any organization which can boast that 284 of its members are U.S.
government officials should be well-known. Yet most Americans have never
even heard of the Council on Foreign Relations.
One reason why this is so is that 171 journalists, correspondents and communications
executives are also CFR members, and they don't write about the organization.
In fact, CFR members rarely talk about the organization inasmuch as it is
an express condition of membership that any disclosure of what goes on at
CFR meetings shall be regarded as grounds for termination of membership.
...The CFR publishes a very informative quarterly journal called Foreign
Affairs. More often than not, important new shifts in U.S. policy or highly
indicative attitudes of political figures have been telegraphed in its pages.
When he was preparing to run for the Presidency in 1967, for instance Richard
Nixon made himself acceptable to the Insiders of the Establishment with an
article in the October 1967 issue of Foreign Affairs. (l4) In it, he called
for a new policy of openness toward Red China, a policy which he himself
later initiated in 1972.
The April 1974 issue of Foreign Affairs carried a very explicit recommendation
for carrying out the world-government scheme of CFR founder Edward Mandell
House. Authored by State Department veteran and Columbia University Professor
Richard N. Gardner (himself a CFR member), "The Hard Road to World Order"
admits that a single leap into world government via an organization like
the United Nations is unrealistic. (15)
Instead, Gardner urged the continued piecemeal delivery of our nation's
sovereignty to a variety of international organizations He called for an
end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece." That means
an end to our nation's sovereignty.
And he named as organizations to accomplish his goal the International Monetary
Fund, the World Bank, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Law
of the Sea Conference, the World Food Conference, the World Population Conference,
disarmament programs, and a United Nations military force. This approach,
Gardner said, "can produce some remarkable concessions of sovereignty that
could not be achieved on an across-the-board basis."
Richard Gardner's preference for destroying the freedom and independence
of the United States in favor of the CFR's goal of world government thoroughly
dominates top circles in our nation today. The men who would scrap our nation's
Constitution are praised as "progressives" and "far-sighted thinkers." The
only question that remains among these powerful Insiders is which method
to use to carry out their treasonous plan.
The Trilateral Commission
Unfortunately, the Council on Foreign Relations is not the only group proposing
an end to the sovereignty of the United States. In 1973, another organization
which now thoroughly dominates the Carter Administration first saw the light
of day. Also based in New York City, this one is called the Trilateral Commission.
The Trilateral Commission's roots stem from the book Between Two Ages (16)
written by Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1970. The following quotations from that
book show how closely Brzezinski's thinking parallels that of CFR founder
Edward Mandell House.
On page 72, Brzezinski writes: "Marxism is simultaneously a victory of the
external, active man over the inner, passive man and a victory of reason
over belief."
On page 83, he states: "Marxism, disseminated on the popular level in the
form of Communism, represented a major advance in man's ability to conceptualize
his relationship to his world."
And on page 123, we find: "Marxism supplied the best available insight into
contemporary reality."
Nowhere does Mr. Brzezinski tell his readers that the Marxism "in the form
of Communism," which he praises, has been responsible for the murder of approximately
100 million human beings in the Twentieth Century, has brought about the
enslavement of over a billion more, and has caused want, privation and despair
for all but the few criminals who run the communist-dominated nations.
On page 198, after discussing America's shortcomings, Brzezinski writes:
"America is undergoing a new revolution" which "unmasks its obsolescence."
We disagree; America is not becoming obsolete.
On page 260, he proposes "Deliberate management of the American future...with
the...planner as the key social legislator and manipulator." The central
planning he wants for our country is a cardinal underpinning of communism
and the opposite of the way things are done in a free country.
On page 296, Mr. Brzezinski suggests piecemeal "Movement toward a larger
community of the developed nations...through a variety of indirect ties and
already developing limitations on national sovereignty." Here, we have the
same proposal that has been offered by Richard Gardner in the CFR publication
Foreign Affairs.
Brzezinski then calls for the forging of community links among the United
States, Western Europe, and Japan; and the extension of these links to more
advanced communist countries. Finally, on page 308 of his 309-page hook,
he lets us know that what he really wants is "the goal of world government".
A Meeting of Minds
Zbigniew Brzezinski's Between Two Ages was published in 1970 while he was
a professor in New York City. What happened, quite simply, is that David
Rockefeller read the book. And, in 1973, Mr. Rockefeller launched the new
Trilateral Commission whose purposes include linking North America, Western
Europe, and Japan "in their economic relations, their political and defense
relations, their relations with developing countries, and their relations
with communist countries." (l7)
The original literature of the Trilateral Commission also states, exactly
as Brzezinski's book had proposed, that the more advanced communist states
could become partners in the alliance leading to world government. In short,
David Rockefeller implemented Brzezinski's proposal. The only change was
the addition of Canada, so that the Trilateral Commission presently includes
members from North America, Western Europe, and Japan, not just the United
States, Western Europe, and Japan.
Then, David Rockefeller hired Zbigniew Brzezinski away from Columbia University
and appointed him to be the Director of the Trilateral Commission.
...As with the CFR, we do not believe that every member of the Trilateral
Commission is fully committed to the destruction of the United States. Some
of these men actually believe that the world would be a better place if the
United States would give up its independence in the interests of world government.
Others go along for the ride, a ride which means a ticket to fame, comfortable
living, and constant flattery. Some, of course, really do run things and
really do want to scrap our nation's independence.
What It All Means
...The Council on Foreign Relations was conceived by
a Marxist, Edward Mandell House, for the purpose of creating a one-world
government by destroying the freedom and independence of all nations, especially
including our own. Its Chairman of the Board is David Rockefeller. And its
members have immense control over our government and much of American life.
The Trilateral Commission was conceived by Zbigniew Brzezinski, who praises
Marxism, who thinks the United States is becoming obsolete, and who also
wants to create a one-world government. Its founder and driving force is
also David Rockefeller. And it, too, exercises extraordinary control over
the government of the United States.
The effect of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission
on the affairs of our nation is easy to see. Our own government no longer
acts in its own interest; we no longer win any wars we fight; and we constantly
tie ourselves to international agreements, pacts and conventions.
From the November 25, 1996 issue of The New American:
To many in C-SPAN's television audience, the October 11th broadcast of the
Council on Foreign Relation's colloquium on terrorism may have seemed to
provide a timely and informed focus on one of the most pressing security
concerns of our day. However, for those familiar with the CFR's globalist
agenda and its long history of supporting and legitimizing terrorist regimes
and organizations (not to mention sanitizing individual terrorist leaders),
the conference was about as believable as a professional wrestling match.
The analogy is especially apropos when considering "main events" such as
the Council's C-SPAN confab entitled "Combating Terrorism: What Works? What
Doesn't?" To a foreigner or a visitor from another planet who has never seen
a professional wrestling match before, the bizarre behemoths in the ring
with their bulging musculature and raging rodomontades are impressive indeed
- on first sight. It doesn't take a cerebral titan, though, to soon realize
that this is all show, and that Hulk Hogan, Jake the Snake, the Undertaker,
and the rest of the mastodons of the All-Star Wrestling steroid menagerie,
take their falls and their wins according to script. After witnessing a few
dozen such rigged spectacles, even the most mentally challenged of fans knows
he is watching a farce.
Foreign Relations Charade
The CFR's terrorism palaver was just such a farce. Broadcast from Washington
DC's Grand Hyatt Hotel, the program featured a lineup of participants calculated
to awe the uninitiated. Adorned with impressive resumés boasting service
in high government posts and other key centers of power, these were obvious
heavyweight contenders. And while they did engage (albeit sedately) in occasional
verbal sparring amongst themselves, it was clear to the discerning that their
intellectual muscle flexing was aimed primarily at convincing the American
public that this "diverse" representation of the Council's expertise was
united in a determination to help formulate and implement measures that are
tough on terrorists and yet still compatible with liberty.
Kicking off this ostentatious affair was Council on Foreign Relations president
Leslie Gelb, who is as improbable a champion of national security as we are
likely to find. Those who remember the Vietnam War may also recall Mr. Gelb's
role in the publication of the top-secret Pentagon Papers, one of the most
far-reaching security breaches in U.S. history. That treachery took place
while Gelb served as a "whiz kid" in the Defense Department under Robert
S. McNamara (CFR). Implicated with Gelb in this infamous leak were Daniel
Ellsberg, Morton Halperin, Paul Warnke, and Richard J. Barnet, CFR members
all. They were (and are) all ultra left-wing extremists, openly associated
with the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), the notorious Marxist think
tank with long-established connections to the Soviet KGB and Cuban DGI.
CFR members Cora Weiss and Richard Barnet were among the many IPS officials
who made the Jane Fonda-Tom Hayden pilgrimage to Hanoi and assisted the North
Vietnamese Communist government. It was IPS director Richard Barnet who delivered
the Pentagon Papers to the CFR-dominated New York Times and Washington Post.
And it was thanks to the collusion of Chief Judge Henry J. Friendly (CFR)
and Judge David Bazelon (IPS), presiding respectively over the appeals of
the Times and the Post, that the federal injunction against printing the
sensitive documents - including secret codes - was lifted.
This CFR/IPS symbiosis continues to the present and has been especially
noteworthy for its destructive impact on U.S. intelligence and national security,
and for the tremendous assistance it has provided to the terrorist organizations
whose work the CFR supposedly opposes. Mr. Gelb, whose sterling vita includes
stints at the Brookings Institution, the Carnegie Endowment, and the New
York Times, once asserted that the radically subversive IPS is "one of three
preeminent centers for foreign policy perspectives." Presumably, one of the
other two "preeminent centers" is the CFR, which described itself in literature
for the program as "a nonprofit, nonpartisan membership organization, dedicated
to improving the understanding of U.S. foreign policy and international affairs
through the exchange of ideas."
Such modesty. Washington Post ombudsman Richard Harwood has more accurately
described the CFR as "the nearest thing we have to a ruling establishment
in the United States." Sociologist C. Wright Mills referred to its membership
as "the American power elite." The late Admiral Chester Ward, who was himself
a CFR member for 16 years before becoming a staunch critic of the organization,
charged that the CFR's leaders were a bunch of "one-world global-government
ideologists" committed to "promoting disarmament and submergence of U.S.
sovereignty and independence into an all-powerful one-world government."
Certainly none can deny that the Council's more than 3,000 members hold unparalleled
influence over the executive branch of the federal government (starting at
the White House with CFR member Bill Clinton), the national media, and much
of the corporate, financial, and philanthropic worlds. Knowledgeable observers
of American power politics understand full well that it is the Harold Pratt
House (CFR headquarters in New York), not the White House, which is the center
of U.S. political power.
Gelb's accession to the CFR presidency helps to illustrate the reach and
workings of the Council's power network. Gelb replaced Peter Tarnoff as the
top executive at Pratt House, while Tarnoff took the job as assistant to
Secretary of State Warren Christopher (former CFR vice chairman).
Panel of "Experts"
At the October 11th CFR exhibition at DC's Grand Hyatt, after a brief introduction
on the need "to cope with the problem of terrorism with bluster, ideology,
and politics aside," Gelb turned the show over to Dave McCurdy (CFR), chairman
of the Council's Policy Impact Panel on Terrorism. A seven-term, ultra-liberal
congressman from Oklahoma, McCurdy was defeated in his 1994 run for the U.S.
Senate by conservative Representative James Inhofe. Joining McCurdy on the
panel were Kenneth L. Adelman (CFR), former director of the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency, and Nadine Strossen (CFR), national president of
the American Civil Liberties Union and professor of law at the New York Law
School.
The five "expert witnesses" speaking before the CFR panel were: Brian Jenkins,
former Rand Corp. associate and deputy chairman of Kroll Associates (a CFR
corporate member); L. Paul Bremer III (CFR), former Ambassador-at-Large for
Counter Terrorism and managing director of Kissinger Associates; Shibley
Telhami (CFR), associate professor of government and director of Near Eastern
Studies at Cornell University; Wolfgang H. Reinicke, senior research staff
member at the liberal-left Brookings Institution; and Jamie S. Gorelick,
U.S. Deputy Attorney General.
Considering the CFR sponsorship of the symposium and the overwhelming representation
of the Council's membership among the formal participants, it was certain
that the "consensus" of the esteemed experts would reflect the official CFR
line. A central theme of that orchestrated consensus which forms the substrate
of all conceptual thinking and policy decision-making with regard to foreign
policy and national security is the tiresome - and utterly false - refrain
that "Communism is dead." Repeated references were made to the "collapse
of the Soviet Union" and "the end of the bipolar structure of the international
system."
CFR policy elites in government, academe, industry, and the media have been
the primary apostles responsible for the near total acceptance of this false
gospel today. Take, for example, Dave McCurdy's article "The Evolving U.S.
Policy Toward Ukraine," published in the Winter-Spring 1994 issue of SAIS
Review, journal of the School of Advanced International Studies at John Hopkins
University. According to McCurdy, the people of Ukraine have "severed their
bonds to the former USSR and embarked on a risky journey toward self-determination
and freedom for the first time in generations. The steward of this new ship
of state is Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk.... Kravchuk is an ardent
Ukrainian nationalist, dedicated to the survival of his country, but he has
proved himself a moderate as well."
McCurdy's assertions are completely absurd and a puerile parroting of Soviet
strategic deception. The false "independence" of Ukraine and the other "independent
republics" is as patently fraudulent as Kravchuk's "nationalism." Kravchuk
- like his successor, Kuchma - is a lifelong communist who participated for
decades in the totalitarian subjugation of his people and is today playing
the role of "moderate" while maintaining an iron grip on the Soviet police
state system which is, in reality, still very much a part of the "collapsed
USSR." Comrades Yeltsin and Kravchuk are more than willing to allow McCurdy
and his CFR associates to devise plans to send them billions of American
taxpayer dollars in aid to promote "reform" and "stability." Having Americans
pay for our own destruction even as we celebrate "winning the Cold War" is
the ultimate in sweet irony for the Soviet strategists. And the CFR elites
are leading us headlong in a mad rush toward that destruction.
An essential part of that strategic deception involves the continued covert
Soviet sponsorship of terrorism worldwide. During the 1960s and '70s, as
international terrorism spread its global carnage, the CFR "wise men" challenged
the charges that the Soviet Union, acting through its surrogates in Eastern
Europe, Cuba, Syria, Iraq, and Libya, was behind the havoc. When the evidence
became overwhelming, the CFR "conservatives" acknowledged the Soviet hand
in the global terrorist scourge while the CFR "liberals" remained in denial.
Readers may recall that it was Warren Christopher's (CFR) "diplomacy" under
President Carter that brought about the overthrow of two of America's strongest
allies, the Shah of Iran and President Somoza of Nicaragua, and the installation
of the terrorist regimes under Ayatollah Khomeini and the Sandanistas, respectively,
in those countries.
During the Reagan years, Secretary of State George Shultz (CFR) made moves
to recognize Yasser Arafat and even sent ships to rescue Arafat and his Soviet-supplied
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) henchmen when they were trapped in
Lebanon and facing annihilation by Israel and rival groups. Arafat's closest
friend and the PLO's intelligence chief, Hani el-Hassan, was for many years
an agent for Nicolai Ceausescu's DIE, which operated under direction of the
Soviet KGB. Under the close supervision of Soviet agents Alexander Soldatov
and Vladimir Buljakov, Arafat's PLO became the Kremlin's premier terrorist
organization against the Free World.
But using the same phony "break with the past" deception strategy employed
to sell Gorbachev, Yeltsin, Kravchuk, et al to a gullible West, Arafat has
joined the ranks of "former" terrorists who have been anointed as national
leaders by the CFR ruling elites. Like Nelson Mandela and Jean Bertrand Aristide,
he has ridden the terrorist road to power and has received the same royal
treatment from the Pratt House cabal.
Good Cop, Bad Cop
Current mythology has it that "pragmatic," "moderate" Arafat is beset by
the radical Hamas, over which he has no control. In reality, as Christopher
Story has aptly noted in his newsletter Soviet Analyst, "Hamas (and its subdivisions)
is and always has been an integral component of the umbrella organization
known as the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which reports directly
to Moscow." Additional support for that view came last year when Hamas official
Mousa Abu Marzook and his wife were arrested in New York at JFK Airport.
Marzook's address book contained the private telephone numbers of Yasser Arafat,
George Habash, and other Marxist terrorists with whom this "fundamentalist"
is supposedly in deadly conflict. Earlier this year, Arafat put on a show
of searching for Hamas military chief Mohammed Dief. Arafat's man assigned
to head the unsuccessful "search," Colonel Mohammed Dahlan, a childhood friend
of Dief, was seen sipping coffee with the "fugitive" terrorist supervisor.
Arafat and his Moscow handlers are employing the classic "good cop, bad
cop" tactic. That became all the more obvious on January 9th of this year
when Boris Yeltsin elevated top Soviet intelligence chief Yevgeny Primakov
to the post of Foreign Minister. As one of the KGB's top Arabists, Primakov
has long been associated with the terrorist regimes of Iraq and Syria and
was Moscow's primary paymaster to Arafat's PLO and Habash's PFLP. These facts,
of course, are censored in the delusional drivelings of the CFR media cartel,
where Primakov is presented as one of Russia's "progressives." Thus, when
Boris Yeltsin held Arafat's hand high in the air at the "anti-terrorism"
summit at Sharm El Sheik on March 13th this year and proclaimed that they
were joining the leaders from 27 other countries in a pledge "to work together
against terrorism," the prostitute CFR press greeted the obvious lie with
euphoric huzzahs.
Every mention of the sacrosanct "Middle East Peace Process" at the CFR confab
also required a ritual genuflection from all concerned. And why not? The
whole process has been a CFR creation. The chief "negotiator" (read: arm
twister) for the affair has been (who else) Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
Heading up Christopher's Mideast negotiating team are: Assistant Secretary
of State for Near East Affairs Edward Djerejian, Special Middle East Coordinator
Dennis Ross, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs
Dan Kurtzer, all members of the CFR. These and other State Department participants
have been regulars at CFR meetings over the past two years, where members
receive privy information on the secret negotiations.
This relationship between the official and private policy elites at the
CFR was taken to new highs (or lows) when the Council, together with the
World Economic Forum, sponsored the first-ever Middle East-North Africa (MENA)
Economic Summit at Casablanca, Morocco in October 1994. The glorious soiree
at the Royal Palace of King Hassan II constituted a veritable "Who's Who"
of global political and business elites, and was used to further sanctify
Arafat and to set in motion plans for a Common Market for the Middle East.
Of course, U.S. tax dollars and U.S. troops and armaments will guarantee
this venture.
Subsidizing Saddam
During the Presidency of George Bush (CFR), Saddam Hussein, everyone's favorite
terrorist scapegoat, was the secret recipient of incredible military aid
from the United States. Investigations by the House Banking Committee and
various journalists have amply documented an amazing trail of treachery and
treasonous actions by Bush and his one-world retinue before, during, and
after the Persian Gulf War. This sordid affair has been comprehensively exposed
in two books: Spider's Web: The Secret History of How the White House Illegally
Armed Iraq, by Alan Friedman of the Financial Times of London (1994, Bantam);
and Shell Game, by Peter Mantius (1995, St. Martin's Press). The evidence
is clear that the U.S. assisted Iraq in obtaining cluster bombs, technology
for nuclear enrichment, U.S.-designed munitions, missile technology, some
$5 billion in loan guarantees, and much more, in spite of Saddam's open hatred
of the U.S. and his wanton use of poison gas against his own civilian population.
When the shooting started in Operation Desert Storm, President Bush's CFR
coterie had us bedding down with Assad of Syria, Saddam's rival for the title
of "Maximum Terrorist Leader." That has carried over into the present Administration,
naturally, with President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher
going to fantastic lengths to coddle Assad, who still hosts an unimaginable
menagerie of terrorist groups.
Soviet Legal Aid
All participants in the CFR's Policy Impact Panel were in agreement that
"better intelligence" is essential to effectively cope with the terrorist
threat. This, of course, is laughable in view of the enormous destructive
campaign waged by top CFR members and the communist subversives they have
promoted, supported, and protected against America's internal security organs
and our legitimate intelligence interests.
The inclusion of the ACLU's Nadine Strossen as one of the CFR panel's three
members is itself evidence of the Council's transparent hypocrisy. The Communist
Party itself could not come close to accomplishing for the Kremlin what the
closet Reds in the ACLU and their dupes have achieved. Since its inception
in the early years of this century, the ACLU has led the revolutionary vanguard
in attacking all police and intelligence agencies and providing assistance
to communists, anarchists, terrorists, and subversives of every stripe, virtually
without exception. Besides longtime executive director and founder Roger
Baldwin, other Communist Party members of the organization's original executive
board included William Z. Foster, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and Louis Budenz.
Although the ACLU has attempted to portray itself as a mainstream champion
of constitutional rights, it remains one of the most radical and subversive
organizations in America today. Together with the Institute for Policy Studies
and the National Lawyers Guild, the ACLU has spun an immense web of anti-police
and anti-intelligence organizations which have worked closely with assets
of the Soviet KGB and other communist intelligence agencies to foment revolution
and render America blind to the forces which plot her destruction.
The Halperin Record
The CFR has had more than its share of Soviet spies and communist agents.
Alger Hiss, Viginius Coe, Noel Field, Nathan Silvermaster, Victor Perlo,
Harry Dexter White, and Soloman Adler are but a few of the notorious CFR
Reds who have done real harm to our nation. More recently the Council has
been able to boast among its membership such militant Marxists as Morton
Halperin, Cora Weiss, Richard Barnet, and Daniel Ellsberg. The efforts of
prominent Council members in the 1993 campaign to install the radical Halperin
as President Clinton's Assistant Secretary of Defense established another
benchmark in the CFR's subversion tally.
As an ACLU staff member and chairman of the Campaign to Stop Government
Spying, Halperin worked closely with Frank Wilkinson, Frank Donner, and other
militant Communist Party members to undermine American security. Halperin
helped raise funds for the Socialist Workers Party's (SWP) lawsuits against
the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. The SWP is a Trotskyite terrorist
organization of the Communist Fourth International. When CIA traitor and
self-professed communist Phillip Agee needed a lawyer, Comrade Mort flew
to England to represent him. Those are but a few highlights from Halperin's
"distinguished" career which commended him for one of the most sensitive
security offices in the Clinton Administration. At least that is what CFR
Vice President Alton Frye apparently thought. Frye and CFR members Jeremy
Stone and Arnold Kanter sent out a letter to their one-world brethren in
defense of Halperin's beleaguered nomination. Halperin is now a "senior fellow"
on the staff of the CFR.
Phony Concern
Striking the pose of guardian of the Constitution - a familiar guise of
ACLU radicals - Nadine Strossen proclaimed to the panel and C-SPAN audience
that her "central concern here is that whatever steps we take to combat terrorism
do not compromise our fundamental rights." That must have been reassuring
to many who have been watching with mounting concern over the past year and
a half as the President and Congress have utilized every real and alleged
terrorist threat as an excuse to centralize more police powers in Washington.
But the ACLU has been cloaking its Bolshevism under a banner of patriotism
since its very inception. It was Roger Baldwin himself who advised Louis
Lochner of the communist People's Council in a letter back in August 1917:
Do steer away from making it [the People's Council] look like a Socialist
enterprise. Too many people have already gotten the idea that it is nine-tenths
a Socialist movement....
We want also to look like patriots in everything we do. We want to get a
lot of good flags, talk a good deal about the Constitution and what our forefathers
wanted to make of this country, and to show that we are the folks that really
stand for the spirit of our institutions.
This same revered ACLU icon later said, "I am for socialism, disarmament,
and, ultimately, for abolishing the state itself.... I seek the social ownership
of property, the abolition of the propertied class, and the sole control
of those who produce wealth. Communism is the goal." Comrade Baldwin's successors
at the ACLU helm have never been as candid, but they have always shown unmistakably
by their actions that their goal is the same.
The ACLU and its IPS network, with the protective cover it has received
from the CFR-led media and the funding it has received from the CFR-dominated
tax-exempt foundations, have for decades been carrying out a relentless attack
on America's ability to defend itself against terrorism. This same collectivist
cabal has been simultaneously "transforming" the world's most infamous terrorists
and their even more nefarious sponsors into paragons of blissful harmony
and peace. Such fiendish alchemy cannot continue forever. Unless this dangerous
diabolism is exposed - and soon - America is certain to reap a terrorist
whirlwind of apocalyptic proportions.

[Ed's note: Elizabeth Gurley Flynn was imprisoned under the Smith Act read The Rebel Girl: An Autobiography by Elizabeth Gurley Flynn ©1955 International Publishers New York for what her life was like as an activist and a political prisoner who was taken away from her family in New York to West Virginia for several years after she was convicted under this Act; no Council of Foreign Relations member has ever been imprisoned to my knowledge; Alger Hiss was imprisoned also under questionable circumstances as he maintained his innocence throughout his life. Mr. Hiss and his new wife lived next door to me at 157 East 18th Street, New York, NY 10003 in a one bedroom apartment that was rent controlled, far different from the luxury of Henry Kissinger or David Rockefeller who are the real criminals. Mr. Hiss and his wife did own a dwelling in the Hamptons on Long Island which I never saw but it is my understanding that Mr. Hiss sold pencils when he finally was released from prison; Frank Wilkinson's life has been attempted many times. That he has survived is a miracle. I find it very strange that these people should be named by the forgoing author as these people would seem to be reputable.]
