What is the real agenda?
-
Why is the obama Regime so desperate to
commit a war crime despite the warnings delivered to the White House
Fool two days ago by the most important countries in the world at
the G20 Summit?
-
What powerful interest is pushing the
White House Fool to act outside of law, outside the will of the
American people, outside the warnings of the world community?
The
obama Regime has admitted, as UK
prime minister david cameron had to admit, that no one has any
conclusive evidence that the Assad government in Syria used chemical
weapons.
Nevertheless, obama has sent the despicable
john kerry out to convince the public and Congress on the basis of
videos that Assad used chemical weapons against his own people.
What the videos show are dead and suffering people. The videos do not show
who did it. The obama Regimes case is nonexistent. It rests on nothing that
indicates responsibility. The obama Regimes case is nothing but an
unsubstantiated allegation.
What kind of depraved person would take the world to war based on nothing
whatsoever but an unsubstantiated allegation?
The worlds two worse liars, obama and kerry, say Assad did it, but they
admit that they cannot prove it. It is what they want to believe, because
they want it to be true. The lie serves their undeclared agenda.
If obama and kerry were to tell the public the real reasons they want to
attack Syria, they would be removed from office.
The entire world is teetering on a war, the consequences of which are
unknown, for no other reason than two people, devoid of all integrity who
lack the intelligence and humanity to be in high office, are determined to
serve a tiny collection of warmongers consisting of the crazed, murderous
Israeli government and their Muslim-hating neoconservative agents, who
comprise a fifth column inside the obama Regime.
The Russian government has given evidence to the UN that conclusively proves
that
the al-Nusra, al-Qaeda affiliated invaders
are responsible for the attack.
There is also conclusive proof that the rebels
have chemical weapons.
In addition, a highly regarded journalist has
reported, using direct quotes and the names of al-Nusra fighters, that the
chemical weapons were given to al-Nusra by Saudi Arabia without proper
handling instructions, and that an accidental explosion occurred before al-Nusra
could use the Saudi-supplied weapons to frame-up the Assad government.
However the deaths were caused, they are unfortunate, but no more so that
the deaths that obama has caused in,
-
Iraq
-
Afghanistan
-
Libya
-
Somalia
-
Pakistan
-
Yemen
-
Egypt
-
Syria
The proven deaths for which obama is responsible
are many times the unproven deaths that obama attributes without evidence to
Assad.
The indisputable fact is that Syrian deaths occur only because Washington
initiated the invasion of Syria by external forces similar to the ones that
Washington used against Libya.
However the deaths occurred, the deaths are the
doings of the criminal obama Regime. Without the criminal obama Regime
seeking the overthrow of the Syrian government, there would be no deaths by
chemical weapons or by any other means.
This was a war initiated by,
Assad did not start the war. The Syrian
government was attacked by outside forces sent in by Washington and Israel.
Assad has much higher public support in Syria than,
The White House Fool keeps repeating his
nonsensical statement, as if the Fool is a wound-up talking doll, that
Assads unproven use of chemical weapons is a threat to 'global security'.
Dear reader, who besides the White House Fool is so unbelievably stupid
as to believe that Syria is a threat to 'world security'?
If,
-
Syria is a threat to world security
-
like Iraq was a threat to world
security
-
like Iran is alleged to be a threat to
world security,
...what kind of superpower is the United States?
How low does the IQ have to be, how mentally
impaired does the public have to be to fall for these absurd hysterical
allegations?
Lets turn obamas claim upon the Fool. Why isnt it a threat to global
security for obama to attack Syria? There is no authority for obama to
attack Syria just because he wants to and just because he has demonized
Assad with endless lies and just because obama is the total puppet of the
crazed Israeli government and his neoconservative national security advisor,
in effect an Israeli agent, and just because the Ministry of Propaganda,
including NPR, repeats every obama lie as if it were the truth.
Isnt it a threat to international security when a superpower can, acting on
a whim, demonize a leader and a country and unleash mass destruction, as the
US has done seven times in the past twelve years?
There are millions of innocent but demonized
victims of the indispensable, exceptional USA, the light unto the world.
Forget about
the U.S. media, which is nothing but a
propaganda ministry for the Israel Lobby. What the members of Congress and
what the American people need to ask obama is why does the White House only
represent the Israel Lobby?
No one supports an attack on Syria but the Israel Lobby.
-
Why is obama going to add yet another
war crime to Washingtons 12-year record?
-
Wasnt it enough to destroy the lives
and prospects of millions of people in,
-
Afghanistan
-
Iraq
-
Libya
-
Somalia
-
Pakistan
-
Yemen
-
Egypt?
-
Why kill and destroy the life prospects
of yet more millions of people in Syria and other countries into
which obamas war could spread?
Maybe the answer is that obama, kerry,
and the crazed netanyahu and his neoconservative fifth column
are zombies...
