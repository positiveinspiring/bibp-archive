1763
The British during the French-Indian
War. The Native Americans greatly outnumbered the British and
were suspected of being on the side of the French. As an "act of
good will" the British give blankets to the Indians, but the
blankets came from a hospital that was treating smallpox victims
and consequently smallpox raged through the Native American
community and devastated their numbers.

1814
Andrew Jackson, whose portrait
appears on the U.S. $20 bill today, supervised the mutilation of
800 or more Creek Indian corpses, the bodies of men, women and
children that his troops had massacred, cutting off their noses
to count and preserve a record of the dead, slicing long strips
of flesh from their bodies to tan and turn into bridle reins.

1911
Turkey established gun control. From
1915-1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves,
were rounded up and exterminated.
-
1918
The modern history of Biological
Warfare (BW) starts in 1918 with the Japanese formation of a
special section of the Army (Unit 731) dedicated to BW. The
thought at the time was "Science and Technology are the Key's to
Winning War and BW is the most cost effective."

1918-1919
Flu pandemic that killed over 20
million worldwide and over 500,000 here in the US.
-
1920's
Unlike the malignant twists of
nature, ranging from bubonic plague through to potato blight,
which have killed masses throughout the ages, both the beef and
pituitary hormone CJD crises were manmade. Scrapie, the sheep
equivalent of BSE and CJD, has been around for more than two
centuries. Somewhat differently, human spongiform encephalopathy
was unheard of before two German physicians, Creutzfeldt and
Jakob, independently reported the initial cases in the 1920s.
BSE, too, was unheard of until a decade after cattle (aka Mad
Cow) began to be fed the protein-rich remains of scrapie-infected
sheep to accelerate their growth.
-
1929
The Soviet Union established gun
control. From 1929 to 1953, approximately 20 million dissidents,
unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
-
1930's
Less known to the public is that
fluoride also accumulates in bones. "The teeth are windows to
what's happening in the bones," explained Paul Connett,
Professor of Chemistry at St Lawrence University, New York, to
these reporters. In recent years, pediatric bone specialists
have expressed alarm about an increase in stress fractures among
young people in the US. Connett and other scientists are
concerned that fluoride-linked to bone damage in studies since
the 1930s-may be a contributing factor.
-
1931
Japan expanded its territory by
taking over part of Manchuria and Unit 731 moved in to secure
"an endless supply of human experiment materials." Essentially
all prisoners of war were available for Biological Warfare (BW)
experiments.

1931
Dr. Cornelius Rhoads, under the
auspices of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical
Investigations, infects human subjects with cancer cells. He
later goes on to establish the U.S. Army Biological Warfare
facilities in Maryland, Utah, and Panama, and is named to the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. While there, he begins a series
of
radiation exposure experiments on American
soldiers and civilian hospital patients.
-
1932
The Infamous Tuskegee Study
In recent history, we have seen the influence of occult
population control advocates here in America. Nowhere is that
influence better demonstrated than in
the Tuskegee Study, a
scientific research program in which 400 syphilis-infected black
men were recruited by the U.S. Public Health Service back in
1932. The participants were all told that they would be treated
for their infections, but instead of treating their illness, all
medicines were withheld. The black men were then actively
prevented from obtaining treatment elsewhere as their bodies,
and the bodies of their wives and children, were systematically
ravaged by disease.
The evil men who conceived that
Nazi-style study justified their atrocity by alleging that
scientists needed to learn how untreated syphilis progressed in
the human body. For a period of forty years, between 1932 and
1972, the genocidal Tuskegee Study continued. It was not until
1972, when one newspaper finally had the courage to break the
story to the public, that the Tuskegee Study was finally
terminated.
The Population Control Agenda
-
1934
The original lesson about the
infectious nature of these brain diseases ("mad cow disease" or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans) came from a 1934
vaccine catastrophe in the UK which brought scrapie, or "mad
sheep disease", to almost 5,000 out of 18,000 lambs within two
years of their immunization against louping-ill virus infection.
Tracing back, scientists discovered
that the vaccine serum was prepared from a number of lambs whose
dams had subsequently developed scrapie, but the significance of
scrapie passing vertically from ewes to their lambs, and
horizontally from lamb to lamb by virtue of the vaccine
injections, was kept from international eyes by a series of
egotistical carry-ons which prevented the data from reaching the
pages of the scientific literature for a further 15 years.
-
1935
The Pellagra Incident. After
millions of individuals die from Pellagra over a span of two
decades, the U.S. Public Health Service finally acts to stem the
disease. The director of the agency admits it had known for at
least 20 years that Pellagra is caused by a niacin deficiency
but failed to act since most of the deaths occurred within
poverty-stricken black populations.
-
1935
China established gun control. From
1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend
themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
-
1938
Germany established gun control in
1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 6 to 7 million Jews, gypsies,
homosexuals, the mentally ill, and 12 million Christians who
were unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and
exterminated.
-
1939
Margaret Sanger organized her "Negro
project," a program designed to eliminate members of what she
believed to be an "inferior race." Margaret Sanger justified her
proposal because she believed that:
-
"The masses of Negroes
...particularly in the South, still breed carelessly and
disastrously, with the result that the increase among
Negroes, even more than among whites, is from that portion
of the population least intelligent and fit..."
-
1940
Four hundred prisoners in Chicago
are infected with Malaria in order to study the effects of new
and experimental drugs to combat the disease. Nazi doctors later
on trial at Nuremberg cite this American study to defend their
own actions during the Holocaust.
-
1941
Japanese planes sprayed bubonic
plague over parts of China. At least 5 separate instances of
this occurring have been documented. In 1942 "bacterial bombs"
were deployed on mainland China but these attacks were
determined to be ineffective.
-
1942
The United States (US) becomes aware
of the Japanese efforts in Biological Warfare (BW) and decided
to start its own program. These acts were not the only
atrocities committed, however. The Japanese released thousands
of plague infested rats prior to their surrender, with unknown
consequences. They also tested on American POW's during the war
and the U.S. Government apparently knew about it, but did
nothing (perhaps a worse atrocity). These people killed over
3000 POWs, including many Americans, in a variety of grisly
experiments. What they did instead was to offer immunity to
would-be war criminals in exchange for the information the
Japanese learned from these experiments!
-
1942
Chemical Warfare Services begins
mustard gas experiments on approximately 4,000 servicemen. The
experiments continue until 1945 and made use of Seventh Day
Adventists who chose to become human guinea pigs rather than
serve on active duty.
-
1942
Great Britain was also developing a
program in Biological Warfare (BW). The program focused on
anthrax spores and their viability and "range of spread" when
delivered with a conventional bomb. The fateful Gruinard Island
off the coast of Scotland was chosen as the site for this
testing. It was thought that it was far enough off the coast as
too prevent any contamination of the mainland, which later
turned out to be false. The data gathered from these experiments
was used by both Great Britain and the U.S. to develop bombs
that were better able to effectively disperse spores.
-
1943
After an outbreak of anthrax in
sheep and cattle in 1943 on the coast of Scotland that directly
faced Gruinard, the British decided to stop testing. A tragic
consequence of this testing is that even today Gruinard Island
is contaminated with Bacillus anthracis spores. The original
idea for decontamination was to start a brushfire that burned
off the top of the soil and killed all traces of the organisms.
Unfortunately, the spores unexpectedly embedded themselves in
the soil so total decontamination of the island was/is
impossible. As long as no ground is disturbed, we are supposedly
safe, but birds that travel back and forth from mainland to
island probably don't know this!
-
1943
Planning began in 1943 with the
appointment of a special New York State Health Department
committee to study the advisability of adding fluoride to
Newburgh's drinking water. The chairman of the committee was,
again, Dr Harold C. Hodge, then chief of fluoride toxicity
studies for the Manhattan Project. Subsequent members of the
committee included Henry L. Barnett, a captain in the Project's
Medical Section, and John W. Fertig, in 1944 with the Office of
Scientific Research and Development-the super-secret Pentagon
group which sired the Manhattan Project.
Their military affiliations were
kept secret. Hodge was described as a pharmacologist, Barnett as
a pediatrician. Placed in charge of the Newburgh project was
David B. Ast, chief dental officer of the New York State Health
Department. Ast had participated in a key secret wartime
conference on fluoride, held by the Manhattan Project in January
1944, and later worked with Dr Hodge on the Project's
investigation of human injury in the New Jersey incident,
according to once-secret memos.
-
1944
A Manhattan Project memorandum of 29
April 1944 states:
The memo, from a captain in the
medical corps, is stamped SECRET and is addressed to Colonel
Stafford Warren, head of the Manhattan Project's Medical
Section. Colonel Warren is asked to approve a program of animal
research on CNS effects.
-
"Since work with these compounds
is essential, it will be necessary to know in advance what
mental effects may occur after exposure... This is important
not only to protect a given individual, but also to prevent
a confused workman from injuring others by improperly
performing his duties.
The author of the 1944 CNS research
proposal attached to the 29 April memo was Dr Harold C. Hodge - at
the time, chief of fluoride toxicology studies for the
University of Rochester division of the Manhattan Project.
-
1944
When a severe pollution incident
occurred downwind of the E.I.
DuPont de Nemours Company
chemical factory in Deepwater, New Jersey. The factory was then
producing millions of pounds of fluoride for the Manhattan
Project whose scientists were racing to produce the world's
first atomic bomb. The farms downwind in Gloucester and Salem
counties were famous for their high-quality produce.
Their peaches went directly to the
Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City; their tomatoes were
bought up by Campbell's Soup. But in the summer of 1944 the
farmers began reporting that their crops were blighted:
"Something is burning up the peach crops around here." They said
that poultry died after an all-night thunderstorm, and that farm
workers who ate produce they'd picked would sometimes vomit all
night and into the next day.
-
"I remember our horses looked
sick and were too stiff to work," Mildred Giordano, a
teenager at the time, told these reporters.
Some cows were so crippled that they
could not stand up; they could only graze by crawling on their
bellies. The account was confirmed in taped interviews with
Philip Sadtler (shortly before he died), of Sadtler Laboratories
of Philadelphia, one of the nation's oldest chemical consulting
firms. Sadtler had personally conducted the initial
investigation of the damage.
The farmers were stonewalled in
their search for information about fluoride's effects on their
health, and their complaints have long since been forgotten. But
they unknowingly left their imprint on history: their complaints
of injury to their health reverberated through the corridors of
power in Washington and triggered intensive, secret,
bomb program research on the health
effects of fluoride.
-
1944
U.S. Navy uses human subjects to
test gas masks and clothing. Individuals were locked in a gas
chamber and exposed to mustard gas and lewisite.
-
1945 May
Newburgh's water was fluoridated,
and over the next 10 years its residents were studied by the New
York State Health Department.
-
1945-1955
Much of the original proof that
fluoride is safe for humans in low doses was generated by A-bomb
program scientists who had been secretly ordered to provide
"evidence useful in litigation" against defense contractors for
fluoride injury to citizens. The first lawsuits against the
American A-bomb program were not over radiation, but over
fluoride damage, the documents show. Human studies were
required. Bomb program researchers played a leading role in the
design and implementation of the most extensive US study of the
health effects of fluoridating public drinking water, conducted
in Newburgh, New York, from 1945 to 1955.
Then, in a classified operation
code-named "Program F", they secretly gathered and analyzed
blood and tissue samples from Newburgh citizens with the
cooperation of New York State Health Department personnel. The
original, secret version (obtained by these reporters) of a
study published by Program F scientists in the August 1948
Journal of the American Dental Association shows that evidence
of adverse health effects from fluoride was censored by the US
Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)-considered the most powerful of
Cold War agencies-for reasons of "national security".
The bomb program's fluoride safety
studies were conducted at the University of Rochester-site of
one of the most notorious human radiation experiments of the
Cold War, in which unsuspecting hospital patients were injected
with toxic doses of radioactive plutonium. The fluoride studies
were conducted with the same ethical mindset, in which "national
security" was paramount.
Hitler claimed to have gotten his inspiration for the "final
solution" from the extermination of Native Americans in the U.S.
-
1947
By then, as the 1950s dawned, mad
sheep disease was shown in the United States to jump the species
barrier when a scrapie-infected food supplement brought a
similar brain illness to farm-raised mink in 1947. By this
stage, the medico-scientific fraternity was intensely
preoccupied with another incurable brain illness, kuru, which
had reached epidemic proportions amongst the Fore people living
in the highlands of New Guinea.
Anthropologists from the University
of Adelaide unraveled a chain of events to trace the origin of
kuru back to the reverent consumption of deceased tribal
members' bodies. Kuru was essentially eradicated by New Guinean
authorities acting in 1959 on the anthropological clue to outlaw
the eating of human flesh.

The CIA begins its study of
LSD as a
potential weapon for use by American intelligence. Human
subjects (both civilian and military) are used with and without
their knowledge.

U.S. Army begins 20 years of
simulated germ warfare attacks against American cities,
conducting at least 239 open air tests.

-
1950 Sept. 20-26
One of the biggest experiments
involved the use of Serratia marcescens and bacillus globigi
being sprayed over 117 square miles of the San Francisco area,
causing pneumonia-like infections in many of the residents. The
family of one elderly man who died in the test sued the
government, but lost. To this day, syraceus is a leading cause
of death among the elderly in the San Francisco area.
-
1950
Department of Defense begins plans
to detonate nuclear weapons in desert areas and monitor downwind
residents for medical problems and mortality rates
-
1953
U.S. military releases clouds of
zinc cadmium sulfide gas over Winnipeg, St. Louis, Minneapolis,
Fort Wayne, the Monocacy River Valley in Maryland, and Leesburg,
Virginia. Their intent is to determine how efficiently they
could disperse chemical agents.
-
1953
CIA initiates
Project MKULTRA. This
is an eleven year research program designed to produce and test
drugs and biological agents that would be used for mind control
and behavior modification. Six of the subprojects involved
testing the agents on unwitting human beings.
-
1955
Another case was the joint Army-CIA
BW test in 1955, still classified, in which an undisclosed
bacteria was released in the Tampa Bay region of Florida,
causing a dramatic increase in whooping cough infections,
including twelve deaths.
-
1956
The Soviet Union accused the U.S. of
using biological weapons in Korea, which lead them to threaten
future use of Chemical and Biological weapons. This changed the
focus of the U.S. program to a more defensive one. Before this,
the bulk of the research was based at Ft. Detrick and used
"surrogate biological agents" to model more deadly organisms.
Most of the offensive tests were based on "secret spraying" of
organisms over populated areas. This program was (supposedly)
shut down in 1969.
-
1956
Cambodia established gun control.
From 1975 to 1977, one million "educated" people, unable to
defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
-
1956
U.S. military releases mosquitoes
infected with Yellow Fever over Savannah, Ga and Avon Park, Fl.
Following each test, Army agents posing as public health
officials test victims for effects.

1958
LSD is tested on 95 volunteers at
the Army's Chemical Warfare Laboratories for its effect on
intelligence.
-
1960
The Army Assistant Chief-of-Staff
for Intelligence (ACSI) authorizes field testing of LSD in
Europe and the Far East. Testing of the European population is
code named Project THIRD CHANCE; testing of the Asian population
is code named Project DERBY HAT.
-
1963
The mass vaccination campaigns of
the 1950s and '60s may be causing hundreds of deaths a year
because of a cancer-causing virus that contaminated the first
polio vaccine, according to scientists. Known as SV40, the virus
came from dead monkeys whose kidney cells were used to culture
the first Salk vaccines. Doctors estimate that the virus was
injected into tens of millions during the vaccination campaigns,
including several million in Canada, before being detected and
screened out in 1963. Those born between 1941 and 1961 are
thought to be most at risk of having been infected.
-
1964
Guatemala established gun control.
From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend
themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
-
1965
Aspartame is the technical name for
the brand names, NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, and Equal-Measure.
Aspartame was discovered by accident in 1965, when James Schlatter, a chemist of G.D. Searle Company was testing an
anti-ulcer drug. Aspartame was approved for dry goods in 1981
and for carbonated beverages in 1983.
-
1965
CIA and Department of
Defense begin Project MKSEARCH, a program to develop a
capability to manipulate human behavior through the use of
mind-altering drugs.
-
1965
Prisoners at the Holmesburg State
Prison in Philadelphia are subjected to dioxin, the highly toxic
chemical component of Agent Orange used in Viet Nam. The men are
later studied for development of cancer, which indicates that
Agent Orange had been a suspected carcinogen all along.
-
1966
CIA initiates Project MKOFTEN, a
program to test the toxicological effects of certain drugs on
humans and animals.
-
1966 July 7-10
The virus Bacillus subtilis was
released throughout the New York subway system, conducted by the
U.S. Army's Special Operations Division. Due to the vast number
of people exposed it would virtually impossible to identify, let
alone prove, and specific health problems resulting directly
from this test.
-
1967
CIA and Department of Defense
implement Project MKNAOMI, successor to MKULTRA and designed to
maintain, stockpile and test biological and chemical weapons.

1968
CIA experiments with the possibility
of poisoning drinking water by injecting chemicals into the
water supply of the FDA in Washington, D.C.
-
Often/ Chickwit -1967 or 1968
Project OFTEN/CHICKWIT was initiated
by the Army Chemical Corps and the CIA's Office of Research and
Development to create new drug compounds "that could be used
offensively."
Hallucinogens were tested on inmates in
Pennsylvania, but very little is known about the experiments.
U.S. Army dispenses Bacillus
subtilis variant niger throughout the New York City subway
system.
More than a million civilians are exposed when army
scientists drop light bulbs filled with the bacteria onto
ventilation grates. It would appear that the CIA's drug testing
continued throughout the 1970s since, "A CIA memo dated March 8,
1971, indicates that a backlog of more than twenty-six thousand
drugs had been acquired 'for future screening'"
-
1968 - 69
The Hong Kong flu, which was
influenza A type H3N2, killed over 30,000 people in the U.S.
alone. That was a fortuitous learning event for some because it
taught them that the flu could still conceivably be used to wipe
out a population.
But at the same time, it pointed out the need
to precondition the populace so that those who might normally be
resistant could be rendered susceptible. Hence the development
of the vaccine program and the aerial spraying procedures to
condition the population. The purpose of the chemicals in the chemtrail's is to help the viral envelope fuse with lung cells,
permitting easier penetration and infection.
-
1969
At a House Appropriations hearing,
the Defense Department's Biological Warfare (BW) division
requested funds to develop through gene-splicing a new disease
that would both resist and break down a victim's immune system.
The funds were approved. AIDS
appeared within the requested time frame, and has the exact
characteristics specified.
-
1970
Uganda established gun control. From
1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves,
were rounded up and exterminated.
-
1972
The World Health Organization (W.H.O.)
published a similar proposal:
-
"An attempt should be made to
ascertain whether viruses can in fact exert selective
effects on immune function, e.g., by ...affecting T cell
function as opposed to B cell function. The possibility
should also be looked into that the immune response to the
virus itself may be impaired if the infecting virus damages
more or less selectively the cells responding to the viral
antigens."
(Bulletin of the W.H.O., vol. 47, p
257- 274.)
This is a clinical description of the function of the AIDS virus.
-
1972
It was discovered that black
children as young as age five were having psychosurgery
performed on them at the University of Mississippi in Jackson in
order to control "hyperactive" and "aggressive" behavior. Their
brains were being implanted with electrodes that were heated up
to melt areas of the brain that regulate emotion and intellect.
When we first opposed these experiments, and eventually stopped
them, we did so despite resistance from organized psychiatry and
the research community.
-
Mid-1970's
The incidence of AIDS infections in
Africa coincides exactly with the locations of the W.H.O.
smallpox vaccination program in the mid-1970's (London Times,
May 11, 1987). Some 14,000 Haitians then on UN secondment to
Central Africa were also vaccinated in this campaign. Personnel
actually conducting the vaccinations may have been completely
unaware that the vaccine was anything other than what they were
told.
-
1975
Two neuroscientists, Laura and (the
late) Eli Manuelides, from Yale University in the US, went on to
illustrate by 1975 that injections of human blood, like
injections of brain taken from kuru and CJD victims, transmitted
the disease across the species barrier to laboratory animals.
Their prophetic, but unheeded, message implied that blood was
the vehicle that carried the agent of CJD around the body until
it chanced upon an hospitable residence like the brain. This
meant that the blood route was the key to the transmission of
CJD from a primary host to a secondary host.
-
1975
The virus section of Fort Detrick's
Center for Biological Warfare Research is renamed the Fredrick
Cancer Research Facilities and placed under the supervision of
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) .
It is here that a special
virus cancer program is initiated by the U.S. Navy, purportedly
to develop cancer-causing viruses. It is also here that retrovirologists isolate a virus to which no immunity exists. It
is later named HTLV (Human T-cell Leukemia Virus).
-
On October 5, 1976
-
...just as the so-called "SWINE
FLU" inoculation program was getting under way, news reports
suddenly told us that we were experiencing fallout from an
alleged Chinese atmospheric nuclear blast on September 26.
Oddly enough, the initial reports about this came from the
East Coast, especially Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware,
and Connecticut; but certain areas of the Pacific Northwest
were soon mentioned as being affected too.
We were told that radioactive
iodine-131 was showing up in milk at various locations; but
we were also assured, as we invariably are whenever any
radioactive hazard appears, that there was really no danger.
In the days that followed we continued to hear about the
supposed Chinese fallout, but other things probably seemed
even more worrisome. For example, elderly people began dying
of heart attacks shortly after taking swine flu shots,
causing widespread alarm at first. But the Government
quickly assured us that their deaths didn't really matter at
all, that they would have died anyway; and the swine flu
inoculation program went right back into high gear.

1976
The joint KGB-CIA chemical warfare
experimentation program began in Philadelphia at the American
Legion Convention. A convenient test group was assembled, and it
was exploited. Data was desired for the effects of a formulation
of the new family of poisons on older men in particular, and the
American Legion Convention was chosen as the perfect target.
Aerosol spray cans containing poisoned room freshener were used
to selectively saturate the atmosphere of the Legionnaires.
Afterwards the special spray cans were taken from the hotel,
leaving the city by airplane from a small airport on the
northwest side of Philadelphia. Two of the active ingredients in
the poison that produced the Legionnaires Disease were plutonium
and zirconium.
Dr. Peter Beter
-
August 1976
About a month after the Legionnaire
episode, and had quite a different purpose; and so a different
poison formula was used. Plutonium was again an ingredient, as
it is in the entire line of chemical warfare agents now being
tested; but this time the formula was designed for very rapid
effect with the victims receiving a massive dose.
On a day late
in August two Air Force C-141 Starlifter transport aircraft that
were preparing to leave McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey on
flights over the Atlantic were sabotaged by the placement in
their cockpits of concealed canisters of poison gas, rigged so
that the gas would be released in flights without being
detected.
The two planes left McGuire at
nearly the same time, and crashed within hours of one another
when approaching separate destinations in Greenland and England.
The very next day, with the wreckage of the aircraft hardly
cooled, a Pentagon spokesman said, quote:
Officials also said there was no apparent connection
between the crashes. Apparently leaving the same Air Base at
practically the same time and then crashing almost
simultaneously without warning is not supposed to suggest the
possibility of anything but coincidence. No doubt it is also coincidence that
McGuire Air Force Base, the origin of these two strange fatal
flights, is right next door to Fort Dix where the whole swine
flu cover-up scare originated!

1976
Nobel Prize went to American
scientist Carleton Gajdusek for his experiments demonstrating
that injections of kuru brain (1967) and CJD brain (1969)
reproduced similar illnesses in chimpanzees.
A striking feature of AIDS is that it's ethno-selective. The
rate of infection is twice as high among Blacks, Latinos and
Native Americans as among whites, with death coming two to three
times as swiftly. And over 80% of the children with AIDS and 90%
of infants born with it are among these minorities. "Ethnic
weapons" that would strike certain racial groups more heavily
than others have been a long-standing U.S. Army BW objective.
(Harris and Paxman, p 265)
The "discovery" of the
AIDS virus (HTLV3) was announced by
Dr.
Robert Gallo at the National Cancer Institute, which is on the
grounds of Fort Detrick, Maryland, a primary U.S. Army

1977
Senate hearings on Health and
Scientific Research confirm that 239 populated areas had been
contaminated with biological agents between 1949 and 1969. Some
of the areas included San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Key West,
Panama City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis.
-
1978
The Hepatitis B vaccine study
appears to have been the initial means of planting the infection
in New York City. The test protocol specified non-monogamous
males only, and homosexuals received a different vaccine from
heterosexuals. At least 25-50% of the first reported New York
AIDS cases in 1981 had received the Hepatitis B test vaccine in
1978. By 1984, 64% of the vaccine recipients had AIDS, and the
figures on the current infection rate for the participants of
that study are held by the U.S. Department of Justice, and
"unavailable."

1978-1987
Even as the understanding of
spongiform encephalopathy increased, various human pituitary
hormone programs in countries such as Australia, France, New
Zealand, the United Kingdom and United States were attracting
hefty government sponsorships.
Few of the programs' stalwarts
caught on to the implications of the Manuelides' experiments,
and unsuccessful attempts between the years of 1978 and 1987 to
filter the CJD agent out of the pituitary hormones being
injected into unsuspecting short-statured children and infertile
women were left to one of this era's rare visionaries, British
scrapie expert Alan Dickinson.
At about the same time, a British
Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in 1979 raised the
possibility that the unregulated cycling of protein-rich sheep
remains back into animal feed might spread scrapie to cattle, as
it had done to farm mink in the US three decades beforehand, via
the oral route.

There was an explosion at a Soviet
plant in Sverdlosk and an outbreak of anthrax followed. At the
time, all accusations of BW research were vigorously denied by
Soviet officials, with the explanation that anthrax outbreaks
can occur naturally and that the explosion was merely a
coincidence.

A well-dressed, articulate stranger
visited the office of the Elberton Granite Finishing Company and
announced that he wanted to build an edifice to transmit a
message to mankind.
He identified himself as R. C. Christian,
but it soon became apparent that was not his real name. He said
that he represented a group of men who wanted to offer direction
to humanity, but to date, almost two decades later, no one knows
who R. C. Christian really was, or the names of those he
represented. Several things are apparent.
The messages engraved on
the Georgia Guidestones deal with four major fields:
-
(1) Governance and the
establishment of a world government,
-
(2) Population and
reproduction control,
-
(3) The environment and
man's relationship to nature, and
-
(4) Spirituality.
In the public library in Elberton, I
found a book written by the man who called himself R.C.
Christian.
I discovered that the monument he commissioned had
been erected in recognition of Thomas Paine and the occult
philosophy he espoused. Indeed, the Georgia Guidestones are used
for occult ceremonies and mystic celebrations to this very day.
Tragically, only one religious leader in the area had the
courage to speak out against the American Stonehenge, and he has
recently relocated his ministry.

Aspartame was invented by the G D
Searle Co. acquired by Monsanto in 1985. For 16 years FDA
refused to approve it until 1981 when Commissioner Arthur Hayes
overruled the objections of a Public Board of Inquiry and the
protests of the American Soft Drink Association and blessed it.
The tests submitted by Searle were so bad the Department of
Justice, initiated prosecution of Searle for fraud. Then the
defense lawyers hired the prosecutors, Sam Skinner and Wm.
Conlon, and the case expired when the statute of limitations ran
out. Aspartame/Nutrasweet, a toxin that blinds, drops
intelligence, eradicates memory, grows brain tumors and other
cancers, brings fatigue.
Depression, ADD, panic, rage,
paranoia, diabetes, seizures, suicide and death. This toxin is
supported by unlimited advertising and the manufacturers pay off
the American Diatetics Association, the American Diabetics
Association, the AMA, and whomever else, to convince us its safe
as rain. These lies are backed by a Federal Bureaucracy knowing
it may kill your child, but the bureaucrat who approved the
poison got a fat job as have many of his successors. Suppose
this government watchdog, ignoring thousands of consumer
complaints, has become an Attack Dog protecting corporate
corruption.
This is the bitter reality of
Aspartame/Nutrasweet, Monsanto, the FDA, Coca Cola, Pepsi, and
the hundreds of food, drink and drug makers who add to their

The first detailed charges regarding
AIDS as a BW weapon were published in the Patriot newspaper in
New Delhi, India. It is hard to say where the investigations of
this story in the Indian press might have led, if they had not
been sidetracked by two major domestic disasters shortly
thereafter: the assassination of Indira Gandhi on Oct. 31 and
the Bhopal Union Carbide plant "accident" that killed several
thousand and injured over 200,000 on Dec. 3.

According to the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences (83:4007-4011), HIV and
VISNA are
highly similar and share all structural elements, except for a
small segment which is nearly identical to HTLV. This leads to
speculation that HTLV and VISNA may have been linked to produce
a new retrovirus to which no natural immunity exists.

Dr Louis Elsas, Professor of
Pediatrics & Genetics at Emory University, testified before
Congress;
-
"Aspartame is in fact a well known neurotoxin and teratogen [triggers birth defects] which in some undefined dose
will irreversibly in the developing child or fetal brain,
produce adverse effects I am particularly angry at this type of
advertising that is promoting the sale of a neurotoxin in the
childhood age group." [Nov 2, 1987]
Neurosurgeon Russell Blaylock, MD, declares Aspartame is a toxin
like arsenic and cyanide that causes confusion, disorientation,
seizures, cancer, pancreatic, uterine, ovarian and brain tumors
and leads to Alzheimer's. Read Excitotoxins, the Taste That
Kills [505-474-0303]. Hear Dr. Blaylock's radio interview on

Courageous whistleblowers like these

During which time the number of
French children at risk of growth-hormone-related CJD had
practically doubled, the first French children fulfilled that

of the world's 100-plus cases of pituitary hormone-related CJD.

Although the general elitism of
human-pituitary programs restricted this brand of medical
madness to North America, Europe and Australasian, Third World
children and women did not altogether escape the insanity of
applying Frankenstein medicine to social conditions. A medical
report in 1991 linked the CJD death of a young Brazilian man,
like those of five youthful New Zealand men and women, with a
childhood treatment involving pituitary growth hormone obtained
from the US.
Unfortunately, the fate of women in
Mexico City whose breasts were injected with US pituitary
hormones in an appalling experiment to increase the volume of
milk in lactating mothers (some already pregnant again) will
probably never be known.

It was discovered the federal
violence initiative - the federal government's agency - wide plan
to go into America's inner cities to experiment on children in
the hope of finding genetic and biological causes for violence.
We opposed this program as racist and abusive of children. Our
efforts led to the cancellation of this program. It also led the
chief sponsor of the program, psychiatrist Frederick Goodwin, to
resign from his post as director of NIMH and to leave a career
in the government. The fenfluramine studies at Columbia and
Queens College are part of the violence initiative. They were
created under its umbrella before it was cancelled. They co

initiative were withdrawn, the actual individual projects

One has only to learn what really
happened to the Christians in Rwanda between April and July of
1994 to imagine what may lie in store for Christians here in
America at some time in the not-too-distant future.
After the
Christian Tutsis had been disarmed by governmental decree in the
early 1990s, Hutu-led military forces began to systematically
massacre the defenseless Christians. The massacre began in April
1994 and continued until July 1994. Using machetes rather than
bullets, the Hutu forces were able to create a state of abject
fear and terror within the helpless Christian population as they
systematically butchered hundreds of thousands of them.
The United Nations immediately
convened hearings on the genocide taking place in Rwanda, but
Madeline Albright, the American Ambassador to the United
Nations, argued strenuously that neighboring African nations
should not be allowed to intervene until the "civil war had come
to an end."
In reality, of course, there was no civil war since
those being slaughtered had no weapons with which to defend
themselves; it was simply a matter of mass murder. In addition
to blocking intervention by neighboring nations, Madeline
Albright also insisted that the word "genocide" must not be
used, and that the United Nations forces stationed in Rwanda
were not to be allowed to intervene. In the three months that
followed, between one-half and three-quarters of a million
Christians were systematically dismembered, hacked to death, and
slaughtered in the bloody carnage that ensued.
Tens of thousands of Christians were
murdered in their churches; tens of thousands more were murdered
in their hospitals and in their schools. On several occasions,
United Nations soldiers stationed in Rwanda actually handed over
helpless Christians under their protection to members of the
Hutu militia. They then stood by as their screaming charges were
unceremoniously hacked to pieces. At the end of the carnage, in
late July 1994, the American government rewarded the Hutu
murderers with millions of dollars in foreign aid.
Strangely, the American press has
remained silent
Subversion Of The Free Press By The CIA
about the fact that almost all of those who were slaughtered
were Christians, and it was the policies of our government that
were primarily responsible for blocking efforts by neighboring
African countries to intervene.

With a technique called "gene

in Houston, TX discovers that many returning Desert Storm
veterans are infected with an altered strain of Mycoplasma
incognitus, a microbe commonly used in the production of
biological weapons. Incorporated into its molecular structure is
40 percent of the HIV protein coat, indicating that it had been

Dr Phyllis Mullenix, former head of
toxicology at Forsyth Dental Center in Boston and now a critic
of fluoridation. Animal studies which Mullenix and co-workers
conducted at Forsyth in the early 1990s indicated that fluoride
was a powerful central nervous system (CNS) toxin and might
adversely affect human brain functioning even at low doses. (New
epidemiological evidence from China adds support, showing a
correlation between low-dose fluoride exposure and diminished IQ
in children.) Mullenix's results were published in 1995 in a
reputable peer-reviewed scientific journal.

The University of Rochester's
classified fluoride studies, code-named "Program F", were
started during the war and continued up until the early 1950s.
They were conducted at its Atomic Energy Project (AEP), a
top-secret facility funded by the AEC and housed at Strong
Memorial Hospital.
It was there that one of the most notorious
human radiation experiments of the Cold War took place, in which
unsuspecting hospital patients were injected with toxic doses of
radioactive plutonium. Revelation of this experiment - in a
Pulitzer Prize winning account by Eileen Welsome - led to a
1995 US presidential investigation and a multimillion-dollar
cash settlement for victims.

A new scientific paper dealing with
a meta-analysis of 23 different scientific studies on the
relationship between first-trimester abortions and breast cancer
was published in a British medical journal.
That study clearly
demonstrated a higher incidence of breast cancer in women who
had had first-trimester abortions. In response to that
publication, the American Medical Association (AMA), the
American Cancer Society (ACS), and
pro-abortion/population-control advocates joined together in an
unholy alliance to attack the conclusions of the authors, and to
block all efforts to disseminate that information to American
physicians.

1997 October
Speaking from Washington, DC, Nobel
Prize winner for discovering the role of molecules known as "prions"
in the invariably fatal brain illnesses such as "mad
cow disease" or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans,
Dr
Stanley Prusiner from the University of California predicted
that the first drug therapy, which would not necessarily be a
cure for BSE or CJD, was at least five years away.
At the same time, on the opposite
side of the Atlantic, the post-mortem of Chris Warne, a
36-year-old fitness fanatic from Derbyshire, England, revealed
that he was the 21st victim of the new variant of CJD which had
spread from BSE-infected cattle to humans via the food chain.
Only 18 months earlier, a British House of Commons admission
that BSE-infected meat had probably caused the CJD deaths of 10
youthful Britons left the British meat industry in tatters.
