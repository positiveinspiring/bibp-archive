# Putin vs. Obama - Real World vs. Deluded Fantasy

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_russia47.htm

Listening to the speeches of the
Russian President,
Vladimir Putin, and the President of
the United States,
Barack Obama, at
the United Nations
General Assembly in New York on Monday, one is instantly struck
by the polarization of the leader's interpretation of world
events. It is obvious that one leader resides in real world,
whilst the other appears to live in a deluded fantasy.
You can understand why US Secretary of State,
John Kerry, starts
yawning (far below video) 2 minutes and 47 seconds into Obama's speech, as the
US President's delivery was completely devoid of vigor, spirit
or honesty.
An empty suit hypnotically going through the motions
and reciting the usual propagated slogans, the US President
spends as much time pausing as he does reading off his trusted
teleprompter.
Unsurprisingly,
Obama promulgated the usual slogans (far
below video) in relation to
Ukraine
and
Syria.
The US President referred to the Syrian president
Bashar al-Assad as a tyrant "who drops barrel bombs to
'massacre
innocent children'," then moved on to deceptively describe how
the Syrian conflict started in addition to reiterating once
again that Assad must go:
"Let's remember how this
started. Assad reacted to peaceful protests, by escalating
repression and killing, and in turn created the environment
for the current strife
Realism also requires a managed
transition away from Assad and to a new leader."
A declassified intelligence
report from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in 2012, a
year after the violence erupted, completely contradicts the
notion that the protests were "peaceful", as the report
documents that,
"the
Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood and AQI [Al-Qaeda in
Iraq], are the major forces driving the insurgency in
Syria."
In addition, an evil dictator
slaughtering peaceful protestors is the exact same propaganda
the West used in order to demonize Muammar al-Qaddafi
in Libya, even though the Libyan leader just like the Syrian
leader was reacting to violent protests.
Associate Professor
of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Alan J.
Kuperman, wrote a policy brief in 2013, titled,
Lessons from Libya - How not to Intervene,
in which he dispels the false narrative that Qaddafi
instigated the violence:
"Contrary to Western media reports, Qaddafi did not initiate
Libya's violence by targeting peaceful protesters.
The
United Nations and Amnesty International have documented
that in all four Libyan cities initially consumed by civil
conflict in mid-February 2011 - Benghazi, Al Bayda, Tripoli,
and Misurata - violence was actually initiated by the
protesters.
The government responded to the rebels
militarily but never intentionally targeted civilians or
resorted to 'indiscriminate' force, as Western media
claimed."
Obama on Ukraine
Obama's comments on
the crisis in
Ukraine were factually inaccurate and frankly
absurd, although
it is the type of rhetoric incessantly spouted by Western
officials.
The US President said:
"Consider Russia's annexation of Crimea and further
aggression in Eastern Ukraine.
America has few economic interests in Ukraine, we recognize
the deep and complex history between Russia and Ukraine, but
we cannot stand by when the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of a nation is flagrantly violated.
If that happens without consequence in Ukraine, it could
happen to any nation here today."
So the US apparently,
"cannot stand
by when the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation is
flagrantly violated", at the same time the US is leading a
coalition in Syria which
violates international law and violates Syria's "sovereignty
and territorial integrity".
Secondly, there was a referendum in
Crimea and the
majority voted to rejoin Russia, Moscow did not coercively
and aggressively force the Crimean people into the decision.
Western
Aggression
Thirdly, it was the West that overthrew the
Ukrainian government, not Russia, a reality that even Foreign
Affairs admits in an article written by the
Professor of Political Science
at the University of Chicago, John J. Mearsheimer,
titled,
Why the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault:
"The United States and its
European allies share most of the responsibility for the
crisis. The tap-root of the trouble is NATO enlargement, the
central element of a larger strategy to move Ukraine out of
Russia's orbit and integrate it into the West.
At the same time, the EU's
expansion eastward and the West's backing of the
pro-democracy movement in Ukraine - beginning with the
Orange Revolution in 2004 - were critical elements, too."
Mearsheimer
continues:
"Although the full extent of
U.S. involvement has not yet come to light, it is clear that
Washington backed the coup
The United States and its allies
should abandon their plan to Westernize Ukraine and instead
aim to make it a neutral buffer
It is time to put an end to
Western support for another Orange Revolution
The result
is that the United States and its allies unknowingly
provoked a major crisis over Ukraine."
Fourthly, how can Obama say "America
has few economic interests in Ukraine", when Hunter Biden, the
son of the US Vice President, Joe Biden,
joined the Board of Directors of one of the largest gas
company's in Ukraine (Burisma
Holdings) following the coup?
A rare truth in Obama's speech was
when he called on Muslims to continue to reject,
"those who distort Islam to
preach intolerance and promote violence", adding that people
that are not Muslim should reject "the ignorance that equates
Islam with terror."
I completely agree with this
statement.
What Obama omits however, is that
the majority of the radical Islamic terror groups that distort
Islam are created and supported by Western intelligence agencies
and regional allies in the first place.
Another microcosm of truth in
Obama's speech was not anything Obama actually said, but the
response by the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, to the
US President's fallacious words.
Even though the US has played a
pivotal role in directly causing the Syrian crisis -
by funding
ISIS and al-Qaeda to overthrow the Syrian government - in
addition to being hostile to any serious dialogue with Russia
and Iran, it still didn't stop Obama falsely claiming,
"the United States is prepared
to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to
resolve the [Syrian] conflict."
Lavrov's response to the comment was
a frustrated shake of the head, and a look of disbelief that
someone can lie so blatantly to the world (I suggest you watch
that part, it's quite amusing - from
26:15 into the speech):
Barack Obama's entire U.N. speech
(September 2015)
Hopefully however, the US will
eventually come to their senses and engage seriously with key
players around the world to end conflicts they played a major
role in creating - I wouldn't hold your breath though.
Putin - The Voice
of Reason
Putin's speech was the
antithesis of Obama's - insightful, honest, constructive and
statesman-like.
The Russian President's analysis of
the major geopolitical issues of our time was outstanding, with
many practical, viable solutions to these issues provided.
I highly recommend readers listen
to the full speech as it is filled with critical and pertinent
information, and I can't include it all in this article.
(Note
that quotes from Putin below, are based on the Russian to
English translation of his speech featured in this
RT article)
Putin stressed that some nations,
"after the end of the cold war" considered themselves "so strong
and exceptional" that they thought "they knew better than
others".
The Russian President asserted that
it is "extremely dangerous" for states to attempt to "undermine
the legitimacy of the United Nations":
"Russia stands ready to work
together with its partners on the basis of broad consensus,
but we consider the attempts to undermine the legitimacy of
the United Nations as extremely dangerous.
They could lead
to the collapse of the architecture of international
relations, and then there would be no other rules left but
the rule of force. We would get a world dominated by
selfishness, rather than collective work. A world
increasingly characterized by dictates, rather than
equality.
There would be less genuine democracy and freedom,
and there would be a world where true independent states
would be replaced by an ever growing number of de facto
protectorates and externally controlled territories."
Speaking about the turmoil in the
Middle East, the Russian leader correctly denounces "aggressive
foreign interference" as a destructive force which has only
brought chaos, not democracy:
"But how did it actually turn out?
Rather than bringing
about reforms, aggressive foreign interference has resulted
in the destruction of national institutions and the
lifestyle itself.
Instead of the triumph of democracy and
progress, we got violence, poverty and social disaster, and
nobody cares a bit about human rights - including, the right
to life.
I cannot help asking those who have caused this
situation:
do you realize now what you have done?
But I am
afraid that no one is going to answer that.
Indeed, policies
based on self-conceit and belief in ones exceptionality and
impunity, have never been abandoned."
NATO's
"Gross Violation" of UNSC Resolution 1973
Putin specifically pinpoints Libya
as a major recruiting ground for the so-called Islamic State
(ISIS) - after
NATO destroyed the North African nation in 2011,
adding that Western supported rebels in Syria often defect to
ISIS:
"Many recruits also come from Libya, a country whose
statehood was destroyed as a result of a gross violation of
the
UN Security Council Resolution 1973.
And now the ranks
of radicals are being joined by the members of the so-called
moderate Syrian opposition, [which is] supported by the
Western countries.
First they are armed and trained, and
then they defect to the so-called Islamic State."
Reports of US trained
"moderate" fighters defecting to ISIS are ubiquitous.
One
example was when approximately
3,000 rebels from the Free Syrian Army defected to ISIS
earlier this year.
Interestingly, Putin also points out that
ISIS did not just magically appear out of thin air, but the
group was, "forged as a tool against undesirable regimes":
"Besides, the Islamic State itself did not just come from
nowhere; it was also initially forged as a tool
against undesirable secular regimes."
This thesis is further
confirmed by the 2012
declassified report
from the DIA, which reveals that the powers supporting the
Syrian opposition - "Western countries, the Gulf states and
Turkey" - wanted to create a "Salafist principality in Eastern
Syria in order to isolate the Syrian regime":
"Opposition forces are
trying to control the Eastern areas (Hasaka and Der Zor),
adjacent to the Western Iraqi provinces (Mosul and Anbar),
in addition to neighboring Turkish borders.
Western
countries, the Gulf states and Turkey are supporting these
efforts
If the situation unravels there is the possibility
of establishing a declared or undeclared Salafist
principality in Eastern Syria (Hasaka and Der Zor), and this
is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition
want, in order to isolate the Syrian regime, which is
considered the strategic depth of the Shia expansion (Iraq
and Iran)."
(p.5)
The former head of the DIA, Michael
T. Flynn, also recently admitted that the Obama administration
took the "willful
decision" to support the rise of ISIS.
Don't Play with Fire
Putin then goes on to issue a stark
warning to the nefarious forces who have been using radical
groups as geopolitical tools:
"It is hypocritical and irresponsible to make loud
declarations about the threat of international terrorism,
while turning a blind-eye to the channels of financing
It
would be equally irresponsible to try to manipulate
extremist groups and place them at one's service in order to
achieve one's own political goals, in the hope of later
dealing with them.
To those who do so, I would like to say:
Dear sirs, no doubt you are dealing with rough and cruel
people, but they are [not] primitive or silly, they are just
as clever as you are, and you never know who is manipulating
whom
We believe that any attempts to play games with
terrorists, let alone to arm them, are not just
short-sighted but fire hazardous."
ISIS,
"desecrates one of the greatest
world religions by its bloody crimes", Russia's leader said,
adding: "The ideology of militants makes a mockery of Islam
and perverts its true humanistic values."
Defeating
ISIS
As ISIS continues to expand its
influence, it is increasingly becoming a national security
threat for numerous countries outside of the Middle East, and
"Russia is not an exception".
Putin stated that,
"we cannot allow these criminals
who have already tasted blood to return back home and
continue their evil doings
Russia has always been
consistently fighting against terrorism in all its forms.
Today, we provide military and technical assistance both to
Iraq and Syria and many other countries of the region who
are fighting terrorist groups.
We think it is an enormous
mistake to refuse to cooperate with the Syrian government
and its armed forces, who are valiantly fighting terrorism
face to face.
We should finally acknowledge
that no one but President Assad's armed forces and Kurdish
militia are truly fighting Islamic State and other terrorist
organizations in Syria"
The Russia President stated the
solution to the scourge of ISIS is to,
"create a genuinely broad
international coalition against terrorism" in accordance
with "international law", which "similar to the anti-Hitler
coalition, could unite a broad range of forces".
"The desire to explore new
geopolitical areas is still present among some of our
colleagues," Putin said.
"First they continued
their policy of expanding NATO,"
he
said, following the collapse of the Soviet Union,
"they offered post-Soviet countries a false choice - either
to be with the West or with the East.
Sooner or later this
logic of confrontation was bound to spark off a grave
geopolitical crisis.
This is exactly what happened in
Ukraine where the discontent of the population with the
current authorities was used and a military coup was
orchestrated from outside that triggered civil war as a
result."
Russia's leader maintained that the
solution to the Ukrainian crisis is,
"through the full and
faithful implementation of the Minsk accords".
"We are confident that only
through full and faithful implementation of the Minsk
agreements of February 12th2015, can we put an end to the
bloodshed and find a way out of the deadlock.
Ukraine's territorial integrity
cannot be ensured by threats and the force of arms. What is
needed is a genuine consideration of the interests and
rights of people in the Donbass region, and respect for
their choice."
What is blatantly clear from listening to both
leaders' speeches is that the moral leader of the world resides
in Russia.
