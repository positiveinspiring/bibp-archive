High level sources have provided us with a
flurry of contradictory news about Chinese President Hu Jintao and
what promises he extracted during his January visit to Washington.
A high level CIA source has said the Washington
establishment was forced to promise Hu that,
Other sources including a senior Japanese
leftist activist (a new but famous source) and a member of the
British Royal family are saying Hu was
blackmailed in Washington and would thus soon be removed from the Chinese
power structure.
Finally, senior Chinese sources introduced by
the yakuza are telling us the so-called Dragon Family has nothing to do with
China.
What is clear from all this information, much of
it from new and unverified sources, as well as all the revolutionary
incidents being provoked around the world, is that we have entered a very
sensitive time in the battle over the future of the planet earth.
The
White Dragon Society has also now been
contacted by an outfit known as 'Alpha Omega Station.'
Alpha Omega was the link between the US
dollar and the Ruble during the cold war. During the cold war, the only way
to carry out foreign exchange transactions between the US dollar and the
Russian Ruble was to go through Alpha Omega Station, according to a
senior
Russian FSB and CIA sources.
Alpha Omega was given an unexpected new role in 1994 when the French,
American and British
Bretton Woods
mandate expired and Western financial oligarchs could not agree on a new
regime.
The control over the dollar was thus temporarily
given, the sources said, to Yuri Andropov, the head of the KGB. Our
FSB source says that a high level conference was called in 1994 and various
extremely senior people (mostly Royal family members) were ordered to bring
7 devices that controlled aspects of the financial system.
The boxes were stolen at the meeting by US officials (including Bill
Clinton) and their Russian collaborators (including Michkael Gorbachev) in
an attempt to hijack control of the financial system.
Unfortunately, they were unable to overcome security measures put in place
and a secret war over control of the worlds money has raged on ever since,
the sources say. The FSB is now offering to help reactivate the system, they
claim.
However, Ambassador
Leo Wanta, who claims to have been part
of the operation to overthrow the US financial system has never heard of
Alpha Omega station.
The FSB source, for his part, says the money Wanta got was part of a larger
pool but that Wanta did not have the codes necessary to use it.
We are not sure exactly what to make of this
information other than to say that it fits in well with bits and pieces of
related intelligence gathered in the past (such as unsolved incidents
involving murdered Russians and empty safes rumored at the time to be
related to the fall of the Soviet Union).
The Russian source also promised to provide codes to the Bank of Japan to
prove his authenticity. This has yet to happen, however, but it may soon.
Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor and Senior BIS member Masaaki Shirakawa
had the following to say about the negotiations towards a new Financial
System:
We are in a constant process of finding a
new model, and that we are seriously discussing how monetary policy is
conducted
it is something we are working on.
Shirakawa also said the gold backed system used
up until the 1930s failed because,
it was not flexible enough.
Shirakawa was speaking at the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Japan.
The Chinese sources introduced by the Yakuza, for their part, said they
expected vast funds to be released world-wide sometime by March. They
claimed to represent a senior Southern Chinese power broker and added they
dealt directly with Federal Reserve Board Governor Ben Bernanke.
The release of the funds would come as soon as
the paper work for a new foundation to act as a temporary depository was
completed, they said.
These sources also said that it was Chinese custom for all Politburo members
to take a piece of any business they gave the green light to and that they
were immune to blackmail about this because it was part of the system they
use.
The leftist Japanese source connected to senior state Shinto hierarchy for
his part, said Hu Jintao had created a fake past for himself and that in
reality he was a Japanese agent and he was being blackmailed about this.
This dovetails with an earlier claim by a source linked to Rupert Murdoch
that Hu was linked to the Japanese
Sokka Gakkai Buddhist sect.
The sudden approach of new sources bad-mouthing Hu, however, raises my
suspicions because as a general rule when new sources pop up and actively
feed a journalist with explosive information, they usually have a
hidden agenda.
In any case, this is an internal Chinese matter
they will deal with.
Things are definitely coming to a head soon.
