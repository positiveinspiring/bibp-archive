Editors' Notes
I: HISTORY
1. "Compared with the preceding Neanderthals, who displayed virtually no technological innovation during more than 100,000 years of existence, the Aurignacian [Cro-Magnon] peoples were able to realise with increasing rapidity, a wide range of social, technological and mythical possibilities. Having surveyed some of the key developments of the Aurignacian in technology, body ornamentation and representation, one is led to ask whether there is any way to tie them together... Close to the heart of these developments is an increased ability to think in - and communicate by means of - specific visual images". This quote is from 'Visual Thinking in the Ice Age' by Randall White, Scientific American, Vol 261, No 1, July 1989.
In the last few years, information that the Nine supplied twenty years ago has been corroborated by new evidence. As one authority described the findings: "After an evolutionary struggle lasting millions of years, our species emerged as top hominid. And then, in one spectacular moment we became human. As recently as 35,000 years ago, western Europe was still occupied by Neanderthals - primitive beings for whom art and progress scarcely existed. Then there was an abrupt change; anatomically modern people appeared in Europe and suddenly, so did sculpture, musical instruments, lamps, trade and innovation. Within a few thousand years Neanderthals were gone. Insofar as there was any single moment when we could be said to have become human, it was at the time of this great leap forward. 35,000 years ago". From 'The Great Leap Forward - Dawn of the Human Race' by Jared Diamond in Discover the World of Science, May 1989. Refer also to: 'The Search for Modem Humans' by John J Putman, National Geographic Magazine, October 1988.
2. The beginnings of Egyptian civilization have been a perpetual source of mystery for historians and archeologists, for the elements which made up later Egyptian civilization suddenly seemed to appear at once, in the fourth millennium BC. Egypt moved straight from a stage of pre-civilization to the government of large areas, without the usual era of city-states intervening. The ordinary logic of historical development does not apply to Egypt as it does to Mesopotamia.
3. The Sumerian civilization, in our historical records, began around 6,000 to 5,000 BC in what is now southern Iraq,
4. Around AD 1,200 There was a dose relationship between the Mongol Emperors of China, Mongka Khan and Qubilai Khan, and the Tibetan Lamas Sakya Pandita and Karma Pakshi. However, Srongtsen Gampo, a powerful Tibetan King in the early 600s and the first Buddhist monarch of Tibet, had a Chinese wife and a Nepalese wife, both of whom were responsible for converting him to the Buddha-Dharma.
5. loannes, also known as Jonah, was half-man, half-fish in mythology, the God of the water-depths, and a friend to people. He brought culture, literacy and sciences to the ancients of Ur, and was looked on as a potter who shaped the lives of men and gods. His wife was Hinlil, goddess of grain, and wheat is reputed to have been given to humanity by these two.
6. The Kahuna are the indigenous medicine-men of the Hawaii Islands, possessing an advanced philosophy of life.
7. Megiddo is recognized by archaeologists to date back at least to Chalcolithic settlements around the 4000S BC (the time of Upper and Lower Egypt and the Sumerian city-states), and twenty occupation levels have been identified. It was attacked, re-peopled and re-built not only by the local peoples but also involving Phoenicians (1490s Bc) Egyptians (1460S BC). When Joshua and the Israelites entered the area from Sinai (about 1250 BC), Megiddo, with Jericho, was one of the Canaanite strongholds and archaeological remains demonstrate a formidable level of civilization there. It was completely re-built as a fortified city by Solomon (950s-940SBC), then destroyed and reconstructed by the Assyrians in 733 BC, and the Mesopotamians were involved around 730 BC. It went into terminal decline at the time of the defeat and death of Josiah in 609 BC.
8. Kingston-on-Thames has a landscape zodiac, miles wide, similar to the Glastonbury zodiac as was identified by Katherine Maltwood and Mary Caine in their work on landscape zodiacs and temples.
9. The Harmonic Convergence was held in August 1987. Thousands of people gathered together at different sacred sites to create a worldwide meditational link.
II: SCIENCE & ECOLOGY
10. Absolute zero, however, is super-cold only from our Earth experience, and in relation to our dense physical existence, which survives within a narrow band of temperature parameters.
11. Matter and anti-matter are fundamentally dissociated kinds of energy and form which seek to neutralize each other.
12. Our neighbour star Sirius is seven light years away. The Pleiades are 410 light years away. All stars visible to the naked eye are from 4 to 1,000 light years away. The centre of our galaxy is 15,000 light years away. A fight year is 63,240 times the distance between Sun and Earth. Local galaxies are over a million light years away from us.
13. In physics, when a moving or changing body of mass attains a certain impetus or intensity, it goes critical, while it gathers energy for a fundamental change into another form. An example of this is water approaching boiling-point, in which there is a pause in the heating process, as the water makes the conversion from liquid to steamvapour.
14. Heavy water is a technology involved in the nuclear industry. If it is released into the environment, there is a risk that it would convert ordinary water into heavy water, thus rendering all water use impossible.
15. According to the 'Hundredth Monkey principle' once something new has been learned by a significant percentage of a species, others of the same species will adopt the new principle, even if they are not geographically connected to the original group. Rupert Sheldrake has written extensively about this and calls it Morphogenic Resonance.
16. In the last 150 years (the age of steam engines and cars), carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have increased by 30%, and continue to increase by 3% per year, or 0.4% of atmospheric composition. About half of the C02 we produce by fossil fuel burning is absorbed by carbon dioxide consumers like forests, wetlands and ocean plankton, which themselves continue to decline - the other half builds up in the atmosphere. If nothing changes, carbon dioxide levels are set to double between 1990 and 2030. Nitrogen and phosphorus output into the oceans also kills marine plant communities, taking oxygen out of the water and starving other marine fife forms. The carbon dioxide factor is a major contributor to the Greenhouse Effect which is leading to rising temperatures and climatic change worldwide.
17. Dolphins: The Nine give special attention to dolphins, their work on Planet Earth is seen to be as significant as ours.
18. Chilean fishermen, who kill 5,000 dolphins per year for use as crab-bait, call them 'tontitas' or 'silly ones' because they are friendly and easy to kill, and because their fellows mass around a captured dolphin to rescue it, thus becoming easy prey themselves. In a 13-year period, 4.8 million dolphins were killed by US-registered boats alone, and they are still permitted to kill up to 20,500 per year. The tuna industry kills 110,000 dolphins annually in the East Pacific. Commercial killing of dolphins is done mainly by Japan, Taiwan, Sri Lanka and Peru. (Data source: WWF Environment Handbook, Macdonald Optima, UK, 1990).
19. To feed our demand for meat and dairy products, we now have 15 billion cattle in the world, each of which contributes two liters of flatulence daily. Flatulence contains methane (also produced when land and water are disturbed), which absorbs oxygen. Additionally five billion people each produce 0. 25 liters of flatulence daily.
20. Holes in the ionosphere relate to ozone-layer depletion, caused by CFCs and halon gases, which eat high-level ozone, and remove the ultra-violet filtering shield in Earth's atmosphere.
III: SPIRITUAL
21. The chakras are subtle energy centers within the body, traditionally seven in number: the root chakra between the legs; the sacral centre three finger-widths below the navel; the solar plexus, a handwidth above the navel; the heart chakra, in the centre of the breast bone; the throat chakra at the base of the throat; the brow chakra just above and between the eyebrows; and the crown chakra at the top of the head.
22. Karma is a Sanskrit (North Indian classical language) word, meaning action and its laws, often interpreted in the West as the law of cause-and-effect.

Back Cover
THE ONLY PLANET OF CHOICE
Essential Briefings from Deep Space
"If this book is a work of the imagination, it is a poetic and consistent work of art, if, as I prefer to believe, it is based on truth, it must be one of the most important books ever written."
-Michael Glickman, journalist and cereologist.
Since its spectacular launch in 1993, The Only Planet of Choice has been widely acknowledged as one of the most significant books for our time. Many of those thousands who have already read it have spoken of the profound effect it has had upon them.
This book represents the outcome of twenty years of work by a distinguished international research group whose members have been communicating through psychic transceiver, Phyllis Schlemmer, with an enlightened circle of universal beings known as the Council of Nine.
Their dialogues have continued and the result is this updated edition of The Only Planet of Choice. Published this time without any linking commentaries but with a vital new chapter on the 1990s, the book contains a mass of fresh and pressing information of particular relevance to our troubled world as it approaches the end of the millennium.
Its underlying theme is free will and the power of the inhabitants of Planet Earth to create a better, more harmonious world. Among the many themes covered in detail are the existence of ET civilizations and their interactions with Earth, the nature of the Source of the Universe, the ancient history of humanity, Jesus the Nazarene, environmental issues and humankind's as-yet-unrealized potential for self-awareness. But, above all, for those who are prepared to listen and heed its message, it offers a positive outcome for the future.
New readers will welcome the opportunity to explore this riveting book for the first time. Existing readers will want to discover the wise new truths it contains.
"Everything you ever wanted to know about the Universe but didn't
know who to ask."-- Kindred Spirit magazine.
