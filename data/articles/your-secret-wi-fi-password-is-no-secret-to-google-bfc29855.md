Chances are,
Google knows that password.
If you've ever logged on to your network with an
Android device, or even if it was just a friend logging on just once,
chances are Google has your password stored in their servers. In fact, it's
very possible that Google knows just about every Wi-Fi password in the
world.
It's not a secret, exactly, as
Michael Horowitz at
Computer World points out in a recent
blog post.
The issue has been covered by several prominent blogs,
but during the current privacy backlash against tech companies, the
collection of millions of Wi-Fi passwords has mostly flown under the radar.
But it's a notable issue. As Horowitz points
out,
an estimate 748 million Android phones will be
sold in 2013 (a figure that does not include tablets).
And most of these devices are backing up Wi-Fi
passwords as part of their default settings.
"Many (probably most) of these Android
phones and tablets are phoning home to Google, backing up Wi-Fi
passwords along with other assorted settings," he writes.
"And, although they have never said so
directly, it is obvious that Google can read the passwords."
This has been the default setting for Wi-Fi
passwords since version 2.2 of the Android operation system.
It's been presented as a positive feature for
users, one that makes it easier to save data and configure a new phone. But
for those who don't want the feature, it can be tricky to change. Depending
on which version of the Android platform you have, you either have to go to
"Backup my Data" or "Backup and Reset" to do the necessary configuration.
But it's not just your home Wi-Fi account.
Android phones are set to automatically remember
the passwords of any Wi-Fi network according to
the Register:
"The list of Wi-Fi networks and passwords
stored on a device is likely to extend far beyond a user's home, and
include hotels, shops, libraries, friends' houses, offices and all
manner of other places.
Adding this information to the extensive maps of
Wi-Fi access points built up over years by Google and others, and
suddenly fandroids face a greater risk to their privacy if this data is
scrutinised by outside agents.
These revelations are troubling for privacy
advocates who fear all this information is ripe for government cherry
picking if any U.S. intelligence agency were to compel
Google to give up
information on one of its users.
As
Micah Lee of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation blogged,
its reasonable to expect that these passwords are not secure in Google's
servers, readable by anyone.
"[T]he passwords are in plaintext, too," Lee
writes.
"When you format an Android phone and set it
up on first run, after you login to your Google account and restore your
backup, it immediately connects to wifi using a saved password. Theres
no sort of password hash that your Android phone could send your router
to authenticate besides the password itself."
It's a serious concern for the many who've
suddenly become more conscious of online privacy issues in the wake of
NSA leaker Edward Snowden's revelations
about the PRISM program for
monitoring and collecting data.
But Google is hardly the only company backing up
such information while trying to keep users in the dark.
As cryptographer Matthew Green
proved with a simple experiment, Apple is
storing user iMessages without user password or device key protection.
Similarly, files stored on
Dropbox and Microsoft's
SkyDrive are readable as
well.
But Horowitz says Wi-Fi passwords present a critical vulnerability.
When
contacted by ArsTechnica about this issue, a
Google spokesperson responded by highlighting the convenience of automatic
backup.
"Our optional Backup my data feature makes
it easier to switch to a new Android device by using your Google Account
and password to restore some of your previous settings.
This helps you avoid the hassle of setting
up a new device from scratch. At any point, you can disable this
feature, which will cause data to be erased.
This data is encrypted in transit,
accessible only when the user has an authenticated connection to Google
and stored at Google data centers, which have strong protections against
digital and physical attacks.
