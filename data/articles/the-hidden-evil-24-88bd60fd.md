# The Hidden Evil - 24

Effects
McKinney stated that the objective is to,
"force the individual to commit an act of
violence, whether suicide or murder, under conditions which can be
plausibly denied by the government."
The antagonistic public Mobbing of a target is
apparently intended to provoke an outburst, so they may end up incarcerated
or institutionalized.
Moret's analysis is similar.
She says,
"The purpose is to completely isolate and
remove all social support, economic support, and if possible, to drive
these targets to suicide."
"Isolation of the individual from members of
his/her immediate family... [is] virtually assured," proclaimed
McKinney, "when highly focused forms of electronic harassment commence."
Other objectives appear to be to separate a
person from friends and family, keep them unemployed, induce homelessness,
and reduce the quality of life so much that they suffer a nervous breakdown,
end up medicated, or hospitalized.
McKinney added that other "long-term objectives"
of these harassment campaigns, appears to be to,
"induce a sense of perverted 'loyalty'
toward the very agencies engaged in the individual's harassment..."
Moving to a completely new location will not
stop this.
All normal escape mechanisms have been removed
in all of the NATO countries. Reportedly, even when hospitalized, targets
are still harassed. Referring to the futility of moving to another location,
McKinney said "Your protocol follows you wherever you go so it's a waste of
time." "All of these harassment techniques are recurrent, they're
non-sequential, and they are overlapping," proclaimed Moret. "And basically
it's forever, they never leave you alone again. You're even followed out of
the country, [so] it happens in other countries."
Interestingly, if someone under investigation killed himself, most within
the sphere of the person's life would probably think this happened because
they had something to hide, not because they were repeatedly injured.
Therefore, bogus investigations may also provide a cover for an induced
suicide by creating the appearance of a "guilty conscience." "Suicides might
also qualify as 'staged accidents,' particularly where 'plausibly deniable'
government involvement has been surfaced," wrote McKinney.
Symptoms
Because the group harassment for Mobbing and The Hidden Evil are the same,
so are the symptoms. Some of the following symptoms have been taken from the
book, Mobbing.
They include:
-
Nervous breakdowns
-
Severe depression
-
Severe panic attacks
-
Heart attacks
-
Other severe illnesses
-
Suicide
-
Violence directed at third parties
-
Going postal
-
Uncontrolled acting out
-
Feeling suicidal and/or homicidal
-
Persistent anxiety
-
Fatalistic outlook on life
-
Frequent or longer sick leave or
disability at work
-
Isolation
According to Moret, Munzert, and McKinney, other
reported symptoms and situations are:
When I worked in Boston for about five hears,
each morning I'd pass by homeless people on the corner asking for money.
Usually I'd be thinking to myself,
"Now there's a perfectly healthy, able
person. Why don't they just get a job? I mean they're not lazy because
they're up at 7:00AM every day, standing on this corner asking for
money, why not be doing something constructive while earning money?"
It had never occurred to me that some of them
were probably Blacklisted and repeatedly Mobbed out of the workforce. I
never knew such a mechanism existed. Most targets would be homeless if it
weren't for friends or relatives.
So when you see someone holding a sign that
reads,
"Will work for food," know that they may be
targeted by The Hidden Evil.
It may be difficult for a person to conclude
that they've been targeted, and these groups may gradually turn up the
intensity of their harassment over a period of time.
This is the equivalent putting someone in a pot
of water, and slowly heating it until the water is boiling, i.e. they need
medication for anxiety or depression. "Many, many, many thousands, no doubt,
are involved [targeted]," declared McKinney. "But I would say the bulk of
those are running to their doctors and taking totally unnecessary
prescription drugs to cure ailments that in fact don't exist."
Earle noted that targeted people "are experiencing extreme traumatic
stress." The targets she said, "are subjected to a level of stress that the
average American cannot even imagine. They are constantly bombarded with
auditory information, with crises that have been created." Dr. Munzert
declared, "The victims experience extreme, unbelievable things; almost no
one can believe their reports." Once more, the covert psychological torture
that targets experience is identical to what East German targets received.
Former Stasi Chief Markus Wolf announced that the "psychological effects" of
the Stasi's harassment campaigns, "were probably more damaging, ultimately,
than any physical torture would have been." The Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists stated on July 1, 1999, that, "For many, the discovery that their
best friends or their own family members were betraying them to the Stasi
was worse, in its own way, than torture in an internment camp."
So far we've focused on illnesses that arise out of psychological
harassment. But in addition to this, targets often experience physical
symptoms resulting from Non-lethal attacks. McKinney described that many
targets experience, "Rapidly deteriorating health, generally of a digestive
nature," with "severe gastrointestinal disturbances."
One common DEW symptom is thermal heating which leaves a hot spot on the
skull.
"The objective of using microwaves," says
McKinney, "would be to inflict extremes of pain, [and] to cause thermal
heating." "Usually the victims experience pain... [in the] brain, heart,
[and] stomach," says Dr. Munzert.
"It's a little bit like being heated in the
interior of the body."
"And on the skin" he adds, "victims experience [what feels like]
hundreds or thousands of stings or pins."
If the energy is intense,
"the inner organs begin to vibrate," he
says. Dr. Munzert also states that these attacks are masked because
these symptoms and illnesses occur naturally.
This masking effect is compounded by the fact
that most people are not aware that these weapons exist or of their
capabilities. Some other DEW symptoms include:
Some other DEW symptoms include:
-
Memory loss
-
Dizziness
-
Headaches
-
Extreme fatigue
-
Sleep deprivation and disruption
-
Jolts and jerks to muscles (the
equivalent of being shocked)
-
Abdominal pain/nausea
-
Mental confusion/inability to
concentrate
-
Stings
-
Burning sensations
-
Heart attacks
-
Strokes
-
Aneurysms
-
Cancer
If you see a mental health professional as a
result of this covert violence, you may be misdiagnosed with a mental
disorder.
People with mental disorders are stereotypically
seen as incompetent and violent, according to a report entitled, Stigma of
Mental Illness Still Exists, by the Center for the Advancement of Health.
This will probably follow you for the rest of your life.
"Frankly I strongly recommend that you keep your faculties together and
avoid going to see physiatrists and psychologists, because the pattern that
is evolving is that they are highly complicit in these operations," advised
McKinney. Dr. Munzert agreed, indicating that care must be taken when
explaining this to doctors, in order to avoid ending up in the "lunatic
asylum." Reportedly, the harassment even continues inside hospitals and
prisons.
According to The Wheeler Clinic's article, Stigma and Mental Illness, if you
have been diagnosed with a mental disorder, you may have to answer to this
on job/school applications, or for insurance. The article stated, "Stigma
keeps people from getting good jobs and advancing in the workplace. Some
employers are reluctant to hire people who have mental illnesses. Thanks to
the American with Disabilities Act, such discrimination is illegal."
"But" they add, "it still happens! Stigma results in prejudice and
discrimination. Many individuals try to prevent people who have mental
illnesses from living in their neighborhood." While it may be illegal for
them to discriminate against you, good luck proving it. You may also be
denied certain licenses as a result. You can always lie, but they may find
out and you may be fined or expelled.
If you're an employed TI, you will probably be Mobbed. You should know that
EAPs work for the company and operate on the premise that if there is a
problem, it's with you. If you complain about Mobbing or a similar
phenomenon, they may recommend that you seek help from a mental health
professional. As concerned as they may seem, they may suggest this so that
you can be discredited later if necessary. According to Bruce Ennis, an ACLU
attorney who represents people denied of jobs due to mental illness stigma,
it's better to be an ex-convict in the job market than someone with a record
of mental illness. It's like a prison sentence that follows you wherever you
go.
Results of the Hidden Evil
Although at this point we have no way
of knowing how many people this affects, McKinney estimates that at least
many thousands are probably targeted.
"There are persons I have seen being
targeted... [who are] completely unaware of what's happening," she says.
"So those who are complaining of this are... as I've said, just the tip
of the iceberg. I would say this is probably very, very widespread."
Eleanor White, who has been targeted for over
twenty years, and has documented this program on her website,
www.raven1.net, sees this number as conservative. Based on a survey she
conducted in 2005, she estimates that the numbers are probably in the
millions. Consider that at one point in East Germany, 6 million people came
under scrutiny by the MfS, out of a population of about 17 million. That's
over one-third of the population. And mainstream media has told us that the
U.S. is poised to recruit double the informants of East Germany.
At this point it is difficult to estimate the amount of misdiagnoses,
suicides, miscarriages, deaths by cancer, and murders that this program has
caused. But in addition to the known cases previously mentioned, I've
included some below that occurred under curios circumstances. Over the last
ten years there has been an increase in the amount of people "going postal"
out in public and in the workplace. It is likely that the Hidden Evil has
played a role in this increase. People that have been Mobbed have been known
to go postal and kill themselves.
It would be very difficult to legally prove in a court of law that Mobbing
and The Hidden Evil contributed to the events below, especially since there
are currently no laws preventing this type of harassment. But, we now know
that some agencies have carried out mind-control programs and systematic
harassment in the past.
The stories that the victims describe are similar and the tactics are
consistent with ones employed in covert harassment campaigns, such as
complaints of recurrent harassment by multiple people, sabotage, setups,
etc. The symptoms such as depression, accidents (other illnesses), and
extended sick leave are also present. The symptoms victims experience result
in nervous breakdown, violence directed at third parties, suicide, murder,
and murder/suicide.
Beginning in 80s there was a wave of postal killings, giving rise to the
term, "going postal." There have been about 24 separate incidents of postal
violence since then including murder, suicide, and murder/suicide. Carefully
read the evidence in this section. If you examine these events you may see a
pattern in these seemingly senseless acts of violence. An identifiable
pattern in these cases includes the use of EAPs, nervous breakdowns,
followed by sick leave for psychological problems, and eventually suicide
and murder.
It may not be a coincidence that these postal offices are fraught with
horror stories of people murdering their family and coworkers. According to
author Alex Constantine, former members of the intelligence community are
often granted positions as postmasters. These offices are said to have been
used as labs for behavioral modification, and psychological harassment on
unwitting people. They have their own intelligence network within these
offices, which target and harass people. This harassment sometimes continues
no matter where they move to, or what environment they work in.
An article entitled $5.5 Million Awarded in Sexual Harassment Case, that
appeared in the November 6, 1996 issue of Employment Practices Solutions,
stated "A jury awarded $5.5 million to the family of a woman who was driven
to suicide... by her bosses and underlings at the Postal Service. They
accused her co-workers of intentionally botching jobs or missing deadlines
to sabotage her career." Apparently in an attempt to explain the covert
violence she was experiencing, one of her actions included, "leaving a
suicide note blaming the Postal Service."
Frequent harassment committed by multiple people, including superiors,
coworkers, and subordinates, directed at one person, which results in
suicide is Mobbing. Because the existence of The Hidden Evil and Mobbing are
not yet widely admitted, this article was mislabeled. There is no existing
category that targets of this violence fall into, other than being decent
people. Fortunately her family was able to focus on an existing law and win
the case. Did she experience public harassment too?
The Guardian ran an article on January 9, 2001 entitled, Suicide of Black
Worker Caused by Bullying. It stated that "Mr. Lee left a suicide note
addressed to his mother, Unnell, which said: 'Tell them it was nice playing
with me and they won.'" This man's father wrote an open letter to 1,500
postal workers in Birmingham seeking more evidence about the harassment.
"But instead of help, he received threats," stated the Guardian.
It continued, "Two other workers who claim they were bullied by colleagues
are on long term sick leave," and one woman suffered a "nervous breakdown."
Suicides, nervous breakdowns, and extended sick leave due to repeated
harassment by multiple colleagues, all signify Mobbing. This also
illustrates the group mind of staying loyal, and covering the system that
keeps them employed, no matter how sinister.
Mobbing targets sometimes go on sick leave and are unable to ever return to
the workforce. An environment of fear and danger is deliberately created,
where nobody knows who the next victim will be. To get an idea of what this
environment is like, picture a sinking ship where nobody knows if there will
be enough room for them on the lifeboat. The people who oversee these
operations are well aware that when people are put in an environment of
lingering death, the herd mentality will be activated, and cause a struggle
for survival. This brings out the worst in most people. This environment is
deliberately created for their sick amusement and control.
According to an article labeled, Report Links Violence, Local Postal
Management, which appeared in the December 22, 1998 edition of the Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel, the post office may have been responsible for some of
these murders. The article then went on to describe how programs specialist
at the post office were attributing the killings to "random acts of
violence," and that they were conducting their own version of an 800-page
report which would not link the post office to the killings.
In 1999 a postal inspector named Calvin Comfort was assigned to investigate
some of these postal killings. While doing so, he suffered a nervous
breakdown and had to take a year off. After returning to work he killed
himself in the parking lot outside the building. It's clear to me that this
was a message. He essentially told us that they did it.
Covering this story, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ran an article on April
2, 1999, entitled, Postal Inspector Kills Self Near Work. The article
stated, "A Milwaukee postal inspector who investigated the fatal 1997
shooting spree at the downtown post office took his own life outside the
same building... Comfort's investigation into the shootings seems to have
been at least partly responsible for a nervous breakdown he suffered..."
They continued, "Comfort was seen by a therapist available to employees
through their employee assistance program [EAP]. A separate report, to which
Comfort contributed, deals specifically with the events leading to the
shooting and is still unreleased. Inspector Rudy Green, is quoted in the
medical examiner's report as saying Comfort "has been under a lot of stress
since... he was the lead investigator in a homicide that occurred at the
Milwaukee main post office." Under a lot of stress? I'm convinced he was
violently attacked and murdered to prevent him from uncovering some
incriminating evidence. Was he also targeted by the Hidden Evil? In my
opinion, yes.
USA Today published an article on January 31, 2006, entitled, Ex-Postal
Worker Commits Suicide After 5 Die in Shooting. It stated, "A former postal
worker who had been put on medical leave for psychological problems shot
five people to death at a huge mail-processing center and then killed
herself in what was believed to be the nation's deadliest workplace shooting
ever carried out by a woman."
The article continued, "The attack Monday night was also the biggest
bloodbath at a U.S. postal installation since a massacre 20 years ago helped
give rise to the term 'going postal.'" Adding evidence to the charge that
these people already know who they're going to kill in advance, it ended
with, "chances are she might have known her victims." Of course she did,
they were harassing her.
Why would she go back to the post office to carry out these attacks after
being on sick leave for two years? It's apparent to me that she took revenge
where she believed her torment originated. My contention is that her
psychological problems were the result of mental injury, and that when she
left, she was never allowed to heal due to public harassment. They literally
kept beating her until she broke.
But the real sick part is that those who have these individuals under
surveillance during these harassment campaigns know exactly what they're
planning - and allow it to happen. They cause it. "Psychological harassment
and intimidation are carried out by hired specialists," wrote author
Constantine. The "U.S. Postal Service and other federal agencies draw on
their services."
The book Mobbing states, "Some may feel revengeful and direct their rage at
the Mobbers. Seeking revenge for their misery, they may 'go postal.'"
Regarding the lack of media coverage they conclude, "There is rarely a
report that identifies the deeper background of these tragedies." McKinney
arrived at a similar conclusion, and described a refusal of the mass media
to address this topic.
These are just examples, and this phenomenon occurs in many institutions. If
there was an actual unbiased investigation of suicides and murders caused by
this program, the post office may not necessarily lead other institutions.
The U.S. postal service has conducted its own $4 million dollar study to
disprove the myth that postal workers are more prone to violence than other
workers. One of their goals was to hopefully remove the phrase, "going
postal" from the language of mayhem. Apparently their study concluded
favorably that postal workers are no more likely to "go postal" than other
types of workers.
Summary
The objectives of the program are apparently to destroy a person from the
inside out, cause them a nervous breakdown, facilitate their hospitalization
or imprisonment, and force them to commit murder or suicide. These
objectives may be accomplished by the removal of economic and social support
structures, combined with repeated public and electronic attacks. Those on
the receiving end of public harassment may experience trauma as a result of
repeated injury.
Electronic harassment may additionally cause a variety of problems, up to
and including heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and aneurysms. Targets may be
misdiagnosed, labeled mentally ill, or be persuaded to take medication for
an illness that does not originate from within.
