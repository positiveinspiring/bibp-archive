MAN PROPOSES BUT GOD DISPOSES
... So speaking of ONE WORLD and of World Rule, a vision stirs of a
distant past, and of efforts towards World Rule in a smaller world of
another day; a past of which so little remains other than shattered
columns, cracked vases, a few precious metal coins and baked clay facsimiles
thereof, and the writings of relatively a handful of the best of a former
day, amongst which, strangely enough, still exist the works of the
propagandists for money power such as Xenophon, and, as some say,
Thucydides.
Behind these scattered fragments and the unseen but still existing remains
of millions of dead that lie beneath land and sea, consumed in the constant
wars of those ancient days, is the enigmatic vision of those half-Greek men
amongst their records in the counting houses of Athens and the Piraeus, and
the clear picture of them and their "Boy", Pericles, scion of that line of
the shifty Alkmeonidae, preparing under their guidance, plans for that
"Great War" which would extend their financial hegemony across the whole
Grecian world. If events proceeded along those lines in which they would see
to it that they were guided, then, who knows?
Perhaps as a consequence, their financial
hegemony might in time be brought to spread across the whole world. ONE
WORLD might, as a result of the scheming of their fevered brains, be
brought to reality...
This empire was now completely controlled by them. After Klearchos, and the
edict of 432 B.C. in which the Athenian allies were forbidden to use any
standard other than that of Attica, followed by the edict of 415 B.C. in
which the minting of silver was altogether forbidden them, the Athenian
Empire must have fallen totally under the control of the banks.
The edict
ordering the subject allies to contribute money instead of ships, meant that
they were to be drained of silver. When the silver was gone, they would be
obliged to come hat in hand to the Piraeus for that which the "Great"
Bankers were now lending as money against real collateral; entries in the
credit page of their ledger, or clay facsimiles of silver and gold money
which once had been...
This war would give the bankers complete control of Greece and all that such
could bring about through their financial guidance. None would flourish
from Colchis (1) to Illyria except they so willed it.
The instrument which
was Athens and its allies would finally and forever destroy that Spartan
hegemony in the Peloponnese that had so long denied them entry, and had
refused to accept their terms, and permit the circulation of that which they
through trade and money. All that proud Dorian aristocracy of the
Peloponnese would be exterminated, as these bankers had arranged long since
for the aristocracy of so many other states and cities of the world...
Their own future as a people destined to be lord over all, would be secure,
except those wretched political hacks of Athens could be called their peers... Gone forever would be the iron and leather money of the Lacedaemonians,
over whose issues they had no control, no foreign pedlars being permitted,
no "Businessmen", nor trade in imported luxuries...
So with this vision before them, the war would commence, and from that blood
and fire that they the bankers would see to it would sweep the land, could
come nothing but good for them as they planned in the shadows in the inner
chambers of the counting houses of the Piraeus.
These men knew that
whatever happened, and the result was certain so they estimated, finally
their agents would be permitted that which they wanted above all: permanent
residence in Sparta, and time consequently to spread the poison amongst the
people of Sparta which only they knew the brewing of to such perfection, the
poison of moral decay.
Under the stress of war, Sparta, through the agency
of its ageing king Archidamos, who was privately friend of the
banker's "Boy", Pericles, would secretly accept their terms, and permit the
circulation of that which they loaned as money, and permit private persons
to possess and hoard silver and gold, which, through the "Principles of
Banking" would soon be theirs in any case...
However it seemed as if even in that day it could be said: The best laid
schemes of mice and men gang aft a'gley!
A well planned stratagem that
should have established forever the banker's dream of world empire through
the creation of common money market embracing the whole world, and that
would have removed all remaining resistance towards the realization of such
dream, could they but settle once and for all the problem of Sparta, was
frustrated; and if something approaching such common money market finally
came about, it was not out of the original plan.
Plague spread in from
Egypt having originated in Ethiopia; Athens particularly was stricken and
by 427 B.C., three hundred knights, and four thousand, four hundred of the
armored hoplites drawn from the best of the Athenian middle classes, had
fallen, not to the enemy, but to the plague... Woe willed from on High!...
The deaths amongst women, artisans and slaves were much more. Not
merely were the formerly magnificent armed forces of the Athenians reduced
to virtual ineffectiveness, so far as the original plan was concerned, but
so was the civil war machine, economic or otherwise... sickness and death
struck all and the rotting bodies of
trapezitae or his slave were thrown on
the mass funeral pyres together with that of hoplite and his wife...
With
the flames consuming the dead, most of the immediate schemes of the bankers
turned into a wisp of smoke and disappeared into the heavens with an
accompanying odor of burnt flesh...
Those precious metal pieces, those copper fiduciaries, those clay
facsimiles, all those ledger entries, credits against no funds, money
created out of the thin air as by the hand of the gods, all these were the
secret of that endless urge and turmoil of the city states of Greece, and of
the tumult which finally culminated in the dark years of that miniature
"World War", out of which could come no winner but the International Money
Power.
The "Great Peloponnesian War", as it came to be called, saw a whole
system of life crumbling to pieces, just as did these last two so-called
"Great" world wars of our time; and still in the final ending not being
replaced by that system most longed for by those who have guided us so far
along this road of hopelessness...
In these brief moments of time since the fall of so much of ancient ways;
faintly discernible as beginning about the period of the collapse of the
Middle Kingdom in Egypt under the impact of the horses and chariots of the Hyksos, and that period of turmoil and destruction amongst which was the
fall of that Ur of Ibi-Sin, the last great ruler of Sumer before it was
eclipsed in its day of glory by all those Semitic peoples spreading
Southward, so that even its language almost disappeared. (2)
God seems to have more and more withdrawn
his face from mankind, now moving without guide along the uncertain ways of
time...
One thing stands out clearly from the fitting transfer of Ledger Credit Page
Entry Money, evinced by tattered fragments relating to man and his money in
very ancient days, and that is,
ONE WORLD!
Through the whole web of
confusion, this faint design grows clearly more distinguishable, concept of
those who by nature of their secret trade, money, standing apart from life,
think they know and understand all the paths of men and life; and because
of the international character of that which they now control, delude
themselves into believing that they, as designers of it all, rising into the
firmament as gods, shall be heirs to it all...
These secret classes who live shut in by the four walls of their
exclusivity, had originally believed that one more step would place them
forever on the now empty thrones of the god-kings who formerly reigned in
lordship over all; towards which place of all-power they had so long guided
themselves through the devious paths of knowledge of precious metal money
creation and emission, and all the deceits against mankind, to which it had
loaned itself.
With the establishment of the so-called United Nations
Banking complex via the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, otherwise designated "The World Bank", knowing no master on
this earth other than God or the Devil, as the case might be, and with
advent of the settlement of international trade balances PAPER GOLD, as the
final deceit, (3) these secret classes behind it all, well might believe
that the total of human activity, whether as towards War or Peace, depended
on their instigation alone.
With such triumphs resulting from the long
years of planning and waiting, well might they have been justified in
concluding that the end of a long and weary way towards
WORLD RULE had been
reached; perhaps the only question remaining being:
"Who should be the
Ruler?"
But for them already is the bitter assurance that this promised land, even
if faintly glimpsed, will never be; and that they stand on the same
threshold as the rest of the Indo-European peoples, if not mankind...
Beyond this threshold, where in the fatuity of their vain imaginings, was to
have been a money changer's World Kingdom, and for them and theirs, life
everlasting, are in reality the desolate ways of the gulf of time and
infinity, no less for them as for all...
Those absolute weapons dreamed
into existence as instruments towards the final realization of such world
kingdom, mainly through the genius of the Indo-European peoples, have also
been placed by the unruly agents of these secret classes, in the hands of
other races of the world; races who now thrust God-wards, and whose hearts
may be an ocean of envy, if not hate itself, for the same Indo-European who
now totters towards the grave to which he was being led, sick unto death...
And even should this ONE WORLD come to be, what of
INTERNATIONAL MONEY POWER
itself and its fatuous dream of a money changer's world dominion?... and
what will happen to it when the Indo-European who was its unwitting host and
protector for so long, is gone? for, except for some unforeseen change in
the course of events, gone he surely will be, and one or the other will have
taken his place as world leader...
The present day Chinese, for instance, who very well may be strong in the
competition for the throne of the gods from whence ONE WORLD would be ruled,
in the event of their accession to such throne, either by election, or by
force of arms, would not be likely to tolerate this finance core, privately
and irresponsibly controlled, and from which has been drawn the threads of
evil that have so long tormented the so called Indo-European world; which
long since has been totally entrapped in the web that has been woven.
No
more did the Chinese of ancient imperial days extend toleration to such
activities throughout their long history...
But it may not be doubted; little if anything will be left anyway...
Even should this world we know be spared total obliteration, after the
pestilence of decay, once again will be just shattered columns, crumbling
concrete, paper that turns to dust with the touch and ruin over all...
Life's urgent clamor will be followed by the silence of its extinction...
The brief and fading evidence of all this
turmoil will be but faint shadows on the accumulating dust...
THE END
....And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and
talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will show unto thee the
judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:
With
whom the kings have committed fornication...
So he carried me
away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a
scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy...
* * *
And upon her forehead was a name written, a mystery, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE
MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH
* * *
And he saith onto me, The waters which thou sawest where the whore sitteth
are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
* * *
And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the
kings of the earth
* * *
And the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived
deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall
see the smoke of her burning.
* * *
For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster and
all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by the sea stood
afar off,
* * *
And they cast dust on their heads and they cried weeping and wailing,
saying, Alas, alas that great city wherein were made rich all that had ships
in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made
desolate.

as the destination of the Argonauts, and, as abode of Medea, a special
headquarters for sorcery. An independent state at the time of Alexander,
when that area subject to Mithridates was invaded by Pompey, Colchis was
paying nominal homage to Mithridates. On his defeat it was made a Roman
