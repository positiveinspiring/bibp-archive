The Council on Foreign Relations
Congressman James E. Jeffries wrote,
"If the Establishment is elusive in its
identity, it certainly has a perceptible face in the Council on Foreign
Relations..."
Like its counterpart The Trilateral Commission,
the CFR is composed of Wall Street investors, international bankers,
foundation executives, members of Think Tanks and Tax-exempt Foundations,
ambassadors, past and present presidents, secretaries of state, lobbyist
lawyers, media owners, university presidents and professors, federal and
supreme court judges, and members of military leaders from NATO and the
pentagon.
It was formally established in New York, on July 29, 1921, as a counterpart
to a British group called, The Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA).
"The CFR and RIIA were originally intended
to be affiliates, but became independent bodies, although they have
always maintained close informal ties," wrote James Perloff, in his
well-documented book, The Shadows of Power.
CFR HQIts meetings are not open to the public
and membership is by invitation only.
Like the Trilateral Commission, its membership
list is publicly available. The CFR puts out a publication known as Foreign
Affairs which has been called "the most influential periodical in print," by
Time Magazine. They are located at the Harold Pratt House, 58 East 68th
Street in New York City, New York 10021. Pictured right is the CFR
headquarters at the Harold Pratt House.(*)
It was originally dominated by J.P. Morgan interests, and began to gain
momentum around 1927 with funding from the Rockefeller and Carnegie
Foundations. The founding president was John W. Davis, millionaire and
personal attorney of J. P. Morgan.
Some other early/founding CFR members included,
Henry Davison, Thomas Thacher, Harold Swift, W. Averill Harriman, John
Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, Thomas Lamont, Paul Cravath, Federal Reserve
architect Paul Warburg, Mortimer Schiff (Jacob's son), Morgan partner
Russell Leffingwell, and other Morgan partners.
Jim Marrs wrote in his book Rule by Secrecy that,
"Funding for the CFR came from bankers and
financiers such as Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Bernard Baruch, Jacob
Schiff, Otto Kahn, and Paul Warburg.
Today, funding for the CFR comes from major
corporations such as Xerox, General Motors, Bristol-Meyers Squibb,
Texaco, and others as well as the German Marshall Fund, McKnight
Foundation, Dillion Fund, Ford Foundation, Andrew W. Mellon Foundation,
Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Starr Foundation, and the Pew Charitable
Trusts."
The CFR created junior chapters in most major
cities called, Committees on Foreign Relations. These junior chapters hold
periodic dinner meetings.
Many researchers on this subject agree that there is an inner and outer core
of the CFR and its interlocking Think Tanks. Members of the outer ring are
just window dressing or camouflage, and are not aware of the motivating
factors of the inner-core. The inner-core appears to be members of the
steering and advisory committees.
Similar to the TC objectives, those of the CFR seem humanitarian on the
surface.
Describing this fa√ßade in his book, Who's Who
of the Elite, Robert Gaylon Ross explained,
"Let's start with the smoke and mirrors
furnished by the CFR in several of their Annual Reports."
Quoting a CFR Annual Report from 1993-4, he
said,
"The Council on Foreign Relations is a
non-profit, and non-partisan membership organization dedicated to
improving the understanding of U.S. foreign policy, and international
affairs through the exchange of ideas."
However, he states,
"if you are doing something illegal,
immoral, unethical, unpopular, and/or unconstitutional, you will do
whatever is necessary to see that it is kept secret."
Professor Sutton describes the CFR as,
"superficially an innocent forum for
academics, businessmen, and politicians, [which] contains within its
shell, perhaps unknown to many of its members, a power center that
unilaterally determines U.S. foreign policy."
He states that their true "subversive" objective
is,
"the acquisition of markets and economic
power... for a small group of giant multinationals under the virtual
control of a few banking investment houses and controlling families."
Former FBI Agent Dan Smoot observed the same
veil of deception. In his book, The Invisible Government, he wrote,
"The leadership of the invisible government
doubtless rests in the hands of a sinister... few."
Regarding the majority of members he stated,
"Many, if not most, of these are
status-seekers."
But warned,
"The ultimate aim" of the CFR, "however,
well-intentioned its prominent and powerful members may be" is "to
create a one-world socialist system."
When you see the word socialism think tyrannical
dictatorship, dominated by the big corporations and international banks.
"A number of individuals are apparently
invited into the CFR simply because they have a distinguished name or
other enhancing qualities," stated Perloff. He continued, "[they] join
without endorsing or even knowing the Council's habitual viewpoint."
"However," he said, "The membership's great
majority... have been chronically pro-socialist and pro-globalist."
Professor Sutton recognized,
"most members of the CFR have no knowledge
of this diabolical plan. But there is an inner core within the CFR
that... promotes it."
Regarding the media blackout, Allen observed,
"During its first fifty years of existence,
the CFR was almost never mentioned by any of the moguls of the mass
media."
"And," he added, "When you realize that the
membership of the CFR includes top executives from the New York Times,
The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Knight Newspaper chain,
NBC, CBS, Time, Life, Fortune, Business Week, US News and World Report,
and many others, you can be sure that such anonymity is not accidental."
Referring to the whitewashed Reece Committee
investigations which feebly investigated the Tax-exempt Foundations
interlocked with the CFR, Smoot wrote,
"The power of the Council is somewhat
indicated by the fact that no committee of Congress has yet been
powerful enough to investigate it or the foundations with which it has
interlocking connections and from which it receives its support."
He declared,
"In 1939, the Council began taking over the
U.S. State Department."
Admiral WardAdmiral Chester Ward, former Judge
Advocate General of the U.S. Navy, remained in the CFR for about 20 years
and co-authored a book entitled, Kissinger on the Couch, where he wrote,
"Once the ruling members of the CFR have
decided that the U.S. Government should adopt a particular policy, the
very substantial research facilities of the CFR are put to work to
develop arguments, intellectual and emotional, to support the new
policy, and to confound and discredit, intellectually and politically,
any opposition."
To the left we see Admiral Chester Ward (right)
swearing in William Frankey as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy.
The Admiral also warned that the goal of the CFR is the,
"submergence of US sovereignty and national
independence into an all-powerful one-world government."
In the August 1978 issue of W Magazine, former
CFR President Winston Lord is quoted as saying,
"The Trilateral Commission doesn't secretly
run the world. The Council on Foreign Relations does that."
Rene Wormser who served on the Reece Committee
investigating the multi-billion-dollar Tax-exempt Foundations and their
interlocks, wrote in his book, Foundations, that,
"The Council on Foreign Relations" is
"virtually an agency of the government," and that it is "financed both
by the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations, [and furthermore it]
overwhelmingly propagandizes the globalist concept."
Author Allen agreed when he wrote,
"The C.F.R. is totally interlocked with the
major foundations and [other] so-called 'Think Tanks.'"
Regarding the interlocking Think Tanks, Dan
Smoot explained,
"All of the organizations have federal
tax-exemption as 'educational' groups; and they are all financed, in
part, by tax-exempt foundations, the principal ones being Ford,
Rockefeller, and Carnegie. Most of them also have close working
relations with official agencies of the United States Government."
Referring to the CFR's infiltration into the
White House, Senator Goldwater wrote that the CFR has,
"staffed almost every key position of every
administration since that of FDR."
The senate was apparently concerned about the
influence and infiltration of the CFR into the White House.
Quoting a Congressional Record, dated December
15, 1987, vol. 133, Perloff wrote,
"Senator Jesse Helms, after noting the CFR's
place within the Establishment, put it this way before the Senate in
December 1987: The viewpoint of the Establishment today is called
globalism... Mr. President, in the globalist point of view,
nation-states and national boundaries do not count for anything.
Political philosophies and political principles seem to become simply
relative. Indeed, even constitutions are irrelevant to the exercise of
power..."
In an article called, School for Statesmen,
which appeared in the July 1958 issue of Harpers, CFR member Columnist
Joseph Kraft, proclaimed,
"It [the CFR] has been the seat of some
basic government decisions, has set the context for many more, and has
repeatedly served as a recruiting ground for ranking officials."
Allen commented,
"The policies promoted by the C.F.R. in the
fields of defense and international relations become, with regularity
which defies the laws of chance, the official policies of the United
States Government."
"Today the C.F.R remains active in working toward its final goal of a
government over all of the world - a government which the Insiders and
their allies will control," declared Allen.
"The goal of the C.F.R. is simply to abolish
the United States with its constitutional guarantees of liberty. And
they don't even try to hide it."
Study No. 7, published by the CFR on November
25, 1959, advocates,
"building a new international order [which]
must be responsive to world aspirations for peace, [and] for social and
economic change." This new order will include, "states labeling
themselves as 'Socialist' [Communist]."
Allen refers to the CFR as the "invisible
government," and says it is "unquestionably" the "most influential group in
America."
Former Agent Smoot concurs, writing,
"I am convinced that the Council on Foreign
Relations, together with a great number of other associated tax-exempt
organizations, constitutes the invisible government which sets the major
policies of the federal government."
Continuing, he said, the CFR,
"exercises controlling influence of
government officials who implement the policies; and, through massive
and skillful propaganda, influences Congress and the public to support
the policies."
He stated further that,
"the objective of this invisible government
is to convert America into a socialist state and then make it a unit in
a one-world socialist system."

Helms was not a CFR member at that time, but
joined later.
"We shall have world government whether or
not you like it - by conquest or consent."
-CFR member James Warburg,
testifying at Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on February 17, 1950
Regarding the CFR's plan for a single world
government, Perloff said,
"The CFR advocates the creation of a world
government." And, "Anyone who cares to examine back issues of Foreign
Affairs will have no difficulty finding hundreds of articles that
pushed... this concept of globalism."
"For decades," said Perloff, "the CFR pushed
this ascending approach to world government, with Foreign Affairs
carrying such titles as Toward European Integration: Beginnings in
Agriculture, Toward Unity in Africa, Toward a Caribbean Federation, and
so on."
He quotes a 1974 article which stated,
"The house of world order will have to be
built from the bottom up rather than from the top down... an end run
around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish
much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault."
Very few people are aware of the existence of
the CFR or its purpose. This appears to be the case with their interlocking
Think Tanks such as the Bilderbergers and the Trilateral Commission.
Perloff said,
"Today, probably not one American in five
hundred can identify the CFR, despite the fact that it is arguably the
most powerful political entity in the United States."
And Allen's estimate is higher; he comments,
"It is doubtful that one American in a
thousand so much as recognizes the Council's name, or that one in ten
thousand can relate anything at all about its structure or purpose."
Summary
The CFR is a supra-governmental organization that overshadows congress.
It is financed by the Tax-exempt Foundations,
and portrays itself as a humanitarian group. But its objectives are to erode
national sovereignty and merge America into a worldwide government under the
control of its members, which include people of tremendous wealth.
Basically, their goal is global fascism.
The CFR is responsible for setting major policy,
which is activated without public knowledge or consent. It is beyond
congressional investigation.
