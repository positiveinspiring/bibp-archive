VANCOUVER
Jon Kelly, a veteran CBS
producer who spent four years as Vancouver UFO Examiner, and
Alfred Lambremont Webre, an international journalist and war
crimes judge and former Seattle Exopolitics Examiner, announced
today on ExopoliticsTV they are launching a new "Inside-Out"
News agency with mainstream access, after concluding both their
reporting accounts had been terminated as a result of covert
censorship by a
CIA/Operation Mockingbird unit
at
Examiner.com.
"Inside-Out"
News
"Inside-Out" News agency will be a
cooperative of Truth journalists with contractual rights to
mainstream access and whose mission is to investigate and report
news that turns
the Matrix and consensual reality "Inside-Out",
and to deconstruct the memes of the Matrix, which is
the mission
of the current mainstream.
CIA
censors Jon Kelly exposé of Bill Cosby as CIA MKULTRA
disinfo asset
A "news censorship and
blacklisting timeline" (see below) shows that on Nov. 20,
2014 Examiner.com canceled and blacklisted Jon Kelly.
Mr. Kelly writes,
"Status: Highly plausible
offering context for an attempt by Examiner.com to
silence disclosure of Bill Cosby's
CIA MKULTRA
relationship (cited in the article) in mainstream news,
deny access to the publishing platform and journalistic
affiliation while inflicting economic damages upon the
author.
In 2003, Jon Kelly was
blacklisted from Coast to Coast AM for attempting to
report Arnold Schwarzenegger's role as a CIA operative
prior to the California elections."
CIA
censors Alfred Webre exposé of Barack Obama (Barry Soetoro)
as 3rd generation CIA operative, member of secret
1980s Mars teleportation program
On Nov. 22, 2011, while Alfred
Lambremont Webre was sitting as a Judge on the Kuala Lumpur
War Crimes Tribunal delivering a judgment holding Tony
Blair and U.S. President
George W. Bush
guilty of Nuremberg level war crimes for the 2003
illegal invasion of Iraq, the CIA/Mockingbird unit in
Examiner.com deleted Mr.Webre's expose of
Barack Obama as a secret member
of the CIA and its 1980s Mars teleportation program
on grounds that he was "publishing false news" and
blacklisted him from Examiner.com.
Ironically, Webre wrote,
"This judgment convicting
George Bush Jr. came on 11/22/11, 48 years after the
assassination of John F. Kennedy on 11/22/63 in Dealey
Plaza, Dallas, TX., where George Bush Sr., then an
undercover CIA agent, was photographed next to the Texas
School Depository.
George Bush Jr. is now
subject to arrest, prosecution and conviction of war
crimes by any one of 117 nations that are states parties
to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
The wheels of Justice grind slowly but they grind
exceedingly fine." [1]
[1] A call for
a consumer boycott of Examiner.com - "Boycotting Examiner.com is
simple: just avoid Examiner.com and tell your friends
and networks to do so as well."
Solution
- "Inside-Out", a news agency with mainstream access
As their conversation unfolds
(See video above), a solution to more widespread awakening
among the population is to ensure that the "Inside-Out" news
that Truth movement journalists such as Jon Kelly, Alfred
Lambremont Webre are creating have access to a wider arena
in the mainstream media.
Both Kelly and Webre have a
strong YouTube, Facebook, and website presences in the
awakened communities.
"Inside-Out" News will operate
on the basis of the same sort of mainstream access other
news aggregators like Examiner.com have, thus allowing their
stories on topics enter mainstream newspapers.
Launch details for Inside-Out
News will be announced in the near future.

CENSORED EXAMINER.COM ARTICLE BY JON KELLY
Bill
Cosby's Secret Messages Disclose MKULTRA 'Rape Demon'
by Jon Kelly
YourInnerVoice.com
November 20, 2014
Note: This article
was first approved as "news" by Examiner.com's editorial staff,
who then inexplicably reversed their position and pulled the
article down citing "it's innapropriate [sic]" content and
cancelled the 4.5 year-old column. A Google-driven search of the
Examiner.com website reveals hundreds of published articles
using uncensored versions of terms only alluded to below. A
Mockingbird-inspired agenda is clearly at play in light of how
the following report deepens existing public conceptions of Bill
Cosby's CIA MKULTRA affiliations.
Exclusive new video (below)
published to YouTube on November 20, 2014, purports to reveal
unconscious sleep talking-like disclosures from
Bill Cosby
in which the beloved activist and comedian seemingly reveals
involuntary forensic details of rape and abuse.
15 women now allege they were
victims in a decades-long pattern of sexual assault claims
involving the "Cosby Show" star.
An
Associated Press interview (below video) published on November 19, 2014,
offered audio samples as the basis for this controversial
independent study promising to reveal secrets behind the cryptic
way in which one of the reported wealthiest entertainers in
history responded to questioning.
The
Wall Street Journal emphasizes how NBC, Netflix and TV Land
have distanced themselves from the increasingly toxic Bill Cosby
brand in cancelling both a proposed new series and a stand-up
comedy special while pulling a "Cosby" rerun marathon from the
Thanksgiving schedule as well.
The former star of "I-Spy" played
the target of psychiatric
MKULTRA-like
brainwashing assassination attempts during a
1966 episode
titled "It's All Done with Mirrors."
Now he is the subject of online
mirror-reflected audio studies that attempt to discern indelible
truth encrypted within human speech and findings that indicate
unmet needs for healing, justice and closure.
The following analysis relies upon
applied phenomena of reflection that mirrors audio from the
exchange with Bill Cosby across the soundtrack timeline on a
digital audio workstation.
Effectiveness of this procedure has
been publicly demonstrated in applications where military and
forensic-grade intelligence concerning events of the Iraq War,
identification of the BTK Killer and UFOs in
Edward Snowden's NSA data cache was released prior to widespread acceptance as
matters of public record.
The partial transcript below
reflects spoken on-camera comments of Bill Cosby during the
taped November 6, 2014, exchange with the Associated Press and
the encrypted messages detected therein.
In the a-hole did
business daddy. Arrest n-gger:
"I know I didn't say anything but I'm asking
your integrity since I didn't want to say anything but I did
answer you. In terms of I don't want to say anything of what
value would it have?"
I win. The rape
man will get a series: "I
think if you want to consider yourself to be serious that it
will not appear anywhere."
They pass out.
Just f-ck and deal with them. The women choke:
"And we thought, by the way, because it was AP that it
wouldn't be necessary to go over that question with you."
You know she was
sobbing. Abuse. Suck him slow. I f-ck that a--:
"If you will just tell your boss the reason why we didn't
say that up front was because we thought that AP had the
integrity to not ask."
Help a demon
destroy. Sick. I'm awful:
"And I think you need to get on the phone with his person
immediately. Okay, thank you."
Striking parallels can be drawn
between the testimonies of alleged victims and the unconscious,
almost confessional language of the beleaguered star.
Janice Dickinson
told ET that,
"The last thing I remember was
Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and
getting on top of me. And I remember a lot of pain," as if
describing painful involuntary intercourse experienced under
the influence of drugs.
The supermodel spoke further of
"passing out" as did abstract expressionist artist Barbara
Bowman who recalled having,
"blacked out after having dinner
and one glass of wine at his New York City brownstone."
In reference to choking the former
aspiring actress
told MailOnline how Bill Cosby "used his forearm to pin me
down by the neck" while assaulting her on a bed.
Barbara Bowman believes that he
"manipulated her into believing he was a father figure" in order
to exploit her youth and vulnerability.
While the polite press
notes demons haunting one recent biography, bloggers are citing
Bill Cosby as a "Luciferian secret manipulator of men, CIA MK ULTRA
master and handler" while portraying the 1997 shooting death of
son Ennis Cosby as a Russian mafia hit.
The seeming Bill Cosby fixation with
eroticized violent choking invokes the deaths of David Carradine
and Robin Williams by asphyxiation.
Both actors were found hanging under
circumstances suggesting failed attempts at autoerotic
mechanical breath control. Repeated asphyxiation followed by
immediate resuscitation is said to be a form of torture employed
alongside anal intercourse in MKULTRA disassociation-focused
programming intended to produce Manchurian candidate assassins.
As writer, star and producer for
what may be his semi-autobiographical
1987 spy comedy
"Leonard Part 6," Bill Cosby is re-recruited (read: resurrected)
by the CIA to save the world from evil.
While Hollywood lampoons an emergent
surveillance state the non-fiction reality of MKULTRA is well
known to Canadians as the independent student newspaper McGill
Daily article "MK-ULTRAViolence or, how McGill pioneered
psychological torture" chronicles CIA and Government of Canada
co-sponsorship of illegal programs targeting vulnerable
populations that provided foundational research for widely-used
torture manuals.
Regarding current sexual abuse
allegations, corporate attorney for Bill Cosby, John P. Schmitt
says,
"The fact that they are being repeated does not make them
true. Mr. Cosby does not intend to dignify these allegations
with any comment."
In his 1977 comedy track "UFO" from
the album "My Father Confused Me... What Must I Do? What Must I
Do?"
Bill Cosby portrayed real
intellectuals as people afraid to show their feelings citing the
taboo accompanying discussions of experiential contact with
extraterrestrials.
In declining to clear the air
surrounding disgusting allegations of sexual assault, the
celebrity has invoked a personal code of secrecy destined to
shroud the twilight of his career in the kind of repugnant
darkness reminiscent of President Kennedy's 1961 memorable
warning.
The president instructed "The very
word 'secrecy' is repugnant in a free and open society."

Examiner publishes investigative news article with YouTube
video.

Hypotheses
1) Mistaken Identity: Examiner.com reviewers errantly approved the article then
correctly flagged it for inappropriate content. Status: Provably
false where thousands of instances of the same language (and
worse) already appear on the site. What appears on the site is
the de facto evidentiary content standard of Examiner.com.
2) Cognitive Dissonance: Upon
receipt of a support ticket detailing evidence of site-supported
inappropriate language, Examiner.com terminated the column as a
means of damage control. See Sterling Allan case in "Related
Incidents" below. Status: Plausible but does not explain why the
article was pulled after being approved.
3) Operative Cosby: Examiner.com responded to pressure from a CIA-like entity such
as that described in the findings of the Church Committee
describing how "The CIA currently maintains a network of several
hundred foreign individuals around the world who provide
intelligence for the CIA and at times attempt to influence
opinion through the use of covert propaganda.
These individuals
provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of
newspapers and periodicals, scores of press services and news
agencies, radio and television stations, commercial book
publishers, and other foreign media outlets." Status: Highly
plausible offering context for an attempt by Examiner.com to
silence disclosure of Bill Cosby's CIA MKULTRA relationship
(cited in the article) in mainstream news, deny access to the
publishing platform and journalistic affiliation while
inflicting economic damages upon the author.
In 2003, Jon Kelly
was blacklisted from Coast to Coast AM for attempting to report
Arnold Schwarzenegger's role as a CIA operative prior to the
California elections.
Journalistic Value
The Vancouver UFO Examiner is noted
internationally for exclusive original investigative reporting
into UFOs, ET Contact, Consciousness, Paranormal, Disclosure,
Exopolitics and related mainstream news as evidenced by nearly
100 "newsworthy"-approved articles with widespread distribution
and citations in major mainstream news outlets throughout the
English-speaking world.
Some of the most significant news
stories that appeared first in this column include Julian
Assange's UFOs, Edward Snowden's Psychic Human
Extraterrestrials, Kenneth Arnold's aliens, ET influence on
Canadian politics, extensive coverage of ECETI Ranch, Dennis
Hopper's Easy Rider UFO, British Black Ops in the Ukraine Sniper
Maidan Conspiracy, CIA involvement in the Ottawa shootings,
secrets of Russian spy Anna Chapman, Gabrielle Giffords' Sarah
Palin dreams, Robert Pickton's MKULTRA connection and the CIA Al
Gore sting attempt.
The column also broke substantial amounts of
new material and investigative reporting covering Vancouver and
British Columbia UFO incidents supported by multi-camera video
evidence.
Dishonest Conduct
Review staff lied to the author on
November 20 concerning non-available Bill Cosby Google News
submission credits upon approving article as newsworthy.

False Claims of Impropriety
In responding to questions as to why
the Bill Cosby MKULTRA 'Rape Demon' article was pulled,
Examiner.com Sr. Manager of Content and Media Access Gregory
Hunt cited "inappropriate content" as did review staff in their
reversal of position.
It is important to note that language
reported in the article is germane to the topic of sexual
assault and was spelled in the most conservative fashion
possible. The same may not be true regarding what appears in
great volumes on the Examiner.com website.
According to the
site's Google search tool, the following terms can be found in
quantity.
Examiner.com Word Usage Site
Statistics
Allegation - About 2,300,000
Bill Cosby - About 2,140,000
Rape - About 1,960,000
Ass - About 63,400
F-ck - About 10,100
Anal - About 6,240
Nigger - About 523
A-hole - Used in title: "Aaron
Hernandez 'acted like an a--hole' when cops arrived for domestic
dispute"
By the standards cited by
Examiner.com staff, it appears from the statistics above that a
significant portion of the Examiner.com website is
inappropriate.
Reversal of Status
How is an article first determined
by a professional reviewer as "newsworthy" subsequently found
"inappropriate?"
Escalation Absent Due
Process/ Following Unreasonableness Doctrine
The Vancouver UFO Examiner column
was cancelled subsequent to the removal of the article from the
site and submission of a ticket to the support desk. In response
to questions concerning what due or consultative process was
used to determine this course of action, Examiner.com Sr.
Manager of Content and Media Access Gregory Hunt cited terms of
use which state that Examiner.com reserves,
"the right to
terminate your access to or use of our Site for any reason or no
reason, in our sole discretion, with or without notice to you."
In other words, decisions at Examer.com are reached and acted
upon absent of reason.
