In recent months,
Lavabit, based in Texas, and
Silent Circle, based in Washington, D.C., both shuttered their encrypted
email services.
The companies said they couldnt keep them
running knowing they were vulnerable to surveillance if faced with a
dedicated enough attacker
which for Lavabit came
in the form of the federal government when it wanted access to NSA
whistleblower Edward Snowdens Lavabit account.
Now the companies are teaming up with plans to
offer an open-source tool that could make peer-to-peer, end-to-end
encryption an easy add-on for any email service. The challenging part: they
need to get other email providers - especially the heavyweights, Google,
Yahoo, and Microsoft - to join them in offering the tool.
The easy part: the name, which sounds like a
group of superheroes - or supervillains - depending on your perspective on
monitoring and data-mining email.
Lavabit and Silent Circle are the first two
members of the "Dark Mail Alliance,"
a group of email providers who will give users control over the privacy of
their email so that it cant be handed over to third parties, scanned for
ads, or easily hijacked by an interceptor.
"Were taking our inspiration
from the Rebel Alliance," says Levison. "Were the rebels who have decided
privacy is too important to compromise on. Were fighting to bring
privacy back to the Internet."
"We believe email is fundamentally broken in its
current architecture," says Silent Circle CEO Mike Janke, a former Navy
SEAL. "This is an opportunity to create a new email service where the keys
are created on the device and only the user can decrypt it."

The problem now is that - as the NSA leaks have
made us painfully aware - almost all of us store our email with third
parties and send it through a digital ether that has many stops along the
way where it can be captured.
On top of that, theres the possibility of our
email being hacked, or being scanned by advertisers, or just being opened by
a snoopy ex who has your password.
Google and others have tried to make
email more secure with two-factor authentication, but that doesnt solve
that fact that the email sits "in the clear" on a server or in the cloud
somewhere - a vulnerability that hackers can take advantage of.
According to
a new report from the Washington Post, the NSA has taken advantage of that
vulnerability
by infiltrating the links to Yahoos and Googles data centers.
Lavabit
and Silent Circle think email should be unreadable - decodable only by the
sender and the recipient. While its possible to set-up encryption on your
own, its a laborious process -
I know from experience; the Dark Mail Alliance hopes to streamline it.
Lavabit founder Ladar Levison and Silent Circle
CEO Mike Janke got to meet and swap tales of encryption woe during a privacy
event in Seattle in September.
Silent Circles impressive cryptography team
had been working on a better email encryption system for some time, that
wouldnt leak metadata to the provider (or the NSA) nor depend on keys
stored on a providers server.
Levison meanwhile had been fighting the feds
for months over their request to fundamentally break the security of his
email service in order to get access to one of his users accounts. Levison,
who has given up email since shutting Lavabit down, had downloaded Silent
Circles encrypted text messaging service to have private bi-coastal
conversations with his lawyer.
He and Janke connected via Silent Circle and
sat down in Seattle to talk about coming up with a new system together.
Levison then flew to Silent Circles headquarters for a week-long
project-crunching session with his former-competitors engineering team,
including master cryptographers Phil Zimmermann and Jon Callas.
The "Dark Mail Alliance" plans to release a
white paper about their tool, which relies on SMTP and XMPP.
While still a
work in progress,
-
it will assign a private key to a particular user and
populate it across their devices
-
put public keys and addresses into a
public server
-
store encrypted email for pick-up in the cloud
Its not
the first time technology of this sort has been deployed.
What would make
this different is that it, if successful, wouldnt be sandboxed. If Google,
Yahoo, Microsoft, Hushmail, and others signed on - and that is a big "if" -
youd be able to send an encrypted email from one service to another "easily."
Janke says the user interface is designed so that if youre
sending to an address thats part of the system, it glows green, and if its
not, it glows red.
"Features of PGP are built into the code itself
so it can function like regular email," says Levison. "We want to make it
easy enough for your grandma to use."
"We want community participation on the
protocols," says Silent Circle cryptographer Jon Callas. "But we are not
going to be sitting around, waiting for permission to do it. Were going
ahead with it even if its just the two of us."
"Were going to try to get as many people
involved as possible," says Janke. Levison announced the formation of "the
Alliance" Wednesday at Inbox Love, a conference at Microsofts Mountain View
campus for, as youd expect, mail geeks.
"All of the major email service
providers will be there," says Levison.
But will they want to join the Alliance?
Given Lavabits dramatic shutdown and
the Snowden revelations about the extent of
monitoring of our digital communications, theres momentum right now for the
cause of more private email.
And Lavabit and Silent Circle certainly have
the industrys attention.
"Everyone knows now that email is broken and has
to be fixed," says Callas.
But is that enough to get established providers
to join their crew?
"We want to get the Googles, the Yahoos and the
Microsofts to stand tall," says Janke. "But it will be an interesting
friction point. These companies make money by mining their free email."
The dark mail tool would prevent scans of emails
to deliver ads.
Another potential downside from a provider perspective is
that not being able to scan all emails will make it harder to root out spam,
says Levison. But they hope that the fact that all email would be signed
with particular keys will make it possible to develop a trust system around
identity.
Intelligence and law enforcement agencies
meanwhile, who have been complaining for years (perhaps disingenuously)
about the Internet "going dark," might be the most frustrated with the
Alliance. It would make it much harder to monitor peoples emails or to read
what they have stored in the cloud.
I asked Lavabit - who is
already fighting a court battle with the FBI - and Silent Circle whether
they worried about the government reaction to their plan.
Levison says he does worry about criminals -
terrorists and child pornographers - using the tool.
"But I balance that
with the need to speak privately as a fundamental part of any democracy,"
says Levison. "Government has brought this on themselves, where this kind of
security became a necessity."
"That horse has left the barn. If law enforcement wants that data, theyll
have to subpoena an individual [rather than their email provider]," says
Janke.
"I worry more about the big data processors.
Google and
Microsoft rely on data mining to
make their profits. I worry more about them collectively because
there is money on the line. I worry about that more than the nation
states."
The Alliance is not just focused on the big
dogs. Theyre also hoping to enlist smaller providers that want to offer
more private and secure email services.
Levison will play crypto-prophet,
with plans to rack up frequent flier miles to help providers and
organizations get this up and running when they release the tool in 2014.
"If we have to fly to Switzerland and South Africa, thats what well do,"
says Janke.
"We think the world is ready to embrace a new
system," says Levison.
