Informants
An Ancient Phenomenon
The use of citizen informant networks dates at least as far back as the
Roman Empire.
Delatores (informants) were recruited from all
classes of society, including knights, freedmen, slaves, wealthy families,
philosophers, literary men, court officials, lawyers, etc. Similar to the
TIPS program, it was an "all hands on deck" approach to empire security.
Setups were routine, and informants sometimes received a portion of the land
of those who they helped destroy.
More recently the fascist dictatorship of Portugal used the International
and State Defense Police (PIDE) as the main instrument of political
oppression. It consisted of secret police and a vast network of Bufos
(plain-clothed citizen informants), who were apparently on every block.
Money and a need for recognition (a pat on the back) motivated them. Second
only to the Stasi in its thoroughness, the PIDE neutralized all opposition
to the dictatorship.
Other countries have used massive citizen informant networks to destroy
perceived opposition to dictatorial rule as well. In Czechoslovakia they
served the Czechoslovak State Security (StB), and in Poland they worked for
the Ministry of Public Security (MBP). The citizen informants of the State
Protection Authority (AVH) ensured the survival of the Hungarian
dictatorship. Targets were harassed, threatened, confined to mental
institutions, tortured, blackmailed, and framed. Even their friends and
family were co-opted to persecute them.
Probably the best recent example of citizens Gang Stalking people on behalf
of the state is East Germany. In Germany the plain-clothed citizen
informants were called IMs (inofizielle mitarbeiter), or "unofficial
collaborators." Unofficial means that they unofficially worked for the
Ministry of State Security (MfS), also called the Stasi. For her book,
Stasiland, Funder interviewed former IMs, targets, Stasi Psychologists, and
professors who trained IM recruiters in Spezialdisziplin (the art of
recruiting informants). "The IMs," wrote Funder, "were 'inofizielle
mitarbeiter' or unofficial collaborators [plain-clothed citizen
informants]."
Funder continued, "In the GDR, there was one Stasi officer or informant for
every sixty-three people. If part-time informers are included, some
estimates have the ratio as high as one informer for every 6.5 citizens." In
his book, Stasi: The East German Secret Police, John O. Koehler agreed that
when you add in the estimated part-time IMs, "the result is nothing short of
monstrous: one informer per 6.5 citizens."
In Russia, the People's Brigades were told, "We have growing problems in our
country with enemies of the state. They operate internally, intending to
undermine the authority of our government." Sergei Kourdakov tells how he
was used to harass enemies of the state in his book, The Persecutor.(*)
These specialized groups were referred to as the Voluntary People's Brigade.
They were given a "License to harass," and charged with the "Maintenance of
Civil Order."
When they sprung up all over Russia they were directed by plain clothed
police on orders from Moscow. The citizens were told that they were part of
a "special-action squad" and would be given tasks that the regular police
couldn't or didn't have time to handle. They wore regular street cloths, and
were convinced that they were ordinary citizens aroused into taking action
against undesirables. Their leaders informed them that some of the people
they'd be harassing were worse than murderers.
So in Russia and Germany, these informant groups were basically told that
they were their country's first line of defense against threats to national
security and criminals. But where are they getting the hordes of citizens
who surround targets in public today? Well, they probably do pick people off
the streets and use door-to-door recruitment. But due to the shear number of
individuals now involved and the pervasiveness of this program, there must
be a blanket recruitment process.
A Familiar Pattern
Targeted people have reported that everyone from homeless people to
white-collar workers are participating in Gang Stalking. This also includes
neighbors, friends, co-workers and even family of targeted people. Federal,
state and local governments are reportedly complicit, such as local police,
fire departments, EMT personnel, city workers, utility companies, taxi
drivers, security guards, and stores and restaurants. According to Dr. Kilde,
other participants include, '"Down and out' people, jobless, freed
prisoners, mental outpatients, students and orphans." These people "are
trained by this organization to harass, [and] follow... innocent people, who
for whatever reason have been put on the organization's hit list."
The April/May 1996 issue of Nexus Magazine revealed that "Tens of thousands
of persons in each [Metropolitan] area," are now "working as spotters and
neighborhood/business place spies (sometimes unwittingly)." There is a legal
loophole that allows people to operate on behalf of the government, without
knowing it. Executive Order 12333 states that organizations used by U.S.
intelligence do not need to know that they serve U.S. intelligence
objectives. These spotters, it continued, are charged with, "following and
checking on subjects who have been identified for covert control by NSA
personnel." This helps to explain the Mobbing and Gang Stalking accounts of
targets both in the workplace and in public.
In order to sell the community on this program, its creators probably
equipped it with convincing propaganda, which is delivered by professionals.
Although there has been no official admission that the following federal
resources function as recruitment programs for public harassment, they are
similar to ones used in German and Russian dictatorships.
The Terrorism Information and Prevention System (TIPS), appears to be a
bulked-up version of a community-policing program. Even though TIPS was
officially rejected by congress, the American Civil Liberty Union contends
that it and similar programs are being used aggressively across the nation.
Other programs must have sprung up around the planet because the reported
tactics of Gang Stalking in other countries are similar.
But who is the threat? According to some of these documents at
www.citizencorps.gov, the targets are criminals and terrorists. However, the
definition of a terrorist in section 802 of the US Patriot Act is
frighteningly vague. Basically it defines terrorism as any action that
endangers human life or that violates state or federal law.
An article entitled, US Planning to Recruit One in 24 Americans as Citizen
Spies, which appeared in the Sunday Morning Herald on July 15, 2002,
provided us with another clue. It stated, "The Terrorism Information and
Prevention System, or TIPS, means the US will have a higher percentage of
citizen informants than the former East Germany through the infamous Stasi
secret police."
The articled revealed that the system is poised to recruit those whose work
provides access to homes, businesses, and public transportation systems.
Postal workers, utility employees, truck drivers, train conductors and
others are to be recruited. On "state and local" levels these informants are
to be directed by FEMA. This provides a motive for the reports of people
being stalked by 18-wheelers, busses, city, postal, and utility vehicles.
It continued, "Informant reports will enter databases for future reference
and/or action... [which] will then be broadly available within the
department, related agencies and local police forces. The targeted
individual will remain unaware of the existence of the report and of its
contents." This also helps to explain why inquiries by targeted individuals
regarding the harassment have been met with denial by friends, relatives,
neighbors, law enforcement, and colleagues.
In August, 2004, the ACLU, published a report entitled, The
Surveillance-Industrial Complex, in which it contended that there is
currently a vigorous citizen informant recruitment process. It stated, "Only
under the most oppressive governments have informants ever become a
widespread, central feature of life." Recognizing a familiar pattern, they
charged, "The East German Stasi... recruited from among the citizenry... as
many as one in every 50 citizens, to spy and report on their fellow
citizens." They warn that a "massive" recruitment effort is underway.
The New American stated in their October 7, 2002, article called, TIPping
off Big Brother, that the current effort to build a colossal network of
informants is being done to, "enlist American citizens in surveillance
activities that the state is either legally or physically unable to do."
They say, a society, "where neighbors, co-workers, and passersby are all
enlisted in a vast network of civilian informants - resembles conditions
that existed in Stalin's reign of terror, and in all modern totalitarian
states."
Continuing, they add, "Realizing that a cowed and brainwashed populace can
carry out surveillance better than a million trained agents, Communist
tyrants from East Germany to Cuba created revolutionary circles, youth
groups, and other organizations specifically to enable the Party faithful in
every walk of life to police everybody else."
On July 15, 2002, the Washington Times ran an article entitled, Planned
Volunteer-Informant Corps Elicits '1984' Fears, which stated, "1 million
informants" would be "initially" participating in a citizen informant
program. And that the program would involve a combined effort between the
DOJ, local police forces, as well as state and local agencies (businesses).
"At local and state levels, the program will be coordinated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency," they described.
"Critics," they added, "say that having Americans act as "domestic
informants" is reminiscent of the infamous Stasi" which targeted "dissidents
and ordinary East German citizens..." This evidence helps to explain how
stores and restaurants are participating in the harassment. In addition, it
appears that these informant squads are coordinated by local and federal law
enforcement.
According to www.citizencorps.gov, the directive of the informant program is
to "harness the power of the American people by relying on their individual
skills and interests to prepare local communities to effectively prevent and
respond to the threats of terrorism, crime, or any kind of disaster." This
may explain the reports of targeted people who allege that local, state and
federal workers are using skills within their profession as part of the
harassment.
For instance, city vehicles, postal vehicles, fire trucks, school buses, and
taxis are reportedly stalking people. Construction projects encircle a
targeted person's home and also spring up at frequently visited places.
Utility companies interrupt service. Local businesses provide poor service,
appear incompetent or clumsy and work with civilian informants to harass
targeted people in their stores.
In East Germany the IMs included doctors, lawyers, journalists,
sports-figures, writers, actors, high officials in religious organizations,
pastors, waiters, hotel personnel, and other workers. "Schools,
universities, and hospitals were infiltrated from top to bottom," wrote
Koehler. In other words, what Koehler is describing is that the controlling
faction of the organization was recruited into a policy set by the Ministry
for State Security (MfS), which was then filtered down to its workers.
Interestingly, when I asked a manager at a retail establishment in Medford,
MA if he had heard of Gang Stalking, he told me to "contact corporate
headquarters." In all likelihood these programs originate from the
organization's Corporate Headquarters that have adopted it as part of a
federal or state policy. The pattern that is unfolding is that all major
departments of the community are involved.
Other questionable programs include VIPS, Weed and Seed, Cat Eyes, and
Talon. Part of the Weed And Seed program calls for a combined effort between
local, state, and federal agencies, as well as community organizations,
social services, private sector businesses and residents, to "weed out"
undesirable individuals.
In a May 14, 2003 article entitled, Building a Nation of Snoops, the Boston
Globe stated, "Watching America with Pride, not Prejudice," is " the
Orwellian motto of the New Jersey-based Community Anti-Terrorism Training
Institute, or CAT Eyes." CAT Eyes is, "an antiterrorist citizen informant
program being adopted by local police departments," spanning from the east
to west coast.
The Globe described how this informant program was poised to recruit 100
million citizens! The program will, "dwarf the citizen informer programs of
the most repressive totalitarian states, making them appear amateurish by
comparison," they wrote. "Even communist East Germany," they proclaimed,
"was not as ambitious about citizen surveillance as CAT Eyes." According to
the Globe, the goal is to recruit one out of every three citizens.
Catherine Epstein at the Department of History at Amherst College, contends
that East Germany had the highest agent/informer to population rate in
history. So if the U.S. has implemented this or a similar program, it has
set a historical record. Former FBI Special Agent Ted L. Gunderson indicates
that eventually about one in ten people will unofficially work for the state
as an informant. In Germany the recruiters were given quotas to ensure a
minimal amount of expansion. Due to the shear number of people now
participating, I suspect quotas are being used.
They've recruited the youth
Children are now participating in the
Gang Stalking of targeted people. Infants too, are dressed in colors that
targets have been sensitized to. They are used as a billboard for symbolism,
as they're paraded around by their parents who encircle targets in public.
As demonstrated, after a target has been alerted that they're being watched,
this color essentially acts as a uniform and a weapon. Later as the infants
can walk and communicate they're used in other types of Staged Events
(Street Theatre). Even at young ages, these children are able to understand
how to perform these skits.
This program appears to be multigenerational, for both targeted people and
the stalkers. Reportedly, entire families are now participating in patrols
(Gang Stalking). Similarly, according to the book, The File, by Timothy Ash,
sometimes entire families were recruited as IMs in East Germany. At this
point we don't know exactly what these adults are told to encourage their
children to participate. But by their behavior, we can logically conclude
that the same factors which motivated them are used to get them to recruit
their children.
Reason indicates that after a parent has been recruited, a message similar
to, "there are bad people in the community and mommy and daddy need your
help," is conveyed to the child. The child then receives some type of
training and is used for patrols (Gang Stalking). Family participation also
seems to serve as a type of bonding, summed up by the adoption of attitudes
such as, let's work together to keep the community safe, we're the good
guys, etc. Consider that in East Germany, an astounding 6% of the IMs were
children.
Due to the number of youths participating, there must be a broad recruitment
program designed specifically for them as well. These programs are probably
offered in high school and junior high school. In 2000 and 2001, University
Wire, ran articles such as, Boston U. Adopts Crime Watch Program, and Police
Enlist Ohio State U. Students in War on Crime. The Atlanta Journal and
Constitution published articles in 2001 entitled, School Police Enlist Aid
of Students in New Crime Watch, and Student-led Crime Watch on Duty at High
School. Students Keep the Peace appeared in the October 2000 issue of the
Sarasota Herald Tribune. Some of these policing groups are restricted to
school grounds while others are not. Similarly, children were also recruited
as IMs in East Germany while at school.
But the organization which appears to the central point of recruitment for
youths, is the Youth Crime Watch (YCW), which is international in scope,
with headquarters on five continents. It is partnered with the Citizen
Corps' National Neighborhood Watch program, and works with adults to patrol
the streets. Schools are used as recruitment grounds for students from
grammar school up to the university level. Participants include all core
components of the local government, such as law enforcement, school staff,
businesses and restaurants, as well as adult citizens watch groups. After a
period of training, they conduct youth patrols under the supervision of a
nearby police officer or plain-clothed adult. Like their parent
organization, they're fighting crime and terrorism. They have at least
hundreds of thousands of members.
In addition to being used to carry out some of the standard tactics, the use
of children may also be intended to disgust TIs.(**) This appears to be a
triple attack. First, the act of someone using a child seems to be intended
to cause revulsion. Secondly, the understanding that a TI would probably not
be believed for even implying that a parent would involve their child in
something like this, appears to be intended to amplify the revulsion. After
all, nobody would ever, under any circumstances, use their children like
this. And thirdly, the act itself. Most of these parents seem to exhibit no
disgrace, which leads me to conclude that they believe it's a necessary
honor.
If children are being used in this program, and if there is a faction of it
which frames people for crimes, then is it possible that this faction would
use children to frame targeted people? All that the parents and child would
need to be told is that their country needs them to do something very
important as a matter of national security. If they're sufficiently naive,
they'll probably consider it an honor. Children of criminals, or those
vulnerable to blackmail or bribery, can also be recruited to accomplish
this.
A nation of Gang Stalkers
USAonWatch LogoMost of the citizen
informant programs previously mentioned are now organized under a National
Neighborhood Watch program, known as, USAonWatch.(***) "USAonWatch is the
face of the National Neighborhood Watch Program," declared the Citizen Corps
website. "The program," it announced, "is managed nationally by the National
Sheriffs' Association [NSA] in partnership with the Bureau of Justice
Assistance, Office of Justice Programs, [and] US Department of Justice." So
far, this information suggests that the program is coordinated locally by
the FBI and police.
The National Neighborhood Watch Program has existed since the late 1960s.
This helps to explain reports of people being Gang Stalked by citizen patrol
groups since the early 1980s. "For more than 30 years," proclaimed the
National Sheriffs' Association, "The National Neighborhood Watch Program, an
initiative of NSA, has been one of the most effective ways for citizens to
become involved with law enforcement for the protection of our
neighborhoods."
Neighborhood Watch is now partnered with Citizen Corps. And Citizen Corps is
run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the Department
of Homeland Security (DHS). Its website states, "Citizen Corps is
coordinated nationally by the Department of Homeland Security," and "works
closely with other federal entities, state and local governments." So in
essence, USAonWatch is a Department of Homeland Security program. This means
FEMA, DHS, the FBI, and local police are working directly with the state and
local governments to coordinate these operations.
So if USAonWatch is the current public front, then that would mean that a
portion of the Gang Stalking which targets speak of is done during these
citizen patrols. It would also signify that this network, with full
complicity of all levels of government, is trained and directed by local
police, working with FEMA and the FBI. Again, we find another parallel to
the Russian and East German dictatorships. The National Sheriffs'
Association exclaimed, "The Neighborhood Watch is Homeland Security at the
most local level!" It was created to "empower citizens to become directly
involved with Neighborhood Watch for the purpose of homeland security." Its
targets, according to the NSA, are criminals and domestic terrorists.
What else would the East German IMs do besides inform? Markus Wolf, a former
East German executive Stasi officer, and author of the book, Man Without a
Face, indicates that targeted people were Gang Stalked by "informers who
literally encircled their everyday movements." According to Wolf, the
residences of some targeted people were "put under siege," and every family
member, and every visitor, was kept under close observation. Even some East
German state officials were, "surrounded by unofficial informers for the
Stasi," proclaimed Mary Fulbrook, in her book, The People's State.
The book, Stasiland, reveals a similar citizen patrol scenario, where
targeted people would be stalked by a network of IMs on a daily basis. This
was done using a rotation of IMs. "In the morning when I went to work,
there'd be someone close behind me," reported one target. "[And] if I went
in to Alexanderplatz to do some shopping a man would come with me..." People
would be followed by IMs from their doorsteps, into public transportation
systems and then back home again. "They changed the personnel," she
continued, "but there was always someone there. They wanted us to feel it."
Despite what these IMs were told about threats to national security, this
blatant Gang Stalking was done for intimidation.
In 1974 the former Deputy Director of the CIA, Ray S. Cline, drafted a
report published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS),
at Georgetown University called, Understanding the Solzhenitsyn Affair:
Dissent and its Control in the USSR. It stated, "The Committee for State
Security" [KGB]... functions as a secret political police force, which
through nets of agents and informants, reaches literally into every crevice
of society." The word, "literally" is noteworthy, because when it is used,
they mean it. Just as with East Germany, you can bet that this means every
major area of society was filled with informants. This would include
workplaces, grammar schools, universities, businesses, restaurants,
apartment buildings, etc. Literally, everywhere!
The report continued, "By watching every critical echelon in society, the
informant networks also serve to insure that the administrative or daily
controls are in fact working." The Soviet Union was run by a small group of
wealthy elite. They used their private security force, the KGB, to ensure
their control. Although the surface claim for the existence of the networks
was for state security, it was in reality used to terrorize the population
into submission. "These informants," it sustained "serve the fundamental
purpose... of inhibiting people from speaking freely to one another; from
speaking out; from sharing and germinating thoughts."
Shockingly, according to an independent media report, there was an attempt
to integrate Markus Wolf and KGB General Yevgeni of Russia, into federal law
enforcement. An article entitled, Ex-KGB and STASI Chiefs to Work Under
Chertoff, appeared in the Foreign Press Foundation on December 16, 2004. It
explained how the U.S. would pay former Stasi officer Markus Wolf, and KGB
General Yevgeni Primakov to help co-op citizens into participating in
state-sponsored harassment.
The article was based on a U.S. Department of State Daily Press Briefing,
that occurred on June 9, 1997, which stated, "We're talking about Markus
Wolfe (sic), the former head of Stasi, right?... He actively aided and
abetted and fostered international and state-supported terrorism when he was
an East German government official..."
So, when they sprung up in Germany, they were called "IMs" who unofficially
worked for the "Ministry of State Security" to "protect the state" against
dangerous elements. They were called the "People's Brigade" in Russia, and
their duty was the "Maintenance of Civil Order." The current citizen squads
are apparently fighting terrorism and crime. I'm not aware of the official
names of groups which conduct these patrols in other countries; no doubt the
participating countries have assigned them noble titles.
According to this information, those who have been recruited into the
current citizen informant program include people who have access to homes,
businesses, and public transportation systems. Others include postal
workers, utility employees, truck drivers, train conductors, local police
forces, as well as local and state agencies. And, if these youth crime-watch
programs are being used for Gang Stalking - children. This helps to explain
the reports of targeted people who attest that a variety of local and state
vehicles are being used to stalk them. Restaurants and retail stores are
also involved. Employees, clerks and/or managers of these establishments
participate. If mainstream publications are alerting us to a "massive"
recruitment process, then what they're doing behind the scenes is probably
much more intense.
All of these volunteer Neighborhood Watch programs are sponsored by the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Interestingly, in East Germany, the
adults and children who Gang Stalked targets operated on behalf of the
Ministry for State Security (MfS). In Russia, citizen informants worked for
the Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (Committee for State Security),
also known as the KGB. In Czechoslovakia it was the Czechoslovak State
Security (StB), etc.
Because these harassment programs involve a combined, coordinated effort
between federal, state and local governments, logic would suggest that the
chief of police, mayor of the city, and governor of the state must be aware
of it. The program involves the use of too many resources for them not to
be. It can't operate without their knowledge. As previously described, the
TIPS or USAonWatch programs would have accomplished this.
East Germany had a variety of different types of informants, which served
different functions. So, in all probability, in addition to bulk recruitment
programs such as TIPS, and Neighborhood Watch, there are individuals and
groups of informants which are also recruited. In my estimation, these units
and individuals work alongside the public front organization to harass
people in public. If this is true, then this would further compartmentalize
these operations, possibly to the point where all of these factions are
unaware of the existence of one and other.
Consider the FBI's known use of criminals as informants, which was described
in the Tactics section. Also note an article which appeared in The Chicago
Sun-Times on May 31, 1998, entitled, Family of Spies on Run, which described
an, "unknown number" of entire families who are citizen informants. "They
are ordinary citizens who, for reasons ranging from petty revenge to pure
patriotism, agree to work with the bureau," stated the Times. The article
revealed that these families work with the FBI, DEA, CIA, RCMP, as well as
local law enforcement. Most of these agencies are now part of DHS. "Because
this is the lifestyle they have known almost since their birth, the...
children rarely complain," they wrote.
Secrecy
To my knowledge, at this time, no one has openly admitted to being part of
this program. Targeted people have been stonewalled when confronting their
tormentors in public. The citizen squads are obviously told that under no
circumstances are they to admit they're part of an organized program to
remove troublesome individuals from the community.
In Russia, the state emphasized the need for total secrecy when recruiting
people into the Citizen's Brigade. According to Kourdakov, during their
lectures they were told that, "Under no condition was the public to know
what was going on." The reason was that, "some people could misunderstand
what we're doing and why we have to do it," and "don't appreciate the danger
that these people represent to our society." When citizen informants in East
Germany were recruited, they agreed to a, "code of secrecy," and some had to
sign a waver, which stated that they would not mention anything about their
connection to the MfS.
By their behavior it is apparent that participants in the current program
are told that targeted people can't be reasoned with, but must leave on
their own accord, by way of a collaborative community effort. In all
likelihood, stigma is probably used to justify the harassment. This includes
labeling people threats to "national security," or criminals who have
escaped justice.
These tactics have been used in other countries to justify persecution of
political dissent. As part of their training, it is also possible that they
engage in skits where they witness people breaking down or fainting in front
of them, as a result of being systematically Mobbed out in public. Some of
the training is apparently designed to put their conscience aside when
harassing targets.
As we'll learn in the next chapter, when you
combine these desensitizing drills with lies, you can get most people to do
just about anything.
"As long as people believe in absurdities
they will continue to commit atrocities."
-Voltaire
Filtering
Another reason participants are told to deny their involvement in this
program is obviously because their handlers know that because they operate
on huge lies, they could not rationally justify the cause. It is critical
that participants receive no outside information that can penetrate this
barrier. Precautionary measures must have been taken to filter information
that would undermine the group objectives.
It has been said that those who do not learn from history are condemned to
repeat it. The people who created this program are obviously aware that it
is absolutely essential that no parallel be made between similar historical
events and what is taking place now. If this program originated from a Think
Tank, you can bet that they have accounted for this, and it has been
integrated into the training curriculum.
Therefore, certain phrases, such as "New World Order," "Dictatorship,"
"Cult," "Nazi Germany," "Hitler," "Cointelpro," MKULTRA," "Experimentation,"
"Gang Stalking," "Harassment," etc, are probably covered with mental
mindguards to disengage critical thought.
Similarly, according to cult expert Steven Hassan's book, Releasing the
Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves, these mental blocking
techniques are given to members of mind-control cults to reject information
that undermines the cult. It basically means that when they're confronted
with a particular phrase or question, they should think or say a certain
phrase to reject it. This is used to stop critical thought and funnel
external input into a mental recycle bin. It works remarkably well.
In his book, Vital Lies, Simple Truths, Dr. Daniel Goleman stated, "A
mindguard is an attention bodyguard, standing vigilant to protect the group
not from physical assault, but from an attack by information." "'A mindguard,'
says Janis [author of Victims of Groupthink], protects the group 'from
thoughts [information] that might damage their confidence in the soundness
of the policies to which they are committed.'" More on the Group Mind will
be covered in the next chapter.
The Nazis and their educated followers were essentially a political cult.
The cult was fed massive lies which were reinforced by the careful filtering
of information and propaganda conveyed by mainstream outlets. Literally, a
whole country was under this spell. This is happening now. "Hitler and his
troop of amateur magicians and hypnotists in the 1930's and 1940's were able
to reconstruct a technologically advanced nation such as Germany into a vast
theatre of illusion," stated Professor Marrs. "They were also able to induce
educated and intellectual [people] into becoming... oppressors of their
fellow men..."
Some may disagree, but arguably, this international group is a
political/corporate cult. Various cult experts themselves don't seem to
agree on any set definition. But in my view this group is a cult. More
evidence will be provided in the Structure, Purpose, and Motivational
Factors chapters to illustrate that this group is an essential part of a
massive political movement.
Communication
There is communication between the surveillance faction and the citizen
informant squads and local businesses in the area. Obviously, the managers
of local stores are contacted by a representative of this program, possibly
by cell phone, pager, or walk-in, and told to prepare for the arrival of the
targeted person. A picture or video of the targeted person may be shown to
the participating staff.
The targeted individual may also be identified as he or she walks into the
store. Consider that the IMs in East Germany communicated using non-verbal
cues, so this is also a possibility. When the TI arrives, those who have
been co-opted follow through with the tactics they've learned from their
training. They also work in unison with plain-clothed citizens to harass the
targeted customer. Advanced electronic methods of communication, which are
not commercially available, may be used by the coordinating faction to
direct specific citizen informants.
More than likely the current recruitment of informants is done using a
beneficial appearing program, equipped with convincing propaganda, which is
delivered by trusted authority figures. The recruitment programs offered to
the public probably don't refer to this activity as "harassment," or "Gang
Stalking."
In all likelihood it is cloaked in a beneficial sounding name. The behavior
exhibited by these citizens indicates that they are absolutely convinced
that this policy is legitimate and necessary. If it originates from a
government Think Tank, you can expect no less than an intellectual and
emotional masterpiece that is very cleverly delivered. This program was very
well thought out.
Friends and Family
Friends and family of targeted people are sometimes used to harass them. As
shocking as this sounds, identical tactics were used during Cointelpro.
According to the book, War at Home, by attorney Brian Glick, FBI records
reveal frequent maneuvers to generate tension (harassment) on targeted
people by recruiting their "parents, children, spouses, landlords,
employers, college administrators, church superiors," and others, into
investigations. The word "frequent" leads me to conclude that, just as in
East Germany, this was standard practice.
This helps to explain the current participation of friends, and family of
targeted people. Moret added, "What we've studied and reported and
identified is that neighbors are contacted and co-opted, [and] members of
the target's family are co-opted..." Similarly, according to Wolf, the
residences of targeted people were "put under siege," by the Stasi, and
every family member, and every visitor, was kept under observation.
The recruitment of friends and family of targets may not just serve to
harass, confuse, and isolate, but also as a discrediting strategy. After
all, a person's friends and family would never systematically harass them,
so someone complaining of such an ordeal must be mentally ill. This may be
compounded if a handler forces a targeted person's family to have the target
institutionalized. Remember, one in ten citizens will be recruited as
informants anyway, so co-opting ten or fifty friends/relatives of a targeted
person is not difficult.
How can a good friend or relative be recruited into a harassment campaign?
Simple. They can be lied to, intimidated, or blackmailed into becoming
informants during a bogus investigation. Then they can be given a gag order
and threatened with jail time if they mention anything about it. Both the
Stasi and FBI have done this. According to attorney Glick, blackmail and
threats, using statements such as, "We know what you have been doing, but if
you cooperate it will be all right," were often used as leverage for the
recruitment of a relative or associate during Cointelpro.
Family members or associates who targets have a shaky relationship with can
be bribed if they are greedy or in financial ruin. Naive ones or youngsters
can be lied to by appealing to their sense of patriotism. This would be
especially effective if delivered by a trusted community authority figure,
such as a local official. When gaining cooperation in this way, these
friends/family members may be fed some truth, and then some damaging lies
can be thrown in.
After the friends and family of a targeted person have been recruited, they
can be directed by their handlers to perform carefully scripted harassment
skits, which include some mentioned in the Tactics chapter. This harassment
by proxy is optimized by the use of sophisticated electronic surveillance
equipment.
Summary
Multiple citizen informant programs are now operational, with the goal of
recruiting a significant portion of the population. We've seen the political
Left and Right justifiably compare these informant programs to ones that
emerged in Germany and Russia. These programs are supervised by the
Department of Homeland Security. They are similar in operation and purpose
to those used in Russian and German dictatorships, which were created by the
Committee for State Security and Ministry for State Security, respectively.
Those mentioned to be recruited, reflects (to some degree), those reportedly
Gang Stalking targets. A massive network of citizens (probably millions
worldwide), stalk and harass targeted people in public. They include a wide
strata of individuals ranging from seniors to children, and often the
friends and family of targeted people. Local governments are fully complicit
in the harassment.
The federal government can also recruit groups or individuals as informants,
which are not connected to any official organization, such as a Neighborhood
Watch network. Without even being aware of the existence of the other
network, these entities too can be used to harass people in public.

* Although the portion of the People's
Brigade which Kourdakov wrote about didn't exhibit the exact traits as
the current global stalking group (due to the frequent use of overt
physical violence), his account does illustrate the emphasis on secrecy
with state-run harassment programs. Furthermore, the Soviet Union did
(and still does) possess a huge network of plain-clothed citizen
informants, which is used to stalk (shadow) enemies of the state. See
the report entitled, Understanding the Solzhenitsyn Affair: Dissent and
its Control in the USSR, edited by the former Deputy Director of the
CIA, Ray S. Cline. The report was based on a conference held by the
Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), at Georgetown
University.

which were obviously intended to convey sexual innuendos.
