A 2010 Rockefeller Foundation document entitled Scenarios
for the Future of Technology and International Development
outlines a scenario which results in the death of 13,000 during the 2012
Olympics.
Rise of
Authoritarianism
The first worrying prediction begins in 2012 when the pandemic the world
had been anticipating for years, finally hits, infecting nearly 20 percent
of world population and claiming 8 million lives.
Due to this pandemic, the Rockefeller Foundation
outlines how the public will welcome a more authoritative government and a
tighter control across all aspects of life, including
Biometric IDs for all citizens.
The 2012 London
Olympics Bombing
In the document, the Rockefeller Foundation predicts that the decade of
2010-2020 will be named The
Doom Decade, because of a wave of terrorist attacks, natural
disasters as well as civil uprisings and financial collapses.
The years 2010 to 2020 were dubbed the doom
decade for good reason: the 2012 Olympic bombing, which killed
13,000, was followed closely by an earthquake in Indonesia killing
40,000, a tsunami that almost wiped out Nicaragua, and the onset of the
West China Famine, caused by a once-in-a-millennium drought linked to
climate change.

Mirroring events in real life, the document also
predicts that by 2015 a large share of the US armed forces are recalled
from countries such as Afghanistan to be stationed domestically, apparently
posse comitatus no longer being a
concern.
In 2015, the U.S. reallocated a large share
of its defense spending to domestic concerns, pulling out of Afghanistan
- where the resurgent Taliban seized power once again.
As is happening right now, the document outlines
how nations will lose power over their own finances due to massive debt,
apparently handing over financial sovereignty to the banking technocrats.
But the document doesnt just cover these topics. The growing mistrust in
vaccines is covered in the Rockefeller document, where they state that due
to corruption within national and global bodies such as WHO, bogus
vaccines will result in mass deaths.
According to the paper, the resulting mistrust
in vaccines results in a large number of parents who avoid vaccination,
which causes infant and child morality to rise to levels not seen since the
1970s.
In the context of weak health systems,
corruption, and inattention to standards - either within countries or
from global bodies like the World Health Organization - tainted vaccines
entered the public health systems of several African countries.
In 2021, 600 children in Cote dIvoire died
from a bogus Hepatitis B vaccine, which paled in comparison to the
scandal sparked by mass deaths from a tainted anti-malarial drug years
later.
The deaths and resulting scandals sharply
affected public confidence in vaccine delivery; parents not just in
Africa but elsewhere began to avoid vaccinating their children, and it
wasnt long before infant and child mortality rates rose to levels not
seen since the 1970s.

Technology becomes an increasing theater of
battle in the Doom Decade, with cyber terrorism and hacking mafia
organizations becoming more and more widespread.
A worrying prediction outlined in the document
covers Bio-Hacking where GMO and DoItYourself-Biotech push the Globalists
love
for Transhumanism forward.
Interestingly, not all of the hacking was
bad. Genetically modified crops (GMOs) and do-it- yourself (DIY) biotech
became backyard and garage activities, producing important advances.
In 2017, a network of renegade African
scientists who had returned to their home countries after working in
Western multinationals unveiled the first of a range of new GMOs that
boosted agricultural productivity on the continent.

Just as desired by Globalists for over a hundred
years, the developed world begins to fall back into feudalism, with the gap
between the rich and poor growing to levels not seen for hundreds of years
as the middle class becomes extinct.
The rich moving into fortress like compounds, whereas the poor are forced to
move into ghettos.
By 2030, the document portrays the developed
and developing nations to no longer be relevant or distinguishable.
Agenda 21
The report also outlines several Environmental scenarios stemming from
Climate Change which include a new
worldwide economic system based on Green Infrastructure by 2018.
The Foundation describes how the resulting collapse of society requires an
exodus out of rural areas and into urban environments for survivability, a
bizarre take on reality where those living in urban environments are far
more restricted in being self sufficient than those in rural areas who have
the ability to more easily grow their own food.
Another mirror to
Agenda 21 is the documents prediction that
only the very rich will have the ability to travel, as prices skyrocket and
the restrictions in the name of security reach such high levels that the
poor simply cannot travel from their communities.
Conclusion
As with other such documents such as those released by RAND and the MoD in
the UK, these predictive papers are a window into the think-tanks who
help shape world events.
Where the documents are always portrayed as
simple predictions, it is important to realize that many such papers have
been eerily accurate in the past and thus must be considered when such
events unfold in the near future.
