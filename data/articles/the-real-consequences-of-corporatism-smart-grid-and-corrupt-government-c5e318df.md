Our leaders have become
blinded by money.
At the federal level, the illusion of
representative government is now over.
With a few exceptions, for-profit interests have
colonized government systems that were originally intended to serve people.
The danger of allowing this virus to continue, of course, is that the
casualty always eventually becomes life itself. Like any virus.
Presented to you is
Exhibit A:
'Chief telecom industry lobbyist Tom Wheeler
now chairs the FCC.'
This is yet another
FDA-Monsanto-esque revolving door of
corruption, which sidelines the rights and safety of an entire nation.
Activists rallied to call out FCC chair Tom
Wheeler (below image) on January 9 in San Francisco, and will be
directly addressing the CPUC on January 16.
Reuters interviewed
one veteran Washington telecom
insider, who spoke anonymously:
"All of the senators
in the Commerce Committee know Tom as a lobbyist who funnels funds to
them, not as a stand-up guy from a regulatory agency who is able to take
heat."
Wheelers career has been dedicated to
obsessively expanding the telecom industry to what it is now:
an uncontrollable behemoth in league
with
the NSA and its ilk.
And a facade which intentionally suppresses an
avalanche of scientific evidence for the harm it is causing.
According to thousands of scientific studies,
the inescapable truth is that Big Telecoms cell phones, towers, and the
offshoot "smart"
networks which have spawned and are spidering throughout
neighborhoods in the western world are harming all biological life - from
the whole being down to the cellular level.
Smart Meters - Exposed
This is the conclusion presented from,
literally,
thousands of peer-reviewed studies.
View a Take Back Your Power clip, exposing what
utilities are not telling about health risks from smart meters:
Despite the unconscionable practice by Wheelers
wireless industry to systematically cover all this up,
skew the science, invent fake studies and
oppress dissident researchers, the truth is becoming obvious.
Or maybe not, if youre one of perhaps several
million
who have had symptoms after having a
"smart" meter installed - such as inability to sleep, increasingly foggy
thinking, ringing in the ears, headaches or heart palpitations - but havent
connected the dots as to the cause.
Last Thursday, activists brazenly
called Wheeler out during his recent visit to San Francisco. And this
coming Thursday, they will
face down corrupted power brokers at the California Public Utilities
Commission.
The so-called "smart" grid infrastructure
facilitates unprecedented illegal data-mining by utilities and government,
made complete with
utility meters that enable their colonization of your home.
NOTE: The CPUC has admitted
plans to take the detailed in-home data harvested by "smart" meters, and
sell it on the open market. And the US
Government and Department of Justice have done a
secret deal which facilitates the sharing
of data harvested from "smart" grids, exempting utilities and other
industries of any wrongdoing. Take
notice that
there is no requirement to allow a "smart" meter on your home.

These facts make it clear there is much at stake
for our civilization, and this needs to be spoken of openly, stripped of
propaganda. The movement at present is teetering on the edge of mainstream
awareness.
The handicap we face:
Its hard for people to conceive
that industry
and government
can be this corrupt -
that this could actually be happening.
But unfortunately, it is.
Of course, all of this is illegal. And its
based on boldfaced lies, misinformation and propaganda. The show has been
taken over. There is no oversight left in town.
No agency or department
within this broken-down system is coming to our rescue.
Solutions
Corruption has no capability to auto-correct.
Intervention is required.
"When wrongs
are pressed because it is believed they will be borne, resistance
becomes morality."
-Thomas Jefferson
The global power-grab charade will continue
until we realize the power to change and to create is in us.
We have the rights - innate in our very
existence - and we have been giving them away. We have
allowed ourselves to be hypnotically seduced by un-conscious propaganda
designed to have us gratify ourselves, not take responsibility, not
challenge so-called authority, and generally be a technologized lemming.
These are programs of self-imposed limitation
and of fear; catching the human race off-guard and hijacking thought.
In the film After Earth, Cypher Raige
(played by Will Smith) succinctly put it this way:
"Fear is not
real. It is a product of thoughts you create. Do not misunderstand me.
Danger is very real. But fear is a choice."
Remember this:
to whatever
one fears, ones power follows.
If we are fearing repercussions of speaking
truth, or being on some corporate agencys watch list, or being a social
"weirdo" - then its not us whos really living. Its a conditioning
program which weve allowed to call the shots.
All of this may seem like fiction-come-to-life -
and perhaps it is. This global play is run by kids with magnifying glasses
and anthills. They just never grew up.
But theres now an open casting call out for
directors, actors, and production crew who can still remember the plot.
