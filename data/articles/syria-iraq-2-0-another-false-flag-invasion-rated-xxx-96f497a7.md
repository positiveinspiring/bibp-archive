# Syria - Iraq 2.0 - Another False-Flag Invasion Rated XXX

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_middleeast81.htm

Sadly no matter how questionable or
fabricated the pretext is, it appears that there is nothing we can do
except sit back and watch the U.S. and its surrogates invade and decimate
yet another nation.
The whole Syrian scenario is right out of
the Iraq-Afghanistan invasion playbook.
We know that the U.S. and its
surrogates, including NATO, Sunni Arab partners and Israel, are all
waiting for a pretext and preparing for an invasion of Syria and Iran.
They want to invade for resources and pre-planned geopolitical goals,
this is a given, the only problem is there has not been enough of a
reason to, until now.
Thanks to whom? Once again, Fox News.
Beginning with the events of 9-11, the
catalyst for the
Project for the New American Centurys plans for global
military domination, up until today, we have seen the U.S. run rampant all
over the world invading, killing, droning, assassinating and
over-turning governments at will.
It began with Afghanistan, a country that
had no connection to 9-11. We now know they knew that and invaded
anyway.
It was their plan and they manipulated the media to bring it
about. A plan spearheaded by Fox News, which also helped the
neo-conservatives usurp the office of the U.S. Presidency to install
George Bush, the spread lies and disinformation connecting Afghanistan
to 9-11 so the American people would sheepishly goose-step alongside
those hungering for war.
Claims connecting Afghanistan to 9-11 were
later found to be false but that has not mattered. An invasion is an
invasion, it doesnt matter to the U.S. how many brown people they kill in
Afghanistan on false claims. This act of aggressive war was a crime
against humanity, but no one will ever be brought to justice and no one
will ever dare to prosecute.
Iraq was not connected to 9-11 either, but
the U.S. tried to claim they were. Hussein never allowed al-Qaeda to
operate in Iraq.
That claim did not work, so the U.S. cooked up the whole
Yellowcake story, claiming Iraq was attempting to produce nuclear
weapons. That was found to have been a lie too. Fox News was
on the job there too.
Then there was the 45-minute WMD lie. These
lies were even presented to the United Nations and repeated over and
over again by Fox News and U.S. Officials. Even the Director of the CIA
knowingly promoted a lie and was forced to resign. But apparently
Americans have forgotten all of that.
Iraq was
nothing but lies, Husseins only real crime was the fact that they
day before the invasion he changed Iraqi oil trade and foreign hard
currency reserves from the dollar to the Euro and was not as pliable as
the U.S. had wanted.
Something few people have chosen to remember but a
very key fact. Remember the weather balloon trailers and the Iraq
chemical weapons lie? Fox News broadcast that so much that even when it
was known to be a lie it was almost accepted truth.
The aggressive invasion of Iraq and the
execution of its leaders was also a crime against humanity for which no
one has had to answer for. Another war crime and crime against all
civilized people all over the world is the terror prison at Guantanamo
Bay Cuba. It is a place to keep and torture men who were defending their
families and homes from foreign invaders who wanted nothing but to rape
their countries of its resources and rob its people the right to
self-determination.
The continued dronings and extra-judicial
executions, the daily kill lists, the manipulation and over-throwing of
governments, the list goes on and on. These are all war crimes and
crimes against all of humanity, for which no one has yet been prosecuted
and which no country is seemingly able to stop.
Then of course we had Muammar Gaddafi and
all of the lies associated with the invasion and destruction of that
country with thousands more dead at the hands of the U.S. and its NATO lap
dogs, another place where resources were needed and another leader who
stopped trading oil in dollars.
Where did it all start?
Yugoslavia and the
invasion and genocide on the Serbs, also an invasion based on lies for
which no has ever paid a price. Yugoslavia was the litmus test for the
West and its resource-and-geopolitical-plan invasions. Had they been
stopped there the world would be a different place today.
The United States has been usurped by madmen
and lunatic killers bent on forcing the entire planet to its knees by
force.
Maybe those are strong words but that is the truth. Just like a
brutal cop who murders and then places a cold gun in his dead victims
hand, the U.S. is rolling through the world like a cancer, killing and
invading at will. They will invade Syria and Iran, and then like that
cop, come up with the reason later, and like that cop they must be
stopped.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt that
the U.S. will lie about and produce evidence of anything under the sun
if it will allow them to carry out their military adventures. Then why
should we be surprised by or believe anything they say now with regards
to Syria, in particular the claim that President Bashar al-Assad has
chemical weapons.
The U.S. has long ago lost any and all
credibility and needs to be locked in a padded cell and have all of its
weapons removed forcibly before it kills any more people.
Unless one is suffering from loss of long
term memory all of the above facts should be enough to cause alarm, and
the hairs on the back of the neck to stand on end when a news outlet
like Fox News, which has lied and lied again, tells the world Syria has
chemical weapons. War lie, invasion to come.
When it comes to the lies on Syria, well
they have been going on for years. We just learned that Egypt Air
resumed flights into Damascus because they found out all of the reports
of violence around the international airport
were lies.
The fact that slimy looking Leon Panetta, dressed in his
thousand dollar mafia-thug suit, gets in front of a microphone trying to
look all worried while having trouble making his eyes meet the
reporters, as he states he is,
concerned the regime might very well
consider the use
of chemical weapons, just doesnt get it.
Where is the proof?
That
is what the international community should be asking, and if the U.S. is
lying, yet again, which I am sure it is, the world needs to seriously
look at ways of disarming the most dangerous aggressor on the planet.
So as the U.S. media attempts to plant the
gun, U.S. troops are being amassed on
the Syrian border readying for an invasion of Syria, NATO agrees to
"augment Turkeys air-defences," the invasion of Iran also
appears to be closer.
NATO has officially
entered the Syrian crisis and even Germany has signed up for yet
more mindless
U.S.
led bloodshed.
Syria itself has denounced NATOs actions
and U.S. and German statements. UPI Asia reports that Syrian Deputy
Foreign Minister Faisal Miqdad said,
"Syria stresses again, for the
10th, the 100th time, that if we had such (chemical) weapons, they would
not be used against its people.
We would not commit suicide."
Fox needs to do better than citing "unnamed
senior officials" to allow the U.S. to fulfill its dream of punishing
President Assad.
As U.S. President Barack Obama said that the
use of chemical weapons by the Syrian authorities will serve as a "red
line" which, if crossed, will be followed by the punishment of
President Bashar al-Assad.
-
Is the world going to sit by as the
out of control American killing machine comes up with yet
another false pretext to invade yet another country, decimate
its population and assassinate its leader?
-
Is there anything
the world can do?
-
Sadly, it looks like the answer to
that question is no. Should we do something?
Absolutely, but it may be too late...
