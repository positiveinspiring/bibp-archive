Back in October we noted a scheme, linked to the Hillary Clinton campaign, to tie Julian Assange and WikiLeaks to a pedophilia ring (see "Hillary Clinton Linked to Mysterious Front Associated with Julian Assange Pedophile Smear").
Of course, the scheme was revealed amid daily dumps by WikiLeaks of John Podesta's emails leaving the Clintons, and their many "friends in high places", scrambling for anyway possible to shut Assange down.

Therefore, it should probably come as no surprise that the former Interior Minister of Iceland, Ogmundur Jonasson, has now come forward to reveal details of a 2011 plot by the Obama administration to frame Julian Assange.
According to a report from RT, the U.S. first contacted Icelandic authorities in June 2011 to offer "help" in fending off hackers that the U.S. said were looking to destroy software systems in the country.
Jonasson was initially "suspicious" of the U.S. offer to help, suspicions which he said were confirmed later in the summer of 2011 when a "planeload of FBI agents" showed up in Iceland seeking support in an effort to "frame Julian Assange and Wikileaks."
In June 2011, Obama administration implied to Iceland's authorities they had knowledge of hackers wanting to destroy software systems in the country, and offered help, then-Interior Minister Ogmundur Jonasson, said in an interview with the Katoikos publication. However, Jonasson said he instantly became "suspicious" of the US good intentions, "well aware that a helping hand might easily become a manipulating hand." Later in the summer 2011, the US, "sent a planeload of FBI agents to Iceland seeking our cooperation in what I understood as an operation set up to frame Julian Assange and WikiLeaks," Jonasson said.

Icelanders seemed like a tough nut to crack, though.
Jonasson ultimately refused cooperation with U.S. efforts and sent the FBI agents home saying that if he had to choose sides he,
...would be on the side of WikiLeaks. "Since they had not been authorized by the Icelandic authorities to carry out police work in Iceland and since a crack-down on WikiLeaks was not on my agenda, to say the least, I ordered that all cooperation with them be promptly terminated and I also made it clear that they should cease all activities in Iceland immediately," the politician said. "If I had to take sides with either WikiLeaks or the FBI or CIA, I would have no difficulty in choosing: I would be on the side of WikiLeaks," he said. Jónasson went on to discuss other whistleblowers like Edward Snowden: the Althing, the Icelandic parliament, debated whether Snowden should have been granted citizenship, but, "there hasn't been political consensus" on the matter. "Iceland is part of NATO and such a decision would be strongly objected to by the US," Jonasson said.

Of course, none of this is particularly surprising coming from an administration that wanted to "just drone this guy."
