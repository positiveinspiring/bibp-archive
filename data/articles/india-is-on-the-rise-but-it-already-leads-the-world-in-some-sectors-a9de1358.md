The IMF
predicts that cash shortages will gradually dissipate, with
economic growth
picking up to 7.2% in 2017/18.
Which sectors are fueling the
Indian economic engine?
India is now an
established technology powerhouse.
Home to 40% of
the countrys IT industry, Bangalore has emerged as the most
dynamic city in the world ahead of Silicon Valley (Jones
Lang LaSalle's annual City Momentum Index, or CMI).
It's time to
move on from the clich√©s about call centers and outsourced IT
services. Bangalore is a real technology hub, with dozens of new

Delhi.
Prime Minister
