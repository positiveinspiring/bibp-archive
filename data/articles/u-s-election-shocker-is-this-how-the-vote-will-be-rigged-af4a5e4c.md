Votes are being counted
as fractions instead of
as whole numbers.
As we know, there are a number of ways to rig an election. Bev Harris, at blackboxvoting.org, is exploring a specific "cheat sheet" that has vast implications for the Trump vs. Hillary 2016 contest. It's a vote-counting system called GEMS - Global Election Management System. I urge you to dive into her multi-part series, Fraction Magic (Part-1 here).
Here are key Harris quotes. They're all shockers:
"Our testing [of GEMS] shows that one vote can be counted 25 times, another only one one-thousandth of a time, effectively converting some votes to zero." "This report summarizes the results of our review of the GEMS election management system, which counts approximately 25 percent of all votes in the United States. The results of this study demonstrate that a fractional vote feature is embedded in each GEMS application which can be used to invisibly, yet radically, alter election outcomes by pre-setting desired vote percentages to redistribute votes. This tampering is not visible to election observers, even if they are standing in the room and watching the computer. Use of the decimalized vote feature is unlikely to be detected by auditing or canvass procedures, and can be applied across large jurisdictions in less than 60 seconds." "GEMS vote-counting systems are and have been operated under five trade names: Global Election Systems Diebold Election Systems Premier Election Systems Dominion Voting Systems Election Systems & Software, ...in addition to a number of private regional subcontractors. At the time of this writing, this system is used statewide in, Alaska, Connecticut, Georgia, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Utah and Vermont, and for counties in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. It is also used in Canada." "Instead of '1' the vote is allowed to be 1/2, or 1+7/8, or any other value that is not a whole number." "Weighting a race [through the use of GEMS] removes the principle of 'one person-one vote' to allow some votes to be counted as less than one or more than one. Regardless of what the real votes are, candidates can receive a set percentage of votes. Results can be controlled. For example, Candidate A can be assigned 44% of the votes, Candidate B 51%, and Candidate C the rest." "All evidence that [rigged] fractional values ever existed [in the GEMS system] can be removed instantly even from the underlying database using a setting in the GEMS data tables, in which case even instructing GEMS to show the [rigged] decimals will fail to reveal they were used." "Source code: Instructions to treat votes as decimal values instead of whole numbers [i.e., rigging] are inserted multiple times in the GEMS source code itself; thus, this feature cannot have been created by accident."

A contact who, so far, apparently wishes to remain anonymous states the following about the history of the GEMS system:
"The Fractional vote [rigging] portion traces directly to Jeffrey W. Dean, whose wife was primary stockholder of the company that developed GEMS. He ran the company but was prohibited from handling money or checks due to a criminal conviction for computer fraud, for which he spent 4 years in prison. Almost immediately after being released from prison he was granted intimate access to elections data and large government contracts for ballot printing and ballot processing."

I see no effort on the part of the federal government, state governments, or the mainstream press to investigate the GEMS system or respond to Bev Harris' extensive analysis. It's not as if media outlets are unaware of her.
From shesource.org, here is an excerpt from her bio:
"Bev Harris has been referred to as 'the godmother' of the election reform movement. (Boston Globe). Vanity Fair magazine credits her with founding the movement to reform electronic voting. Time Magazine calls her book, Black Box Voting, 'the bible' of electronic voting Harris's investigations have led some to call her the 'Erin Brockovich of elections.' (Salon.com) Harris has supervised five 'hack demonstrations' in the field, using real voting machines. These have been covered by the Associated Press, the Washington Post, and in formal reports by the United States General Accounting Office " Source

So far, her analysis of GEMS seems to be labeled "too hot to handle."
Press outlets prefer to report the slinging of mud from both Presidential candidates' camps. Meanwhile, the actual results of the coming elections - including Congressional races - appear to be up for grabs, depending on who controls GEMS.

- Report Shows 91% of Americans Didn't Want Clinton or Trump - by John Vibes August 02, 2016

A recent report published by The New York Times has pointed out that an overwhelming majority of Americans, 91% of them in fact, did not support or vote for Clinton or Trump in the recent primary elections. The figures were calculated from statistics that were gathered by,
the U.S. Census Bureau Federal Election Commission Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections The Sentencing Project the Pew Research Center
the U.S. Census Bureau
Federal Election Commission
Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections
The Sentencing Project
the Pew Research Center
The figures illustrate that scores of people living in America are not allowed to vote, and are considered ineligible due to their age, prior arrests, or incomplete citizenship applications. In total, there are 103 million people who are essentially banned from voting, so this demographic would technically fall into the category of people who did not support Trump or Clinton in the primaries, although their actual preference can't be determined. Furthermore, there is an increasingly significant portion of the US population that is deciding not to vote on principle, because they don't feel particularly enthusiastic about any of the candidates. It was determined that 88 million people who were eligible to vote, did not vote in the primaries, and will not be voting in the general elections either. These are principled non-voters who have refused to put their consent into a system that they don't believe is legitimate. Of the Americans who do plan on voting in the main elections this November, most of them didn't vote in the primary elections. According to the report in the Times, an additional 73 million did not vote in the primaries this year, but will most likely vote in the general election. In total, roughly 60 million people voted in the primaries, with about 30 million voting for Republicans and another 30 million voting for Democrats.
The funny thing about this, though, is the fact that most of these voters supported other candidates in the primaries since there was a wider group of politicians from which they can choose. Although Clinton and Trump did finish in the lead, they only needed a very small percentage of eligible voters to win the nomination. When looking at the overall level of support they have among the average American, that number is even smaller.
Together, Clinton and Trump had the support of roughly,
14% of eligible voters and 9% of American residents in general
14% of eligible voters
and 9% of American residents in general
This may seem strange, but this is actually the case in every single election.
The vast majority of American residents do not vote, and thus it would be safe to assume that at least a significant portion of these nearly 200 million people would prefer to have no president at all.
