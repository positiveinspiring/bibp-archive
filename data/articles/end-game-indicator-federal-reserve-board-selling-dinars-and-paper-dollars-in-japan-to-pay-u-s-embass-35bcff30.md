In a sign the
Federal Reserve Board crime syndicate is on
its last legs, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, Japan is selling Iraqi Dinars
and U.S. dollar cash bills via yakuza gangs in order to pay its bills,
according to yakuza sources.
The bills are being sold via corrupt officials
in the Tokyo public prosecutors office who are then selling them to yakuza
gangsters in exchange for Japanese yen, the sources say. One Iraqi Dinar was
worth $3.8 before the U.S. invaded but fell to 2 cents afterwards at which
point the Feds bought them all up, according to MI6 sources.
They are now selling them worldwide, along with
blacklisted U.S. paper bills in order to keep the Federal Reserve Board and
its Washington D.C. subsidiary going a bit longer.
Buyers beware because you will sooner or
later find out you traded good money for high quality tissue paper.
The Feds are not the only ones having troubles these days. Except for a rump
of brainwashed slaves in a few Western countries, most of the world is now
fully aware that,
...are attacking Libya purely and simply in
order to steal oil they can no longer afford to pay for.
This campaign is not going well, however,
because Africans, Eastern Europeans, Chinese and other peoples are helping
Libya maintain its independence from the neo-colonialist bandits.
A shadowy international group calling itself the
Dark Brotherhood went further by issuing a warning to Frances
Sarkozy that his criminal acts against Libya, Japan and other countries will
result in a suitcase nuclear bomb being set off in La Defense, the high rise
government district near Paris.
The
White Dragon Society strongly disapproves
of the mass killing of innocents by any group, including both the
Brotherhood and the French.
These incidents are all indicators that the world is no longer accepting
credit card payments from the U.S., the UK, France and other countries who
then turn around and spend their borrowed money financing needless wars of
aggression. These countries have, in recent years, financed their chronic
external deficits with fraudulent financial instruments but the world is now
on to these scams which is why time is running out for the war-mongerers.
The
Vatican has remained silent since the attempt two weeks ago by
the Black Pope, Peter Hans Kolvenbach
to cut a deal.
Kolvenbachs proposals to the White Dragon
Society had some merit.
-
First he offered to cash $1 trillion or
so in Federal Reserve Board bonds to finance the formation of a
new U.S. government headed by U.S. Senator Ron Paul and
former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
-
He also agreed to allow the mass arrests
of junior
Bilderberger and
CFR members so long as the top
ranks remained immune.
These proposals were rejected for a variety of
reasons.
One was that it is the American people and not a
self-described representative of Satan, who should be choosing their
leaders. The other is that he asked for a 6-month delay which meant he was
probably just trying to buy time and did not intend to keep his
promises.
Another is that he does not have any God
given right to go around creating $1 trillion out of thin air in order to
manipulate society. Also, Kolvenbach made veiled threats, including threats
against Japan and the White Dragon, as a matter of principle, never submits
to extortion. If him and his cabal did not have their magic dollar printing
machine, most of them would just be street trash.
However, if this writer was an American citizen, he would certainly vote for
a
Jesse Ventura/Ron
Paul ticket.
In what may be a related development, a group of 10 U.S. Senators led by
Senate Majority leader Harry Reed are in Macau, China for some sort of
negotiations. These almost certainly involve secretive Japanese financier
Seiichi Wada, who has in the past served as a conduit between Western
oligarchs and Chinese leaders.
It may also be no coincidence that a White
Dragon Society representative was given a free air ticket and invited to
Macau at the same time. We shall know more when the representative returns.
Also, as mentioned last week in our free blog, a group known as the
International Red Socialists has allied itself with the White Dragon
Society. In a meeting that took place in a very funky secret Japan
headquarters located in the posh Ginza district of Tokyo, the Reds explained
they had global reach and that they were at least equal in influence to the
Red and Blue in China.
They gave the impression of being nice, and
peace-loving but ready to defend themselves if absolutely necessary.
In Japan, meanwhile, there are reports that Prime Minister Naoto Kan
is having fits of tears and hysteria because of the stressful situation he
finds himself in. However, the objective truth is starting to prevail and
attempts to create mass global nuclear panic over the nuclear accident, in
Japan are failing in the face of the hard scientific truth that nobody has
died of radiation poisoning as a result of this limited incident.
Instead, evidence that Japan was deliberately attacked with a earthquake and
tsunami triggering seabed nuclear weapon is mounting.
For example, archivists have uncovered a series
of newspaper articles in mainstream Japanese papers like the Asahi and
Yomiuri Newspapers reveal the
use of nuclear earthquake weapons was
commonly reported on here in the 1950s, 60s and 70s.
The Japanese right wing/military/yakuza/police
establishment is also now aware that,
...are the prime suspects in this attack.
What these people need to realize is that their traditional methods of
control, brute force, bribery and lies are just not working anymore.
-
They no longer have the ability to
dominate the rest of the world through brute force
-
They no longer control the money needed
to bribe leaders into obedience
-
Their lies are now being uncovered
almost as fast as they can tell them
The oligarchs need to realize that a fundamental
historical shift is taking place and they cannot stop it, the best they can
do is surf it.
If they miss the wave, they will miss a
historical opportunity such as they will never see again.
