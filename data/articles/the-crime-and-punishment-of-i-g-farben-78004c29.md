From 1938 to 1946, Joseph Borkin was the chief of the Patent and Cartel section of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice in Washington, and was responsible for the wartime investigation and prosecution of the cartels dominated by I. G. Farben. During the war, he published Germany's Master Plan which led the Associated Press to say: "Joseph Borkin probably knows more about I. G. than anyone outside of it". Since 1946, Mr Borkin has practiced Law in Washington and he has written numerous books and articles. He is chairman of the Federal Bar Association's Committee on Standards and Judicial Behaviour, a lecturer in the Catholic University Law School, and Director of the Drew Pearson Foundation.
In the councils of Government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.
PRESIDENT DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THE NATION JANUARY 17, 1961 WASHINGTON, D.C.
