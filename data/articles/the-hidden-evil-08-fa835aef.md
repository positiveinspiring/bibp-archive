Commentary
There can be no denying that these organizations have infiltrated the
executive branch.
According to this information, it began with the
documented overthrow of the true government in 1913 and continued with the
appointment of members of elite Think Tanks into the executive branch.(*)
First with the CFR, then the Bilderbergers and finally the Trilaterals. The
infiltration by the Tax-exempt Foundations and the interlocking Think Tanks
was done by the "power of the purse," according to the Reece Committee
hearings.
There is a heavy cross membership between those in control of the
foundations and the elite societies. The Tax-exempt Complex is essentially
their private multi-billion-dollar bank account. There is a strong interlock
between the elite societies, the owners of mainstream media, the
foundations, the Federal Reserve, Wall Street, the multinational
corporations, and international banks. This cabal controls the United States
and other NATO governments.
Once the deciding members of these Think Tanks settle on a policy,
significant resources are pooled to promote the policy, which filters down
to the local government. Opposition is met with ridicule by an array of
organizations which the elite use to confound and discredit their critics.
And in their own publications, they've made their intentions perfectly clear
- a removal of the constitution and individual freedom, and the creation of
a one-world government with them in control. This will be an absolute
nightmare of a dictatorship.
On August 30, 2003, Congressman Ron Paul was addressing an audience near
Austin Texas and was asked if there existed a "deceptive conspiracy to
overthrow the American Republic" and "Bill Of Rights" and to "usher in a
totalitarian World Government," under the control of the UN.
He answered,
"Yes. I think there are 25,000 individuals
that have used offices of power, and they are in our Universities and
they are in our Congress, and they believe in One World Government. And
if you believe in One World Government, then you are talking about
undermining National Sovereignty and you are talking about setting up
something that you could well call a Dictatorship."
Obviously, no presidential candidate is allowed
to get close to the White House without being owned by this cabal. Although
voting fraud probably does exist, the elections themselves are apparently
scams, which offer the illusion of choice.
This explains why there have been no major
positive changes throughout multiple administrations.
"Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to
the accidental opinion of the day; but a series of oppressions, begun at
a distinguished period, and pursued unalterably through every change
of... [administrations] too plainly proves a deliberate, systematic plan
of reducing us to slavery."
-Thomas Jefferson
In his book, How the World Really Works, Alan B.
Jones wrote,
"the elites who wish to set up their world
dictatorship recognize their main enemy to be the great middle class of
the United States, which, being made up of individuals who have acquired
a little education, property, and independence, will fight strenuously
to keep them."
"The strategy," says Jones, "of the elites is to squeeze the middle
class to death by creating or exacerbating the major problems facing the
society, including class warfare, crime, education, moral decay, etc.,
and then creating in response spurious governmental programs to "cure"
the problems that they just created."
What Jones is describing here is the financial
elite's consistent use of the Problem-Reaction-Solution formula.
"I have two great enemies, the Southern Army
in front of me and the Bankers in the rear. Of the two, the one at my
rear is my greatest foe."
-Abraham Lincoln
Now that you have an understanding of the real
power behind the throne, in upcoming chapters we'll explore how these
organizations have manipulated some major world events. But first let's
examine their control of mainstream information more closely.
This will help explain why you may never have
heard of them, or the authentic version of how some historical events
occurred.
Footnotes
* Former presidents, such as Garfield and
Lincoln have attested to having running battles for the republic with
the international banks and corporations. So some researchers may
contend that this overthrow occurred at an earlier date, and they may be
correct. Other authors suggest that despite winning the Revolutionary
War, the United States was never truly removed from the grip of British
Royalty. They too may be correct. But I listed 1913 as it was documented
as an overthrow in a Congressional Record dated December 22, 1913, vol.
51, and echoed by Congressman Louis McFadden. This evidence was provided
in the Federal Reserve section.
