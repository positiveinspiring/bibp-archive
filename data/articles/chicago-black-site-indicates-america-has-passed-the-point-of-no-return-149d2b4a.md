This past week, the creepy "Homan Square" detention facility was revealed to the public, and the story has been trending heavily throughout the alternative media.
First person accounts of suspects being whisked away to the secret building without any official record of their whereabouts, with no access to a lawyer, while being subjected brutal interrogations, sounds like something you'd hear about from some '3rd world' dictatorship. But unfortunately, it's happening right here in America as we speak.
And if this facility existed for so long without the public's knowledge, that begs the question:
are there any more of these police run "black sites" that we don't know about?
Obviously, this doesn't inspire a lot of confidence for America's future.
If they can get away with this today, what will they try tomorrow? I don't think any sane American thinks this will set a good precedent.But more importantly, if you look at Homan Square from a historical perspective, the implications of its existence are far more gut wrenching. Most despotic regimes utilize a wide variety of terror tactics to keep their people in line, but the ability to make someone disappear (which is exactly what this facility is capable of) is the most effective.Why? Because it preys upon two of the most prolific human fears.
First of all, there is our inherent fear of the unknown. When someone disappears without a trace, our imaginations will eventually concoct the worst possible explanation. And without knowing exactly how it happened, we have to accept the possibility that it could happen to us as well, and there is no way to stop it. So if your government is capable of this, then you have every reason to follow the rules and stay in line. You never know when you might be next. Which brings me to the second fear. It preys upon our fear of other people. There are plenty of phobias that humans are capable of, but nothing is more terrifying than what your fellow humans might do to you when nothing can stop them. Snakes can bite you, bears can eat you, and water can drown you, but only your fellow humans are capable of torturing you, and only your fellow humans know what will hurt you the most. Combine that with the fear of the unknown, and you now have the most effective method of terror and control.

But there's also a third factor that makes this tactic so effective. Most people don't know it, because only those who have been "disappeared" know the awful truth. For a better explanation, I'd like cite one of the most underrated historians of our time, Dan Carlin.
If you're a history buff and you've never heard of him, you don't know what you're missing. He doesn't just know what he's talking about, he knows how to relate history to our lives in the present. In this short video, he explains why the Nazis and Soviets were able to convince millions of people to enslave and murder their countrymen. When we think of the Nazis, we often believe their control was fostered by their propaganda efforts, but that was only one small piece of the puzzle.
In reality, their grip on the population was built upon their ability to make people disappear...
Keep that in mind when you read about Homan Square.
If that place is an isolated incident, there may still be time to stop these secret facilities before they usher in a new age of terror. But if there are already dozens of these "Homan Squares" out there that we don't know about, and they're just getting warmed up, we may have passed the point of no return...
If we ever become a country where everyone is afraid of disappearing for the slightest reason, then we are on the fast track to the kind of goose stepping tyranny that we've only read about...
While US military and intelligence interrogation impacted people overseas, Homan Square - said to house military-style vehicles and even a cage - focuses on American citizens, most often poor, black and brown.
