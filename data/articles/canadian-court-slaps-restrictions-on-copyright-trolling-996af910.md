# Canadian Court Slaps Restrictions on Copyright Trolling

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_internet179.htm

When a copyright holder says that people
have infringed their rights online, delicate issues hang in the balance.
Should courts absolutely protect the privacy
of alleged infringers and help them stay anonymous, or do the legitimate
rights of entertainment companies need to come first.
These are just some of the questions just
answered by the Federal Court in Ontario that will shape future
'trolling' cases in Canada.
Do individuals using BitTorrent to download
copyright material from the Internet via their ISP have a right to
remain anonymous so that they remain out of reach to rights-holders? If
so, what remedy will rights-holders have to prevent such infringement?
These questions and more have been under
consideration in the Federal Court in Toronto as part of a case
involving US-based movie studio and known copyright troll Voltage
Pictures ("The Hurt Locker") versus 2,000 currently anonymous Internet
subscribers of local ISP TekSavvy.
Voltage say that via local anti-piracy
company Canipre they tracked the
Teksavvy
customers downloading and sharing their movies online without permission
and as a result want Teksavvy to hand over the alleged pirates names and
addresses.
CIPPIC - protecting subscribers
The case has been dragging on for some time
with third parties such as the Canadian Internet Policy and Public
Interest Clinic (CIPPIC)
getting involved in order to protect the subscribers' rights.
CIPPIC
believes Voltage are nothing more than "copyright trolls" sending
settlement letters to alleged pirates in order to extract hard cash from
them.
Voltage's previous actions in this area are
well-known, with court documents showing that the movie company has
filed 22 similar lawsuits in the United States, each with the same
pattern.
Various flaws exist in the company's modus operandi, CIPPIC
say, not least that an IP address in isolation does not identify an
individual.
CIPPIC adds that Teksavvy shouldn't hand
anything over to Voltage, as this will,
"infringe the privacy rights of
the subscribers and may affect the scope of protection offered to
anonymous online activity."
CIPPIC fears that any ruling in this case
could have a detrimental effect on whistle-blowers and others who leak
documents in the public interest.
Voltage's stance
For their part, Voltage believe that since
they have a case under the Copyright Act, Teksavvy should be ordered to
hand over the subscribers' personal details.
Relying on a ruling in BMG Canada Inc. v
Doe, 2005, Voltage says it has met all conditions therein (such as
having a bona fide case, being reliant on the court/Teksavvy for
information to proceed, and promising to reimburse Teksavvy for costs
incurred), while adding that it,
"fully intends to pursue claims against
the subscribers."
The balancing act
So, should the court issue an order which
compels Teksavvy to hand over the information to Voltage and, if so,
what kind of protections could be baked into the order to minimize
invasion of privacy for the Internet users involved?
"Privacy considerations should not be a
shield for wrongdoing and must yield to an injured party's request for
information from non-parties. This should be the case irrespective of
the type of right the claimant holds," the Court writes in its ruling.
"Copyright is a valuable asset which should
not be easily defeated by infringers. The difficulty in this case is
that it is not clear that the protection of copyright is the sole
motivating factor supporting Voltage's claim in this Court.
[Evidence]
suggests but does not prove that Voltage may have ulterior motives in
commencing this action and may be a copyright troll."
Despite its concerns, the Court notes that
Voltage has established a bona fide claim and as a copyright holder its
rights outweigh the privacy rights of alleged infringers.
However, it
also notes that it would be taking steps to,
"ensure that privacy rights
are invaded in the most minimal way possible."
Privacy concerns and the trolling
threat
For its part, Voltage previously argued that
the alleged infringers had already made their IP addresses public when
they joined BitTorrent swarms and therefore should not be able to remain
anonymous in legal action.
The court accepted that stance to a degree
but noted that the,
"specter raised of the copyright troll" and the "very
real specter of flooding the Court with an enormous number of cases
involving the subscribers, many of whom may have perfectly good defenses
to the alleged infringement" had to be considered.
Interestingly, the Court pointed out that
damage provisions are limited by the Copyright Act and may prove to be
"minuscule" when compared to the cost, time and effort expended when
pursuing any claim against an alleged infringer.
Here, the Court seems
to have an eye on whether this exercise can be a profitable one for
Voltage, and whether it should or not.
Also of interest is the Court's examination
of other trolling' cases in the United States and UK, particularly
those involving ACS:Law and adult movie company GoldenEye.
Alongside
privacy issues, the Court looked at how the involvement of a consumer
group in the latter case had influenced the letters of claim eventually
sent out by GoldenEye.
Conclusion - Voltage get the green
light, but must proceed with caution
The Federal Court notes that evidence exists
to show that Voltage is a troll-like operation but the evidence was not
compelling enough to put the brakes on the exercise.
Voltage has a right
to the subscriber information held by Teksavvy following the issue of a
relevant order, the Court said.
However, in line with recent cases in the
UK, the Federal Court says it intends to maintain control over the
process by appointing a Case Management Judge to monitor,
"the conduct of
Voltage in its dealings with the alleged infringers."
Furthermore, the settlement letters sent out
by Voltage will have to be approved by the Court and CIPPIC, and must
include a copy of the court order and a clear statement that no court
has yet found any recipient liable for infringement or liable to pay
damages.
This addresses concerns from past cases in the UK where letters
implied that a court had already found guilt.
Other restrictions involve Teksavvy, who
must be fully reimbursed for their costs incurred when handing over
information, which will be restricted to names and addresses only.
This
data may not be handed to any other entity, including to the public or
media.
Significant restrictions to protect
subscribers
Describing the above safeguards as
"significant", Canadian lawyer Michael Geist says that the restrictions
could affect the financial viability of troll-type activity.
"Given the cap on liability and the
increased legal costs the court involvement will create (not to mention
paying legal fees for the ISP), it calls into question whether copyright
trolling litigation is economically viable in Canada.
The federal court
was clearly anxious to discourage such tactics and its safeguards
certainly make such actions less likely," Geist
concludes.
