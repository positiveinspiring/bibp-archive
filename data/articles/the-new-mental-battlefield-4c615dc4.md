THE NEW MENTAL BATTLEFIELD
from MindControlForums Website
In the December, 1980, edition of the US Army Journal, Military Review, an article by Lt Col. John B. Alexander entitled, "The New Mental Battlefield: Beam Me Up Spock", provided further insight into the technical capabilities now at the disposal of the controllers.
He writes,
"Several examples will demonstrate areas in which progress has been made The transference of energy from one organism to another The ability to heal or cause disease can be transmitted over a distance, thus inducing illness or death for no apparent cause Telepathic behaviour modification, which includes the ability to induce hypnotic states up to distances in excess of 1,000 kilometers, has been reported. The use of telepathic hypnosis also holds great potential. This capability could allow agents to be deeply planted with no conscious knowledge of their programming. In movie terms, the Manchurian Candidate lives and does not even require a phone call. Other mind-to-mind thought induction techniques are being considered. If perfected, this capability could allow the direct transference of thought via telepathy from one mind, or group of minds, to a selected target audience. The unique factor is that the recipient will not be aware that thoughts have been implanted from an external source. He or she will believe that thoughts are original."

If it is possible to feed 'artificial thoughts' into the morphogenetic field via satellite, then mind control of the entire planet is possible.
An individual's only resistance would be to constantly question the motivation behind their thoughts, and not act upon thoughts that they consider to be outside the boundaries of their own 'ethical and moral' boundaries.
Once again, it is wise to consider how television, advertising, and various forms of social pressure are constantly being used to manipulate those boundaries.
