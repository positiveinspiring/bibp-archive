Billionaires Dumping Stocks, Economist
Knows Why

Despite the 6.5%
stock market rally over
the last three months, a handful of billionaires are quietly dumping their
American stocks... and fast.
Warren Buffett, who has been a cheerleader for
U.S. stocks for quite some time, is dumping shares at an alarming rate. He
recently complained of disappointing performance in dyed-in-the-wool
American companies like Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and Kraft
Foods.
In the latest
filing for Buffetts holding company Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has been
drastically reducing his exposure to stocks that depend on consumer
purchasing habits. Berkshire sold roughly 19 million shares of Johnson &
Johnson, and reduced his overall stake in consumer product stocks by 21%.
Berkshire Hathaway also sold its entire stake in California-based computer
parts supplier Intel.
With 70% of the U.S. economy dependent on
consumer spending, Buffetts apparent lack of faith in these companies
future prospects is worrisome.
Unfortunately Buffett isnt alone.
Fellow
billionaire John Paulson,
who made a fortune betting on the subprime mortgage meltdown, is clearing
out of U.S. stocks too. During the second quarter of the year, Paulsons
hedge fund, Paulson & Co., dumped 14 million shares of JPMorgan Chase.
The fund also dumped its entire position in
discount retailer Family Dollar and consumer-goods maker Sara Lee.
No investors, let
alone billionaires, will want to own stocks with falling profit margins and
shrinking dividends.
So if thats why,
...are
dumping stocks, they have decided to cash out early and leave Main Street
investors holding the bag.
...is selling
roughly 42 percent of his stake in the Internet search
Google Inc. chairman Eric Schmidt plans to
sell up to $2.51 billion of his share in the company, according to a
Securities and Exchange Commission
filing late Friday.
Venezuela
devalued its currency, the Bolivar, the
countrys Finance Minister Jorge Giordani said Friday. President
Hugo Chavez ordered the move from Cuba, the minister said.
Could these be the signs of the upcoming market
collapse people have been talking about? I dont know, but things could
start to get interesting.
An ominous contemporary warning

Something
happened this week that brings back haunting memories of the 2001 put
options of airline stocks, except this bet is against the entire U.S.
economy.
This week, an
anonymous trader bought 100,000 put options on
the ETF, which is an acronym
for an exchange-traded fund. One commonly traded ETF is
XLF, which, in the
most unscientific and basic terms, is a group of funds that is like a
barometer for the stock market.
Anyone believe JPMs October 12th earnings
report which beat expectations? Looks like accounting BS engineered to
dump legacy positions on the general public.
A chorus of high-level executives inside
JPMorgan (JPM) are selling down their stakes in the company, in what
some experts are citing as unusual activity within the nations
largest bank by deposits.
CNBC reports that JPM execs have dumped $6
million in the past 10 days!
Currency War Fears Threaten Fragile
Global Economic Recovery
Source
The world
economy faces a new threat. Instead of a banking collapse or too much
debt, fears are growing that countries are using their currencies as an
economic weapon.
History
suggests thats never a good thing.
If too many
countries try to weaken their currencies for economic gain - sparking a
so-called currency war - then the fragile global economic recovery
could be derailed and the international financial system thrown into
chaos.
Jim
Rickards, Pentagon advisor, investment banker and author of the famous
book, Currency Wars, speaks with Jim Puplava on the Financial Sense Newshour to discuss the new age of global financial warfare and its
potential outcome on savers and investors around the world:
World Plunges Into Recession
Source
With
the disappointing initial GDP releases for 4Q-2012 from Europe out, the
world as defined by 41
OECD countries across the globe, has plunged
into recession.
We define recession through two
alternative definitions for our comparison, either the presence of a
single negative quarter-on-quarter growth or the more traditional two
consecutive negative quarterly growths.
Whichever way you look at it, the number of
countries in expansion plunged dramatically between 3Q-2013 and 4Q-2012.
Now this is a diffusion index, with each
country receiving equal weightings, and so it appears that 60% seems to
be a viable threshold for the definition of global recession using the
single-quarter definition (black) and 70% is probably the appropriate
threshold for the 2-quarter definition (blue).
