Today, the means of pushing the New Age
one-world religion is the environmental movement of the UN. The more
deceptive aim of the Environmental movement, however, is its use to further
the eugenics agenda, by arguing for limits to growth, and creating the
backwardness that serves British Imperialism.
The Aspen Institute, together
with the
United Nations, the
Club of Rome, the
Tavistock, and other such
organizations originating from the
Round Table, began propagandizing around
the issue of nuclear energy.[1]
Because, the proliferation of nuclear energy
as an alternative posed a threat to the oil interests that were dominated by
the Rockefellers and the Saudis, though claiming that the environment was
being destroyed, and therefore arguing against industrialization and for
limits to growth.
The American oilman, Robert O. Anderson, was a central figure in this
agenda. Anderson and his Atlantic Richfield Oil Co. funneled millions of
dollars, through their Atlantic Richfield Foundation, into select
organizations to confront nuclear energy. Robert O. Andersons major vehicle
to spread the new limits to growth ideology among American and European
establishment circles, was his Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies.
The
Aspen Institute was founded in 1949, by Aldous Huxley, and John Maynard
Hutchins, in commemoration of the 200th birthday of German philosopher and
author of Faust, and a member of
the Illuminati, Goethe.
Robert O. Anderson
Robert O. Anderson also contributed significant funds to a project initiated
by the Rockefeller family, together with Aurelio Peccei and Alexander King,
at the Rockefellers estate at Bellagio, Italy, called the Club of Rome.
In
1972, this Club of Rome, and the US Association of the Club of Rome, gave
widespread publicity to their publication of the notorious Limits to
Growth. Supported by research done at MIT, this report concluded that
industrialization had to be halted to save the planet from ecological
catastrophe.
These organizations were exploiting the panic induced, when Paul Ehrlich, a
biologist at Stanford, and admirer of Bertrand Russell, in 1968, wrote his
Malthusian projections in a best-selling book called
The Population Bomb.
In
it, Ehrlich suggested,
a cancer is an uncontrolled multiplication
of cells; the population explosion is an uncontrolled multiplication of
people... We must shift our efforts from the treatment of the symptoms
to the cutting out of the cancer. The operation will demand many
apparently brutal and heartless decisions.[2]
Ehrlich also advocated placing birth control
chemicals into the worlds food supplies.
The chief individual in this agenda is director of the Aspen Institute,
Canadian multi-millionaire
Maurice Strong. Strong is being heralded as the
indispensable man at the center of the U.N.s global power. He has served
as director of the World Future Society, trustee of the Rockefeller
Foundation and Aspen Institute, and is a member of the Club of Rome.
Strong
is now:
-
Senior Advisor to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan
-
Senior Advisor to
World Bank President James Wolfensohn
-
Chairman of the Earth Council
-
Chairman of the World Resources Institute
-
Co-Chairman of the Council of the
World Economic Forum
-
member of Toyotas International Advisory Board
Maurice Strong
However, also now heads the
Golden Dawn, and operates an international drug
ring and is also a top operative for British Intelligence.[3] He was a
founding member of both the Planetary Citizens.
Strong and other luminaries,
like,
...are listed as original endorsers of Planetary Citizens.
Founded
by Donald Keys, a disciple of
Alice Bailey and former UN consultant, and
presided over for many years by the late Norman Cousins (CFR), the
Planetary
Citizens organization supports the expansion of UN power and institutions.
In Earth At Omega, Keys maintains,
We have meditations at the United Nations a couple of times a week.
The
meditation leader is Sri Chinmoy, and this is what he said about this
situation:
The United Nations is the chosen instrument of
God; to be a
chosen instrument means to be a divine messenger carrying the banner of
Gods inner vision and outer manifestation. One day the world will...
treasure and cherish the soul of the United Nations as its very own with
enormous pride, for this soul is all-loving, all-nourishing, and
all-fulfilling.[4]
Cathedral of St. John the Divine
Maurice Strong also sits on the board of directors, and serves as director
of finance, for the Lindisfarne Center. Lindisfarne was founded by New Age
philosopher William Irwin Thompson, a former professor of humanities from
MIT and Syracuse University.
Thompson said:
"We have now a new spirituality, what has been called the New Age movement.
The planetization of the esoteric has been going on for some time... This is
now beginning to influence concepts of politics and community in ecology...
This is the Gaia [Mother Earth] politique... planetary culture.
Thompson
further stated that, the age of the independent sovereign state, with the
sovereign individual in his private property, [is] over, just as the
Christian fundamentalist days are about to be over.[5]
David Spangler
The Lindisfarne Center is located in Manhattans historic
Episcopal
Cathedral of St. John the Divine, dedicated to St. John, traditionally
revered by Freemasons of the Johannite creed.
Maurice Strong is the Finance
Director. The center is supported by the Lilly Endowment, the Rockefeller
Brothers Fund, and the Rockefeller Foundation, and lists among its faculty
members Amory Lovins, Gaia theory biologist
James Lovelock, and Luciferian
adept and New Age author David Spangler.
According to Spangler, in
Reflections on the Christ:
Lucifer, like Christ, stands at the door of mans consciousness and knocks.
If man says, Go away because I do not like what you represent, I am afraid
of you, Lucifer will play tricks on that fellow.
If man says, Come in, and
I will give to you the treat of my love and understanding and I will uplift
you in the light and presence of the Christ, my outflow, then Lucifer
becomes something else again. He becomes the being who carries that great
treat, the ultimate treat, the light of wisdom....[6]
James Lovelock
Located at the same Cathedral of St. John the Divine that houses the
Lindisfarne Luciferians is the Temple of Understanding. It was founded by
Lucis Trust, and is the controlling authority for
World Goodwill of Alice
Bailey.
Launched in the early 1960s as the spiritual counterpart of the
United Nations, its founding sponsors included:
-
John D. Rockefeller IV
-
then-Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara
-
Planned Parenthood founder
Margaret Sanger
-
IBM president Thomas J. Watson
-
Socialist Party leader
Norman Thomas
-
Eleanor Roosevelt
-
Time-Life president James A. Linen
-
author
Christopher Isherwood
-
columnist Max Lerner
-
entertainer Jack Benny
The
Temple organization, which works closely with the UN Secretariat, the World
Council of Churches, and the World Conference on Religion and Peace,
promotes the Interfaith Movement with its centennial celebration of the
Worlds Parliament of Religions.
Maurice Strong is also a member of the
Bahai World Faith. With Haifa, in
Israel, as the site of its international headquarters, the Bahai movement
now exercises a strong presence in the United Nations and its One-World
Religion agenda. Its involvement in the UN dates back to its founding in
1945.
In 1948, the Bahai community was recognized as an international
non-governmental organization. In May 1970, they were granted consultative
status with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), and later with the
United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF).
The Bahai organization has a
working relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO), is associated
with the UN Environment Program, as well as many other religious,
environmental and social programs.
Baca, Colorado
In 1978, Strong bought the Colorado Land & Cattle Company, which owned
200,000 acres of San Luis Valley in Colorado, from Saudi arms dealer Adnan
Khashoggi.[7]
A mystic had informed Maurice and his wife Hanne, that the
ranch, which they call the Baca,
would become the center for a new
planetary order which would evolve from the economic collapse and
environmental catastrophes that would sweep the globe in the years to come.
The Strongs say they regard the Baca, which they also refer to as The
Valley Of the Refuge Of World Truths, as the paradigm for the entire
planet.
The first groups to join the Strongs in setting up operations at the desert
site were the Aspen Institute and the Lindisfarne Association. The Baca is
replete with monasteries, and Ashram, Vedic temple, Native American shamans,
Hindu temple, ziggurat, and subterranean Zen Buddhist center.
Shirley MacLaines astrologer told her to move to the Baca, and she did. She is
building a New Age study center there where people can take short week-long
courses on the occult.
Another of Strongs friends, Najeeb Halaby, a CFR
member, former chairman of Pan American, and father of the Queen of Jordan,
wife to Freemason King Hussein, has built an Islamic ziggurat at the Baca.
Apparently, the like of
Kissinger,
the Rockefeller, McNamara, and
the Rothschilds also make their pilgrimage to the Baca.[8]
Few areas in the US are as rife in paranormal activity as Baca. The modern
history of unexplained occurrences began in the 1950s when green fireballs
were reportedly seen by thousands, and even before that were rashes of
UFOs that sound like what the Natives called spirit lights.
So frequent
are such reports in the valley that a UFO watchtower was erected.
From
the fall of 1966 through the spring of 1970 there were hundreds of
unidentified flying object sightings and many of the first documented cases
of unusual animal deaths ever reported, notes Christopher Obrien, in
The
Mysterious Valley, a website dedicated to a study of the strange occurrences
and sightings in the region.
During peak UFO sighting waves in the late
1960s dozens of cars would literally line the roads watching the amazing
aerial displays of unknown lights as they cavorted around the sky above the
Great Sand Dunes/Dry Lakes area. [9]
An interview, titled The Wizard Of the Baca Grande, which Maurice Strong
conducted with West magazine of Alberta, Canada, in May 1990, he provides
details which elucidate the reasons behind the Illuminatis support of the
environmental movement.
Strong concluded with a disturbing apocalyptic
scenario he would to include in a novel he says he would like to write:
Each year the World Economic Forum convenes in Davos, Switzerland. Over a
thousand CEOs, prime ministers, finance ministers, and leading academics
gather in February to attend meetings and set the economic agendas for the
year ahead.
What if a small group of these word leaders were to conclude that the
principle risk to the earth comes from the actions of the rich countries?
And if the world is to survive, those rich countries would have to sign an
agreement reducing their impact on the environment. Will they do it? Will
the rich countries agree to reduce their impact on the environment? Will
they agree to save the earth?
The groups conclusion is no. The rich countries wont do it. They wont
change. So, in order to save the planet, the group decides: isnt the only
hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isnt it
our responsibility to bring that about?
This group of world leaders form a secret society to bring about a world
collapse. Its February. Theyre all at Davos. These arent terrorists
theyre world leaders. They have positioned themselves in the worlds
commodity and stock markets. Theyve engineered, using their access to stock
exchanges, and computers, and gold supplies,
a panic.
Then they prevent the
markets from closing. They jam the gears. They have mercenaries who hold the
rest of the world leaders at Davros as hostage. The markets cant close. The
rich countries...? and Strong makes a slight motion with his fingers as if
he were flicking a cigarette butt out of the window.[10]
The Earth Summit
One of the more important achievements of the Aspen Institute was a
conference on Technology: Social Goals and Cultural Options, held in 1970,
that paved the way for the UNs Earth Summit in Stockholm in 1972, chaired
by Aspen board member, Maurice Strong.
As remarked Engdahl, the Stockholm
conference created the necessary international organizational and publicity
infrastructure, so that by the time of the Kissinger orchestrated oil
crisis, an intensive anti-nuclear propaganda offensive could be launched,
aided through the millions of dollars made available from oil-linked
channels of the Atlantic Richfield Company, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund
and
other such elites.
UNCED - Summit Rothschilds
March 12, 2006
UNCED
- Summit Rothschilds,
is a video
exposing the New World Order globalist plans for humanity on Earth.
Among the groups that were funded were organizations
including the World Wildlife Fund, then chaired by
Prince Bernard, and later
by Royal Dutch Shells John Loudon.
As Engdahl noted:
It is indicative of this financial establishments overwhelming influence in
the American and British media that, during this period, no public outcry
was launched to investigate the probable conflict of interest involved in
Robert O. Andersons well-financed anti-nuclear offensive, and the fact that
his Atlantic Richfield Oil Co. was one of the major beneficiaries from the
1974 price increase for oil.
Andersons ARCO had invested tens of millions
of dollars in high-risk oil infrastructure in Alaskas Prudhoe Bay and
Britains North Sea, together with Exxon, British Petroleum, Shell and the
other Seven Sisters.[11]
Earth Summit 1992
Strong was Secretary-General of the UN Conference on Environment and
Development (UNCED), held at the June 1992 UN Earth Summit in Brazil.
It was
hoped that an Earth Charter would be the result of the Earth Summit, but it
was not the case. Nevertheless, an international agreement was adopted,
named
Agenda 21, which laid down the international sustainable development
necessary to form a future Earth Charter agreement.
Maurice Strong hinted at
the overtly pagan agenda proposed for a future Earth Charter, when in his
opening address to the Rio Conference delegates he said,
It is the
responsibility of each human being today to choose between the force of
darkness and the force of light.
And, he said,
We must therefore transform
our attitudes and adopt a renewed respect for the superior laws of divine
nature.
According to Strong,
The real goal of the Earth Charter is that it
will in fact become like the Ten Commandments. [12]
The summit was described by Time magazine as a New Age carnival.
On the
eve of the UNCED, a midnight-to-dawn homage to the Female Planet was held
on Leme Beach. After dancing all night, the worshipers followed a Brazilian
high priestess to the waters edge, where they offered flowers and fruits to
the Voodoo mother goddess, Iemanje, mae orixa, mother of the powers, queen
of the seas, known in Western mythology as Aphrodite or Venus, and then
invoked the blessings of the sea goddess upon the summits deliberations.
At
the culmination of the program, a group calling itself the Sacred Drums of
the Earth, performed a ceremony by which they would,
maintain a continuous
heartbeat near the official site of the Earth Summit, as part of a ritual
for the healing of our Earth to be felt by those who are deciding Earths
fate. [13]
Thus, the environmental movement, while helping to advance the cause of the
oil industry, is an extension of the Aquarian conspiracy, incepted by
Alice
Bailey, designed ultimately to foster the acceptance a one-world-religion,
based on the occult, or the New Age, as it is called.
The Union for Natural
Environment Protection, an environmental group based in Sao Leopoldo,
Brazil, declared the following about the work of the summit:
Al Gore
A world-wide citizens movement is born around the UN system and will be in
the years ahead a central focal point for the
New World Order which
Alice
Bailey wrote about many decades ago and which is going to be politically
free, socially fair, economically efficient and environmentally
sustainable.[14]
The environmental movement is being used as a cover to promote return to the
creed of the Ancient Mysteries, in the form of the worship of mother-nature,
a pagan notion that equates the goddess with earth, known among the ancient
Greeks as Gaia.
Originally, she is the
Babylonian Ishtar, known to the Bible
as Astarte, or the Egyptian Isis. This pantheistic idea has its origins in
ancient paganism, and is central to the Kabbalah and all Western occult
tradition, including Freemasons and the Illuminati.
Plato wrote:
We shall
affirm that the cosmos, more than anything else, resembles most closely that
living Creature of which all other living creatures, severally or
genetically, are portion; a living creature which is fairest of all and in
ways most perfect. [15]
Known as Anima Mundi, the Soul of the World, it is
related to the concept of the Neoplatonists, the Logos, or the Word, also
known as the Son of God, or the ancient dying-god.
