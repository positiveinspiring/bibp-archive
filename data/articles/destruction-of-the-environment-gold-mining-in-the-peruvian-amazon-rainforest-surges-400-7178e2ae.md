The extent of gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon
has surged 400 percent since 1999 due to rocketing gold prices, wreaking
havoc on forests and devastating local rivers, finds a new study (Elevated
Rates of Gold Mining in the Amazon Revealed through High-Resolution
Monitoring) published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
The assessment, led by Greg Asner of the
Carnegie Institution for Science, is based on a combination of satellite
imagery, on-the-ground field surveys, and an
advanced airplane-based sensor that can accurately measure the
rainforest canopy and sub-canopy vegetation at a resolution of 1.1 meters
(42 inches).
The approach enabled the researchers to detect
changes in forest cover in areas as small as 10 square meters, roughly 100
square feet, allowing them to map thousands of small, clandestine mines that
had never before been detected at scale.

The results are sobering: the extent of gold
mines in the Madre de Dios region of Peru increased from less than 10,000
hectares in 1999 to more than 50,000 ha as of September 2012.
The rate of expansion jumped from 5,350 acres
(2,166 ha) per year before 2008 to 15,180 acres (6,145 ha) per year
thereafter. Surging gold prices, combined with increased access to the
region granted by new roads, are thought to be driving the spike in mining
activity.
"Our results reveal far more rainforest
damage than previously reported by the government, NGOs, or other
researchers," said Asner, noting that small informal mines account for
more than half of mining in the region.

occurrence of small and large mines
throughout the southern Madre
de Dios region.
The findings are significant because
environmental damage from mining extends far beyond forest loss - mining
destroys rivers, exacerbates hunting, and sends toxic waste downstream
toward villages and towns.
Other studies have found high
mercury levels in fish and human populations in and around Puerto
Maldonado, a major city down-river from several major mining sites. Other
research suggests that the effects of mining could last decades: a paper,
also published today in PNAS, shows that mercury from the mid-19th
century Gold Rush in California continues to contaminate agricultural areas
in the state's rich central valley.
The long-term ramifications for the Peruvian
Amazon, which has some of the highest levels of biodiversity ever recorded,
are still largely unknown.
"The gold rush in Madre de Dios, Perú,
exceeds the combined effects of all other causes of forest loss in the
region, including from logging, ranching and agriculture," said Asner.
"This is really important because we're
talking about a global biodiversity hotspot. The region's incredible
flora and fauna is being lost to gold fever."

Asner's paper, which is co-authored with
researchers from Carnegie and Peru's Ministry of Environment, comes as
tensions over illegal gold mining in Peru are rising.
In late September several associations of
informal gold miners launched a "strike" in Madre de Dios, blocking roads,
threatening to attack a water processing plant, and assaulting a small
farming town along the
Interoceanic Highway.
The Ministry of Environment had to deploy
security forces to protect its offices in Lima and Puerto Maldonado.
Undeterred, study co-author Ernesto Raez Luna,
a senior advisor to Peru's Minister of Environment, says the research will
enable to government to take action against illegal mining.
"Obtaining good information on illegal gold
mining, to guide sound policy and enforcement decisions, has been
particularly difficult so far. Finally, we have very detailed and
accurate data that we can turn into government action.
We are using this study to warn Peruvians on
the terrible impact of illegal mining in one of the most important
enclaves of biodiversity in the world, a place that we have vowed, as a
nation, to protect for all humanity. Nobody should buy one gram of this
jungle gold.
The mining must be stopped."

Informal gold mining isn't limited to
Madre de Dios or even the Peruvian Amazon.
High gold prices have spurred illicit mining in
rainforests around the world, including,
