Bukovsky and Belien
Vladimir Bukovsky, the 63-year old former Soviet
dissident, fears that the European Union is on its way to becoming another
Soviet Union.
In a speech he delivered in Brussels last week Mr Bukovsky
called the EU a monster that must be destroyed, the sooner the better,
before it develops into a full-fledged totalitarian state.
Mr Bukovsky paid a visit to the European Parliament on Thursday (February
2006) at the
invitation of
Fidesz, the Hungarian Civic Forum.
Fidesz, a member of the
European Christian Democrat group, had invited the former Soviet dissident
over from England, where he lives, on the occasion of this years 50th
anniversary of the
1956 Hungarian Uprising.
After his morning meeting with
the Hungarians, Mr Bukovsky gave an afternoon speech in a Polish restaurant
in the Trier straat, opposite the European Parliament, where he spoke at the
invitation of
the United Kingdom Independence Party, of which he is a
patron.
An interview with Vladimir Bukovsky about the impending EUSSR
In his speech Mr Bukovsky referred to confidential documents from secret
Soviet files which he was allowed to read in 1992.
These documents confirm
the existence of a conspiracy to turn the European Union into a socialist
organization. I attended the meeting and taped the speech. A transcript, as
well as the audio fragment (approx. 15 minutes) can be found below.
I also
had a brief interview with Mr Bukovsky (4 minutes), a transcript and audio
fragment of which can also be found below. The interview about the European
Union had to be cut short because Mr Bukovsky had other engagements, but it
brought back some memories to me, as I had interviewed Vladimir Bukovsky
twenty years ago, in 1986, when the Soviet Union, the first monster that he
so valiantly fought, was still alive and thriving.
Mr Bukovsky was one of the heroes of the 20th century. As a young man he
exposed the use of psychiatric imprisonment against political prisoners in
the former USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 1917-1991) and spent a
total of twelve years (1964-1976), from his 22nd to his 34th year, in Soviet
jails, labour camps and psychiatric institutions.
In 1976 the Soviets
expelled him to the West. In 1992 he was invited by the Russian government
to serve as an expert testifying at the trial conducted to determine whether
the Soviet Communist Party had been a criminal institution. To prepare for
his testimony Mr Bukovsky was granted access to a large number of documents
from Soviet secret archives.
He is one of the few people ever to have seen
these documents because they are still classified.
Using a small handheld
scanner and a laptop computer, however, he managed to copy many documents
(some with high security clearance), including KGB reports to the Soviet
government.
An interview with
Vladimir Bukovsky
Paul Belien: You were a very famous Soviet
dissident and now you are drawing a parallel between the European Union
and the Soviet Union. Can you explain this?
Vladimir Bukovsky: I am referring to structures, to certain ideologies
being instilled, to the plans, the direction, the inevitable expansion,
the obliteration of nations, which was the purpose of the Soviet Union.
Most people do not understand this.
They do not know it, but we do
because we were raised in the Soviet Union where we had to study the
Soviet ideology in school and at university. The ultimate purpose of the
Soviet Union was to create a new historic entity, the Soviet people, all
around the globe. The same is true in the EU today. They are trying to
create a new people. They call this people Europeans, whatever that
means.
According to Communist doctrine as well as to many forms of Socialist
thinking, the state, the national state, is supposed to wither away. In
Russia, however, the opposite happened. Instead of withering away the
Soviet state became a very powerful state, but the nationalities were
obliterated.
But when the time of the Soviet collapse came these
suppressed feelings of national identity came bouncing back and they
nearly destroyed the country. It was so frightening.
PB: Do you think the same thing can happen when the European Union
collapses?
VB: Absolutely, you can press a spring only that much, and the human
psyche is very resilient you know. You can press it, you can press it,
but dont forget it is still accumulating a power to rebound. It is like
a spring and it always goes to overshoot.
PB: But all these countries that joined the European Union did so
voluntarily.
VB: No, they did not. Look at Denmark which voted against the Maastricht
treaty twice. Look at Ireland [which voted against the Nice treaty].
Look at many other countries, they are under enormous pressure. It is
almost blackmail. Switzerland was forced to vote five times in a
referendum. All five times they have rejected it, but who knows what
will happen the sixth time, the seventh time. It is always the same
thing. It is a trick for idiots.
The people have to vote in referendums
until the people vote the way that is wanted. Then they have to stop
voting. Why stop? Let us continue voting.
The European Union is what
Americans would call a shotgun marriage.
PB: What do you think young people should do about the European Union?
What should they insist on, to democratize the institution or just
abolish it?
VB: I think that the European Union, like the Soviet Union, cannot be
democratized. Gorbachev tried to democratize it and it blew up. This
kind of structures cannot be democratized.
PB: But we have a European Parliament which is chosen by the people.
VB: The European Parliament is elected on the basis of proportional
representation, which is not true representation.
And what does it vote
on? The percentage of fat in yoghurt, that kind of thing. It is
ridiculous. It is given the task of the Supreme Soviet. The average MP
can speak for six minutes per year in the Chamber.
That is not a real
parliament.
Transcript of Mr Bukovskys
Brussels speech
In 1992 I had unprecedented access to
Politburo and
Central Committee secret
documents which have been classified, and still are even now, for 30 years.
These documents show very clearly that the whole idea of turning the
European
common market into a federal state was agreed between the left-wing
parties of Europe and Moscow as a joint project which [Soviet leader
Mikhail] Gorbachev in 1988-89 called our common European home.
The idea was very simple. It first came up in 1985-86, when the Italian
Communists visited Gorbachev, followed by the German Social-Democrats.
They
all complained that the changes in the world, particularly after [British
Prime Minister Margaret] Thatcher introduced privatization and economic
liberalization, were threatening to wipe out the achievement (as they called
it) of generations of Socialists and Social-Democrats - threatening to
reverse it completely.
Therefore the only way to withstand this onslaught of
wild capitalism (as they called it) was to try to introduce the same
socialist goals in all countries at once.
Prior to that, the left-wing
parties and the Soviet Union had opposed European integration very much
because they perceived it as a means to block their socialist goals. From
1985 onwards they completely changed their view. The Soviets came to a
conclusion and to an agreement with the left-wing parties that if they
worked together they could hijack the whole European project and turn it
upside down.
Instead of an open market they would turn it into a federal
state.
According to the [secret Soviet] documents, 1985-86 is the turning point. I
have
published most of these documents. You might even
find them on the
internet. But the conversations they had are really eye opening. For the
first time you understand that there is a conspiracy - quite understandable
for them, as they were trying to save their political hides.
In the East the
Soviets needed a change of relations with Europe because they were entering
a protracted and very deep structural crisis; in the West the left-wing
parties were afraid of being wiped out and losing their influence and
prestige.
So it was a conspiracy, quite openly made by them, agreed upon,
and worked out.
In January of 1989, for example, a delegation of
the Trilateral Commission
came to see Gorbachev.
It included,
-
[former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro]
Nakasone
-
[former French President Valéry] Giscard dEstaing
-
[American
banker David]
Rockefeller
-
[former US Secretary of State Henry]
Kissinger
They had a very nice conversation where they tried to explain to
Gorbachev that Soviet Russia had to integrate into the financial
institutions of the world, such as Gatt, the
IMF and the
World Bank.
In the middle of it Giscard dEstaing suddenly takes the floor and says:
Mr
President, I cannot tell you exactly when it will happen - probably within
15 years - but Europe is going to be a federal state and you have to prepare
yourself for that. You have to work out with us, and the European leaders,
how you would react to that, how would you allow the other Easteuropean
countries to interact with it or how to become a part of it, you have to be
prepared.
This was January 1989, at a time when the [1992] Maastricht treaty had not
even been drafted.
How the hell did Giscard dEstaing know what was going to
happen in 15 years time? And surprise, surprise, how did he become the
author of the European constitution [in 2002-03]? A very good question. It
does smell of conspiracy, doesnt it?
Luckily for us the Soviet part of this conspiracy collapsed earlier and it
did not reach the point where Moscow could influence the course of events.
But the original idea was to have what they called a convergency, whereby
the Soviet Union would mellow somewhat and become more social-democratic,
while Western Europe would become social-democratic and socialist. Then
there will be convergency.
The structures have to fit each other. This is
why the structures of the European Union were initially built with the
purpose of fitting into the Soviet structure. This is why they are so
similar in functioning and in structure.
It is no accident that the European Parliament, for example, reminds me of
the Supreme Soviet. It looks like the Supreme Soviet because it was designed
like it.
Similarly, when you look at the European Commission it looks like
the Politburo. I mean it does so exactly, except for the fact that the
Commission now has 25 members and the Politburo usually had 13 or 15
members. Apart from that they are exactly the same, unaccountable to anyone,
not directly elected by anyone at all. When you look into all this bizarre
activity of the European Union with its 80,000 pages of regulations it looks
like
Gosplan.
We used to have an organization which was planning everything
in the economy, to the last nut and bolt, five years in advance. Exactly the
same thing is happening in the EU. When you look at the type of EU
corruption, it is exactly the Soviet type of corruption, going from top to
bottom rather than going from bottom to top.
If you go through all the structures and features of this emerging European
monster you will notice that it more and more resembles the Soviet Union.
Of
course, it is a milder version of the Soviet Union. Please, do not
misunderstand me. I am not saying that it has a Gulag. It has no KGB - not
yet - but I am very carefully watching such structures as
Europol for
example.
That really worries me a lot because this
organization will
probably have powers bigger than those of the KGB. They will have diplomatic
immunity.
Can you imagine a KGB with diplomatic immunity? They will have to
police us on 32 kinds of crimes - two of which are particularly worrying,
No criminal court on earth defines anything like
this as a crime [this is not entirely true, as
Belgium already does so - pb].
So it is a new crime, and we have already
been warned. Someone from the British government told us that those who
object to uncontrolled immigration from the Third World will be regarded as
racist and those who oppose further European integration will be regarded as
xenophobes.
I think
Patricia Hewitt said this publicly.
Hence, we have now been warned. Meanwhile they are introducing more and more
ideology. The Soviet Union used to be a state run by ideology. Todays
ideology of the European Union is social-democratic, statist, and a big part
of it is also political correctness. I watch very carefully how political
correctness spreads and becomes an oppressive ideology, not to mention the
fact that they forbid smoking almost everywhere now.
Look at this
persecution of people like the Swedish pastor who was
persecuted for several
months because he said that the Bible does not approve homosexuality.
France
passed the same law of hate speech concerning gays. Britain is passing hate
speech laws concerning race relations and
now religious speech, and so on
and so forth. What you observe, taken into perspective, is a systematic
introduction of ideology which could later be enforced with oppressive
measures. Apparently that is the whole purpose of Europol.
Otherwise why do
we need it? To me Europol looks very suspicious. I watch very carefully who
is persecuted for what and what is happening, because that is one field in
which I am an expert.
I know how Gulags spring up.
It looks like we are living in a period of rapid, systematic and very
consistent dismantlement of democracy. Look at this
Legislative and
Regulatory Reform Bill. It makes ministers into legislators who can
introduce new laws
without bothering to tell Parliament or anyone.
My
immediate reaction is why do we need it?
Britain survived two world wars,
the war with Napoleon, the Spanish Armada, not to mention the Cold War, when
we were told at any moment we might have a nuclear world war, without any
need for introducing this kind legislation, without the need for suspending
our civil liberties and introducing emergency powers. Why do we need it
right now? This can make a dictatorship out of your country in no time.
Todays situation is really grim.
Major political parties have been
completely taken in by the new EU project. None of them really opposes it.
They have become very corrupt. Who is going to defend our freedoms? It looks
like we are heading towards some kind of collapse, some kind of crisis. The
most likely outcome is that there will be an economic collapse in Europe,
which in due time is bound to happen with this growth of expenses and taxes.
The inability to create a competitive environment, the overregulation of the
economy, the bureaucratization, it is going to lead to economic collapse.
Particularly the introduction of the euro was a crazy idea. Currency is not
supposed to be political.
I have no doubt about it. There will be a collapse of the European Union
pretty much like the Soviet Union collapsed. But do not forget that when
these things collapse they leave such devastation that it takes a generation
to recover. Just think what will happen if it comes to an economic crisis.
The recrimination between nations will be huge. It might come to blows. Look
to the huge number of immigrants from Third World countries now living in
Europe. This was promoted by the European Union.
What will happen with them
if there is
an economic collapse?
We will probably have, like in the Soviet
Union at the end, so much ethnic strife that the mind boggles. In no other
country were there such ethnic tensions as in the Soviet Union, except
probably in Yugoslavia.
So that is exactly what will happen here, too. We
have to be prepared for that.
This huge edifice of bureaucracy is going to
collapse on our heads.
This is why, and I am very frank about it, the sooner we finish with the EU
the better. The sooner it collapses the less damage it will have done to us
and to other countries. But we have to be quick because the Eurocrats are
moving very fast. It will be difficult to defeat them. Today it is still
simple.
If one million people march on Brussels today these guys will run
away to the Bahamas. If tomorrow half of the British population refuses to
pay its taxes, nothing will happen and no-one will go to jail. Today you can
still do that. But I do not know what the situation will be tomorrow with a
fully fledged Europol staffed by former
Stasi or
Securitate officers.
Anything may happen.
We are losing time. We have to defeat them.
We have to sit and think, work
out a strategy in the shortest possible way to achieve maximum effect.
Otherwise it will be too late. So what should I say? My conclusion is not
optimistic.
So far, despite the fact that we do have some anti-EU forces in
almost every country, it is not enough.
We are losing and we are wasting time.

Vladimir Bukovsky, un disidente de 63 años originario de la ex Unión
Soviética, exiliado en Gran Bretaña, teme que la Unión Europea esté en
camino de convertirse en otra Unión Soviética.
En un discurso que dio en
Bruselas la semana pasada (Febrero 2006), el Sr. Bukovsky, llamó a la UE un mostruo que
debe ser destruido, cuanto antes mejor, antes de que se convierta en un
estado totalitario por completo.
V. Bukovsky, junto a Paul Belien
Una entrevista con Vladimir Bukovsky sobre la programada EUSSR
En un discurso ofrecido por el Sr. Bukovsky, éste se refirió a documentos
confidenciales de archivos soviéticos secretos a los que se le permitió
tener acceso en 1922.
Estos documentos confirmaban la existencia de una
conspiración para convertir la Unión Europea en una organización
socialista. La transcripción de parte de la entrevista puede ser leída abajo.
El Sr. Bukovsky fue uno de los héroes del siglo XX. Cuando era joven,
denunció el papel del encerramiento psiquiátrico contra los prisioneros en la
ex URSS (Unión de Repúblicas Socialistas Soviéticas 1917-1991) y se pasó 12
años (1964-1976) de su juventud entre rejas en cárceles soviéticas, campos
de concentración e instituciones siquiátricas.
En 1976, los soviets le
expulsaron a Occidente.
En 1992 (tras la caída de la ex URSS) fue invitado por el gobierno ruso para
servir como un experto a la hora de testificar en el juicio llevado a cabo
en Rusia para determinar si el Partido Comunista Soviético había sido o no
una institución criminal. Para preparar su testimonio, el Sr Bukovsky tuvo
acceso a un gran número de documentos soviéticos procedentes de archivos
secretos.
Es una de las pocas personas que han visto estos documentos en
formato físico porque aun están clasificados.
Empleando un escáner manual y
un computador laptop, logró copiar muchos documentos (algunos con alto nivel
de top secret) incluyendo informes de la KGB al gobierno soviético.
Una entrevista con Vladimir Bukovsky
Paul Belien: Tú eres un disidente famoso de la Unión Soviética y ahora,
estás dibujando un paralelismo entre la Unión Soviética y la Unión Europea,
¿puedes explicar esto?
Vladimir Bukovsky: Me refiero a las estructuras, a ciertas estructuras, a
ciertas ideologías que instilan, a los planes, a la dirección que lleva, a
la inevitable expansión, la forma en que se deja de lado a las naciones, lo
cual fue el propósito de la URSS.
La mayor parte de la gente no entiende
esto.
No lo saben, pero nosotros sí, porque nosotros fuimos criados en la
Unión Soviética donde teníamos que estudiar la ideología soviética en la
escuela y en la universidad.
El objetivo final de la Unión Soviética era
crear una nueva entidad histórica, la gente soviética, repartida por todo
el globo. Lo mismo ocurre en la Unión Europea, hoy.
Están intentando crear
una nueva gente. Lo llaman europeos, lo que quiera que eso signifique.
De acuerdo a la doctrina comunista, como para muchas formas de pensamiento
socialista, el Estado, el estado nacional, va a desaparecer. En Rusia, sin
embargo, ocurrió lo contrario. El Estado soviético llegó a ser un estado muy
poderoso, pero las nacionalidades fueron dejadas de lado.
Cuando llegó el
momento en que colapsó la Unión Soviética, estos sentimientos reprimidos de
identidad nacional volvieron con fuerza y casi destruyeron el país. Fue un
momento terrorífico.
PB: ¿Piensas que puede ocurrir lo mismo cuando colapse la Unión Europea?
VB: Por supuesto. Puedes presionar algo hasta cierto punto y la
psiquis
humana es muy resistente. Pero se está acumulando con dicha presión un
potencial para rebrotar. Es como una primavera y siempre hay una explosión
de brotes.
PB: Pero todos estos países se unieron a La Unión Europa voluntariamente
VB: No, no lo hicieron. Dinamarca votó contra el tratado de Maastricht dos
veces. En Irlanda (que votó contra el tratado de Niza).
Otros países están
bajo una enorme presión. Es casi un chantaje. Suiza fue forzada a votar
cinco veces en un referéndum. Las cinco veces rechazaron el tratado, pero
nunca se sabe lo que ocurrirá la sexta o la séptima vez. Siempre es lo mismo.
Es como un truco para idiotas.
La gente tiene que votar en
referéndum hasta
que vote de la forma que ellos quieren. Entonces, pueden dejar de votar. ¿Por
qué lo dejan? Deberían continuar votando.
La Unión Europea es lo que los
americanos llamarían un matrimonio de penalti.
PB: ¿Qué crees que la gente joven tendría que hacer respecto a la Unión
Europea? ¿Democratizarla o abolirla?
VB: Creo que la Unión Europea, como la Unión Soviética, no puede ser
democratizada. Gorbachev intentó democratizarla y lo volaron. Este tipo de
estructuras no pueden ser democratizadas.
PB: Pero tenemos un Parlamento Europeo que está elegido por el pueblo.
VB: El Parlamento Europeo es elegido sobre la base de representación
promocional que no es verdadera representación.
¿Y sobre qué votan ellos? El
porcentaje de grasa en el yogurt, y ese tipo de cosas. Se le da la función
del Soviet Supremo. La media de ministros del parlamento, puede hablar
durante seis minutos por año en la Cámara.
Esto no es un parlamento real.
Transcripción del discurso del Sr. Bukovsky en Bruselas
(Traducción Parcial - Versión completa en
el original)
En 1992, tuve acceso sin precedentes a los documentos del
Politburó y el
Comité Central que habían sido clasificados y todavía siguen clasificados,
después de 30 años.
Estos documentos muestran muy claramente que toda la
idea de convertir el
mercado común Europeo en un estado federal fue acordado
entre partidos de izquierda de Europa y Moscú como un proyecto conjunto que
el líder Mijail Gorbachev en 1988-1989 llamaba nuestra casa Europea común -
common European home.
La idea fue muy simple. Llegó por primera vez en 1985-1986, cuando los
comunistas italianos visitaron a Gorvachov.
Después de los social-demócratas
alemanes. Todos ellos se quejaban de que los cambios en el mundo,
particularmente después de que la Thatcher introdujera la privatización y
liberización de la economía, estaban amenazando el logro (como lo llamaban)
de generaciones de socialistas y socialdemócratas y amenazando con revertir
los logros completamente.
Entonces, la única forma de mantener el
enfrentamiento con el capitalismo salvaje, (como lo llamaban) era introducir
los mismos objetivos socialistas en todos los países a la vez.

Entonces, la única forma de mantener el
enfrentamiento con el capitalismo salvaje, (como lo llamaban) era introducir
los mismos objetivos socialistas en todos los países a la vez.
No es casual que el Parlamento Europeo, por ejemplo, me recuerde tanto al
Soviet Supremo. Parece como el Soviet Supremo porque fue diseñado de ese
modo. De forma similar, cuando observas a la Comisión Europea, se parece al Polit Bureau, quiero decir que es eso exactamente, excepto por el detalle
de que la Comisión tiene 25 miembros y el Polit Bureau usualmente tenía 13 y
15 miembros.
Aparte de eso, son exactamente lo mismo, nadie les elige y no
dan cuentas ante nadie. Cuando miras a toda esta extraña actividad de la
Unión Europea con sus 80.000 páginas de regulaciones. Todo ello tiene el
mismo aspecto que
el Gosplan.
Solíamos tener una organización que planificaba exactamente todo en la
economía, hasta la última coma con una antelación de 5 años.
Exactamente lo
mismo ocurre en la UE. Cuando miras al tipo de corrupción en la UE, tienes
el mismo tipo de corrupción soviética, que va desde arriba abajo, en lugar
de ir de abajo arriba.
Si analizas bien los rasgos y estructuras del emergente monstruo Europeo, te
darás cuenta de que se parece más y más a la Unión Soviética. Por supuesto,
es una versión más ligera de la Unión Soviética. Por favor, no me
malinterpreten. No estoy diciendo que tenga un Gulag.
No hay KBG, no todavía,
pero estoy estudiando muy de cerca a estructuras tales como
el Europol.
Esto
es algo que preocupa mucho porque esta organización probablemente tiene
poderes superiores a los que tenía la KGB. Por ejemplo, tendrán inmunidad
diplomática.
¿Puedes imaginar una KGB con inmunidad diplomática?.
Tendrán derecho a acusarnos de 32 crímenes diferentes, dos de ellos
particularmente preocupantes,
-
uno se llama racismo
-
el otro xenofobia
No
hay juzgado en la Tierra que defina esto como un crimen (Nota Belien: no
es cierto porque Bélgica ya lo considera un crimen).
Así que es un nuevo
crimen y ya hemos sido alertados. Alguien en el gobierno británico nos dijo
que aquellos que objeten a una inmigración incontrolada del Tercer Mundo
serán mirados como racistas y aquellos que se opongan a la integración
europea en lo sucesivo serán mirados como xenófobos. Creo que Patricia
Hewitt lo dijo esto públicamente.
Así que hemos sido alertados. Mientras tanto ellos están introduciendo más y
más ideología. La Unión Soviética solía ser un estado dirigido por la
ideología. La ideología actual de Unión Europea es socialdemocracia y en
gran parte corrección política. Observo con atención cómo la corrección
política se extiende y se convierte en ideología opresiva, sin mencionar el
hecho de que prohíben fumar casi en cualquier sitio.
Mira cómo persiguen a
gente como el pastor sueco que fue juzgado durante meses porque había dicho
que la Biblia no aprueba la homosexualidad. Francia aprobó la misma ley
sobre discurso de odio y el discurso religioso, etc. etc. Cuando observas, si
lo tomas en perspectiva, es una introducción sistemática de ideología que
podría más tarde ser aplicada con medidas opresivas.
Aparentemente este es
el propósito final de la Europol.
De otro modo, ¿para qué lo necesitan?
Para
mi la Europol tiene un aspecto muy sospechoso. Estudio con mucha atención
quién es perseguido por ellos y qué ocurre. Porque es un campo en el que soy
experto. Se cómo florecen los Gulags.
Parece que estamos viviendo en un período de desmantelamiento de la
democracia muy consistente, sistemático y rápido. Mira la Reforma de la Ley
Legislativa y Regulatoria. Convierte a los ministros en legisladores que
pueden aprobar nuevas leyes sin que tengan que comunicarlo ni ser aprobado
por el Parlamento o nadie.
Mi reacción inmediata a eso es ¿Para qué necesitan esto? Gran Bretaña
sobrevivió a dos guerras mundiales, la guerra con Napoleón, la Armada
Española, sin mencionar la Guerra Fría cuando nos dijeron que en cualquier
momento podríamos tener una guerra mundial nuclear sin ninguna necesidad
para introducción este tipo de legislación, sin necesidad de suspender
nuestras libertades civiles e introducir poderes de emergencia.
¿Para qué lo
necesitan ahora mismo? Esto puede convertir una dictadura de tu país en poco
tiempo.
La situación actual es realmente triste. Los grandes partidos políticos han
sido completamente tomados por el nuevo proyecto de la UE. Ninguno de ellos
se opone. Han llegado a ser muy corruptos.
¿Quién va a defender nuestras
libertades? Parece que nos están llevando a algún tipo de colapso, alguna
suerte de crisis.
La consecuencia más probable es que haya un colapso
económico en Europa que, al debido tiempo, va a ir aparejado como
crecimiento de gastos e impuestos. La incapacidad de crear un ambiente
competitivo, la sobre-regulación de la economía, la burocratización, todo
ello va a llevar al colapso económico. Particularmente, la introducción del
euro fue un idea absurda.
La moneda no tiene por qué ser política.
No tengo duda de ello. Habrá un colapso de la Unión Europea, del mismo modo
que colapsó la Unión Soviética. Pero no olvidéis que cuando estas cosas
colapsan, arrastran tal devastación que se necesita una generación entera
para recuperarse. Simplemente pensad qué ocurrirá si llega una crisis
económica. La recriminación entre las naciones serán enorme.
Mira el gran
número de inmigrantes del Tercer Mundo que vive ya en Europa. Esto fue
promovido directamente por la Unión Europea.
¿Qué ocurrirá si llega un
colapso económico?
Probablemente tendremos, como en la URSS al final, tal
enfrentamiento étnico que será imposible soportarlo. En ningún país hubo tal
enfrentamiento étnico como en la Unión Soviética, excepto probablemente en
Yugoslavia. Eso es exactamente lo que ocurrirá aquí. Tenemos que estar
preparados para eso.
El enorme edificio de la burocracia va a colapsar encima
de nuestras cabezas.
Esta es la razón por la que soy muy franco al respecto, cuanto antes
terminemos con ello, mejor. Cuanto antes colapse, menor será el daño que nos
ocasionará a nosotros y otros países. Pero tenemos que ser rápidos porque
los eurócratas se están moviendo muy rápido. Será difícil de veras
vencerles. Hoy todavía parece simple. Si un millón de personas se levanta en
Bruselas, estos tipos saldrán corriendo a las Bahamas.
Si mañana la mitad de
la población británica rechaza pagarles impuestos, nada ocurrirá y nadie irá
a la cárcel. Hoy todavía podemos hacer esto. Pero no sé cuál será la
situación mañana con una Europol totalmente desplegada organizada por ex
oficiales de la
Stasi o la
Securitate.
Cualquier cosa puede ocurrir.
Estamos perdiendo el tiempo. Tenemos que vencerlos.
Tenemos que sentarnos y
pensar, trabajar una estrategia lo antes posible para conseguir el máximo
efecto. De otro modo, será demasiado tarde. ¿Qué puedo deciros? Mi
conclusión no es optimista.
Hasta ahora, a pesar del hecho de que tenemos
algunas fuerzas anti-UE en casi cada país, no es suficiente.
Estamos
perdiendo y perdiendo el tiempo.
