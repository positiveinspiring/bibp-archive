the World Bank and its sister organization the International
Monetary Fund
0:13
are very special
0:16
options they are sitting on top of the world's wealth which was
put into a
0:21
secret account and it has more gold than anybody knows about and
it is cloaked in
0:27
secrecy the bankers do not own that money
0:31
it's held in benefit for Humanity World Bank and the IMF are
listed on a special
0:39
agreement that was signed in nineteen fifty about that assets
it's gold it's
0:45
more golden people know about
0:46
it's over a million metric tons of gold and
the World Bank and
the IMF have a
0:54
special role to play
0:55
making sure that that money is spent to the benefit of humanity
1:00
so where's the gold a lot of people some people believe that the
golden Fort Knox
1:05
has disappeared
1:07
that's been in question for many years congressman have
attempted to get an
1:10
audit of the gold in Fort Knox to a million metric tons of gold
is not
1:15
something you can just hide where would you say that that gold
is being stored
1:20
four hundred thousand metric tons are in the central bank of the
Philippines
1:26
there's over two hundred thousand metric tons in Union Bank of
Switzerland and
1:31
some of that gold is buried securely in the Philippines as well
1:35
some of it is held in various banks but the bulk of it is in the
Philippines
1:40
so the world bank holds the note on that gold no it is in a
special trust account
1:46
that was set up by friend on Marcos and the authorized signatory
is a German
1:51
banker lawyer by the name of Wolfgang struck who also lives in
the Philippines
1:55
so how do how do the people get the gold back at if it's their
gold and it was
2:03
taken by these bankers
2:05
how do we receive it that is that
2:08
is the question and they're just sitting there illegally and
refusing to
2:13
relinquish it part of the problem is that it's this gold is
cloaked in
2:18
secrecy but in the last month of Wolfgang struck has been
publishing all
2:25
of the documentation so it's there for people to see we have the
originals and
2:30
people just have to make sure that the banks do what they are
required to do
