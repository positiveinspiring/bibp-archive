# PRISM Mining UFO Data - Targets False Flag ET Invasion as Pretext to 
Space Wars

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_nsa68.htm

New analysis (below video) of Edward
Snowden's June 9, 2013,
interview with the U.K. Guardian newspaper reveals how the
self-described NSA surveillance program whistleblower harbors
unconscious concerns about PRISM being used to mine online UFO
and ET contact-related data as part of an ongoing attempt by the
U.S. government to implement tyrannical space wars initiatives.
The Guardian
describes PRISM as a
massive top secret online spying program that,
"facilitates extensive, in-depth
surveillance on live communications and stored information.
The law allows for the targeting of any customers of
participating firms who live outside the US, or those
Americans whose communications include people outside the
US," which also "opens the possibility of communications
made entirely within the US being collected without
warrants."
A report published to alleged
PRISM-sponsor YouTube claims that when Edward Snowden (a
self-described former senior advisor for the Central
Intelligence Agency) cites the emergence of "new and unpredicted
threats" as a precedent for the assertion of claims by
government to unconstitutional powers, the former
telecommunications information systems officer is unconsciously
referencing a
false flag ET invasion scenario.
The
"Edward Snowden's Secret NSA Surveillance UFO Message" on
YouTube's (above video):
"The secret that Edward Snowden
dared not tell in his confessional video interview to the UK
Guardian relates how the formerly top secret PRISM
surveillance program is being used to mine online UFO and ET
contact-related data in an attempt to build a false flag ET
invasion case as a pretext to space wars and their
understandably disastrous consequences."
Unconscious
Disclosure
Reports of involuntary secret
messages encrypted backwards within human speech have been
substantiated by real-world events (below video) including one revelation
of military-grade intelligence pertaining to the "Shock and Awe"
strikes against Baghdad two years prior to the beginning of the
illegal U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Transmissions of these messages are
detected through the principal of reflection in which audio
recordings of human speech are digitally sampled then mirrored
for reverse playback and monitoring.
The principal of reflection
is widely accepted for use in scientific and engineering
applications, including the reflector telescope that offers
indirect observation of light from celestial objects through the
use of a highly-polished mirrored surface.
Occurrences of involuntary speech
are further known through incidents of sleep-talking and
Freudian slips, which convention dictates occur when unconscious
signals override voluntary control of the speech organs to offer
what can be highly-revealing statements of otherwise undisclosed
truths.
With this understanding of applied
reflection used in studies of involuntary human speech one can
consider the following excerpt from the Guardian interview of
Edward Snowden and the interpretation that follows.
Edward Snowden:
"The only thing that restricts
the activities of the surveillance state are policy.
Even our agreements with other
sovereign governments; we consider that to be a stipulation
of policy rather than a stipulation of law. And because of
that, a new leader will be elected, they'll flip the switch,
say that
'Because of the crisis,
because of the dangers that we face in the world', you
know, some new and unpredicted threat,
'We need more authority, we need more power.'
And there will be nothing the
people can do at that point to oppose it. And it will be
turn-key tyranny."
Secret Message:
"Those UFOs."
False Flag
Context
In a
2004 interview with investigative journalist Linda Moulton
Howe, Institute for Security and Cooperation in Outer Space
founder and president Dr. Carol Rosin
related Dr. Wernher von
Braun's anticipation during the 1970s that terrorists, asteroids
and ET's would be categorized under an American "Enemy's List"
to sustain "War Mode" and Pentagon budgets.
According to Dr. Rosin, the
Project
Paperclip scientist who led America's first landing on the moon
in 1969 mentored her in how,
"starting where I entered the
industry with the supposed Russian threat, but never actually
existed the Russians were made to be the enemy. Then there
would be terrorists, Third World country threats.
There would be
an asteroid threat. They might even say to us to try to
influence the public into believing that there are many reasons
for why we should put weapons in space. There might be a reason
to protect our assets in space.
"But, the real one that he was
always holding off on and would say again with tears filling
his eyes every time he said this to me repeatedly was that
the last card they are holding is the 'alien card,'
the extraterrestrial card and none of them are hostile.
In any way he could say those
words, the intonation was always on,
'None of them are
hostile. It's all a lie.'
So, in other words, all the
enemies that have been presented to us along the way it's
a lie with always the intention of seizing the high ground
to keep the truth from us."
Exopolitics
characterizes these events as "a succession of "False Flag Wars"
to follow the collapse of the permanent war economy's Communism
vs. Capitalism war (1945-1991).
These False Flag Wars,
-
start with a
"War on Terror"
-
followed by a False Flag "War Against the
Asteroids and Near Earth Objects"
-
finally a False Flag "War
Against Extraterrestrial Civilizations"
"Each of these wars, starting
with the False Flag operation of September 11, 2001 has had
the weaponization of space and occupation of the solar
system as a significant objective."
For Reasons
of Disclosure
During the Guardian interview,
Edward Snowden cited his reasons for allegedly leaking the NSA
PRISM documents.
With the UFO and ET contact-related
issues underlying his concerns now more clearly illuminated, his
statements regarding a culture of denial begin to take on
entirely new and perhaps unanticipated meaning.
"When you're in positions of
privileged access like a systems administrator for these
sort of intelligence community agencies, you're exposed to a
lot more information on a broader scale than the average
employee.
And because of that you see things that may be
disturbing but over the course of a normal person's career
you'd only see one or two of these instances.
"When you see everything, you
see them on a more frequent basis. And you recognize that
some of these things are actually abuses. And when you talk
to people about them in a place like this where this is the
normal state of business,
people tend not to take them very seriously."
"The more you talk about it the more you're
ignored, the more you're told that it's not a problem. Until
eventually you realize that these things need to be
determined by the public, not by somebody who was simply
hired by the government."
Targeting ET
Persons
In light of the newly-revealed UFO
and ET contact-related context in which the NSA PRISM leak
appears to have occurred, further meaning can also be derived
from U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's
written response, suggesting how PRISM could be targeting ET
persons of interest.
The June 6, 2013 "DNI
Statement on Activities Authorized Under Section 702 of FISA"
describes how,
"Activities authorized by
Section 702 are subject to oversight by the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch, and
Congress.
They involve extensive procedures, specifically
approved by the court, to ensure that
only non-U.S.
persons outside the U.S. are targeted, and that minimize the acquisition, retention and
dissemination of incidentally acquired information about
U.S. persons."
PRISM's FAA
Cover
The origins of the acronym PRISM can
be traced to the Federal Aviation Administration's
Privacy Impact Assessment program.
According to the
Department of Transportation website, the following explanations
offer official cover for what has since been revealed as a
massive corporate-sponsored online surveillance operation:
On why PRISM collects information:
"PRISM collects information in order to fulfill basic accounting
functions relating to the requisition of goods or services. The
PRISM system collects PII only when an individual requires an
accounting relationship with FAA."
Regarding how PRISM uses
information:
"Users of PRISM are involved with the procurement
of goods and services as well as the maintenance and security of
the supporting information needed to accomplish these tasks for
FAA.
Included within a wide variety of groups who use PRISM are,
-
user organizations with staff functioning as Contracting
Officer's Technical Representatives (COTRs)
-
requisitioners of
goods and services and their approvers
-
funds certifiers who
ensure that the monies are available and are accurate
-
the
actual Contracting Officer (CO) for each purchase made through
PRISM
-
System Administrators (SAs)
-
site security officers
who ensure that PRISM operates correctly and security
requirements are met."
Profound
Lawlessness
During a June 9, 2013, interview
with
Iranian PressTV, international law expert
Alfred
Lambremont Webre argued that in terms of the alleged
legality of NSA spying on Internet users, DNI,
"James Clapper is
lying because under the
Obama administration, his use of section
215 of the legislation that he's citing, in which he's saying
that any tangible item of anyone can be taken, from financial
records to any other records.
"The actions that he is undertaking
violate the first amendment of the US Constitution of freedom of
speech; the fourth amendment against unreasonable search and
seizure; the fifth amendment against self-incrimination; and the
fourteenth amendment as applied to all of the states. So, this
is an absolute legal falsehood.
And it goes along with the legal
falsehood that the CIA earlier has attempted to give to the
Obama drone program, which likewise is a violation of the
Constitution."
The founder of Exopolitics
emphasized how with the implementation of online PRISM
surveillance,
"Mr. Obama has in fact taken the title from
George
W. Bush and become
the most lawless president in US history."
