The data protection commissioner in Luxembourg
has launched an investigation into Skypes covert involvement with
surveillance programs run by the
National Security Agency (NSA), according to a report Friday.
The
link between the NSA and Skype is hardly
secret at this point, especially given the
exposure of "Project Chess," the secret
program aimed at making Skype calls
easily available to intelligence agencies.
Furthermore, in early June it was revealed that
Skype was one of the partners
working with the NSA on their massive
Prism
program.
Skype, owned by Microsoft, could face both
administrative and criminal sanctions, including a ban on secretly passing
any user communications to US intelligence agencies, the
Guardian reports.
If the investigation finds that Skypes data
sharing is found to violate Luxembourgs data protection laws, the company,
headquartered in the European country, could also be fined.
The Guardian reports that this
investigation, launched by Gerard Lommel, apparently began in June after
Skypes ties to NSA surveillance were revealed.
In Luxembourg, communications can only be
monitored with judicial approval or authorization of a tribunal established
by the prime minister.
As the Guardian notes, "it is unclear
whether Skypes transfer of communications to the NSA have been sanctioned
by Luxembourg through a secret legal assistance or data transfer agreement
that would not be known to the data protection commissioner at the start of
their inquiry."
Indeed, some European countries,
including Germany, have
worked closely with the NSA on their
surveillance program despite data protection laws.
This led to the German interior minister
advising people to
avoid using Google and Facebook if theyre
concerned about NSA spying.
As the Guardian
reported in July, after Skype was acquired
by Microsoft,
"the NSA boasted that a new capability had
tripled the amount of Skype video calls being collected through Prism."
"It is what many of us feared, and now we
know for sure," Grégoire Pouget, an
information security expert with Reporters Without Borders, said
to the Guardian.
"If you are a journalist working on issues
that could interest the US government or some of their allies, you
should not use Skype," Pouget said.
When a Microsoft representative spoke to
VentureBeat, they suggested that the investigation in Luxembourg may stem
from complaints filed by
Europe v. Facebook, which I reported on in
June.
"We regularly engage in a dialogue with data
protection authorities around the world and are always happy to answer
their questions," the Microsoft representative said to
VentureBeat.
"It has been previously widely reported that
the Luxembourg [data protection authority] was one of the [data
protection authorities] that received complaints from the Europe v.
Facebook group, so were happy to answer any questions they may have,"
the representative added.
Interestingly, the Guardian reported that
Microsoft would not respond for comment.
The data protection commissioners office in
Luxembourg did not respond to either VentureBeat or the Guardian for
comment.
