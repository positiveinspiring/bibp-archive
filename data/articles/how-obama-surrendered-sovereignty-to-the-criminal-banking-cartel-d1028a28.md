Part 1
Obama and the Criminal International Banking
Cartel
April 1, 2013
In
Bailout,
we showed over and over how criminal frauds perpetrated by huge banks
victimized Main Street on a colossal scale. One theme throughout the movie
is that bailouts are, in their essence, a perversion of the Rule of Law that
can only grow like a cancer.
It now appears that the bailout cancer has
metastasized with the
renunciation of the Rule of Law by the United States Attorney General,
without objection or much of a ruckus, before the Senate Judiciary
Committee:
I am concerned that the size of some of these
institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to
prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if
you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the
national economy, perhaps even the world economy.
Eric Holder, March 6,
2013.
As an initial observation, is that not a strange
way for any law enforcer, much less the top cop in the world's powerful
nation, to speak - in the passive voice, of being hit, in an effort to
rationalize his own failure to enforce the law?
And whos issuing
indications that make the head of the DOJ shrink in fear of discharging
his duties anyhow? Well answer the latter question with a list of names in
Part Two.
For now, lets be clear about whats on the
table when the U.S. Attorney General comes before Congress to testify: it
includes the status of the U.S. as a sovereign nation.
And thats simply
because the enforcement of criminal law falls within the exclusive province
of a states authority.
Sovereignty is the power of a state to govern
itself, such as making,
executing, and applying laws; imposing and collecting
taxes; making war and peace; and forming treaties or engaging in commerce
with foreign nations.
Private citizens cannot bring criminal actions.
States bring them, often even when private victims do not wish to press
charges, as retribution for harms to the public. That prerogative is inherent
in a state's sovereign power to protect itself from criminals.
In the U.S.,
executing federal criminal law is the duty of the U.S. Attorney General,
the
head of the Department of Justice and chief law enforcement officer of the
Federal Government.
Above him in the executive branch org chart, there
is but one entry: President Barack Obama.
Execution of the law was squarely in the
crosshairs when Eric Holder testified before the Senate. Specifically at
issue was the DOJs wholesale failure to prosecute any large banks or any of
their executives despite seemingly endless waves of uncontested evidence of
criminal behavior (not to mention the disappearance of
at least $13 trillion in a
financial crisis driven by fraud).
Were not talking about a few
slip-ups here and there by the DOJ, or a couple of favors done with a nudge
and a wink.
Were talking about what looks very much like a green light for
big banks to commit crimes with wild abandon while pretending that fines
levied in lieu of prosecution,
-
are something other than a small tax paid
by the banks doing business as criminal enterprises
-
cannot simply be
paid for from the fruit of additional crimes in the future
-
do
not guarantee more crime
Eric Holder did not materialize before the
Senate out of the blue.
Rather, his testimony followed an unbroken pattern
of prosecutorial inaction and deference by the DOJ towards big bailed out
banks, a sample of which includes:
-
In April 2010, Richard Bowen, a former
Citigroup risk officer, told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission,
among other things, that Citi sold MBS products despite knowing - based on
information that Bowen provided to the top ranks of the company,
including ex-CEO Robert Rubin - that
huge swaths of mortgages owned by Citi were defective to the tune of
between 60 and 80%.
Citi continued its multi-billion-dollar sales of
defective MBS products that it knew to be falsely rated.
The DOJ filed no criminal referrals and prosecuted no
one at Citigroup.
-
In June 2010, it emerged that
Wells Fargo (nee: Wachovia),
-
had made a habit of helping move money
for Mexican drug smugglers. Wells Fargo & Co., which bought Wachovia in
2008, has admitted in court that its unit failed to monitor and report
suspected money laundering by narcotics traffickers - including the
cash used to buy four planes that shipped a total of 22 tons of
cocaine.
The DOJ filed no criminal
referrals and prosecuted no one at either Wells Fargo or Wachovia.
-
In September 2012, Lanny Breuer, then the
head of criminal enforcement at the DOJ, traveled from Washington, D.C.
to give a speech to the New York City Bar Association.
Breuer's house
call to the corporate defense bar included statements that he would not
always be convinced not to prosecute large institutions that made
compelling presentations to Breuer, in his conference room,
concerning the negative economic ramifications of such prosecutions.
-
In December 2012, Lanny Breuer
admitted that HSBC,
What is more,
The DOJ filed no criminal referrals and prosecuted
no one at HSBC -
despite
the fact that,
-
On January 22, 2013, Lanny Breuer appeared
in PBS Frontlines The
Untouchables, which investigated fraudulent mortgages originated
and sold by Bank of America (nee: Countrywide).
Breuer stated that for large financial institutions,
-
pursuing
justice
in any given case meant that he should speak to
experts, because if I bring a case against institution A,
and as a result of bringing that case, theres some huge economic effect
- if it creates a ripple effect so that suddenly, counterparties and
other financial institutions or other companies that had nothing to do
with this are affected badly - its a factor we need to know and
understand.
As a result of the latter,
[l]ess
than 24 hours after 'The Untouchables' aired on PBS, its main target,
Justice Department criminal-division head Lanny Breuer, abruptly resigned.
Breuers disclosure - made with no hint of irony
or shame, nor with any legal authority for support - that the DOJ was
deferring to unnamed experts whenever large financial institutions were
involved was not the only such admission by the Justice Department.
In yet another criminal case that saw no
prosecutions, namely, Libor manipulation by UBS, a Swiss Bank,
Eric Holder used language essentially identical to that which led to
Breuers resignation:
We reach out to experts outside of the
Justice Department to talk about what are the consequences of
actions that we might take, what would be the impact of those actions if we
want to make particular prosecutive decisions or determinations with regard
to a particular institution.
Finally, on January 29 of this year, Congress
seemed to connect this untrammeled crime spree with the DOJ's docility when
Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Charles Grassley (R-IA, the ranking member
of the Judiciary Committee) fired off a
letter to Eric Holder.
Among other things, they demanded,
the names of
all outside experts consulted by the Justice Department in making
prosecutorial decisions regarding financial institutions with over $1
billion in assets.
They also demanded to know how the,
DOJ ensure[d] that
these experts provided unconflicted and unbiased advice to DOJ.
The importance of the latter point is impossible
to overstate given the DOJ's responsibility for bringing criminal cases at
the federal level.
By demanding to know what measures the Justice Department
was taking to insure against self-dealing by experts, the senators touch on
something far deeper than a garden variety conflict of interest.
The real question they are posing is whether the
DOJs outside experts are in reality the large financial institutions
themselves, because if they are, their opinion that prosecution should be
foregone - which the DOJ has followed without exception - is a bald assertion of
sovereign immunity: huge banks are claiming their own exemption from
criminal prosecution based on their identities as huge banks, and Eric
Holder's DOJ has never disagreed.
And here we run up against that word again:
sovereign.
Before considering the IMPLICATIONS should it
turn out that the international cartel of bailed out banks is exempting
itself from the reach of the law by "advising" the DOJ on prosecutions of
its members, it is worth examining the claim, articulated by Holder, that
"negative economic consequences" would attend the criminal prosecution of
any cartel members.
In different contexts and guises, we have heard
that claim of "systemic failure" before, and its public failure on the
merits is so impressively robust that to see the DOJ so much as entertain
the discredited claim at this point - much less fall for it hook, line, and
sinker - is so breathtaking that it begs the question:
What's really behind
the DOJ's capitulation to the banks?
-
In September 2008, Treasury Secretary Henry
Paulson told Congress that the nation would descend into martial law unless
TARP was passed. Paulson's urgency was driven by toxic assets on the banks'
books. Unless $700 billion of these toxic assets were removed immediately
through a massive Treasury purchase, Paulson said, Armageddon would quickly
follow.
Immediately after Congress passed TARP, however,
Paulson changed his mind without batting an eye and used the $700 billion to
directly recapitalize the bailed out banking cartel, toxic assets be damned.
Whether Paulson intentionally deceived the public when he made his initial
claim is beside the point.
What matters is that his threat - buy the toxic
assets or plunge into Depression - proved toothless as a matter of fact: none
of the TARP money was used to purchase toxic assets, and yet the country
avoided the cliff dive Paulson had sworn would result.
Did Eric Holder simply sleep through this
episode?
-
Less than a year later, the cartel floated a
miniature version of its Armageddon claim in federal district court.
In
Bloomberg v. the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve
argued that disclosing, in response to FOIA requests, the names of (and
amounts borrowed by) bailed out banks using the Feds Primary Dealer Credit
Facility (PDCF) would result in competitive harm to the institutions
involved. In support, the Fed submitted a rash of expert affidavits from
bankers explaining how competitive harm would come to the banks that used
the Fed's PDCF facility if the FOIA disclosures were made.
The Chief Judge of the Federal District Court
for the Southern District of New York, Loretta Preska, dismissed the
bankers' argument:
At best, the proffered affidavits suggest
that the borrowers' competitors may use the knowledge that a borrower
participated in a Federal Reserve lending program in order to determine
when the borrower is in a weakened condition" and spread that
information to the borrowers' shareholders or the market in general.
But
the risk of looking weak to competitors and shareholders is
an inherent risk of market participation; information
tending to increase that risk does not make the information privileged
or confidential under Exemption 4.
In other words, tough shit: bankers must cope
with the real world just like the rest of us no matter how big or important
they think they are.
Know what happened next? The FOIA disclosures went
forward without so much as a ripple in the financial markets.
More fundamentally, though, if the cartel's
narrow argument that mere competitive harm would afflict a group of banks is
legally flawed, then its far broader claim that Armageddon would befall the
earth if a single bank (or banker, for that matter) were prosecuted is dead
on arrival as a matter of law.
So why does Eric Holder accept the absurdly
overbroad claim at face value as a legal proposition each and every time it
is made?
-
From 2008-11,
Neil Barofsky was the Special Inspector General of the Troubled Asset
Relief Program (SIGTARP), in charge of ensuring that TARP funds were
distributed to the bailed out banks with a minimum of fraud.
He wrote about
his day-to-day battles with banking apologists, including Treasury Secretary
Tim Geithner, in Bailout,
published last year.
At the end of the book, Barofsky relays a stunning
admission by Geithner: the claim that an institution is "systemic" is in all
actuality a conclusory label rather than a meaningful analytical tool for
assessing what might happen in the future.
Says Geithner:
If Tim "Bailouter-in-Chief"
Geithner, a man with no formal education in either law or economics, is able
to see that claims of systemic importance are intellectually bankrupt, why
can't the U.S. Attorney General?
This brings up another clue about who the
anonymous DOJ experts are through the process of elimination: they aren't
from the U.S. Treasury, which we know from the
Senate Banking Committee hearing in February 2013.
There we learned that
Treasury told the Department of Justice it was not in a position to assess
whether HSBC should be prosecuted.
IMPLICATIONS
If the DOJ's anonymous experts turn out to be
the international cartel of bailed out banks, the implications are grave for
at least three reasons.
First
The entire legal doctrine of sovereign immunity is very likely
unconstitutional in the first place, premised as it is on the notion that
"the King can do no wrong."
Duke Law Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, the author
of a leading treatise on constitutional law, makes this very point when he
demonstrates, in his Stanford Law Review article Against
Sovereign Immunity, that,
sovereign immunity is inconsistent with three
fundamental constitutional principles: the supremacy of the Constitution and
federal laws; the accountability of government; and due process of law.
(p.
1210)
Second
The doctrine of systemic importance, even aside from being thoroughly
meritless for the reasons explained above, is impossibly vague in scope.
That became clear in the HSBC case.
There, the bank had,
"already
sacked all the senior staff involved in the scandal, and agreed to stringent
monitoring - the first time a foreign bank has agreed to such oversight."
Thus, even fully crediting the theory that prosecuting HSBC would have posed
systemic risk, that same theory does not and cannot explain why prosecuting
criminals outside of the bank would have posed any risk at all, much less
"systemic" risk.
Lanny Breuer must have been grateful for the mainstream
media's failure to ask him why systemic immunity extends to ex-employees
outside the system, or where such immunity ends.
It sure looks as if
the international bailed out banking cartel claims immunity for individual
bankers based on a calculation that extends protection to anyone in a
position to name names. Whatever the case, it is the whim of a cartel, and
not any Rule of Law, that determines who is prosecuted and who isn't - a
system that democracies have sought to avoid since the Magna Carta was
signed 800 years ago.
How's that for regressive?
Third
And most seriously, criminal
sovereign immunity is legally limited to the President of the United States.
That should tell you something about where the international cartel of
bailed out banks stands if it turns out to be the entity asserting
governmental immunity from the consequences of its own crimes.
While
sovereign immunity is considered a civil law doctrine, that's merely a
practical reality rather than a legal limitation. Criminal
cases are brought in the names of sovereign authorities themselves, either
by the United States or by individual states, and sovereign immunity is a
doctrine asserted as a defense.
A case in which a sovereign asserted a
sovereign immunity defense in response to criminal charges brought by a
sovereign would be a rarity indeed.
Nevertheless, there is legal authority that
directly addresses the scope of criminal sovereign immunity.
The issue arose
and was addressed during Watergate:
the Office of Legal Counsel ('OLC') prepared a
comprehensive memorandum in the fall of 1973 that analyzed whether all
federal civil officers are immune from indictment or criminal prosecution
while in office, and, if not, whether the President and Vice President in
particular are immune from indictment or criminal prosecution while in
office.
Criminal immunity was found to extend only to
the President:
The OLC memorandum concluded that all federal civil officers
except the President are subject to indictment and
criminal prosecution while still in office; the President is uniquely immune
from such process.
That same year, in a different case (the grand
jury investigation of Vice President Spiro Agnew), Robert Bork, then the
Solicitor General of the U.S., reached precisely the same conclusion as the OLC:
the President, unlike the Vice President, could not
constitutionally be subject to such criminal process while in office."
That ought to make the dead seriousness of
criminal immunity for the cartel of bailed out banks crystal clear.
If these
financial institutions and the anonymous experts relied on by the DOJ are
one and the same, then they have arrogated to themselves sovereign legal
power that's available under the law to the Chief Executive of the United
States and no one else. As things stand now, people who've been fired from a
bank in Hong Kong are on the same legal footing as the President of the
United States.
But let's get down to brass tacks. Since there
can't be two kings in a kingdom, its the international criminal banking
cartel - not President Obama - whos the real sovereign authority here.
Obama's
top law enforcer, Eric Holder, admits - fully in practice and nearly so in
his own words - to being trumped.
Obama's
announcement that bailed out banks have not committed any crimes, in the
face of overwhelming and undisputed evidence to the contrary, quite
accurately summarizes the system of sovereign immunity that is in effect:
the real King - banks - can do no wrong.
The President is merely their
messenger...
Part 2
Inside The Criminal Banking Cartel
April 14, 2013
The U.S. government openly conceded that its
sovereign authority to enforce its own laws is gone when Attorney General
Eric Holder testified
that the Justice Departments failure to prosecute any big banks is based on
anonymous expert opinions that prosecutions would destabilize the
financial system.
This notion of systemic importance has been
thoroughly discredited.
According to Tim Geithner, its an intellectually
bankrupt phrase. Whats more, its been debunked both legally and
empirically, which is likely one reason the
DOJs
experts wish to remain anonymous.
If it turns out that these experts are in fact
agents of the big banks whose crimes are being immunized by the very
entities whose discredited opinions the
DOJ
is relying on, then those opinions are nothing more than assertions of
criminal sovereign immunity - a privilege that is legally limited to the
President of the United States.
Since the
King
can do no wrong - the legal foundation of sovereign immunity - the real
King
here is the criminally immune cartel of banks, not the President, since real
sovereigns dont surrender the right to enforce their laws.
And following the long series of unprosecuted
crimes by the cartel, in which the Presidents own constituents are the
undisputed victims, surrender is the most charitable description of the
Obamas
acts before the banking cartel.
There are two very big and related clues as to
the identity of the anonymous experts behind whose opinions U.S. Attorney
General
Eric Holder
hides whenever explaining away his failure to prosecute big banks on the
basis of their systemic importance.
The first, noted in an article
last week by Golem
XIV, is a
list of
international banks that parade under the rather obvious label of Globally
Systemically Important Financial Institutions, or G-SIFIs.
There are 28 banks in total, 9 of them
headquartered in the U.S.:
-
Citigroup
-
Deustsche Bank
-
HSBC
-
JP Morgan Chase
-
Barclays
-
BNP Paribas
-
Bank of
America
-
Bank of New York Mellon
-
Credit Suisse
-
Goldman Sachs
-
Mitsubishi UFJ FG
-
Morgan Stanley
-
Royal Bank of Scotland
-
UBS
-
Bank of China
-
BBVA
-
Group BPCE
-
Group Credit Agricole
-
ING Bank
-
Mizuho FG
-
Nordea
-
Santander
-
Societe Generale
-
Standard Chartered
-
State Street
-
Sumitomo Mitsui FG
-
Unicredit Group
-
Wells Fargo
This
list of
cartel
members is updated annually by the Financial Stability Board, a collection
of international organizations.
The FSB is a global meta-body of bankers.
But the formal edifice, whether called the FSB
or the NWO, really doesnt matter, because, as Golem XIV
states:
Guess which institutions provide the membership for
all
of the above international bodies? Yes, you got it - the big banks.
These are the banks that are above the law in
the U.S.
In Part One above, we mentioned four banks -
Citigroup,
Wells Fargo,
HSBC, and
UBS - whose massive
crimes had been taxed at a de minimis rate by the Department of
Justice rather than prosecuted. All four are on the
list of G-SIFIs
above.
So what, you may ask, thats just a
list compiled by some
international convention of cokehead bankers, how do they make sure a rogue
federal prosecutor doesnt break ranks and haul a cartel member or two off
to criminal trial?
Enter clue no. 2: Covington & Burling, the law
firm from which both the head of the
DOJ (Eric
Holder) and the
DOJs
head of criminal enforcement (Lanny
Breuer) were recruited.
Actually, Breuer is no longer with the
DOJ. Following a
four-year stint in which the enforcer failed to prosecute a single big
bank, Breuer has returned to Covington & Burling, where he will earn be
rewarded with $4 million in annual compensation.
The significance of Covington & Burling lies in
its list of current
clients, which looks remarkably like the
list of criminally
immune cartel members above (particularly the more recognizable names):
Citigroup, Deutsche
Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of
America,
Goldman
Sachs, Morgan Stanley,
UBS,
Wells Fargo, and ING
Bank.
Not to put too fine a
point on it, but
Eric Holder and
Lanny Breuer have the
financial motivation not to prosecute their firms clients. In Breuers
case, it turned out to be $4 million of motivation. Per year.
Under any functioning system of law, of course,
both Holder and Breuer would submit to screening procedures at the
DOJ to insulate them
from prosecutorial decisions involving their former clients. We're sure
they did the same thing under our impotent system as well.
But so what? When laws against crimes are a dead
letter, who in his right mind would put any trust in a conflict screen?
As Cheyenne told Jill in Once Upon a Time in the
West,
when youve killed four, its easy to make it five.
Now commentators are starting to
point out where the
slippery slope of sovereign immunity for criminal banks will lead.
Jim Chanos, who detected the fraud at Enron well before it destroyed the company
and its shareholders, notes that not only are criminal cartel members now
motivated to continue cheating and stealing, they have a fiduciary duty to
do so.
(Speaking of the Enron-ization of the U.S.,
Eric Holder is
working to release CEO Jeff Skilling from prison early in yet another act of
prostrate submission before his real masters, the criminal banks.)
As Golem XIV points out, immunity extends not
only to criminal behavior, but to assets that a cartel member bank acquires
through crime:
if by doing those illegal things [the bank] makes out-sized
profits for its shareholders and staff, that money, those profits are also
above the law.
Cyprus Vs. MF Global - The Rule Of Law Is Dead
Thus, anyone who thinks account confiscation a
la Cyprus cant happen in the U.S. is dreaming of a bygone republic.
Not
only is account seizure possible in the U.S., or even likely, it is
guaranteed. Just ask MF Globals segregated account holders or GM senior
bondholders if you have any doubts.
In the MF Global case, Jon Corzine,
brazenly
took liquid assets like Treasuries and warehouse receipts, but not cash
which would have been more quickly missed, from customer accounts to post as
illegal collateral for emergency funding with a lender who must have known
that they were receiving stolen goods.
The lender, of course, turned out to
be JP Morgan - a prominent international cartel member.
Jon Corzine was of
course one of
Obama's
top fundraisers and an alumnus of
Goldman Sachs
- a
cartel member.
In the GM bankruptcy, the age-old pecking order
of creditor priority was turned upside down, literally rewriting law, when
senior unsubordinated secured creditors' claims were trumped by payouts
to junior unsecured creditors in a patently political sop to
Obama's perceived
union supporters.
In both cases, the black letter law that's
supposed to gird markets with trust and predictability was trampled in favor
of Obama's
political allies.
Now that
Obama has altogether surrendered the
DOJ's law
enforcement functionality to the criminal international banking cartel,
those dangerous precedents turn out to have been short-sighted in the
extreme: there is nothing left to stop the plunder of customer accounts in
Cyprus from crashing like a tidal wave across U.S. shores. The timing
depends only on the restraint that the banking cartel elects to show.
There is no remedy in sight, only more financial
crime as Americans are robbed deeper into serfdom. The Executive Branch is
merely an agent of the criminal banking cartel for the reasons given. That
fact, in turn, has cut the Judiciary out of the equation altogether: a court
cannot try criminals who are never brought before it to face charges.
That leaves Congress, which in theory could
initiate impeachment proceedings. But how likely is success when the Senate,
which would try any impeachment cases, couldnt even obtain the names of the
DOJs so-called
experts in the first place?
As noted in Part One above,
Senator
Grassley
asked the
DOJ for the
experts names in a letter on
January 29, 2013.
Eric Holder testified on March 6, more than a month later.
The
issue of the experts identities was thus as ripe as could be, but rather
than obtaining the names, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee put
on a clinic in how to conduct an incompetent examination:
Q.
On January 29, Senator Sherrod Brown and I requested details on
who these so-called 'experts' are. So far we have not received any
information. Maybe you're going to but why have we not yet been provided
the names of experts the DOJ consults as we requested on
January 29?
We continue to find out why we aren't having these high-profile cases.
A:
We will endeavor to answer your letter, Senator.
We did not, as I understand it, endeavor to obtain experts outside of the
government in making determinations with regard to
HSBC.
Just putting that aside for a minute though, the
concern that you have raised is one that I, frankly, share.
I'm not
talking about HSBC
here, that would be inappropriate. But I am concerned that the size of some
of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us
to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if we do prosecute - if we do bring a criminal charge
- it will have a
negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.
I
think that is a function of the fact that some of these institutions have
become too large.
Again, I'm not talking about
HSBC, this is more of
a general comment. I think it has an inhibiting influence, impact on our
ability to bring resolutions that I think would be more appropriate. I think
that's something that we - you all [Congress] - need to consider. The concern that you raised is actually one that I share.
Note that
Senator Grassley
asked one question: why havent you answered our letter? Holder doesnt
answer it. Instead, he promises to supply the names later. At that
point, Grassley
should have put two questions to Holder. First, answer my question by
explaining why you ignored our letter. Second, when will you supply the
names of the so-called experts?
A mediocre first-year litigation associate
wouldve gotten this information within seconds. But not
Senator Grassley, who
earned his masters degree during the Eisenhower Administration.
Here is his
completely irrelevant follow-up question:
Q: Do you believe that the investment bankers
that were repackaging bad mortgages that were AAA-rated are guilty of fraud
or is it a case of just not being aggressive or effective enough to prove
that they did something fraudulent and criminal?
Huh? Not surprisingly,
Eric Holder has been
in no hurry to disclose the names of the experts retained by Covington & Burlings clients since dancing around Grassley like a cigar store Indian.
Holder has completely blown off the Senate, which has done nothing to follow
up the issue.
Frankly this disgusting charade has surprised no
one whos paying any attention, coming, as it does, from the same august
body that exempted itself from insider trading laws and has failed to pass
any meaningful reform legislation since the 2008 meltdown, an even worse
repeat of which is on its way.
On the contrary, both Congress and the Executive
Branch are now just tools of fraud used by the criminal international
banking cartel against the people, who for their part are drooling iDope
dreams oblivious to their own
last act, proving Edward Murrow right, a nation of sheep having
begotten a government of wolves.
