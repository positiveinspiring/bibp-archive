This presentation constitutes an Apocalypse in both meanings of the word:
-
A disclosure to select readers: those
capable of advanced discernment 1
-
A disclosure concerning the end of the
era of predatory capitalism and the beginning of a new Holocaust
2 era
It requires a concerted effort to comprehend the enormity of what cabal
capitalists are currently perpetrating: outrages so monstrous - yet hidden
and somewhat gradual - that most people aren't able to discern them.
In this essay we'll investigate how the cabal is using its economic
terrorist attacks as a means of destroying American society utterly and on
its ashes attempting to create a new political-economic world order,
quickening America's and the world's descent into a new Holocaust.
We'll
also explore how we can survive this Cataclysm and overcome the demonic
forces perpetrating it.
Current financial crises are cabal-planned-and-executed terrorist
"false-flag" attacks 3 on American workers: an operation in which a nation
attacks itself but makes it appear that an enemy has committed the attack,
provoking peace-loving people into fighting against the demonized enemy.
In the present situation, the "enemy" is said to be "happenstance," as
though current economic crises are merely accidental in nature - when, in
fact, they are deliberately caused by the capitalist cabal. These are not
crises for wealthy cabal members, because they looted their own personal
billions from taxpayer money when they began the crises and continue to
steal billions of bailout tax-payer dollars.
The chart below helps us get a graphic sense of the stupendous amount of
tax-payer dollars the predatory capitalists have STOLEN (through November
2008) from American workers (dollar amounts adjusted to November 2008
inflated terms).
In all of U.S. history, adding up all the nation's large expenditures - never
before has this much money been looted from American taxpayers - in a single
year!
All these huge past projects put together equal only about one-third
of what the predatory capitalists have stolen from American workers and
given to incompetent, demonic capitalist predators - in the form of
multi-million dollar salaries, bonuses, and bailouts.
Take a moment to contemplate all those historical super-expenditures.
Then let the monstrous nature of
capitalist looting hit you with full force:
$9.2 TRILLION stolen from us - almost 3 times as
much as all previous super-expenditures combined.
That towering amount of money represents between 75-105% of the total gross
domestic product (GDP) of the entire United States economy. Any competent
economist recognizes that "spending" over about 5% of GDP will result in a
total collapse of the American economy - which is what's happened.
In
previous essays we've explained how the U.S. economy has already collapsed
and a second Great Depression has seized the nation and the world. American
workers have lost $6 trillion of housing wealth and another $8 trillion in
stock wealth.
Hyman Minsky, noted economist and Washington University economics professor,
helps us understand how the American economy has been progressively
corrupted:
If you've made the effort to realize the monstrousness of the current
looting of workers by cannibalistic plutocrats, then you'll understand that
the demonic cabal will find it necessary to move to very repressive measures
to try to keep workers from reacting with violence against their capitalist
murderers.
"History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse,
intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over
governments . . ."
President James Madison
Disclosure of the Cabal's Planned Atrocities
On March 13, 2008, the U.S. House of Representatives met in secret for only
the fourth time in its history. Strategies revealed at that secret meeting
were so outrageous that some persons who attended later leaked what had been
divulged by Congressional toadies of the cabal.
Members of the House of Representatives, in secret session, were told that
the tactics of the cabal, in perpetrating an economic-political-military
terrorist attack against the American people, include:
-
Collapse of U.S. economy in late 2008
-
Collapse of U.S. political-economic system in mid-2009
-
Civil war in 2009
-
The advanced roundup of U.S. citizens"
- deemed to be insurgents - citizens
provoked to move against the government
-
The detention of those rounded up at the
FEMA and Rex84 camps constructed
throughout the U.S.
-
The possible public retaliation against members of Congress for the
collapses
-
The location of safe facilities for members of Congress and their
families to reside in during this massive civil unrest
-
Necessary and unavoidable merger of the U.S. with Canada and Mexico
establishing the
North American Union (NAU)
-
The issuance of a new NAU currency called
the Amero for all three nations
as an economic solution
-
IMMINENT MARTIAL LAW
The international capitalist cabal has destroyed the American and world
economies and now finds it necessary to impose totalitarian repression on
American citizens, resulting in a new Holocaust...
As We Speak...
The cabal and its ancillary organizations (including Islamic think tanks)
are already creating the new totalitarian capitalist world:
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Obama's cabal controller, says unemployment will lead
to riots.
"The establishment of a new world economic equilibrium on a capitalist basis
can be achieved only through a massive destruction of existing productive
forces, a catastrophic lowering of the living standards of the international
working class, and, for this to be realized, the annihilation of a
substantial section of the worlds population." 4
Germany 1930s and America 2009
We can get a much better idea of our present situation if we compare and
contrast what's happening in the U.S. in 2009 and what occurred in Germany
in the 1930s.
We've already seen the almost identical features of the Bush
tyranny and the Hitler dictatorship.
Now we can compare Obama's demagogy with that of the 1930 Nazi regime.
In
both instances, the political and economic conditions were so catastrophic
that a new "Messiah-Despot" was sought by the people. Political corruption
and runaway inflation had destroyed the German republic as it has the
American republic.
It would be incorrect to say that Barack Obama is the same as Adolph Hitler,
but events surrounding Obama thus far are very similar to those that
surrounded Hitler and they both served the same purposes of their capitalist
masters and instituted very similar operations:
-
Self-promoting books used as Bibles (Mein Kampf and
Dreams From My Father)
for converts to the Hitler and Obama cults
-
Highly choreographed mass rallies
-
Intimidation of opponents in the press by thugs and crooked lawyers: Local
law enforcement abusing their power to suppress dissent from Obama's
message. In one case, a group naming itself "Barack Obama's Truth Squad," a
group of prosecuting attorneys and local sheriffs in
Missouri, traveled around Missouri to "fight the smear" and investigate
anti-Obama literature as "criminal fraud."
-
Divisive rhetoric and demonization of opponents
-
They both created a
Gestapo secret police force
-
Cover-up of independent sources of information about their past: as in the
University of Chicago - Illinois library's putting the Chicago Annenberg
Challenge documents out of reach after the first reports of the Ayers-Obama
connection, at the request of "an anonymous donor"
-
Covert support of rich capitalists: the cabal's $430 million in campaign
donations has bought their control over Obama just as money from German
capitalists bought control of Hitler's regime
Hitler's ecstatic followers
Vulture Capitalism Picks Over the Carcasses
Due to the ravages of predatory capitalism, our civilization is in the fifth
stage of collapse as depicted by Dimitry Orlov:
-
Financial Collapse
-
Commercial Collapse
-
Political Collapse
-
Social Collapse
-
Cultural Collapse
Dimitry Orlov, "The Five Stages of Collapse"
This is precisely why the capitalists have wreaked such widespread havoc:
because they plan to create a new global political-economic-social regime on
the ashes of their civilizational holocaust.
The cabal, in its unbridled arrogance, announces its demonic schemes in
books written by cabal lackeys and in articles in Foreign Affairs, the
official organ of its primary "terrorist" planning cult: the Council on
Foreign Relations.
There's nothing more absurd than a Henry Kissinger, a
Zbibniew Brzezinski,
or a Hillary Clinton - mandarins of the demonic cabal - pontificating on how
the world ought to be run.
The supposedly superior groups of foreign policy
advisors -
Council on Foreign Relations,
Trilateral Commission,
Bilderberg
group - are farcical in their presumption of knowledge and understanding.
In a recent interview with his disciple Charlie Rose,
Henry Kissinger
pontificated that current global crises should be seen as an opportunity to
move toward a borderless world where national interests are outweighed by
global necessities.
Henry was "announcing" the cabal's current scheme to
destroy much of the world in order to build a new "one world order."
"Never have so many transformations occurred at the same time in so many
different parts of the world and been made globally accessible via
instantaneous communication. The alternative to a new international order is
chaos."
Henry A. Kissinger, "The chance for a new world order"
International Herald Tribune, January 12, 2009
"It is interesting that in Kissingers opinion editorial, he states in his
own terms that the only solution to all of the financial and political
problems occurring around the world is a new international order. What he
doesnt say is that most of these problems have been created by the same
people who are offering a new international order as a solution. How can any
sane person trust the same people who have screwed up the world so badly, to
fix the problems? It is entirely absurd."
Lee Rogers
"The New World Order Is Almost In Place," roguegovernment.com
Much the same message was peddled by Richard N. Gardner in an earlier
article in Foreign Affairs, "The Hard Road to World Order."
"The efforts of the United States to offset the deterioration of its world
economic position, dramatically exposed in the ongoing crisis, will assume
an increasingly reckless and unrestrained militaristic character." 5
The Cabal's New Holocaust
Referring to the cabal's societal annihilation as a new Holocaust is not
merely a figure of speech: this demonic group of super-rich people is
deliberately creating conditions that are resulting in the death of millions
worldwide.
This essay encourages you to become fully aware that the cabal is now
engaged in a program of atrocities that is hyperbolic.6 As their
mandarins and spin-meisters are making clear: they have detonated
political-economic-social collapse on an order never seen before in American
history.
The cabal presumes that it can use this condition of world-anarchy
to foist a new cabal-dominated world order on all other nations.
"Is it an irresponsible overstatement to associate the treatment of
Palestinians with this criminalized Nazi record of collective atrocity?
[Holocaust] I think not."
Richard Falk, the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the
Occupied Palestinian Territory and international law authority at Princeton
University, 2009
In Palestine,
holocaust conditions have been created by Israel and the
American cabal for decades. In America, the devastation has already resulted
in such holocaust conditions as:
-
35.9 million Americans now living below the poverty line, including 12.9
million children (according to the US Census Bureau)
-
At least 25% of American workers unemployed, though the rigged government
figures report it to be only 7.2 %. 7
-
Over 2 million Americans having lost their homes to foreclosure since
January, 2007; 12,000 homes a day continuing to go into foreclosure
-
American workers having lost $10 to $15 trillion in the value of their
homes
-
American retirees losing $2 trillion in retirement funds (of the total of
$9 trillion in late 2007) due to the fall in the stock market
-
Home foreclosure filings surging 57 percent in the 12 month-period ending
in March, 2008
-
Bank repossessions soaring 129 percent from 2007 to 2008
-
1 out of every 4 American veterans now being homeless (out of a total of
3.5 million homeless Americans)
-
Of the 1.6 million Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, 38% of Army and 50% of
National Guard service members being diagnosed with mental illness. (2007
Pentagon report)
-
The United States having the third worst level of income inequality and
poverty among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) 30 member states (only Mexico and Turkey ranked worse in those
categories)
This kind of devastation is already going on, as America rapidly collapses
into cataclysm. With the new Obama
con-man regime, we'll see even more
demonic ruination. Before Obama even took office he
announced his plans to
cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. 8
As with all other campaign promises, Obama will renege on his vow to
"protect Social Security for future generations":
Social Security can be reduced or destroyed, taxpayer money in the trillions
looted, war crimes perpetrated, Constitutional liberties obliterated,
workers murdered in senseless wars or through unemployment and homeslessness
- because
the cabal has taken on unchecked dictatorial powers.
"That the United States, once touted as the 'world's greatest democracy,' is
now ruled by a presidential dictatorship is a fact beyond any serious
dispute... The theory holds that the president has the arbitrary right to
ignore any law that he feels is an unconstitutional infringement of his
power and a law is automatically unconstitutional if the president feels
it infringes on his power.
This neatly-squared circle makes Congress
irrelevant and removes the judiciary from the loop altogether. Thus the only
effective power left in the land is the 'unitary executive' - the fancy
modern name that the legal minions of President George W. Bush [and now
President Obama] have given to the ancient concept of "tyranny."

"Power, Paranoia and Presidential Tyranny"
A Hyperbolic Cataclysm Made Possible By Citizen Ignorance
Persons reading my essays sometimes ask why it's possible for me to continue
writing such critical material if, indeed, we are now living in a police
state.
Part of the answer was given in a movie entitled
My Dinner With
Andre.
America is "the new model for the new concentration camp where the camp has
been built by the inmates themselves and the inmates are the guards and they
have this pride in this thing they've built. They've built their own prison
and so they exist in a state of schizophrenia where they are both guards and
prisoners. And as a result, having been lobotomized, they no longer have the
capacity to leave the prison they've made or to even see it as a prison."
"My Dinner With Andre"
by Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory
The minds of Americans have been so "lobotomized" by
mis-education,
television, and ubiquitous societal brainwashing that they don't YET require
the jack-book kind of police state the German Nazis instigated in the 1930s.
TV commercials "sell" not merely products, but a lifestyle based on a
consumer mind-set. Day in and day out, twenty-five thousand times a year,
television commercials hypnotize us into seeing ourselves as consumers to be
entertained rather than citizens to be informed and actively engaged in
sustaining and improving our society.
"Democracy, whether in Sweden or the United States, depends on the voters
capacity to think. If you have read the best of what has been thought and
said, then your cognition and understanding is on a much higher level than
if you have read Harry Potter or Stephen King.
So what this decline into
half-literature and mediocre media really means is de facto a
self-destruction of democracy."
Harold Bloom
January 12, 2008
Progressive material, such as this essay and others on our Website, isn't
seen as dangerously subversive by the cabal because they know that most
Americans don't have the mental capacity to understand:
Unfortunately, some emails we receive from readers bear out the cabal's
negative judgment. As I'm writing this essay, for example, I received an
email that asks:
"Would it not be better to have a completely free market than to have a
socialistic system as you suggest? A free market takes care of itself, and
shows what the people want. On the other hand, a socialist society is easily
corruptible, and takes away freedoms of the individual."
This person lacks the mental acuity to understand that recent events have
conclusively demonstrated that the so-called "free-market," never free from
manipulation by moneyed crooks, has imploded. He says he's read my material
but he erroneously asserts that I suggest a "socialistic system."
His mind
is so programmed that he can only repeat the capitalist mantra:
"a free
market takes care of itself, and shows what people want."
Such a person is
like a man who's being threatened by a killer pointing a gun in his face who
asks you benightedly:
"Isn't it nice that this man pays me so much
attention?"
Training Workers Worldwide to Think and Act Progressively
The present catastrophic world situation has been created by:
-
The capitalist cabal organizing itself to seize and abuse
political-economic-social power in the United States, Europe, and Asia
-
The working class worldwide:
-
Allowing itself to be programmed and brainwashed by the capitalist cabal
-
Allowing itself to degenerate to the status of brain-dead robots
-
Failing to inform itself as to the world situation
-
Failing to organize itself to overthrow the capitalist cabal
-
Failing to reorganize society so the means of production are owned by the
people and used for their essential needs
To prepare for revolutionary restructuring of our entire culture, it will
require thinking people throughout the world to re-educate themselves. They
must first realize what a debilitated, sub-human intellectual, social, and
spiritual state they are
now in and use this as incentive to inform and
organize themselves for non-violent revolutionary action.
Capitalists are so addicted to greed and violence that we can never expect
them to build a political-economic-social system for the common benefit of
all citizens.
On the contrary, capitalists will do everything possible to see that their
system of political tyranny and economic oppression continues.
This essay's
purpose is to help us realize that it's up to workers throughout the world
to begin now to prepare for extreme times, as predatory capitalists
deliberately cause collapse and ruin for the purpose of consolidating their
power in a new world order.
When new, demonic Nazi and Communist regimes were created in the twentieth
century, they engaged in hyperbolic savagery. The Nazis murdered 6 million
Jews and 22 million other Europeans.
The Soviet Communists exterminated 62
million and the Chinese Communists killed 35 million.
Our responsibility during this anarchic time of "fire in a nuthouse during a
flood" is to assist workers:
-
Become fully informed about the present world situation:
-
Educate themselves
-
Build a leadership organization 9
-
Build small cooperative communities through which to leaven the larger
society
-
At intervals, during efforts to overthrow
capitalism and build commonwealth
communities, engage in psychic antidote
measures:
"As nightfall does not come all at once, neither does oppression. In both
instances, there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged.
And it is in such a twilight that we all must be most aware of change in the
air - however slight - lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness."
Justice William O. Douglass

Holocaust: (Greek holókauston: holos, "completely" and

great destruction resulting in the extensive loss of life; the massive
destruction of human beings by other human beings

The present situation is incorrectly identified by some persons as a
"Black Swan," a completely accidental and unplanned event. See Nassim
Nicholas Taleb, The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable, 2007.
Taleb argues a Black Swan has three attributes. First, they lie outside
the realm of regular expectations; second, they promise an extreme
impact; and, third, in spite of its outlier status, human nature makes us
concoct explanations for its occurrence after the fact, making it
explainable and predictable.

Those not working are only counted as unemployed workers if they are
willing and able to work for pay, are currently available for work, and have
actively looked for work. There are other, more inclusive measures of
unemployment, however, ranging from U4 (U3 plus "discouraged workers," i.e.,
those who are qualified but have given up looking for work) to U6 (U4 plus
various classes of "marginally attached" workers who are able and willing to
work, but cannot find employment, as well as part-time workers who want to
work full-time but cannot because of economic conditions).

He won't cut U.S. aid to Israel, to the tune of $15 million a
day - encouraging the Zionists to murder Palestinians and steal Palestinian
land and gas fields - because the cabal is 100% pro-Israel.

"If the premises for revolution are present, that is, if a revolutionary
situation exists, if there is a class which is interested in revolution and
which constitutes a decisive force, but there is not a party, an
organization that can lead it, or if this party is weak, if it lacks a clear
plan, then the most favorable revolutionary situation can end in failure."
Trotsky, German Revolution
