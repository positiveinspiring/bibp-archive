Federal Bureau of Investigation
FBI Program -Carnivore
from Fringefolk:
Here is the name & some information on the government
search engine "Carnivore". Read how they do this. We need
to scream bloody murder. This is the one that the SS Agents said they
used to catch my email. And as you may remember jck said that her server
has been accessed by the government search engine. Why?
All she has on her web site are family photo albums. This is no laughing
matter. This should scare everyone who has an ounce of common sense.

Urge Congress to Stop the FBI's Use of Privacy-Invading Software In today's
electronic age, an invasion of privacy is only a point and click away. This
fact has become increasingly clear in recent months as Congress has begun
to ask questions about a new online wiretapping system that the FBI calls
"Carnivore." The system forces Internet service providers to attach a black
box to their networks - essentially a powerful computer running specialized
software - through which all of their subscribers' communications flow. In
traditional wiretaps, the government is required to minimize its interception
of non-incriminating - or innocent - communications. But Carnivore does just
the opposite by scanning through tens of millions of emails and other communications
from innocent Internet users as well as the targeted suspect.
It is as though the FBI suddenly believes it has the right and legal authority
to send agents into the Post Office to rip open each and every mailbag and
search for one person's letters. To use another analogy, Carnivore is like
the telephone company being forced to give the FBI access to all the calls
on its network when it only has permission to seek the calls for one subscriber.
Dozens of politicians from across the political spectrum have called on
Attorney General John Ashcroft to suspend the use of Carnivore until Congress
can determine its legality. Take action now to reinforce that message with
your Members of Congress.
The Latest Waco Fireball
by James Bovard
The Waco ghost may be rising from the grave once more to place its ice-cold
hand again on the neck of the Washington establishment. A new film and a
new book by top Waco experts achieve the miraculous -- further shredding
government credibility on the FBI's April 19, 1993 attack on the Branch Davidians.
Back in September 1999, Attorney General Janet Reno hand-picked establishment
eminence and former U.S. Senator John Danforth (R-MO) to put the wooden stake
in the heart of the Waco issue once and for all. Danforth, operating supposedly
as an independent counsel, did his pious best -- and raced to release his
report last summer just as rumor had it that he was a top prospect to be
Bush's vice presidential candidate. Danforth basically exonerated the feds,
saving his scorn for low-life Americans who dared criticize the government
tank assault and gassing of the women, children, and men in the Davidians'
home.
A key issue in Danforth's investigation was whether FBI agents fired on
Davidians during the final attack. Rhythmic patterns on Forward Looking Infrared
("FLIR") tapes made from an FBI plane strongly suggested automatic weapons
fire came from positions near the FBI tanks. Danforth persuaded federal Judge
Walter Smith to conduct a re-enactment last year of the final day's action.
Danforth then proclaimed that the film from the re-enactment proved beyond
a doubt that federal agents did not shoot at Davidians -- in large part because
the muzzle flashes on the re-enactment were much shorter than the shots from
the April 19, 1993 tape.
A new film, entitled "The F.L.I.R. Project," produced by Mike McNulty (one
of the masterminds behind the 1998 Academy Award finalist documentary, "Waco:
Rules of Engagement") reveals fatal flaws in Danforth's re-enactment. (The
film is available at http://www.flirproject.com)
On April 19, 1993, FBI agents relied on a commercial, off-the-shelf ammo
-- the type that would be used by any hunter or shooter. For the March 19,
2000 Danforth-FBI re-enactment, however, the FBI used military-issue ammunition
that had a special chemical coating on the gunpowder to reduce muzzle flash
(helpful in preventing soldiers being detected in combat). The military ammo
thus had a built-in flash suppressant.
Since a key issue was the length of the muzzle flashes, using flash-suppressing
ammunition ensured that the re-enactment would be a farce.
The Danforth-FBI re-enactment further biased the test results by having
the FBI agents use weapons with a 20-inch barrel -- instead of weapons with
14-inch barrels which agents carried on April 19, 1993. The longer a weapon's
barrel, the less muzzle flash will be shown from each shot.
Again, this is a tricky way to do an accurate re-enactment. But the re-enactment
produced the result that Reno and Danforth sought -- and Danforth proceeded
to denounce the American people for thinking bad things about their federal
masters.
No doubt Danforth, the FBI, and others will continue to insist that there
was no gunfire by FBI agents on April 19, 1993. But if the feds are innocent,
why have they gone to such absurd lengths to fix the jury? The $12 million
in tax dollars that Danforth spent for his Waco investigation should have
been categorized as part of the public relations budget of the FBI and Justice
Department -- or perhaps as a line item expense in the Clinton Legacy Project.
These revelations come on top of information that has already surfaced showing
the Danforth investigation to be a sham. Danforth personally chose Vector
Data Systems to carry out the tests, with U.S. military assistance, and to
evaluate the results. Danforth repeatedly identified Vector as independent
British company. But Vector is actually owned by Anteon, a large American
corporation that on its webpage boasts of contracts with 50 federal agencies,
including the White House Communications Agency.
A new book by former federal attorney David Hardy further batters the government's
Waco fairy tale. This Is Not An Assault provides fascinating inside
details on how private investigators squeezed out damning information on
Waco -- how federal judge Walter Smith stifled lawyers at the trial last
year to prevent jurors from learning of over a hundred items of evidence
embarrassing to, or potentially incriminating, the federal government --
and how Republican congressmen (such as Dan Burton) and aides cowered and
effectively aided the Clinton administration cover-up. Hardy's skill in hammering
federal agencies with Freedom of Information Act requests was a decisive
factor in making Waco a hot political potato in 1999. (Hardy's book will
be soon available at http://http://www.Xlibris.com)
If President Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft want to restore the
faith of the American people in the federal government, they must open the
vaults on Waco. The cover-up continues -- almost eight years after the final
fire of Waco. Neither Bush nor Ashcroft should have any incentive to cover
up the outrages of Reno and other Clinton administration officials. On the
other hand, if Bush and Ashcroft do not have the will or gumption to force
the FBI, the ATF, and the Justice Department to come clean about Clinton
era abuses, what hope can we have of their honesty regarding any abuses occurring
after January 20?

FBI Visits Activists Searching for BLA
Soldier
by Ernesto Aguilar
Over the last year, several activists with the Anarchist Black Cross Federation
have received visits from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
The most recent of these occurred in late February, 2001, in Jacksonville,Florida,
when the landlord of ABCF activists was questioned by FBI operatives.
The FBI is in the middle of a manhunt for Black Liberation Army combatant
Azikikwe Onipedo, accused of shooting at a police officer in Neptune, New
Jersey. The Anarchist Black Cross Federation, in building its support
and freedom programs for Political Prisoners and Prisoners of War, dialogues
and works actively with many former Black Panthers and BLA
soldiers. We also visit many of these prisoners, and involve them in work.
It's presumed that this activity is what has drawn FBI harassment and surveillance.
These sorts of FBI activities should be exposed by all revolutionaries,
and
all should be aware.

Group: Opus Dei / Work of God
File Name:
od.txt
Last Updated:
6/89
Principals:
Msgr. Alvaro del Portillo (Prelate).(1)
Category: Religious
Background:
Opus Dei ("Work of God") was founded in 1928 by a young Spanish
priest named Josemaria
Escriva de Balaguer in response to a divine command.(2)
He founded this Catholic lay organization to "tell men and women of every country and of every condition, race, language, milieu, and state of life...that they can love and serve God without giving up their ordinary work, their family life, and their normal social relations."(1) Opus Dei displays features of a cult, however, including worship of the founder--known as the "Father"--and self-mortification by its followers.(3) Josemaria Escriva wrote his most famous book, called "The Way," a compendium of 999 "maxims" that became Opus Dei's spiritual handbook.(3) He also saw himself as a latter-day knight, leading the faithful into battle against godless communism.(3) Msgr. Escriva, whom Pope John Paul II called "an unforgettable figure," died in 1975.(1)
In 1981, a beatification process was begun in Rome.(4) Msgr. Alvaro del
Portillo, who had spent 40 years as Msgr. Escriva's chief aide, was named
the first Prelate of Opus Dei in1982.(1,3,4)
Ascetism, anticommunism, a rigid hierarchicalism, religious militancy and
secrecy have become the distinguishing marks of the organization.(3)
Opus Dei has followed a deliberate policy of keeping its membership, hierarchy,
rituals and rules hidden.(3) In an interview for the Catholic diosesan newspaper,
the Brooklyn Tablet, Fr. Angel de la Parte Paris observed that Opus Dei professes
a fundamentalist theology, condemns Liberation Theology, has no concern for
social problems, leaves little freedom to an individual's conscience, and
is associated with secular power structures.(5)
Opus Dei finds a strong supporter in Pope John Paul II. Barry James, in
an article published in the Los Angeles Times, says that the Pope is "giving
clear indications of his esteem for the conservative Opus Dei as a
force that could regenerate lax moral values in the West and stand
as a bulwark against communism."(2) The Pope has also taken part in the ordination
of an Opus Dei priest.(1,2)
In 1982, Opus Dei received the status of personal prelature by decision
of Pope John Paul II. The personal prelature status means that the organization
is more autonomous, more flexible, and answers directly to the Pope through
Msgr. Alvaro Portillo rather than through a bishop.(1) According to Penny
Lernoux, The Nation's Latin American correspondent, Opus Dei forms
part of a powerful group of Catholic organizations of U.S. origin that promote
the Pope's political agenda.(6)
Opus Dei has a hierarchical organization. Numeraries--a select group of
people who belong to the middle or upper classes--hold a university degree,
must be unmarried, and must pledge vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.
Below the numeraries are the associates, who have the same obligations as
the numeraries, but come from the working class. A final category consists
of "co-operators," or sympathizers, who can be Catholics or non-Catholic.
This class division is rigorously enforced.(3)
To join Opus Dei, according to Msgr. Alvaro del Portillo, it is necessary
that" each person must have received from God the specific vocation to dedicate
himself (herself) to the specific aims of Opus Dei, and must meet the requirements
necessary to undertake responsibly the commitments involved in that
dedication."(4)
Membership with Opus Dei requires a contract which spells out the rights and the obligations which the members assume.(1) Opus Dei has some 73,000 members in eighty-seven countries, the largest number being in Spain and Latin America. It also influences 487 universities and high schools, 52 radio and television stations, 694 publications, 38 news and publicity agencies, and 12 film distribution companies.(3)
The group has received criticism for being connected to powerful institutions
and for entering the field of education for the middle and upper classes.(2)
Critic John Roche, a professor at Oxford University, has said, "I am convinced
Opus Dei is a sect, a cult, a malignant growth upon the body of the church."(2)
Countries: Members in 80 countries, including: Argentina, American Samoa,
Australia, Belgium, BN, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador,
Estonia, France, Georgia, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Honduras, Indonesia, Italy,
Ivory Coast, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Perú, Philippines, Portugal,
PU, Spain, Singapore, Swaziland, Uganda, United States, Venezuela, and
South Africa.(1,7)
Funding: Funding comes from the tithing practice and voluntary donations
of its members. "Co-operators" also donate to Opus Dei.(1,3,7)
Activities: According to Opus Dei, its main purpose is the general mobilization
of Catholic lay men and women with the aim of making them clearly aware of
their rights and responsibility in fulfilling their duties as consistent
Catholics.(4) This religious task is carried out by Opus Dei members taking part in all human activities:
social, cultural, and scientific.(4) In their professional and familiar
surroundings, members carry out a constant personal apostolate on a one-to-one
basis with those around them.(4)
Opus Dei works with worker groups in Spain, Argentina, Colombia, and Brazil;
with youth clubs in Kenya, Nigeria, Japan, Puerto Rico, England, Canada,
Australia, Portugal, Mexico, Belgium, Ecuador, Kenya, and Spain; with students in Costa Rica, Australia,
Austria, Spain, the United States, England, Nigeria, Belgium, Uruguay,
Philippines, Italy, Venezuela, Chile, Colombia, Canada, Ecuador, and Switzerland;
with universities in Spain, Peru, and Colombia; and with women's study centers
such as the Escuela Tecnica de Hosteleria y Hogar Montemira in El Salvador,
and others in Mexico, France, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Spain, Philippines, Peru, Brazil, United States, England, Argentina,
and Italy.(7)
Spain: Opus Dei has its main base in Spain, where it has raised the largest
contributions and enjoyed the most substantial political and economic influence.
Opus Dei retained a strong influence on Spain's banking system and industry.(3) The Spanish
branch has the largestmembership (24,000, some 5,000 of whom are numeraries),
the biggest network of centers and schools, including Pamplona's University,
and a business school in Barcelona with ties to Harvard University. Opus
Dei members claim to control more than 150 companies and financial entities
known as the "Holy Octopus."(3)
Critics allege that Opus Dei served the Franco dictatorship and works
through right-wing parties in Spain.(2,3)
El Salvador: It entered in El Salvador in 1958. In 1985, the Catholic church
appointed two non-native bishops. One of them, Fr. Fernando Saenz, is a member
of Opus Dei. According to the Salvadoran Jesuit magazine, Estudios Centroamericanos,
these appointments showed the Vatican's determination to control socially activist
sectors in the church.(3,6) Opus Dei supports right-wing political groups in the
country through its religious courses and schools, and through newspapers,
magazines, and television outlets influenced or owned by members in El Salvador.(3,6)
Guatemala: Opus Dei runs a dormitory for male students who attend a university
but receive additional education through the group. Opus Dei holds
seminars "to change attitudes" of workers of all religions in Guatemala.(8)
They also have programs for women and business owners and run a worker center
called "el Centro de Formacion y Capacitacion Obrera Kinal."(8)
United States: U.S. membership remains small, at approximately 3,000. The
U.S. branch was founded in Chicago by a Spanish priest in 1949. Opus Dei
has established several student centers in Chicago, New York City, Milwaukee,
San Francisco, Indiana, and Washington D.C.(3) A priest from the American Catholic church said that
Opus Dei is a "devious, antidemocratic, reactionary, semi-fascist institution, desperately
hungry for absolute power in the church. It ought to be forced either to
come out into the open or be suppressed."(3)
Private Connections: Opus Dei is inseparably linked to the priestly Order
of the Holy Cross, whose President General is the Prelate of Opus Dei.(4)
