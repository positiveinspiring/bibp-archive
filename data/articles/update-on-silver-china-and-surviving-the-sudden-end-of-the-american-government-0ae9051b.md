Louise Yamada, one of the most respected Wall Street analysts, is very close
to telling her clients to pull the trigger on the NYSE.
Small investors and mutual funds are pulling out
leaving only High Frequency algorithmic computerized traders and the Plunge
Protection Team to buy stocks. There are no real human beings left in the
markets.
There have been repeated rumors that
Morgan Stanley is near bankruptcy and is soon to be gobbled up by
JP Morgan.
Jamie Dimon has admitted that if his bank
were taken over there is another 150 billion dollars in bad assets to get
rid of. That means that even after 30 trillion dollars in Bailouts that all
of the big banks are bankrupt.
Jim Willie has warned us that because of Glass Steagalls repeal Morgan
Stanley now owns Dean Witter and Smith Barney making them Americas largest
broker with 300,000 brokerage accounts and over 17,500 brokers.
In the Sentinel case the courts ruled that
depositors whose money had been stolen by their broker could not sue the
bank where the money was sent because Sentinel had not intended to steal
their money. In the MF Global case 1.2 billion dollars vaporized and none of
the money was returned.
Sibel Edmonds told us that when the FBI
did background checks on judicial nominees that honest men and women were
turned down and felons were put to the top of the list.
That is why we cannot expect justice from
their courts.
The Gauss computer virus which is similar to the
CIA-Mossad Stuxnet computer virus attacks
banks is thought to steal money from your account and send it to an account
in another and unknown bank. Computer viruses have been attacking European
banks and stealing money. This has made it impossible for depositors to have
access to their money which is what used to be called a Bank Holiday.
Jim Willie has told us all that it is time to
get
away from Morgan Stanley and any brokerage associated with
them. If you do have silver and gold mining shares you need to demand the
physical shares be delivered to you so your brokerage cannot use them to
short stocks thus driving down their value and exposing you to the risk of
loss if they go bankrupt in the market.
People need to understand how serious the bank runs are in Spain.
Zero Hedge reported that the amount of
money withdrawn from the banks in Spain to date is nearly half of their GDP.
The U.S. money supply is 10 trillion and the GDP is nearly 15 trillion, If 4
trillion dollars left America, we would go into an immediate collapse
probably worse than 1929-39.
You need money to conduct business. I recently
wrote about two IMF economists who admitted that most of our problems were
created by fractional reserve banking and bank runs would be eliminated if
we did away with it.
Spain cannot survive much longer and will not make it until our November
elections unless Bernanke creates trillions of dollars and dumps them on,
-
Spain
-
France
-
Italy
-
Greece
-
Portugal
-
Ireland,
-
Belgium,
...and points east...
I previously wrote that Ben Bernanke has
been ordered by men in London and New York who are higher up on the banking
food chain to hurt Obamas re-election as much as possible. The idea is to
not print enough money to create jobs until after the voting returns are
announced on November 6th.
I believe Obama was made President because he is
black and it is his job to start nationwide race and food riots to take our
focus away from the bankers who have stolen tens of trillions of dollars
from whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Indians.
A possible scenario is that there is another shock
like
the October 2008 crisis.
This time with a collapse of Morgan Stanley or
the complete implosion of Greece and Spain sending waves of panic through
the voters to stampede them into voting for Romney. I am voting for
neither Romney nor Obama.
There was a little noted trade agreement made between China and Germany
which allowed for direct exchange in Yuan and German Euros.
This has followed similar agreements between
China and,
-
Russia
-
Brazil
-
Japan
-
Africa
Since the Beijing Conference of 2010 China has
invested 100 billion dollars in Africa.
This had prompted
Hillary Clinton to go
to Africa and warn them about Chinese people building roads, bridges,
hospitals and other such obvious colonial projects. She had no money just
words.
America is being set up for the exact opposite of what is happening in
Spain. As I have said many times in the past, the North American Free Trade
Act sent 56,000 manufacturing plants and 12 million jobs overseas.
President
Clinton allowed China to devalue the Yuan and destroy the American economy.
He guaranteed that Americans would be sent into abject poverty when he
allowed the repeal of the
Glass Steagall Act which prevented
commercial banks from making risky bets with depositors money.
Clinton also allowed the banks into the faux
insurance business when he did not let Brooksley Born (Chairwoman of
the Commodities Future Trading Commission) to regulate Credit Default Swaps.
CDS pretend to insure speculators on potential
losses in the value of bonds and commodities. U.S. banks are exposed to 225
trillion dollars in potential losses with no money set aside to pay claims
other than your pension and life savings.
I would expect an economic shock within the next 6 weeks, to be followed by
Hyperinflation after the elections. I have previously defined Hyperinflation
as starting at 25% for an international reserve currency like the dollar.
Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker was able to defend the dollar in
1980 when he raised home mortgages up to 15Â½ %.
But that was before NAFTA, CDS and too many wars
for Israel had deteriorated the dollar and the economy.
As I said, America will soon have the reverse of
Spains outflow of dollars. When Hyperinflation takes off, an International
Conference like Bretton Woods will be called. The dollar will be dumped and
devalued by at least 40%.
Prior to the conference Insiders will dump
dollars by the trillions instantly impoverishing another 100 million
Americans. Since most dollars are held overseas by foreigners, the domestic
American money supply will double impoverishing another 80 million people. I
recently wrote that 280 million Americans will be at or near the poverty
line at some point in 2013. Hyperinflation will do that to you.
By design we will have nationwide food riots and race riots. American cities
will become uninhabitable. We will have martial law. There is no choice
about that. That is the future the bankers have designed for you. In their
plans you will be taken to a
FEMA camp where industrial size
incinerators will dispose of tens of thousands of troublemakers talking
about the Bill of Rights.
The only other alternative is to have the police
and the military administer martial law in our favor and arrest the bankers
so we can reform the economy.
Your job is to figure out how to survive the next year. You will need a
store of food and a water filter. Under martial law the authorities will cut
off your food and water so you will get on the bus to Camp FEMA.
If the cities are No Go Zones, you will need a
place to go where you and your friends in your network will wait things out.
If there is a Bank Holiday, you will need cash in your hand so store some in
a safe place. Computer credits in a closed bank will do you no good
Silver Doctors recently had to purchase a million ounces for their
customers.
They encountered a lot of resistance as did
Eric Sprott before him. We have been told silver production is down 14%
in the U.S. this year. A lot of silver is mined with copper which is in over
abundance as China has too many stockpiles.
Another reason is the the U.S. Geological Survey
says silver will become an extinct medal in 10 years. We have been melting
down silver coins minted before 1965. Silver should go up in value soon as
there is only a billion ounces in circulation and is valued at 32 billion
dollars. The dollar value of silver and gold bullion bought by investors is
equal for the two metals yet gold is priced 50 times or more what silvers
price is.
The ability of the government to manipulate
prices is lessened each day by the diminishing supply of silver and the
approaching collapse of the dollar. I would expect silver to double in price
long before gold does.
There are 10,000 Hedge Funds in what has been called the
Shadow Banking
System.
One Hedge Fund could short Morgan Stanley stock
to zero and invest its profits in silver bullion. Pre-1964 silver coins are
a great store of value which is one function of money. After the economy
collapses silver coins will be an ideal medium of exchange because everyone
knows what they are and what they are worth.
Soon the major concern of your life will be surviving to the end of 2013.
