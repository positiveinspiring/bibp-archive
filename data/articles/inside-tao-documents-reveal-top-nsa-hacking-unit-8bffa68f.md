The NSA's TAO hacking unit
is considered to be the intelligence agency's
top secret weapon.
It maintains its own covert network,
infiltrates computers around the world
and even intercepts shipping deliveries
to plant back doors in electronics
ordered by those it is targeting.
This National Security Agency
complex in San Antonio, Texas,
located in a former Sony chip
factory,
is one of the central offices
of the intelligence agency's
Tailored Access Operations,
the NSA's top operative unit.
It's something like a squad
of plumbers that can be called in
when normal access to a
target is blocked.

The documents seen by SPIEGEL
indicate
the NSA's desire to "subvert
endpoint devices".
According to the documents,
one trail also leads to Germany.
According to a document
dating from 2010 that lists
the "Lead TAO Liaisons"
domestically and abroad as well as
names, email addresses and
the number for their "Secure Phone,"
a liaison office is located
near Frankfurt - the European Security Operations Center (ESOC)
at the so-called "Dagger
Complex" at a US military compound
in the Griesheim suburb of
Darmstadt.
Part 1
Documents Reveal Top NSA Hacking Unit
In January 2010, numerous homeowners in San
Antonio, Texas, stood baffled in front of their closed garage doors.
They wanted to drive to work or head off to do
their grocery shopping, but their garage door openers had gone dead, leaving
them stranded. No matter how many times they pressed the buttons, the doors
didn't budge.
The problem primarily affected residents in the
western part of the city, around Military Drive and the interstate highway
known as Loop 410.
In the United States, a country of cars and
commuters, the mysterious garage door problem quickly became an issue for
local politicians. Ultimately, the municipal government solved the riddle.
Fault for the error lay with the United States' foreign intelligence
service, the National Security Agency, which has offices in San Antonio.
Officials at the agency were forced to admit
that one of the NSA's radio antennas was broadcasting at the same frequency
as the garage door openers. Embarrassed officials at the intelligence agency
promised to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, and soon the doors
began opening again.
It was thanks to the garage door opener episode
that Texans learned just how far the NSA's work had encroached upon their
daily lives.
For quite some time now, the intelligence agency
has maintained a branch with around 2,000 employees at Lackland Air Force
Base, also in San Antonio. In 2005, the agency took over a former Sony
computer chip plant in the western part of the city. A brisk pace of
construction commenced inside this enormous compound.
The acquisition of the former chip factory at
Sony Place was part of a massive expansion the agency began after the events
of Sept. 11, 2001.
On-Call Digital Plumbers
One of the two main buildings at the former
plant has since housed a sophisticated NSA unit, one that has benefited the
most from this expansion and has grown the fastest in recent years - the
Office of Tailored Access Operations, or
TAO.
This is the NSA's top operative unit - something
like a squad of plumbers that can be called in when normal access to a
target is blocked.
According to internal NSA documents viewed by
SPIEGEL, these on-call digital plumbers are involved in many sensitive
operations conducted by American intelligence agencies. TAO's area of
operations ranges from counterterrorism to cyber attacks to traditional
espionage.
The documents reveal just how diversified the
tools at TAO's disposal have become - and also how it exploits the technical
weaknesses of the IT industry, from Microsoft to Cisco and Huawei, to carry
out its discreet and efficient attacks.
The unit is,
"akin to the wunderkind of the US
intelligence community," says Matthew Aid, a historian who specializes
in the history of the NSA.
"Getting the ungettable" is the NSA's own
description of its duties.
"It is not about the quantity produced but
the quality of intelligence that is important," one former TAO chief
wrote, describing her work in a document.
The paper seen by SPIEGEL quotes the former unit
head stating that TAO has contributed,
"some of the most significant intelligence
our country has ever seen."
The unit, it goes on, has "access to our very
hardest targets."
A Unit Born of the Internet
Defining the future of her unit at the time, she
wrote that TAO,
"needs to continue to grow and must lay the
foundation for integrated Computer Network Operations," and that it must
"support Computer Network Attacks as an integrated part of military
operations."
To succeed in this, she wrote, TAO would have to
acquire,
"pervasive, persistent access on the global
network."
An internal description of TAO's
responsibilities makes clear that aggressive attacks are an explicit part of
the unit's tasks.
In other words, the NSA's hackers have been
given a government mandate for their work. During the middle part of the
last decade, the special unit succeeded in gaining access to 258 targets in
89 countries - nearly everywhere in the world.
In 2010, it conducted 279 operations worldwide.
Indeed, TAO specialists have directly accessed
the protected networks of
democratically elected leaders of countries. They infiltrated networks
of European telecommunications companies and gained access to and read mails
sent over Blackberry's BES email servers, which until then were believed to
be securely encrypted.
Achieving this last goal required a "sustained
TAO operation," one document states.
This TAO unit is born of the Internet - created
in 1997, a time when not even 2 percent of the world's population had
Internet access and no one had yet thought of,
From the time the first TAO employees moved into
offices at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, the unit was housed in
a separate wing, set apart from the rest of the agency.
Their task was clear from the beginning: to
work around the clock to find ways to hack into global communications
traffic.
Recruiting the Geeks
To do this, the NSA needed a new kind of
employee.
The TAO workers authorized to access the
special, secure floor on which the unit is located are for the most part
considerably younger than the average NSA staff member. Their job is
breaking into, manipulating and exploiting computer networks, making them
hackers and civil servants in one. Many resemble geeks - and act the part,
too.
Indeed, it is from these very circles that the
NSA recruits new hires for its Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit.
In recent years, NSA Director Keith Alexander
has made several appearances at major hacker conferences in the United
States. Sometimes, Alexander wears his military uniform, but at others, he
even dons jeans and a t-shirt in his effort to court trust and a new
generation of employees.
The recruitment strategy seems to have borne
fruit. Certainly, few if any other divisions within the agency are growing
as quickly as TAO.
There are now TAO units in,
-
Wahiawa, Hawaii
-
Fort Gordon, Georgia
-
at the NSA's outpost at Buckley Air
Force Base, near Denver, Colorado
-
at its headquarters in Fort Meade
-
and, of course, in San Antonio
One trail also leads to Germany.
According to a document dating from 2010 that
lists the "Lead TAO Liaisons" domestically and abroad as well as names,
email addresses and the number for their "Secure Phone," a liaison office is
located near Frankfurt - the European Security Operations Center (ESOC)
at the so-called "Dagger
Complex" at a US military compound in the Griesheim suburb of Darmstadt.
But it is the growth of the unit's Texas branch
that has been uniquely impressive, the top secret documents reviewed by
SPIEGEL show. These documents reveal that in 2008, the Texas Cryptologic
Center employed fewer than 60 TAO specialists.
By 2015, the number is projected to grow to 270
employees. In addition, there are another 85 specialists in the
"Requirements & Targeting" division (up from 13 specialists in 2008). The
number of software developers is expected to increase from the 2008 level of
three to 38 in 2015.

Part 2
Targeting Mexico
Mexico's Secretariat of Public Security, which
was folded into the new National Security Commission at the beginning of
2013, was responsible at the time for the country's police,
counterterrorism, prison system and border police.
Most of the agency's nearly 20,000 employees
worked at its headquarters on Avenida Constituyentes, an important traffic
artery in Mexico City.
A large share of the Mexican security
authorities under the auspices of the Secretariat are supervised from the
offices there, making Avenida Constituyentes a one-stop shop for anyone
seeking to learn more about the country's security apparatus.
Operation WHITETAMALE
That considered, assigning the TAO unit
responsible for tailored operations to target the Secretariat makes a lot of
sense.
After all, one document states, the US
Department of Homeland Security and the United States' intelligence agencies
have a need to know everything about the drug trade, human trafficking and
security along the US-Mexico border. The Secretariat presents a potential
"goldmine" for the NSA's spies, a document states.
The TAO workers selected systems administrators
and telecommunications engineers at the Mexican agency as their targets,
thus marking the start of what the unit dubbed Operation WHITETAMALE.
Just how intensively the US spies on its
neighbors can be seen in another, previously unknown operation in
Mexico, dubbed "Whitetamale" by the NSA.
In August 2009, according to internal
documents, the agency gained access to the emails of various
high-ranking officials in Mexico's Public Security Secretariat that
combats the drug trade and human trafficking.
This hacking operation allowed the NSA not
only to obtain information on several drug cartels, but also to gain
access to "diplomatic talking-points."
In the space of a single year, according to
the internal documents, this operation produced 260 classified reports
that allowed US politicians to conduct successful talks on political
issues and to plan international investments.

Workers at NSA's target selection office, which
also had Angela Merkel in its sights in 2002 before she became
chancellor, sent TAO a list of officials within the Mexican Secretariat they
thought might make interesting targets.
As a first step, TAO penetrated the target
officials' email accounts, a relatively simple job. Next, they infiltrated
the entire network and began capturing data.
Soon the NSA spies had knowledge of the agency's
servers, including IP addresses, computers used for email traffic and
individual addresses of diverse employees. They also obtained diagrams of
the security agencies' structures, including video surveillance.
It appears the operation continued for years
until SPIEGEL
first reported on it in October.
The technical term for this type of activity is
"Computer Network Exploitation" (CNE). The goal here is to "subvert endpoint
devices," according to an internal NSA presentation that SPIEGEL has viewed.
The presentation goes on to list nearly all the
types of devices that run our digital lives,
"servers, workstations, firewalls, routers,
handsets, phone switches,
SCADA systems, etc."
SCADAs are industrial control systems used in
factories, as well as in power plants. Anyone who can bring these systems
under their control has the potential to knock out parts of a country's
critical infrastructure.
The most well-known and notorious use of this
type of attack was the development of Stuxnet, the computer worm whose
existence was discovered in June 2010.
The virus was developed jointly by American and
Israeli intelligence agencies to sabotage Iran's nuclear program, and
successfully so.
The country's nuclear program was set back by years after
Stuxnet
manipulated the SCADA control technology used at Iran's uranium enrichment
facilities in Natanz, rendering up to 1,000 centrifuges unusable.
The special NSA unit has its own development
department in which new technologies are developed and tested.
This division is where the real tinkerers can be
found, and their inventiveness when it comes to finding ways to infiltrate
other networks, computers and smartphones evokes a modern take on Q, the
legendary gadget inventor in James Bond movies.
Having Fun at Microsoft's
Expense
One example of the sheer creativity with which
the TAO spies approach their work can be seen in a hacking method they use
that exploits the error-proneness of
Microsoft's Windows.
Every user of the operating system is familiar
with the annoying window that occasionally pops up on screen when an
internal problem is detected, an automatic message that prompts the user to
report the bug to the manufacturer and to restart the program.
These crash reports offer TAO specialists a
welcome opportunity to spy on computers.
The original Microsoft error
message exploited by the NSA
When TAO selects a computer somewhere in the
world as a target and enters its unique identifiers (an IP address, for
example) into the corresponding database, intelligence agents are then
automatically notified any time the operating system of that computer
crashes and its user receives the prompt to report the problem to Microsoft.
An internal presentation suggests it is NSA's
powerful
XKeyscore spying tool that is used to fish these crash reports out of
the massive sea of Internet traffic.
The automated crash reports are a "neat way" to
gain "passive access" to a machine, the presentation continues. Passive
access means that, initially, only data the computer sends out into the
Internet is captured and saved, but the computer itself is not yet
manipulated.
Still, even this passive access to error
messages provides valuable insights into problems with a targeted person's
computer and, thus, information on security holes that might be exploitable
for planting malware or spyware on the unwitting victim's computer.
Although the method appears to have little
importance in practical terms, the NSA's agents still seem to enjoy it
because it allows them to have a bit of a laugh at the expense of the
Seattle-based software giant.
In one internal graphic, they replaced the text
of Microsoft's original error message with one of their own reading,
"This information may be intercepted by a
foreign sigint system to gather detailed information and better exploit
your machine." ("Sigint" stands for "signals intelligence.")
An NSA internal slide:
"This information may be
intercepted by a foreign SIGINT system
to gather detailed
information and better exploit your machine."
One of the hackers' key tasks is the offensive
infiltration of target computers with so-called implants or with large
numbers of Trojans.
They've bestowed their spying tools with
illustrious monikers like "ANGRY NEIGHBOR," "HOWLERMONKEY" or "WATERWITCH."
These names may sound cute, but the tools they describe are both aggressive
and effective.
According to details in Washington's current
budget plan for the US intelligence services, around 85,000 computers
worldwide are projected to be
infiltrated by the NSA specialists by the
end of this year.
By far the majority of these "implants" are
conducted by TAO teams via the Internet.
Increasing Sophistication
Until just a few years ago, NSA agents relied on
the same methods employed by cyber criminals to conduct these implants on
computers.
They sent targeted attack emails disguised as
spam containing links directing users to virus-infected websites. With
sufficient knowledge of an Internet browser's security holes - Microsoft's
Internet Explorer, for example, is especially popular with the NSA hackers -
all that is needed to plant NSA malware on a person's computer is for that
individual to open a website that has been specially crafted to compromise
the user's computer.
Spamming has one key drawback though: It doesn't
work very often.
Nevertheless, TAO has dramatically improved the
tools at its disposal. It maintains a sophisticated toolbox known internally
by the name "QUANTUMTHEORY."
"Certain QUANTUM missions have a success
rate of as high as 80%, where spam is less than 1%," one internal NSA
presentation states.
A comprehensive internal presentation titled
"QUANTUM CAPABILITIES," which SPIEGEL has viewed, lists virtually every
popular Internet service provider as a target, including Facebook, Yahoo,
Twitter and YouTube.
"NSA QUANTUM has the greatest success
against Yahoo, Facebook and static IP addresses," it states.
The presentation also notes that the NSA has
been unable to employ this method to target
users of Google services. Apparently, that can only be done by
Britain's GCHQ intelligence service, which has acquired QUANTUM tools from
the NSA.
A favored tool of intelligence service hackers
is "QUANTUMINSERT."
GCHQ workers used this method to
attack the computers of employees at partly
government-held Belgian telecommunications company Belgacom, in order to use
their computers to penetrate even further into the company's networks.
The NSA, meanwhile, used the same technology to
target high-ranking members of the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at the organization's Vienna
headquarters.
In both cases, the trans-Atlantic spying
consortium gained unhindered access to valuable economic data using these
tools.
Part 3
The NSA's Shadow Network
The insert method and other variants of
QUANTUM are closely linked to a shadow network operated by the NSA
alongside the Internet, with its own, well-hidden infrastructure
comprised of "covert" routers and servers.
It appears the NSA also incorporates routers
and servers from non-NSA networks into its covert network by infecting
these networks with "implants" that then allow the government hackers to
control the computers remotely (read a
related article on the NSA's "implants".)
In this way, the intelligence service seeks
to identify and track its targets based on their digital footprints.
These identifiers could include certain email addresses or website
cookies set on a person's computer.
Of course, a cookie doesn't automatically
identify a person, but it can if it includes additional information like
an email address. In that case, a cookie becomes something like the web
equivalent of a fingerprint.
A Race Between Servers
Once TAO teams have gathered sufficient data
on their targets' habits, they can shift into attack mode, programming
the QUANTUM systems to perform this work in a largely automated way.
If a data packet featuring the email address
or cookie of a target passes through a cable or router monitored by the
NSA, the system sounds the alarm. It determines what website the target
person is trying to access and then activates one of the intelligence
service's covert servers, known by the codename FOXACID.
This NSA server coerces the user into
connecting to NSA covert systems rather than the intended sites.
In the case of Belgacom engineers, instead
of reaching the LinkedIn page they were actually trying to visit, they
were also directed to FOXACID servers housed on NSA networks. Undetected
by the user, the manipulated page transferred malware already custom
tailored to match security holes on the target person's computer.
The technique can literally be a race
between servers, one that is described in internal intelligence agency
jargon with phrases like:
"Wait for client to initiate new
connection," "Shoot!" and "Hope to beat
server-to-client response."
Like any competition, at times the covert
network's surveillance tools are "too slow to win the race."
Often enough, though, they are effective.
Implants with QUANTUMINSERT, especially when used in conjunction with
LinkedIn, now have a success rate of over 50 percent, according to one
internal document.
Tapping Undersea Cables
At the same time, it is in no way true to
say that the NSA has its sights set exclusively on select individuals.
Of even greater interest are entire networks
and network providers, such as the fiber optic cables that direct a
large share of global Internet traffic along the world's ocean floors.
One document labeled "top secret" and "not
for foreigners" describes the NSA's success in spying on the
"SEA-ME-WE-4" cable system. This massive underwater cable bundle
connects Europe with North Africa and the Gulf states and then continues
on through Pakistan and India, all the way to Malaysia and Thailand.
The cable system originates in southern
France, near Marseille. Among the companies that hold ownership stakes
in it are France Telecom, now known as Orange and still partly
government-owned, and Telecom Italia Sparkle.
The document proudly announces that, on Feb.
13, 2013, TAO,
"successfully collected network
management information for the SEA-Me-We Undersea Cable Systems
(SMW-4)."
With the help of a,
"website masquerade operation," the
agency was able to "gain access to the consortium's management
website and collected Layer 2 network information that shows the
circuit mapping for significant portions of the network."
It appears the government hackers succeeded
here once again using the QUANTUMINSERT method.
The document states that the TAO team hacked
an internal website of the operator consortium and copied documents
stored there pertaining to technical infrastructure.
But that was only the first step.
"More operations are planned in the
future to collect more information about this and other cable
systems," it continues.
But numerous internal announcements of
successful attacks like the one against the undersea cable operator
aren't the exclusive factors that make TAO stand out at the NSA.
In contrast to most NSA operations, TAO's
ventures often require physical access to their targets. After all, you
might have to directly access a mobile network transmission station
before you can begin tapping the digital information it provides.
Spying Traditions Live On
To conduct those types of operations, the
NSA works together with other intelligence agencies such as the CIA and
FBI, which in turn maintain informants on location who are available to
help with sensitive missions.
This enables TAO to attack even isolated
networks that aren't connected to the Internet. If necessary, the FBI
can even make an agency-owned jet available to ferry the high-tech
plumbers to their target.
This gets them to their destination at the
right time and can help them to disappear again undetected after as
little as a half hour's work.
Responding to a query from SPIEGEL, NSA
officials issued a statement saying,
"Tailored Access Operations is a unique
national asset that is on the front lines of enabling NSA to defend
the nation and its allies."
The statement added that TAO's,
"work is centered on computer network
exploitation in support of foreign intelligence collection."
The officials said they would not discuss
specific allegations regarding TAO's mission.
Sometimes it appears that the world's most
modern spies are just as reliant on conventional methods of
reconnaissance as their predecessors.
Take, for example, when they intercept
shipping deliveries. If a target person, agency or company orders a new
computer or related accessories, for example, TAO can divert the
shipping delivery to its own secret workshops. The NSA calls this method
interdiction.
At these so-called "load stations," agents
carefully open the package in order to load malware onto the
electronics, or even install hardware components that can provide
backdoor access for the intelligence agencies.
All subsequent steps can then be conducted
from the comfort of a remote computer.
These minor disruptions in the parcel
shipping business rank among the "most productive operations" conducted
by the NSA hackers, one top secret document relates in enthusiastic
terms. This method, the presentation continues, allows TAO to obtain
access to networks "around the world."
Even in the Internet Age, some traditional
spying methods continue to live on.
