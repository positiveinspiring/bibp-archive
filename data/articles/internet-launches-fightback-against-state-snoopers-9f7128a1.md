"Not having encryption on
the web today is a matter of life and death," is how one
member of the Internet Engineering Task Force - IETF
(the so-called architects of the web) described the
current situation.
As the FT reports, the IETF
have started to fight back against US and UK snooping
programs by drawing up an ambitious plan to defend
traffic over the world wide web against mass
surveillance.
The proposal is a system in
which all communication between websites and browsers
would be shielded by encryption.
While the plan is at an
early stage, it has the potential to transform a large
part of the internet and make it more difficult for
governments, companies and criminals to eavesdrop on
people as they browse the web.
"There has been a complete
change in how people perceive the world," since Snowden
exposed the NSA's massive surveillance efforts, and
while "not a silver bullet," the chief technologist at
security firm RSA notes, "anything that
improves trust
in this digital world is a noble aim."

Key architects of the internet have started to
fight back against
US and UK snooping programs by drawing up an ambitious plan to defend
traffic over the world wide web against mass surveillance.
The
Internet Engineering Task Force, a body that develops internet
standards, has proposed a system in which all communication between websites
and browsers would be shielded by encryption.
In practical terms that would be akin to
extending the sort of secure communications that banks and retailers like
Amazon use to protect their customers across the world wide web.
While
the plan is at an early stage, it has the potential to transform a large
part of the internet and make it more difficult for governments, companies
and criminals to eavesdrop on people as they browse the web.
At present,
only a fraction of all websites - typically those that handle financial
information - encrypt data when communicating with web browsers.
"There has been a complete change in how people
perceive the world" since whistleblower Edward Snowden disclosed the extent
of US surveillance programs earlier this summer, said Mike Belshe, a
software engineer and IETF member who helped develop
Google web browser Chrome.
"Not having
encryption on the web today is a
matter of life and death," he said.
The IETF push for greater use of encryption
comes alongside calls from top internet and privacy groups for fundamental
reforms of the laws governing the web.
In a letter to the FT published this
weekend, top groups including web founder Tim Berners Lee's World Wide Web
Foundation call for a "reform of the status quo" online.
"Online privacy is being eroded at a breakneck
speed by blanket surveillance, and unless steps to reform are taken
immediately, the notion of free and secure online communications will be
relegated to the annals of history," they write.
"Blanket government
surveillance by default, with laws enforced in secret, will always be
unacceptable."
The IETF, which operates through the
"rough
consensus" of its members, has been instrumental in shaping the technical
infrastructure of the web since it was founded in 1986.
While the body cannot force the adoption of its
standards, it is highly influential and its membership includes employees of
the world's biggest internet companies including
Google,
Microsoft and
Apple.
But at its conference in Berlin this month, IETF
members reached "nearly unanimous consensus" on the need to build encryption
into the heart of the web, said Mark Nottingham, a developer who chairs the IETF working group on HTTP, a data access protocol that underpins the web.
"There are a lot of people who want this to happen," he said.
Mr. Nottingham cautioned that it was
"very early
days" and said the proposal would need to undergo extensive discussion
within the broad web community before it could be implemented.
Exactly how
the plan would work has yet to be decided.
But at present the idea is to mandate the use of
Transport Layer Security
(TLS), a cryptographic protocol, in the next
version of HTTP, which is planned for 2014.
It would then be up to companies behind web
browsers and web servers to put the new standards into practice.
Google and Twitter are among several big
companies that have
long called for more encryption of web traffic. Chrome, Google's popular
web browser, already allows people to
encrypt their activity when browsing any of the company's websites.
However, security experts said that while TLS
encryption would make surveillance more difficult, it was far from
foolproof.
"If you're looking for a silver bullet to make
people's personal traffic impossible to break, this won't be it," said Sam
Curry, chief technologist at RSA, a computer security company.
Hackers, especially those with substantial
computing power, would find ways to crack the encryption or get around it by
exploiting other vulnerabilities in the network, he said.
Nonetheless, he added:
"Anything that improves trust
in the digital world is a noble aim."
