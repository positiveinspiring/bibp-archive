The unrest in
the
Middle East, the convulsions in Ivory Coast, the hunger sweeping
across failed states such as Somalia,
the freak weather patterns and the
systematic unraveling of the American empire do not signal a lurch toward
freedom and democracy but the catastrophic breakdown of globalization.
The world as we know it is coming to an end. And
what will follow will not be pleasant or easy.
The bankrupt corporate
power elite, who continue to serve the dead
ideas of,
...have proven incapable of radically shifting course or responding to our
altered reality.
They react to the great unraveling by pretending
it is not happening. They are desperately trying to maintain a doomed system
of corporate capitalism. And the worse it gets the more they embrace, and
seek to make us embrace, magical thinking.
Dozens of members of Congress in the United
States have announced that climate change does not exist and
evolution is a hoax.
They chant the mantra that the marketplace
should determine human behavior, even as the unfettered and unregulated
marketplace threw the global economy into a seizure and evaporated some $40
trillion in worldwide wealth.
The corporate media retreats as swiftly from
reality into endless mini-dramas revolving around celebrities or long
discussions about the inane comments of a Donald Trump or a Sarah
Palin.
The real world - the one imploding in our faces
- is ignored.
The deadly convergence of environmental and economic catastrophe is not
coincidental. Corporations turn everything, from human beings to the natural
world, into commodities they ruthlessly exploit until exhaustion or death.
The race of doom is now between,
Which will get us first? Or will they get us at
the same time?
Carbon emissions continue to soar upward, polar ice sheets continue to melt
at an alarming rate, hundreds of species are vanishing, fish stocks are
being dramatically depleted, droughts and floods are destroying cropland and
human habitat across the globe, water sources are being poisoned, and the
great human migration from coastlines and deserts has begun.
As temperatures continue to rise huge parts of
the globe will become uninhabitable. The continued release of large
quantities of methane, some scientists have warned, could actually
asphyxiate the human species.
And accompanying the assault on the ecosystem
that sustains human life is the cruelty and stupidity of unchecked
corporate capitalism that is creating a global economy of masters and
serfs and a world where millions will be unable to survive.
We continue to talk about personalities - Ronald Reagan,
Bill
Clinton,
George W. Bush and
Barack
Obama or
Stephen Harper - although the heads of
state and elected officials have become largely irrelevant.
-
Corporate lobbyists write the bills
-
Lobbyists get them passed
-
Lobbyists make sure you get the money to
be elected
-
Lobbyists employ you when you get
out of office
Those who hold actual power are the tiny elite
who manage the corporations.
The share of national income of the top 0.1
percent of Americans since 1974 has grown from 2.7 to 12.3 percent. One in
six American workers may be without a job. Some 40 million Americans may
live in poverty, with tens of millions more living in a category called
near poverty.
Six million people may be forced from their
homes in the United States because of foreclosures and bank repossessions.
But while the masses suffer, Goldman Sachs, one
of the financial firms most responsible for the evaporation of $17 trillion
in wages, savings and wealth of small investors and shareholders in the
United States, is giddily handing out $17.5 billion in compensation to its
managers, including $12.6 million to its CEO,
Lloyd Blankfein.
The massive redistribution of wealth happened because lawmakers and public
officials were, in essence, hired to permit it to happen.
It was not a
conspiracy. The process was transparent. It did not require the formation of
a new political party or movement. It was the result of inertia by our
political and intellectual class, which in the face of expanding
corporate power found it personally profitable to facilitate
it or look the other way.
The armies of lobbyists, who write the
legislation, bankroll political campaigns and disseminate propaganda, have
been able to short-circuit the electorate.
Our political vocabulary continues to sustain the illusion of participatory
democracy. The Democrats and the Liberal Party in Canada offer minor
palliatives and a feel-your-pain language to mask the cruelty and goals of
the corporate state.
Neofeudalism will be cemented into place whether
it is delivered by Democrats and the Liberals, who are pushing us there at
60 miles an hour, or by Republicans and the Conservatives, who are barreling
toward it at 100 miles an hour.
By fostering an illusion among the
powerless classes that it can make their interests a priority, Sheldon
Wolin writes, the Democratic Party pacifies and thereby defines the
style of an opposition party in an inverted totalitarian system.
The Democrats and the Liberals are always able
to offer up a least-worst alternative while, in fact, doing little or
nothing to thwart the march toward corporate collectivism.
It is not that the public in the United States does not want a good
healthcare system, programs that provide employment, quality public
education or an end to Wall Streets looting of the U.S. Treasury. Most
polls suggest Americans do. But it has become impossible for most citizens
in these corporate states to find out what is happening in the centers of
power.
Television news celebrities dutifully present
two opposing sides to every issue, although each side is usually lying.
The viewer can believe whatever he or she wants
to believe. Nothing is actually elucidated or explained. The sound bites by
Republicans or Democrats, the Liberals or the Conservatives, are accepted at
face value. And once the television lights are turned off, the politicians
go back to the business of serving business.
Human history, rather than being a chronicle of freedom and democracy, is
characterized by ruthless domination.
Our
elites have done what all elites do. They have found
sophisticated mechanisms to thwart popular aspirations, disenfranchise the
working and increasingly the middle class, keep us passive and make us serve
their interests.
The brief democratic opening in our society in
the early 20th century, made possible by radical movements,
unions and a vigorous press, has again been shut tight. We were mesmerized
by political charades, cheap consumerism, spectacle and magical thinking as
we were ruthlessly stripped of power.
Adequate
food,
clean water and basic security are now beyond the reach
of half the worlds population.
Food prices have risen 61 percent globally since
December 2008, according to the International Monetary Fund. The price of
wheat has exploded, more than doubling in the last eight months to $8.56 a
bushel. When half of your income is spent on food, as it is in countries
such as Yemen, Egypt, Tunisia, Somalia and Ivory Coast, price increases of
this magnitude bring with them widespread malnutrition and starvation.
Food prices in the United States have risen over
the past three months at an annualized rate of five percent.
There are some 40 million poor in the United
States who devote 35 percent of their after-tax incomes to pay for food. As
the cost of fossil fuel climbs, as climate change continues to disrupt
agricultural production and as populations and unemployment swell, we will
find ourselves convulsed in more global and domestic unrest.
Food riots and political protests will be
frequent, as will malnutrition and starvation. Desperate people employ
desperate measures to survive. And the elites will use the surveillance and
security state to attempt to crush all forms of popular dissent.
The last people who should be in charge of our food supply or our social and
political life, not to mention the welfare of sick children, are corporate
capitalists and Wall Street speculators.
But none of this is going to change until we
turn our backs on the wider society, denounce the orthodoxies peddled in our
universities and in the press by corporate apologists and construct our
opposition to the corporate state from the ground up. It will not be easy.
It will take time. And it will require us to accept the status of social and
political pariahs, especially as the lunatic fringe of our political
establishment steadily gains power as the crisis mounts.
The corporate state has nothing to offer
the left or the right but fear. It uses fear to turn the population
into passive accomplices. And as long as we remain afraid, or believe that
the formal mechanisms of power can actually bring us real reform, nothing
will change.
It does not matter, as writers such as John Ralston Saul have pointed
out, that every one of globalisms promises has turned out to be a lie.
It does not matter that economic inequality has
gotten worse and that most of the worlds wealth has become concentrated in
a few hands. It does not matter that the middle class - the beating heart of
any democracy - is disappearing and that the rights and wages of the working
class have fallen into precipitous decline as labor regulations, protection
of our manufacturing base and labor unions have been demolished.
It does not matter that corporations have used
the destruction of trade barriers as a mechanism for massive tax evasion, a
technique that allows conglomerates such as General Electric or Bank of
America to avoid paying any taxes. It does not matter that
corporations are exploiting and killing the ecosystem for profit.
The steady barrage of illusions disseminated by
corporate systems of propaganda, in which words are often replaced with
music and images, are impervious to truth.
Faith in the marketplace replaces for many faith
in an omnipresent God. And those who dissent are banished as
heretics.
The aim of the corporate state is not to feed, clothe or house the masses
but to shift all economic, social and political power and wealth into the
hands of the tiny corporate elite. It is to create a world where the heads
of corporations make $900,000 an hour and four-job families struggle to
survive.
The corporate elite achieves its aims of greater and greater
profit by weakening and dismantling government agencies and taking over or
destroying public institutions.
-
charter schools
-
mercenary armies
-
a for-profit health insurance industry
-
outsourcing every facet of government
work, from clerical tasks to intelligence,
...feed the corporate beast at our expense.
The decimation of labor unions, the twisting of
education into mindless vocational training and the slashing of social
services leave us ever more enslaved to the whims of corporations.
The intrusion of corporations into the public
sphere destroys the concept of the common good. It erases the lines between
public and private interests. It creates a world that is defined exclusively
by naked self-interest.
Many of us are seduced by childish happy talk.
-
Who wants to hear that we are
advancing not toward a paradise of happy consumption and
personal prosperity but toward disaster?
-
Who wants to confront a future in which
the rapacious and greedy appetites of our global elite, who
have failed to protect the planet, threaten to produce widespread
anarchy, famine, environmental catastrophe, nuclear terrorism and
wars for diminishing resources?
-
Who wants to shatter the myth that the
human race is evolving morally, that it can continue its
giddy plundering of nonrenewable resources and its hedonistic levels
of consumption, that capitalist expansion is eternal and will never
cease?
Dying civilizations often prefer hope,
even absurd hope, to truth.
It makes life easier to bear. It lets them turn
away from the hard choices ahead to bask in a comforting certitude that
God or science or the market will be their salvation.
This is why these apologists for
globalism continue to find a following. And
their systems of propaganda have built a vast, global Potemkin village to
entertain us. The tens of millions of impoverished Americans, whose lives
and struggles rarely make it onto television, are invisible. So are most of
the worlds billions of poor, crowded into fetid slums.
We do not see those who die from drinking
contaminated water or being unable to afford medical care. We do not see
those being foreclosed from their homes. We do not see the children who go
to bed hungry. We busy ourselves with the absurd.
The game is over. We lost.
The corporate state will continue its inexorable
advance until two-thirds of the nation and the planet is locked into a
desperate, permanent underclass. Most of us will struggle to make a living
while the Blankfeins and our political elites wallow in the decadence and
greed of the Forbidden City and Versailles.
These elites do not have a vision. They know
only one word: more.
They will continue to exploit the nation, the
global economy and the ecosystem. And they will use their money to hide in
gated compounds when it all implodes.
Do not expect them to take care of us when it
starts to unravel. We will have to take care of ourselves. We will have to
rapidly create small, monastic communities where we can sustain and feed
ourselves. It will be up to us to keep alive the intellectual, moral and
cultural values the corporate state has attempted to snuff out.
It is either that or become drones and serfs in
a global corporate dystopia. It is not much of a choice.
But at least we still have one.
