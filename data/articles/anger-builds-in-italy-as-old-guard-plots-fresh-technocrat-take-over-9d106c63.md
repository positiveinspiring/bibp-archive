# Anger Builds in Italy as Old Guard Plots Fresh Technocrat Take-Over

Mr Grillo repeated his
call for an online referendum on the Euro
and vowed to buy back 600bn of Italian bonds held by foreigners if his
movement gains power, a de facto default and withdrawal from the
EMU
system.
He has in the past called for
Argentine-style haircuts for bondholders.
Within a year we wont have enough
money left to pay the pensions and public sector wages, he told
told Bild am Sonntag.
His newly-elected army of senators and
deputies - fresh-faced idealists in their 20s or early-30s with no
experience in public life - met for a conclave to thrash out the party
line.
Most of the 163 grillini have never met
their leader, or each other. They crowded into a room at the Hotel Saint
John, many sitting on the floor with their napsacks as if it was opening
day at university.
Their first action was to create a Google
group to handle logistics.
Nothing like this has ever happened
before in the history of the Italian Republic. We are seeing a true
crisis of the regime, said Professor Luca Ricolfi from Turin
University.
Investors have discounted Mr Grillos wild
rhetoric as comic chatter, but his relish for shattering taboos in
putting unthinkable ideas into play.
People in Brussels can handle old-style
politicians like Silvio Berlusconi but Grillo really worries them
because this is a protest against the entire system, and they are
afraid it is spreading to other countries, said Giles Merritt from
Friends of Europe.
The EU policy elites are increasingly alert
to the danger of losing popular consent for the EU Project.
European Central Bank governor Benoit
Coeure said Europe must pay more attention to the social contract
if it is to avoid feeding nationalist temptations.
Mr Coeure warned that record unemployment
across much of Europe - reaching 59% for Greek youth - was eroding the
job skills of a generation and doing lasting damage to future growth.
While the tone is changing, there is no sign
yet of a retreat from fiscal belt-tightening.
Given that average debt exceeds 90% of
GDP in the EU, I dont think theres any room for maneuver to leave
the path of budgetary consolidation, said EU economics chief Olli
Rehn.
We wont solve our growth problems by
piling new debt on top of our old debt, he said.
Defying his critics, Mr Olli Rehn
said John Maynard Keynes himself would not be a Keynesian todays
circumstances.
Yet Mr Rehn also warned Germany politicians
that it would be courting fate to push Cyprus into default and exit from
the Eurozone in the belief that the island is too small to pose a
contagion risk.
Even if you come from a big EU country,
you should be aware that every member of the euro zone is
systemically relevant, he told Der Spiegel.
Separately, it emerged that the Eurozone
bail-out fund (ESM)
may not be used after all to recapitalize banks, even once the banking
super-regulator is in place.
Klaus Regling, the fund's chief, said
opposition from the creditor states may kill the idea altogether.
If so, this will breaches a summit accord in
June by EU leaders to deploy the ESM directly to break the vicious
circle between banks and sovereign states.
Failure to implement the deal would be a
blow for Ireland and Italy, leaving them shouldering the full burden
left from a bank crisis that was partly caused by northern creditors.
The
International Monetary Fund said it is
imperative that the EU upholds the specific pledge made to Ireland in
the summit text. Germany, Austria, Finland, and Holland have all all
said they would not let the ESM cover "legacy assets" left from the
bubble.
They now seem to be resiling from the accord
altogether.
Italy Paralyzed as Grillo Plots...
Exit Route from Euro

This Election Shows Why
Italy Remains Europe's Most Dangerous Basket Case.
Italy plunged deeper into political chaos this
weekend after Beppe Grillo, the quixotic former
comedian who holds the balance of power in
parliament, suggested that the country may have to
abandon the euro
and return to the lire.

conditions do not change'

The rebel comic's warning came amid a
growing rebellion among grass-roots supporters of his Five Star
Movement, with 150,000 signing a petition calling for him to
open up dialogue with the centre-Left Democratic Party, the biggest
force in parliament.
With the country in political paralysis,
there were also questions over his eccentric behavior, after the
surreal public appearance of a man, either Beppe Grillo or
one of his supporters, with his face obscured by a zipped up puffer
jacket and a pair of ski goggles.
The bizarre figure, resembling a human
fly, waved at photographers from the deck of Mr Grillo's beach house
at Marina di Bibbona on the coast of Tuscany.
In an interview with a German magazine,
Mr Grillo warned that,
"if conditions do not change" Italy
"will want" to leave the euro and return to the lire.
The 64-year-old comic-turned-political
activist also said Italy needs to renegotiate its 2 trillion debt.
At 127% of gross domestic product
(GDP), it is the highest in the Eurozone after Greece.
"Right now we are being crushed, not
by the euro, but by our debt," he told Focus, a weekly
news magazine. "When the interest payments reach 100 billion a
year, we're dead. There's no alternative."
He said Italy was in such dire economic
straits that,
"in six months, we will no longer be
able to pay pensions and the wages of public employees".
The comments will further hamper efforts to
resolve the crisis caused by Italy's general election last week, in
which Mr Grillo's web-based, anti-establishment movement won more than a
quarter of the vote .
He is refusing to contemplate any sort of
power-sharing deal with the centre-Left Democratic Party, which has
shaky control of the upper and lower houses of parliament but lacks a
big enough majority to form a government.
In the Focus interview, he said that
an accord with the big parties would in theory be possible if they
acceded to key parts of his movement's agenda, including,
-
limiting MPs' parliamentary service
to two terms
-
an overhaul of the election system
-
the slashing of the lavish perks
enjoyed by politicians
"But they will never do that," he said.
"They are trying to make us believe that they will, just to gain
time."
Mr Grillo, renowned for his blistering
attacks on Italy's established political caste, last week called Pier
Luigi Bersani, the leader of the Democratic Party,
"a dead man talking".
In the interview published yesterday he
predicted the annihilation of both the centre-Left and the centre-Right
coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi, the 76-year-old playboy who
has been prime minister three times.
They would be around for another "six
months" but then they would be "finished", he said.
He also insisted that his party would not
take part in any "horse-trading", describing the overtures from the Left
as,
"the usual whorish way of doing
politics."
But he faces a growing clamor among his
grass-roots supporters, however, to open up dialogue with the Democratic
Party in order to break the log jam and form some sort of credible
government.
An online petition begun on Wednesday by
Viola Tesi, a 24-year-old member of the Five Star Movement from
Florence, had by yesterday gathered nearly 150,000 signatures.
Miss Tesi wrote an open letter to Mr Grillo
on the website,
www.change.org, appealing to him not to
"waste" her vote but to give a confidence vote to the Democratic Party
so that a reforming government can be formed.
Grillo supporters should harness their
unexpected triumph at the polls to compel the centre-Left to adopt the
policies that would make Italy a better country, she said.
"We should embrace the challenge and
start changing Italy straight away, for the benefit of all," she
wrote in the letter.
But with Mr Grillo apparently ignoring those
appeals, the three-way deadlock has raised fears about Italy's ability
to maintain desperately needed economic reforms initiated by Mario
Monti, the former technocrat prime minister.
The comedian has said that his movement will
remain outside any government, voting on individual bills in parliament
on a case-by-case basis. Adding to the uncertainty is the fact that Mr
Grillo refuses to talk to Italian journalists or to appear on current
affairs television talk shows.
Italian reporters who have telephoned him
and asked to speak to the general secretary of the party claim he has
told them:
"Hang on, I'll just pass you to my 12
year old son."
The new parliament has to meet by March 15
at the latest, after which formal talks with Giorgio Napolitano,
the octogenarian Italian president, are scheduled to begin on the
formation of a new government.
In the space of just three years, Mr
Grillo's movement has come from nowhere to place him in the role of
kingmaker.
During the election campaign he travelled
Italy in a camper van in what he dubbed his "Tsunami Tour", filling
piazzas with cheering supporters as he railed against entrenched
political and business interests.
One prominent supporter is Dario Fo,
the 86-year-old playwright and satirist, whose best known works include
Accidental Death of an Anarchist and We Can't Pay, We Won't
Pay - an apposite title given Mr Grillo's threats regarding Italy's
debt.
Mr Fo said yesterday:
"Satire can uncover big ideas and bring
about huge upheavals. Beppe Grillo is a man of satire, that's where
he came from, and that is his strength."
Mr Grillo's success means his party is
poised to send more than 160 members into parliament's two chambers.
Many are in their twenties and thirties and very few have any political
experience, raising fears of legislative chaos if a government is
eventually formed.
The "Grillini", as they are known, include
nurses, teachers, students, lawyers, engineers, molecular biologists,
bank clerks, and architects.
Some are unemployed. All are under 50 - a
novelty in a country in which many politicians are well into their
seventies.
Critics say they will be clueless in
parliament and that their reliance on internet-based democracy to
determine policies will be a recipe for disaster. Mr Grillo says their
lack of political experience means they are untainted by corruption and
cynicism.
One new MP, Ivan Catalano, 26, who
works at a metal machining factory north of Milan, told The Sunday
Telegraph:
"I am a normal citizen like any, who
thanks to this new way of doing politics, will enter into
parliament. "The message is that change is possible. We don't have
to put up with the same old methods, and the same old people."
He acknowledged there were differences of
opinion within the movement but denied it was an open schism.
"It is a healthy dialogue," he said.
The movement's policies include tax cuts, a
big increase in health spending and investment in the "green economy",
but it has struggled to explain how this will be paid given Italy's
mountain of debt.
Mr Grillo also wants deep cuts in defence
spending and the scrapping of a high-speed rail link to France beneath
the Alps.
The movement's newly-elected MPs and
senators will meet one other for the first time in Rome on Monday to
discuss whether to ignore their leader and support some sort of
coalition.
Italians are divided as to whether the
movement promises fresh blood for an anemic, corrupt system, or
political and economic disaster for a country already mired in
recession.
"Beppe Grillo is a pistol pointed
against Italy's head," was the front cover headline in last week's
edition of Panorama, a conservative news magazine.
Another news weekly, Oggi, ran a photograph
of Mr Grillo with the words,
"Now what?"
