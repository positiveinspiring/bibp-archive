Americans are confronted with what appears to be
the worse economic situation since the Great Depression.
What will history say about the U.S. credit
crisis turned global financial crisis?
At every turn investors are faced with new
problems, new crises, and less than desirable solutions which include debt,
deflation and a transfer of wealth.
With regard to debt, the American taxpayer has been made the lender of last
resort for international bank Bear Stearns and now the two
Government-sponsored Enterprises-GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
On top of the $29B for Bear Stearns, Fannie and
Freddie's debt of $5.4T has been effectively transferred to the balance
sheet of the USA.
This is equal to the entire publicly traded debt
of the U.S. which is also the same as the total of America's
mortgage-related assets. In addition to personal debt, every American now
has a financial responsibility for Bear Stearns and Fannie and Freddie.
We, the people, have saved the foreign investors such as China which owns
$376B, Japan which owns $228B, South Korea which owns $65B, Taiwan which
owns $55B, and Australia which owns $33B, from losing faith in America. It
is the stockholders, both common and preferred, that have been given the raw
end of the deal.
While large financial institutions such as JP
Morgan, which owns $1.2B of Freddie and Fannie stock, said a complete loss
would only erase one or two months of profits, contrast this to smaller
banks such as the Central Virginia Bank in Richmond which has $20M in shares
of Freddie and Fannie.
That type of loss will put them in the same kind
of trouble as Lehman Brothers, not enough capitalization. There are 15 other
banks that hold 10% or more of their capital in shares of Freddie and
Fannie.
The Federal Accounting Standards Board is requiring more stringent
standards for banks and savings and loans to maintain a certain amount of
capital to protect against insolvency. Those rules are in the process of
being changed to conform to international rules issued by the
Bank for International Settlements in
Basel, Switzerland which Congress has voted on.
These rules which were only to pertain to
international banks are now being applied to national banks.
Furthermore those in retirement who thought their money was safe-invested in
the highest ranked bonds in the country are going to lose their dividends.
Depending on the price they invested, they could have principal losses of up
to 80 or 90% of their investment. Ouch...
The credit crunch began a year ago when the various investment banks both
here and abroad stopped buying each others paper, a very uncommon practice
between them. As a result of no liquidity for mortgage paper caused by their
decision, we have the most serious slowdown in real estate in decades.
The decision to not buy mortgage paper includes
the sub-prime loans made to home buyers that had no down payment. To relate,
I recently met a young Latino who is worried about her home. Five years ago
she bought a $370,000 townhouse with $14,000 down. Her interest rate varies
causing her monthly payment to jump from $2700 per month to $3500. She
cleans houses for a living.
Freddie and Fannie decided they could make more money by buying subprime
mortgage paper. Today there is an eleven month inventory of unsold homes.
Higher interest rates as a result of the hidden clauses on floating interest
rates have put many people in jeopardy of foreclosure. All of these problems
have given
the Federal Reserve the opportunity to
seize total control of powers they did not oversee in order to protect
our economy.
Perhaps we should ask where the desire to put
poor people into homes came from? It was part of the Bush
Administration's policy to conform to the United Nations' Millennium
Development Goals unveiled in the year 2000.
Exacerbating the credit crunch have been the historically high oil prices
which have caused pain at the gas pumps and a weak dollar which has made
imports more expensive. To counter high oil prices, Americans have
drastically reduced how many miles they drive and a number of buying habits.
In light of a tight job market and job losses in housing and the automotive
industries, we are confronted with higher energy costs to heat and cool our
homes, increased costs for food, and the inability to refinance mortgages.
Basically the economy is now in deflation.
When people stop spending, it moves from
deflation to stagflation-no matter how cheap an item becomes, people can't
afford to buy. All this without knowing what the real fall out will be from
the bailout of Freddie and Fannie.
The situation we are confronted with did not happen in the last few years,
but began in 1913 when a group of cunningly deceitful legislators passed the
Federal Reserve Act on December 24 at 11:45 p.m., after those who were
opposed went home for Christmas. The entire financial system of the U.S. was
transferred from Congress to a private corporation that is NOT accountable
to Congress.
They create and destroy the business cycle by
various means: raising and lowering interest rates. The government of the
United States is in bondage to a group of individuals who own the Federal
Reserve. The reason why the American people cannot forgive themselves the
interest on our debt is because we do not owe it to ourselves we owe it to
the Federal Reserve!
Every single time since then that the Federal
Reserve Act was amended, over 195 times, the Federal Reserve gathered more
power over various aspects of our economy. However, they are in the final
throes of stripping America of any remaining vestiges of sovereignty as has
been laid out in the Treasury "Blueprint for a Modernized Financial
Regulatory System."
The Blueprint was written under the watchful eye of one of America's
most successful international bankers, former Goldman Sachs CEO Hank
Paulson, who is now our illustrious Treasury Secretary. Is this
not a case of the fox in the chicken coup?
Long time investment sage Marty Whitman
commented on his actions,
"Paulson thinks he is in Russia and is not
giving any value to stockholders. It is outrageous that the Treasury
Secretary is not giving any consideration to the shareholders."
The Blueprint calls for key components of our
financial system, not currently under Federal Reserve control, to be
transferred to them. In order to do this, a number of changes will be
necessary which Congress will have to approve.
First, it recommends changing the banking
charter to include all financial institutions, thus effectively transferring
control over "national banks, federal savings associations, and federal [and
state] credit union charters."
For your information, Washington Mutual is a
savings and loan while Lehman Brothers is and Bear Stearns was an
international bank. The Fed is to be given authority over the U.S.
Payment and Settlement System thereby controlling the settlement process
for securities. It will be given the role of Market Stability Regulator and
it will have total control over the market.
The Blueprint provides for the entire mortgage
system of the U.S. to be federalized and to be under the control of the
Mortgage Origination Commission. The Federal Reserve will be part of the
Commission. Additionally the Federal Reserve will be given a say in the
insurance industry which will be federalized and a new Office of Insurance
Oversight will oversee its activities.
The Federal Reserve will have a place on the
Insurance Oversight commission.
By the time Congress votes on the Blueprint, there will be so many reasons
for them to transfer the last vestiges of our financial sovereignty to the
Federal Reserve that they will not even have to read the prepared
legislation.
So far, we have the bailout of Freddie and
Fannie by giving Treasury a blank check to act; the Federal Reserve worked
all weekend to find a buyer to Lehman, another international bank, their
next project might be to rescue Washington Mutual, a savings and loan, and
the Fed has been given initial powers to act as the Market Stability
Regulator.
The only component that is missing is the demise
of an insurance company, AIG anyone?
For the record, at the heart of the Blueprint is changing our
financial/banking and securities regulatory system from a national system to
an international system to bring America into the world governmental system
that functions above the nation-states. I have maintained that in order to
get Congress to go along, we would have to have a huge problem which would
allow Congress to be convinced that they need to act, however, the truth of
the matter is they no longer have the power they once had because the
majority has been transferred to the Federal Reserve.
History will determine how the final stage was set but I believe it started
in 2000 with the Crash of the Nasdaq. Who would have ever thought
that a stock would drop 90% in value?
About $7T vanished from the balance sheets of
investors.
But we did not have to worry, as a result of
9/11,
the Federal Reserve started to reduce interest rates to 45 year lows to get
Americans to support the economy by buying the dream home. We bit the bait.
It was the Roaring 20s all over again. At one point in the housing
boom, one out of four jobs was created by the housing industry.
No one asked if they could afford the debt, they
only asked if they could afford the payment: a big difference.
They did not ask the right questions about their
mortgage because the mortgage industry was not required to disclose to them,
when it should have. At one time the mortgage industry was run on honesty
and integrity, but that changed too and people have been caught in a
terrible snare.
The Bailout of Freddie and Fannie provide us with the latest
excitement in the diabolical saga of the raping, robbing, and pillaging
of America.
Interestingly enough it took place 13 months
after the beginning of the credit crunch. Lastly, I have maintained since
the beginning of the credit crunch last August that it was planned and
managed destruction in order to accomplish the final transfer of America's
financial sovereignty.
All of the above only confirms my original
suspicion.
Sadly, only the strong will survive, only those
who did not use their house as a checking account will survive in the midst
of the Great 2008 Transfer of Wealth.
