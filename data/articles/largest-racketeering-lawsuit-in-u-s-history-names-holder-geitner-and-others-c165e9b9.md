Major Banks, Governmental Officials and
Their Comrade Capitalists Targets
of Spire Law Group, LLP's Racketeering and Money
Laundering Lawsuit
Seeking Return of $43 Trillion to the United
States Treasury
NEW YORK, Oct. 25, 2012 /PRNewswire via COMTEX
Spire Law Group, LLP's national home owners'
lawsuit, pending in the venue where the "Banksters" control their $43
trillion racketeering scheme (New York).
Known as the largest money laundering and
racketeering lawsuit in United States History and identifying $43 trillion
($43,000,000,000,000.00) of laundered money by the "Banksters" and their
U.S. racketeering partners and joint ventures.
The lawsuit now pinpoints the identities of the
key racketeering partners of the "Banksters" located in the highest offices
of government and acting for their own self-interests.
In connection with the federal lawsuit now impending in the United States
District Court in Brooklyn, New York (Case No. 12-cv-04269-JBW-RML) -
involving, among other things, a request that the District Court enjoin all
mortgage foreclosures by the Banksters nationwide, unless and until the
entire $43 trillion is repaid to a court-appointed receiver.
Plaintiffs now establish the location of the $43
trillion ($43,000,000,000,000.00) of laundered money in a racketeering
enterprise participated in by the following individuals (without
limitation):
-
Attorney General Holder acting in his
individual capacity
-
Assistant Attorney General Tony West,
the brother in law of Defendant California Attorney General Kamala
Harris (both acting in their individual capacities)
-
Jon Corzine (former New Jersey Governor)
-
Robert Rubin (former Treasury Secretary
and Bankster)
-
Timothy Geitner, Treasury Secretary
(acting in his individual capacity)
-
Vikram Pandit (recently resigned and
disgraced Chairman of the Board of Citigroup)
-
Valerie Jarrett (a Senior White House
Advisor)
-
Anita Dunn (a former "communications
director" for the Obama Administration)
-
Robert Bauer (husband of Anita Dunn and
Chief Legal Counsel for the Obama Re-election Campaign),
...as well as the "Banksters" themselves, and
their affiliates and conduits.
The lawsuit alleges serial violations of,
-
the
United States Patriot Act
-
the Policy of Embargo Against Iran and Countries
Hostile to the Foreign Policy of the United States
-
the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (commonly known as the RICO
statute),
...and other State and Federal laws.
In the District Court lawsuit, Spire Law Group, LLP - on behalf of home
owner across the Country and New York taxpayers, as well as under other
taxpayer recompense laws - has expanded its mass tort action into federal
court in Brooklyn, New York, seeking to halt all foreclosures nationwide
pending the return of the $43 trillion ($43,000,000,000.00) by the "Banksters"
and their co-conspirators, seeking an audit of the FED and audits of all the
"bailout programs" by an independent receiver such as Neil Barofsky, former
Inspector General of
the TARP program who has stated that none of the TARP
money and other "bailout money" advanced from the Treasury has ever been
repaid despite protestations to the contrary by the Defendants as well as
similar protestations by President
Obama and the Obama Administration both
publicly on national television and more privately to the United States
Congress.
Because the Obama Administration has failed to
pursue any of the "Banksters" criminally, and indeed is actively borrowing
monies for Mr. Obama's campaign from these same "Banksters" to finance its
political aspirations, the national group of plaintiff home owners has been
forced to now expand its lawsuit to include racketeering, money laundering
and intentional violations of the Iranian Nations Sanctions and Embargo Act
by the national banks included among the "Bankster" Defendants.
The complaint - which has now been fully served on thousands of the "Banksters
and their Co-Conspirators" - makes it irrefutable that the epicenter of this
laundering and racketeering enterprise has been and continues to be Wall
Street and continues to involve the very "Banksters" located there who have
repeatedly asked in the past to be "bailed out" and to be "bailed out" in
the future.
The Havens for the money laundering schemes - and certain of the names and
places of these entities - are located in such venues as,
-
Switzerland
-
the
Isle of Man
-
Luxembourg
-
Malaysia
-
Cyprus,
...and entities controlled by
governments adverse to the interests of the United States Sanctions and
Embargo Act against Iran, and are also identified in both the United Nations
and the U.S. Senate's recent reports on international money laundering.
Many
of these entities have already been personally served with summons and
process of the complaint during the last six months.
It is now beyond
dispute that, while the Obama Administration was publicly encouraging loan
modifications for home owners by "Banksters", it was privately ratifying the
formation of these shell companies in violation of the United States Patriot
Act, and State and Federal law.
The case further alleges that through these
obscure foreign companies,
-
Bank of America
-
J.P. Morgan
-
Wells Fargo Bank
-
Citibank
-
Citigroup
-
One West Bank,
...and numerous other federally chartered
banks stole trillions of dollars of home owners' and taxpayers' money during
the last decade and then laundered it through offshore companies.
This District Court Complaint - maintained by
Spire Law Group, LLP - is the
only lawsuit in the world listing as Defendants the Banksters, let alone
serving all of such Banksters with legal process and therefore forcing them
to finally answer the charges in court.
Neither,
-
the Securities and Exchange
Commission
-
nor the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
-
the Office of
the Attorney General
-
any State Attorney General,
...has sued the Banksters
and thereby legally chased them worldwide to recover-back the $43 trillion
($43,000,000,000,000.00) and other lawful damages, injunctive relief and
other legal remedies.
James N. Fiedler, Managing Partner of Spire Law Group, LLP, stated:
"It is
hard for me to believe as a 47-year lawyer that our nation's guardians have
been unwilling to stop this theft.
Spire Law Group, LLP stands for the
elimination of corruption and implementation of lawful strategies, and that
is what we're doing here. Spire Law Group, LLP's charter is to not allow
such corruption to go unanswered."
Comments were requested from the Attorney Generals' offices in NY, CA, NV,
NH , OH, MA and the White House, but no comment was provided.
