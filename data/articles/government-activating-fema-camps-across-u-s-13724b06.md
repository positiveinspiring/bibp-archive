Infowars Website
Infowars.com has received a document originating
from Halliburton subsidiary KBR that provides details on a push to outfit
FEMA and U.S. Army camps around the United States.
Entitled Project
Overview and Anticipated Project Requirements, the document
describes services KBR is looking to farm out to subcontractors. The
document was passed on to us by a state government employee who wishes to
remain anonymous for obvious reasons.
Services up for bid include catering, temporary
fencing and barricades, laundry and medical services, power generation,
refuse collection, and other services required for temporary emergency
environment camps located in five regions of the United States.
Internment Camp
Services Bid Arrives After NDAA
KBRs call for FEMA camp service bids arrives soon after the Senate
overwhelmingly passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which
permits the military to detain and interrogate supposed domestic terror
suspects in violation of the Fourth Amendment and Posse Comitatus.
Section 1031 of the NDAA bill declares the whole of the United States as a
battlefield and allows American citizens to be arrested on U.S. soil and
incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay.
A number of civil liberties groups have come out in strong opposition to the
legislation, most notably the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), the
nations oldest and largest Asian American civil and human rights
organization.
In a letter addressed to Congress, S. Floyd Mori, the national director of JACL, said the NDAA is the first time that Congress has scaled back on the
protections provided by the Non-Detention Act of 1971.
Mori said the
legislation, if enacted and put into use, would be reminiscent of the
unconstitutional indefinite detention of Japanese Americans during World War
II.

KBR Instrumental in
Establishing Camps in 2006
In 2006, KBR was awarded a contingency contract from the Department of
Homeland Security, allegedly to support its Immigration and Customs
Enforcement facilities in the event of an emergency, Market Watch reported.
The contract was effective immediately and provided for establishing
temporary detention and processing capabilities to expand existing ICE
Detention and Removal Operations Program facilities in the event of an
emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S., or to support the rapid
development of new programs, KBR said.
The contract may also provide migrant
detention support to other government organizations in the event of an
immigration emergency, as well as the development of a plan to react to a
national emergency, such as a natural disaster, the company explained.

Army Releases Civilian Inmate Labor Program Document
Soon after KBRs announcement, a little-known Army document surfaced.
Entitled the Civilian Inmate Labor Program, the unclassified document
describes in detail Army Regulation 210-35.
The regulation, first drafted in
1997, underwent a rapid act revision in January 2005 and now provides a
policy for the creation of labor programs and prison camps on Army
installations.
National Emergency Centers Act
In 2009, the National Emergency Centers Act or HR 645 was introduced in
Congress.
It mandates the establishment of national emergency centers to
be located on military installations for the purpose of providing,
temporary
housing, medical, and humanitarian assistance to individuals and families
dislocated due to an emergency or major disaster, according to the bill.
In addition to emergencies, the legislation is designed to,
meet other
appropriate needs, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security,
...an
open ended mandate which many fear could mean the forced detention of
American citizens in the event of widespread rioting after a national
emergency or total economic collapse, as Paul Joseph Watson noted in January
of 2009.

Also in 2009, the Army National Guard began posting advertisements calling
for Internment/Resettlement Specialists, a fact noted by Infowars.com,
Prison Planet.com and other alternative media outlets but ignored by the
establishment media.
Precursor - Rex 84 Mass Detention Operation
Rex 84, short for Readiness Exercise 1984, was established under the pretext
of a mass exodus of illegal aliens crossing the Mexican/US border, the
same pretense used in the language of the KBR request for services.
During the Iran-Contra hearings in 1987, however, it was revealed that the
program was a secretive scenario and drill developed by the federal
government to suspend the Constitution, declare martial law, assign military
commanders to take over state and local governments, and detain large
numbers of American citizens determined by the government to be national
security threats.
Rex 84 was devised by Col. Oliver North, who was with the NSC and appointed
liaison to FEMA.
John Brinkerhoff, the deputy director of national
preparedness programs for FEMA, and North designed the plan on a 1970
report written by FEMA chief Louis Giuffrida, at the Army War College, which
proposed the detention of up to 21 million American Negroes in the event
of a black militant uprising in the United States.
DHS Coordinating Occupy Arrests
Following a crackdown by police on Occupy Wall Street protesters around the
nation, Oakland, California, mayor
Jean Quan mentioned during an interview
with the BBC that she was on a conference call with leaders of 18 US cities
shortly before a wave of raids broke up Occupy Wall Street encampments
across the country.
It was later discovered that the FBI, the Department of
Homeland Security and other federal police agencies
had coordinated the
often violent response to the protests.
New York Rep.
Peter King, who heads up the House Homeland Security
Subcommittee, signaled a sense of urgency when he said the federal
government has,
to be careful not to allow this movement to get any
legitimacy. Im taking this seriously in that Im old enough to remember
what happened in the 1960â€²s when the left-wing took to the streets and
somehow the media glorified them and it ended up shaping policy. We cant
allow that to happen.
The federal government responded similarly in the 1960s and 70s when the FBI
organized and unleashed its unconstitutional secret police under the covert
banner of COINTELPRO.
In addition to the DHS characterizing Americans supporting states rights
and the Constitution as terrorists, the Defense Departments Antiterrorism
and Force Protection Annual Refresher Training Course in 2009 advised its
personnel that
political protest amounts to low-level terrorism.
Elements of the Police State Coming Together
The KBR document is more evidence that the federal government has
established internment camps and plans to fill them with dissidents and
anti-government activists that have been demonized consistently by the
establishment media.
The NDAA was crafted precisely to provide the legal mechanism for tasking
the military to round up activists it conflates with al-Qaeda terrorists.
The plan was initially envisioned by
Rex 84 and in particular
Operation
Garden Plot, an operational plan to use the Army, USAF, Navy, and Marine
Corp. in direct support of civil disturbance control operations.
It has
since added numerous elements under the rubric of Continuity of Government,
the overall war on terror, civil disturbance and emergency response.
The government has patiently put into place the crucial elements of its
police state grid and overarching plan for the internment of political
enemies.
We are quite literally one terror event away from the plan going live. As
the DHS and the establishment media keep telling us, the next terror event
will be on American soil and not the work of al-Qaeda but domestic patriot
political groups.
The FBI has specialized in creating domestic terrorists - or rather patsies
- and shifting the blame over to their political enemies.
