Walt Disneys testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee on
October 24, 1947 - in which he declared,
"Everybody in my studio is
one-hundred-percent American,"
...while he also named a number of former
employees who had organized a labor strike as "Communists" - signified the
culmination of a long-standing relationship of collaboration between the
Walt Disney Company and the American government.2
Disney told the committee that he felt the best
strategy for safeguarding "all of the good, free causes in this country, all
of the liberalisms that really are American" would be to uncover the
"un-American" labor activists who had infiltrated the motion picture
industry and had propagated their Communist "ideologies," which in turn were
directly responsible for activities such as the 1941 strike at the Disney
studio in Burbank, California.3
Meanwhile, other reasons cited for the strike,
such as the companys "arbitrary and manipulative pay structure" and the
illegal firing of union activists working with the Screen Cartoonists
Guild, were simply ignored.4
According to Walt Disney in 1941,
individuals such as the labor organizers who had "called my plant a
sweatshop" needed to be "smoked out and shown up for what they are" in order
to "keep the American labor unions clean" and to preserve "good, solid
Americans" from "the taint of communism." 5
Disneys justification of the states use of
repressive force in order to secure American freedom may not sound quite so
unfamiliar today, following the events of
September 11, 2001.
Since 9/11,
several reports have emerged exposing a U.S. government that used illegal
wiretapping with impunity, lied about the reasons for invading Iraq in 2003,
sanctioned the torture of alleged terrorists, and imprisoned so-called enemy
combatants - including children - denying them basic legal rights such as
the right to a fair trial.6
Indeed, state repression and patriotic
correctness at their most extreme became the normal state of affairs in a
post-9/11 world characterized by domestic surveillance, the erosion of civil
liberties, and an ideological and military campaign waged against the threat
of "terrorism" that involved the construction of a vast secret and illegal
apparatus of violence.
Despite the Disney corporations perennial claim that its products are
simply about entertainment, Disney/ABCs
The Path to 9/11 (2006) and
Disney/Pixars
The Incredibles (2004) both attest to the companys
endorsement of, if not active participation in, partisan political issues,
especially the "war on terror" and the emerging security culture in the
United States.
Disneys history of making alliances with state
power is not surprising, given its corporate interest in reaching large
audiences and perpetuating dominant cultural forms, but not since its
production of several films for the U.S. military during World War II has
Disney participated in the dissemination of such overt political propaganda.
While the Walt Disney Companys patriotic fervor
during World War II has generated little critical response over the years,
Disneys productions since 9/11 have been more controversial, yet few
critics have gone so far as to argue that the messages produced by The Path
to 9/11 and The Incredibles do not support the status quo as much as they
present a reactionary politics, which not only justifies U.S. military power
abroad but also suggests deeply authoritarian ideas and practices are the
best way to secure the ongoing domination of American cultural identity at
home.
Both films solicit their viewers support and
appear to occupy solid (and therefore unquestionable) moral ground by taking
a critical stance that positions the lone protagonists outside repressive
cultures dominated by mindless bureaucracies.
The films ultimately sacrifice an understanding
of the systemic causes of war and violence in favor of blaming individuals
who exhibit pathological behaviors that go far beyond character flaws or
mere cowardice.
Of course, the demonization of the other and the
representation of individuals who challenge institutional stagnancy as
heroic are not new to those familiar with discourses of hyperindividualism,
competitiveness, and jingoistic nationalism in the dominant media in the
United States, but the justification of violence as the primary means to
achieve these goals has not been asserted so boldly as before, except
perhaps if one considers the history of Disney films.
At the onset of World War II, Walt Disney was not alone in his belief that
film should play a dominant role in the teaching process or, as he claimed,
in "molding opinion." 7
He was, however, at the forefront of a movement
to recognize a "new aspect of the use of films in war": training industrial
workers and soldiers.8
Some historians try to account for
Disneys participation in generating military propaganda by claiming that
the studios were "taken over by the military as part of the war effort"
9 on December 8, 1941.
But Richard Shale has meticulously documented
Disneys much earlier attempts to court contracts with the aircraft
industry, the U.S. Council of National Defense, and Canadian military
supporters.10
Indeed, despite a "popular (and frequently
quoted) misconception" that the relationship between Disney Studios and the
U.S. military was "unexpected or unsolicited," Shale observes an explicit
shift in Disneys focus from "entertainment values to teaching values" that
occurred before Disney acquired his first U.S. military contracts in
December 1941.11
For instance, in 1940 Disney approached the
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation with the idea of generating a training film on
flush riveting.
And in the spring of 1941, with Canada already
engaged in war, Disney convinced the commissioner of the National Film Board
of Canada, John Grierson, that animated films were better positioned
as teaching tools than documentary films because of their "capacity for
simplifying the presentation of pedagogical problems."12
Grierson then bought the Canadian rights to Four
Methods of Flush Riveting and commissioned Disney to produce an
instructional film that taught soldiers how to use an antitank rifle and
four short films that encouraged Canadians to purchase war savings
certificates.
Then, in the fall of 1941, Walt Disney toured South America at the bequest
of the U.S. Office of Inter-American affairs, which was attempting to
establish good relations and,
"hemispheric unity as explicated in
Roosevelts Good Neighbor policy."13
With material collected on the trip, Disney
proceeded to generate two feature films, Saludos Amigos (1943) and The Three
Caballeros (1945), both intended to celebrate Latin American culture while
accentuating its similarities with North American culture (and downplaying
or ignoring issues like national politics and poverty).14
Born out of U.S. fear of a Nazi alliance with
countries like Argentina, the films aimed to,
"enhance the Latin American image in the
United States," while also "enhanc[ing] Americas appreciation of Latin
American Everymen."15
Yet, in making The Three Caballeros palatable to
white Middle America and American imperialism less threatening to
southerners, Disney more often than not caricatures Latin American culture
as a voluptuous, exotic female who is fleeing the attentions of a
libidinous, but comically ineffectual Donald Duck.16
There is little doubt that a relationship
between Disney Studios and the U.S. government had been fully cemented by
1943, when 94 percent of the footage produced by Disney was under government
contract.17
From 1941 to 1945, the Disney Studios produced dozens of short educational
films, with their subjects ranging from aircraft and warship identification
to dental hygiene to the household conservation of cooking oil for the
making of military weapons.
The studio also produced a number of anti-Nazi
short films, including,
-
Der Fuehrers Face (1943)
-
Education for Death: The Making of the
Nazi (1943)
-
Reason and Emotion (1943),
...two of which were nominated for Academy
Awards.
In these shorts, Hitler is depicted as waging a
mind-control campaign over the German people based on the manipulation of
emotions such as anger, love, fear, sympathy, pride, and hate, while also
occasionally employing force, regimentation, depravation, and false rewards.
Of course, the success of the films efforts to
expose Nazi propaganda overwhelmingly relies on the use of comic devices,
caricatures, and stereotypes to make Hitler, Mussolini, and Hirohito seem
irrational and absurd.
Demonizing the enemy, according to Disney historian
Leonard Maltin, "relieves aggression."18
This claim, suggesting that the films function
to disperse rather than focus emotional energy, clearly sidesteps the
multiple ways in which the films, much like the propaganda they critique,
attempt to shape their audiences emotional responses, such as when Donald
Duck, clad in starred-and-striped pajamas, croons to the Statue of Liberty,
"Oh, boy, am I glad to be a citizen of the
United States of America!"
Most significant about the techniques used by
these Disney shorts is how they embody animations capacity to draw clear,
simple lines and present a selective representation of an otherwise complex
reality.
Through the use of comedy and comedic violence,
in particular, Disney films are often released from the expectation that
they might be attempting to do more than entertain. Viewers wooed by
animations unique capacity to create novel images through exaggeration,
distortion, and aesthetic style are easily absorbed into an imaginary world
that quite deliberately focuses their eyes on a constructed reality to the
exclusion of other possibilities.
The value of the anti-Nazi short films for
todays audiences lies in their obvious attempt to win the hearts and minds
of American viewers through clever visual and ideological manipulation,
while ironically issuing repeated warnings to viewers not to allow emotion
to short-circuit their critical faculties.
A historical perspective on the subject matter
sets in relief how Disneys critique of propaganda using the medium of
animation inevitably ventures into the realm of propaganda itself.
During the war, a significant number of the studios resources were devoted
to making another feature-length propaganda film, Victory through Air Power
(1943).
The film, based in part on a book written by
Major Alexander P. De Seversky, advocates the development of airplane and
weapons technology as the means to win the war against the Axis powers.
We
are told the airplane will not only,
"revolutionize warfare" but is "the only
weapon of war to develop such usefulness during peacetime."
Dramatic music
punctuates scenes that explore new models of airplanes with increased
bombing potential.
The United States as the "arsenal of democracy" is
represented as a giant heart comprising factories that pump "war supplies"
through "the arteries of our transport lines over distances that actually
girdle the globe."
This organic, humanizing image of "the great industrial
heart of America" contrasts with the mechanical image of a spoked wheel used
to represent the Nazi war industries, which are also vividly portrayed in
dark reds and blacks suggestive of a hellish inferno. Japan is represented
as a deadly, black octopus extending its "greedy tentacles" over its "stolen
empire."
We are told of the necessity for U.S. long-range bombers to strike
at "the heart and vitals of the beast."
With the lethal combination of the
"superior" American,
"science of aviation" and "science of demolition," the
"enemy lies hopelessly exposed to systematic destruction."
At the same time,
the film announces that "scientific bombing" will enable a "minimum
investment in human lives," an oddly ambiguous use of language suggestive of
two possible meanings in the context in which it appears:
the assertion that
aerial bombing of enemy territories requires a "minimum investment" of
American soldiers and, what is both more sinister and perhaps in need of
such coded language, the claim that bombing the enemy entails such "total
destruction" that no human lives requiring "investment" will be left in its
wake.
Indeed, the films climax consists of a montage of exploding bombs
among Japanese cities and factories, which begin curiously unpopulated and
end utterly annihilated.
At the pinnacle of the climactic violence, the
screen resolves into an image of a bald eagle descending upon and crushing
the land-ridden octopus, which then dissolves into a dark cloud of smoke
rising above Japan as "America the Beautiful" plays in the background.
Walt Disney believed that Victory through Air Power convinced President
Franklin D. Roosevelt to support to long-range bombing.19
For a contemporary
viewer who has the benefit of hindsight, the unquestioned propaganda offered
by Victory through Air Power leaves one with the eerie feeling that the
perspective being shaped by the film would not only fail to question the use
of technology such as the atomic bomb but even wholeheartedly celebrate it
as the quickest and most effective way to win the war.
Indeed, it is
precisely the films unflinching support of the development of bigger and
better bombing technology, from small hand-dropped bombs to ten-ton
delayed-action bombs and armor-piercing bomb rockets, that might seem most
disturbing given the devastating effects of the bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, as well as the postwar escalation of arms development during the
Cold War and the ongoing expansion of the military-industrial complex in the
United States.20
But Walt Disney did not just support the development of
larger weapons; he was a firm supporter of what might be called the atomic
age and made the classic 1956 propaganda film Our Friend the Atom, which was
also produced as a book and appeared as an atomic submarine ride in the Tomorrowland section of Disneys Magic Kingdom.
In this instance, as Mark
Langer points out, Our Friend the Atom was designed to "counter opposition
to the military use of atomic weaponry."21
The Magic Kingdom became an
outpost for leading young people and adults to believe that an,
"Atomic
reactor... is like a big furnace. An atomic chain reaction is likened to
what happens when a stray ping-pong ball is thrown at a mass of mousetraps
with ping-pong balls set on each one."22
Disney played a formidable role in
convincing every school child that atomic energy was central not merely to
winning the Cold War but also to preparing them for a future that would be
dominated by the United States and its use of new energy sources, which
incidentally could be instrumental in elevating the United States to the
position of the worlds preeminent military power.
Mouse power easily and
readily made the shift to celebrating atomic power and militarism while
enlarging Disneys role as a major purveyor of propaganda.
The Disney films discussed above alert us to the fact that Disney animators
honed their skills and gained widespread popular appeal in the 1940s by
first producing propaganda films for the U.S. government.
This often
neglected reality underlying Disneys origins as a cultural entertainment
icon should make us all the more careful to heed Janet Waskos warning that
Disney encodes preferred readings of both its animated films and its own
brand image to such an extent that,
"one of the most amazing aspects of the
Disney phenomenon is the consistently uniform understanding of the essence
of Disney."23
Attuned to Disneys willingness to assume an overt pedagogical role during
World War II, several critics of a more recent Disney film, Aladdin (1992),
noted that the timing of the films production and release coincided with
U.S. military efforts in the Persian Gulf war.
According to Christiane
Staninger, Aladdin is,
"a propaganda movie for Western imperialism" that
"shows the supposed unworkability of Middle Eastern traditions and the need
for American intervention."24
Dianne Sachko Macleod takes this critique a
step further, suggesting a link between Disneys,
"revival of British and
French colonial stereotypes of Arab traders, fanatics, and beauties" and the
"storehouse of racial and cultural images" used by the Pentagon to justify
the war.25
Macleod notes that regardless of the filmmakers intentions, the
film had the general effect of "privileging the American myths of freedom
and innocence at a time of nationalist fervor."26
Other connections between
the film and the first Iraq war are not especially subtle: in addition to
locating Aladdin in the fictional city of "Agrabah," it makes the villainous
Grand Vizier Jafar look like a combination of Saddam Hussein and the
Ayatollah Khomeini, while the two young heroes, Aladdin and Jasmine, not
only look American - Disney animators made it publicly known that Aladdin
was modeled after Tom Cruise 27 - but also, as Brenda Ayres suggests, display
their heroism by,
"contesting (and changing) Arabian law and Islamic
religious tradition."28
While it is impossible to discern the actual motives
of the Disney animators, it is equally impossible to ignore the cultural
context in which the American public viewed Aladdin.
At the time of the
films release, the dominant media were aggressively promoting similar
images of liberation from barbaric traditions in order to justify the United
States,
"right to intervene in Middle Eastern politics."29
Disney's Conservative
Path
Despite the well-documented history of collaboration between the Walt Disney
Company and U.S. military and state institutions, Disney has more recently
claimed to have no interest in politics.
How Disneys decision in May 2004
to block its Miramax division from distributing Michael Moores Fahrenheit
9/11 might qualify as a nonpolitical gesture is uncertain.
At the time, a
senior executive stated that,
"its not in the interest of any major
corporation to be dragged into a highly charged partisan political
battle."30
Not only were a number of Disneys top executives known to be
campaign contributors to the
George W. Bush administration,31 but then CEO
Michael Eisner was reported to have said that any criticism of the Bush
administration might,
"endanger tax breaks Disney receives for its theme
park, hotels and other ventures in Florida, where Mr. Bushs brother, Jeb,
is governor."32
Miramax arranged privately to buy Moores film and
distribute it independently, and in 2005, the founders of Miramax, Harvey
and Bob Weinstein, did not renew their contracts with Disney.33
As suggested above, the companys alleged desire to remain outside politics
contradicts the reality of Disneys historical pattern of intervening in
political matters. It is hardly surprising, then, that in the wake of the
unprecedented success of Moores
Fahrenheit 9/11 documentary, Disney/ABC
decided to produce its own account of the events leading up to the terrorist
attacks on September 11, 2001.
A $40 million miniseries titled The Path to
9/11, originally touted as a docudrama "based on the 9/11 Commission Report"
and later as the "official true story," constituted a blatant political move
on the part of Disney/ABC.34
In addition, Scholastic, Inc., the educational
distribution partner for Disney/ABC, sent one hundred thousand letters to
high school teachers across the United States encouraging them to use The
Path to 9/11 in the classroom curriculum and directing them to online study
guides.35
The miniseries was billed by its self-labeled conservative writer Cyrus Nowrasteh as an "objective telling of the events of 9/11" 36 but faced severe
criticism for its partisan depiction of events and actors.
The Path to 9/11,
directed by evangelical Christian filmmaker David Cunningham,37 depicted
members of the Bill Clinton administration as totally incompetent, having
repeatedly ignored opportunities to capture Osama bin Laden and overlooked
warnings of an incipient attack before September 11, 2001.
When prescreened
to a select number of film reviewers before it aired on television, the
miniseries was received with skepticism and outrage, not merely from
Democrats and Clinton supporters.
Robert Cressey, a top counterterrorism
official to both the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, argued that
a scene depicting the Clinton administrations refusal to pursue bin Laden
was,
"something straight out of Disney and fantasyland. Its factually wrong.
And thats shameful."38
Nearly one hundred thousand readers of the online
journal Think Progress sent protest letters to Robert Iger, president and
CEO of the Walt Disney Company, stating that the film inaccurately,
"places
primary responsibility for the attacks of 9/11 on the Clinton administration
while whitewashing the failures of the Bush administration."39
According to
Tom Shales, writing for the Washington Post, the miniseries qualified as an
"assault on truth."40
Shales added,
"Blunderingly, ABC executives cast doubt
on their own films veracity when they made advance copies available to such
political conservatives as Rush Limbaugh but not to Democrats who reportedly
requested the same treatment... Democrats have a right to be suspicious
of any product of the conservative-minded Walt Disney Co."41
A group of
academic historians led by Arthur M. Schlesinger sent a letter to ABC
calling for the network to,
"halt the shows broadcast and prevent
misinforming Americans about their history."42
The film presents a number of clichéd stereotypes of "big government" and
bureaucratic incompetence, depicting paper-pushing officials as woefully
indecisive at crucial moments, primarily because they are too
self-interested to put their necks on the line.
Clinton, for example, is
represented as not wanting to issue orders for military action against
al-Qaeda because hes too worried about the effect such decisions might have
on the polls, that is, when he is not caught up in dealing with the fallout
from the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
In one scene, General Ahmad Shah Massoud,
leader of the Afghan Northern Alliance, which waits for U.S. approval to go
after bin Laden, asks in a scornful tone,
"Are there any men left in
Washington?"
Individuals working on the ground who buck procedure and orders
from their superiors are, by contrast, willing to "take the heat."
So,
apparently, is
George W. Bush, whose decisiveness in giving a strike-down
order to the military after the 9/11 attacks really functions as the climax
of the whole miniseries. One could imagine Bush political supporters
cheering as this scene unfolded: finally, they could rest assured that there
was a real man in Washington.
Meanwhile, several FBI and U.S. customs agents
recognize the nature of the "new kind of war" being waged against America,
and their appeals to racial profiling and domestic spying appear justified
in the film.
For example, in a brief dialogue, one FBI agent states,
"Americans have the right to be protected from domestic spying," and the
central protagonist of the film, FBI counterterrorism agent John ONeil
(portrayed by Harvey Keitel), replies, "Do they have the right to be killed
by terrorists?"
Heroic individuals such as ONeil are willing to bypass "red
tape" and stand in stark contrast to,
-
politicians who are too worried
about public opinion not to bow to the pressures of "political correctness"
-
uncooperative CIA officials who jealously guard intelligence when they
are not mindlessly adhering to obsolete federal legislation that protects
individuals rights
-
various utterly casual security officials and
workers who would rather appease suspicious-looking members of the public
than be confronted with a situation that might embroil them in conflict
And
that is not all.
The film contrasts the coolness of John ONeils astute
judgments with the irrationality of emotionally overwrought women, such as
the ambassador to Yemen, Barbara Bodine (Patricia Heaton), and the fanatic
zeal of the terrorists.
In fact, many of the characters who represent
terrorists such as Mohamed Atta (Martin Brody) and Ramzi Yousef (Nabil
Elouahabi) share the same intense stare, bristly mustache, and swarthy skin
exhibited by Hitler in Disneys World War II propaganda films.
While it
might be possible for a viewer to overlook insipid dialogue, fallacious
logic, melodrama, and weak narrative structure, it is virtually impossible
to ignore the films use of racist and sexist stereotypes to lend legitimacy
to all the standard bogeys of extreme right-wing ideology. And, most
importantly, there remains the films utterly deceptive self-presentation as
a historically accurate depiction of events.
Even lead actor Harvey Keitel
told a CNN interviewer prior to the airing of the miniseries,
I had questions about certain events - material I was given in
The Path to
9/11 that I did raise questions about... Not all the facts were correct.
. . . You cannot cross the line from a conflation of events to a distortion
of the event. No. Where we have distorted something, we made a mistake, and
that should be corrected. It can be corrected, by the people getting
involved in the story that they are going to see.43
In response to the controversy surrounding The Path to 9/11, Scholastic,
Inc., announced that its online study guide did not meet the companys "high
standards for dealing with controversial issues" and would be replaced with
new materials that would focus more on media literacy and critical
thinking.44
ABC also responded to protests by broadcasting disclaimers about
the miniseriess "fictionalized" representation while airing a minimally
reedited version on September 10 and 11, 2006. But ABCs rather inexplicable
decision to air the broadcast without commercials - entailing a loss of $40
million45 - fostered an illusion of the films closer proximity to real
life, if not also conveying the impression that it was a public service
announcement.
Most significantly, the broadcast that aired on the second
night was framed by a strategic interruption - George W. Bushs Address to
the Nation - prompting one journalist to note the "thematic synchronicity,"
as the presidents speech called for ongoing support for the war on
terror.46
It is difficult to deny the political synergy suggested by the
combination of the rightwing The Path to 9/11 and Bushs speech - synergy
being a profit-driven marketing strategy by no means unfamiliar to a
mega-corporation like Disney 47 - as Bush appealed to Americans to recognize
the ongoing threat of terrorism and the necessity of preemptive action as
the only way to safeguard,
"advancing freedom and democracy as the great
alternatives to repression and radicalism."48
When placed in the context of
the film, Bushs success could be measured in terms of how the post9/11
decisions made by his government succeeded where Clintons administration
apparently had failed.
Furthermore, the timely juxtaposition allowed the
film to gain a greater veneer of authenticity from the speechs presentation
of topical and really existing political concerns, while the film in turn
provided credible images and points of reference for listeners trying to
engage the highly rhetorical, often self-referential use of language
characteristic of Bushs speech.
Additionally, the blurring of fact and
fiction embodied by the film lent to the speech the mythic or symbolic power
generated by extended narrative, and the grandeur of the presidential
address added authority to the film.
As a context for Bushs speech, The Path to 9/11 made an effort to point out
some of the problems in law enforcement and governance that preceded the
terrorist attacks of 9/11, but the nature of the critique - although
presented as objective and all encompassing - never rises above criticizing
particular individuals for their character failings.
The film was cleverer,
however, in the way it indicated the supposed gaps in the system and
advocated taking a hard line, but offered no concrete alternatives. In doing
so, the film left it to Bush to emerge as the ultimate hero, opening up a
space for a timely description of the measures instituted since 9/11:
Weve created the Department of Homeland Security. We have torn down the
wall that kept law enforcement and intelligence from sharing information.
Weve tightened security at our airports and seaports and borders, and weve
created new programs to monitor enemy bank records and phone calls.
Thanks
to the hard work of our law enforcement and intelligence professionals, we
have broken up terrorist cells in our midst and saved American lives.49
If The Path to 9/11 presented a single narrative perspective (the "path"
taken) as the infallible "truth," then Bushs speech, with a similar kind of
religious confidence, also took for granted that only one predetermined
course could secure the nation from the terrorist threat. At no point did
the film or Bushs speech suggest that the situation was complex enough to
necessitate the consideration of several possible paths; indeed, both
narratives closed off the possibility of questioning the effectiveness of
the security measures endorsed and instituted.
Difficult questions - such as
the extent to which freedom should be limited in order to be secured or the
kinds of sacrifices entailed by "national security" - were simply ignored in
favor of the message that Americans must do whatever it takes to defeat the
"enemy."
It is hard to believe that the gross trivializations of the complex
issues surrounding terrorism and the war in Iraq in The Path to 9/11 and
Bushs address could almost escape public protest only five years after the
horrifying events of September 11, 2001.
One notable exception to the general complaisance with which the public
received The Path to 9/11 involved a group of students at Ithaca College who
protested the colleges acceptance of a private donation from Robert Iger on
the grounds that The Path to 9/11, touted as a docudrama, was actually an
egregious display of media bias.
Students argued that,
"accepting Disney
money would send the wrong message about the importance of objectivity to
the schools journalism and communications students."50
Although a Disney
spokesperson responded to the student protesters by calling them,
"people who
cant distinguish between fact and fiction," Ithaca College president Peggy
R. Williams lent credence to the students concerns by reassuring them that Igers donation "does not buy Disney any influence on campus... Our
curriculum decisions are our own."51
Although certainly admitting no
wrongdoing, Disney has uncharacteristically and tellingly opted not to sell
The Path to 9/11 on DVD - defying the expectations of both those who assumed
the company would try to recover the costs of making the miniseries and
vociferous right-wing groups who continue to support the films
representation of the events leading to 9/11.52
The National
Security-Family - Meet The Incredibles
As films like Aladdin and The Path to 9/11 suggest, the Walt Disney Company
has an impressive ability to revise more or less familiar stories, updating
the issues to make them resonate in peoples lives at the current moment.
It
is how Disney offers audiences not simply escape but also a mode of relating
to the real conditions of their existence that makes Disney films such a
long-lived and potent force in U.S. and global popular culture.
As Louis
Marin suggests regarding the powerful cultural role of Disney theme parks,
Disney represents both,
"what is estranged and what is familiar: comfort,
welfare, consumption, scientific and technological progress, superpower, and
morality."
Importantly, Marin adds,
"These are values obtained by violence
and exploitation; [in Disney culture] they are projected under the auspices
of law and order."53
Marins framework is especially useful for
understanding a film such as The Incredibles as mediating the,
"imaginary
relationship that the dominant groups of American society maintain with
their real conditions of existence, with the real history of the United
States, and with the space outside of its border."54
In a post-9/11 world,
Academy Award winner The Incredibles brings home the need not only to
reclaim "superpower" identity as a quintessential American quality but also
to recognize that American soil is not immune to the threat of violent
attacks.
In response to the forces threatening America - internally, the
weakening of superhero resolve in the face of excessive bureaucracy, public
cynicism, and unthinking adherence to the law; externally, enemies whose
infantile resentment at being "not super" results in a genocidal campaign
against everything "super," even to the extent of terrorizing an innocent
public - the PG-rated film sanctions violence as a means to establish a new
brand of "law and order."
Although hearkening back to the nuclear family as
the source of Americas security and strength, the film diverges from past
narratives in its emphasis on a natural order in which authority and power
belong in the hands of the few strong leaders left in America, while the
rest of us must duly recognize our inevitable "mediocrity."
This overall
message is especially disturbing in light of the events following 9/11, when
the United States witnessed a growing authoritarianism throughout the larger
culture.55
Some consequences of the American response to the tragic
terrorist attacks have been a general tolerance for the use of preemptive
violence and coercion, control of the media, the rise of repressive state
power, an expanding militarization, and a thriving surveillance and security
industry that is now even welcomed in public schools. And these are only
some of the known consequences: many of the effects of the Bush
administrations policies are still coming to light.
In 2009, President
Barack Obama ordered the release of top-secret Bush administration memos
that sanctioned the CIAs use of torture on terror suspects.
A year
previous, New York Times reporter David Barstow wrote an exposé of
"independent" military analysts who appeared on television networks to
inform the public with their expert and objective impressions of the war in
Iraq (many were retired army generals and had direct ties to corporations
that were courting government military contracts).
It turned out the
Pentagon was coaching the military analysts behind the scenes to put a
favorable spin on the Bush administrations "wartime performance," with the
apparent collusion of U.S. media networks, including ABC, which failed to
check for, or simply ignored, evident conflicts of interest.56
In addition
to calling into question the journalistic integrity of the media, the
scandal made it seem as if the Bush administrations public relations
machine was taking its cues from corporations such as Disney by not only
launching a marketing campaign carefully tailored to uphold its public image
but also secretly controlling access to information and limiting public
discourse, all in order to sell a sense of security to the American people.
An emphasis on controlling public speech and public spaces - not to mention
autocratic rule, secrecy, and the appeal to security - is nothing new to
Disney, whose theme parks, according to Steven Watts,
"blur the line between
fantasy and reality by immersing visitors in a totally controlled
environment."57
Disneyland is a useful space, apparently, to undertake
surveillance, and Walt Disney offered the FBI,
"complete access" to
Disneyland facilities in the 1950s for "use in connection with official
matters and for recreational purposes."58
Indeed, the development of a
cordial relationship between Walt Disney and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover is
now better understood not only in relation to Walt Disneys fervent
anticommunism but also in light of revelations that he may have served as,
"a
secret informer for the Los Angeles office of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation."59
Certainly, as Watts indicates, it is known that Disney was
appointed a special FBI agent in part because of his desire to root out
so-called communist agitators from the film industry.60
More recently, Eric Smoodin notes that the Disney corporation remains "interested in
constructing surveillance as entertainment," as suggested by the marketing
of products such as a Mickey Mouse doll with glow-in-the-dark eyes that
illuminate sleeping children for the benefit of parental scrutiny.61
The Incredibles, with its complex appeal to several levels of audience,
received overwhelming praise from film critics, who admired not only its
retromodern aesthetic and detailed animation but also its "stinging wit."62
However, most reviewers who observed an "edge of intellectual indignation"63
focused on the first thirty minutes of the film in which the main character,
Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson), is forced to conceal his
superhero identity as a consequence of public disaffection and a string of
lawsuits (he is sued after rescuing a suicidal man named Sansweet who
claimed Mr. Incredible had "ruined [his] death").
With "average citizens"
now proclaiming they want "average heroes," Mr. Incredible; his superhero
wife, Elastigirl/Helen (Holly Hunter); and their children become the
middle-of-the-road Parr family, trying to maintain a normal suburban
lifestyle by suppressing their superpowers in what one reviewer suggests is
a "suspicious society thats decidedly below-Parr."64
As suggested by a
Boston Globe film review, Bob Parrs cubicle office job as a claims adjuster
at Insuricare is designed to evoke identification with the "middle-age blues
felt by audience members."65
But many reviewers, in choosing to highlight
the films critique of suburban conformity and corporate greed, misread or
overlook the films central message, which does not elicit identification on
the part of a mere newspaper journalist or academician: in fact, normal
people who wrongly identify with superheroes and devalue their worth are
societys worst threat.
The films villain, Buddy aka Syndrome (Jason Lee),
begins as Mr. Incredibles "number one fan" but then transgresses the
boundary between admiration and emulation. Conflict arises when Buddy
asserts that his rocket boot technology enables him "to be super" without
being born with superpowers.
When rejected by Mr. Incredible, who prefers to
"work alone," Buddy turns the pathological injury into villainy with an
ideological goal: to provide the technology,
"so that everyone can be
superheroes... And when everyones super, no one will be."
The
connections between Buddy and the dominant medias portrayal of
international terrorists are multiple: his fixation on demolishing a
superpower, his development of high-tech weaponry, his narcissistic rage, his
ideological purpose, and, what resonates most clearly, his plan to gain
power over a fearful public by launching a plane at Manhattan.
At one point,
Buddy even tells Mr. Incredible,
"Now you respect me, because Im a threat... It turns out theres a lot of people, whole countries, who want
respect. And they will pay through the nose to get it."
Given the films
resounding judgment of Buddy/Syndrome - he is shredded by a jet turbine
while attempting to kidnap the Parr baby - it is difficult to understand how
the films message could be interpreted, as one reviewer suggests, as
empowering viewers to recognize the,
"secret identities we all keep tucked
away in our hearts."66
Even if one were to extend an allegorical reading of
The Incredibles to argue that all Americans are super, it would not be
possible to elide the films clear validation of a social hierarchy along
primordial lines.
Throughout the film, the plight of the super family is closely linked to
their superiority. The Incredibles son Dash (Spencer Fox), frustrated by
not being able to demonstrate his speed in school sports competitions, acts
out in his fourth-grade class by playing pranks on his teacher.
Dash wins
his fathers admiration, but the thought of a graduation ceremony for
fourth-graders leads Mr. Incredible to burst out,
"Its psychotic! They keep
creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity, but if someone is genuinely
exceptional..."
Later in the film, Elastigirl reassures daughter Violet
(Sarah Vowell),
"Your identity is your most valuable possession... Doubt
is a luxury we cant afford anymore. You have more power than you realize.
Dont think. Dont worry. If the time comes, youll know what to do. Its in
your blood."
As A.O. Scott astutely recognizes in a New York Times review,
the movie argues,
"Some people have powers that others do not, and to deny
them the right to exercise those powers, or the privileges that accompany
them, is misguided, cruel and socially destructive."67
Being "super" in such
a framework does not mean being smart or being virtuous; it simply means
possessing innate power.
The highly advanced modern society produces
mediocrity because its ethics (a belief in social justice and equality)
counter the effects of natural selection by nullifying Darwinian fitness as
the condition for survival.
If the film indeed offers up "the philosophy of Ayn Rand" - who opposed
collectivism, altruism, and the welfare state in favor of egoistic
individualism - then it turns to violence as the means to achieve
supremacy.68
At no point during The Incredibles "eardrum-bashing,
metal-crunching action sludge" and its self-referential mockery of "monologuing"
does the film suggest that reasoning, discussion, or any other form of
peaceful resolution might be pursued instead of violence. More in keeping,
however, with Disney conventions than Rands philosophy is the films
conflation of the pursuit of individualism with the protection of the
nuclear family.
One reviewer cleverly summarizes the films main theme as
"the family that slays together stays together."69
In this way, the white,
nuclear, middle-class family becomes the ethical referent for a bombproof
collectivity:
only a muscular protection of ones own will ensure stability,
identity, and agency, not to mention consumerism, heterosexuality, clearly
defined gender roles, parenthood, and class chivalry.
The result is that the
film brings,
"individuals and their families to the centers of national life,
offering the audience an image of itself and of the nation as a knowable
community, a wider public world beyond the routines of a narrow
existence."70
But the American nation drawn by the film is imaged as one
that neither shies away from use of force nor requires any justification for
its display of blatant chauvinism when confronted by others.
The Incredibles further contrasts the banality of suburban life with the
glamour and excitement of "hero work."
The elaborate security compounds of
Syndromes island and the home of fashion designer Edna Mode (Brad Bird) are suped up with the latest high-tech gadgetry, the exhilarating navigation of
which bears a close resemblance to video game playing, particularly in the
medium of computer-generated animation.
And even if the filmmakers intended
to parody gated homes à la Hollywood Hills in their representation of Edna
Modes mansion, the cumulative message makes security and surveillance
systems seem not only unthreatening but also quite normal - at least as
familiar as, say, the presence of gates and cameras at Walt Disney World.
In
fact, Syndromes island has a developed monorail system, which implies a
double reference both to the James Bond movie Dr. No (1962) and to Disney
World itself.
Referentiality seems to come full circle as The Incredibles
island imitates Bond films that likely drew on the model of Disney theme
parks in portraying the villains lair.
For instance, Bonds antagonist in
The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) "inhabits a politically autonomous island
that features an amusement park funhouse,"71 an allusion that betrays
cultural anxiety about a rigidly controlled theme park environment governed
by an autocrat who deliberately toys with defenseless peoples perceptions
and plays upon their fears.
The Bond films were tapping into a darker side
of the Disney-designed spaces, also noted by M. Keith Booker, who writes,
"The fictional utopias portrayed in the [Disney] parks have a definite
dystopian side, as anyone who has ever been bothered by the efficiency with
which the parks are able to control and manipulate the vast populations who
visit them has noticed."72
Yet, the lush tropical island in The Incredibles
works less to expose the dark side of a totally regulated world than to
associate it with exotic thrills and gamelike suspense as the superheroes
infiltrate Syndromes compound - a brilliant advertisement for a family
adventure at Walt Disney World, if there ever was one.
More disturbing is
the recognition that as dominant culture in the United States accepts the
expansion of a security-military-surveillance-intelligence complex,
negotiating such altered environments can be reduced to slapstick comedy
(when, for instance, Elastigirl finds herself stretched between two security
doors and must fight against a number of armed guards).
Not rendered
entirely harmless, the island environment also represents the ideal locale
for the Incredible children to rise to the challenge of a real danger -
their mother tells them that unlike "the bad guys" on "Saturday morning
cartoons... these guys will kill you" - and to engage the enemy in a
display of family loyalty and heroic exceptionalism.
Because,
"calls to action litter the film," critics such as David Hastings
Dunn have suggested that The Incredibles is "an allegorical tale justifying
U.S. foreign policy under George W. Bush."73
Indeed, the only imaginable way
the "slightly fascist" Incredibles could be labeled a "family-friendly
film,"74 as one critic claims, is if one assumes the "super" refrain
throughout the film is an oblique reference to American superiority and
supremacy, such that viewers are included as part of one big national
family, a family that has recently demonstrated its mettle on the world
stage by waging wars against Afghanistan and Iraq.
Indeed, Mr. Incredible
repeatedly argues for an ethic of intervention and pushes aside anyone who
poses an obstacle to action.
Those individuals who wish to prevent
superheroes from acting are fundamentally weak: people who claim their right
to noninterference, politicians who cravenly seek public approval, lawyers
who succumb to financial pressures, teachers who suppress any challenges to
their authority, and employers who expect blind obedience to corporate
policy.
Interventionism is legitimated when Bob/Mr. Incredible helps an
elderly woman with her insurance claim, only to face his irate boss, who
indicates that Bobs loyalties must be redirected to one specific purpose:
"Help our people! Starting with our stockholders."
While the diminutive Mr. Huph (Wallace Shawn) launches into a speech about the necessity for the
"little cogs" in the company machine to "mesh together," Mr. Incredible is
prevented from saving a man in the street who is being mugged.
The film
deserves credit for extending a clichéd critique of office work as crushing
of individual creativity to a representation of greed and corruption
plaguing private corporations charged with providing public services.
Unfortunately, the only solution to the social ills of exploitation and
dehumanization proffered by the film is to put ones faith in the
individuals who have the power to subjugate a clear and unambiguous enemy,
in other words, a militaristic version of the old adage "Father knows best."
Before we join the throngs of enthusiastic reviewers who laud the film for
its exposure of corporate abuses of power, it should be understood that the
film is as much invested in showing how postindustrial capitalism - and
liberal democracy even more so - elevates the weak manipulators above the
authentic strongmen.
Instead of presenting a viable solution to the ravages
of neoliberal economics on social democracy, The Incredibles offers only one
reactionary alternative devised in the realm of fantasy:
superheroes will
save us as long as we recognize our natural inferiority and give them our
unqualified vote of confidence.
The huge, hard-bodied Mr. Incredible is
ready to rescue America from the city slicker, ladies man softness of the
postwar era.
(Admittedly, this superhero for a "post-feminist" generation has
an exceedingly competent female sidekick/wife, but one who tellingly
possesses the complementary superhero power of extreme malleability).
When considered alongside the blockbuster success of The Incredibles and its
overarching message in 2004, it probably should not surprise us that George
W. Bush was reelected the same year - in part because his public relations
team managed to convince voters that, in an insecure world rife with
terrorist threats, they should depend on his uncompromising judgments of
good and evil, his impervious cowboylike manner, and his "strong, stable
personality."
What makes The Incredibles appear to be superheroes is the
same quality that apparently made George W. Bush seem presidential: the
ability to act free from the paralyzing effects of thoughtful consideration.
This orientation toward decisive action in the film becomes an end in itself
since, as Jeremy Heilman points out,
"There are no scenes in which
characters learn to use their power responsibly (except for those that extol
conformity), and no moments in which loss of life is felt."75
According to George Soros, the events of 9/11 renewed a "distorted view" of
American supremacy that,
"postulates that because we are stronger than
others, we must know better and we must have right on our side."76
If
American patriotism reached a fever pitch in the aftermath of 9/11, then The Incredibles clearly tapped into a desire to assert U.S. preeminence on the
world stage. Indeed, all the superheroes are American, and the only
non-American with any power is a villainous French mime named Bomb Voyage.
The overall message of the film, as Hastings Dunn points out, is a perennial
neoconservative theme:
"Americas failure to spread its values can lead to
blowback from former clients and protégés."77
The only response offered by the film to a
society supposedly weakened by a misguided egalitarianism and the postCold
War softening of American resolve is to minimize institutional
and legal controls while letting unrestrained power achieve its deserved
place of domination.
For "supers" to dictate the common good once again, The Incredibles concludes,
"its up to the politicians."
It is difficult to
imagine a more resounding dismissal of democratic processes than this final
assertion, suggesting less the need for political accountability and public
participation than the need for emboldened leaders whose decisive action
should be divorced from the values and constraints imposed by the mediocre
masses.
Disney and the
Rhetoric of Innocence
The bizarre way in which The Incredibles marries two dangerous social ideals
- a Darwinist notion of survival of the fittest and a retrograde identity
politics based on biological superiority - can verge on acceptability when
it is packaged as a Disney animated film that carries the overarching
association with childhood innocence.
Audiences are meant to appreciate the
fact that if in a fit of rage Mr. Incredible destroys a car, or another
human being for that matter, then it is simply a natural expression of his
innate "super" identity and not something that requires moral assessment.
Or, worse yet, it is something that can only be considered as intrinsically
good.
By appealing to the view that "might is right," the film fails to open
up the possibility that values and ethics are constituted by various social
mechanisms and material relations of power. Instead, the tautological
rationale suggests that being "right" is simply entailed by being "super,"
such that the imperative to conquer the enemy who threatens ones way of
life remains not only above question but also without any negative
consequences (after all, the enemy is not "super" like us).
The presumption
of innate American benevolence is implied by a reading of The Incredibles as
a national allegory. At stake in this concept of America as a superpower is
the belief that its leaders and the entire populace are incorruptible and
therefore exemplify absolute goodness.78
As we have seen in previous chapters, this notion of a benign, incorruptible
nature is nothing new to Disney, whose cultural productions rely on
innocence as a rhetorical tool to legitimate dominant relations of power.
The Incredibles slightly modifies the concept of childhood innocence by
linking it to a citizenry in need of a blameless and absolute paternalistic
authority to safeguard its interests.
The appeal to innocence often enables
animated Disney films to fly below a critical radar.
The Incredibles
probably does so, despite its authoritarian overtones, because of the
historical and cultural context in which it was received. After the tragic
events of 9/11, Americans sought an opportunity to envision themselves as
proactive agents of history rather than its passive victims and as part of a
community with strong leadership that could instill hope for security and
redemption in a world that seemed hostile to such desires.
However, when politics is cloaked in the guise of innocence, more is at
stake than a simple affirmation of desire.
At stake is the way in which
Disney films garner the cultural power to influence how people think not
simply through their particular mode of representation but also through
shaping the knowledge and subjectivities of their viewers in order to
valorize some identities while disabling others.
Film watching involves more
than entertainment; it is an experience that reproduces the basic conditions
of learning. To understand Disney films, we need to understand how Disney
culture influences public understandings of history, national coherence, and
popular values in ways that often conceal injustice, dissent, and the
possibility of democratic renewal.
While the retro style and clever
allusiveness of The Incredibles appeal to what is aesthetically pleasing
about Americas past, there is no acknowledgment of an underlying
totalitarian ethos driving, for instance, U.S. military and imperial
expansion during the Cold War.
Although weakling institutions and
individuals hinder all things "super," Mr. Incredible, as an exemplary
cultural icon, enables the reconstruction of American history purged of its
seamy side, not least of all through an appeal to nostalgia, stylized
consumption, and a reinvigorated patriotism. Moreover, The Incredibles
comic representation of 1950s suburban mediocrity does little to challenge
the prevailing discourses of patriarchy, class, and sexism.
In fact, the
film pays tribute to the consumerism, patriarchy, and family values
associated with 1950s sitcoms by suggesting that the failing of such a
family orientation lies not in its oppressive control but in how settling
into a mundane reality and accepting the onset of complacency sap its
inherent magisterial vitality.
Taking what it considers best from that era,
the film revitalizes conservative ideology for a new generation of
video-gaming kids, sexing up the suburban doldrums with designer superhero
garb and high-tech stunts that substitute spectacle for critical engagement.
The Incredibles and The Path to 9/11 are films produced at a particular
historical moment that share the theme of defending U.S. hegemony and values
against the insidious forces of a weak-willed political correctness at home
and envious terrorists determined to destroy the American way of life
abroad. One interesting outcome of the comparison can be seen in the way the
different film genres elicited much different responses from the public
despite their thematic similarities.
The Path to 9/11s claim to portray
historical events objectively in the form of a documentary-style ABC
miniseries drew some public resistance, whereas the animated Disney film
whose very representation defies objectivity drew virtually none.
But the
messages of The Incredibles are no less persuasive for being more fantastic.
Clearly, The Incredibles inscription of biological supremacy represents not
only an assertion of dominant family values but an ideological justification
for gender and race-based conceptions of U.S. global imperialism and national
identity. The Path to 9/11 is less clever in concealing its affirmation of
racist and sexist attitudes and its legitimation of violence, but The Incredibles is far more dangerous in that it has been viewed in a generally
unfiltered manner by millions of children and adults worldwide.
Recognizing
the conservative influence of Disney films - a conservatism that manifests
with unprecedented boldness in The Incredibles - should not entail avoiding
them, suppressing them, or complacently accepting their cultural ascendancy.
It should involve making explicit how and what we learn from the very
political messages being taught by Disney films, rather than accepting them
at face value or dismissing their existence altogether.
Consuming culture even as a form of entertainment is fundamentally a
pedagogical experience, and the more educators, parents, students, and other
cultural workers become active in their attempts to decode the complex
representations being offered by Disney, the more rich and rewarding our
experiences with popular culture will become.
For this reason, a nuanced
criticism of Disney films would not assume that they inherently disempower
the audience but would instead view such cultural encounters as
opportunities that can empower children and adults by creating the
conditions that give people control over the production and types of
knowledge and values arising from their experiences as cultural consumers.
Being resisted here is the attitude that turns Disneys native utopianism
into an excuse to adopt a stance that willfully overlooks the risks incurred
by allowing a multinational corporation to escape any critical scrutiny as
it reproduces dominant forms of identity, authorizes particular forms of
history, and validates,
"hierarchies of value as universally valid,
ecumenical, and effectively consensual."79
Nothing could be more dystopian
in its consequences than the abdication of our responsibility to be critical
and thoughtful of the ways the U.S. media represents America to itself and
others.
Disney should not be allowed to dictate, limit, and monopolize the
only current and future possibilities imaginable for an increasingly global
culture that must be able to imagine a better life - a life built upon the
precepts of compassion and justice rather than American-centered images of
power, nostalgia, insularity, and world domination.

47. Michael Eisner once conveyed the corporate idea of synergy in the
statement: The Disney stores promote the consumer products, which
promote the theme parks, which promote the TV shows. The TV shows
promote the company. Mike Budd defines Disney synergy as the process
through which every Disney product [exists as] both a commodity and an
ad for every other Disney commodity, in Rethinking Disney: Private
Control, Public Dimensions, ed. Mike Budd and Max H. Kirsch (Middletown,
CT: Wesleyan University Press, 2005), 1. For another discussion of
synergy, see Frank Roost, Synergy City: How Times Square and
Celebration Are Integrated into Disneys Marketing Cycle, in Rethinking
