The
Federal Reserve has been at the top of the news for a long time
and its getting a lot of attention now as it appears the next down cycle in
the depression may be upon us.
So whats the real reason the world listens so
intently to an Ivy League bureaucrat like Bernanke? Of course, it has
nothing to do with him.
Its who he is accountable to the
international banking cartel:
US
Bank of America Securities LLC
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
Goldman, Sachs & Co.
Jefferies & Company, Inc.
J. P. Morgan Securities Inc.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.
Britain
Barclays Capital Inc.
HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.
Switzerland
Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
LLC
UBS Securities LLC.
Japan
Daiwa Capital Markets America
Inc.
Mizuho Securities USA Inc.
Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Germany
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
France
BNP Paribas Securities Corp.
Canada
RBC Capital Markets Corp.
Scotland
RBS Securities Inc.
These institutions are the current primary
dealers of
the Federal Reserve System.
They have power over the entire economy,
everything in the market, very much a non-free market. They sit at the top
of the worlds monetary system, currently the FEDs debt-dollar pyramid,
with a governmental license to what has been the most secure capital in the
world - US Treasury debt - for a monopoly price that nobody else can get.
And when it comes to global finance, the
difference between the strongest banks vs. dying banks is just a few
basis points in price (cost of capital).
These banks get first dibs on buying the servitude of the US population
through the FED/Treasury auction process. They distribute some of it to
subordinate capital for a guaranteed premium, and they park a large amount
of it on their own balance sheets as assets upon which they can speculate,
trade, and fractionalize to create the rest of the money in the economy and
put other countries, companies, and people in even more debt.
So these institutions hold a monopoly position
that even leviathan Standard Oil never dreamed of:
a government-enforced usury license
that generates trillions for their premium capital holders and senior
employees and allows them to act as imperial armies sucking in more
territory around the world as neoliberalism breaks down sovereignty.
This is why the country list above doesnt mean
what some may think. The institutions arent national.
The list only indicates that the banking
establishment has a permanent parasitic stake in those countries to churn
their populations under the FEDs debt system. All of the listed
institutions are global in nature.
Together with
hedge funds and their other buy-side
buddies, they have power over nations. Like any corporate institution, banks
drive earnings per share (EPS) by expanding and leveraging their balance
sheets, which for banks means putting everything else in more debt. So these
cartel banks work to expand their territorial control beyond their national
borders to put other populations in debt.
This is a mathematical requirement of
exponential growth enforced by the private capital system.
The eventual end state of this dynamic is one
integrated, global banking empire. Its only a matter of time before their
collective balance sheets (plus the large Chinese banks now that the cartel
is colluding with them) control the rest of the world if people dont
awaken and choose to put a stop to it.
Will they succeed? The FED system is in transition.
The
crash
of 2008 was the first phase of global capital holders shifting
their private capital out of the system so the FED was forced to add public
capital, i.e. your debt, into the system. More of this is likely coming.
But does this mean the international banks
behind the FED are dying? No. Theyve simply transferred their bad assets to
the public through the FED and prepared to ramp up operations in Asia, which
will be a primary churn center for the 21st century
global banking system.
Capital assets have been transferred, production
assets have been transferred, and the capital holders can transfer much more
capital in a short period of time if they so choose.
All the specifics of this coming transition may not be clear, but it is
coming unless the global population says no. The banks have
set up the ultimate voluntary test.
If we continue to say yes by playing
along with the banks and the multinational corporations they control, then
they will have proven that a global empire ruled by an integrated banking
system is preferred and possibly superior to independent countries. But they
appear to be failing their own test.
Ivy League neoliberalism has been exposed
for what it is.
The people are now indeed saying no.
