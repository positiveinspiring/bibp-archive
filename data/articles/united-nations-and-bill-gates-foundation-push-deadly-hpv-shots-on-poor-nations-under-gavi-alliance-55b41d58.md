A new campaign has been launched by an organization known as
the GAVI
Alliance to vaccinate up to 2 million women and girls with either
GlaxoSmithKlines
Cervarix or Mercks
Gardasil by the year 2015.
Of course
these two
HPV shots have been shown to be very dangerous, with
Gardasil
linked to death, countless adverse reactions, and
Cervarix recently outed as
similarly threatening.
Nine countries are candidates for the HPV vaccine campaign, though they are
not listed at this time. In addition, the price of the campaign is not being
disclosed due to the sensitive nature of the price talks.
Why would an organization supposedly dedicated to enhancing health worldwide
push either HPV shot on up to 2 million women and young girls?
Considering HPV results in only 1% of cancers, and has a
90% chance to resolve itself
within two years, it does not seem worth the dangerous side effects and
countless millions that will be spent on the upcoming campaign.
GAVI Alliance funded
by UN, vaccine industry, Monsanto investor Bill Gates
The GAVI Alliance, a name relatively unknown to many, is a Geneva-based
public-private partnership set up in the year 2000 with financial backing
from organizations such as,
...and many other
unidentified
philanthropists.
It is important to note that a public-private partnership is a government
and private industry merger or partnership, meaning that these corporate
interests can intertwine with big government.
Now known as the GAVI Alliance, the public-private partnership was
previously known as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation.
Thanks to a $750 million dollar commitment from the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation, GAVI launched its initiative to vaccinate millions of
individuals worldwide. Of course the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also
currently
holds 500,000 shares of
Monsanto, the bloated biotech company
responsible for genetically modifying the food supply and creating mutated
insect populations through the use of heavily altered biopesticides.
It was also the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation that funded the release of
genetically modified mosquitoes, which were actually released into the
environment back in 2010 for testing purposes.
Bill Gates has personally given an
extremely controversial TED talk, in
which he states:
The world today has 6.8 billion people
thats headed up to about 9 billion.
Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive
health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
Skeptics argue that Gates could not have been talking about
vaccine-induced
deaths, though Gates clearly does not stutter or correct himself after
making the statement.
Watch the video of the TED talk below and decide for
yourself:
Governments, World
Bank to help pay for deadly HPV shots
Merck is
offering GAVI a deep discount on Gardasil, down to $5 per vaccine
from $15 per three-dose course.
While this may seem thoughtful, as GAVI
appears to make 0 profit from their generous act of dishing out the deadly
Gardasil vaccine on poor nations, Merck stands to make a substantial profit.
Thanks to a GAVI co-financing policy, recipient countries are required to
contribute toward the cost of the vaccines. This guarantees that not only
Merck, but Gavi as well, will receive considerable amounts of cash from the
9 unknown countries in which the HPV shots are being administered.
Furthermore, the UN World Bank is actually issuing bonds to fund the HPV
shot campaign.
The International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFIm) is an
organization integral in the funding of the campaign.
Created to accelerate
funding for vaccination campaigns, the IFFIm generates funds through the
issuing of bonds in the capital markets, using long-term government pledges
as a guarantee to pay back interest. Since it launched in 2006, the IIFIm
has raised more than $3 billion by tapping into capital markets.
This has
doubled the funds available for GAVIs immunization programs.
Shockingly, GAVIs Tax Form 990 for 2009 shows that
GAVI has net assets of
$2.5 billion - ($2,505,336,042 -page 1).
Not only is the IFFIm generating billions in cash from governments, but
Merck or GlaxoSmithKline may soon be getting a chunk of it for the HPV shot
campaign.
The IFFIm is funded by,
-
France
-
Italy
-
the Netherlands
-
Norway
-
South Africa
-
Spain
-
Sweden
-
the United Kingdom
-
Australia
All of this
information is available through GAVI fact sheets, available on
their
website.
Goldman Sachs,
Deutsche Bank lead-managed bonds
In a
2007 article on the World Banks website, it was revealed that the
International Finance Facility for Immunization hoped to raise $4 billion
over the next 10 years to fund the vaccination of 500 million children.
Among the first buyers were the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and
three other British religious leaders at the IFFIms launch event in London.
Other investors included North American investors (35%), UK investors (12%),
Swiss investors (8%), and investors in the rest of Europe (21%).
The
remainder was placed with investors in the Middle East and Asia, according
to the IFFIm. Interestingly enough, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank
lead-managed the inaugural bond issue.
Notes were also placed with North American investors (35 percent), UK
investors (12 percent), Swiss investors (8 percent) and investors in the
rest of Europe (21 percent).
The remainder was placed with investors in the
Middle East and Asia, according to IFFIm, the World Bank, Goldman Sachs and
Deutsche Bank; the latter two lead-managed the inaugural bond issue.
EU legally bound to
pay over 20 years
The article also mentions that the bonds will be repaid over 20 years by the
UK, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Norway under the terms of legally
binding agreements.
The report
states:
Its a good way to fund immunization programs because the benefits - lives
saved - are realized more quickly as future donor contributions are used to
provide funding now, she says.
Millions spent from
drained governments to push deadly HPV shots
As women take legal action
against Merck for Gardasil-induced abortions and
severe side effects, it seems quite outlandish for GAVI to launch a global
HPV shot initiative.
The HPV shot led to
3,589 harmful reactions and
16 deaths between May 2009 and September 2010 alone.
Of the 3,589 adverse
reactions, many were debilitating. Permanent disability was the result of
213 cases; 25 resulted in the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre Syndrome; there
were 789 other serious reports according to FDA documents.
It was also revealed that the FDA was
hiding 26 additional Gardasil deaths
until Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information act on the information.
Organizations and governments around the globe should be banning Gardasil,
not unleashing it on poor countries.
It seems that GAVI, a multi-billion
dollar merger of government and corporation, is not truly interested in
improving the health of third world inhabitants.
