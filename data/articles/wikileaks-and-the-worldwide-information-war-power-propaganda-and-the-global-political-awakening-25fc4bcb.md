Introduction
The recent release of the 250,000 Wikileaks documents has provoked
unparalleled global interest, both positive, negative, and everywhere in
between.
One thing that can be said with certainty: Wikileaks
is changing
things.
-
There are those who accept what the Wikileaks releases say at face value,
largely due to the misrepresentation of the documents by the
corporate-controlled news.
-
There are those who see the documents as authentic and simply in need of
proper interpretation and analysis.
-
Then there are those, many of whom are in the alternative media, who
approach the leaks with caution and suspicion.
-
There are those who simply cast the leaks aside as a psy-op designed to
target specific nations that fit into U.S. foreign policy objectives.
-
Finally, then, there are those who deplore the leaks as treason or
threatening security.
Of all the claims and notions, the last is, without
a doubt, the most ridiculous. This essay aims to examine the nature of the Wikileaks releases and how they should be approached and understood.
If Wikileaks is changing things, lets hope people will make sure that it
changes things in the right direction.
Media Propaganda Against Iran
- Taking the Cables at Face Value
This perspective is perhaps the most propagated one, as it is largely
influenced and undertaken by the mainstream corporate media, which present
the leaked diplomatic cables as proof of the medias take on major world
issues; most notably among them, Irans nuclear program.
As per usual, the
New York Times steps center stage in its unbridled contempt for truth and
relentless use of propaganda to serve U.S. imperial interests, headlining
articles with titles like,
Around the World, Distress Over Iran, which
explained how Israel and the Arab leaders agree on Iran as a nuclear threat
to the world, with the commentary in the article stating that, running
beneath the cables is a belief among many leaders that unless the current
government in Tehran falls, Iran will have a bomb sooner or later. [1]
Fox
News ran an article proclaiming that,
Leaked Documents Show Middle East
Consensus on Threat Posed by Iran, and commented that, the seismic
document spill by WikiLeaks showed one area of profound agreement - that
Iran is viewed in the Middle East as the region's No. 1 troublemaker. [2]
This, it should be understood, is propaganda.
Yet, we need to properly
refine our understanding of propaganda in order to assess what is
specifically propagandistic about these stories. While one should remain
skeptical of sources and disinformation campaigns (as those who critically
analyze the media have known take place time and time again), one must also
consider the personal perspective of the source and decipher between
authenticity and analysis.
These documents, I truly believe, are authentic.
In this sense, I do not adhere to the notion that these are a part of a
psychological operation (psy-op) or propaganda effort, in terms of the
actual release of the documents. We must keep in mind that the sources for
these cables are U.S. diplomatic channels, and thus the statements within
them reflect the perspectives and beliefs of U.S. diplomatic personnel.
The
documents are an authentic representation of their statements and beliefs,
but that does not imply that they are an accurate representation of reality.
This is where the media comes in to propagandize the information within the
leaks. The two above examples claim that the leaks show that there is a
consensus on Iran, and thus, that the U.S. and indeed Israeli positions on
Iran for the past several years have been vindicated, namely in that they
fear Iran is making nuclear weapons. This is nonsense.
The media has
essentially read and propagated the documents at face value, meaning that
because U.S. diplomats, Middle Eastern and Arab leaders all agree that Iran
is a threat and is trying to make a nuclear weapon, it therefore must be
true. This is a non sequitur.
If a military general tells several soldiers
to commit a raid on a house because there are suspected terrorists inside,
the fact that the soldiers carry out the raid - and that they believe there
are terrorists inside - does not make it so. In contextualizing this example
with the current Wikileaks release, just because Middle Eastern and Arab
leaders see Iran as a threat, does not make it so.
Again, consider the sources. What makes the Arab leaders trustworthy sources
for unbiased information?
For example, one revelation that made its way
around the world was the insistence of Saudi Arabias King Abdullah to
America to,
cut off the head of the snake of Iran, and urging America to
launch military strikes against Iran.[3]
This has largely been interpreted
in the media as proof that there is a consensus on the threat posed by
Iran to the Middle East and the world.
This has been the propaganda line
towed by the New York Times, Fox News and the Israeli government, among many
others. Yet, we need to properly contextualize this information, something
which the New York Times has a long record of failing to properly do
(intentionally, I might add).
I do not doubt the authenticity of these
statements or the beliefs of the Arab leaders that Iran is a threat. Iran,
on the other hand, has claimed that the leaks are mischievous and that
they serve US interests, and claimed that Iran is friends with its
neighbors.[4]
This too, is propaganda. Again, we need to contextualize.
Iran is a Shia nation, while the Arab nations, particularly Saudi Arabia,
are predominantly Sunni. This presents a means of division among these
nations in the region, at least on a superficial basis. The reality,
however, is that Saudi Arabia and Iran are far from friendly, and have not
been on good terms since the Shah was deposed in 1979.
Iran is Saudi
Arabias primary contender and competition for power and influence in the
region, and thus Iran is, inherently, a threat to Saudi Arabia, politically.
Further, the Arab states, whose claims against Iran have been widely
publicized, such as those of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, the UAE and Egypt,
must be understood in their relation to the United States. The Arab states
are American proxies in the region.
Their armies are subsidized by the
American military industrial complex, their political regimes (all of which
are dictatorships and dynasties), are propped up and supported by America.
The same goes for Israel, although it has at least the public outward
appearance of a democracy, much like the United States, itself.
The Arab nations and leaders know that the only reason they have and
maintain their power is because the United States allows them and helps them
to do so.
Thus, they are dependent upon America and its political, financial
and military support. Going against Americas ambitions in the region is a
sure way to end up like Iraq and Saddam Hussein. The history of
the Middle
East in the modern era is replete with examples of how one-time puppets and
personal favorites of the American Empire can so easily turn into new
enemies and threats to peace.
American sponsored regime change takes
place, and a new puppet is installed. If Arab leaders said that Iran was not
a threat to peace, they would soon find themselves targets of Western
imperialism. Further, many, like King Abdullah in Saudi Arabia, are so
virulent in their hatred and distrust of Iran simply because they are
regional competitors for influence.
One thing can be said of all states and
their leaders, they are inherently self-interested and obsessed with
self-preservation and personal power expansion.
Saudi Arabia, in particular, is not a passive actor in the regional battle
of influence with Iran. In Yemen, Saudi Arabia is involved in another
American imperial war of conquest, in suppressing secessionist and
indigenous liberation movements in the North and South of Yemen. Yemen,
ruled by an American supported dictator, Saleh, who has been in power since
1978, is also working with the Americans to suppress its own population in
order to maintain its hold on power.
Much of the presentation of the
conflict, however, is in propagandizing the conflict, portraying it as a
regional battle for influence between Saudi Arabia and Iran. While there is
no doubt, and clear admissions, of Saudi Arabias involvement in the war,
there has been no information that Iran has had any involvement, yet it is
constantly accused by both Saudi Arabia and Yemen of being involved.
This
may be an attempt to draw Iran into a regional proxy war, if not to simply
demonize the nation further. In the midst of this new Yemeni war, America
made an arms deal with Saudi Arabia which broke the record as the largest
U.S. arms deal in history, at $60 billion.
The deal, of which it is no
secret, is aimed at building up Saudi Arabias military capabilities in
order to both engage more effectively in
the Yemen war, but primarily to
challenge and counter increased Iranian influence in the region. In short,
America is arming its proxy nations for a war with Iran.
Israel did not denounce the arms deal as it was taking place, simply because
it ultimately served Israels interest in the region as well, of which its
main target is Iran. Further, Israel is left subdued to American interests,
as an American proxy itself.
If Israels military financing and hardware
comes from America (which it does), thus making it dependent upon America
for its own military power, Israel is in no position to tell America to not
arm its other regional proxies.
If indeed there is a regional
war against
Iran in the making, which it has appeared for some time that there is, it is
certainly in Israels interest to have allies against Iran in the region.
Is Wikileaks a Propaganda Effort?
The leaders of Israel have been very adamant that the Wikileaks documents do
not embarrass Israel to any extent. Prior to the release, the U.S.
government briefed Israeli officials on the type of documents that would be
released by Wikileaks regarding Israel.[5]
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu stated,
there is no disparity between the public discourse
between us and Washington, and the mutual understanding of each others
positions. [6]
The Israeli Defense Minister, Ehud Barak, claimed that the
documents show a more accurate view of reality. [7]
One top Turkish
politician stated that looking at which countries are pleased with the
releases says a lot, and speculated that Israel engineered the release of
documents in an attempt to advance its interests and to pressure
Turkey. [8]
Further, the Internet and various alternative news organizations are abuzz
with speculation that Wikileaks itself may be a propaganda front, perhaps
even a CIA front organization, a method of controlling the opposition
(which, historically we know, is no stranger to CIA activities). Yet, this
speculation is based upon the use of the information that is released in the
cables, and it strikes me as a lack of contextualizing the documents.
So, how should one contextualize this? Lets begin with Israel.
Certainly,
Israel is without a doubt a criminal state (as all states essentially are),
but its criminality is amplified more so than most states on this planet,
possibly outdone only by America, itself. Israels ethnic cleansing of
Palestinians is one of the most horrific and long-lasting crimes against
humanity seen in the past 50 years, and posterity will view Israel as the
vicious, war-mongering, dehumanizing and abhorrent state it is.
Yet, for all
that Israel is, one thing Israel is not, is subtle.
When the Israeli PM
states that the Wikileaks releases are not embarrassing to Israel, he is
mostly correct. This is not because Israel has nothing to hide (remember,
the Wikileaks documents are not top secret documents, but merely
diplomatic cables), but because the diplomatic exchanges Israel makes
largely reflect the reality of the public statements Israel makes.
Israel
and its political elite are no strangers to making absurd public statements,
to constantly threatening war with Iran and other neighbors, or to
propagandizing their beliefs that Iran is making nuclear weapons (something
which has never been proven). Thus, the leaks do not hurt Israels image,
because Israels image, internationally, is already so abysmal and
despicable, and because Israeli diplomats and politicians are generally as
brazen in what they say publicly as they say to each other, that Israels
image has largely remained the same.
Of course, Israeli leaders - political
and military - are using the leaks to suggest that it vindicates their
perspective on Iran as a threat, which of course is an absurd propaganda
ploy, the exact same technique taken on by the corporate media, in taking
the cables at face value.
While Iran has slammed the Wikileaks releases as Western propaganda aimed at
Iran, this statement itself should be taken as a form of propaganda. After
all, Iran claimed that it is friends with all its neighbors, a claim
which is an historical and present falsity. Iran, like all states, uses
propaganda to advance its own interests. Iran is not by any means a
wonderful nation.
However, compared to the American favorites in the region
(such as Saudi Arabia), Iran is a bastion of freedom and democracy, which
isnt saying much.
Those who attempt to battle the spread of misinformation
and propaganda, myself included, must remain highly critical of media
representations and campaigns against Iran, of which there are many. Iran is
firmly in the targets of Americas imperial ambitions, this is no secret.
Yet, there is nothing in the current batch of Wikileaks releases that
strikes me as inauthentic in relation to Iran, especially those documents
pertaining to the perspectives of Western diplomats and Arab leaders in
relation to Iran.
No doubt, they have these perspectives simply because they
reflect the policy priorities of America and the West, itself, not because
they are factual in their substance. In this, we must decipher between
authenticity and accuracy.
Iran stating that the Wikileaks documents are propaganda is a misnomer and
is misleading.
Analysts must not only critically assess the authenticity of
documents (and the sources from which they come), but also, and perhaps even
more importantly, they must critically analyze the interpretation of those
documents. So while I do not doubt the authenticity of documents pertaining
to Western and Middle Eastern perceptions of Iran (as it fits in with the
wider geopolitical realities of the region), it is the interpretation of the
documents that I view as active propaganda efforts on the part of Western
governments and media.
The methods of this propaganda effort, however, are
in depicting the documents as factual assessments of the on-the-ground
reality, which they are not. The documents are factual in how they represent
the views of those who wrote them, which does not mean that they are factual
in their substance.
There is a difference, and acknowledging this difference
is incredibly important in both the exposure of propaganda and assessment of
truth.
The Truth About Diplomacy
Craig Murray is one voice that should be heard on this issue.
Craig Murray
was a former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan who made a name for himself in
exposing intelligence from Uzbekistan related to al-Qaeda as entirely
unreliable, due to the methods of torture used to get the information (such
as boiling people alive). This intelligence was passed to the CIA and MI6,
which Murray said was factually incorrect.
When Murray expressed his
concerns with the higher-ups in the British diplomatic services, he was
reprimanded for talking about human rights. [9]
The British Foreign and
Commonwealth Office (FCO) told Murray that he had one week to resign, and
was threatened with possible prosecution or jail time for revealing state
secrets. [10]
He was subsequently removed from his ambassadorial position,
and has since become something of a political activist.
In short, Murray is
exactly the type of diplomat a person should want: honest. But he was also
exactly the type of diplomat that Western imperial powers dont want:
honest.
In the midst of the latest Wikileaks releases of diplomatic documents, Craig
Murray was asked to write an article for the Guardian regarding his
interpretation of the issue. As Murray later noted, the paper placed his
article, largely reduced, hidden in the middle of a long article which was a
compendium of various commentaries on Wikileaks.
Murray, however, posted
the
full version on his website.
In the article, Murray begins by assessing the
claims of government officials around the world, particularly in the United
States, that Wikileaks,
exposes the United States to harm, that it puts
lives at risk, and that they will encourage Islamic extremism, and most
especially, the notion that government secrecy is essential to keep us all
safe.
Murray explains that having been a diplomat for over 20 years, he is
very familiar with these arguments, particularly that as a result of Wikileaks, diplomats will no longer be candid in giving advice, if that
advice might become public.
Murray elaborates:
Put it another way. The best advice is advice you would not be prepared to
defend in public. Really? Why? In today's globalized world, the Embassy is
not a unique source of expertise. Often expatriate, academic and commercial
organizations are a lot better informed.
The best policy advice is not
advice which is shielded from peer review.
What of course the establishment mean is that Ambassadors should be free to
recommend things which the general public would view with deep opprobrium,
without any danger of being found out. But should they really be allowed to
do that, in a democracy?[11]
Murray pointedly asked why a type of behavior that is considered
reprehensible for most people - such as lying - should be considered
acceptable, or even praiseworthy, in diplomacy.
Murray explained that for
British diplomats,
this belief that their profession exempts them from the
normal constraints of decent behavior amounts to a cult of
Machiavellianism, a pride in their own amorality.
He explained that
diplomats come from a very narrow upper social strata, and view themselves
as ultra-intelligent Nietzschean supermen, above normal morality who are
socially connected to the political elite.
In criticizing the claims made by
many commentators that the release of the leaks endanger lives, Murray
pointedly wrote that this perspective needs to be,
set against any such risk
the hundreds of thousands of actual dead from the foreign policies of the US
and its co-conspirators in the past decade.
Further, for those who posit
that Wikileaks is a psy-op or propaganda operation or that Wikileaks is a
CIA front, Murray had this to say:
Of course the documents reflect the US view - they are official US
government communications. What they show is something I witnessed
personally, that diplomats as a class very seldom tell unpalatable truths to
politicians, but rather report and reinforce what their masters want to
hear, in the hope of receiving preferment.
There is therefore a huge amount about Iran's putative nuclear arsenal and
an exaggeration of Iran's warhead delivery capability.
But there is nothing
about Israel's massive nuclear arsenal. That is not because wikileaks have
censored criticism of Israel. It is because any US diplomat who made an
honest and open assessment of Israeli crimes would very quickly be an
unemployed ex-diplomat.[12]
Murray concluded his article with the statement that all would do well to
keep in mind: Truth helps the people against rapacious elites - everywhere. [13]
World Order and Global Awakening
In attempting to understand Wikileaks and its potential effects (that is, if
the alternative media and citizens activists use this opportunity), we must
place Wikileaks within a wider geopolitical context.
Our human world exists
as a complex system of social interactions.
As powerful and dominating as
elites are and have always been, we must understand that they are not
omnipotent; they are human and flawed, as are their methods and ideas. There
are other forces at work in the human social world, and these various
interactions created and changed the world into what it is, and will
determine where it is going. In effect, nothing is preordained; nothing is
exact.
Plans are made, certainly, by elites, in designing ideas and
reshaping and controlling society. However, society - and in the globalized
world, a global society - react and interact with elite forces and ideas.
Just as the people must react to and experience repercussions from changes
in elite processes, so too must the elite react to and experience
repercussions from changes in social processes.
Today, we can conceptualize
this dichotomy - the geopolitical reality of the world - as The Global
Political Awakening and the New World Order:
There is a new and unique development in human history that is taking place
around the world; it is unprecedented in reach and volume, and it is also
the greatest threat to all global power structures: the global political
awakening.
The term was coined by
Zbigniew Brzezinski, and refers to the
fact that, as Brzezinski wrote:
For the first time in history almost all of humanity is politically
activated,
politically conscious and politically interactive. Global
activism is generating a surge in the quest for cultural respect and
economic opportunity in a world scarred by memories of colonial or imperial
domination.
It is, in essence, this massive global political awakening which presents
the gravest and greatest challenge to the organized powers of globalization
and the global political economy:
The Transnational Capitalist
Class (TCC), or Superclass as David Rothkopf refers to them, are
globalized like never before.
For the first time in history, we have a truly
global and heavily integrated elite. As
elites have globalized their power,
seeking to construct a new world order of global governance and ultimately
global government (decades down the line), they have simultaneously
globalized populations.
The Technological Revolution involves two major geopolitical developments.
The first is that as technology advances, systems of mass communication
rapidly accelerate, and the worlds people are able to engage in instant
communication with one another and gain access to information from around
the world. In it, lies the potential - and ultimately a central source - of
a massive global political awakening.
Simultaneously, the Technological
Revolution has allowed elites to redirect and control society in ways never
before imagined, potentially culminating in a global scientific
dictatorship, as many have warned of since the early decades of the 20th
century.
The potential for controlling the masses has never been so great,
as science unleashes the power of genetics, biometrics, surveillance, and
new forms of modern eugenics; implemented by a scientific elite equipped
with systems of psycho-social control.
Brzezinski has written extensively on the issue of the Global Political
Awakening, and has been giving speeches at various elite think tanks around
the world, informing the elites of this changing global dynamic.
Brzezinski is one of the principle representatives of the global elite and
one of the most influential elite intellectuals in the world.
His analysis
of the 'global political awakening' is useful because of his representation of
it as the primary global threat to elite interests everywhere.
Thus, people
should view the concept of the 'global political awakening' as the greatest
potential hope for humanity and that it should be advanced and aided, as
opposed to Brzezinski`s perspective that it should be controlled and
suppressed.
However, it would be best for Brzezinski to
explain the concept in his own words to allow people to understand how it
constitutes a 'threat' to
elite interests:
For the first time in human history almost all of humanity is politically
activated, politically conscious and politically interactive. There are only
a few pockets of humanity left in the remotest corners of the world that are
not politically alert and engaged with the political turmoil and stirrings
that are so widespread today around the world.
The resulting global
political activism is generating a surge in the quest for personal dignity,
cultural respect and economic opportunity in a world painfully scarred by
memories of centuries-long alien colonial or imperial domination... The
worldwide yearning for human dignity is the central challenge inherent in
the phenomenon of global political awakening.
...America needs to face squarely a centrally important new global reality:
that the world's population is experiencing a political awakening
unprecedented in scope and intensity, with the result that the politics of
populism are transforming the politics of power. The need to respond to that
massive phenomenon poses to the uniquely sovereign America an historic
dilemma: What should be the central definition of America's global role? ...
The central challenge of our time is posed not by global terrorism, but
rather by the intensifying turbulence caused by the phenomenon of global
political awakening.
That awakening is socially massive and politically
radicalizing.
... It is no overstatement to assert that now in the 21st century the
population of much of the developing world is politically stirring and in
many places seething with unrest. It is a population acutely conscious of
social injustice to an unprecedented degree, and often resentful of its
perceived lack of political dignity.
The nearly universal access to radio,
television and increasingly the Internet is creating a community of shared
perceptions and envy that can be galvanized and channeled by demagogic
political or religious passions. These energies transcend sovereign borders
and pose a challenge both to existing states as well as to the existing
global hierarchy, on top of which America still perches.
... The youth of the Third World are particularly restless and resentful.
The demographic revolution they embody is thus a political time-bomb, as
well. With the exception of Europe, Japan and America, the rapidly expanding
demographic bulge in the 25-year-old-and-under age bracket is creating a
huge mass of impatient young people.
Their minds have been stirred by sounds
and images that emanate from afar and which intensify their disaffection
with what is at hand. Their potential revolutionary spearhead is likely to
emerge from among the scores of millions of students concentrated in the
often intellectually dubious "tertiary level" educational institutions of
developing countries.
Depending on the definition of the tertiary
educational level, there are currently worldwide between 80 and 130 million
"college" students.
Typically originating from the socially insecure lower
middle class and inflamed by a sense of social outrage, these millions of
students are revolutionaries-in-waiting, already semi-mobilized in large
congregations, connected by the Internet and pre-positioned for a replay on
a larger scale of what transpired years earlier in Mexico City or in
Tiananmen Square.
Their physical energy and emotional frustration is just
waiting to be triggered by a cause, or a faith, or a hatred.
Brzezinski thus posits that to address this new global challenge to
entrenched powers, particularly nation-states that cannot sufficiently
address the increasingly non-pliant populations and populist demands, what
is required, is,
increasingly supranational cooperation, actively promoted
by the United States.
In other words, Brzezinski favors an increased and
expanded internationalization, not surprising considering he laid the
intellectual foundations of the
Trilateral Commission.
He explains that,
Democracy per se is not an enduring solution, as it could be overtaken by
radically resentful populism.
This is truly a new global reality:
Politically awakened mankind craves political dignity, which democracy can
enhance, but political dignity also encompasses ethnic or national
self-determination, religious self-definition, and human and social rights,
all in a world now acutely aware of economic, racial and ethnic inequities.
The quest for political dignity, especially through national
self-determination and social transformation, is part of the pulse of
self-assertion by the world's underprivileged.
Thus, writes Brzezinski,
an effective response can only come from a
self-confident America genuinely committed to a new vision of global
solidarity.
The idea is that to address the grievances caused by
globalization and global power structures, the world and America must expand
and institutionalize the process of globalization, not simply in the
economic sphere, but in the social and political as well.
It is a flawed
logic, to say the least, that the answer to these systemic problems is to
enhance and strengthen the systemic flaws that created them. One cannot put
out a fire by adding fuel.
Brzezinski even wrote that,
let it be said right away that supranationality
should not be confused with world government. Even if it were desirable,
mankind is not remotely ready for world government, and the American people
certainly do not want it.
Instead, Brzezinski argues, America must be
central in constructing a system of global governance,
in shaping a world
that is defined less by the fiction of state sovereignty and more by the
reality of expanding and politically regulated interdependence.
In other
words, not global government but global governance, which is simply a
rhetorical ploy, as global governance - no matter how overlapping,
sporadic and desultory it presents itself - is in fact a key step and
necessary transition in the moves toward an actual global government
structure.
[The Global Political Awakening and the New
World Order - 24 June 2010]
Conceptualizing Wikileaks
I feel that Wikileaks must be conceptualized within our understanding of
this geopolitical reality we find ourselves in today.
While indeed it is
necessary to be skeptical of such monumental events, we must allow ourselves
to remember that there are always surprises - for everyone - and that the
future is nothing if not unknown. Anything, truly, can happen. There is of
course logic behind the automatic skepticism and suspicion about Wikileaks
from the alternative media; however, they also risk losing an incredible
opportunity presented by Wikileaks, to not only reach more people with
important information, but to better inform that information itself.
For those who view Wikileaks as a conspiracy or plot, as a psy-op of some
kind, while indeed these things have taken place in the past, there is
simply no evidence for it thus far.
Every examination of this concept is
based upon speculation. Many nations around the world, particularly in the
Middle East and South Asia, are pointing to the Western nations as engaging
in a covert propaganda campaign aimed at creating disunity between states
and allies. Iran, Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan have made such claims.
It
is no surprise that most of these are nations, particularly Iran, are
targets of U.S. imperial policy.
Since, however, the Wikileaks releases
speak heavily and negatively about Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia,
China, Venezuela, etc., one must remember that these are diplomatic
cables, and represent the opinions and beliefs of the diplomatic
establishment, a social group which is historically and presently deeply
enmeshed and submissive to elite ideology and methodology. In short, these
are the foreign imperial envoys, and as such, they are ideological
imperialists and represent imperial interests.
As has been the case both historically and presently, imperial objectives
are hidden with political rhetoric. Since, politically, these are target
nations of the American imperial elite, Americas diplomatic representatives
will focus on these nations, and adopt the same ideas and beliefs.
How many
people have ever been given a raise by questioning and then disregarding
their superiors management technique?
Thus, in their respective nations and
operations, the diplomats will seek information that targets these nations
or serve specific American imperial objectives. If all the information they
come up with are rumors and conjectures and repeated talking points, that
is what will be seen in the diplomatic cables. Indeed, that was exactly the
case.
The cables are full of rumors and unsupported allegations. So
naturally, they would target these specific nations - deemed geopolitically
significant by American imperial interests - and why there would be far less
information on Israel and other allied nations. This is why it seems to me
that these cables are authentic. They seem to represent the reality of the
diplomatic social group, and thus they are a vivid exploration in the
study of imperialism. We have been given the opportunity to see the
communications of imperial diplomacy.
It is in this, that we are presented
with an incredible opportunity.
Further, in regards to many Middle Eastern and Asian nations framing
Wikileaks as a Western plot, as critical thinkers we must take note of the
geopolitical reality of the global political awakening.
All states are
self-interested, that is the nature of a state. Elites all over the world
are aware of the reality and potential political power of the global
political awakening and thus, seek to suppress or co-opt its potential.
States which are often viewed by the critical press as targets by Western
imperial powers (such as Iran), may seek to use this power to its own
advantage. They may attempt to steer the global awakening and the
alternative media to their favor, which gives them political power. But
the alternative media must not pick sides in terms of global elites and
power structures, we must remain critical of all sides and all actors.
Wikileaks is receiving an incredible readership and is reaching out to new
audiences, globally, in the American homeland itself, and to the youth of
the world. Peoples perceptions are beginning to change on a variety of
issues.
The question is:
will the alternative media ignore Wikileaks and
isolate itself, or will they engage with Wikileaks, and prevent the
mainstream corporate media from having a monopoly of interpretation, which
becomes inherently propagandistic.
Wikileaks is having global repercussions,
and has been very good for the newspaper and mainstream news industries,
which have been on a steady decline.
This too, can be an issue to reach out
to this new and growing audience, and to bring them to a new perspective. If
we do not reach out, we are left talking to each other, further isolating
ourselves, and ultimately becoming subverted and ineffective for change. We
need to reach out to new audiences, and this is an incredible opportunity to
do so.
People are interested, people are curious, people are hungry for
more.
Wikileaks and the Media
Instead of deriding Wikileaks as not telling us anything we didnt know
before, perhaps the alternative media should use the popularity and momentum
of Wikileaks to take from it the documentation and analysis that further
strengthens our arguments and beliefs.
This will allow for others,
especially new audiences of interested people worldwide, to place the Wikileaks releases within a wider context and understanding. The reports
from Wikileaks are revelations only to those who largely adhere to the
illusions of the world: that we live in democracies promoting freedom
around the world and at home, etc.
The revelations however, are not simply
challenging American perceptions of America, but of all nations and their
populations. The fact that these people are reading and discovering new
things for which they are developing an interest is an incredible change.
This is likely why the corporate media is so heavily involved in the
dissemination of this information (which itself is a major source of
suspicion for the alternative media):
to control the interpretation of the
message.
It is the job of the alternative media and intellectuals and other
thinking individuals to challenge that interpretation with factual analysis.
The Wikileaks releases, in fact, give us more facts to place within and
support our interpretations than they do for the corporate media.
We must ask why the Wikileaks releases were revelations for most people?
Well, it was surprising simply for the fact that the media itself has such a
strong hold on the access, dissemination and interpretation of information.
They are revelations because people are indoctrinated with myths. They are
not revelations to the alternative media because we have been talking
about these things for years. However, while they may not necessarily be
revelations, they are in fact, confirmations and vindications and
bring more information to the analysis. It is in this, that a great
opportunity lies.
For since the leaks support and better inform our
perspectives, we can build on this concept and examine how Wikileaks adds to
and supports critical analysis.
For those who are newly interested and
looking for information, or for those who are having their previous
perceptions challenged, it is the alternative media and critical voices
alone who can place that information in a wider context for everyone else.
In this, more people will see how it is the alternative media and critical
perspectives which were more reflective of reality than say, the mainstream
media (for which Wikileaks is a revelation).
Thus, more people may soon
start turning to alternative media and ideas; after all, our perspectives
were vindicated, not those of the mainstream media (though they attempt to
spin it as such).
We are under a heavy propaganda offensive on the part of the global
corporate and mainstream media to spin and manipulate these leaks to their
own interests. We, as alternative media and voices, must use Wikileaks to
our advantage. Ignoring it will only damage our cause and undermine our
strength. The mainstream media understood that; so too, must we.
Wikileaks
presents in itself a further opportunity for the larger exposure of
mainstream media as organized propaganda.
By surprising so many people
with the revelations, the media has in effect exposed itself as deeply
inadequate in their analysis of the world and the major issues within it.
While currently it is giving the mainstream media a great boost, we are
still immersed in the era of the Technological Revolution and there is
still (for now, anyway) Internet freedom, and thus, the tide can quickly
turn.
Like the saying goes,
the rich man will sell you the rope to hang him with
if he thinks he can make a buck on it.
Perhaps the mainstream media has
done the same.
No other organized apparatus was as capable of disseminating
as much material as quickly and with such global reach as the mainstream
media. If the leaks initially only made it into alternative media, then the
information would only reach those whom are already reading the alternative
press.
In that, they would not be such grand revelations and would have
had a muted effect. In the mainstream medias global exposure of Wikileaks
material (never mind their slanted and propagandistic interpretations), they
have changed the dynamic and significance of the information.
By reaching
wider and new audiences, the alternative and critical voices can co-opt
these new audiences; lead them away from the realm of information control
into the realm of information access.
This is potentially one of the
greatest opportunities presented for the alternative and critical voices of
the world.
Wikileaks is a globally transformative event. Not simply in terms of
awakening new people to new information, but also in terms of the effect
it is having upon global power structures, itself. With ambassadors
resigning, diplomats being exposed as liars and tools, political rifts
developing between Western imperial allies, and many careers and reputations
of elites around the world at great risk, Wikileaks is creating the
potential for an enormous deterioration in the effectiveness of imperialism
and domination.
That, in itself, is an admirable and worthy goal. That this
is already a reality is representative of how truly transformative Wikileaks
is and could be.
People, globally, are starting to see their leaders through
a lens not filtered by public relations. Through mainstream media, it gets
filtered through propaganda, which is why it is an essential duty of the
alternative media and critical thinkers to place this information in a
wider, comprehensive context. This would further erode the effectiveness of
empire.
With the reaction of several states and policing organizations to issue
arrest warrants for Julian Assange, or in calling for his assassination (as
one Canadian adviser to the Prime Minister
suggested on television), these
organizations and individuals are exposing their own hatred of democracy,
transparency and freedom of information.
Their reactions can be used to
discredit their legitimacy to rule. If policing agencies are supposed to
protect and serve, why are they seeking instead to punish and subvert
those who expose the truth? Again, this comes as no surprise to those who
closely study the nature of the state, and especially the modern phenomenon
of the militarization of domestic society and the dismantling of rights and
freedoms.
However, it is happening before the eyes of the whole world, and
people are paying attention.
This is new.
This is an incredible opportunity to criticize foreign policy (read:
imperial strategy), and to disembowel many global power structures. More
people, now, than ever before, will be willing to listen, learn and
investigate for themselves.
Wikileaks should be regarded as a gift, not a
distraction.
Instead of focusing on the parts of the Wikileaks cables
which do not reflect the perspectives of the alternative media (such as on
Iran), we must use Wikileaks to better inform our own understanding not
simply of the policy itself, but of the complex social interactions and
ideas that create the basis for the policy to be carried out.
In regards
to the diplomatic cables themselves, we are better able to understand the
nature of diplomats as agents of empire, and so instead of discounting the
cables as propaganda we must use them against the apparatus of empire
itself: to expose the empire for what it is. Wikileaks helps to unsheathe
and strip away the rhetoric behind imperial policy, and expose diplomats not
as informed observers, but as agents of power.
The reaction by nations,
organizations and institutions around the world adds further fuel to this
approach, as we are seeing the utter distaste political leaders have for
democracy and freedom of information, despite their rhetoric. Several
institutions of power can be more widely exposed in this manner.
A recent addition to this analysis can be in the role played by universities
not in education but in indoctrination and the production of new agents
of power.
For example, Columbia University is one of the most respected
and revered universities in the world, which has produced several
individuals and significant sectors of the political elite (including
diplomats).
In reaction to the Wikileaks releases, Columbia University has
warned,
students they risk future job prospects if they download any of the
material, which followed a government ban on employees, estimated at more
than two-and-a-half million people, using work computers and other
communication devices to look at diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks.
The University,
emailed students at the university's school of international
and public affairs, a recruiting ground for the state department. [14]
Good
for Columbia!
What do they think university is for, education or
something? How dare students take education into their own hands, especially
students who will likely be future diplomats.
This university reaction to Wikileaks helps call into attention the role of universities in our society,
and specifically the role of universities in shaping the future managers
of the imperial apparatus.
Wikileaks as an Opportunity
If Wikileaks is a psy-op, it is either the stupidest or most intelligent
psychological operation ever undertaken.
But one thing is for sure: systems
and structures of power are in the process of being exposed to a much wider
audience than ever before. The question for the alternative media and
critical researchers, alike, is what will they do with this information and
this opportunity?
Julian Assange was recently
interviewed by Time Magazine about Wikileaks, in
which he explained to the inadequately informed editor of Time Magazine that
organizations which are secretive need to be exposed:
If their behavior is revealed to the public, they have one of two choices:
one is to reform in such a way that they can be proud of their endeavors,
and proud to display them to the public.
Or the other is to lock down
internally and to balkanize, and as a result, of course, cease to be as
efficient as they were. To me, that is a very good outcome, because
organizations can either be efficient, open and honest, or they can be
closed, conspiratorial and inefficient.[15]
Assange further explained some of his perspectives regarding the influence
of and reactions to Wikileaks, stating that the Chinese:
appear to be terrified of free speech, and while one might say that means
something awful is happening in the country, I actually think that is a very
optimistic sign, because it means that speech can still cause reform and
that the power structure is still inherently political, as opposed to
fiscal.
So journalism and writing are capable of achieving change, and that
is why Chinese authorities are so scared of it.
Whereas in the United States
to a large degree, and in other Western countries, the basic elements of
society have been so heavily fiscalized through contractual obligations that
political change doesn't seem to result in economic change, which in other
words means that political change doesn't result in change.[16]
In
the interview, Assange turned to the issue of the Internet and community
media:
For the rise of social media, it's quite interesting. When we first started
[in 2006], we thought we would have the analytical work done by bloggers and
people who wrote Wikipedia articles and so on. And we thought that was a
natural, given that we had lots of quality, important content...
The bulk of
the heavy lifting - heavy analytical lifting - that is done with our
materials is done by us, and is done by professional journalists we work
with and by professional human-rights activists. It is not done by the
broader community.
However, once the initial lifting is done, once a story
becomes a story, becomes a news article, then we start to see community
involvement, which digs deeper and provides more perspective.
So the social
networks tend to be, for us, an amplifier of what we are doing. And also a
supply of sources for us.[17]
As researchers, media, and critics, we must realize that our perspectives
and beliefs must be open to change and evolution.
Simply because something
like this has never happened before does not mean that it isnt happening
now. We live in the era of the Technological Revolution, and the Internet
has changed economics, politics and society itself, on a global scale. This
is where the true hope in furthering and better informing the global
political awakening will need to take speed and establish itself.
True
change in our world is not going to come from already-established or
newly-created institutions of power, which is where all issues are currently
being addressed, especially those of global significance. True change,
instead, can only come not from global power structures, but from the global
community of people, interacting with one another via the power unleashed
by the Technological Revolution.
Change must be globally understood and
community organized.
We are on the verge of a period of global social transformation, the
question is:
-
Will we do anything about it?
-
Will we seek to inform and
partake in this transition, or will we sit and watch it be misled,
criticizing it as it falters and falls?
Just as Martin Luther King commented
in his 1967 speech, Beyond Vietnam, that it seemed as if America was on the
wrong side of a world revolution, now there is an opportunity to remedy
that sad reality, and not simply on a national scale, but global.
Despite all the means and methods of power and domination in this world, for
every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
As things
progressively get worse and worse, as any independent observer of the world
has noticed, life has a way of creating means and methods to counter these
regressions. As globalization has facilitated the emergence of a global
elite, and several global institutions and ideologies of global power, so
too has this process facilitated the globalization of opposition.
So while
elites, globally, actively work to integrate and expand global power
structures, they are inadvertently integrating and expanding global
opposition to those very same power structures. This is the great paradox of
our time, and one which we must recognize, for it is not simply a factual
observation, but it is a hopeful situation.
Hope should not be underestimated, and it is something that I have
personally struggled with in my views of the world.
It is hard to see hope
when you study so much horror in the world, and see how little is being
done about it. But activism and change need hope. This is very evident from
the Obama campaign, which was splashed with rhetoric of hope and change,
something that all people rightfully want and need. However, Obamas hope
and change were Wall Street brands and patents, it was a glorious practice
in the art of propaganda, and a horrific blow to true notions of hope and
change.
There is a reason why the Obama campaign took the top prizes in
public relations industry awards.[18]
Hope is needed, but it cannot be misplaced hope, as it was with Obama. It
must be a hope grounded not in blind faith but in honest analysis. While
indeed on most fronts in the world, things are getting progressively worse,
the alternative media has focused almost exclusively on these issues that
they have blinded themselves to the positive geopolitical developments in
the world, namely the global political awakening and the role of the
Internet in reshaping global society.
While these issues are acknowledged,
they are not fully understood or explained within the wider context: that
these are in fact, hopeful developments; that there is hope.
Wikileaks strengthens this notion, if it is to be taken as an
opportunity.
A critique
without hope falls on deaf ears. No one wants to hear that things are
hopeless, so while an examination of what is wrong in the world is
integral to moving forward, so too is an examination of what is hopeful and
positive. This spreads the message and builds its supporters.
The Internet
as a medium facilitates the spread of this message, and after all, as one of
the foremost media theorists, Marshall McLuhan, noted,
The medium is the
message.
Appendix of Revelations and Vindications
- A Call to Action for
Alternative Media
So what are some of the supposed revelations which can be used as
vindications by the alternative media?
Well, for one, the role of royalty
as a relevant and powerful economic and political actor in the world today.
And by this I do not simply refer to states where monarchs remain as
official rulers, such as in Saudi Arabia, but more specifically to West
European and notably the
British monarchs.
For those who have studied
institutions like the
Bilderberg Group and the
Trilateral Commission, the
relevance of European royalty in international affairs is not a new concept.
For the majority of people (who havent even heard of the Bilderberg Group
or Trilateral Commission), these monarchs are largely viewed as symbolic
figures as opposed to political actors.
This is, of course, naïve, as all
monarchs have always been political actors, however, it is a naivety that
has now been challenged on a much wider scale and to a much wider audience.
There was a time when I would discuss the relevance of monarchs in the
modern world, and it would be a subject that would be treated by many others
as an absurd notion:
but the Queen has no real power, shes a figurehead,
etc.
Wikileaks has exposed that notion as a falsity, and it should be an
issue that is expanded upon.
For example, within the Wikileaks cables, take the British Prince Andrew,
Queen Elizabeths second son, who has been subject to many cable
revelations.
The
U.S. Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan wrote a cable regarding a
meeting she attended with several British and Canadian businessmen and
Prince Andrew, who is a special U.K. trade representative to the Middle East
and Central Asia.
At the meeting, Prince Andrew ranted against,
those
[expletive] journalists... who poke their noses everywhere, and he railed
at British anticorruption investigators, who had had the 'idiocy' of almost
scuttling the al-Yamama deal with Saudi Arabia, particularly referencing
an investigation, subsequently closed, into alleged kickbacks a senior Saudi
royal had received in exchange for the multi-year, lucrative BAE Systems
contract to provide equipment and training to Saudi security forces.
When
he ranted against the media - specifically the Guardian paper - for making
it harder to do business abroad, the U.S. Ambassador noted that the
businessmen in attendance roared their approval and practically
clapped. [19]
Again, evidence for how elites despise true representations of
democracy and freedom.
At that same meeting, Prince Andrew made another startling claim, and one
which had not been as widely publicized in the media to date.
He stated that
to the U.S. Ambassador that:
the United Kingdom, Western Europe (and by
extension you Americans too) were now back in the thick of playing the Great
Game, and, this time we aim to win!
Further, Prince Andrew, the Duke of
York,
then stated that he was very worried about Russia's resurgence in
the region, and referred to Chinese economic and political expansion in the
region as probably inevitable, but a menace.
On the way out of the
meeting, one British businessman said to the U.S. Ambassador,
What a
wonderful representative for the British people! We could not be prouder of
our royal family! [20]
Well, there you have it, a rich prince running around
the world with rich businessmen promoting their economic interests in
foreign countries and referring to it as the age-old imperial competition
between Britain and Russia in the Great Game for dominance over Central
Asia.
And we call our countries democracies and exporters of freedom?
This is quite typical behavior of the royal family, however, as a former
South African MP and anti-corruption campaigner, Andrew Feinstein,
explained,
the royal family has actively supported Britain's arms sales,
even when corruption and malfeasance has been suspected, and that, the
royal family was involved in trying to persuade South Africa to buy BAE's
Hawk jets, despite the air force not wanting the planes that cost two and a
half times the price of their preferred aircraft.
As an ANC MP at the time,
I was told that £116m in bribes had been paid to key decision-makers and the
ANC itself. The royal family's attitude is part of the reason that BAE will
never face justice in the UK for its corrupt practices. [21]
The British royals are also very close with Arab monarchs, which makes
sense, considering it was the British Empire (and the Crown behind it)
that created the Arab monarchs and gave them power in the first place.
Prince Andrew went on hunting trips with the King of Jordan and the Chief of
Staff of the Armed Forces of the UAE.[22]
Further, Prince Charles is
considered a strategic diplomatic figure in regards to Saudi Arabia, as the
cables reveal.
The British media headlined with the revelation that Prince
Charles is not as respected as Queen Elizabeth, but the real story was
buried in the same article beneath the royal gossip, as cables revealed that
Prince Charles and his wife,
have helped to overcome severe strains
following Saudi Arabia's imprisonment and torture of five Britons from
December 2001 to August 2003 and the UK's official fraud investigations of
British Aerospace operations in Saudi Arabia in 2004.
As one U.S.
diplomatic cable explained, the British royals,
helped re-build UK-Saudi
ties as the House of Saud and the House of Windsor build upon their royal
commonality.
In other words, they both represent unelected and
unaccountable elite dynastic power, and so they should naturally work
together in their own interests. How democratic of them.
Further, a
Saudi royal threw a lavish party for Prince Charles in Saudi Arabia with the
help of an unnamed British businessman.[23]
It looks, however, like the British royals will have to again move in to
smooth out ties with Saudi Arabia, as revelations about the country and
its monarch paint a picture of a not-so-helpful Western ally. In short,
Saudi Arabia and its monarch have received one of the largest public
relations disasters in recent history.
The British monarch may be too busy
cleaning up their own mess, or have too much light on them at the moment, to
be able to gracefully maneuver through yet another imperious royal
visit. What am I referring to here in terms of bad PR for the Saudis? Its
quite simple, the Saudi royals, good friends of the British monarch, are
incidentally the principle financiers of Sunni terrorists (which includes
what we commonly refer to as al-Qaeda) worldwide.
While this comes as no surprise to those who have critically analyzed
al-Qaeda or the war on terror, it is indeed a revelation to the majority
of people.
While Western governments and media propaganda machines have for
years blamed terrorist financing and support on target nations like
Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and more recently, Pakistan and Yemen, the Wikileaks
cables vindicated the historical and present reality that it is in fact
the main Western allies in the region, especially Saudi Arabia, but also the
other major Gulf Arab states (and their monarchs), who are the main
financiers and supporters of terrorism, and most notably, al-Qaeda.
A memo
signed by
Hillary Clinton confirmed that Saudi Arabia is understood to be,
the world's largest source of funds for Islamist militant groups such as
the Afghan Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba, as well as al-Qaeda itself.
Further, three other Arab states,
...are listed as other chief terrorist financiers.
As the Guardian put
it,
the cables highlight an often ignored factor in the Pakistani and
Afghan conflicts: that the violence is partly bankrolled by rich,
conservative donors across the Arabian Sea.
While Pakistan is largely
blamed for aiding the Taliban in Afghanistan, it is in fact Saudi Arabia as
well as UAE-based businesses which are its chief financiers. Kuwait, another
staunch U.S. ally, is a source of funds and a key transit point for
al-Qaeda.[24]
While the New York Times was busy declaring Wikileaks as providing a,
new
consensus on Iran, with the Saudi King urging America to attack and cut
the head off the snake, they mentioned only in passing, how Saudi donors
remain the chief financiers of Sunni militant groups like Al Qaeda. [25]
Now, while these are indeed revelations to many, we must place these facts
in their proper context.
This is not simply to be taken as Saudi Arabia and
Arab states being responsible, alone, for support of terrorism and al-Qaeda,
but that they are simply playing the role they have always played, and that
diplomacy is sidelined and kept in the dark on this issue as it always has
been.
What I mean by this is that the contextualization of these facts must be
placed in a comprehensive historical analysis.
Looking at the history of
al-Qaeda, arising out of the Soviet-Afghan War, with major covert support
from America and other Western allies, the center of this operation was in
the Safari Club, which constituted a secret network of Western
intelligence agencies (such as those of France, Britain and America) and
regional intelligence agencies (such as those of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan),
in carrying out the financing, training, arming and operational support of
the Mujahideen, and subsequently the Taliban and al-Qaeda.
The Safari Club
was established in 1976 (with the help of CIA director at the time, George H.W. Bush, another close friend of the Saudi royals), and was designed to
respond to increasing political oversight of intelligence operations in
America (as a result of the Church Committee investigations on CIA
operations), and so the Safari Club was created to allow for a more covert
and discreet network of intelligence operations, with no oversight.
Diplomats were kept in the dark about its operations and indeed its
existence, while the quiet covert relationships continued behind the scenes.
This network, in some form or another, exists up to the present day, as I
recently documented in my three-part series on The Imperial Anatomy of
al-Qaeda.
In short, there is a reason that while diplomats complain quietly about
Saudi and Arab financing and support for al-Qaeda, nothing is actually done:
because through other avenues, the American imperial structure and apparatus
supports and facilitates this process.
Diplomacy is more overt in its
imperial ambitions, thus the reality of the cables reflecting a focus on
Iran and Pakistan, yet intelligence operations are a much more covert means
of establishing and maintaining particular imperial relationships. This
information again should not be taken at face value, but rather placed
within its broader geopolitical context.
In this sense, the information is
not disinformation or propaganda, but rather additional factual
vindication and information.
While Western governments and media publicly scorn Iran and accuse it of
meddling in the affairs of Iraq, and of supporting terrorism and
destabilization of the country, the reality is that while Iran certainly
exerts influence in Iraq, (after all, they are neighbors), Saudi Arabia is
a far greater source of destabilization than Iran is accused of being, and
this is from the mouths of Iraqi leaders themselves.
Iraqi government
officials, reported the Guardian,
see Saudi Arabia, not Iran, as the
biggest threat to the integrity and cohesion of their fledgling democratic
state.
In a cable written by the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, it was explained
that,
Iraq views relations with Saudi Arabia as among its most challenging
given Riyadh's money, deeply ingrained anti-Shia attitudes and [Saudi]
suspicions that a Shia-led Iraq will inevitably further Iranian regional
influence.
Further,
Iraqi contacts assess that the Saudi goal (and that of
most other Sunni Arab states, to varying degrees) is to enhance Sunni
influence, dilute Shia dominance and promote the formation of a weak and
fractured Iraqi government.
In short, that would mean that Saudi Arabia is
actually doing what the West accuses Iran of doing in Iraq.
So while Iran
certainly has been promoting its own interests in Iraq, it is more
interested in a stable Shia government, while Saudi Arabia is more
interested in a weak and fractured government, and thus promotes sectarian
conflict.
One interesting fact to note that came out of the cables, is the
increasing perspective among Iraqi youth rejecting foreign interference from
any government, with diplomatic cables articulating that,
a 'mental
revolution' was under way among Iraqi youth against foreign agendas seeking
to undermine the country's stability. [26]
It should come as no surprise, then, that one top Saudi royal (in fact the
former head of Saudi Arabias intelligence agency and thus the man
responsible for handling Saudi Arabias relationship with terrorists),
Prince Turki al-Faisal, said that the source of the diplomatic leaks should
be vigorously punished.
Turki, who has also been the Saudi Ambassador to
the U.K. and America, said,
the WikiLeaks furor underscored that cyber
security was an increasing international concern. [27]
What other areas can Wikileaks be used to further inform and vindicate the
critical media? Well, start with Saudi Arabias neighbour to the south,
Yemen.
Whether or not most Americans (or for that matter, most people in
general) are aware that America is waging a war in Yemen, just across the
water from where America is waging another war against Somalia (since
2006/07).
This past October, I wrote an article about the imperial war in
Yemen as a war being fought under the auspices of the War on Terror and
fighting al-Qaeda (financed by the Saudi elite); but which in reality is
about America and other Western imperial powers (such as the U.K.) propping
up a despotic leaders who has been in power since 1978, by supporting him in
his campaign to eliminate a rebel movement in the North and a massive
secessionist movement in the South.
Saudi Arabia entered the conflict in
August of 2009 by bombing rebel holdouts in the North along the Saudi
border, as the Saudi elite are afraid of the movement spreading to
disaffected groups within Saudi Arabia itself.
America inserted itself into the war by increasing the amount of money and
military aid given to Yemen (in effect, subsidizing their military, as they
do heavily with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, all the Arab states,
and dozens of other states around the world), as well as providing direct
special forces training and assistance, not to mention carrying out missile
strikes within Yemen against al-Qaeda training camps which American
intelligence officials claimed killed 60 militants.
In reality, 52
innocent people died, with over half of them being women and children. At
the time, both Yemen and America claimed it was an al-Qaeda training camp
and that the cruise missile was fired by the Yemeni government, despite the
fact that it had no such weapons in its arsenal, unlike the U.S. Navy
patrolling the coastline.
The missile strike was carried out by America on
direct presidential orders.
Several days later, there was the bizarre attempted terrorist attack in
which a young Nigerian man was arrested attempting to blow up his underwear
(who was helped onto the plane by a mysterious Indian man in a suit who
claimed he was a diplomat, according to witnesses), and who was subsequently
linked to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (an organization which started
up not much earlier when a Guantanamo inmate returned to Saudi Arabia only
to escape Saudi custody, and flee to Yemen to start a new al-Qaeda
branch).
This provided the justification for America to dramatically
increase its military aid to Yemen, which more than doubled from $67 million
to $150 million, and came with increased special forces training and
assistance, as well as increased CIA activity, discussing using drone
attacks to kill innocent people (as they do in Pakistan), and more missile
strikes.
This previous September, the Yemen government laid siege to a town in the
South while the Obama administrations top counter-terrorism official, John
Brennan, was in Yemen for talks with President Saleh. The town was claimed
to be a sanctuary for al-Qaeda, but it has key strategic significance as
well.
It is just south of a major new liquid natural gas pipeline, and the
town happened to be home to many people involved in the Southern
secessionist movement.
The Yemeni government barred any outside or
independent observers from witnessing the siege, which lasted days.
However,
for the many who fled the conflict and siege, they were claiming that the
Islamic militants were working with the government against the rebel
movement in the North and secessionist movement in the South, and according
to one NPR reporter,
this is more about fighting or subduing the
secessionist movement than it is about al-Qaida.
[See: Andrew Gavin Marshall, Yemen: The Covert Apparatus of the American
Empire, Global Research, 5 October 2010]
The Wikileaks revelations further inform and confirm much of this
analysis.
In regards to the missile strike that killed innocent women and
children on Obamas orders, Wikileaks cables revealed that Yemeni President
Saleh,
secretly offered US forces unrestricted access to his territory to
conduct unilateral strikes against al-Qaida terrorist targets.
As Saleh
told John Breannan in September of 2009,
I have given you an open door on
terrorism. So I am not responsible.
Regarding the December 21 strike that
killed the innocent civilians, a cable explained,
Yemen insisted it must
'maintain the status quo' regarding the official denial of US involvement. Saleh wanted operations to continue 'non-stop until we eradicate this
disease, and days later in a meeting with U.S. Central Command head,
General David Patraeus, Saleh admitted lying to his population about the
strikes.
He told the General, We'll continue saying the bombs are ours,
not yours. [28]
In regards to Pakistan, while it is important to be highly critical of the
validity of the perspectives within the cables in regards to Pakistan and
the Taliban, since Pakistan is a current and escalating target in the War
[OF] Terror, there are things to keep in mind: historically, the Pakistani
ISI has funded, armed and trained the Taliban, but always with U.S.
assistance and support.
Thus, we must examine the situation presently and so
historically.
Wikileaks revealed (as I mentioned previously), that Arab Gulf
states help fund the Taliban in Afghanistan, so the common claim that it is
Pakistan alone is immediately made to be erroneous. Is it possible that
Pakistan is still working with the Taliban? Of course. They have
historically through their intelligence services,
the ISI, and while they
have never done it without U.S. support (mostly through the CIA), the ISI
still receives most of its outside funding from
the CIA.[29]
The CIA funding
of the ISI, a reality since the late 70s, picked up dramatically following
9/11, the operations of which the ISI has been itself complicit in
financing.[30] Thus, the CIA rewarded the financiers of 9/11 by increasing
their funds.
The trouble with discounting information that does not fit in with your
previously conceived ideas is that it does not allow for evolution or
progress in thinking. This should never be done in regards to any subject,
yet it is commonly done for all subjects, by official and critical voices
alike. With Pakistan, we must understand that while historically it has been
a staunch U.S. ally in the region, propping up every government, supporting
every coup, American geopolitical ambitions have changed as a result of the
changing geopolitical reality of the world.
Pakistan has drawn increasingly
close to China, which built a major seaport on Pakistans coast, giving
China access to the Indian Ocean.
This is a strategic threat to India and
the United States more broadly, which seeks to subdue and control Chinas
growing influence (while simultaneously attempting to engage in efforts of
international integration with China, specifically economically). India and
Pakistan are historical enemies, and wars have been fought between them
before. India and America are in a strategic alliance, and America helped
India with its nuclear program, much to the distaste of the Pakistanis, who
drew closer to China.
Pakistan occupies an area of the utmost strategic
importance: with its neighbors being Afghanistan, China, India and Iran.
American policy has changed to support a civilian government, kept weak and
subservient to U.S. interests, while America covertly expands its wars
inside Pakistan. This is creating an incredible potential for absolute
destabilization and fragmentation, potentially resulting in total civil war.
America appears to be undertaking a similar policy in Pakistan that it
undertook in fracturing Yugoslavia throughout the 1990s.
Only that Pakistan
has a population of 170 million people and nuclear weapons. As America
expands its destabilization of Pakistan, the risk of a nuclear war between
Pakistan and India dramatically increases, as does the risk of
destabilization spreading regionally to its neighbors of India, China,
Afghanistan and Iran.
The American-urged separation of the Pakistani
military from official power in Pakistan (as in, its not a military
dictatorships), was designed to impose a completely U.S. dependent civilian
government and isolate an increasingly frustrated and antagonized Pakistani
military.
As the Wikileaks cables revealed, General Kayani, head of the Pakistani
military, threatened to depose the Pakistani government in a coup in March
of 2009, and he discussed this in meetings with the U.S. Ambassador to
Pakistan, Anne Patterson. The cables revealed that the Pakistani Army Chief
disliked the civilian government, but that they disliked the opposition even
more, which was rallying people in the streets.[31]
This reveals the
intimate nature the U.S. has with the Pakistani military, as it always has.
The U.S. did not support this proposal, as it currently favors a weak
civilian government, and therefore a strong military dictatorship is not in
Americas (or Indias) interest. Thus, there was no coup. Hence, Wikileaks
can be used to further inform and vindicate analysis of Pakistan.
For those
who have been speaking about the destabilization of Pakistan for years, and
there have been many, Wikileaks provides more resources to a critical
analysis, and suddenly more people around the world might be interested in
new ideas and perspectives, as Wikileaks has challenged so many of their
previously held beliefs.
The list of examples surfacing from the Wikileaks cables is endless in the
amount of additional information it can add in the alternative medias
dissemination of information and analysis. These were but a few examples
among many.
Make no mistake, this is an opportunity for the spread of truth,
not a distraction from it.
Treat it accordingly.
