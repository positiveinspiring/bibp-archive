The Crisis of Civilization is a documentary feature film investigating how
global crises like,
-
ecological disaster
-
financial meltdown
-
dwindling oil
reserves
-
terrorism
-
food shortages,
...are converging symptoms of a single,
failed global system.
Weaving together archival film footage and animations, film-maker Dean
Puckett, animator Lucca Benney and international security analyst Dr. Nafeez
Mosaddeq Ahmed, offer a stunning wake-up call proving that another world
is not merely possible, but on its way.
The film reveals how a failure to understand the systemic context of these
crises, linked to neoliberal ideology, has generated a tendency to deal not
with their root structural causes, but only with their symptoms.
This has led to the
proliferation of war,
terror, and
state-terror,
including encroachment on civil liberties, while accelerating global crises
rather than solving them.
