The war between the United States and Iran is
on.
American taxpayer dollars are being used, with
the permission of Congress, to fund activities that result in Iranians being
killed and wounded, and Iranian property destroyed. This wanton violation of
a nations sovereignty would not be tolerated if the tables were turned and
Americans were being subjected to Iranian-funded covert actions that took
the lives of Americans, on American soil, and destroyed American property
and livelihood.
Many Americans remain unaware of what is
transpiring abroad in their name.

Members of the Iranian resistance group Mujahadeen-e Khalk, or MEK,
guard a road leading to the
groups main training camp,
watched over by a U.S. Army
Abrams tank in background, near Baqubah in north-central Iraq.
Many of those who are cognizant of these
activities are supportive of them, an outgrowth of misguided sentiment which
holds Iran accountable for a list of grievances used by the U.S. government
to justify the ongoing global war on terror. Iran, we are told, is not just
a nation pursuing nuclear weapons, but is the largest state sponsor of
terror in the world today.
Much of the information behind this is being promulgated by Israel, which
has a vested interest in seeing Iran neutralized as a potential threat. But
Israel is joined by another source, even more puzzling in terms of its
broad-based acceptance in the world of American journalism: the
Mujahadeen-e Khalk, or MEK, an Iranian opposition group
sworn to overthrow the theocracy in Tehran.
The CIA today provides material support
to the actions of the MEK inside Iran.
The recent spate of explosions in Iran,
including a particularly devastating accident involving a military convoy
transporting ammunition in downtown Tehran, appears to be linked to an MEK
operation; its agents working inside munitions manufacturing plants
deliberately are committing acts of sabotage which lead to such explosions.
If CIA money and planning support are behind these actions, the agencys
backing constitutes nothing less than an act of war on the part of the
United States against Iran.
The MEK traces its roots back to the CIA-orchestrated overthrow of the
democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadeg. Formed among
students and intellectuals, the MEK emerged in the 1960s as a serious threat
to the reign of Reza Shah Pahlevi. Facing brutal repression from the
Shahs secret police, the SAVAK, the MEK became expert at blending into
Iranian society, forming a cellular organizational structure which made it
virtually impossible to eradicate.
The MEK membership also became adept at gaining
access to positions of sensitivity and authority. When the Shah was
overthrown in 1978, the MEK played a major role and for a while worked hand
in glove with the Islamic Revolution in crafting a post-Shah Iran. In 1979
the MEK had a central role in orchestrating the seizure of the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran, and holding 55 Americans hostage for 444 days.
However, relations between the MEK and the Islamic regime in Tehran soured,
and after the MEK staged a bloody coup attempt in 1981, all ties were
severed and the two sides engaged in a violent civil war. Revolutionary
Guard members who were active at that time have acknowledged how difficult
it was to fight the MEK.
In the end, massive acts of arbitrary arrest,
torture and executions were required to break the back of mainstream MEK
activity in Iran, although even the Revolutionary Guard today admits the MEK
remains active and is virtually impossible to completely eradicate.
It is this stubborn ability to survive and operate inside Iran, at a time
when no other intelligence service can establish and maintain a meaningful
agent network there, which makes the MEK such an asset to nations such as
the United States and Israel. The MEK is able to provide some useful
intelligence; however, its overall value as an intelligence resource is
negatively impacted by the fact that it is the sole source of human
intelligence in Iran.
As such, the group has taken to exaggerating and
fabricating reports to serve its own political agenda. In this way, there is
little to differentiate the MEK from another Middle Eastern expatriate
opposition group, the Iraqi National Congress, or INC, which
infamously supplied inaccurate intelligence to the United States and other
governments and helped influence the U.S. decision to invade Iraq and
overthrow Saddam Hussein.
Today, the MEK sees itself in a similar role,
providing sole-sourced intelligence to the United States and Israel in an
effort to facilitate American military operations against Iran and,
eventually, to overthrow the Islamic regime in Tehran.
The current situation concerning the MEK would be laughable if it were not
for the violent reality of that organizations activities. Upon its arrival
in Iraq in 1986, the group was placed under the control of Saddam Husseins
Mukhabarat, or intelligence service. The MEK was a heavily
militarized organization and in 1988 participated in division-size military
operations against Iran.
The organization represents no state and can be
found on the U.S. State Departments list of terrorist organizations, yet
since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, the MEK has been under the
protection of the U.S. military. Its fighters are even given protected
status under the Geneva Conventions. The MEK says its members in Iraq are
refugees, not terrorists. And yet one would be hard-pressed to find why the
1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees should confer refugee status on an active
paramilitary organization that uses refugee camps inside Iraq as its
bases.
The MEK is behind much of the intelligence being used by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in building its case
that Iran may be pursuing (or did in fact pursue in the past) a nuclear
weapons program. The complexity of the MEK-CIA relationship was
recently underscored by the agencys acquisition of a laptop computer
allegedly containing numerous secret documents pertaining to an Iranian
nuclear weapons program.
Much has been made about this computer and its
contents. The United States has led the charge against Iran within
international diplomatic circles, citing the laptop information as the
primary source proving Irans ongoing involvement in clandestine nuclear
weapons activity. Of course, the information on the computer, being derived
from questionable sources (i.e., the MEK and the CIA, both sworn enemies of
Iran) is controversial and its veracity is questioned by many, including me.
Now, I have a simple solution to the issue of
the laptop computer:
-
Give it the UNSCOM treatment.
-
Assemble a team of CIA, FBI and Defense
Department forensic computer analysts and probe the computer, byte
by byte.
-
Construct a chronological record of how
and when the data on the computer were assembled.
-
Check the logic of the data, making
sure everything fits together in a manner consistent with the
computers stated function and use.
-
Tell us when the computer was turned on
and logged into and how it was used.
Then, with this complex usage template
constructed, overlay the various themes which have been derived from the
computers contents, pertaining to projects, studies and other activities of
interest. One should be able to rapidly ascertain whether or not the
computer is truly a key piece of intelligence pertaining to Irans nuclear
programs.
The fact that this computer is acknowledged as coming from the MEK and the
fact that a proper forensic investigation would probably demonstrate the
fabricated nature of the data contained are why the U.S. government will
never agree to such an investigation being done. A prosecutor, when making a
case of criminal action, must lay out evidence in a simple, direct manner,
allowing not only the judge and jury to see it but also the accused.
If the evidence is as strong as the prosecutor
maintains, it is usually bad news for the defendant.
However, if the defendant is able to demonstrate
inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the data being presented, then the
prosecution is the one in trouble. And if the defense is able to demonstrate
that the entire case is built upon fabricated evidence, the case is
generally thrown out. This, in short, is what should be done with the IAEAs
ongoing probe into allegations that Iran has pursued nuclear weapons. The
evidence used by the IAEA is unable to withstand even the most rudimentary
cross-examination. It is speculative at best, and most probably fabricated.
Iran has done the right thing in refusing to
legitimize this illegitimate source of information.
A key question that must be asked is why, then, does the IAEA continue to
permit Olli Heinonen, the agencys Finnish deputy director for
safeguards and the IAEA official responsible for the ongoing technical
inspections in Iran, to wage his one-man campaign on behalf of the United
States, Britain and (indirectly) Israel regarding allegations derived from
sources of such questionable veracity (the MEK-supplied laptop computer)?
Moreover, why is such an official given free
rein to discuss such sensitive data with the press, or with politically
motivated outside agencies, in a manner that results in questionable
allegations appearing in the public arena as unquestioned fact? Under normal
circumstances, leaks of the sort that have occurred regarding the ongoing
investigation into Irans alleged past studies on nuclear weapons would be
subjected to a thorough investigation to determine the source and to ensure
that appropriate measures are taken to end them.
And yet, in Vienna, Heinonens repeated
transgressions are treated as a giant non-event, the 800-pound gorilla in
the room that everyone pretends isnt really there.
Heinonen has become the pro-war yin to the anti-confrontation yang of his
boss, IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei. Every time
ElBaradei releases the results of the IAEA probe of Iran, pointing out that
the IAEA can find no evidence of any past or present nuclear weapons
program, and that there is a full understanding of Irans controversial
centrifuge-based enrichment program, Heinonen throws a monkey wrench into
the works. Well-publicized briefings are given to IAEA-based diplomats.
Mysteriously, leaks from undisclosed sources
occur.
Heinonens Finnish nationality serves as a
flimsy cover for neutrality that long ago disappeared. He is no longer
serving in the role as unbiased inspector, but rather a front for the active
pursuit of an American - and Israeli - inspired disinformation campaign
designed to keep alive the flimsy allegations of a nonexistent Iranian
nuclear weapons program in order to justify the continued warlike stance
taken by the U.S. and Israel against Iran.
The fact that the IAEA is being used as a front to pursue this blatantly
anti-Iranian propaganda is a disservice to an organization with a mission of
vital world importance. The interjection of not only the unverified (and
unverifiable) MEK laptop computer data, side by side with a newly placed
emphasis on a document relating to the forming of uranium metal into
hemispheres of the kind useful in a nuclear weapon, is an amateurish
manipulation of data to achieve a preordained outcome.
Calling the Iranian possession of the
aforementioned document alarming, Heinonen (and the media) skipped past
the history of the document, which, of course, has been well explained by
Iran previously as something the Pakistani nuclear proliferator A.Q. Khan
inserted on his own volition to a delivery of documentation pertaining to
centrifuges.
Far from being a top-secret document protected
by Irans security services, it was discarded in a file of old material that
Iran provided to the IAEA inspectors. When the IAEA found the document, Iran
allowed it to be fully examined by the inspectors, and answered every
question posed by the IAEA about how the document came to be in Iran.
For Heinonen to call the document alarming, at
this late stage in the game, is not only irresponsible but factually
inaccurate, given the definition of the word. The Iranian document in
question is neither a cause for alarm, seeing as it is not a source for any
sudden fear brought on by the sense of danger, nor does it provide any
warning of existing or approaching danger, unless one is speaking of the
danger of military action on the part of the United States derived from
Heinonens unfortunate actions and choice of words.
Olli Heinonen might as well become a salaried member of the Bush
administration, since he is operating in lock step with the U.S.
governments objective of painting Iran as a threat worthy of military
action.
Shortly after Heinonens alarmist briefing in
March 2008, the U.S. ambassador to the IAEA, Gregory Schulte, emerged
to announce,
As todays briefing showed us, there are
strong reasons to suspect that Iran was working covertly and
deceitfully, at least until recently, to build a bomb.
Heinonens briefing provided nothing of the
sort, being derived from an irrelevant document and a laptop computer of
questionable provenance. But that did not matter to Schulte, who noted that
Iran has refused to explain or even acknowledge past work on
weaponization.
Schulte did not bother to note that it would be
difficult for Iran to explain or acknowledge that which it has not done.
This is particularly troubling, Schulte
went on, when combined with Irans determined effort to master the
technology to enrich uranium.
Why is this so troubling?
Because, as Schulte noted,
Uranium enrichment is not necessary for
Irans civil program but it is necessary to produce the fissile material
that could be weaponized into a bomb.
This, of course, is the crux of the issue:
Irans ongoing enrichment program. Not because it is illegal; Iran is
permitted to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes under Article IV of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Not again because Irans centrifuge program is
operating in an undeclared, unmonitored fashion; the IAEA had stated it has
a full understanding of the scope and work of the Iranian centrifuge
enrichment program and that all associated nuclear material is accounted for
and safeguarded. The problem has never been, and will never be, Irans
enrichment program.
The problem is American policy objectives of
regime change in Iran, pushed by a combination of American desires for
global hegemony and an activist Israeli agenda which seeks regional
security, in perpetuity, through military and economic supremacy. The
specter of nuclear enrichment is simply a vehicle for facilitating the
larger policy objectives. Olli Heinonen, and those who support and
sustain his work, must be aware of the larger geopolitical context of his
actions, which makes them all the more puzzling and contemptible.
A major culprit in this entire sordid affair is the mainstream media.
Displaying an almost uncanny inability to connect the dots, the editors who
run Americas largest newspapers, and the producers who put together
Americas biggest television news programs, have collectively facilitated
the most simplistic, inane and factually unfounded story lines coming out of
the Bush White House.
The most recent fairy tale was one of
diplomacy, on the part of one William Burns, the No. 3 diplomat in
the State Department.
I have studied the minutes of meetings involving John McCloy, an
American official who served numerous administrations, Democratic and
Republican alike, in the decades following the end of the Second World War.
His diplomacy with the Soviets, conducted with senior Soviet negotiator
Valerein Zorin and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev himself, was
real, genuine, direct and designed to resolve differences.
The transcripts of the diplomacy conducted
between Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho to bring an end to the
Vietnam conflict is likewise a study in the give and take required to
achieve the status of real diplomacy.
Sending a relatively obscure official like Burns to observe a meeting
between the European Union and Iran, with instructions not to interact, not
to initiate, not to discuss, cannot under any circumstances be construed as
diplomacy. Any student of diplomatic history could tell you this. And yet
the esteemed editors and news producers used the term diplomacy, without
challenge or clarification, to describe Burns mission to Geneva on July 19.
The decision to send him there was hailed as a
significant concession on the part of the
Bush administration, a step away from war and an indication
of a new desire within the White House to resolve the Iranian impasse
through diplomacy. How this was going to happen with a diplomat hobbled and
muzzled to the degree Burns was apparently skipped the attention of these
writers and their bosses.
Diplomacy, America was told, was the new policy
option of choice for the Bush administration.
Of course, the Geneva talks produced nothing. The United States had made
sure Europe, through its foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, had no
maneuvering room when it came to the core issue of uranium enrichment: Iran
must suspend all enrichment before any movement could be made on any other
issue. Furthermore, the American-backed program of investigation concerning
the MEK-supplied laptop computer further poisoned the diplomatic waters.
Iran, predictably, refused to suspend its
enrichment program, and rejected the Heinonen-led investigation into nuclear
weaponization, refusing to cooperate further with the IAEA on that matter,
noting that it fell outside the scope of the IAEAs mandate in Iran.
Condoleezza Rice was quick to respond. After a debriefing from Burns,
who flew to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, where Rice was holding
closed-door meetings with the foreign ministers of six Arab nations on the
issue of Iran, Rice told the media that Iran was not serious about
resolving the standoff.
Having played the diplomacy card, Rice moved on
with the real agenda:
If Iran did not fully cooperate with the
international community (i.e., suspend its enrichment program), then it
would face a new round of economic sanctions and undisclosed punitive
measures, both unilaterally on the part of the United States and Europe,
as well as in the form of even broader sanctions from the United Nations
Security Council (although it is doubtful that Russia and China would go
along with such a plan).
The issue of unilateral U.S. sanctions is most
worrisome.
Both the House of Representatives, through HR
362, and the Senate, through SR 580, are preparing legislation that would
call for an air, ground and sea blockade of Iran. Back in October 1962,
President John F. Kennedy, when considering the imposition of a naval
blockade against Cuba in response to the presence of Soviet missiles in that
nation, opined that a blockade is a major military operation, too. Its an
act of war. Which, of course, it is.
The false diplomacy waged by the White House in
Geneva simply pre-empted any congressional call for a diplomatic outreach.
Now the president can move on with the mission of facilitating a larger
war with Iran by legitimizing yet another act of aggression.
One day, in the not-so-distant future, Americans will awake to the reality
that American military forces are engaged in a shooting war with Iran. Many
will scratch their heads and wonder,
How did that happen?
The answer is simple: We all let it happen.
We are at war with Iran right now. We just dont
have the moral courage to admit it.
