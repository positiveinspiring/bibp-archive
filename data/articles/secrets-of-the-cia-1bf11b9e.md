"The CIA is a state-sponsored terrorists
association. You don't look at people as human beings. They are
nothing but pieces on the chessboard."
- Verne Lyon, former CIA agent
Five former CIA agents describe how their
initial pride and enthusiasm at serving their nation turned to anguish and
remorse, as they realized that they were actually subverting democracy and
killing innocent civilians all in the name "national security" and promoting
foreign policy agendas.
