All tyranny needs to gain a foothold
is for people of good conscience to remain silent
(and consciously passive, inactive and willfully uncaring and unaware).
Edmund Burke
In the Western States a weeks long "drill" called JADE/HELM is set to take place.
This is the End Game of plan begun long time ago by the NWO wealthy-elite.

1. The complete destruction of something
JADE HELM has been ongoing for awhile.
First came the infiltration into key communities and local militias and organizations to assess the risk. Second came the report and later deployment of the needed military equipment to the local sheriffs and police departments. We have seen the procurement of arms, ammunition, food and water in crazy amounts and then those supplies were delivered to key locations.
Thomas Mead, the operations planner for the U.S. Army's Jade Helm realistic military training has publicly stated that,
"We have Army Green Berets, Navy Seals, Marine Special Operations Command, the 82nd Airborne Division and we also have some of our interagency partners such as the DEA, FBI and the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) that will be working with us."
Not only is the use of three special operations forces suspicious with regard to Jade Helm, but more notably is the announced use of JPRA, and this is frightening event.
The Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) maintains a series of training school sites whose subject matter includes:
"Prisoners of war; hostages and DETAINEES (emphasis added); evasion and escape; search and rescue; Prison survival techniques and experiences; geography and cartography, natural science, ethnology, and country studies; terrorism; military and Naval science; natural and emergency medicine." (Source)
"Prisoners of war; hostages and DETAINEES (emphasis added); evasion and escape; search and rescue; Prison survival techniques and experiences; geography and cartography, natural science, ethnology, and country studies; terrorism; military and Naval science; natural and emergency medicine."
(Source)
The majority of the above definition makes it clear that the intent of JPRA is to teach POW survival skills, at least until they use the word "detainee".
Please allow me to call your attention to the term "detainee". In layman's language, the term "detainee" simply means someone who is a prisoner of the military occupation force (U.S. government).
To the average person, the use of the term detainee would not raise an eyebrow, but to someone who is tune with the connotations and denotations of military parlance, the term "detainee" holds specific meaning as evidenced by the following document which is considered by many to be a blueprint manual, created by the Army, for martial law and FEMA camp incarceration for political prisoners (e.g. dissenters).

In section 1-10 of 3-39.40, "A Civilian detainee is a civilian who is interned during armed conflict, occupation, or other military operation for security reasons, for protection, or because he or she committed an offense against the detaining power." In section 3-56 of 3-39.40, the following draconian provisions are applied to "detainees": "Develops PSYOP products that are designed to pacify and acclimate detainees or DCs to accept U.S. I/R facility authority and regulations (Author's note: "PSYOP Products" such as the use of torture such as water-boarding and sleep deprivation). Gains the cooperation of detainees to reduce the number of guards needed. Identifies malcontents, trained agitators, and political leaders within the facility who may try to organize resistance or create disturbances. Develops and executes indoctrination programs to reduce or remove antagonistic attitudes (i.e. brainwashing of detainees). Identifies political activists. Plans and executes a PSYOP program that produces an understanding and appreciation of U.S. policies and actions."

Develops and executes indoctrination programs to reduce or remove antagonistic attitudes (i.e. brainwashing of detainees).
Identifies political activists.
Plans and executes a PSYOP program that produces an understanding and appreciation of U.S. policies and actions."
The use of the word "detainee" is conspicuous and as the reader can clearly see, it has specific meaning with regard to a Red List extraction action.
In effect, this is the black site for political dissidents. Both Jade Helm 15 and the FM 3-39.40 are both Army manuals written exclusively on dealing with civilian personnel in martial law settings.
Under the NDAA, designating select citizens as a detainee and holding them indefinitely is legal under this unconstitutional legislation.
Repeated reference is made about the cooperation between the Department of Defense (DoD) and local law enforcement (LEA) in the Jade Helm document. After reading this document, Program 1033 started to make a lot of sense. Program 1033 is the militarization of local police with former military equipment (tanks, machine guns, etc.).
It is interesting to note that it was the NDAA legislation that created Program 1033. Obviously, the purpose of this is to turn the local police into a martial law occupation force.
The trap is set, all is left is to herd us rats into the trap.

The Red States of Utah and Texas are listed as hostile states as is part of Southern California. These states are not geographically contiguous. Subsequently, we are looking at Jade Helm 15 as being the suppression of civil resistance. The use of the 82nd Airborne is also suggestive of the fact that the authorities anticipate that there could be civilian militias rising up, perhaps in combination with veterans groups and possibly military units loyal to the citizens of the United States. The Brown State of New Mexico is listed as leaning towards being hostile. The Blue States of California, Nevada and Colorado are listed as being loyal, "permissive", to military authority and martial law. The Light Blue State of Arizona is listed as "unknown", but leaning toward being friendly.

Operation Jade Helm - Massive Military Drill Across 9 States For "Unconventional Warfare"
Doesn't get much clearer then their emblem states
to "Master the Human Domain!
The mission is vast both geographically and strategically:
Elite service members from four branches of the U.S. military will launch an operation this summer in which they will operate covertly among the U.S. public and travel from state to state in military aircraft.
Texas, Utah and a section of southern California are labeled as hostile territory, and New Mexico isn't much friendlier. That's the scheme for Jade Helm 15, a new Special Operations exercise that runs from July 15 to September 15.
Army Special Operations Command announced it last week, saying the size and scope of the mission sets it apart from many other training exercises.
"The nature of warfare is always changing and U.S. Army Special Operations Command's mission is to make certain the Army's various Special Operations Forces are trained, equipped and organized to successfully conduct worldwide special operations in support of our nation's interests," Army Lt. Col. Mark Lastoria, a command spokesman, said in an e-mail. "Training exercise Jade Helm is going to assist our Special Operations Soldiers and leadership in refining the skills needed against an ever changing foreign threat." (Source)

The JADE HELM 15 Drill is a Martial Law, Civil War an "Red List" Extraction Drill
The term, "unconventional warfare (UW)" makes it clear that this exercise is not dealing with a Russian-backed "Red Dawn" invasion of the Southwestern United States by Russian backed Latin American partners.
UW speaks to the guerrilla warfare (asymmetrical) nature of the anticipated and rehearsed conflict.
Subsequently, it can be conclusively stated that Jade Helm is not preparing for a Red Dawn invasion, rather, they are preparing for a Red, White and Blue invasion.
This is a massive rehearsal for martial law implementation as well as implementing the proverbial and much rumored Red and Blue List and the "snatch and grab" extractions of key resistance figures from the Independent Media as well as uncooperative political figures.
The various provisions of Jade Helm make it clear just how dangerous this drill truly is.
Covert warfare coming to Texas sparks some fears of federal takeover
Among the planned exercises, soldiers will try to operate undetected amongst civilian populations in some towns and cities where residents will be advised to report any suspicious activity they notice as a means of testing the military's effectiveness, said county law enforcement officials who had been briefed by the Army.
"They're going to set up cells of people and test how well they're able to move around without getting too noticed in the community," said Roy Boyd, chief deputy with the Victoria County Sheriff's Office. "They're testing their abilities to basically blend in with the local environment and not stand out and blow their cover."

"They're testing their abilities to basically blend in with the local environment and not stand out and blow their cover."
Lastoria said the Army has been receiving phone calls about the planned exercise,
"from concerned citizens who were provided information taken out of context." "The concerns expressed center around misinterpretations," he said. "Unofficial sources providing inaccurate information on Jade Helm want people to believe that it's it something other than a training exercise."

Sheriffs' deputies said they would make sure local populations are aware of planned exercises, which will involve participants in civilian dress and civilian vehicles, military aircraft, low-altitude airdrops of personnel and weapons with blank rounds, to avert fearful reactions.
A 2013 urban warfare exercise terrified South Houston residents as helicopters and camouflaged men with assault rifles took over Carnegie Vanguard School.
Locals said they had not been warned of a scheduled drill, so they ran for shelter, assuming the worst.
Joint Assistant for Development and Execution (JADE)
Note below Mitre Corp.'s and BBN, A Raytheon Co.'s involvement:
JADE derives its name from the beautiful jade green that colors the island of Oahu in Hawaii where the Pacific Command (PACOM) is headquartered. The acronym JADE stands for Joint Assistant for Deployment and Execution. Its purpose is to assist in the development of force packages (combat forces and supporting forces) that need to be deployed to some location in support of the operational planning and plan execution of a warfighting CINC (Commander in Chief) such as PACOM. Many of the facets of JADE were developed in response to requirements specified by PACOM planners. JADE is the result of a technology integration experiment (TIE) that was initially conducted as part of a joint DARPA/Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) program called DARPI (DARPA Rome Planning Initiative) and later through the DARPA program Planning and Decision Aids (PDA). The experiment involved the linking of the following three independent technologies: Prodigy-Analogy (a combined case-based and generative planner developed by Carnegie Mellon University) ForMAT - Force Management and Analysis Tool (a case-based force deployment planner developed initially at The MITRE Corporation, and subsequently by BBN Technologies); and PARKA (a highly-indexed knowledge based management system developed by the University of Maryland). JADE can be used to support both deliberate and crisis action (time sensitive) planning. JADE software enables a military planner to build a preliminary force deployment plan (TPFDD) in less than one hour. JADE uses a knowledge-intensive planning technique that employs case-based and generative planning methods to handle large-scale, complex plans in minimal time. The tool supports the rapid retrieval and reuse of previous plan data, both deliberate plans and previously developed crisis plans. To support plan development, constraint checking is provided and the results are used to provide the user with reminders of steps to do during the force deployment planning process. SUMMARY JADE can be used to support both deliberate and crisis action planning. [2, 8] JADE software and case-bases enable a military planner to build a preliminary force deployment plan including a TPFDD in less than one hour. JADE is a knowledge-intensive planning technique that employs case-based and generative planning methods to handle large-scale, complex deployment plans in minimal time. Constraint checking is provided during plan development and the results of constraint checking are used to provide the user with reminders during force deployment plan development.

Introduction
The revolutionary development of modern weapons within a world divided by serious ideological differences has produced a crisis in human history. In order to overcome the danger of nuclear war now confronting mankind, the United States has introduced at the Sixteenth General Assembly of the United Nations a Program for General and Complete Disarmament in a Peaceful World.
This new program provides for the progressive reduction of the war-making capabilities of nations and the simultaneous strengthening of international institutions to settle disputes and maintain the peace.
It sets forth a series of comprehensive measures which can and should he taken in order to bring about a world in which there will be freedom from war and security for all states.
It is based on three principles deemed essential to the achievement of practical progress in the disarmament field:
First, there must be immediate disarmament action: A strenuous and uninterrupted effort must be made toward the goal of general and complete disarmament; at the same time, it is important that specific measures be put into effect as soon as possible. Second, all disarmament obligations must be subject to effective international controls: The control organization must have the manpower, facilities, and effectiveness to assure that limitations or reductions take place as agreed. It must also be able to certify to all states that retained forces and armaments do not exceed those permitted at any stage of the disarmament process. Third, adequate peace-keeping machinery must be established: There is an inseparable relationship between the scaling down of national armaments on the one hand and the building up of international peace-keeping machinery and institutions on the other. Nations are unlikely to shed their means of self-protection in the absence of alternative ways to safeguard their legitimate interests.

Is WalMart Store Closings Part of JADE-HELM?
INTELLIHUB
Early last week mega corporation Walmart randomly announced that they would be closing at least five stores for up to six months due to what they described as, "plumbing issues."
With Jade Helm 2015 on the horizon, these abrupt closures instantly sparked fears that they could be connected to the large-scale realistic training drills set to take place in at least seven states.
"Stores in California, Texas, Florida, and Oklahoma closed Tuesday with little to no warning, in some cases without even letting the city know, leaving thousands of people without jobs (Walmart claims employees can move to another store) and sparking widespread theories as to the real reason for the abrupt closures, read an Intellihub special report. The closures may end up being nothing more than simple plumbing issues but when you consider FEMA's past statements and documented plans to use large, empty department stores as holding centers in the event of widespread social unrest or a massive influx of immigrants, they take on a more sinister meaning."

The closures may end up being nothing more than simple plumbing issues but when you consider FEMA's past statements and documented plans to use large, empty department stores as holding centers in the event of widespread social unrest or a massive influx of immigrants, they take on a more sinister meaning."
The use of Green Berets, Navy Seals and Special Operations Command forces speaks to the unconventional composition of the overall makeup of this group.
Among the many duties for these three Special Operations groups include infrastructure raids, assassination of key enemy personnel, reconnaissance, and extraction of key enemy personnel for detention and/or intelligence gathering.
It is the latter duty that has me concerned as there has been much discussion over the execution of a "Red List" in which key resistance figures would be kidnapped and "dealt with" in advance of the implementation of martial law.
A detailed analysis of the language of Jade Helm has convinced me that we are looking at the implementation of the "snatch and grab" of key resistance figures to the coming marital law.
My sources have told me that in past drills of this nature, Red List extraction troops are helicoptered in the early morning hours (e.g. 3AM) land, offload personnel and extract the intended targets, SWAT team style.
In the Jade Helm section entitled "What to Expect", operation planners state that the public should anticipate "Increased aircraft in the area at night", and "May receive noise complaints".
What aircraft would be loud enough at night to guarantee noise complaints? My vote would be the helicopters. And who would be on these helicopters at night? What time are snatch and grab activities historically held? And who typically conducts snatch and grab arrests?
The answer to these questions would be the special operation forces, which in martial law, would be the Gestapo version of the Green Berets, the Navy Seals and Marine Special Forces as they arrive at your home at 3AM.
The Pentagon has been preparing for a massive civil breakdown by conducting studies with major universities titled the "Minerva Research Initiative", which was started the year of the banking crisis, 2008.
Hopefully this drill is simply a drill, nothing more, providing time for those who still need it. But with the government and military preparing for something along the lines of a Second Civil War, we all know it's only a matter of time till hostilities begin.
FROM Dave Hodges at Common Sense Radio
With regard to the thematic components to this article, there is no conclusion, this is only the beginning.
It is quite clear that the Army fully believes, as do their superiors at the Pentagon and at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that there is the belief that there is going to be something so catastrophic that an American Civil War II will ensue.
The reasons behind this event(s) are not the focus of this article. However, I think it is a safe bet that it will have to do with the seizure of bank accounts and retirement accounts. This is a topic that will be explored in a future article.
Meanwhile, Americans in the Southwest need to be concerned that this drill does not go live like so many of these drills seem to in advance of a false flag drill. Every political activist, "uncooperative" politician and member of the Independent Media need to be thinking about where they want to be from July 15 to September 15.
It would be best to be where "they" aren't!
Who's Really Behind it All
The JASON Society, or JASON Scholars, takes its name from the story of Jason and the Golden Fleece, and it is a branch of the Order of the Quest, one of the highest degrees in the Illuminati.
The golden fleece takes on the role of truth to the JASON members. Jason represents the search for truth.
Therefore the name JASON Society denotes a group of men who are engaged in a search for the truth. The name Jason is spelled with capital letters when used as the name of the JASON Society. Lower-case letters are never used when referring to this secret group. The name may even have deeper meaning, as the name "Jason" and the Golden Fleece appear throughout history in relation to various other secret societies.
In these instances the story represents man (Jason) looking for himself (Golden Fleece).
Top Secret documents that I read while with the Naval Intelligence stated that President Eisenhower had commissioned the JASON Society to examine all of the evidence, facts, lies, and deception and find the truth of the alien question.
Founders of the JASON Group (or JASON Society) include members of the famous Manhattan Project, which brought together almost every leading physicist in the nation to build the atomic bomb during World War II. The group is made up mostly of theoretical physicists and is the most elite gathering of scientific minds in the United States.
As of 1987 the membership included four Nobel Prize winners. Today JASON continues to offer scientific help the government cannot find anywhere else. They are probably the only group of scientists in the United States that know the true state of highest technology.
JASON is shrouded in what appears to be unnecessary secrecy. The group refuses to release its membership list, none of the members list JASON membership on there official resumes. Working completely behind the scenes, JASON has guided the nation's most important security decisions. These include, but are not limited to, Star Wars, Submarine Warfare, and predictions about the greenhouse effect. The JASON members are paid $500.00 per-day consultant's fee.
According to the Pentagon, the JASONS hold the highest and most restrictive security clearances in the nation. They are given the protocol rank of rear admiral (two stars) when they visit of travel aboard ships or visit military bases. The only other reference to the JASON group that I have been able to find is in the Pentagon Papers.
The veil of secrecy around the JASON Group has been so tight and so leak-proof since its conception that those who think the government cannot keep a secret need to reexamine that position. The government was able to contain the JASON secret except the one leak; but the JASON Group itself, a civilian group, did even better.
JASON is administered by the Mitre Corporation Government contracts allotted to the Mitre Corporation are in reality allotted to the JASON scientist. This is done so that the name JASON does not ever appear in documents which may come under public scrutiny.
