The Corruption Perceptions Index
(CPI)
table shows a country's ranking and score, the number of surveys
used to determine the score, and the confidence range of the
scoring.
-
The rank shows how one country compares
to others included in the index. The CPI score indicates the
perceived level of public-sector corruption in a country/territory.
-
The CPI is based on 13 independent
surveys. However, not all surveys include all countries. The surveys
used column indicates how many surveys were relied upon to determine
the score for that country.
-
The confidence range indicates the
reliability of the CPI scores and tells us that allowing for a
margin of error, we can be 90% confident that the true score for
this country lies within this range.
