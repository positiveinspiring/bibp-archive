Over the past two years,
Coinbase has made it
easy to
use bitcoin.
Over 1.6 million consumers, 36,000 merchants and
6,000 developers have signed up to use our product. While people
all over the world have made use of the Coinbase wallet, the
U.S. has been our fastest area of growth, largely due to our
integration with the U.S. banking system which makes it easy for
people to buy and sell bitcoin.
Other markets have not grown as quickly because
people have been unable to buy and sell in their local country.
Today, we're looking to change this. Coinbase is
now available in 14
countries.
We're adding 13 additional countries across
Europe including,
-
Italy
-
Spain
-
France
-
Belgium
-
the Netherlands
-
Austria
-
Cyprus
-
Finland
-
Greece
-
Latvia
-
Malta
-
Portugal
-
Slovakia
We've also create a new
Global page showing the
countries where Coinbase is now available:
What does this mean?
Consumers and businesses in these countries can
now buy bitcoin from Coinbase or sell bitcoin to Coinbase using
a euro bank account.
It's important to note that this is a beta launch
in Europe. During our beta, we will have a fairly low daily
limit: 500 per day on buys and sells. We hope to continue
raising this limit in the near future as we move out of beta.
This 500 per day limit is available to 100% of
customers in those countries today, however, and it is not a
closed beta.
We think launching in these additional countries
is a major step for the entire Bitcoin community, and will help
continue bitcoin's growth as a global payment network.
Specifically, we feel having an easy buy/sell
method in these countries will help two important areas of
bitcoin to grow:
-
We believe this launch will accelerate
merchant adoption in Europe, now that many more
consumers have easy access to bitcoin
-
We feel this will also accelerate the use
case of cross border payments for bitcoin
