As with many "terrorism"
related events since 9/11, the Boston bombing official
narrative proves to be a web of lies as important facts
are revealed.
It turns out that the FBI
has lied about its knowledge of the alleged suspects,
Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, already being presented
as guilty not only in the mainstream press but by the
President himself.
According to the suspects mother, the FBI had
been following them for years:
The FBI originally feigned ignorance over
the identity of the two Boston bombing suspects, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev, as they appealed to an unwitting public to help them "identify"
and "find" the suspects. [
]
Russia Today, in an article titled, "They
were set up, FBI followed them for years- Tsarnaevs mother to RT,"
stated of the suspects mother:
But her biggest suspicion surrounding the case
was the constant FBI surveillance she said her family was subjected to over
the years. She is surprised that having been so stringent with the entire
family, the FBI had no idea the sons were supposedly planning a terrorist
act.
She would say of the FBI to Russia Today:
They used to come [to our] home, they used to
talk to me
they were telling me that he [the older, 26-y/o Tamerlan] was
really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him.
They told me
whatever information he is getting, he gets from these extremist sites
they
were controlling him, they were controlling his every step
and now they say
that this is a terrorist act! Never ever is this true, my sons are innocent!
[
] The FBI would then be forced to concede that
indeed it had interviewed the suspects, in 2011, two years before the Boston
bombings.

Boston Bombing Suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev Reported Killed, Was Alive When
Detained: Tamerlans Aunt, Global Research, April 22, 2013.)
We were also told that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was
killed in an exchange of gunfire after he and his brother had robbed a
7-Eleven:
When the shootout ended, one of the suspects,
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, a former boxer, had been
shot and fatally
wounded. He was wearing explosives, several law enforcement
officials said.
(Katharine Q. Seelye, William K. Rashbaum and
Michael Cooper
2nd Bombing Suspect Caught After Frenzied Hunt Paralyzes Boston, The New
York Times, April 19, 2013.)
With a bomb strapped to his chest, one of the
Boston Marathon suspects was killed early Friday
after he and his accomplice brother robbed
a 7-Eleven, shot a police officer
to death, carjacked an SUV and hurled explosives in an extraordinary
firefight with law enforcement, authorities told NBC News.
(Pete Williams, Richard Esposito, Michael
Isikoff and Erin McClam, NBC News,
One Boston Marathon suspect killed; second suspect, his brother, on loose
after firefight, NBC News, April 19, 2013.)
The events surrounding Tamerlans death
reported by the media are simply not true.
It turns out that Tamerlan aunt
identified him as a,
"naked,
cuffed, clearly alive and well detainee seen
in video aired by CNN":
Boston Suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev Arrested Stripped Naked.
So, WHEN was he shot and killed?
Tamerlan
Tsarnaev in custody
Was Tamerlan
Assassinated?
The Boston Globe confirmed that Marathon Bombing
suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev was in custody, contradicting earlier reports that
he had been killed in crossfire.
If he was in custody and is now dead, does that
not suggest that he might have been the object of an extrajudicial
assassination? The circumstances of his death remain to be clarified.
Moreover, the 7-Eleven robbery was actually
unrelated to the Tsarnaev brothers:
There was a 7-Eleven robbery in Cambridge last
night, but it had
nothing to do with the Boston Marathon bombing suspects.
Margaret Chabris, the director
of corporate communication at 7- Eleven, says the surveillance
video of the crime was not taken at a 7-Eleven and that the suspect that did
rob the 7-Eleven does not look like Tamerlan or Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
"The suspect in the photos for that particular
7-Eleven robbery looks nothing like the suspects," Chabris
says. "The police or someone made a mistake. Someone was confused."
[
] Again, they might be guilty. But as Glenn
Greenwald notes:
The overarching principle here should be that
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is entitled to a presumption of innocence until he is
actually proven guilty.
As so many cases have proven - from accused (but
exonerated) anthrax
attacker Stephen Hatfill to accused (but exonerated) Atlanta
Olympic bomber Richard Jewell to dozens
if not hundreds of Guantanamo detainees accused of being the "worst of
the worst" but who were guilty of nothing - people who appear to be guilty
based on government accusations and trials-by-media are often completely
innocent.
Media-presented evidence is no substitute for
due process and an adversarial trial.
(Washingtons Blog,
Boston Terror Narrative Starts Falling Apart, Global Research, April 23,
2013)
On April 19 Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested
and brought to a hospital.
According to
Reuters,
"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was
wounded during at least one of two gun
battles with police on Friday, suffering gunshot wounds to
his head, neck, legs and hand [...]".
On April 24, the Huffington Post reported:
Two U.S. officials say the surviving suspect in
the Boston bombings was unarmed when police captured him
hiding inside a boat in a neighborhood back yard.
Authorities
originally said they had exchanged gunfire with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for more
than one hour Friday evening before they were able to subdue
him.
(Adam Goldman and Pete Yost, Boston
Bombing Suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Reportedly Unarmed When Arrested In Boat,
Officials Say, Huffington Post, April 24, 2013.)
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was unarmed
and obviously brutalized by police
We still dont know what really happened in
Boston and who committed the attacks even though the mainstream media report
that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has admitted being guilty.
What we know for sure is that the official
Boston bombing narrative is filled with lies and that
since 9/11 and in the
context of the fictitious "War on Terror", Western governments, intelligence
agencies and mainstream media have proven to be untrustworthy sources of
information on alleged "terrorist attacks" or "foiled terrorist plots".
Canadas Complicity in
the War on Terror
Three days after Boston was locked down, invaded
by a colossal police-military apparatus on a surreal "teenagehunt", the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police made a very timely announcement:
they had
foiled a terrorist plot targeting a Via Rail passenger train.
Or so they say...
In a very absurd press conference where three
RCMP officers repeatedly answered questions with,
"we cannot comment as the investigation is
ongoing", the only information they seemed very eager to disclose was
that the suspects "received guidance from Al-Qaeda in Iran".
RCMP
press conference
While the Canadian mainstream media take these
RCMP allegations at face value, independent news outlets suspect hidden
political motives behind the highly publicized announcement:
Neither the police nor government have given any
reason as to why, after allowing the accused to remain at large for months,
they were suddenly arrested Monday afternoon and in a very high-profile
manner. [
]
Speaking Tuesday after Jasers arraignment in a
Toronto court, his lawyer, John Norris, drew attention to the timing of the
police-government announcement that they had uncovered Canadas first
"al-Qaeda-sponsored" terror plot.
Said Norris,
"The timing of the arrest is a bit of a
mystery and certainly I would like to hear the RCMPs explanation for
that. They have been very clear that there is no risk of public safety
and it is surprising to say the least that this arrest would be made
now, close on the heels of what happened in Boston and timed perfectly
with what was happening in the House of Commons yesterday."
On Friday, the Conservative government announced
that it was changing the House of Commons agenda, scheduling third and
final reading of its "Combating Terrorism Act" (Bill S-7) to begin Monday
and conclude this week. Bill S-7 gives the state vast new powers.
These include:
-
the right to hold terrorism suspects for
72 hours without charge
-
to convene "investigative hearings" at
which those believed to have information about an imminent terrorist
attack are stripped of their right to remain silent
-
the power to place restrictions for up
to a year on the movements and rights of persons deemed by the state
to be terrorist suspects but against whom they have insufficient
evidence to lay charges. [
]
US authorities have been quick to trumpet the
Canadian claims of a thwarted terrorist attack - claims that boost their own
efforts to portray North America as under siege from terrorists and justify
a vast expansion of the national-security apparatus and coercive powers of
the state.
The US ambassador to Canada, David Jacobson,
issued a statement Monday saying the arrests of Esseghaier and Jaser "were
the result of extensive cross-border cooperation" and had underscored "that
we face serious and real threats." [
]
At Mondays press conference, the RCMP asserted
that Esseghaier and Jaser had acted under the "direction and guidance" of
"al-Qaeda elements located in Iran."
The RCMP said that they had no evidence of
Iranian government involvement. [
]
The Harper Conservative government, which has
declared itself Israels strongest ally and has expanded Canadas decades
old military-strategic alliance with Washington, broke off diplomatic
relations with Teheran last summer.
In justifying this action, Conservative Foreign
Minister John Baird labeled Iran,
"the most significant threat to global
peace and security in the world today."
(Keith Jones
Canadian Government unveils "Terror Plot" as it Adopts Draconian New Law,
World Socialist Web Site, April 24, 2013.)
We may recall a "terrorist plot" revealed in
late November 2001.
According to mainstream reports, Ahmed Ressam,
who was convicted of plotting to bomb Los Angeles International Airport in
1999, had also planned to bomb a Montreal area with,
"the most visible concentration of Jews in
Canada - a vibrant area of some 5,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews who stand out
because of their traditional outfits of black coats and hats for men,
long skirts and wigs for women."
(Ingrid Peritz,
Montreals brush with terror, The Globe and Mail, November 30,
2001.)
The Globe stated further:
Members of the Hasidic community in Outremont
responded with shock after hearing that Mr. Ressam and Samir Ait Mohamed
wanted to detonate a bomb in the area because it was predominantly Jewish.
The stated choice of explosives - a bomb on a
gasoline truck - evoked the detonating power of the fuel-laden planes that
ripped through the World Trade Center.
(Ibid.)
Samir Aït Mohamed happened to be a fake Algerian
refugee and,
"an informant for Canadian law-enforcement
authorities [RCMP]."
(Mike Carter,
Montreal bomb plot revealed in Ressam case documents, Seattle Times,
November 30, 2001.)
The Canadian Security Intelligence Service
(CSIS) was also involved in a terrorist plot.
Joseph Gilles Breault, a.k.a.
Youssef Mouammar or Abou Djihad, had threatened to attack the Montreal metro
with a biochemical weapon in 1998. He was a
CSIS agent.
With that in mind, the latest RCMP "exploit"
raises even more questions on this revived Al-Qaeda threat focused on Iran.
Whos behind Al-Qaeda in Iran?:
As the FBI reels from what now appears to be
revelations it
was directly involved in the Boston Marathon bombings, a deluge of FBI
"success" stories have been "serendipitously" splashed across Western
headlines.
Among them was an allegedly "foiled" terror
attack in Canada, reported to be the work of terrorists supported by
"Al-Qaeda operatives in Iran."
The Globe and Mail, in its report, "Canada
joins U.S. in alleging al-Qaeda has operatives based in Iran," states:
[
] The Sunni-based al-Qaeda and Shia Iran
belong to different branches of Islam that have been at odds historically.
But in recent years U.S. officials have formally alleged that Iran has
allowed al-Qaeda members to operate out of its territory."
[
] Hersh in his 2008 New Yorker piece titled, "Preparing
the Battlefield: The Bush Administration steps up its secret moves against
Iran," spelled out a damning indictment of US involvement in bolstering,
arming, and funding terror organizations, not linked to, but described as
actually being Al Qaeda [...]:
One of
the most active and violent anti-regime groups in Iran today is the
Jundallah, also known as the Iranian Peoples
Resistance Movement, which describes itself as a resistance force fighting
for the rights of Sunnis in Iran.
"This is a vicious Salafi organization whose
followers attended the same madrassas as the Taliban and Pakistani
extremists," Nasr told me. "They are
suspected of having links to Al Qaeda and they are also thought to be
tied to the drug culture."
The Jundallah took responsibility for the
bombing of a busload of Revolutionary Guard soldiers in February, 2007.
At least eleven Guard members were killed.
According to Baer and to press reports, the
Jundallah is among the groups in Iran that are benefiting from U.S. support.
(Tony Cartalucci,
Who is Behind "Al Qaeda in Iran"?, Global Research, April 23, 2013.)
Otherwise the brothers links to Chechen
terrorists makes very little sense, since the latter, like many other
terrorist groups and/or so-called freedom fighters depending on the strategy
of the day, have been supported by the US:
What is abundantly clear is that the US
government is not committed to fighting terrorists.
Quite the opposite. US intelligence has been
recruiting and grooming terrorists for more than thirty years, while at same
time upholding the absurd notion that these terrorists, who are bona fide
CIA "intelligence assets", constitute a threat to the American Homeland.
These alleged threats by "An Outside Enemy" are
part of a propaganda ploy behind the "Global War on Terrorism" (GWOT).
[...] The development of an Islamist terrorist
militia in different countries around the World is part of an intricate US
intelligence project.
While the Tsarnaev brothers are casually
accused without evidence of having links to Chechen terrorists, the
important question is who is behind the Chechen
terrorists?
In an utterly twisted logic, the protagonists of
the Global War on Terrorism" directed against Muslims are the de facto
architects of "Islamic terrorism."
(Michel Chossudovsky,
BOSTON TRUTH: The "Chechen Connection", Al Qaeda and the Boston Marathon
Bombings, Global Research, April 22, 2013.)
Even former US Ambassador Craig Murray says the
"Chechen Connexion" story is surreal:
We are asked to believe that Tamerlan
Tsarnaev was identified by the Russian government as an extremist
Dagestani or Chechen Islamist terrorist, and they were so concerned about it
that in late 2010 they asked the US government to take action.
At that time, the US and Russia did not normally
have a security cooperation relationship over the Caucasus, particularly
following the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. For the Russians to ask
the Americans for assistance, Tsarnaev must have been high on their list of
worries.
In early 2011 the FBI interview Tsarnaev and
trawl his papers and computers but apparently - remarkably for somebody
allegedly radicalised by internet - the habitually paranoid FBI find nothing
of concern.
So far, so weird. But now this gets utterly
incredible. In 2012 Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who is of such concern to Russian
security, is able to fly to Russia and pass through the airport security
checks of the worlds most thoroughly and brutally efficient security
services without being picked up.
He is then able to proceed to Dagestan - right
at the heart of the worlds heaviest military occupation and the worlds
most far reaching secret police surveillance - again without being
intercepted, and he is able there to go through some form of terror training
or further Islamist indoctrination. He then flies out again without any
intervention by the Russian security services.
That is the official story and I have no doubt
it did not happen. I know Russia and I know the Russian security services.
Whatever else they may be, they are extremely well-equipped, experienced and
efficient and embedded into a social fabric accustomed to cooperation with
their mastery.
This scenario is simply impossible in the real
world.
(Craig Murray, The
Boston Bombings and the FBI: "Official Tsarnaev Story Makes No Sense", 21st
Century Wire, April 22, 2013.)
The idea that Tamerlan was, in fact, a US
intelligence asset seems closer to the truth, since according to a Russian
newspaper, he attended a US-sponsored workshop in the Caucasus, the goal of
which was to destabilize southern regions of Russia:
Today, Russian newspaper Izvestia alleges that
the older Boston Tamarlan bombing brother attended a workshop - sponsored by
an American organization -
on destabilizing the Russian satellite states:
At the disposal of "Izvestia" has documents
Counterintelligence Department Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia,
confirming that the Georgian organization "Fund of Caucasus" [here's
their website], which cooperates with the U.S. non-profit
organization "Jamestown" (the board of directors of NGOs previously
entered one of the ideologists of U.S. foreign policy, Zbigniew
Brzezinski), was engaged in recruiting residents North Caucasus to work
in the interests of the United States and Georgia.
According to the reports of Colonel Chief
Directorate Counterintelligence Department Ministry of Internal Affairs
of Georgia Gregory Chanturia to the Minister of Internal Affairs Irakli
Garibashvili, "Caucasian fund" in
cooperation with the Foundation "Jamestown" in the summer of 2012
conducted workshops and seminars for young people of the Caucasus,
including its Russian part.
Some of
them attended Tsarnaev Tamerlane, who was in Russia from
January to July 2012.
"Caucasian fund" writes Tchanturia was
established November 7, 2008, just after the Georgian-Ossetian conflict,
"to control the processes taking place
in the North Caucasus region."
Accordingly, the Department of the Interior
Ministry counterintelligence case was brought intelligence operations
called "DTV".
Main purpose is to
recruit young people and intellectuals of the North Caucasus to enhance
instability and extremism in the southern regions of Russia.
(Washingtons Blog,
Was Boston Bomber "Radicalized" at a U.S.
Sponsored Counterterrorism Workshop, Global Research, April
24, 2013.)
Overall, the Boston tragedy is clearly and sadly
being exploited to revamp the "War on terror", justify the police state
apparatus in the US and other Western countries such as Canada, and
legitimize attacks on our rights and liberties.
