In a riveting
interview on TruNews Radio,
Wednesday, private investigator Doug Hagmann said high-level,
reliable sources told him the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) is preparing for massive civil war in America.
Folks, were getting ready for one massive
economic collapse, Hagmann told TruNews host Rick Wiles.
We have problems... The federal government is preparing for civil
uprising, he added, so every time you hear about troop movements,
every time you hear about movements of military equipment, the
militarization of the police, the buying of the ammunition, all of this
is... they (DHS) are preparing for a massive uprising.
Hagmann goes on to say that his sources tell him
the concerns of the DHS stem from a collapse of the U.S. dollar and the
hyperinflation a collapse in the value of the worlds primary reserve
currency implies to a nation of 311 million Americans, who, for the
significant portion of the population, is armed.
Uprisings in Greece is, indeed, a problem, but an uprising of armed
Americans becomes a matter of serious national security, a point addressed
in a recent report by the Pentagon and highlighted as a vulnerability and
threat to the U.S. during war-game exercises at the Department of Defense
last year, according to one of the DoDs war-game participants, Jim
Rickards, author of Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global
Crisis.
Through his sources, Hagmann confirmed Rickards ongoing thesis of a fear of
a U.S. dollar collapse at the hands of the Chinese (U.S. treasury bond
holders of approximately $1 trillion) and, possibly, the Russians
(threatening to launch a gold-backed ruble as an attractive alternative to
the U.S. dollar) in retaliation for aggressive U.S. foreign policy
initiatives against Chinas and Russias strategic allies Iran and Syria.
The one source that we have Ive known
since 1979, Hagmann continued.
He started out as a patrol officer and
currently he is now working for a federal agency under the umbrella of
the Department of Homeland Security; hes in a position to know what
policies are being initiated, what policies are being planned at this
point, and hes telling us right now - look, what youre seeing is just
the tip of the iceberg. We are preparing, we, meaning the government, we
are preparing for a massive civil war in this country.
Theres no hyperbole here, he added, echoing Trends Research
Institutes Founder Gerald Celentes forecast of last year.
Celente expects a collapse of the U.S.
dollar and riots in America some time this year.
Since Celentes Civil War prediction of last year, executive orders NDAA
and National Defense Resources Preparedness were signed into law by
President Obama, which are both politically damaging actions taken by a
sitting president.
And most recently, requests made by the DHS for the procurement of 450
million rounds of hollow-point ammunition only fuels speculation of an
upcoming tragic event expected on American soil.
These major events, as shocking to the American people as they are, have
taken place during an election year.
Escalating preparatory activities by the executive branch and DHS throughout
the last decade - from the Patriot Act, to countless executive orders
drafted to suspend (or strip) American civil liberties are just the
beginning of the nightmare to come, Hagmann said.
He added,
Its going to get so much worse toward the
election, and Im not even sure were going to have an election in this
country. Its going to be that bad, and this, as well, is coming from my
sources.
But one source in particular said, look,
you dont understand how bad it is. This stuff is real; these people,
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), they are ready to fight the
American people.
TruNews Wiles asked Hagmann:
who does the DHS expect to fight, in
particular? Another North versus South, the Yankees against the
Confederates?
Hagmann stated the situation is far worse than a
struggle between any two factions within the U.S.; its an anticipated
nationwide emergency event centered on the nations currency.
What they [DHS] are expecting, and again,
this is according to my sources, what theyre expecting is the
un-sustainability of the American dollar, Hagmann said.
And we know for a fact that we can no
longer service our debt. Theres going to be a period of
hyperinflation... the dollar will be worthless... The economic collapse
will be so severe, people wont be ready for this.
