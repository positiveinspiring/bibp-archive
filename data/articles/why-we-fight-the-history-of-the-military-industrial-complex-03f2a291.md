Inspired by Dwight Eisenhower's legendary farewell speech (in which he coined the phrase 'military industrial complex'), filmmaker Jarecki surveys the scorched landscape of a half-century's military adventures, asking how and telling why a nation of, by, and for the people has become the savings-and-loan of a system whose survival depends on a state of constant war. "Why We Fight" moves beyond the headlines of various American military operations to the deeper questions of,
Why, why does America fight? What are the forces - political, economic, and ideological - that drive them to fight against an ever-changing enemy?

When people discuss the sinister reasons for the Iraq war oil is usually mentioned. But it seems that one huge potential reason is overlooked.
Wars use expensive weapons and arms.
Corporations gain from the sale of these weapons through increased revenues, profits and stock prices. Military companies support politicians that are expected to keep their interests in mind. And the bill for these weapons comes directly from the government to U.S. taxpayers.

This is not a far-fetched conspiracy but simply the natural evolution of business when checks and balances are not in place.
This film investigates the history of 'The Military Industrial Complex'...
Directed by Eugene Jarecki, a 2005 documentary film about the military-industrial complex.
The title refers to the World War II-era eponymous propaganda movies commissioned by the U.S. Government to justify their decision to enter the war against the Axis Powers.
'Why We Fight' was first screened at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival on 17 January 2005, exactly forty-four years after President Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address.
Although it won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary, it received a limited public cinema release on 22 January 2006, and then was released on DVD on 27 June 2006, by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.
The documentary also won one of the 2006 Grimme Awards in the competition "Information & Culture"; the prize is one of Germany's most prestigious for television productions.
'Why We Fight' describes the rise and maintenance of the United States military-industrial complex and its 50-year involvement with the wars led by the United States to date, especially its 2003 Invasion of Iraq.
The documentary asserts that in every decade since World War II, the American public was misled so that the government (incumbent Administration) could take them to war and fuel the military-industrial economy maintaining American political dominance in the world.
