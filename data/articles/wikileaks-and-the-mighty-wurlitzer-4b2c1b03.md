What is the 'Mighty
Wurlitzer'?
It used to be the honorific of Frank Wisner, the first chief of political
warfare for the Central Intelligence Agency, used to describe the C.I.A.s
plethora of front organizations and newsmedia stooges that he was capable of
playing (like a great organ with many keyboards) for synthesizing any
propaganda tune that was needed for the day. See
Operation Mockingbird .
The fact that such an omnipresent Message-Machine is not ancient history but
very much current affairs, is underscored by this NYT headline Behind
TV Analysts, Pentagons Hidden Hand, Sunday, April 20, 2008.
Therefore, today, I use the term 'Mighty Wurlitzer' as a metaphor to
pluralistically refer to the same message-machine, i.e., the intelligence
apparatus for manufacturing consent and controlling dissent, and its
concomitant conscious manipulation of peoples' thoughts, feelings, actions
and in-actions, in order to serve the primacy interests of the ruling-elite.
The latter are, invariably, also the de facto
owners of the complete messaging-system now even more globally ubiquitous
than when Frank Wisner played the world for a fool.
This 'grand organ' is now able to even more effectively synthesize, implant,
and reinforce, all the right set of beliefs (myths) among the entire world's
public - by suitably combining 'events' with imaginative 'expos' writing -
which appropriately primes the world populations to acquiesce to the
oligarchic agendas.
While playing this orchestra is now an integral
part of all state-craft, its major musical themes are entirely determined by
the behind the scenes owners of the system. While some might refer to the
underlying techniques as propaganda and psy-ops, 'Mighty Wurlitzer'
singularly captures the messaging-system controlled under a unified purpose
of command which is both highly compartmentalized and cellularized.
Only the Mighty Wurlitzer knows the entire tune.
What this means is that not all who willingly cooperate with the Mighty
Wurlitzer in synchronistically humming its themes are knowingly being
purveyors of its myths and deception.
Many of its most shrill echoers are often well
intentioned functionaries who are fed different motivating myths at
different levels in the hierarchy - sometimes the lie is different at every
level - such that it suitably motivates each according to their own
predilection, professional station, and mission statement.
The Mighty Wurlitzer operates on the core premise which has been empirically
shown to psychologically motivate most human action.
That premise was elegantly captured in the
following insightful observation made at the so called Terrorism Study
Group, that,
'Public Assumptions' Shape Views of
History: Such presumptions are beliefs (1) thought to be true (although
not necessarily known to be true with certainty), and (2) shared in
common within the relevant political community. The sources for such
presumptions are both personal (from direct experience) and vicarious
(from books, movies, and myths).
Successfully implanting such presumptions and
pre-suppositions among any group is to motivate its overall actions in
accordance with those implanted beliefs. Thus, many intelligent peoples for
whom it is otherwise inexplicable to understand why they persist in 'United
We Stand' with absurdities, are motivated to react sympathetically to those
absurdities.
To barely catch a glimpse of how it's partially done, the following
description by Col. Fletcher Prouty from the Preface to the first
edition of his 1973 book The Secret Team is instructive:
'There is another category of writer and
self-proclaimed authority on the subjects of secrecy, intelligence, and
containment. This man is the suave, professional parasite who gains a
reputation as a real reporter by disseminating the scraps and "Golden
Apples" thrown to him by the great men who use him.
This writer seldom knows and rarely cares
that many of the scraps from which he draws his material have been
planted, that they are controlled leaks, and that he is being used, and
glorified as he is being used, by the inside secret intelligence
community.
Allen Dulles had a penchant for cultivating a number of such writers
with big names and inviting them to his table for a medieval style
luncheon in that great room across the hall from his own offices in the
old CIA headquarters on the hill overlooking Foggy Bottom. Here, he
would discuss openly and all too freely the same subjects that only
hours before had been carefully discussed in the secret inner chambers
of the operational side of that quiet Agency.
In the hands of Allen Dulles, "secrecy" was
simply a chameleon device to be used as he saw fit and to be applied to
lesser men according to his schemes. It is quite fantastic to find
people like Daniel Ellsberg being charged with leaking official secrets
simply because the label on the piece of paper said "top secret," when
the substance of many of the words written on those same papers was
patently untrue and no more than a cover story.
Except for the fact that they were official
lies, these papers had no basis in fact, and therefore no basis to be
graded top secret or any other degree of classification.
Allen Dulles would tell similar cover
stories to his coterie of writers, and not long thereafter they would
appear in print in some of the most prestigious papers and magazines in
the country, totally unclassified, and of course, cleverly untrue.
In every case, the chance for complete information is very small, and
the hope that in time researchers, students, and historians will be able
to ferret out truth from untruth, real from unreal, and story from cover
story is at best a very slim one. Certainly, history teaches us that one
truth will add to and enhance another; but let us not forget that one
lie added to another lie will demolish everything. This is the important
point. Consider the past half century.
How many major events -- really major events
-- have there been that simply do not ring true? How many times has the
entire world been shaken by alarms of major significance, only to find
that the events either did not happen at all, or if they did, that they
had happened in a manner quite unlike the original story?'
Coldly implicit in Col. Prouty's afore-quoted
empirical statement:
and the hope that in time researchers,
students, and historians will be able to ferret out truth from untruth,
real from unreal, and story from cover story is at best a very slim
one,
...is the Machiavellian notion of sewing faits
accompli in current affairs by straight-jacketing all public discourse in
deception, and leaving the ferreting out of 'truth' to future generation of
scholars and historians when separating myths from the calculus of hegemony
can at best only be a bogus academic exercise entirely irrelevant to
reversing the faits accompli already sewn.

Wikileaks and the
Mighty Wurlitzer driving Imperial Mobilization
A pertinent example of Col. Fletcher Prouty's fabricated leaks noted above,
is the Wikileaks' July 2010 disclosures of 'The Afghanistan Papers' which
revealed nothing new.
Wikileaks has always been a rather transparent Mighty Wurlitzer ops. It is
trivial to see through the absurdity of its existence despite it promoting
itself as being a sort of watchdog upon the empire, and therefore,
ostensibly, being inimical to its unbridled quest for full spectrum
dominance - just like Al Jazeera television based in Qatar, which too,
absurdly enough, is permitted to function unhindered in the same nation as
America's CENTCOM headquarters.
Would it not be trivial for an armed to the
teeth National Security State to take-out either apparatus rather trivially?
And that may happen once the useful idiots have outlived their utility, for
he who sups with the devil must have a long spoon!
The reason each is allowed to function is of course social engineering, the
sine qua non for waging modern warfare upon civilian populations by way of
deception.
It spans the entire gamut of engineering
consent, from mantra creation in the mainstream and diabolically controlling
dissent in order to control all opposition, to actually fabricating the
visible pretexts which can naturally ripen the conditions for the mantra of
clash of civilizations to be called real before the Western public in
order to sustain the otherwise untenable imperial mobilization.
Zbigniew Brzezinski
had most succinctly summed up this motivation in his book
The Grand Chessboard - American
Primacy and its Geostrategic Imperatives:
Democracy is inimical to imperial
mobilization.
How can one tell manufactured reportage and fabricated leaks from the real
stuff? How can one see through the Mighty Wurlitzer?
As daunting as it might appear to the mainstream television watcher, it is
in fact rather straightforward for those unencumbered by blind faith in
governments and its statecraft.
Just look for the core-lies and unquestioned
axioms of empire that are typically retained in the leaks and reportage
which, in order to sound credible, often openly expose what is mostly
already known anyway or judiciously employ some variation of Limited
Hangout wrapped in a veneer of dissent or 'freedom of the press'.
Its the exact same recipe as is used by all the other fabricated and
controlled dissent assets of empire when they are not outright spinning
patent lies, for spinning half-truths requires far more brilliance.
It is not for nothing that James Jesus Angleton,
Head of CIA Counter Intelligence 1954-1974, is quoted in the
1992 BBC-2
Documentary on Operation Gladio:
Deception is a state of mind and the mind
of the State.
Wikileaks Afghanistan - Osama bin Laden alive
Osama bin Laden is alive and
playing a key role in directing the war in Afghanistan, leaked US
military files suggest.
Multiple intelligence reports on the
whereabouts of the al-Qaeda leader are contained among the documents.
They disclose publicly for the first time that bin Laden is thought to
be personally overseeing the work of suicide bombers and the makers of
Taliban roadside bombs which have had a devastating effect on British
and US troops.
A secret threat report drafted by the Nato-led
International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) in 2006 locates bin Laden
as well as the Taliban leader Mullah Omar to the Pakistani city of
Quetta as well as several villages on the Afghan border.
UK Telegraph 27 July 2010.
The core-lies retained in the Wikileaks' disclosure - which I call 'the
Afghanistan Papers' - is to once again reaffirm that there is a real nemesis
called Osama Bin Laden, that the war on terror is real, that it is being
inflicted upon the West from Pakistan-Iran nexus, and to re-substantiate the
handoff of former President George W. Bush's clairvoyance to the Obama
Administration that,
If another September 11 style attack is being planned,
it probably is being plotted in Pakistan, and not Afghanistan!
That, when such a planned attack transpires,
it will make Sept. 11 pale by comparison.
See: Bin
Laden: Key enabler of imperial mobilization and nuclear attack on
Iran-Pakistan.
The successful handoff of imperial mobilization to Pakistan and Iran, now
further sprightly underscored by Wikileaks' documents, is once again
demonstrated by President Obama's Secretary of State Hilary Clinton's July
2010 remark to the BBC as quoted by Reuters:
There are still additional
steps that we are asking and expecting the Pakistanis to take. But there is no doubt in anyone's mind that
should an attack against the United States be traced to be Pakistani, it
would (have) a very devastating impact on our relationship.
And that is
merely just another echo from the Obama Administration of what the
Pakistanis themselves have been made to parrot the past 9 years, as
demonstrated by its own Ambassador's remark in 2008:
'[On] Wednesday, a media report quoted
Pakistans envoy to Washington as saying that US leaders had warned
Islamabad that if the United States suffered an attack that was traced
back to Pakistan Washington would retaliate. Those (statements) have
been made, Ambassador Hussain Haqqani told editors and reporters at The
Washington Post. We want to make sure that it doesnt come to that.'
DAWN, June 12, 2008
To show Pakistan's unflinching willingness to do
as much more as was asked, the Ambassador of Pakistan had further stated in
an interview to Reuters in 2008:
Egypt, Cairo June 4th 2009
Obama Warns not to challenge Official 9/11 Story
'I am aware that there is still some who would question, or
even justify the offense of 911.
But let us be clear. Al Qaeda killed nearly 3000 people on
that day. The victims were innocent men, women, and children
from America and many other nations who had done nothing to
harm anybody.
And yet Al Qaeda chose to ruthlessly murder these people,
claimed credit for the attack, and even now states their
determination to kill on a massive scale.
They have affiliates in many countries, to try to expand
their reach.
These are not opinions to be debated. These are facts to be
dealt with.'
President Obama, Cairo Egypt, June 4th
2009,
911 and Imperial Mobilization Redux By Zahir Ebrahim
'Pakistan would attack Osama bin Laden the
moment it had reliable intelligence on the Al Qaeda leader's
whereabouts, Ambassador Husain Haqqani said on Wednesday.
Haqqani also said he was confident Pakistan
could help foil any Al Qaeda plans to attack the United States, although
he did not know of any right now.
A cooperative effort between all the
allies, and that includes Afghanistan, Pakistan and the United
States and NATO - I think we can thwart any potential plans for an
attack, Haqqani said in an interview with Reuters.
He said Pakistani intelligence had helped
defeat many of the several dozen Al Qaeda plots detected worldwide
since the September 11, 2001, attacks, but government officials knew of
no immediate threats to the United States.
Haqqani said Pakistan would act on its own
against Al Qaeda if necessary.
If Pakistan, Afghanistan or the United
States had specific intelligence on the location of Osama bin Laden,
they would have acted on it. No reservations would have come in the
way of action on that, and none will even in the future, he said.
If any of us had that actionable intelligence we would all act. We
would act separately, we would act in tandem, we would act
cooperatively - we would act.'
DAWN, June 12, 2008
So, could these self-serving 'Afghanistan
Papers' have been any more convenient as a casus belli, carrying forth the
same core-lies now entering its tenth year?
If Wikileaks' dramatization grabbing all the
world's headlines isn't an officially sponsored modified limited hangout
for exactly that purpose of reinforcing the core-lies, then the White House
not even bothering to stop the New York Times - whose own motto is 'All the
news that's fit to print' - from publishing it, even giving it all got gold
stars as the Salon put it on July 26, 2010, is downright inexplicable:
So, uh ... why was all of this information
classified and top secret? If it's old news, and it just confirms what
"everyone" already knows, what was the rationale for keeping it
classified and calling WikiLeaks all sorts of mean names for publishing
it?
What would it matter afterwards, after Iran and
Pakistan have been bombed, what were lies and what was truth?
Did the bogus mea culpa by the 2005 Presidential
Commission on intelligence failure, the Iraq Study Group's disingenuous
conclusion:
We conclude that the intelligence community
was dead wrong in almost all of its prewar judgments about Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction. This was a major intelligence failure,
reverse the decimation of Iraq?
Did the New York Times 2008 revelation of
Pentagon's Message Machine after 'all the barbers in town already knew it',
return back to its silos each and every cruise missile that was dropped upon
the innocent civilians of Iraq?
ZERO
'In the summer of 2005, the
commission of the European parliament for security and
defense, of which I am a member, was invited to a special
screening created by the Washington Center for Strategic
Studies
We were asked to watch a film which depicted what would
happen in Europe, if Brussels was hit by a nuclear bomb.
Fifty thousand deaths, hundred thousand injured. The
reactions of various European governments.
Suddenly, footage
of Osama Bin Laden claiming responsibility for a nuclear
attack on NATO headquarters comes on screen. All members of
the parliament, myself included, were rendered speechless.
Then a parliamentarian finally said:
Today we were shown a convincing demonstration of how Osama
Bin Laden's image can be completely manipulated. All the
Osama's we have seen over the years, may never have existed.
Just as a nuclear attack on NATO Headquarters in Brussels
has never taken place.'
ZERO
That is the real import of the craftsmanship of the Mighty Wurlitzer!
To engineer a fait accompli by manufacturing
consent among the gullible masses and dissent among the rabble rousers,
leaving future scholars, historians, and the odd malcontent to laudingly
study the ashes left behind by history's actors.
A diabolical modus operandi of democratic
statecraft which the Mighty Wurlitzer's operators even brazenly brag about:
'We're an empire now, and when we act, we
create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality -
judiciously, as you will - we'll act again, creating other new
realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out.
We're history's actors... and you, all of you, will be left to just
study what we do.'
(Ron Suskind, New York Times, Oct. 17,
2004)
Those attempting to see through its fog of
deception when a fait accompli can still be averted - before missiles have
left their silos, before pen has been put to tortuous legalisms - are
variously labeled as 'kooks', 'conspiracy theorists', 'delusional',
'denier', etc., their efforts infiltrated (as in cointelpro) and energies
defocused by introducing what's cynically called beneficial cognitive
diversity. See
Anatomy of Conspiracy Theory.
There is an undeniable categorical imperative before the Western peoples
today.
With the escalating belligerence towards Iran
and the strategic dismantling of Pakistan palpably on the visible horizon,
will the profoundly innocent of knowledge in the West allow themselves to be
fooled once again into more criminal aggression upon civilian populations in
the name of 'War on Terror'
See:
Postscript War on Terror is not about Islamofascism.
Or, will the people choose to not be (willingly) deceived by the Mighty
Wurlitzer's many ruses at every level which continually justify the core
axioms of imperial mobilization by
way of deception?
Further Study
As this is mainly a self-study note - because satisfying one's curiosity by
a modicum of due diligence is the order of business rather than reading
synopsis and excerpts and believing 'experts' - the following suggested
minimal readings and videos are useful in comprehending the pernicious role
of intelligence assets which perpetually infiltrate the media and the
academe.
You will learn how society is manipulated in the
direction of its ruling-elite's agendas, how ordinary peoples serving in
positions of influence in the institutions of the ruling-elite involuntarily
succumb to freely promulgating the oligarchs' agendas, and most importantly,
why it is almost impossible for ordinary decent peoples, too busy pursuing
their 'American Dreams', to perceive this sophisticated manipulation which
goes on 24x7.

Zahir Ebrahim,
Prisoners of the Cave,
2003, Chapter 6: How does the US News Media end up towing
the line?
The Military-Industrial-Media
corporate complex with interlocked board memberships, and opaque
stock ownership by institutional investors the largest of which is
the U.S. Government (see Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports at
http://CAFR1.com), represent the same vested interests which
control the Policy Planning of the CIA and the Pentagon as the
Primacy Imperatives of the sole superpower, the United States of
America.
These interlocking for-profit
corporations and their majority stock-holders who profit from war,
primacy, and hegemony, also own and control the news media, news
distribution, the entertainment industry, and essentially all
outlets of exercising sophisticated Hegellian Dialectics of Mass
Deception upon a not too knowledgeable population.
With increasing consolidation of
information synthesis, packaging, and delivery into fewer and fewer
corporate hands owned and controlled by a handful of people, the
ideological alignment of their interests makes a sham of the much
touted 'fourth pillar of democracy'. Therefore, operationally
speaking, the government is almost trivially able to influence news
to manufacture consent for its primacy imperatives in the same way
that the oligarchs are able to select the government to implement
their agendas in an entirely bipartisan way.
Rather than the White House issue daily
directives to the editorial staff of major news organizations as in
any vanilla dictatorship, the editorial staff and the corporate
owners a priori know All the news that's fit to print.
With the right placement of assets and
stooges in the news organizations, the tactical synchronization of
worldwide propaganda is made superlatively effective - as the 'War
on Terror' against 'Militant Islam'. Also see
Chapter 4: The Role of
Mass Media in Empire Building.
-
Additionally, see the watered down
'non-conspiratorial' model of self-censorship to stay gainfully
employed, and the self-selection of like-minded blind-sighted
journalist-editorial-staff in any news organization as per the often
unstated overarching imperatives of the news organization in which
one automatically knows what flourishes and what doesn't, in Noam
Chomsky's
Manufacturing Consent, 1986.
Chomsky's treatise is applicable more to
the incestuous self-censorship of shallow but well-intentioned
mental-midgets - the bulwark of the newsmedia - rather than the
calculating mercenarial agendists and vulgar propagandists
selectively planted in key positions for psy-ops by the 'Mighty
Wurlitzer'.
More insidious than manufacturing
consent however, is manufacturing dissent, something which Noam
Chomsky has unfortunately written little about, leaving it to his
nondescript student to unravel in
Weapons of Mass Deception.
Witness the manufactured dissent in real
action wherein it retains the same core-axioms as manufactured
consent, in My beef with the stellar congressman Hon. Ron Paul

What permits all this manipulation and
deception to occur? It is the deliberate gaping-hole left in the
'fourth pillar of democracy' by the founders of the world's greatest
modern Republic on paper - a colossus in practice which has today
taken over the world with its systems, values, and McDonalds backed
by McDonnell Douglas ( http://tinyurl.com/mcwwuv ) whereby, the once
'hidden hand' of the market which went so hand-in-hand with its
'hidden fist' is now nakedly un-gloved - as explained in Prisoners

engineering of consent and its dialectical manufacturing of
dissent are part and parcel of the Mighty Wurlitzer's ordinary
persuasion toolkit.
More specialized psychological tools are
continually explored and refined in many think-places in the West
under the sanitized vernacular of Human Relations and Public
Relations, including presumably at the Tavistock Institute in
London.
Listen to Aldous Huxley's take on where
mind-behavior manipulation techniques are rapidly headed, wherein
people will simply end up loving their own servitude, titled The

-
Today, the Edward Bernays led
comprehension of mass psychology, and its sophisticated manipulation
as an essential instrument of state-craft (http://tinyurl.com/endless-mindfck) - the social engineering of consent - is empirical, and quite
diabolical. This is betrayed, for instance, not only in the 1996
book by Zbigniew Brzezinski titled The Grand Chessboard where he
noted his now famous maxim Democracy is inimical to imperial
mobilization, but also in the 1997-98 report by the so called
Terrorism Study Group which accurately predicted the chain
reaction of reaction-response cycle to Catastrophic Terrorism,
predicated upon the psychological axiom 'Public Assumptions' Shape
Views of History:
-
Such presumptions are beliefs (1)
thought to be true (although not necessarily known to be true
with certainty), and (2) shared in common within the relevant
political community. The sources for such presumptions are both
personal (from direct experience) and vicarious (from books,
movies, and myths).
The following passage from History
commons (http://tinyurl.com/mlzfns) lends prima facie evidence (http://tinyurl.com/6qhgfg) to how the Mighty Wurlitzer diabolically
harnessed the 'searing' or 'molding' event of 911, the new Pearl
Harbor, to successfully implant the public myths for the never
ending War on Terror (http://tinyurl.com/dmr8gr) deemed
necessary by political psychoanalysts for overcoming the democratic
instinctual aversion to imperial mobilization:
-
An act of catastrophic terrorism
that killed thousands or tens of thousands of people and/or
disrupted the necessities of life for hundreds of thousands, or
even millions, would be a watershed event in Americas history.
It could involve loss of life and
property unprecedented for peacetime and undermine Americans
fundamental sense of security within their own borders in a
manner akin to the 1949 Soviet atomic bomb test, or perhaps even
worse.
Constitutional liberties would be
challenged as the United States sought to protect itself from
further attacks by pressing against allowable limits in
surveillance of citizens, detention of suspects, and the use of
deadly force. More violence would follow, either as other
terrorists seek to imitate this great success or as the United
States strikes out at those considered responsible.
Like Pearl Harbor, such an event
would divide our past and future into a before and after.

Another immediately pertinent text-book
example of Edward Bernays' influence on social engineering with the
help of the Mighty Wurlitzer, is the psychological mantras and
existential pretexts created to rapidly bring the Ultimate

Metanoia-films.org has a 2-hour video
documentary titled 'Human Resources' for those more inclined to
watch than read. The amazing description of the website in its own
words entirely captures the essential purpose of Project
Humanbeingsfirst as well:
-
'The Greek term for repentance,
metanoia, denotes a change of mind, a reorientation, a
fundamental transformation of outlook, of an individual's vision
of the world and of her/himself... In the words of a
second-century text, The Shepherd of Hermas, it implies "great
understanding," discernment. In Carl Jung's psychology, metanoia
indicates a spontaneous attempt of the psyche to heal itself of
unbearable conflict by melting down and then being reborn in a
more adaptive form.'
I would add that in Islam, the actual
process to acquire that great understanding, that fundamental
transformation of outlook, that melting down and then being
reborn, is the severe path of jihad-un-nafs.
To overcome one's ingrained worldviews
and indoctrinations is never an easy journey even when one becomes
aware of the social and psychological forces which naturally
construct Plato's Prisoners of the Cave. Most will of course remain
unaware of it throughout their life, never mind wage a struggle to
overcome it, and will continually be manipulated into 'United We
Stand' with ruling agendas - a plight which has dogged mankind since
time immemorial.
A forensic exploration of breaking out
of this prison of the mind is in my trilogy on Israel-Palestine
which comprise the Pamphlet: How To Return to Palestine.

Finally, the question of reform
continually arises among the antagonists of the Mighty Wurlitzer,
the idealists, and the malcontents.
They would rather pretend that some
rational reform can do away with the Mighty Wurlitzer altogether.
The following response to the question raised by Robert Jensen,
Professor of Journalism, Can journalism schools be relevant in a
world on the brink?, September 15, 2009, injects a doze of
reality-check: Re-titling can perhaps make the problem-space more
apparent: Can journalism schools be relevant in a New World Order of
one-world government? (http://tinyurl.com/kpgkth).
Edward Bernays brilliant successes at
mass behavior manipulation has conclusively shown that masses are
typically not motivated into action by information, rather, by
appeal to their irrational sub-conscious mind, to their fears, and
that they remain quite susceptible under hidden emotional
manipulation.
It appears to this cynic, that unless
the much wonted fourth pillar of democracy, journalism - the
watchdog upon the corridors of power - adopts these same
manipulative tactics of the oligarchs in order to even begin to play
its theoretically assigned role in a theoretical constitutional
republic, it is destined to largely remain a tool of signaling and
communication among the elite themselves, and of the masses'
manipulation, regardless of any window dressing of reform!
To substantiate this egregious point,
see table 3 titled APPROXIMATE USE OF MEDIA in Zbigniew
Brzezinski's seminal book Between Two Ages - America's Role in the
Technetronic Era, page 14 (http://tinyurl.com/nqlxk5).
The readership data for the printed
press like the NYT, while quantitatively dated, is qualitatively
even more attuned to the hypnotic reality of television mass media
today where useful advance information can sometimes be gleaned in
the inside pages of the elite's own printed press - provided one has
learnt how to parse the elite's language - bur rarely if ever on
mass television.
Conclusion
When Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives to orchestrate a one-world
government is the ingrained doctrine among the 'ubermensch' and their
instruments, it is trivial to come up with any rationalism for even the most
atrocious barbarism inflicted upon the 'untermenschen'.
Convince the public of absurdities and one can
get them to acquiesce to any atrocity - from outright murderous invasion of
