"The Cabal" refers to a claque of global-scale plutocratic manipulators who use their immense wealth, prestige and power to control governments and economies to perpetuate their stranglehold on global society.
This group is comprised of the most selfish, megalomaniacal, and sociopathic individuals, some of whom are bigshots in,
the Bilderberg Group the Council on Foreign Relations the Trilateral Commission,
the Bilderberg Group
the Council on Foreign Relations
the Trilateral Commission,
...global policy-making groups.
But these groups are not synonymous with The Cabal, since BC, CFR and TLC also contain some well-intentioned individuals. The Cabal is a kind of "parallel government" to the official elected and appointed governments of the more developed countries.
In the Cabal five branches may be identified.
These branches are:
the Executive Branch the Intelligence Branch the War Department the Weapons Industry Branch the Financial Department
the Executive Branch
the Intelligence Branch
the War Department
the Weapons Industry Branch
the Financial Department
An analysis of the overall purposes of these five branches suggests that the overall purpose of the Cabal is to exercise covert control by:
collecting comprehensive institutional and personal information by establishing national and international policy independently of the established Governments by developing high-tech arms and equipment, and, with these, establishing small, specialized, highly-mobile, elite military units to effect these covert policies, when need arises, without having to rely on the official (and "unreliable") Armed Services, (whose subservience to the Cabal is reasonably suspect) by developing an armed capability to repel any threat to the status quo, (including the uncertain ontological, social, and economic impacts of any revelation of the reality of UFO and extraterrestrial presence) through the development of a Star Wars/BMDO ground and space-based surveillance and SDI weapons network by denying information compromising to the Cabal from all those outside "need-to-know" policymaking levels by exercising control on the money supply, availability of credit, and the worth of money, through policy decisions made outside of the official Governments

The Cabal are also the rogue group behind the continuation of the unauthorized UFO Cover-Up.
Unfortunately, The Cabal has its proxies on some of the seats in the Special Studies Group of the U.S. National Security Council, which controls official-government UFO information and access.
Since the Cabal has enormous international wealth at its disposal, it has the funds and influence to make sure that the majority of presentations which make it to public view are negativistic in tone.
Their thinking is that if they can't sell you the lie that "UFOs don't exist", then their fall-back strategy is to convince you that "they are evil mean invaders." Thus, the presentations they finance and promote feature the Star Visitors as torturers, plotters and monsters.
The unauthorized UFO Cover-Up is to be distinguished from the official-government UFO Cover-Up.
The unauthorized UFO Cover-Up is the organization that conducts kidnappings and terrorizing of innocent civilians, camouflaged as "alien abductions". They do wholesale "cattle mutilations", hoping that angry ranchers and terrorized citizens will blame it on "the aliens".
It should also be noted that some of the lurid reports being palmed off on the public as examples of alien misbehavior are actually secret psychological warfare operations by human rogue military-intelligence units.
These renegade military-intelligence units kidnap civilians without legal authorization or justification. These units drug those they kidnap, (often experiencers).
These renegades deliberately intimidate, interrogate, physically abuse, and even gang-rape the civilians they kidnap.
The renegade military-intelligence units then use brainwashing techniques to make the civilians they kidnap forget about the military kidnapping, while the renegades narco-hypnotically implant a false memory about the horrific experience as an "alien abduction".
This is the level of evil, distortion and treachery that the Cabal repressing UFO truth goes to to protect their monopoly of highly-advanced extraterrestrial technology recovered from UFO crashes: a monopoly which has brought them trillions of dollars in profits over the last four-plus decades.
The Cabal's operatives also terrorize some UFO researchers who get too close, and even assassinate a few. They hijack some psychotronic weaponry for unauthorized use on their enemies or on innocent civilian guinea pig test subjects.
In general, most of the horrific stuff done under the UFO Cover-Up comes from
The Cabal's unauthorized version of the UFO Cover-Up, often using their plants within military and intelligence organizations to further camouflage who is at work.
The Cabal has been around for many millennia in its various incarnations as dark-side shamanic practitioners, priestcraft organizations, and secret societies, whose inner initiates use dark psychic arts for power, such as psychic projection, conjured hallucinations, and dream-insertions, etc. to intimidate and influence targeted individuals.
The human-like reptoid imagery they use sometimes has been a favorite over the millennia, as these dark-arts "magicians" shrewdly capitalize on a widespread natural abhorrence of reptiles. Huge amounts of disinformation are being pumped out about Star Visitors, and to confuse things further, the Cabal make up or distort ancient legends and traditions about "fearsome creatures", to create the illusion that, for example, such fake "resident evil reptilians" have been going on for centuries. The Cabal have increased their power by consciously choosing to reincarnate into an Ego-focused new lifetime/persona, time and time again in successive lifetimes, continuing to associate with other dark-arts practitioners in groups who abuse their psi powers to manipulate, control, and gain more power.
As they have grown in power with each successive generation, their abilities far outstrip most persons with incidental and occasional psychic ability. Further, the Cabal have over the centuries "eliminated the competition" by identifying psychically-gifted individuals (through social-network snitches, or by remote-sensing such good psychics), and then branding them as witches, warlocks, voodoo doctors, heretics, "devil-worshipers", demons-in-disguise, etc., so that either the Cabal-controlled governments or a panicked citizenry will imprison or execute them. Thus, the path is cleared for the Cabal dark wizards to be the only ones left to operate as they please. Of course, they do all this from the shadows, continuing to foster the illusion that a group such as the Cabal "don't really exist", and that anyone saying the contrary is a "conspiracy nut". Books like Jim Marrs's Rule By Secrecy, or Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier's Morning of the Magicians trace back the intertwined history of magic, secret societies and power for varying lengths of time.
But understanding how the Cabal have been operating is key to arriving at a revisionist and accurate understanding and true history of how things got to be this bad, (and is also a key to breaking their power.) We are fortunate that Star Nations has agreed to aid our efforts to eradicate this evil from our society.
(By the way, there is also an official-government-authorized UFO Denial Program which is comparatively less ruthless, yet is still morally responsible for the global suffering that could have been averted if the general public had access to clean non-petroleum energy, psychotronic healing machines, Zero Point Energy-powered hydroponic food-growing machines, gravity-shielded superfast airliners and sea freighters, and the immense store of spiritual, metaphysical and scientific knowledge that the Star Visitors wish to share with the people of Earth.)
Some remote viewers have seen The Cabal's power broken between 2003 and 2006.
They definitely will be left in the trash bin of history, by the time the transition from Fourth World [current societal mess] to Fifth World [cosmic, just, non-materialistic, peaceable, extended-family society] is well established by 2012.
