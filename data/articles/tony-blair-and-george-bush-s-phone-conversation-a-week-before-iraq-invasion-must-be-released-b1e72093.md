Words that Tony Blair spoke over the phone to
George Bush on the eve of the Iraq war are to be made public,
a tribunal ordered today.
The Foreign Office has been ordered to release parts of the note detailing
the conversation on 12 March 2003, a week before the invasion of Iraq began.
A panel chaired by tribunal judge Professor John Angel overruled
objections from the Foreign Office that publishing any part of the
conversation could do serious damage to relations with the USA
They said in their ruling:
The circumstances surrounding a decision by
a UK government to go to war with another country is always likely to be
of very significant public interest, even more so with the consequences
of this war.
The two leaders are believed to have discussed
whether they should go to
the United Nations for a resolution
specifically authorizing them to go to war.
British and US diplomats had worked frantically to try to win over a
majority of members of the Security Council. Then on 10 March, Frances
President Jacques Chirac told French TV that even if there was a
majority, France would vote no, thus vetoing the resolution.
It was likely that Russia would also wield a
veto.
It was after hearing President Chiracs remarks that Tony Blair finally gave
up the quest for a second UN resolution, a decision he is assumed to have
conveyed to President Bush in that 12 March phone call.
Jack Straw, who was Foreign Secretary at the time of the Iraq war
told the subsequent
Chilcot Inquiry:
"This was the great Chiracian pronouncement.
Whatever the circumstances, he says, La France will veto."
Documents released by the inquiry into the war
show that the French repeatedly protested at the interpretation which
Britain put on Chiracs words, but their objections were ignored.
Sir John Holmes, who was Britain's Ambassador to France at the time,
told the inquiry that there was ambiguity in the Presidents remarks.
The tribunal ordered that an edited version of the note should be released
within 30 days.
An
FCO spokesman said:
The FCO is obviously disappointed by the
decision of the tribunal. We will want to study the terms of the
judgment more closely over the coming days.
