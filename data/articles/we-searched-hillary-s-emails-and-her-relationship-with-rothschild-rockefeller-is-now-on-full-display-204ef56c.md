# We Searched Hillary's Emails and her Relationship with 
Rothschild/Rockefeller is Now on Full Display

Hillary Clinton
has been deemed a sure bet for the White House, as it's
widely speculated the inflammatory
Donald Trump
and socialist-leaning
Bernie Sanders
stray too far from establishment politics to be truly electable.
But
it wasn't until an examination using
Wikileaks searchable archive of
Clinton's emails that the
establishment's love of
the Democratic war-hawk became truly
apparent.
Buried in thousands of the former Secretary of State's emails
sent via her personal server, are intimations of her close
relationship with the infamous
Rothschild banking family and
hints for a potential
Rockefeller-State partnership.
Lynn Forester de Rothschild
wrote an
email
on April 18, 2010, in which she tells Hillary she would,
"love to catch up" -
and
"I remain your loyal
adoring pal."
Clinton responds,
"let's make that happen," and signs her
response, "Much love, H."
On September 23, 2010, Clinton
emailed
Lynn Forester de Rothschild (an email chain marked by heavy
redaction) saying,
"I was trying to reach you to tell you and
Teddy that I asked Tony Blair to go to Israel as part of our
full court press on keeping the Middle East negotiations
going
"
Rothschild responds, thanking Clinton for,
"personally reaching out to us," and
adds, "You are the best,
and we remain your biggest fans."
A January 9, 2012,
email
discusses a conference on the environment set to take place at
Jacob Rothschild's "historic estate,
Waddesdon."
On New Year's Eve 2012, Lynn Forester de
Rothschild sent an
email
to Clinton "praying for" her speedy recovery.
"And, my email box is lighting up with
all the PUMA's and their 18M prayers for Hillary campaign,"
states the email, which is signed,
"Love, Lynn, Evelyn, Ben and Jake."
An
email
to Clinton, dated October 15, 2009, from
Melanne Verveer -
former director of Pres. Obama's State Department office for
Global Women's Issues and longtime Clinton family insider -
states:
"Speaking at UNESCO Monday with
the new director on the unfinished Beijing agenda [REDACTED]
called to say she wants to give us several million dollars
to subsidize a fund to give an annual award for innovation
in empowering women that would be a rockefeller-State [sic]
partnership."
Then, on March 10, 2012, Verveer
hints
at least at a possible locale for Hillary's future endeavors:
"I forgot to tell you that
Judith Rodin offered you a suite of offices after you leave
State for your own use at Rockefeller Fdtn, if you're
interested - with no strings attached.
She also said they'd
be happy to provide you with a month at their center in
Bellagio if you just want to read and write in a beautiful
place."
Though none of the emails The
Free Thought Project examined appeared overtly damning -
thanks, in part, to sometimes heavy redaction - the evidence of
Clinton's comfort with the establishment lends credence to
theories of her being the 'chosen' candidate.
Numerous emails evidence Hillary's staff
carefully monitoring - and even manipulating -
mainstream news
outlets as well.
Lynn F. de Rothschild
told
Hillary in August 2009 about a fluff piece journalist
Les Gelb
was eager to pen for Parade Magazine. Other emails
show
an almost paranoid eye Clinton kept trained on the
Tea Party and
its journalists and mouthpieces.
To
reiterate, nothing particularly damning in itself was found in
this admittedly cursory search - but the relationships these
emails document, alone, evidence Hillary's concrete
establishment roots.
While Trump infuriates the GOP and Sanders'
popular support lacks translation into delegate votes, perhaps
these documents support the popular theory Hillary Clinton will
be the next president - no matter what...
Wikileaks Exposes Hillary Clinton
...with
Gigantic Release of Private Emails and Accuses Facebook for
Censoring It
by Arjun Walia

from
Collective-Evolution Website
Not long ago,
Hillary Clinton was outed
for hypocrisy and corruption when 3,000 emails were released
from her private email server in late December of 2015.
The emails detailed how a violent
intervention was not really necessary
in Libya, and that the invasion
was less about protecting the people from a dictator than it was
about money, banking, oil, and preventing African economic
sovereignty.
Now Clinton has come under fire
again, this time for emails she sent while serving as Secretary
of State.
If you haven't already heard (no
mainstream media outlets seem to be acknowledging this),
Wikileaks released a searchable
archive of 30,322 emails pulled from a private account she was
using during this time. The messages have been made easily
available and in a
searchable format.
A few days after this, Wikileaks
accused the social media giant
Facebook of deliberately
censoring and blocking access to the post.
Here's what the
Anti-Media had to say
about the release:
The scary, albeit fascinating
expos√© on who's in bed with whom in the halls of global
power has expanded to include Facebook, according to
WikiLeaks.
The organization has accused the
social networking site of censorship, saying Facebook is
blocking users' access to the latest Clinton dispatch.
The Problem With
Politics That Nobody Ever Talks About
Countless politicians and presidents
have told the world, over and over again, that a 'hidden hand'
or 'invisible' government is really in charge, and that this
'shadow'
government is free from the law itself, doing
whatever it wants while amassing enormous amounts of
power and perpetuating the military industrial complex.
This unidentified conglomerate
controls the entire political process - not heads of state -
which is probably why President Rosevelt told us that presidents
are selected, not elected.
Below is a statement from Senator
William Jenner, given to Congress in 1954:
Today the path to total dictatorship in the
U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means, unseen and unheard
by Congress, the President, or the people...
We have a well-organized political-action
group in this country, determined to destroy our
Constitution and establish a one-party state. It operates
secretly, silently, continuously to transform our
Government... [and] this ruthless power-seeking elite is a
disease of our century.
This group is answerable neither to the
President, the Congress, nor the courts. It is practically
irremovable.

Bernie Sanders recently made
this point as well, revealing to the American people, in no
uncertain terms, how little power presidents truly have:
No matter who is elected to be president,
that person will not be able to address the enormous
problems facing the working families of our own country.
They will not be able to succeed because the power of
corporate America, the power of Wall Street, the power of
campaign donors is so great that no president alone can
stand up to them.
(source)
Unfortunately, the common theory
that Democrats and Republicans are merely two wings of the same
bird, sharing the same flight path, seems to be holding true.
If there is one major problem
with this entire political process, it's that it gives us the
illusion of democracy.
Think about it:
-
Does voting really make any
difference whatsoever?
-
With the entire American
political system lying in the hands of a small group of
people and the corporations they run, all held together
by the big banks, what good does electing a president
who has absolutely no power do?
Even if they do have influence, most
are bought and paid for by their sponsors, and many engage in
activities that are concealed from public knowledge; these
Hillary emails are a great example of that.
We live in a world of secrecy, one
in which transparency efforts like those of
Julian Assange and
Edward Snowden are
condemned.
What kind of a democracy is this?
The fact is that truth threatens the entire system of control,
it threatens the interests of the global elite, and it threatens
their ability to keep us quiet.
Politics has become a world of
secrecy, one in which few citizens have any real idea of what is
actually transpiring.
An increased need for national
security has provided the justification for such secrets, and as
President Kennedy warned us, this constant, heightened
need for security has been seized upon by those who continue to
abuse the power it affords them.
Dwight Eisenhower also warned
us about the massive potential for misplaced power within the
military industrial complex.
Again, politicians may be able to
influence certain pieces of legislature here and there, but
ultimately, corporations hold so much power over governmental
policy that major legislature is rarely passed through an
actually democratic process. Even if it does, it generally
favors the big corporations.
The Trans Pacific Partnership (TTP)
is a great example of this. Every single year we experience the
same thing - we hear the same promises, we are pounded with
false hope, and we then put our desire for change in the hands
of others.
Electing a president these days is
usually a pretty empty gesture.
Behind
the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible
government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no
responsibility to the people.
President Roosevelt
