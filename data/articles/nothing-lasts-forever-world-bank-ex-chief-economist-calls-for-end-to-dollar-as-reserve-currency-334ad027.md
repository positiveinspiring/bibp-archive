In the past we have discussed at length the
inevitable demise of the USD as the world's reserve currency noting that
nothing lasts forever.
However, when former World Bank chief economist
Justin Yifu Lin warns that,
"the
dominance of the greenback is the root cause of global financial and
economic crises,"
...we suspect the world will begin to listen
(especially the Chinese. Lin, now - notably - an adviser to the Chinese
government, concludes that internationalizing the Chinese currency is not
the answer (preferring a basket approach) but ominously concludes,
"the solution to this is to
replace the national currency with a
global currency," as it will create more stable global financial system.
The infamous chart that shows nothing lasts
forever... Nothing lasts forever... (especially
in light of China's earlier comments)
Via China Daily.
The World Bank's
former chief economist wants to replace the US dollar with a single global
super-currency, saying it will create a more stable global financial system.
"The
dominance of the greenback is the root cause of global financial and
economic crises," Justin Yifu Lin told Bruegel, a Brussels-based
policy-research think tank.
"The solution to this is to replace the
national currency with a global currency."
Lin, now a professor at Peking University and a
leading adviser to the Chinese government, said expanding the basket of
major reserve currencies - the dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and pound
sterling - will not address the consequences of a financial crisis.
Internationalizing the Chinese currency is not
the answer, either, he said.
"China can
only play a supporting role in realizing the plans," Lin said.
"The urgent thing is for the US and Europe
to endorse these plans. And I think the G20 is an ideal platform to
discuss the ideas," he said, referring to the group of finance ministers
and central bank governors from 20 major economies.
The concept of
a global "super currency" tied to a basket of currencies has been
periodically discussed by world leaders as well as endorsed by 2001 Nobel
Memorial Prize-winner Joseph Stiglitz.
A super currency could also be tied to a single
currency, but the interconnectedness of world financial markets and concerns
about the volatility that can occur as a result of the system being tied to
one currency have made this idea less popular.
Arguments in favor of a global currency
resurfaced during October's US budget impasse, which forced the government
to shut down
(as we noted here).
"It is
perhaps a good time for the befuddled world to start considering
building a de-Americanized world," a Xinhua News Agency
commentary said on Oct 14.
The piece argued that creating a new
international reserve currency to replace reliance on the greenback, would
prevent government gridlock in Washington from affecting the rest of the
world.
In March 2009, China's central bank governor,
Zhou Xiaochuan, called for the creation of a new "super-sovereign reserve
currency" to replace the dollar.
In a paper published on the
People's Bank of China's website, Zhou said an international reserve
currency "disconnected from individual nations" and "able to remain stable
in the long run" would benefit the global
financial system more than current reliance on the dollar.
Of course, as we are seeing now, it's not just
the Chinese that are concerned...
On that note, David Bloom, global head of
FX research at HSBC, said US monetary
policy change,
"will bring
fluctuations for emerging countries' currencies and lead to financial
instability".
Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China
Center for International Economic Exchanges, a government think-tank, said,
"A
supranational currency may be a new direction for development of the
global financial system. It also requires different countries
to cooperate in coordinating macroeconomic policies."
Bloom and Chen both said
China needs to play a more important role
in global financial governance.
But Bloom said it is difficult for international
financial organizations to reach a consistent conclusion on how to improve
the foreign exchange system. He said the renminbi is predicted to be
stronger this year, even against an appreciating US dollar, and
internationalization of China's currency
will accelerate when the government decides to further open the capital
market.
Of course implementation will be painful...
Pierre Defraigne, executive director of the
Madariaga College of Europe Foundation in Brussels, said of Lin's
infrastructure proposal,
"It is excellent, but
the problem is how to implement these
plans to link those countries that need such infrastructural
construction and those with enough foreign reserves, by using an
effective global mechanism."
As we noted previously, the muddle-through is
over and there is no painless solution left...
Michal Krol, a researcher at the Brussels-based
European Center for International Political Economy, said,
"I don't
think that the largest economies and their currencies are at this moment
ready for the introduction of a supranational currency," Krol
said.
"Neither the EU nor China have financial
markets and monetary systems yet that are sound, solid, predictable and
well functioning to be the cornerstone for a global system.
But, indeed, it is time to formulate
the fundamentals for global monetary governance."
