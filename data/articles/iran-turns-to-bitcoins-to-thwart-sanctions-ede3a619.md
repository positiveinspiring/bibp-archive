Dollar-Less Iranians Discover...
Virtual Currency
Under sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies, dollars are hard to come
by in Iran.
The Rial fell from 20,160 against the greenback
on the street market in August to 36,500 Rials to the dollar in October.
Its settled, for now, around 27,000. The central banks fixed official rate
is 12,260.
Yet theres one currency in Iran that has kept
its value and can be used to purchase goods from abroad:
Bitcoins, the online-only currency.
Created in 2009 by a mysterious programmer named
Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoins behave a lot like any currency.
Their value is determined by demand, and they
can be used to buy stuff.
Bitcoin transactions are encrypted and handled by
a decentralized global network of tens of thousands of personal computers.
Merchants around the world accept the currency, from a bakery in San
Francisco to a dentist in Finland.
Individuals who own Bitcoins and wish to
exchange them for physical currencies like Euros or dollars can use exchange
sites such as
localbitcoins.com, a Finland-based site
founded by Jeremias Kangas.
I believe that Bitcoin is, or will be in
the future, a very effective tool for individuals who want to avoid
sanctions, currency restrictions, and high inflation in countries such
as Iran, Kangas wrote in an e-mail.
The advantage for Iranians is that Bitcoins can
be swapped for dollars that can then be kept outside the country.
Another plus: Regulators cant easily track the
transactions, since Bitcoins arent issued from a central server. Bitcoin
users can conduct business on virtual private networks, which hide
customers identities.
At online store
coinDL.com, shoppers can use Bitcoins to
buy Beyond Matter, the latest album from Iranian artist Mohammad Rafigh.
Anyone in the U.S. downloading songs, which fetch .039 Bitcoins or 45Â¢ each,
risks violating U.S. sanctions.
That doesnt bother Rafigh, whos studying
computer engineering as well as playing music.
Bitcoin is so interesting for me, Rafigh
wrote in an e-mail. I wish the culture of using digital money spreads
all over the world, because it does not have any dependency on anything
like politics.
Rafigh has translated some Bitcoin software into
Farsi for his friends.
I love Iran, and if Bitcoin is good for me,
it can be good for more Iranians like me.
Iranian-American Bitcoin consultant Farzad
Hashemi recently traveled to Tehran and talked up Bitcoin to his
friends.
They are instantly fascinated by it, he
says. Its a flash for them when they realize how it can solve their
problems.
Iranians working or living abroad can send
Bitcoins to their families, who can use one of the online currency
matchmaking services to find someone willing to exchange Bitcoins for Euros,
Rials, or dollars.
Bitcoins are useful to Iranians wishing to move
their money abroad, either to children studying in Europe or America or
simply to stash cash in a safe place.
As the value of the Rial plunges, many Iranians are trying to acquire
foreign currencies.
We have no idea what will happen, says
Amir-Hossein Madani, who says hes traded tens of millions of street
market dollars in Tehran over the past two years. These days prices
change every 10 minutes.
The uncertainty has led some Iranian software
developers to ask clients to pay them in Bitcoins.
Anyone with a computer is able to own,
send, and receive them. You can be at an Internet cafe in Iran and
managing a Bitcoin account, says Jon Matonis, a founding board member
of the Bitcoin Foundation, a Seattle nonprofit that promotes the
currency.
The exchange rate in Iran is 332,910 Rials per
Bitcoin. It isnt known how many Iranians use Bitcoins to skirt sanctions.
According to local-bitcoins Kangas, 32 people in Iran have contacted each
other through his site.
An internal FBI report in April expressed concern over the online currency.
The report was
leaked to Wired and Betabeat.
Since Bitcoin does not have a centralized
authority, law enforcement faces difficulties detecting suspicious
activity, identifying users, and obtaining transaction records -
problems that might attract malicious actors to Bitcoin, says the
report.
For now, Iranians are using Bitcoins to maintain
a fragile connection to the outside world.
The bottom line:
Iranians are resorting to virtual currency
to move money into and out of the country in a way that Western
authorities find hard to detect.
