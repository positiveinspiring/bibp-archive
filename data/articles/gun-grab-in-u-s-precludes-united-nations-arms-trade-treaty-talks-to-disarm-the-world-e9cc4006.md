Disarm the World

While the mainstream media condemns Wayne LaPierre, lobbyist for the
National Rifle Association (NRA) for
commenting that having armed police officers stationed at schools across
the country would curb gun-related crimes committed on campuses because,
the
only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,
...the Sidewell Friends School, where President Obamas two daughter attend, have
11 security officers and is seeking to
hire armed police officers to patrol the campus.
Since the
Sandy Hook shooting, gun sales have
sky-rocketed as Americans are rightly convinced that the Obama
administration is going to pass legislation banning semi-automatic guns and
high-capacity magazines, thereby rendering US citizens unable to defend
themselves from this tyrannical government.
Intimidation tactics used in up-state New York
by mainstream media are impeding on the privacy of registered gun owners to
coerce them into following suit with the national debate against the 2nd
Amendment.
The names and address of all gun permit holders were
published along with maps in an effort to demonize registered gun
owners.
The excuse for such a blatant disregard for
individual privacy was explained as giving lawmakers the necessity to,
expand the amount of information the public can find out about gun owners.
Unlike sex offenders, gun owners are not obligated to alert their
neighborhood of their presence.
Some special interest groups would like to
change that.
Mainstream distraction from the schemes of the
current administration with regard to gun control are
evidenced in the tit-for-tat battle over whether or not David Gregory,
host of Meet The Press violated Washington DC regulations by presenting a
high-capacity magazine on a recent episode of the show.
Other distractions
include a
rumor turned epic search on the internet for a supposed connection
between Peter Lanza and the US Senate LIBOR Hearings.
No such connection is
factually based. In fact this lie, perpetrated by many alternative media
sites was invented by a known disinfo agent and an anonymous person on a
website attributed to Anonymous.
Senators Chuck Schumer and Lindsey Graham spoke
with Gregory about gun-control, affirming that assault weapons bans do not
work.
Since the number of concealed weapons permits has risen since the 1994
assault weapons ban ended in 2004, the proof of less gun-related violence
would logically be attributed to more law-abiding citizens legally allowed
to carry their weapons in public under concealment is a clear determent from
criminals enacting violence against them.
The University of Pennsylvania
study of
the Clinton assault weapons ban concluded that the legislation had no
effect on the naturally occurring decrease in gun-related violence because
the ban only exempt gun and magazines that were manufactured prior to 1994.
The statistical fact that mass shootings are so rare makes them impossible
to attribute to the availability of guns to the American public.
To confuse the push by Obama on gun-control, he
and Attorney General
Eric Holder (below image) are teaming up to recommend that immigrants
to America retain the ability to purchase guns while natural born US
citizens fight to keep their 2nd Amendment intact.
Earlier this year, Holder
proposed to throw out the 90 day residency requirement rule because,
This rule would finalize the interim final rule published on June 7, 2012
by removing the 90-day State residency requirement for aliens lawfully
present in the United States to purchase or acquire a firearm.
The
Department has determined that the Gun Control Act does not permit ATF to
impose a regulatory requirement that aliens lawfully present in the United
States are subject to a 90-day State residency requirement when such a
requirement is not applicable to U.S. citizens.
The move would allow immigrants to more easily
purchase guns and in April 2013 it is slated for passage or failure on
Capitol Hill.
Buy-back programs are sweeping the nation as an alternative to legislation
banning guns. Considering if Americans will simply hand over their
2nd
Amendment under guise of creating gun-free zones, then all will be safer for
it; however nothing can be further from the truth.
Spear-headed by Nancy Pelosi, House Minority
Leader and John Boehner, Speaker of the House, was a letter supported by 40
other members of Congress
demanding a national gun buy-back program because they,
have proven
successful in communities across the nation.
And for the purpose of
disarming Americans, yes it is successful.
This comes on the heels of Senator Diane
Feinsteins
proposal that there be a federal program funding national gun buy-backs.
And New York Governor Andrew Cuomo
recommended confiscation of guns as an option as well as forcing
Americans to sell their guns to the state to remove them from average
citizens.
Having a gun is illegal in New York City. This would stretch this
attack on the 2nd Amendment across the nation should New York City become
the new national model.
In March of 2013, the UN General Assembly will
reconvene for talks to reach an agreement in the Arms Trade Treaty.
A
draft treaty under consideration would
demand America conforms to international regulations on guns by:
-
Enact international licensing requirements for
Americans
-
Confiscate and destroy unauthorized firearms of Americans
-
Allow governments to retain access to assault weapons
-
Ban trade, sale and private ownership of semi-automatic guns
-
Create and mandate international registry to organize gun confiscation
The mainstream media is propagandizing to the
general public with disinformation and talking points and scourge those
celebrities that are not jumping on the bandwagon.
While the sheeple of
America simply agree with every assertion without evidence suggested by the
talking heads on daytime talk shows, certain members our collective refuse
to allow the violence of few to affect the lives of us all.
Here is a great
example of this:
