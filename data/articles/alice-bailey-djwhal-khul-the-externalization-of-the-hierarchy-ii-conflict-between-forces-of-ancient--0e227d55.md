# Alice Bailey & Djwhal Khul - The Externalization of the Hierarchy - II -
Conflict between Forces of Ancient Origin

Seed groups are in process of being "esoterically
anchored" in the field of the world, having in them those who can respond to the
subtler forces and who can - through the strength of their clear thought at this stage of
the proceedings - produce those conditions (within the present existing world trends and
world groups) which will enable the new sciences, the new approaches to divinity, the new
education, and the new modes of handling the economic situation and the political
problems, to precipitate and further the growth of the Kingdom of God in such a manner
that this fifth kingdom in nature may be a tangible, factual and objective occurrence upon
the Earth.In the founding of the fourth kingdom in nature, the human kingdom, the
process is spoken of in the ancient books and archives in the library of the Hierarchy in
the following terms which are (some of them) paraphrased and expanded in The Secret
Doctrine:
"Seven men appeared, the prisoners of the Prajapatis and the prisoners also of the
earthly Barhishads...Seven men of seven colors...Seven men, each on his own lot and
related to the eighth. They spoke and knew each other. They saw and they desired that
which then appeared. They sensed the first, the second and the third. They were themselves
the fourth, but of the fifth they had as yet no knowledge for they were prisoners of the
world and the fifth could not appear. The fires which were forty-nine in number proceeded
then to do their work, and the prison bars grew firm as steel...But time persisted and the
seven - each on his own lot - began to grow too large for the confining bars."
This parable will be apparent to esotericists. The clue to what I have to say comes
later in the same ancient writing, and here I will roughly paraphrase or freely translate
it for you.
"The seven - each on his own lot - acquired knowledge. The knowledge was the same,
but the soil within [91] the lots differed. Nevertheless, the goal of reaching towards the
heavens was the same as in the second (a reference to the vegetable kingdom and its
symbolically skyward aspiration)...No further do they reach. Upon the lot of each, nine
points of light appear, reflected in the heavens; they brought to seeding point that human
seed which has within it that which is not of man. The light produced the germination and
thus the new and better forms of life. And yet the form remains and yet its quality is
changed. (I can find no better word than 'quality' wherewith to translate the ancient
symbol). Some things are lost and disappear and rightly so. Some newer modes of life and
what life builds appear, and thus the fifth is seen on earth like to the second and
nurtured by the fourth. Within it are the one, the two, the three and then the fifth. And
thus the glory of the One is seen."
One meaning is obvious if you study with care the implications and relate it to the
kingdoms of nature. There are of course several meanings to these ancient writings.
I have referred above to the five streams of energy and have related them to the five
centers. Let me extend the idea somewhat by pointing out that these five energies are
related to the centers or the lotuses to which I referred in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire,
or to the dynamic point within the lotus, through which the central life of the lotus
flows; in the case of the first three energies (of Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity)
you have the permanent point of life, light and activity in the lotus; in the case of that
potent energy connected with the Jews, you have a very temporary inflow of energy, and in
the case of the Forces of Materialism, you have a relatively temporary - though apparently
permanent - focal point of reactionary energy.
