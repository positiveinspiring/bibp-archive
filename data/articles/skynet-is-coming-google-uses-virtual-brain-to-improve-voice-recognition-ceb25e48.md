Google is ready to make put its artificial
intelligence platform, its "virtual brain"
technology, to better use soon.
The technology has already taught itself to
recognize human faces and cat faces, and is now gearing up to take on the
difficult task of speech recognition and more. Google's "virtual brain" gets
its name because it is based on the idea of a neural network in the human
brain.
In that respect, it each piece of the "virtual
brain" can interact and influence each other in order to build a
self-teaching system.
The tech has already been put to work "watching" thousands of YouTube
videos, and from those videos it has been able to build the ideal
"average patterns" that are used to detect human faces and cat faces in
photos in Picasa and Google+ (the examples of which are found below).
Who said those cat videos were worthless?
The technology has also started getting
folded into other Google products.
Apparently, the tech has been put into the
speech recognition system in Android, and according to Vincent Vanhoucke,
one of the heads of Google's speech recognition system, the technology
has already improved the accuracy of speech recognition by 20-25%.
Android 4+ users may have noticed the tech
at work with the
real time dictation feature.
Any time you see a word pop up then correct
itself based on context, that's the Google brain at work. The neural
network is only working in US English right now, but should move to
different languages eventually.
The technology is likely going to be pushed
into the self-driving car soon enough, and has potential to make
searching by image better and much more. Essentially, the neural network
could make all Google products better in one way or another, because the
technology excels at learning context and adjusting for behavior.
This means that if you use voice actions to
search for "Oklahoma City Thunder", but the last word is garbled, the
system will check with
your pooled Google data and understand that you likely said
"Thunder" because of search history, etc. From the sound of it, this
technology either already is, or will soon be a huge part of the
intelligent push system that makes Google Now such an interesting
platform.
This technology appears to be the magic
sauce that allows Google to find some amazing links in context from the
huge amounts of data the company has on its users' habits, searches,
interests, and location.
And, that's the most amazing part of this technology:
the more data it is given, the more
context it can find, and the better it can learn to find more
relevant information and context.
Using pattern recognition and sound
recognition, the neural network could get closer to understanding
context and information surrounding a central target, like scanning the
background of an image to learn where a photo was taken by using
existing similar images and geotag data.
Of course, Google is quick to point out that
this is really still just the first step towards a true artificial
intelligence.
Although Google's neural network technology is smaller than a human
brain, can beat humans at certain tasks, and can teach itself and get
more efficient at learning, it still can't reason, which is essential
for intelligence.
So, the neural network can find specific
visual data faster than humans can, and it can match shapes and
patterns, and ultimately do jobs that would be incredibly tedious and
boring for humans. But, it can't draw from the outside world and reason
out the why or how of a thing.
Why and how are the most powerful of all questions, and both the asking
and drive to answer those questions are the true mark of intelligence.
Google's brain can't do that yet.
But, the question still stands: when the day
does come that Google or some other company creates a true artificial
intelligence, will you be there with pitchforks and torches, or with an
offering of peace for our new Cylon overlords?
