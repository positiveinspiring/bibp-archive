TYRANT AND TRAPEZITAE
Of the tyrants of Greece and Asia Minor in ancient times, the learned
Professor Heichelheim wrote: (1)
These tyrants were for the most part members of the nobility themselves
who had made the grade using the new political and economic possibilities of
their time to overthrow their own equals and to subdue their whole home
state temporarily. The tyrants were often compelled to introduce the coin
economy pattern into the area over which they ruled, or at least to promote
its development officially, in order to gain the upper hand over their
enemies...
To stabilize the position of the peasantry on the land, and to
expand and rebuild state economy, a central distribution of money and goods
in kind partly directed towards mercenaries, bodyguards and various
political friends, and partly indirectly to the masses of poor people in the
form of wages paid for extensive building operations and improvements, is
characteristic of tyrant economy...
The above remarks of Professor Heichelheim indicate there were new
political and economic possibilities in that period 650-500 B.C. when the
tyrannies most of all flourished...
The question then becomes, what were
these new political and economic possibilities?
... The answer is
arrived at readily; they derived from the activities of the agents of the
international silver bullion brokers, who, from ports such as Argos, Athens,
and Aegina where King Pheidon struck the first Greek silver coinage c.680
BC., promoted the luxury traders who sold their wares from wigs to harlots
as against the new silver coinage or promise thereof.
The opportunities
clearly were for those who assisted in the monetization of the city, and all
its activities and possessions, and its population, man, woman, and child,
and their possessions too, and thereby assisted in the firm establishment of
the rule of bankers, trade, and traders, as against the gods ruling over
mankind living in his natural order.
The aristocracies refused political equality to the landless traders and
manufacturers, the peasants were oppressed by the rich and encouraged to get
into debt and then were reduced to slavery and exile; slaves began to
compete with free labour. Ambitious individuals capitalized this discontent
to overthrow the constituted government and establish themselves as tyrants
in all the Greek cities with the notable exception of Sparta... (2)
The situation is very clear.
The kings and aristocracies as descended from
ancient days, as a derivative of their folly in permitting the unrestricted
activities of the new bankers, who were now well established in all the
major cities of Greece outside of Sparta, saw a class of manufacturers and
entrepreneurs come into being, largely foreigners and men of lowly origin.
These men, more often than not with the means of nobility but the outlook of
slaves, were clearly a serious threat to kings and nobility and the order
they represented.
In the same manner during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries A.D., the
worthy tradesmen of London, while still deferring to the natural nobility of
the land, more and more realized, that they too were lords of the land
through control of labour by the wage rates and needed little encouragement
from that true source of their power, the bullion brokers, towards hatred of
a government (3) which still gave them little say, for all the wealth that
they were possessed of according to the new standards.
This government
still continued, at least until Charles I, to consider one of its main
duties was to prevent the oppression of the poor and the trusting, (4)
regardless of the so-called needs of trade.
The similar class that rose in Greece some two thousand years previously,
more and more realized that they were the new reality, and that they were
now in actuality the lords of the land through labour, which they owned
outright as slaves, or controlled as through daily wages. If the land
itself they still did not own and control, it mattered not; for there were
those voices that told them that land too was but a trade and a tool in the
new order.
As their textiles (as at Megara), or pottery (as at Corinth),
that every ship leaving harbour carried to the ends of the earth, so the
land of the great lord was but the capital investment that grew the food
that he the manufacturer purchased for himself and his slaves or the raw
materials needed for his particular trade; and he himself, in the money
creators kingdom on earth, was as assessable in coin as was potter, weaver,
or armored.
The land owning nobleman was a man controllable as themselves
through the arts of taxation in terms of money, could they but institute a
system of government in which the natural ruler had no more power to rule
than themselves...
No doubt these worthy tradesmen of Megara, or Corinth, or Athens, led on by
the attitude of their true masters, the trapezitae, the money creators,
agents of those great and ancient banking houses of Babylon city, said to
themselves of the natural lords of Hellas Who are these men?...
For
all their fine manners and clothing, we could buy them up a hundred times
did they but know it!
And so the stage was set for the arrival of the tyrant financed into
existence by the bankers towards the total destruction of the old way of
life, which still had within it the seeds of a strength sufficient to root
out its enemies such as, in the case of Sparta, had been outstandingly
proven by the renewal of the ancient life system through the financial and
social reforms of Lycurgus.
Classes of manufacturers and entrepreneurs,
contemptuous of a nobility that seemed to have betrayed its trust, were
easily stirred to envy and resentment, and the work of destruction by the
tyrant received little or no opposition.
In order to level the class of large landowners and nobles economically,
Theagenes of Megara simply allowed their herds of cattle to be slaughtered
without remuneration. A frequent political device of tyrants from Asia
Minor to Sicily was to murder or banish nobles, confiscate their
possessions, and redistribute their wealth amongst the poor. (5)
The poor, needless to say, soon returned to being poor again...
The poor ye
shall always have with you.
The poor merely being those who trust that
their rulers are attending to serious matters as indicated by their position
in the scale of life, such as governing.
The word poor having existed, of
course, long before the crafty banker, standing in the shade beside the ways
of life, arranged it that measure of poverty and riches was in that number
of (privately issued) units of exchange in which a man could be assessed
according to success or failure in the conflict of life, as he the banker
had established it.
The tyrant, therefore, was that force by which international money power as
it derived from the control of silver bullion and the slave markets,
destroyed all resistance to its total ownership of life and labour and human
hope...
The status of all, slave or free, in some degree, depended on
their relations with the trapezitae who presided at their table in the agora; and should they be kings or rulers of states, no doubt their destinies
would be much influenced by those shadowy figures furtively watching from
the counting houses of far away Mesopotamia...
According to the special
nature of the times, the tyrant, in his capacity as ruler, would above all
be guided instrument; but that the tyrant no more understood the true
significance of his existence than do these so-called revolutionary
leaders of today, is a certainty...
The so-called revolutions of today are clearly similar in their origins to
those of the time of the tyrants; the main difference being more of a
technicality...
Until 1870 A.D. the arbitrary valuation of gold bullion
as according to the decision of the bullion brokers, was common denominator
of values internationally, with silver bullion in second place at the ratio
as decided by the leading states; but still rarely varying a great deal
from that ratio decided on nearly 2000 years ago by Julius Caesar and his
financial advisors, of 12:1. (6)
After the demonetization of silver in
almost all the major states of the world, in the seventies of the last
century, (7) the common denominator of values was gold alone, with silver
just another commodity moving up and down on world markets according to
supply and demand.
More than ample evidence exists of those persons designated international
bankers in Modern Times as also the instigative factor in the principle
so-called revolutions of the last three hundred years.
According to
Commander Guy Carr, (8) the so-called English revolution was totally the
work of the international bullion brokers who seem at that time to have been
lodged in Amsterdam, although the loan of silver bullion to Queen Elizabeth
I (9) for the recoinage that took place shortly after her accession to the
throne as negotiated by the famous Sicile, (10) later Lord Burghley, came
from Antwerp.
Some of the Crypto-Jews of the Commonwealth, (11) of whom many would have
been in England during the reign of Charles I, would also appear to have
been a factor in such revolution as witting or unwitting agents of the
Amsterdam bullion brokers... (12)
The main designer of the events of those
days seems to have been a Manasseh Ben Israel, a remarkable character, who
apparently took the initiative in the financing of Cromwell; (13) which
enabled Cromwell to obtain the best of arms, the first requisite of the
would-be conqueror throughout history.
The arrival of the Spanish and Portuguese Marranos (14) in Holland in 1593
A.D., with the consequent harnessing of the Dutch, a seafaring people,
naturally aggressive, to their world wide trade activities, and the
resultant so-called prosperity, immediately produced its impact in Britain.
The regrowth of the commercial power of these New Dutch, more especially
as deriving from the bullion trade which they seemed to continue to control
internationally, principally due to the connections they continued to
maintain in Spain, directed towards them a great part of the flood of the
precious metals which was being wrung out of the wretched natives of South
America particularly; not to speak of that which came from Japan, China,
and India, of which not so much seems to be known. (15)
No sooner did these
precious metals arrive in Spain or Portugal than almost immediately they
moved on to other parts in settlement of trade debit balances created
largely by the Spanish wars in Europe, particularly in Italy. (16)
This superfluity of the precious metals in Northern Europe certainly was one
of the instigative factors, in the growth of Banking, which had spread
from Venice and Genoa, to Amsterdam, and from thence to London, (17) where,
evinced by the activities of the goldsmiths, it had set itself up against
kings, as the whole story of the downfall of Charles I would indicate.
The political picture of Northern Europe derived a great deal of its
changing character from the rise in prices which came about both as a result
of the relatively tremendous influx of new precious metals at that time, and
as a result of the growth of Banking, that is private abstract money
creation, which affected prices equally with that precious metal that could
be seen as it circulated as money.
Kings, often in the hands of the venal
advisors to whom the age gave rise, were no longer able to make both ends
meet, and not understanding the true nature of the activities of the bankers
or goldsmiths, they neither knew how to put a stop to such activities nor,
if they permitted them, how to tax them...
The sullen resistance experienced by Charles I from the puritanical and
self-righteous burghers of the City of London, (18) most of whom were by
then deeply beholden to the goldsmiths for their finances, who, in their
turn were no doubt beholden to the Amsterdam bullion brokers for the gold
they sometimes needed in a hurry when rumor went round that their receipts
which circulated as money, were largely false and had nothing behind them
except lies, may be traced to these same bullion brokers of Amsterdam...
Their policy above all required the weakening of kingship in England, for
the Banking monopoly they saw they might come to institute in England,
could not flourish with a king on the throne such as Charles who truly
regarded himself as the Lords anointed... A king who was aware of the
source of his power, even if not widely instructed therein, that is to say,
who was aware of the true meaning of monetary creation and emission relative
to his kingship, was not much to their liking....
The reinstitution of
the office of a Royal Exchanger, abolished by Henry VIII in 1539 on the
advice of a Sir Thomas Gresham, (19) was also not much to their liking, nor
the seizure by Charles of the £130,000 deposited in the Tower supposedly by
the London merchants, reputed to have come from Spain en route to Dunkirk,
Spanish possession at that time...
The reinstitution of the office of
Royal Exchanger meant that one of the major sources of revenue of the
goldsmiths, and therefore their masters, the bullion brokers was cut off:
that which obtained from the exchange of coins, foreign or domestic; which
meant, therefore, they were denied the opportunity to clip, or sweat, or
retain for export those full-weight coins that came their way. (20)
The unsafe condition of a Bank under a Monarchy.
(21)
These words of Pepys indicate the trend of thought of certain circles at the
time.
Although Charles I could not be considered the most effective
opposition to banking and its proponents, nevertheless, he was in the way;
even if the cure to himCromwellproved perhaps to be even more in the way!
Cromwells Bills of Public Faith, of which very little record remains, a
true currency being intrinsically valueless, state issued, and
inconvertible, must have been cause for grave misgivings on the part of the
goldsmiths, and all concerned, as to whether they had done right in
supporting the enemies of the king!
It was not long after the return to the
throne of England of the Stuart Line in the person of the amenable Charles
II, in 1660, that these Bills of Public Faith, the real key to
sovereignty, were repudiated; (22) showing that the son had even less
understanding of the realities of money than had the father. (23)
To return to Cromwell and the principal factors that lead up to his success,
and his assumption of the powers of tyranny: when it became clear that
Cromwell was as suitable a man as could be found to fit the needs of the
occasion, Manasseh Ben Israel supplied him with the gifted Fernandez Carvajal, for the reorganization of his army, which became known as the
Model Army.
Trained revolutionaries then poured into the country,
presiding over whom was the Portuguese Ambassador, a De Souza, who loaned
them the diplomatic immunity of his house for their meetings. One such
revolutionary was the man known today as Calvin, whose father had been
fiscal agent to a prominent French Bishop. (24)
These revolutionary leaders, besides developing the technique of spreading
religious differences, also exploited the use of truculent mobs, a practice
known to this class of people from most ancient times, for the gaining of
political ends.
According to Commander Guy Carr, who is a relatively recent
writer on this subject: (25)
The evidence which absolutely convicts Oliver
Cromwell of participating in the revolutionary plot was obtained by Lord
Alfred Douglas, who edited a weekly review known as Plain English published
by the North British Publishing Company. In an article which appeared in
the issue of Sept. 3rd 1921, he explained that he and his friend, Mr. L.D.
Van Valckert of Amsterdam, Holland, had come into possession of a missing
volume of records of the Synagogue of Muljeim. This volume had been lost
during the Napoleonic Wars.
The volume contained records of letters written
to and answered by the directors of the Synagogue.
They are written in German. One entry dated June 16th, 1647 reads: From O.C. (i.e.) Oliver Cromwell to Ebenezer Pratt.
In return for financial support will advocate admission... to England;
this however impossible while Charles living. Charles cannot be executed
without trial, adequate grounds for which do not at present exist.
Therefore advise that Charles be assassinated, but will have nothing to do
with the arrangements for procuring an assassin, though willing to help in
his escape.
In reply to this dispatch the records show E. Pratt wrote a letter dated
July 12th, 1647 addressed to Oliver Cromwell.
Will grant financial aid as soon as Charles removed and... admitted.
(26) Assassination too dangerous. Charles should be given an opportunity to
escape. His recapture will then make trial and execution possible. The
support will be liberal but useless to discuss terms until trial commences.
On November 12th, that same year, Charles was given the opportunity to
escape. He was, of course, recaptured. Hollis and Ludlow, authorities on
this chapter of history, are both on record as considering the flight as the
stratagem of Cromwell.
After Charles had been recaptured, events moved
apace. Cromwell had the British Parliament purged of most of the members he
knew were loyal to the King. Notwithstanding this drastic action, when the
house sat all night on December 6th, 1648, the majority agreed That the
concessions offered by the king were satisfactory to a settlement.
Any such settlement would have disqualified Cromwell from receiving the
blood money promised him by the international money barons through their
agent E. Pratt, so Cromwell struck again. He ordered Colonel Pryde to purge
Parliament of those members who had voted in favour of a settlement with the
King. What then happened is referred to in history books as Prydes purge.
When the purge was finished, fifty members remained. They are recorded as
the Rump Parliament. They usurped absolute power. On January 30th, 1649,
he was publicly beheaded in front of the banqueting house at Whitehall,
London... Oliver Cromwell received his blood money just as Judas had done.
(27)
On the same somewhat obscure page of history, Professor Andreades pointed
out in his History of the Bank of England, (28) that Cromwells best known
historians pay little attention to the subject of his relations with the
Jews and their return to England. Carlyle and Morley devoting no more than
a page to this highly controversial event. (29)
The reader gains the
impression that more was to be said on the subject...
He asserts himself:
It is certain that as soon as Charles I was dead, the Jews attempted to
return to England. (30)
The following statements by Benjamin Franklin in
reference to the causes of the American Revolution are equally illuminating:
About this time (the time of the Treaty of Paris, 1763), Benjamin Franklin
made a visit to England. While there he was asked how he accounted for the
prosperous conditions of the colonies. His reply was: That is simple. It
is only because in the colonies we issue our own money. It is called
Colonial Scrip and we issue it in the proper proportion to the demands of
trade and industry.
(See Senate Document No. 23, Page 98, by Robert L.
Owen, (31)
former Chairman, Committee on Banking and Currency, United States
Senate.)
Robert L. Owen continues:
It was not very long until this information was
brought to the Rothschilds Bank, and they saw that here was a nation ready
to be exploited; here was a nation setting up an example that they could
issue their own money instead of the money coming through the Banks. The
Rothschilds Bank caused a bill to be introduced in the English Parliament.,
therefore, which provided that no colony of England could issue its own
money.
They had to use English money. Consequently the colonies were
compelled to discard their scrip and mortgage themselves to the Bank of
England (the Amsterdam Bullion Brokers!) to get money. For the first time
in the history of the United States our money began to be based on debt.
Benjamin Franklin stated that in one year from that date the streets of the
colonies were filled with the unemployed, because when England exchanged
with them, she gave them only half as many units in payment in borrowed
money from the Rothschild as they had in scrip. In other words, their
circulating medium was reduced 50%, and everyone became unemployed according
to Benjamin Franklins own statement.
Continuing the quote from Senate Document No. 23:
Mr. Franklin went
further than that. He said that this was the original cause of the
revolutionary war. In his own language: The colonies would gladly have
borne the little tax on tea and other matters had it not been that England
took away from the colonies their money which created unemployment and
dissatisfaction. (32)
The French Revolution, so called, left much less evidence of its origins
than the so-called Russian Revolution 120 years later, though the
instigating factor is clear enough.
The French Revolution by Nesta Webster,
The Life of Napoleon by Sir Walter Scott, almost unobtainable, and above all
the chapters in God and the Goldsmiths by McNair Wilson, on Napoleon
Bonaparte, give some light on this matter. A study of Louis XV and his
relations to the Pâris Brothers, the state tax farmers, especially through
Madame Du Pompadour, formerly Poisson, possibly illegitimate child of Pâris
Duverney and god-daughter of Pâris Monmartel, yields impressions.
The writings of Necker, front man for the
international bankers of the time, and who Mirabeau described as the Hero
who arrived by famine should be read, and also the writings of Turgot,
finance Minister to Louis XVI, who fought against Necker and the evil
fraternity behind him, and who nicely summed up the situation in his first
memorandum to Louis XVI as follows:
So long as finance shall be continually subject to the old expedients in
order to provide for state services, your Majesty will always be dependent
on financiers, and they ever will be the masters, and by the maneuvers
belonging to their trade they will frustrate the most important operations.
Thus the government can never feel itself at ease, it can never be
acknowledged as able to sustain itself, because the discontents and
impatience of the people are always the means made use of by intriguing and
ill-disposed men in order to excite disturbance. (33)
Clearly the Minister Turgot was a man of sincerity and integrity, a true
God-servant, and the fact that it was only after prolonged scheming on the
part of the international bankers, who mostly lived outside of France, that
he was dismissed, (34) would suggest that his master also sought to do that
which he was borne to do, that is, love, guide, and protect the people...
But neither master nor man understood the strength of the undercurrents
which flowed, nor, it is to be feared, the true meaning of letat cest
moi!... which in essence means,
I am the fount of Life. I am that point
through which the Almighty God injects your money amongst you that binds you
together as one. I, and no other; not my steward, nor servant, faithful or
unfaithful...
The men of intrigue he referred to, were such stewards, the international
bankers.
These men, standing behind thrones intercepted that God-Power from
on high which was the force behind letat cest moi!, and, controlling the
value of money of whatever kind, and therefore international price levels,
with responsibility only to them and theirs, confused the nations with their
sly schemes of fatuous purpose.
The instigating factor of the Russian Revolution so-called is common
knowledge and is detailed in a hundred books. Perhaps one of the best
sources of information relating to the financing of the same Russian
Revolution is the book Czarism and Revolution written by Arsene De
Goulévitch, a former officer of the Czars army and founder of the Union for
the Defense of Oppressed Peoples.
According to information deriving from the French Secret Service, one of the
principal sources of finances for the International Revolutionary Movement
prior to 1917, was Jacob Schiff of the International banking firm of Kuhn,
Loeb, and Company, based in New York City. It was recorded that twelve
million dollars had been donated to the revolutionaries by Schiff, in the
years preceding the war of 1914-1918. This fact is apparently confirmed and
amplified from sources other than the French Secret Service. (35)
The main funds for the so called Revolution and towards the steps which
led up to it, do not appear to have come from that class of nouveau riche
bred into being in Russia out of the activities over the previous 50 years,
of the joint stock banks, and the men such as Sawa Morozov, and Tereschenko,
(36) the socialistic sugar magnate.
The extensive funds so necessary
towards the effective disruption of a major state appear to have come from
certain British and American circles, which it seems, had been lending their
support to the Russian revolutionary cause, for a long time.
In his book,
My Life, Trotsky speaks of a large loan granted in 1907 by a Financier
belonging to the so-called Liberal Party in Britain. This particular
British financier was apparently not alone in his monetary support of the
Revolution in Russia. (37)
The conduct of Jacob Schiff, previously mentioned, towards Czarist Russia,
once he was installed as head of the New York International Banking firm
of Kuhn, Loeb, and Company, was that of an apparently unyielding enemy.
References to his anti-czarist activities exist in the book by Cyrus Adler:
Jacob Schiff, his Life and Letters. (38)
Further verification of the activities of Jacob Schiff is afforded by the
New York Journal American of February 3rd, 1949; a time when
pro-revolutionary activities were The Thing in New York City: (39)
today
it is estimated by Jacobs grandson, John Schiff, that the old man sank
about $20,000,000.00 for the triumph of Bolshevism in Russia. (40)
According to Goulévitch (P. 231), various other persons well known in the
world of international banking, whatever the expression International
Banking might mean, (41) were also known to be associated with support of
revolutionary activities.
The ruin to the states of the world set on foot
by these immensely rich, but otherwise trifling persons, whose solidarity,
however, had enabled them to so profit from the unbelievable expansion of
the use of Ledger Credit Page Entry Money in the Anglo-Saxon banking
systems, could not better demonstrate the absurdity of allowing private, and
therefore irresponsible, persons to exercise that power which should belong
to the gods alone, the power inherent in the creation and issuance of the
Unit of Exchange amongst the peoples.
In a speech made six weeks before the fall of the Kerensky Government, Lenin
made one of his most significant recommendations and perhaps the one most
suggestive of the possibility of his sincerity, even if in the rest he seems
to have been misguided. It was the one recommendation most indicative of
his awareness of the deep-seated causes of the conditions that had given
rise to himself and what he stood for...
Additional to proposing
nationalization of the great monopolies already existing in Russia,
(primarily as the result of the admission of joint-stock banking into the
country as concession to the victors of the Crimean war), above all he
recommended the total nationalization of banking.
In his own words he says:
...all banks to be merged into one and the state control its
operations, that is the nationalization of the banks.
...To talk about regularization of banks, continues Lenin, "means either
to betray complete ignorance, or to fool the simple folk with high sounding
words... to control the delivery of bread, or in general, the production and
distribution of goods, without controlling banking practices, is an
absurdity".
(Works of Lenin, XIV; Pt. 2; 182-183.) (42)
Of course, six weeks later, when Lenin had physically seized power with the
aid of his armed bandits, it was a small matter to set up printing presses
in the major cities in Russia that commenced to pour off paper roubles by
the billion.
Some fourteen or fifteen thousand workers were busily engaged
in the government printing shops of Moscow, Leningrad, Penza, Perm, and
Rostov-on-Don, turning out tons upon tons of paper money. The printing of
notes was simplified to a point where counterfeiting became easy... (43)
At the same time safety deposit boxes were seized, all accounts frozen and
the banks were closed, so that there was no addition to the circulation
existing outside of banks at the start of this operation, a great part of
which circulation would have been gold; and no new money came on the scene
other than the paper roubles of the Bolsheviki printing presses which
immediately took the place of that Ledger Credit Page Money by manipulation
of which the banks had previously controlled a great deal of trade.
For a year or two the Monarchist roubles were printed as if there was
intention to keep the people half expecting that the Czar would be coming
back, then for a short while a Kerenki rouble was printed, presumably
issue of the short lived Kerensky government, as if to prepare the people
for total resignation, and then finally, the Bolsheviki rouble which let the
people know that all was indeed lost.
This continuing the money of a
destroyed king seems to have been no new policy of international money
power, especially in the case of those kings, its particular enemies. An
illustration of which, occurring in ancient times, was the continued minting
at the Sardis mint of the sigloi of Croesus long after he had been destroyed.
The printing press money of the Russian Revolution entered the circulation
against government expenditures and against gold coin which it became
illegal to possess, no doubt being accompanied by an equal amount of
counterfeit, also exchanged against gold.
These vigorous moves must have been cause for some misgivings amongst the
bankers who continued to finance the Revolution so far as went Bolsheviki
needs in foreign exchange. But no doubt so closely surrounded was Lenin by
their agents, (44) they would have been justified in reasoning that they
would come out on top again without too much trouble, especially with the
new roubles being so easy to counterfeit. And during that period of the
so-called New Economic Policy, approximately 1920-24, they did so come out
on top...
In the archives of the State Publishers of Moscow is recorded the following
eulogy to the printing press as being as great a force in the so-called
revolution as armies:
Paper money of the Soviet Republic gave support to the young regime at the
most critical period of its existence when there was no possibility of
raising direct taxes to meet the outlays of the civil war. Hail to our
printing press! It is true that its days are numbered but it has already
completed three quarters of its work.
In the archives of the proletarian
revolution along with the cannon, rifles, and machine guns of our epoch that
vanquished the enemies of the proletariat, the place of honour will be given
to the printing press, the machine gun of the commissariat of finance that
poured fire into the rear of the bourgeois system and that made use of the
laws of currency and circulation of that regime for the purpose of
destroying it, and of financing the revolution. (45)
Typically enough the Tyrant himself, Vladimir I. Lenin, saw little or no
profit out of all this, for himself, the Russian people, or that ideal of
world revolution in which it appears he sincerely believed. If he truly was
the author of the above statements regarding banking, then, when he died not
so long after all these events, it was as a weary and disillusioned man.
For that gold, still very much the base for total control of world finance,
which was wrung from the Russian people during the period of terror between
1917 and 1922, seems to have almost all found its way back to the
Benefactors of the original revolutionaries, Messrs.
Kuhn, Loeb, and
Company of New York (Jacob Schiffs firm), and it must have been clear to
Lenin by the time he died in 1924 that he was but agent of a force that
regarded him as merely another tool to be used towards the making of that
which they designed.
Mr. Bakhmetiev, the late Russian Imperial Ambassador to the United States,
tells us that the Bolsheviks, after victory, transferred 600 million roubles
in gold between the years 1918 and 1922, to Kuhn, Loeb, and Company
(Schiffs firm), (46)
... which makes pretty good return for the mere
20,000,000 dollars granted by the philanthropic Mr. Schiff and which would
have been as credits against purchases at that!
At that time such amount of gold could be used to form the apex of an
inverted pyramid of abstract money equal in amount to beyond thirty times
the number of units such gold represented in U.S. currency according to its
official price...

15. According to the letters of Quang Chang Ling (1878); (History of the
Precious Metals; P. 348; A. Del Mar ): It was in the year 1498 that the
Portuguese made their way around the Cape (of Good Hope). In 1510, under
Albuquerque, they treacherously seized the East Indian city of Goa, and
leaving a garrison in it, sailed away to Malacca which they had seen and
coveted in 1508... They plundered Malacca of a booty so enormous that the
Quinto, or fifth, of the king of Portugal amounted to 200.000 gold cruzados,
a sum equivalent to $5,000,000.00...
We have our own theory concerning the sources of your present riches. We
ascribe it in part, to your gains from the piratical conquest, enslavement
and murderous extinction of the American races, but chiefly to the
profitable trade with the Orient. From the opening of this trade to 1640,
when the Portuguese were driven from Japan, and the British first acquired
territory in Hindustan, three of your European nations alone took a thousand
million dollars in gold and silver from Asia; two thirds as much as they
wrung from all America during the same period. From Malacca alone they took
25.000.000; from Japan, up to the date mentioned, four hundred millions;
from India and China still greater sums (in gold or silver coin, or bullion)...

23. Charles II was totally in the hands of the bankers and goldsmiths as is
revealed by the following extract from D. MacPhersons Annals of Commerce,
(P. 428). Charles being in want of money, the bankers took 10% of him
barefacedly, and by private contracts on many bills, orders, tallies and
debts of that King, they got 20, sometimes 30% to the great dishonour of
Government. This great gain induced the Goldsmiths to become more and more
lenders to the King, to anticipate all the revenues, to take every grant of
Parliament into pawn as soon as it was given; also to outvie each other in
buying and taking to pawn bills, orders and tallies, so that in effect, all
the revenue passed through their hands.

Frederick Harrison says in his biography of Oliver Cromwell: Noble were
the efforts of the Protector to impress his own spirit of toleration on the
intolerance of his age... He effectively protected the Quakers; he
admitted the Jews after an expulsion of three centuries, and he satisfied
Mazarin that he had given to Catholics all the protection that he dared...

31. Robert L. Owen was the senator who wrote and introduced the legislation
setting up the Federal Reserve (Central Banking) system in 1913. His
foreword to a book written by a Miss Gertrude Coogan shows that he lived to
bitterly regret his part in writing and introducing this Bill. The remark
made later by President Wilson, who had paved the way for the Bill I am
a most unhappy man. Unwittingly I have ruined my country shows that
Owen was not alone in his remorse... The Central Banking System known as
the Federal Reserve System and towards the creation of which he had been the
principal instrument, though apparently state department in the same way as
the Bank of England, was in reality no more than the instrument through
which the so-called International Bankers harnessed the burgeoning energies
of the American peoples to themselves, their own world wide needs and
purposes. From first to last, which perhaps has not yet come, it was a
privately owned and controlled institution.

39. Although it is really very difficult to see what exactly would have been
left for this class of people, often multi-millionaires, to revolt against
by 1949, which also includes the hegemony of the Anglo-Saxon in the United
States.
40. Also according to the author of Czarism and Revolution (P. 224),...
in the Spring of 1917, Jacob Schiff openly boasted of having been
instrumental in overthrowing the Czarist regime...
41. According to Dr. Carroll Quigley (P. 52.) in the review by W. Cleon
Skousen outstanding characteristics of the international bankers were:
...they remained different from ordinary bankers in distinctive ways: (1)
they were cosmopolitan and international; (2) they were close to
governments and were particularly concerned with questions of government
debts... (3) their interests were almost exclusively in bonds and very
rarely in goods... (4) they were accordingly fanatical devotees of
deflation... (5) they were almost equally devoted to secrecy and the secret
use of financial influence in political life. These bankers came to be
called international bankers and, more particularly, were known as
merchant bankers in England, private bankers in France, and 'investment
bankers in the United States. In all countries they carried on various
kinds of banking and exchange activities, but everywhere they were sharply
distinguishable from other, more obvious kinds of banks, such as savings
banks or commercial banks.

Russia, P. 57; Columbia; 1937. Also see the article by Lenin in Pravda,
May 29th-30th, 1917: The threatening catastrophe and boundless promises.
Of equal interest and strikingly similar in the language used is the comment
of Lionel Rothschild on the subject of banking as quoted by Lord
Beaconsfield (Benjamin D'israeli) in 1844: "can anything be more absurd
than that a nation should apply to an individual to maintain its credit, and
with its credit, its existence as a state and its comfort as a people;...?
