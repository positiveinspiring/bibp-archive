Radical
Zionist sect Chabad seeks to to move to
Ukraine from the USA that the sect has already milked dry.
They want to build in Ukraine a "City on the
Hill", preventively destroying the local population just in case
On May 6, 2014, the deputy head of
Dnipropetrovsk, B. Filatov announced a sensation - the project
"Jewish Kiev":
-
What to do with those who sincerely
desire the death of my country, with the enchanting Russian idiots
who really do not understand why we are ready to kill them, with
vile Russian journalists whom we can't call humans?
-
With all this host of evil?
-
Tomorrow is a new day and the Sun will
rise. But what will all this evil do?
We must build a new country - "City on the
Hill", New Zion. Promised Land.
Through his subordinate, Ukrainian oligarch
I. Kolomoyski voiced his and
Dnepropetrovsk Chabad's ultimate goal:
to build in Ukraine a new state, the
promised land (sic), the new
Zion.
Has God promised a new promised land? It
already exists - in Israel.
Another Promised Land cannot be, but
Dnepropetrovsk Chabad and Kolomoyski, who finances and directs (not the head
of the [Ukrainian security] SBU, Nalyvaichenko) fascist punitive operation
in Donetsk and Lugansk, are trying to make Ukraine over into a promised
land.
Moreover, on Purim (March 16, 2014; date chosen to hit the Ukrainian Chabad
as much as possible), when the autonomy referendum was held in Crimea, Rabbi
of Dnepropetrovsk Shmuel Kaminetski said:
We have lived together with the Ukrainians
for 1000 years. Ukraine is our Land.
Today we will read the scroll of Esther, as
we have done over thousands of years on Purim. Today's reading is
particularly important. Today, a new Aman, our common enemy with the
Ukrainians, is very near.
The mention of Aman dwarfs the joke of
1,000 years together.
Who is this new Aman?
In the broad sense, it is Russia and Russians,
and more specifically - President Vladimir Putin whose plans thwart
Chabad - Lubavitch's new Zion in
Ukraine. The loss of Crimea hurt the plot by Kolomoyski and his US backers
led by the largest and most influential Chabad community in New York.
Even more painful is the process of separating
the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, and later, of the whole South - East
Ukraine.
Flimsy new Jerusalem began to fall apart as soon
as builders started it, because they lied and betrayed, sacrificed ordinary
Ukrainians with cruelty unprecedented for the 21st
century, shocking so many people.
Builders of new Khazaria unleashed all their
hatred of Russia and Russians, against Putin and his team, calling the new
Russian president Aman, thereby emphasizing his patriotism and understanding
of the enormous danger in the plans by Kolomoyski and the Chabad in Ukraine.
But even more important for grasping the root causes of Kolomoyski's Kiev
revolution is Kaminetski's reference to a millennial common history on
Ukrainian land. The rabbi does not know the history of
Kievan Rus and its people. He does speak
about the Khazar Empire.
Ninth century Khazars occupied a huge area from Astrakhan and the
Caspian Sea to the Dnieper, including the Crimea, with the White Tower
outpost in the north, from which arose the name of the Białowieża Forest
[squatting Poland-Belarus border region today - PB].
To White Tower area, Khazar Jews fled in the 10th
century after the defeat of Khazaria.
And now we are talking about a revival of the Khazars, with their centre
shifted to Dnepropetrovsk and, apparently, Ukraine as a contributor to the
"city on a hill" - the new Jerusalem. It means that Chabad - Lubavitch will
move from New York to Dnepropetrovsk, thus violating the natural course of
history, because it is in Jerusalem, in the State of Israel, that the Third
Temple must be rebuild for the throne of the king, whose coming is so
eagerly awaited by Jews world-wide.
But the Lubavitchers have their own view on the
historical perspective, as Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the last Rebbe
of Chabad - Lubavitch, who died in New York in 1994, is recognized as
Moshiach [Messiah]
who will rise from the dead.
In Dnepropetrovsk a temple was built for
Schneersona to sit on his throne, in the Chabad "Menorah" centre, Europe's
largest complex of this type.
So, the Lubavitchers no longer expect Moshiach
in Israel, but on the Ukrainian soil, recreating Khazaria, a new historical
homeland, because they don't remember Israel, and, apparently, don't wish to
have anything to do with the genuine Promised Land.
In his remarkable work zigzag history, academician of the Russian Academy of
Natural Sciences L.N. Gumilev very accurately predicts present events
in Ukraine.
At the beginning of the 9th
century Khazar coup, the second man to Hagan (prince, king) was a Jew,
Obadiah, son of
Dagestani warlord Bulan who converted to
Judaism.
Gumilev described a subsequent coup as follows:
-
Motives of the coup were not as much
religious as political, but had been covered up with fictitin to
hide the truth.
The same is observed in Ukraine: Maidan
victory on February 22, 2014, benefited those who had been shaping
people's anger at President Yanukovych and his corrupt cabal.
All those who have called the Ukrainian
people to revolt, to take action against the police and Special
Forces "Berkut", while spilling blood of Maidan defenders, gained
power by the right of conquest.
They all belong to Chabad Lubavitch, and
so have a lot of support in the USA and EU. Chabad has won the
revolution in Ukraine, but its goal was hidden deep in the bowels of
the new government. Owing only to lightning Crimean operation it
became clear to those who care about the fate of the Ukrainian
people.
The goal is to recreate Khazaria in
Ukraine, with Schneerson on the throne.
-
Obadiah was intelligent and connected to
the Jewish Diaspora.
For the "wise
men of Israel," he did not spare Khazar "silver and
gold". Political upheavals require money and organization.
Obadiah knew which circles to engage.
The coup benefited not the Khazars nor Khazar Jews but the invited
Jews and world-wide Jewry. It is them who have organized the coup,
while keeping to the basic principle: all public offices in Jewish
hands.
Obadiah received the title Bey,
which means malik (king) in Arabic, i.e. he headed the
government of nominal Khan (Kagan) who was kept in custody and
paraded before the people once a year.
Without doubt, Kolomoysky claims the
title of new Khazar king, while directing the Kiev government,
forcing them to comply with the orders of Chabad, namely its New
York wing that has a huge influence Obama administration.
Turchynov, Yatsenyuk, Avakov and Nalyvaichenko constitute just a
collective "nominal Kagan" for Kolomoyski, who distributes roles and
appoints his representatives to public office. Money and political
influence of Chabad Lubavitch helped the Maidan revolution as well
as the planning of the transformation of Ukraine for wealthy Jews, a
new Khazaria awaited for resettling to, after US collapse and before
the imminent war in the Middle East.
But ordinary Jewish communities (other than Chabad) lose with this
neighbor monster of international politics, as their business will
inevitably go down for IMF and ECB "professional" actions, aimed at
the redistribution of influence in the Ukrainian economy.
The oligarchs, long-time members of
Chabad, will benefit, having invested money and influence in the
revolution.
-
In 820s, a new Khazar order won, with
only a small loss of territory. A Christian Orthodox entity, Crimean
Gothia separated from the Khazars and joined the Byzantine Empire.
Recent accession of Crimea to Russia was due to the enormous
influence of the peninsula in Ukraine, on the entire Ukrainian
people. Besides, Crimea is the most important geostrategically in
the Black Sea region and the Middle East.
The neo-Khazar organizers in Washington
and Dnepropetrovsk know it well, but Putin was faster, leaving no
chance to the Kolomoyski junta nor their Chabad bosses. Both Ukraine
and the USA had to accept the loss of the Crimea, but tense
confrontation ensued between two ideologies of "independence".
Attitude towards Russia and Russians became a test for the tens of
millions of Ukrainians.
Those who considered themselves Russian,
grasped the goal of Kiev junta and rallied against it. Those who
considered themselves "ordinary" Ukrainians who hate Russia and
Russians, defend the junta's fascism, against their own interest,
remaining hostages who agree to the revival of Khazaria.
A civil war erupted from this
confrontation.
-
Obadiah's coup targeted tribal
aristocracy of all ethnic groups of the
Khazar Khanat that got on with the
Turkic dynasty.
A civil war erupted, with Hungarians
fighting on the rebel side, and mercenary Pechenegs on the Jewish
side. It was a ruthless war, as according to Babylonian Talmud, a
Gentile harming a Jew does it to God Himself [
] deserving death.
Annihilation of all on the enemy side was the rule in antiquity.
Obadiah obeyed it.
Kiev junta sent military units from W. Ukrainian regions and an
assault brigade from Dnepropetrovsk to S.E. Ukraine.
Not trusting the troops when ordered to
shoot at Ukrainians, in the rear Kolomoyski put the Right Sector
thugs of Chabad member Yarosh as well as his own assault troops,
both formations hired for considerable money.
The entire punitive military campaign is not paid by Kolomoyski, but
by his subordinate government of Yatsenyuk that fights Ukrainians
with their own money.
Such treachery is in the Chabad spirit
that rigidly suppresses expression by citizens of Ukraine, who
wanted only one thing: freedom - from anti-national junta, from the
dictates by Chabad oligarchs, from intoxicated revolutionaries who
kill the old and the young, women and children, for money.
Fueled by Chabad hate propaganda, this
bloodthirsty of fallen un-humans led to the grisly tragedy in Odessa
on May 2.
More than a hundred were burned alive and shot in Odessa's House of
Trade Unions. The cold-blooded bandits poured napalm on victim's
head and ignited it, and then filmed the living torches rushing
through the corridors - the epilogue of Kolomoyski fascism.
After that, Ukraine has changed forever.
From that moment, those who have shared
the joy of the executioners not be citizens of a free country, but
have become slaves to Chabad.
-
After this war, the beginning and end of
which is not amenable to dating, Khazaria changed its appearance.
From an integral system it has become an
unnatural, amorphous mass of subjects under the ruling class of
alien blood and religion. It's not feudalism, since an ethno-social
chimera escapes classification. Indeed, after May 2, 2014, Ukraine
has lost its previous statehood, never mind that under anti-people
government in Kiev.
Chabad brought Odessa holocaust to their altar, just like the
killing of Mariupol police officers on May 9, 2014, for refusing to
shoot civilians celebrating Victory Day.
Finally the name "Ukraine" and Ukrainian
culture were destroyed, becoming the symbol of horror fascism that
has grown from forced Ukrainization of the "Nenko" population.
No wonder that after the referenda on Donetsk
and Lugansk independence, the results of which surprised many analysts, the
secessionist federation's (Novorossiya, New Russia) militia began a total
destruction of Kolomoyski storm troopers.
Fight for freedom, supported by millions of
citizens in Ukraine, will now spill over beyond Donbass borders - westwards
to Kiev. Realizing this, Kolomoyski began to pump Ukrainian strategic oil
reserves and sell to EU.
The first tranche of the IMF loan did not go to
pay for Russian gas (an impossibility, according to Kiev junta's Russophobic
rhetoric), but was divided between the top of the
Dniepropetrovsk Chabad and the Ukrainian
oligarchs.
Amorphous Ukraine is collapsing, passing her
fate into the hands of New Russia and its staunch supporters and defenders.
Thus, attempts to revive Khazaria in Ukraine have failed completely, It
became clear that there would not be any return to the old life. Kiev junta
trembles before fleeing like
Yanukovych, but to the West.
Chabad Jews in Kiev create self-defense units
not to protect Kolomoyski junta, but to create exit corridors and to buy
time for export of their savings.
Fascist thugs continue punitive campaign against independent Donbass,
shooting Kiev soldiers in the back and finishing off the wounded, but this
rage is not as dangerous as a week ago.
The
Rubicon has been crossed, and the militia
of free republics rightly plan a march on Kiev and Dnepropetrovsk, in order
to finally destroy the lair of the fascist traitors and oppressors of New
Russia's free people. Memory of the victims of Odessa will not let the
militia regiments to stop at Donbass borders, but will lead them on, taking
in their ranks a growing number of those who "never forget, never forgive".
The fall of the Chabad and of Kolomoyski is
near. What next?
Under what conditions will the victors over
Dnepropetrovsk and Kiev fascism build a new state? This main question should
be resolved today, otherwise one regime will be replaced by another.
-
On what should Novorossiya's economy be
based?
-
Who will be the main owner of her huge
national assets, her land and natural resources?
Thus it is necessary to consider that the
western regions significantly differ from the eastern ones, as far as the
relation to property and collectivization of labor are concerned.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop the principle that strategic
enterprises become the property of the people, i.e. the state. Land property
is transferred in perpetuity to those who are not middlemen, but want to be
the master in construction and agriculture.
Natural resources can not be transferred into
private hands, foreign concessions or cartels citizens, but should be
national asset.
Political system should be changed:
from party lists to election in the
districts, cities and regions to Supreme Council, the representative
body of all segments of the population of New Russia.
These and many other questions need to be
addressed immediately, so that the entire Ukrainian nation understand the
ultimate goals of New Russia.
A leader of the anti-Khazar popular revolution
should declare these goals!
