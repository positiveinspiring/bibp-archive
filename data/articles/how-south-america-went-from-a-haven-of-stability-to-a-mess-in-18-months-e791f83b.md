# How South America Went from a Haven of Stability to a Mess in 18 Months

SANTIAGO, Chile
Imagine an
Obama administration official looking out at the world from the
vantage point of December 2015.
The Middle East is engulfed in
bloody conflict and crackdowns on domestic dissent. Africa is
muddling through a humbling correction to the success story
narrative that had been used to portray the continent's
preceding decade of dynamic growth and democratic progress.
Asia
is an uneasy landscape of shifting power balances and wary
hedging in the shadow of a newly aggressive China. And Europe is
struggling to address a refugee and migrant crisis that is
awakening a populist backlash to elite consensus.
At the time, if there was one part of the world that the
administration could have felt reasonably certain it would pass
off to its successor in better shape than when
Barack Obama took
office in 2008, it was Latin America, and in particular South
America.
If the preceding 15 years of progress were any indication, South
America's prospects were promising in December 2015.
Driven by
China's demand for commodities, the region had just ridden a
wave of prosperity that swelled the ranks of a burgeoning middle
class.
Left-wing governments in,
-
Brazil
-
Chile
-
Ecuador
-
Bolivia,
...had used progressive approaches to redistributive policy
to dramatically reduce poverty and expand access to health care
and education.
Meanwhile, parliamentary elections won by the opposition in
Venezuela had just signaled a course correction for the excesses
of the late
Hugo Chavez and his successors, who had combined
unsustainable economic policy with democratic regression.
Argentina's presidential election, won by
Mauricio Macri on a
program of structural reforms, suggested popular fatigue with
the personalized rule and economic chaos of Cristina Fernandez
de Kirchner's leftist government.
Finally, peace talks between the Colombian government and FARC
guerrillas seemed to have built enough momentum to make a
negotiated end to the country's 50-year civil war seem more
likely than not.
U.S. policy had little to do with most of these developments.
But when Obama took office in 2008, America's political capital
in Latin America had been depleted by eight years of
George W.
Bush's historically tone-deaf approach.
The Obama administration
restored Washington's legitimacy and credibility through a
combination of hands-off noninterference and its bold initiative
to begin normalizing ties with Cuba in December 2014.
Both components made it clear Washington had acknowledged what
the rest of the Western Hemisphere had known for some time: that
a page had turned in the region's history and its relations with
the U.S. - and the world.
Brazil was no longer a regional leader
but a champion of the Global South on the world stage.
The
countries of South America were as likely to look west to Asia
as north to the U.S. for trade, investment and aid. And with the
notable exception of Venezuela - and, to a lesser extent,
Ecuador and Bolivia - the continent was a model of democratic
expansion and consolidation.
The ongoing political circus
in
Brazil and Venezuela's
descent into dictatorship, famine and chaos
threaten to further derail the region.
A year and a
half later, the South American political landscape is
considerably more unstable, to the point of being almost
unrecognizable.
Things are far from doom and gloom, particularly
compared to the violence in the Middle East and geopolitical
tensions in Eastern Europe and Asia.
...have managed to register growth despite the commodities bust.
Argentina continues its uneven and painful corrections to the
Fernandez era's policy mismanagement, while Colombia continues
to implement its peace accord with the FARC in fits and starts.
But all are on less secure footing than they were 18 months ago,
with approval ratings for weakened leaders now low across South
America.
The transnational corruption scandal involving the
Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht has rippled outward to
implicate the political class of the entire region.
Most
recently, former Peruvian President Ollanta Humala was charged,
along with his wife, with receiving illegal campaign donations
from the firm in 2011 and ordered to await the outcome of the
investigation in jail.
In Chile, unrelated corruption charges
against the son of President Michelle Bachelet tainted her
second nonconsecutive term, and unsatisfying reforms to
education and retirement pensions have driven more popular
disenchantment with the center-left, but also the country's
political elite more generally.
In Argentina, too, there is a
sense of impending trouble, as proponents of painful structural
reforms begin to realize that the resulting benefits are
unlikely to fully kick in before parliamentary elections in
October.
More alarming are the two imploding stars that now threaten to
suck the region into their gravitational pull:
It's hard to understate the extent of Brazil's reversal of
fortune over the past year and a half.
Its economy, like those
of most of the commodity-exporting countries of South America,
had already weakened by December 2015. And popular
dissatisfaction with former President Dilma Rousseff was already
on display at the 2014 World Cup, where she was humiliated with
a shower of boos from the home crowd.
Still, few could have predicted the subsequent fall from grace,
not only for Rousseff, who was impeached in August 2016, but for
Brazil, which has since endured a year of political tragicomedy.
Its role as an emerging global power has been all but forgotten.
Its role as a regional leader - on anything other than
corruption - has likewise been torpedoed.
That takes on added significance in the context of Venezuela's
continued unraveling. What began as a political crisis there has
combined with an economic freefall, setting the stage for the
humanitarian tragedy currently on display.
That has implications
for neighboring Colombia, which could face a destabilizing flood
of refugees at a vulnerable moment for the ongoing
implementation of its peace accord.
As Frida Ghitis
argued in her WPR column last week, the U.S. should tread
carefully in seeking to shape outcomes in Venezuela,
particularly given the ways U.S. President
Donald Trump has
squandered the political capital accumulated by the Obama
administration on Cuba and damaged ties with long-standing
partners like Mexico.
For a host of reasons, the U.S. should
address Venezuela's crisis in concert with South American
partners, and ideally by letting South American countries take
the lead themselves.
In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Brazil played a
central role in resolving repeated tensions between Colombia and
Venezuela that at one point in 2008 saw then-President Chavez
deploy tanks to the border.
As recently as October 2015, the
regional body UNASUR
helped mediate border tensions between the two neighbors.
It's hard to see Brazil being able to bring the same influence
to bear on Caracas today, or lead a regional response if
Venezuela's turmoil spills over the border. And no other obvious
local replacement come to mind as a potential mediator.
South America is nowhere near the kind of conflict and
dysfunction on display elsewhere in the world these days. But it
is far from the haven of stability it represented just 18 months
ago.
Under normal circumstances, Washington would be paying
closer attention, but clearly these are not 'normal times'...
