How close are we to the collapse of the dollar
and complete debt forgiveness?
U.S. citizens will be the last to know that the
dollar is worthless.
Pluto entered Capricorn in 2008 and right
on schedule, we saw the collapse of hundreds of banks.
Pluto stays in
Capricorn until 2023 and we will continue to see the collapse of,
...right on schedule.
In the meanwhile, China is buying up the world's
gold reserve as they are vying to become the international currency for
trade, replacing the fiat dollar which is backed by nothing and is
essentially a worthless piece of paper.
In the following video, Jim Self explains
how the collapse of the dollar is inevitable.
China is in the process of creating a new
currency back by gold as they continue buying the world's gold reserves.
It is important to understand that the death of
the dollar is inevitable and it NEEDS to die in order for an asset backed
currency to replace it. When this happens, there will likely be a complete
forgiveness of all debt when the currency resets.
In a recent article on
goldseek.com, the following statement was
made:
"The
biggest shock waves will come from the currency reset followed by the
introduction of the Gold Trade Settlement.
The return of
the Gold Standard is near, but it will arrive on the trade vehicles, not
the FOREX currency or SWIFT bank platforms. It will feature the Gold
Trade Note, used as letter of credit."
According to Kate of Gaia,
the Federal
Reserve officially lost their charter on December 23, 2013 and because of
that, ALL currency has been deemed completely worthless.
Kate stated,
"Every fiat currency on this planet is
effectively worthless."
Go to the 56:20 of this video:
Greed and corruption in the name of profit has
led to the poisoning of our water, air and food supplies. In a world that
does not rely on economic slavery, it is unlikely that any of these systems
would be contaminated in the name of eugenics.
As many of us know, the prices of gold and
silver have been artificially manipulated by the Federal Reserve, who
continues to pump worthless fiat currency into the stock market to create a
false sense of security to various shareholders.
In essence, the dollar is already dead.
It
officially died when the United States
went off the gold and silver
standard.
When a currency has no backing by silver, gold
or any other precious asset, it is only worth the perceived value that is
printed on it.
For example, it costs about as much to print a
$1 bill as it does to print a $100 bill. Why does one piece of paper have
so much more perceived value when it's not backed by silver or gold?
According to some estimates, only 8% of the
world's currency is actual cash. The rest is composed of electronic funds.
If you were to take out a housing loan, there is
no actual exchange of cash as numbers are simply generated through a
computer, including the fictitious interest rate you are charged. We have
been assimilated into a society where we use debit cards for everything from
purchasing gas to paying all of our bills.
The "official" announcement of the death of the
dollar is fast approaching, yet those who live in the United States will be
the last to know as the corporate elite will try to maintain this facade for
as long as possible. We have already seen a number of countries switch from
the U.S. Petro Dollar to other gold backed currencies as the U.S. dollar is
gasping its last breath.
Those who have been saving physical gold and
silver will likely see an extraordinary return on their investments as
silver is expected to rise to $700 or more per ounce while gold could
eclipse $30,000 per ounce.
While complete debt forgiveness would be
beneficial for many people, it would still mean that we will continue living
as economic slaves as long as money exists.
Jacque Fresco's 'Venus Project' shows us how we can all live in abundance
without the need for money.
In the video below, Michael Tellinger
shows how the
Ubuntu community can exist
where all community members only need to work 3 hours per week while
spending the rest of their time on whatever they would like to persue:
As you can see, there are alternatives to the
current economic slavery paradigm that exists, but in order for these to
come to fruition, the dollar needs to die.
Those who rely on materialism and economic
status will take it the hardest as their paradigm is rocked, but for those
who have been living in poverty or barely surviving as middle class
citizens, this will be a blessing.
In time, we will transition into a society that
no longer needs money or economic subservience.
Think of it this way: If a
UFO were to land in your driveway, there are 2 things the extraterrestrial
would not have:
Why? Because they have moved beyond
the need for either as they progressed into
Type 1 civilizations and beyond.
For many unawakened people, this will be a
"shocker" but for those who have been paying close attention, the
New Earth will begin in a relatively short period of time.
In the end, we will look back at these days of
economic slavery and will laugh at how ridiculous we were to fall for such a
ploy.
Our great grandchildren will ask,
"Why did you need money?"
In the meanwhile, the road might get a little
bumpy but in the end, everyone wins... except the banksters.
