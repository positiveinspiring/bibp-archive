The Salman Rushdie of Iraqi Kurdistan
The "blasphemous" book Sex, Sharia and Women in the History of Islam is
about how Islam and Sharia law are allegedly used to oppress Muslim women.
"I wanted to prove how oppressed women are in Islam and that they have no
rights," said Mr. Halabjaee. "My book is based on Islamic sources such as
the Holly Quran, Muslim and Bukhari books and many more."
Mr. Halabjaee was forced to flee to Norway from Iraqi Kurdistan because the
Islamic League of Kurdistan issued a "conditional" fatwa to kill him if he
did not repent and apologize for writing his book.
The "conditional" nature
of the fatal fatwa was uncertain at best.
Mr. Halabjaee reported,
"the
mullahs and scholars said if I go to them and apologize they will give me 80
lashes and then refer me to the fatwa committee to decide if I am to be
beheaded. They might forgive me, they might not."
Mr. Halabjaee received telephone calls saying,
"Now, in 10 years or 15
years, we will kill you."
Another time, Mr. Halabjaee reported,
"the
Islamists said once from the radio, if they found out where I was, they
would blow themselves up with me."
The worst thing was realizing his wife
and children were in danger.
"With that book I wanted to defend women but
the first thing I did was hurt my wife."
As a result, Mr. Halabjaee went
into hiding with his pregnant wife and three children.
Mr. Halabjaee fled Iraqi Kurdistan after the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)
refused to offer him any protection or to arrest those who threatened his
life.
"The Kurdish authorities have not provided any protection from threats
and fatwas," said Mr. Halabjaee, "any moment I am expecting a bullet or a
hand grenade to be thrown into where I live."
In response to the Halabjaee affair, the KRG Minister of Religious Issues,
Dr. Mohammad Gaznayi, told protestors that according to the law of Iraqi
Kurdistan, "defamation" or "criticizing" religion or religious figures is a
crime and its punishment is severe.
"We will give those who attack our
prophets a sentence so that they can be a lesson for everyone," said Dr. Gaznayi. [Dr. Gaznayi is the same KRG Minister of Religious Issues who said,
"I consider that those who turn to Christianity pose a threat to society."]
Mr. Halabjaee was in possession of a warrant for his arrest issued by the
Suleimaniya police department when he fled Iraqi Kurdistan.
In August 2006, Mr. Halabjaee was granted political asylum in Norway.
In December 2007, Mr. Halabjaee was convicted in absentia in Iraqi Kurdistan
for the crime of blasphemy. A court in Halabja sentenced Mr. Halabjaee to
six months in prison for writing that the prophet Mohammed had 19 wives,
married a 9-year-old when he was 54 years old, and committed murder and
rape. Mr. Halabjaee remains in hiding in Norway.
The sentence states that he
will be arrested upon his return to Iraqi Kurdistan.
