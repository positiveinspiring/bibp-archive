Dr. Mark Maybury, the United States Air
Force Chief Scientist, is stepping outside of the typical areas in which an
Air Force Chief Scientist operates and into the digital realm.
Maybury seeks to develop something he has dubbed Social Radar which would
monitor information coming from just about every source imaginable:
...and more, in order to look into the hearts
and minds of target populations and perhaps even predict future events.
The Department of Defense (DOD) and Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA)
have been working on technology along these lines for some time now but
Mayburys vision seems even more expansive and hard to believe than anything
Ive previously heard of or read about.
Maybury outlined his vision of a
Social Radar in a 2010 paper for The MITRE
Corporation, a government-funded entity.
This 11 page paper outlines just a few of the possible sources of data and
the goals the military has in mind for such a system, which are ambitious to
say the least.
Maybury chose Social Radar for a reason as he sees a strong parallel between
his vision and more traditional sensors.
The Air Force and the Navy in this and
other countries have a history of developing Sonar to see through the
water, Radar to see through the air, and IR [infrared] to see through
the night. Well, we also want to see into the hearts and minds of
people, Maybury said to Wireds
Danger Room.
However, Social Radar is quite different from
traditional sensor technologies in that it would not be a single sensor like
a fixed Radar installation, instead employing a massive amount of different
technologies across many disciplines in order to create the most complete
picture possible.
Also quite different from the run-of-the-mill physical sensor is the fact
that Social Radar actually hopes to see into the future in order to give
predictive intelligence for the military.
The previous failures of these technologies have become quite well known,
with the Pentagon failing to predict the uprising in Egypt with their
extensive, not to mention ludicrously expensive, technology.
Noah Shachtman, writing for Danger Room, says that the Social
Radar vision is,
part of a broader Pentagon effort to master
the societal and cultural elements of war - [an] effort that even many
in the Defense Department believe is deeply flawed.
Many argue that humans are truly unpredictable
beings and thus any attempts at predicting future events based on present
information is doomed to fail.
However, they said similar things about creating algorithms to predict and
game financial markets but high frequency trading has proven that it indeed
can be profitable.
Danger Room mentions the Pentagons downgrading of the role of
counterinsurgency (COIN) operations in their strategy revamp, while also
pointing out that the need to find potential flashpoints is not going away
any time soon.
However, they seem to be taking the position of our military complex which
has become so obsessed with interventionism and nation building.
They cite the need,
to understand how American actions might
impact those restive populations,
...in conflict areas while failing to point out
that what Americans should be doing is staying out of the lives of such
restive populations entirely.
They mention the fact that American special forces are training foreign
armed forces around the world, aptly point out that such actions are
impacting the people of those countries while failing to point out just
how fruitless such strategies are.
Of course, they are only fruitless for those who seek peace and order, for
those who rake in massive
profits from chaos, war and death are likely giddy
at the prospect of the United States training troops abroad in order to
continue the cycle of violence.
They also mention,
the geopolitical chess match with China
along with covert wars in Yemen, Pakistan and Mexico, all which require
deep knowledge of all the pieces on the board,
...but once again fail to even consider the
possibility of the United States not taking a confrontational approach to
the world.
In researching this field I have come to the realization that the vast
majority of journalists, authors and researchers fail to even consider the
fact that this conflict-oriented approach need not be a given.
The concept of Social Radar is much like what the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) is
already doing in the United States.
However, it appears that Mayburys Social Radar would be much more
comprehensive in the media it collects compared to the domestic programs
which mostly monitor social media websites, blogs, social media trend
tracking websites, news websites, etc. whereas Social Radar would integrate
just about everything you can think of.
The domestic programs being used to spy on the American people currently,
like Mayburys Social Radar, regularly claim to be preserving the privacy of
users, or in the case of the domestic programs, they claim they do not
collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
However, Maybury admits himself just a few paragraphs after making the claim
that Social Radar will indeed use
biometrics to identify people and
sociometrics to identify groups.
Maybury calls this creating signatures which can be used to track and
identify various target,
-
individuals
-
groups
-
sentiments
-
behaviors
He also emphasizes the need to keep the
collection passive and anonymous, bypassing attempts at deception,
obfuscation, and censorship.
Considering all of these factors and the so-called signatures Social Radar
will use, it is hardly arguable that the privacy of users will be preserved.
In a time when the United States has absolutely nothing to spend, Mayburys
project seems wildly over the top and a massive waste of taxpayer funds.
Even Danger Room has to note the seeming absurdity of this project
writing,
It sounds almost laughably ambitious. And
Maybury agrees the notion may be more of a long-term organizing
metaphor than a particular program.
However, Maybury argues that the foundation of
Social Radar is already there with the MITRE Corporation pursuing several
projects which could help realize his vision.
One of the most critical aspects of the Social Radar would be so-called
sentiment analysis which attempts to discern whether a piece of writing is
positive or negative in sentiment.
This is much like what the webbot supposedly does in order to create trend
forecasts.
Such aggregated sentiment analysis would then be tied to geographical
locations, and tracked in real time, very similar to what
the Federal Reserve is trying to do in the
United States but likely even more sophisticated.
The Pentagon has already spent over $125 million (that we know of, given the
massive black budgets that exist the number might be much larger) over three
years on technology which attempts to quantify model and foresee human,
social, cultural and behavioral (HSCB) factors.
HSCB systems are already being used in several American military units
around the world.
The Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) run by DARPA is
set to be expanded into six DOD geographical commands, totaling some 175
different nations.
There is a great deal of opposition to technology like this, even within the
Pentagon itself.
One internal review of HCSB projects pointed out that,
Project supporters have marshaled evidence
to demonstrate the validity of its approach, while critics have pointed
to deficiencies in the scorekeeping method that exaggerate the accuracy
of ICEWS forecasts.
Commenting on the viability of this approach,
Lieutenant General Paul Van Riper (retired) said,
They are smoking something they shouldnt
be, to Science magazine.
However, Maybury sees it quite differently,
saying,
Just like nobody could imagine seeing
through the night or seeing through water, nobody can imagine seeing
attitudes. And actually, in my view, thats very much a future reality.
Danger Room points to some related projects like
a study funded by the Air Force Research Lab carried out by David Matsumoto,
a San Francisco State University psychology professor, which is trying to
discover universal markers of deception.
They also point to
a presentation by Maybury on the Air
Forces contributions to the militarys HCSB efforts.
In this presentation, Maybury cites a city-wide spying program called
Metropolitan Area Persistent Sensing along with some other dubious
projects like,
micro munitions that limit collateral
damage along with non lethal directed energy weapons,
...like the now infamous pain ray which was
reportedly scrapped after being deployed to Afghanistan.
Maybury laughably says that these supposedly non-lethal technologies (which
arent always non-lethal as we saw in
the case of Nick Christie who was murdered
by police who sprayed his naked body with pepper spray many times) are
important because,
preservation of human life is a premium
when one is attempting to generate support of the local population,
stability and security while not increasing grievances.
Yet, like the author of the article itself,
Maybury seems to pass over the possibility that we might be much better off
not even involving ourselves in situations which require,
attempting to generate support of the local
population.
When we have record numbers of Americans
struggling to find food to eat or afford a roof over their head, should we
really be spending countless amounts of money in foreign nations?
Maybe our military could benefit from stepping back and considering the fact
that we do not need to pursue this technology at all if we do not plan on
engaging in perpetual war which, unfortunately, seems to be exactly what
the powers that be intend to do.
