Big Lenders Face Few Hard
Consequences
for Violating Anti-Money Laundering
Laws
...and not a few others, have a common
bond beyond ranking among the largest banks in the world.
All have been accused within the past five years
(and several this year) of failing to comply with US anti-money laundering
laws - thereby enabling, collectively, hundreds of billions of dollars worth
of suspicious transactions to move through the banking system absent
adequate monitoring or oversight.
Yet not one these banks, nor any of their top
executives, has been hit with criminal sanctions.
All, with the exception of Britains HSBC (which is still under investigation),
have agreed to pay fines for their
alleged transgressions after being served cease-and-desist orders or have
entered into so-called deferred-prosecution pacts - under which a lender
agrees to pay a fine and to comply with the law going forward in exchange
for dismissal of all charges at the end of a specified government monitoring
period.
But again, not one bank has been charged with a
crime nor have any top executives been forced to do the perp walk, bound by
handcuffs, in front of the adoring media throng.
Imagine if you or I were pulled over by the cops
while transporting in the trunk of our car even $10,000 in bills that traced
back to individuals suspected of being involved in illegal activities, such
as narco-trafficking.
What are the odds that we would walk away with only a
traffic ticket?
Thats essentially what is happening in these
cases involving big banks, who, for all practical purposes, are allowing
their money transportation systems to be rented, for a fee, by criminals,
while the banks leadership pleads ignorance:
I didnt know that money was in the trunk.
Ill have to look into that.
Now, if you take that same $10,000, or even
millions of dollars, and put it inside an armored car under contract to a
big bank, suddenly the dirty money gains the presumption of legitimate
commerce, and is likely to have a police escort as opposed to being
subjected to a police inspection.
All financial crime has a money laundering
component, says Charles A. Intriago, president of the Miami-based
Association of
Certified Financial Crime Specialists.
If youre an individual,
and get caught, you get hammered.
But if youre a big bank, and youre caught
moving money for a terrorist or drug dealer, you dont have to worry.
You just fork over a monetary penalty, and then raise your fees to make
up for it.
Until we see bankers walking off in
handcuffs to face charges in these cases, nothing is going to change,
Intriago adds.
These monetary penalties are just a cost of doing
business to them, like paying for a new corporate jet.
Broken System
The worlds financial system is incredibly
complex and capable of moving trillions of dollars in many directions,
across multiple borders, with the push of a button in our
digital age, making it difficult for banks to truly know their customers
in all cases.
Still, the law demands that they do just that,
and have systems in place to assure against money laundering.
From the regulators perspective, suspecting
that a transaction is dirty is not the same as proving it is so. Financial
crimes, by design, are hard to track and involve a considerable expenditure
of law enforcement resources to investigate and litigate.
Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the US Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which regulates national banks, when
interviewed by Narco News, stressed that his office is charged with
enforcing a wide range of legal and regulatory matters, and has a number of
enforcement actions underway at any given time, but it does not have a
special focus on money laundering - though, he adds, the OCC is committed
to enforcing anti-money laundering laws.
Given the reality of scarce resources,
anti-money laundering laws depend, in large measure, on having the banks
police themselves - by assuring that suspicious activity reports are filed
with regulators when transactions exceed certain monetary thresholds or
dont pass the smell test, or that compliance departments are well-staffed
and on top of their systems.
The problem, however, is that there are many
holes in that system, due, in large measure, to lax enforcement by
overworked or even incompetent regulators - with the added problem that some
of those regulators see the lenders they regulate as potential future
employers.
For example, theres the case of HSBC (the
subject of a recent US Senate investigation focused on suspected
money-laundering activities).
One of the former chief compliance officers
for the lender's US subsidiary (called HBUS) served previously as a bank
examiner for the OCC,
US Senate records show. In addition, two of HBUS past Anti-Money
Laundering directors worked previously for the US government - one as a
federal prosecutor and the other as a US Treasury official.
And, in equal measure, similar
power-relationship problems exist within bank compliance departments, whose
employees can put at risk millions of dollars in revenue if they
aggressively pursue money-laundering suspicions - with another downside
being that if they are wrong, they risk angering powerful bank customers as
well as their bosses.
It is that cycle of disincentives that makes it
far easier for crooks to get in the door in the first place, because the
risk of a bank getting caught violating anti-money laundering laws simply
doesn't seem to outweigh the benefits of looking the other way.
This past August,
Standard Chartered agreed to pay a $340 million fine to get a New York
bank regulator off its back after the British lender was accused of
illegally concealing billions of dollars worth of transactions related to
Iranian interests, in violation of US laws.
That fine of $340 million represented only
4.5 percent of Standard Chartereds profits in 2011, Intriago points
out.
Its chump change to the bank.
Repeating History
But Standard Chartered isnt alone in standing
accused of using the US banking system to move money for shady characters.
In the 1990s, Raul Salinas de Gortari, the
brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas, tapped US-based Citibank
to help transfer up to $100 million out of Mexico and into Swiss bank
accounts. Although US
authorities investigated the suspicious money movements, ultimately no
charges were brought against Raul Salinas or Citibank - a Citigroup Inc.
subsidiary.
Again, in January 2010, Citigroup popped up on
banking regulators radar, this time in Mexico, when a
Mexican judge accused a half dozen casa de cambios (money transmitters)
of laundering drug funds through various banks, including Citigroups
Mexican subsidiary. In that case, Citigroup again was not accused of
violating any laws.
However, in April of this year, a US bank
regulator, the OCC, issued a
cease-and-desist order against Citigroup due to the lenders,
internal control weaknesses, including the
incomplete identification of high-risk customers in multiple areas of
the bank.
Again, Citigroup was not charged with any
criminal violations and also did not admit or deny any wrongdoing, but
promised to
institute reforms.
Narco News is well aware of Citigroups banking
history, particularly in Mexico.
Narco News publisher Al Giordano and Mexican
journalist Mario Menendez, publisher of the Mexican daily Por Esto!, stood
as defendants in libel
litigation filed in 2000 against them by the powerful lender Banco
Nacional de Mexico S.A. (Banamex).
At the time, Banamex was controlled by
banker Roberto Hernandez Ramirez.
At the heart of the litigation, filed in New
York state court, was the following claim, spelled out in a
Dec. 5, 2001, New York Supreme Court ruling that dismissed the case
against Giordano and Menendez in a major victory for Internet publications
First Amendment rights:
Plaintiff [Banamex] alleges that defendants
[Giordano and Menendez] made accusations that Mr. Hernandez Ramirez is
involved in criminal drug trafficking and specifically, the Colombian
drug trade.
While the litigation against Giordano and
Menedez was still underway, Citigroup
struck a
deal, announced in May 2001, to acquire Banamex, then Mexicos second
largest bank, for some $12.5 billion in cash and stock.
Front Page
In recent months, money laundering in the
banking system has again been making front-page news due to the case of
HSBC, which found itself in the spotlight of a US Senate investigative
report released this past July.
The British lender was singled out for special
focus in the wake of an
OCC cease-and-desist order issued against it in October 2010, which
cited the lender for critical deficiencies in its anti-money laundering
compliance program.
The bank subsequently became the subject of a
US Justice Department probe and has set aside some $1.5 billion to cover
potential fines and costs related to settling the case, which, if history is
any a guide, likely will result in a deferred prosecution agreement - unless
Intriagos advice is heeded and criminal sanctions are pursued to their just
end.
Keep in mind that though $1.5 billion may seem
like a lot of money to regular folks, HSBC has assets exceeding $2.5
trillion and posted profits of nearly $22 billion in 2011.
HSBCs track record, as exposed so far in the
case, aren't pretty.
From the
US Senate report, prepared by the Committee on Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs and released July 17:
The identified problems [at HSBC] included a
once massive backlog of over 17,000 alerts identifying possible
suspicious activity that had yet to be reviewed:
-
ineffective methods for identifying
suspicious activity; a failure to file timely Suspicious
Activity Reports with U.S. law enforcement
-
a failure to conduct any due
diligence to assess the risks of HSBC affiliates before opening
correspondent accounts for them
-
a 3-year failure by HBUS [the banks
US subsidiary], from mid-2006 to mid- 2009, to conduct any AML
[anti-money laundering] monitoring of $15 billion in bulk cash
transactions with those same HSBC affiliates, despite the risks
associated with large cash transactions; poor procedures for
assigning country and client risk ratings
-
a failure to monitor $60 trillion in
annual wire transfer activity by customers domiciled in
countries rated by HBUS as lower risk
-
inadequate and unqualified AML
staffing
-
inadequate AML resources
-
AML leadership problems
Since many of these criticisms targeted
severe, widespread, and longstanding AML deficiencies, they also raised
questions about how the problems had been allowed to accumulate and why
the [US bank regulator] OCC had not compelled corrective action earlier
[prior to October 2010].
And HSBCs Mexican and US subsidiaries, HBMX and
HBUS, respectively, figure prominently in the financial carnage.
More from the Senate report:
HBMX used its banknotes account primarily to
sell U.S. dollars received from its customers [in Mexico] to HBUS, which
HBMX typically transported to HBUS via armored car or aircraft.
In one three-month period from November 2006
to February 2007, HBMX shipped nearly $742 million in U.S. dollars to
HBUS; at its peak, HBMX exported $4 billion in bulk cash shipments to
HBUS over the course of one year, 2008.
The Puebla Connection
One of the mutual clients of both HBUS and HBMX
is particularly problematic: a Mexican casa de cambio (or money exchange
house) called Casa de Cambio Puebla.
Puebla, which operated as a money laundering arm
of the Sinaloa narco-trafficking organization, also dragged another lender
into its mechanizations, US-based Wachovia, which has since been acquired by
US banking giant Wells Fargo.
The Senate report offers this insight into
Puebla and HSBCs subsidiaries:
In 2008, the United States indicted Puebla,
two of its officers, and two other individuals on drug smuggling and
money laundering charges.
In addition, in 2010, Wachovia Bank entered
into a
deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice
for having failed to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program
in connection with its casa de cambio business, including with respect
to Puebla.
Those legal proceedings, which involved a
major Mexican CDC [casa de cambio] and major U.S. bank, received
widespread attention.
Puebla was a longtime customer of HBMX.
In
2004, Puebla also opened a U.S. banknotes account with HBUS [in the US].
By 2007, Puebla had several accounts at HBMX, as well as an outstanding
loan. After the United States seized the companys [Pueblas] funds at
Wachovia Bank in May 2007, HBUS [in the US] suspended the Puebla account
two weeks later and closed the account in June 2007.
[However,] HBMX [in Mexico] did not actually
close the account until November 2007, and then only after the Mexican
Attorney General served an order on the bank seizing Puebla funds.
But the connections between Wachovia, the HSBC
subsidiaries and Puebla, run far deeper.
To understand the threads that connect these
financial players, it is necessary to revisit the mysterious crash of a
Gulfstream II corporate jet on Sept. 24, 2007, in Mexicos Yucatan region.
Onboard that jet was an estimated four tons of
cocaine, which appears to have been loaded onto the jet in Colombia.
The Gulfstream II sported a tail number,
N987SA, linked by
European investigators to past CIA rendition operations.
Narco News has previously reported that the
bill of sale for
the Gulfstream jet - which was sold only weeks before its crash landing -
lists an individual named
Greg Smith,
whose name also shows up in public documents that indicate he worked as a
pilot in the past for an covert operations involving the FBI, DEA and CIA
that targeted narco-traffickers in Colombia.
A
CIA asset named Baruch Vega, who was a key player in those
undercover operations, also
confirmed the information related to Smith. Narco News has, to date, not
been able to track down Smith, or his partner in the jet-acquisition deal,
Clyde OConnor, for comment.
Vega also claims that the cocaine load on the
jet was purchased through a syndicate of Colombian narco-traffickers that
included a professed CIA asset named Nelson Urrego, who was was arrested by
Panamanian authorities on money-laundering and drug-trafficking charges
authorities in 2007 a little more than a week prior to the crash of the
Gulfstream II jet.
The Gulfstream II jet,
according
to Mexican authorities, was among a number of aircraft acquired by the
Sinaloa drug organization via an elaborate money laundering scheme involving
a chain of Mexican casa de cambios (currency exchange houses).
Those
money-exchange houses, including Puebla (a customer of both Wachovia and the
HSBC subsidiaries), were overseen by alleged Sinaloa organization operative
Pedro Alfonso Alatorre Damy, according to
Mexican
government and
U.S. media reports.
Damy was arrested in Mexico in November 2007. He
also
is facing a series of charges in the U.S., including conspiracy to
import cocaine and conspiracy to launder money.
Vega told Narco News previously that, from what
he knows, the Gulfstream II jet was part of a legitimate law enforcement
operation designed to gather evidence against narco-traffickers shipping
contraband into the US.
However, other law enforcers and intelligence
assets who spoke with Narco News all agree that even a legitimate law
enforcement operation cannot be carried out overseas without the CIA lurking
in the background - given the CIAs broad mission as the primary foreign
intelligence agency charged with protecting interests deemed vital to the
U.S.
They conclude that it is possible the CIA-connected cocaine jet, which
crashed in Mexico in 2007, less than a year after Mexican President Felipe
Calderon declared war on the cartels, was part of a CIA covert operation.
The CIA Thing
A
criminal case now pending in Chicago, cloaked under the heavy blanket of
national security, offers some insight into one possible explanation for CIA
involvement in the Gulfstream II operation.
A high-level player with the Sinaloa cartel, one
of the most notorious narco-trafficking organizations in Mexico, claims that
the Sinaloa cartels leadership has been working with the U.S. government
for years, according to pleadings filed in his Chicago court case.
That player, Jesus Vicente Zambada Niebla, is
the son of Ismael El Mayo Zambada Garcia - one of the purported top
leaders of the Sinaloa drug-trafficking organization. Zambada Niebla was
arrested in Mexico in March 2009 and in February 2010 extradited to the
United States to stand trial on narco-trafficking-related charges.
The
indictment pending against Zambada Niebla claims he served as the
logistical coordinator for the cartel, helping to oversee an operation
that imported into the U.S.,
multi-ton quantities of cocaine
using
various means, including but not limited to, Boeing 747 cargo aircraft,
private aircraft
buses, rail cars, tractor trailers, and automobiles.
The revelation that Zambada Niebla claims to
have been a U.S. government asset, working with its sanction, is a shocking
development in the so-called drug war.
The claim, if true, adds credence to theories
long in play that the Mexican and US governments are essentially showing
favor toward the Sinaloa drug organization and its leadership, including El
Mayo and Joaquin El Chapo Guzman Lorea, as part of a broader strategy to
weaken and ultimately eliminate rival narco organizations. US and Mexican
government officials, of course, have consistently denied that any such
arrangement is in place.
But Zambada Nieblas allegations cant be
disregarded entirely, given the US government, specifically the CIA, does
have a track record of distorting the rule of law when it deems US national
interests are at stake.
McLean, Va.-based Riggs Bank was
acquired by PNC Financial Services Group in 2005 after entering a guilty
plea, and paying a $16 million fine, related to Justice Department charges
that it failed to report numerous suspicious transactions.
Among the
transactions Riggs failed to monitor properly involved those of the infamous
Chilean dictator and US ally Augusto Pinochet.
The 2005
DOJ
press release announcing Riggs guilty plea, a quite rare event in the
banking world, states the following:
Between 1994 and 2002, Pinochet and his
wife, Lucia Hiriart Rodriguez, maintained multiple bank accounts,
investments, and certificates of deposits at Riggs (the "Pinochet
Accounts").
The Pinochet Accounts were located at Riggs in the United
States and at its London branch. During this time period, Pinochet
deposited more than $10 million into the Pinochet Accounts.
However, Riggs failed to conduct sufficient
due diligence regarding the source of the funds being deposited into the
Pinochet Accounts and failed to report transactions it knew or had
reason to know were suspicious.
Additionally, Riggs personnel
transferred monies in a manner to avoid scrutiny.
So its clear that Riggs helped to facilitate
the movement of millions of dollars through the bank for the benefit of a
brutal South American dictator who just happened to be a US puppet.
What is
less well known are Riggs alleged ties to the CIA, as revealed in a 2004
Wall Street Journal report.
From that
WSJ
report:
(Riggs Bank) has had a longstanding
relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency, according to people
familiar with Riggs operations and U.S. government officials.
That relationship, which included top
current and former Riggs executives receiving U.S. government security
clearances, could complicate any prosecution of the bank's officials,
according to private lawyers and former prosecutors.
The Wall Street Journal article points out that
the US has had a,
longstanding but indirect relationship with Mr. Pinochet
and also alleges that from the 1990s through 2003, Riggs officials
allegedly hid some of Mr Pinochets dealings with the bank from regulators.
Now, to date, there is no evidence indicating
that McLean, Va.-based HBUS - or its London-based parent, HBSC, or its
Mexican affiliate, HBMX - have a relationship with the CIA.
However, it does
seem clear that the CIA played some role in the case of the Sinaloa
cartel-connected Puebla, via the Gulfstream II cocaine jet. And its clear
from the US Senate report that HBSCs subsidiaries moved a lot of suspect
money for Puebla.
And there is mounting evidence that US and
Mexican interests in the drug war in Mexico, under Mexican President
Calderons "war on the cartels," which has claimed some 120,000 lives in
Mexico since late 2006, have more to do with consolidating control of the
drug trade rather than eliminating it.
That war will now continue under the
reign of incoming Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, who has already made
some moves that hint at further consolidation efforts.
A recent development on that front involves a
letter sent to the El Paso Times and the Mexican publication Reforma by
a major narco-trafficker, now captured, Edgar Valdez Villareal, known as
La
Barbie, who at one time was the top enforcer for Mexicos Beltran Levya drug
organization - which has been locked in a long-running, bitter feud with the
Sinaloa organization.
La Barbie (above image), arrested by Mexican police in 2010
and now sitting in a Mexican prison awaiting extradition to the US, alleges
in his letter that Mexican President Calderon started negotiating with
Mexico's major cartels, seeking to broker deals, at least by 2008 - less
than two years after taking office.
La Barbie claims the person coordinating
the negotiations was former Mexican Interior Minister Juan Camilo Mouriño,
who died in a
fiery plane crash in November 2008.
Also of interest is that Sinaloa cartel leader
Zambada Niebla, in his court case in Chicago, contends that the Sinaloa
organizations top leaders have been cooperating for years under a
quid-pro-quo immunity deal struck with the US government - under which
the Sinaloa leadership, in return, has agreed to provide US law enforcers
with information on its rivals, such as the Beltran Levya gang, a contention
US prosecutors claim is false.
La Barbie says in his letter to the newspapers
that he did not go for the deal offered by Calderons representatives - and
for that reason, he suspects, he was hunted down by Mexican authorities.
But
is it possible - assuming the allegations in La Barbies letter are valid -
that other narco-trafficking groups did cut a deal with the Calderon
Administration, which resulted in them being afforded special treatment?
Mexican officials contend the charges made by La
Barbie in his letter are baseless, however.
And yet another piece of the puzzle involves a
Mexican diplomat - whose
emails with a private US-based intelligence firm,
Stratfor, were made
public earlier this year via WikiLeaks.
The Mexican diplomat, who was
stationed as recently as this year at the Mexican Consulate in Phoenix,
claims in his emails that the Mexican government has engaged in quid-pro-quo
deals with Mexicos cartels in an effort to maintain order in the nations
major drug plazas, such as Juarez.
That diplomat also contends in a July
2009 email that the,
"major cartels have
guaranteed routes into the US."
So as Calderon leaves office to go teach at
Harvard University in Massachusetts, after spending the last six years
ramping up the drug wars flow of blood and money, and as yet another series
of bank money-laundering cases linked to Mexican narco-traffickers gains the
attention of the media, it seems the specter of that drug war is taking on
the opaque hue of an elaborate pretense.
And of course this is all driven by money -
which might shed some light on why so many banks have essentially been given
a get-out-of-jail-free card when it comes to anti-money laundering laws -
and possibly, in some cases, even been encouraged to sidestep the law to
advance the covert interests of certain three-letter US agencies.
Narco News, at the turn of this century, made an
international splash by exposing an alleged narco-trafficker who also
happened to run a huge bank, laying a marker down on this problem and
risking its own existence to do so.
But still, more than a decade later, the
game continues, with the dots in plain sight still left unconnected by a
mainstream media seemingly blissfully ignorant of the history of this drug
war and content to cover its bloody, episodic battles.
In the end, in almost all cases, governments
don't arrest bankers or charge banks criminally. Rather, they cut deals with
them, assuring the status quo is maintained and vested moneyed interests are
protected.
This is not a 'conspiracy theory'; its simply a pragmatic
investment strategy.
And it should lead us to conclude, if we are
honest with ourselves, that the so-called drug war is little more than one
immense "drug deal."
