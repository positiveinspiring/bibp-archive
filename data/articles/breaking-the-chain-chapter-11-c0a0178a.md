Chapter Eleven
Suicidal Programming
I have decided to write an entire chapter about suicidal programming,
since it is often the most dangerous programming that the survivor will
face during their healing process. ALL ILLUMINATI SURVIVORS WILL HAVE
SUICIDAL PROGRAMMING PROTECTING THEIR SYSTEMS. I emphasized this to
also reiterate the need for good therapy and a strong support system
for the survivor.
The Illuminati know and realize that with time, individuals in their
group may start to question what they are doing. Or they may become
disenchanted with their role. They may even desire to leave the group
or try to dismantle their own programming.
The trainers are well aware of this possibility and to prevent this,
will always program in suicidality. The suicidality, or suicidal programming,
may surround one or more systems internally. It may be layered into
more than one system.
From earliest childhood, survivors have been conditioned to believe
that they would rather die than leave their "family" (the
Illuminati group). This is the core, or basis of suicidal programming.
It will be closely linked to loyalty to one's family as well as the
group (remember, this is a generational group and leaving it may mean
giving up contact with one's parents, spouse, siblings, aunts, uncles,
cousins and children, as well as close friends). These people will all
try to contact the survivor, and try to draw them back into the cult,
asking "don't you love us anymore?", or even becoming accusatory
and hostile if the survivor does not respond the way they wish. The
survivor will be told that they are "crazy". Or delusional.
That their family loves them and would never be part of a cult. The
family members will all still be amnesic, unless something happens to
trigger their own memories.
One of the most frequent suicidal programming sequences placed internally
will be "come back or die " programming. A family member may
activate it by telling the survivor that they are missed and their family
wants to see them. If the survivor fails to return, the programming
will start running. It can only be deactivated by a code word from the
person's trainer or cult contact person. This ensures that they will
recontact. If the survivor tries to break this programming, they will
need assistance, both internal and external, for safety.
Hospitalization may be needed in a safe facility that understands DID
and programming, as well as suicidality, as the alters inside will begin
fighting if the person tries to break the programming. They have been
programmed to commit suicide, or be shattered internally, or at the
very least, severely punished, and are afraid of the repercussions of
not obeying. The survivor will need to get to know these internal alters,
and reassure them that they no longer need to do their jobs.
Chronometric suicidal programming is another type placed within. This
does not need contact with family members to activate. In fact, it is
activated automatically after a certain amount of time WITHOUT cult
contact. Controller alters and/or punishing alters will have been programmed
that if a certain period of time goes without contact with the trainer,
they are to commit suicide. They will be told that the only way to prevent
this is recontact with the trainer, who knows a command code to halt
the program. The time interval may be anywhere from three months to
nine months, each system is different. Call back programming may have
this type of programming as a back up, to ensure that it is followed
through on.
Systems layered programming is a particularly complex form of suicide
programming where several systems (up to six at a time), are programmed
to fire off suicide programming simultaneously. This always needs hospitalization
for the survivor's safety.
Honor/dishonor programming is common in military systems. In this,
the military parts are told that an "honorable and courageous"
soldier will take his life, rather than reveal secrets or leave his
unit.
"No tell" programming will often be reinforced by suicidal
programming.
Access denied programming, which prevents unauthorized access both
externally and internally, will often be reinforced by either or both
suicidal/homicidal programming.
Almost all suicidal programming is put in place to either ensure continued
obedience to the cult's agenda; to ensure regular recontact; or prevent
the individual or an outside person from accessing the person's system
without authorization (i.e. the correct access codes, which the trainers
are careful to use at the beginning of each session). It will frequently
block therapy, as the survivor will be terrified, and rightly so, of
dying if they reveal their internal world, or disclose their history.
Suggestions
First, both the survivor and the therapist need to find out what suicide
programming is present (it's a safe bet it's there, no need to ask IF
it is present). Internal communication, and finding out which alters
or fragments hold suicide programming will be important. Physical safety,
whether with a safe outside person, or inpatient hospitalization, while
working on suicide programming is extremely important, as this programming
may either drive the survivor to self destructive behavior, or back
to the cult. Dealing with suicide programming assumes that the survivor
and therapist have initiated good system communication internally. This
is extremely important, since the survivor will need cooperation inside
with dismantling suicidality.
Letting alters inside know that they no longer have to do their job,
that they can change, may help. Reality orientation, letting them know
that if they kill the body, that they will die, may also help (many
times, these parts have been deceived into believing that they themselves
will not die, if they do their jobs. This means they need to hear the
truth). Having controller alters, high alters with pull inside the system,
agree to help the therapist dismantle the programming will help. But
be aware that SOME INTERNAL SUICIDE SEQUENCES WILL BE PUT IN THAT EVEN
CONTROLLERS CANNOT DISMANTLE. Creating a safety committee inside whose
main job is to keep the body safe and ask for help if suicidal programming
begins to kick in, BEFORE ACTING OUT OCCURS, will also help tremendously.
As the survivor develops trust with their therapist and realizes the
value of life, and that life can be much better than it has ever been
before, they will become more willing to reach out and ask for help
if they become suicidal. The survivor may also find that they encounter
core despair. This despair may have been used by the cult to run suicidal
programming, but it is not programming itself. A very young core split
may have taken many of the feelings of despair, hopelessness, failure
to thrive and desire to die, that the child felt growing up in a horribly
abusive atmosphere. This is not programming but true feelings, and it
will be important to differentiate this from programming. If core despair
comes up, the alter containing this may also report having been trained
to NOT SUICIDE, or give up. The trainers will do this, if despair begins
overwhelming the subject at an early age, to prevent the child's suicide.
The survivor's cognitives, helpers, nurturers, will all need to be
gathered together to help this part of the core heal. There will be
intense, and rightful, grieving and anguish for the immense pain that
the young child suffered. Hopelessness will come out. It can help if
alters with happier memories can try and share their memories with this
very young part. External support and caring can also make a big difference.
Healing the immense pain held by this core split will take a long period
of time and should not be hurried. Antidepressants can help, as the
depression may be shared through all systems. Messages of hope, new
and positive experiences can all help the survivor work through this
type of programming, as well as journaling, poetry, artwork and collaging
the feelings. Time, patience, support, the ability to vent feelings
in a safe manner and physical safety when needed, will all help immensely
as the survivor works through these issues.
