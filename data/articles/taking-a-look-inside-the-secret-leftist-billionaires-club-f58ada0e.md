FOUNDING FATHER:
Billionaire George Soros
wanted an answer
to George W. Bushs
presidential win
This weekend, a shadowy leftist group named
Democracy Alliance will meet in Chicago to
figure out a way to thwart conservative rivals.
As the adage goes, imitation is the most sincere
form of flattery.
While top liberal organizations blast the right
for accepting dark money, the Alliances entire business model is based on
maintaining secrecy akin to
the Illuminati.
"Like a lot of elite groups, we fly beneath
the radar," Oakland lawyer and Alliance donor Guy Saperstein
told the Washington Post in 2006, a
year after the group was formed.
"We are not so stupid though (to) deny our
existence."
The group requires some hefty financial backing.
It costs $25,000 just to join, yearly dues of $30,000 and an additional
$200,000 donation to Alliance causes.
Donation recipients must sign confidentiality
agreements, the Post reported.
The Alliance was founded by a group of
billionaires, including
George Soros and philanthropist
Peter B. Lewis, as a result of George W. Bushs re-election. Its goal
was to fund think tanks and media organizations to move societal change
toward a more socialist agenda.
But the focus changed to funding political
endeavors after Vice President Joe Biden asked for help in 2011 for
the upcoming election.
Obamas campaign and his umbrella activist group
Organizing for Action have received millions from Democracy
Alliance members. This caused Lewis to quit because the group had become
too partisan and wasnt concentrating on infrastructure,
according to media reports.
Lewis, who died last year, hasnt been the only
high-profile defector.
OBAMAS SUPPORT GROUP:
The Democracy Alliance seeks
to employ the presidents agenda
One Alliance member who owns a cell phone
company turned on
Obama last year over a scandal involving telephone
surveillance of ordinary American citizens.
CREDO Mobiles Michael Kieschnick
told CNN Money he was,
"deeply disturbed" at Obamas "growing
record of executive power grabs at the expense of constitutionally
guaranteed civil liberties."
Neither Kieschnick nor Democracy Alliance
responded to requests for comment.
The lefts biggest mouthpiece for bashing the
right over dark money and civil liberties issues has been the
Center for Media and
Democracy (CMD), also funded by Soros.
CMD has been at the forefront of
cheering on a
secret investigation into dozens of conservative organizations, led by a
Democrat district attorney.
The prosecutors theory, questioned
by the investigations own presiding judge, is that the groups illegally
coordinated with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walkers campaign during the states
Democrat-driven recall elections.
The investigation
issued more than
100 subpoenas last year to conservative individuals and organizations as
part of the probe, which, sources have told
Watchdog.org, included "paramilitary-style" pre-dawn raids at the homes
and offices of conservative targets.
CMD, however, was on a public crusade to unseat
Walker.
One target was the consumer-advocacy group Club
for Growth, which CMD claimed,
"was at the center of a tangled web of
undisclosed dark money in 2011, raking in millions from out-of-state
secret donors and shuffling it to other nonprofits that in turn spent
millions on the 2011 and 2012 elections."
When asked about CMDs own finances,
its director, Lisa Graves said,
"The question of conservative funders versus
liberal funders, I think, is a matter of false equivalency."
After Lewis left, the Alliance
apparently dropped groups that didnt agree with its new stance.
Favored
organizations that have remained include two Soros-funded groups: think tank
Center for American Progress and
Media Matters, a
self-appointed media police for,
"monitoring, analyzing and correcting
conservative misinformation."
Each year, the Alliance holds an annual meeting
where high-profile politicians and their donors meet to raise money and plan
a progressive agenda.
In keeping with its secrecy, the Alliances website
has no mention of its annual conference starting Sunday at the Ritz-Carlton
in Chicago.
But both Politico and the Chicago Tribune saw
agendas listing powerful
Clinton and Obama allies along with,
Besides focusing on mid-term and 2016 elections,
panel discussions will include issues such as climate change, income
inequality, abortion and the death penalty.
