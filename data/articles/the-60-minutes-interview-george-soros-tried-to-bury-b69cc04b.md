# The '60 Minutes' Interview George Soros Tried to Bury!

James Corbett covered an
interview from a 1998
60 Minutes interview with
George Soros
in a past episode of The Corbett Report; and up until very
recently, all the public had to go on was the leaked
transcript of that interview.
Yet today, and we do not know
for how long, that 1998 interview (below video) has resurfaced on YouTube
with some damning revelations.
From
Clinton and the Haitians,
and Soros' sordid past, to his current business dealing (at
that time) and how they have negatively affected the world.
He then goes on to state that he feels no guilt for the
massive repercussions of his dealings, despite entire
nations naming him as the catalyst to their financial
destruction, as he sees his dealings as amoral, and
therefore should not be associated with feelings of guilt
and responsibility.
Some may agree with his assessment, and many others may not,
yet the one thing that cannot be denied is that no one
person, whether or not they personally view their actions as
amoral and beyond reproach, should have the ability to do
such damage to a country and its people, regardless of how
they view their own work.
If any nation or individual had
such an effect on the US, even if that country or individual
felt their actions to be "amoral," they would certainly be
held accountable, or just "quietly" disposed of in typical
Obama-drone fashion.
What this ultimately implies, is
that if you are a third-world country with no means of
retaliation or rebuke, then these types of "amoral" business
dealings are completely acceptable by western standards.
Which is absolutely why these
types of financially devastating currency games will never
be played where a western-aligned country will take the hit
(until that is the plan), and that should speak volumes.
