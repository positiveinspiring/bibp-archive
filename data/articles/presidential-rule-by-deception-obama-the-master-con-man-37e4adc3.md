Barack Obama
Introduction
In an electoral system, run by and for a corporate oligarchy, deception and
demagoguery are essential elements - entertaining the people while working
for the wealthy.
Every US President has engaged, in one fashion or another, in play acting
to secure popular approval, neutralize hostility and distract voters from
the reactionary substance of their foreign and domestic policies.
Every substantive policy is accompanied by a down home folksy message to
win public approval.
This happened with,
-
President Jimmy Carters revival of
large-scale proxy wars in Afghanistan in the post-Viet Nam War
period
-
Ronald Reagans genocidal wars in
Central America
-
George Bush Sr.s savaging of Iraq in
the First Gulf War
-
Bill Clintons decimation of social
welfare in the US while bombing civilians in Yugoslavia and
deregulating Wall Street
-
George Bush Jr.s invasion and partition
of Iraq and Afghanistan, the attempted coup in Venezuela and massive
tax cuts for the rich
-
Barack Obamas staggering bailout of the
biggest Wall Street speculators, unprecedented launching of five
consecutive wars, and arrest and deportation of millions of
immigrant workers.
Each President has elaborated a style in order
to ingratiate himself with the public while pursuing his reactionary agenda.
In rhetoric, appearance and in public persona, it is de rigueur for US
Presidents to present themselves as an everyman while committing political
actions - including war crimes worthy of prosecution.
Each President, in his play acting, develops a style suitable to the
times. They constantly strive to overcome the publics suspicion and
potential hostility to their overt and covert policies designed to build
empire as domestic conditions deteriorate.
However, not all play acting is the same: each
Presidents populist style in defense of oligarchic interests has its
characteristic nuances.
The Carter Feint -
Human Rights Wars in the Post-Viet Nam War Era
Jimmy Carter was elected President at a time of the greatest
mass anti-war upheaval in US history.
His campaign projected a soft-spoken,
conciliatory President from humble roots reaching out to the anti-war
electorate and solemnly pledging to uphold human rights against domestic
militarists and their overseas despotic allies.
To that end, he appointed a liberal human rights
advocate Pat Derian to the State Department and a veteran Cold
Warrior,
Zbigniew (Zbig)
Brzezinski, as National
Security Advisor and foreign policy strategist.
Duplicity reared its head immediately: Carter openly criticized the
Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua - while privately telling the dictator
to ignore the public criticisms and assuring him of continuing US support.[1]
As the Sandinista revolution advanced toward
victory, Carter convoked a meeting of Latin American leaders urging them to
join in a joint military intervention with the US to save lives and to
prevent the popular Nicaraguan revolution from taking power and dismantling
the dictators army.
It soon became clear to the leaders of Latin
America that Carters mission was a thinly-veiled humanitarian version of
gunboat diplomacy and they declined.
When Carter realized that, without the fig leaf
of Latin American participation, a US-led invasion would arouse universal
opposition, he abandoned the project. The political climate would not
support a unilateral US invasion so soon after the end of the war in
Indochina.
However, Carter soon re-launched the Cold War, reviving military spending
and pouring billions of dollars into funding, arming and training tens of
thousands of fundamentalist Jihadists from around the world to invade
Afghanistan and overthrow its leftist, secular government.
Carters policy of re-militarization and launching of large-scale and
long-term secret CIA operations in alliance with the most brutal dictators
and monarchs of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan was accompanied by sanctimonious
speeches about human rights and token appeals to protect civilians. In
this regard,
Carter became our founding father of the double
discourse: a con man that publically condemned the jailing and torture by
Pinochet of political opponents in Chile while orchestrating what would
become a decade-long blood bath in Afghanistan with millions of victims.
Reagan - Geniality
with Genocide
Up until the ascendancy of Barack Obama, the avuncular President, Ronald
Reagan, was acknowledged as the master con-man, by virtue of his
Hollywood acting experience.
Reagan was and remained a disciplined and
hardened backer of policies designed to concentrate wealth while smashing
unions, even as he entertained the flag-waving hard hat construction workers
with his jokes about limousine liberals and Cadillac welfare queens.
The knowing wink and clever two-liners were
matched by an adaptation of morality tales from his cowboy films.
Reagan, in his role as the righteous sheriff,
backed the mercenary contras as they invaded Nicaragua and destroyed schools
and clinics and the genocidal military dictators in El Salvador and
Guatemala who murdered hundreds of thousands of Indians and peasants.
Uncle Reagans friendly chats would describe how he had stopped the
communist outlaws (peasants, workers and Indians) of Central America from
flooding across the Rio Grande and invading California and Texas.
His tales resonated with mass audiences familiar
with the racist Hollywood cowboy film version of unshaven Mexican bandits
crossing the US border.
The clean-shaven, straight-talking, stand-up
for America President Ronald Reagan was elected and re-elected by a
resounding majority in the midst of CIA-backed mujahedeen victories over the
government and secular civil structure of Afghanistan, Pentagon- supported
Israeli slaughter of Palestinian refugees in their camps in Lebanon and the
mass genocide of scores of thousands of indigenous villagers in Guatemala.
When news reports seeped out about the mass graves of poor villagers in
Guatemala, Reagan resorted to colloquial language right out of a Hollywood
film to defend General Rios Mont :
Hes getting a bum rap.
In defending the brutal dictator of Guatemala,
Reagan replaced Carters sanctimonious phrasing in favor of down-to-earth
macho talk of a no-nonsense sheriff.
In substance, both Carter and Reagan were rebuilding the US war machine
after the debacle of Viet Nam; they were setting up a global network of
client dictators, Muslim fundamentalists and hypocritical Anglo-American
humanitarians interventionists.
Bush Senior - Uni-Polarity
and the Ticket to Uncontested Imperial Conquests
Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, the US and Western Europe
re-conquered, pillaged and neo-colonized Eastern Europe.
West Germany annexed East Germany. And a
predator-gangster oligarchy in Russia seized over a trillion dollars of
public assets, impoverishing millions and laundered the illicit funds via
elaborate banking operations on Wall Street and in London and Tel Aviv.
President
George Bush Sr. embraced the doctrine
of a unipolar world - free from rival super-power constraints and
independent Third World resistance.
Poppy Bush believed the US could impose its
will by force anywhere and at any time without fear of retaliation.
He believed he was heir to a new imperial order
of free markets, free elections and unrestrained plunder. The first war he
would launch would be
in the Middle East - the invasion, massive
bombing and destruction of Iraq.
It was followed by an unprecedented expansion of
NATO bases in the countries of Eastern Europe. The spread of neo-liberalism
led to the naked pillage of public assets throughout Latin American and
Eastern Europe.
The Empire ruled the Muslim world through an arc
of client dictators from Tunisia, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia to Pakistan.
Bush adopted the persona of the happy warrior - the invincible American
President who had triumphed over the Evil Empire. Meanwhile, the domestic
economy deteriorated under the enormous costs of the massive military
build-up and gave rise to a crisis that hurt the electorate.
Bushs personal rigidity and lack of
theatricality prevented him from playing the con-man - unlike his
predecessor, the actor Reagan. Even as he extolled the prowess of the US
military, his career as an insider corporate operative and CIA director
did not provide him with the demagogic skills necessary for a successful
re-election.
While Bush celebrated his overseas victories, he failed to attract a popular
following: His pinched face and wooden upper-crust smile was no match for
Cowboy Reagans street corner geniality or even Jimmy Carters pious
intonations of human rights and Christian values
Deception and demagoguery are crucial elements
in a re-election campaign - and so Bush, Sr. gave way for the next
Presidential con-man-in-chief, Bill Clinton.
The Clinton-Con -
Black Churches, Welfare Cuts and the Wall Street Warrior
Bill
Clinton, like Ronald Reagan, turned out to be a Wall Street
populist.
With his folksy Arkansas intonations he preached
messages of hope in black churches while diligently applying the free-market
lessons he had learned from his Wall Street mentors.
Tooting the saxophone and oozing compassion,
Clinton told the poor that he could feel their pain, while inflicting
misery on single mothers forced to leave their children and take
minimum-wage jobs in order to retain any public assistance.
He joined hands with labor union bosses at Labor
Day festivities, while fast-tracking job-killing free-trade treaties (like
NAFTA) that devastated the American working class.
Bill Clinton enthusiastically sent bombers over
Belgrade and other Yugoslav cities for several weeks, destroying its
factories, hospitals, schools, power plants, radio and TV stations and
bridges, as well as the Chinese Embassy, in support of the terrorist Kosovo
Liberation Army and its separatist war against Belgrade.
Clinton bombed civilians and their vital
infrastructure, a war crime in the name of humanitarian intervention, to
the ecstatic cheers of many Western liberals, progressives, social democrats
and not a few Marxists as well as many Jihadists.
On the home front, this self-proclaimed
peoples candidate ripped to shreds all restraints on banking speculation
by repealing the
Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, New Deal
legislation enacted to protect against massive banking swindles.
This opened the floodgates to massive financial
manipulation, which destroyed the pensions of many millions of workers.[2]
Clintons policies laid the groundwork for the information technology and
Stock Market crash of 2000-01. His appointee, Alan Greenspan, created
the conditions leading to speculative financial frenzy and
subsequent economic crash of 2008.
Bill Clintons stand-up comic performances in
black churches, his back slapping encounters with labor bureaucrats and his
embrace of feminists and others just raised the rhetorical bar for future
aspiring Wall Street warlords in the White House.
It would take eight years and the election of
Barack Hussein Obama to finally surpass Bill Clinton as Con-Man-In Chief.
Bush Junior - A Yale
Man with a Texas Drawl
President
George Bush, Juniors regime launched
two major wars and backed two Israeli assaults on Palestinian civilians
trapped in Gaza - the worlds largest open-air prison.
He virtually eliminated taxes on billionaires
while overseeing the geometrical growth of the domestic police state
apparatus; and he unleashed the biggest speculative bubble and crash since
the Great Depression.
He lowered the living standards for all
Americans except the top 10% of the population - and despite these disasters
and despite his lack-luster performance as a con-man, he was re-elected.
His handlers and backers did their best to market their boy:
-
his Ivy League credentials and New
England background was replaced by a transparently phony Texas
accent
-
tinny, whiney sound bites, reminiscent
of his fathers, were replaced by a Texas ranchers homely drawl
His just-folks grammatical mistakes may have
been mocked by the liberals but they resonated deeply with fundamentalist
Christians - who would never have recognized the Phillips Exeter
Academy-Yale
Skull and Bones boy in their Commander-in
Chief.
President Bush, Jr. was decked out in the uniform of a Top Gun fighter
pilot to polish his military credentials tarnished by revelations that the
millionaire-playboy had gone AWOL during his service in the National Guard.
His silly Mission Accomplished claim that the
Iraq war had been won in the first months after the invasion was rudely
corrected by the huge outbreak of Iraqi resistance against the occupier.
Bush handed over foreign policymaking,
especially pertaining to the Middle East, to a small army of Jewish
Zionists, aided and abetted by notorious militarists, like Cheney and
Rumsfeld.
Most major political events were handled by his
Cabinet thugs - Secretary of State Colin Powell shamelessly
fabricated the evidence of Saddam Husseins weapons of mass destruction in
his performance before
the United Nations.
Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz
invented Afghanistans ties to
the
planners of 9/11.
Cheney and his Zionist troika of,
-
Paul Wolfowitz
-
Douglas Feith
-
Scooter Libby,
...trumpeted the global
war on terror while,
-
Michael Chertoff
-
Michael Mukasey
-
Stuart Levey,
...conducted a domestic war against the Bill of
Rights and US Constitutional freedoms, defending torture, jailing thousands
of Muslims, punishing businesses trading with Iran and labeling US opponents
of Israels war crimes as security threats.
Bush, Jr. just nodded his approval, letting the
big fellas have a piece of the action.
With Junior, there was no peace demagoguery just
plain talk to plain folks and,
Let the bombs fall and the Capital flow.
Bush did not have to go preaching to black
churches (he had a black Secretary of State and National Security Adviser to
do his dirty work without the cant); Bush never claimed that Israel got the
bum rap when it was charged with genocidal crimes.
Under Bush, Jr., war criminals did not have to
sugar-coat their crimes. While occupying the White House, Bush signed off
on the multi-trillion-dollar bailout for Wall Street and then just went off
to tend his cows and chop wood at the Texas ranch.
Bushs style was a combination of laid back and straight forward: he
simply
committed war crimes, protected Wall Street
swindles and
expanded the police state, without claiming
otherwise.
As the endless wars dragged on, as the stock
market flopped under its own fraud and manipulation and the increasingly
repressive legislation provoked debate, Bush just shrugged his shoulders and
finished out his term in office without flourish or fanfare:
Yall cant win em all. Let the next guy
try his hand.
Barack Obama - The Master of
Deceit
From the beginning of his Presidential campaign,
Obama
demonstrated his proficiency as the master of all cons.
He spoke passionately against torture while
consulting with the torturers; he condemned Wall Street speculators while
appointing key Street operatives as economic advisers.
He promised a new deal in the Middle East,
especially for Palestinians and then appointed a dual citizen, Israeli-US,
Rahm Emmanuel (son of an Israeli Irgun terrorist) to be his most
intimate Presidential advisor.
Honolulu born and bred, Barack modulated his
voice according to the audience, adopting a Baptist ministers cadence for
the black audiences while assuming the professorial tone of an Ivy League
lawyer for his Wall Street contributors.
He hob-knobbed with Hollywood celebrities and Silicon billionaires, who
bankrolled the fairy tale of his historic breakthrough - the First
Afro-American President who would speak for all Americans - nay for the
entire world! Millions of giddy camp followers, white, black, old and young,
the trade unionists and community activists alike were willingly deceived.
They had chosen to disregard the fact that
Barack Obamas key advisers were rabid militarists, big bankers, corporate
CEOs, die-hard Zionists and Wall Street manipulators.
Indeed Obamas supporters were enchanted by the phony rhetoric, the
demagogy, the populist style, and the fake authenticities.
Here was the man who promised to end the wars,
close the torture concentration camp in Guantanamo, bring Wall Street to
heel, repeal the Patriot Act and restore the Bill of Rights.
And he was their guy - shooting hoops in an
urban playground - something Bush had never done! In truth, Barack Hussein
Obama did a lot that Bush never dared to do - he surpassed Bush by far in
committing war crimes against humanity - pushing for more military
adventures abroad and police state repression at home.
He exceeded by far any President in US history
in assuming dictatorial police powers, in waging multiple wars while
directing the massive transfer of state revenues to Wall Street bankers.
President Obama, hands down, will be regarded as
the greatest con-man President in American history.
The Carters, Reagans and Clintons all pale in
comparison:
the enormous gap between style and
substance, promise and performance, peace and war, capital and labor has
never been greater.
It is President Obamas hollow eloquence that
raised the hopes of millions at home and abroad only to condemn them to an
inferno of endless wars.
It is the perversity of his rhetoric which
attracts the Latino vote with promises of immigrant citizenship while his
policy has been fill detention centers with hundreds of thousands of
immigrant workers and their families.
His soaring rhetoric promising justice for
Muslims in Cairo was followed by the bloody bombing of Tripoli, the torture
and slaughter of the Libyan patriot President Kaddafi; the broken promises
to the Palestinians contrasts with the embrace of the bloody Israeli
warlords.
Obama far out-paced President Bushs drone attacks in Pakistan, Yemen and
Afghanistan, bombings which targeted farmers, whole families and famished
orphans in their schools.
Soaring moral and ethical pronouncements
accompany Obamas arming and praising the 40,000 Muslim fundamentalist
mercenaries sent to degrade and shatter the secular Syrian state.
The pretexts for mass killing fall from his lips
like maggots on a rotten corpse:
-
his blatant lies about the use of poison
gas in Syria as the government in Damascus confronts a foreign
mercenary invasion
-
the lurid tales of fabricated massacres
in Benghazi (Libya)
-
the false claims of stolen elections in
Venezuela
Obamas rhetoric converts executioners into
victims and victims into executioners.
President Barack Obama promised a comprehensive health care overhaul for
America and then presented the electorate with a confusing series of
obligatory payments for plans designed by for-profit private health
insurance companies.
Obama defended social security by raising the
age of retirement, ensuring that hundreds of thousands of workers in
hazardous occupations would die before ever receiving any benefits after a
lifetime of obligatory contributions.
Obama solemnly promised to defend Medicare and
then proposed to reduce its budget by a trillion dollars over a decade.
Obama claims a presidential prerogative of defending American interests by
ordering the assassination of whomever his million-member secret police
state apparatus designates as a security threat - including American
citizens - without trial, without recourse to habeas corpus.
In the White House Rose Garden President Barack Obama strolls arm-in-arm
with his wife and children, a family man, true to his promises
While in
Aleppo a young teen, a street vendor, is beheaded before his parents and
neighbors by fanatical freedom-fighters praised and supported by the
President.
The boys alleged crime was blasphemy.
The murdered teen has joined the scores of
thousands of Syrians killed and the hundreds of thousands who will join
them, as Obama has decided to openly arm the mercenaries.
Casual, open collar, President Obama jokes as he walks and talks with
Chinese President Xi Jinping at the sumptuous estate of a California
billionaire, offering friendship and peace - shaking hands for the cameras
with a scorpion in his palm. The smiling Obama has ceaselessly dispatched
his envoys to Asia, Latin America, Oceana and Africa to incite claims and
conflicts against Beijing.
Obama believes that his own personal magic
will blind the Chinese to the fact that China is being encircled by US air
and maritime bases. He seems to believe that the Chinese will ignore his
efforts to forge US-centered trade pacts which specifically exclude China.
The master confidence-man sincerely believes in his power to move and
mystify the public, pick the pockets of his adversaries and make his victims
believe they have been in the presence of a world-class statesman.
In fact, Obama has been playing the role of a
street hustler living off the earnings and lives of his people while handing
them over to his corporate bosses and pimps for Israel.
Obama fills internment camps with hundreds of thousands of Latino immigrant
workers while promising a roadmap to citizenship to the cheers of
Mexican-American Democratic Party vote hustlers!
Obama received 95% of the Afro-American votes, while the income gap between
blacks and whites widens and unemployment and poverty figures soar.
Obama, the first Afro-American President, has
bombed and intervened in more African countries, backing mercenary armies in
Libya and Somalia and establishing more military bases throughout the black
continent than the last five white Presidents
So much for the self-proclaimed historic
breakthrough of a Black President ending centuries of racism.
Its enough for Obama to appoint other black police state thugs and foreign
interventionists, like Eric Holder and Susan Rice, to win the cheers of
liberals even as their own security files grow in the data warehouses of the
worlds biggest spying agencies.
One cynic, commenting on the long-standing love affair between Obama and
white liberals, observed that,
the more he screws them the better they
like him
Even as he marches them off to jail, they would take care to
note on his behalf, that the barred windows have curtains - something
Bush would never have allowed.
Conclusion
For sheer span of broken promises, of systematic lies in pursuit of wars and
financial manipulation in the name of peace and social justice, of
consistent and bold aggrandizement of executive power over the life and
death of US citizens in the name of security, Obama has set the standard
of political deception and demagogy far beyond past and probable
future US Presidents.
The political context of his ascent to power and his deep links to the
military-financial-Zionist networks insured his success as a premier
confidence man.
President George Bush, Jr., the cringing, fading war-monger engaged in
prolonged, costly wars and facing the collapse of the entire banking and
financial sector, provided Candidate Obama with an easy target.
Obama exploited the mass revulsion of the
American people, longing for change.
His soaring rhetoric and vacuous promise of
change attracted millions of young activists
The problem is that in their
enthusiasm and blind adherence to identity politics with its claims that
all blacks and women are oppressed and therefore guaranteed to promote
peace and justice - facilitated Obamas con-game and political hustle.
Obama, once in office, not only deepened and widened the scope of President
Bush, Jrs wars, massive spy apparatus and corporate profiteering; he
bamboozled the vast majority of his liberal-labor supporters in the
Democratic Party!
Barack Obama conned the Democratic Party
Congressional liberals and they, in turn, conned their constituents into
supporting this fraud.
The costs of President Obamas two-faced policies are enormous: democracy
has given way to a police state openly defended by the President and
Congressional leaders; Wall Streets recovery and corporate profiteering is
fast destroying public health and social security.
Barack Obamas multiple endless wars and
interventions are destroying vast cities, infrastructure, entire cultures
while and killing and impoverishing millions of people from Libya to
Palestine, from Syria to Iran.
The economic sanctions against Iran, the
provocative encirclement and isolation of China, and the campaign to
destabilize Venezuela are the centerpieces of Obamas pivot to empire.
These policies portend even greater world-shattering catastrophes.
Unmasking the con-man is a first step requiring that we expose the tricks of
the con-game.
The politics of deception and demagogy thrives
by directing popular attention to style and rhetoric, not substance. The
solemn and pious cant of Jimmy Carter distracted from his launch of the
rabid Jihadists against the secular administration of Afghanistan. Uncle
Ronald Reagans geniality and populist TV patter covered-up his blood baths
in Central America and mass firing of the unionized air controllers and
jailing of union leaders.
Bill Clintons show of empathy for the poor
and embrace of feel-good politics neutralized opposition as he bombed
Yugoslavia into a pre-industrial age while his domestic policies kicked
vulnerable single mothers from welfare programs.
They all paled before the grand con-master
Obama, billed as the first black President, a community organizer (who
disowned his sponsor into the black communities of Chicago, Rev. Wright, for
his anti-war, anti-imperial stand) has capitalized on his racial credentials
to garner the vote of guilty-ridden, soft-headed liberals and marginalized
blacks in order to serve the interests of Wall Street and Israel.
Disarming these con-men and women requires exposing the nature of their
demagogic populist styles and focusing on substantive politics.
The decisive criteria need to be class politics
that are defined by fundamental class alignments, between capital and labor
regarding budgets, income, taxes, social spending, financing and property
rights.
Shooting hoops in ghetto playgrounds is a
con-mans distraction while his budget cuts close hospitals and schools in
black and poor neighborhoods.
The extravaganzas, featuring sports and entertainment celebrities to promote
imperial wars, are the con to undermine international solidarity for war
victims and the unemployed. President Obama, the confidence man, is still
performing while sowing destruction.
Its time for the deceived, the disillusioned and the deprived to stand-up
and shout!
We are deceived no more. Its time you were
put on trial for Crimes against Humanity!
