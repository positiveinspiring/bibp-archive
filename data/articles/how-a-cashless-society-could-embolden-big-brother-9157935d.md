# How a Cashless Society Could Embolden Big Brother

At the time, the need for consumer
protection was painfully obvious, but payday lending was and is
still legal. So the DOJ got creative, and asked banks and
payment processors to comply with government policies, and
proactively police "high-risk" activity.
Banks were asked to
voluntarily shut down the kinds of merchant activities that
government bureaucrats described as suspicious.
The price of
resistance was an active investigation by the Department of Justice.
By December 2013, the DOJ had issued fifty subpoenas to banks and
payment processors.
The most vociferous objections to
Operation Choke Point came from gun-rights activists, as the
firearms and ammunitions industry were labeled "high-risk." But guns
were only one industry among a bizarre miscellany that had been
targeted.
Tobacco sales, telemarketing, pornography, escort
services, dating services, online gambling, coin dealers, cable-box
descramblers, and "racist materials" were all explicitly listed on
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) website as,
"merchant categories that have been associated with high-risk
activity."
Critics of Operation Choke Point
saw the initiative as a policing of vice, rather than a consumer
protection campaign.
Many of the targeted industries - like
pornography - could be seen as morally unsavory. And in many cases -
as with guns - such moral judgments were highly politicized.
One pundit
wrote,
"[W]hile abortion clinics and environmental
groups are probably safe under the Obama administration, if this
sort of thing stands, they will be vulnerable to the same tactics if
a different administration adopts this same thuggish approach toward
the businesses that it dislikes."
For many conservatives, Operation Choke
Point was a new liberal offensive in the culture war, a
backhanded attack on the Second Amendment.
There was never any
evidence that guns were the primary focus of Operation Choke Point,
but the outrage continued, fueled by an alarming number of stories
of firearms vendors being cut off by credit-card companies or
suddenly having their bank accounts closed.
Similarly, porn performers began to
report being cut off from the financial system in similar ways, with
Chase shutting down the personal bank accounts of "hundreds of adult
entertainers" in the spring of 2014.
But the troubling effects
of Operation Choke Point wouldn't stop there.
* * *
Eden Alexander fell ill in the spring of
2014. It started when she suffered a severe allergic reaction to a
prescribed medication.
Then by her account, when she sought medical attention, the care
providers declined to treat her, assuming that the problem was
illegal drug use.
Alexander is a porn actress. According
to her, she was profiled and discriminated against, and failed to
receive due medical care. In the end, she developed a staph
infection.
She couldn't work, and she struggled to take care of
herself, let alone her medical bills, her apartment, her rent, her
dogs.
Her friends and supporters - many of
whom were also in the adult entertainment industry - started a
crowd-funding campaign on the
GiveForward platform, hoping to cover
her medical expenses.
She had raised over a thousand dollars when
the campaign was shut down and the payments were frozen.
GiveForward said that her campaign had
violated the terms of service of their payment processor,
WePay:
"WePay's terms state that you will
not accept payments or use the Service in connection with
pornographic items."
A few hours after Alexander received the
notice via email, and posted about it on Twitter,
she had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance.
At various points in the chain,
all transactions squeeze
through bottlenecks
created by big players
like Visa, Mastercard, and
Paypal.
The initial reaction on social media was
to assume that Alexander had, again, been discriminated against, and
that the campaign had been shut down because of the stigma of her
occupation.
It turned out, however, that one of her supporters had
offered to exchange nude pictures for donations to Alexander's fund,
on Twitter.
(Of course, this only raises the question of how WePay
had discovered the tweet, and whether they were in the habit of
policing the Twitter conversations around all of the crowd-funding
campaigns they were servicing.)
The suspension of payments to Eden
Alexander frustrated her well-wishers and supporters.
How could it
be so difficult to send Alexander a small amount of money? We live
in a world of abundant crowd-funding platforms, and every year brings
a fresh crop of money transfer smartphone apps. In the cashless
society, payments are supposed to flow more freely and easily than
ever.
Of course, the abundance of
forward-facing services and apps conceals the infrastructure that
made Operation Choke Point possible in the first place. Transactions
route through several tangled layers of vendors, processors, and
banks.
At various points in the chain, all transactions squeeze
through bottlenecks created by big players like Visa, Mastercard,
and Paypal: These are the choke points for which Operation Choke
Point is named.
The choke points are private
corporations that are not only subject to government regulation on
the books, but have shown a disturbing willingness to bend to
extralegal requests - whether it is enforcing financial blockades
against the controversial
whistleblowing organization WikiLeaks or
the
website Backpage, which hosts classified ads by sex workers, and
allegedly ads from sex traffickers as well.
A little bit of
pressure, and the whole financial system closes off to the
government's latest pariah. Operation Choke Point exploited this
tendency on a wide scale.
It's probably fair to say that the
federal government never targeted Eden Alexander, and that her
hospitalization was not a foreseeable consequence of that bare list
of bullet points put out by the FDIC - the list that threw
"Pornography" next to "Debt Consolidation Scams" and "Get Rich
Products."
mmmm
But subsequent statements made by WePay
sketch out a cause-effect relationship between Operation Choke Point
and the shutdown of Alexander's crowd-funding campaigning, revealing
how powerful the ripple effects of such initiatives could be.
"WePay faces tremendous scrutiny
from its partners & card networks around the enforcement of
policy, especially when it comes to adult content," a
representative
wrote in a blog post.
"We must enforce these policies or
we face hefty fines or the risk of shutdown for the many
hundreds of thousands of merchants on our service. We're
incredibly sorry that these policies added to the difficulties
that Eden is facing."
Where paternalism is bluntly enforced
through a bureaucratic game of telephone, unpleasant or even
inhumane unintended consequences are bound to result.
Looking at the
FDIC bullet point list of "high-risk" industries, it's strange to
see a list of a handful of actually-illegal activities (e.g.,
"scams" and "Ponzi schemes") alongside legal vices - gambling,
tobacco sales, and pornography.
The Electronic Benefit Transfer system
is largely benign, and indeed it is a step towards offering banking
for the "unbanked" - and that in itself could be a great benefit for
a segment of the population that currently must rely on
payday loans and check cashing operations.
However, it is part
of a larger trend, pushing us closer to a world where the cashless
society offers the government entirely new forms of coercion,
surveillance, and censorship.
A cashless society promises a
world
of limitation, control, and
surveillance,
which the poorest Americans
already have in abundance
EBT nudged society's most vulnerable
closer towards the cashless society.
Operation Choke Point used the
affordances of the cashless society to enforce what
its proponents saw as a consumer protection scheme, and what its
critics saw as a campaign against vice.
Choke Point rippled out
across society - by assessing certain industries as "high-risk," the
FDIC pressured the financial industry into policing and punishing
legal activities.
Eventually this effect trickled down to WePay,
which concluded it had to cut Eden Alexander off from her
fundraiser.
Alexander's ordeal was made possible by
our march towards the seemingly inevitable cashless society. Where
electronic payments reign supreme, the choke points become more
important than ever.
Cash has not always been with us - indeed,
credit systems predate the use of gold and silver as money.
But
it is fair to say that we are seeing an unprecedented future in
which the totality of financial activity is captured within the same
informational system, one that can be both monitored and influenced
by a powerful and sprawling administrative state.
The cashless society makes it more
possible for the vulnerable to experience Eden Alexander's ordeal.
On the face of it, it's bizarre that a consumer protection scheme
resulted in what Alexander suffered. But consumer protection and
anti-vice run along in the same vein: It is all paternalism, and in
particular, paternal regulation of the poor.
And when it comes to anti-vice in
particular, the poor suffer the most - they are held to a higher
moral standard than others, and are policed and punished for
straying from it. Welfare recipients must undergo invasive and
time-consuming drug testing.
Women (often women of color) walking in
areas "known for prostitution" are hassled or even arrested for
simply carrying condoms in their purse.
A cashless society promises a world of
limitation, control, and surveillance - all of
which the poorest Americans already have in abundance, of
course.
For the most vulnerable, the cashless society offers nothing
substantively new, it only extends the reach of the existing
paternal bureaucratic state.
* * *
The poor may be disparately impacted,
but the cashless society affects everyone.
And so relatively privileged
technolibertarians have long feared the cashless society, seeing it
as an electronic Panopticon, one of a host of privacy erosions
introduced by the digital age.
This fear has motivated a number of
innovations, from David Chaum's ecash (described in his 1985 paper "Security
without identification - Transaction systems to make big brother
obsolete"), to the much-hyped Bitcoin protocol.
Cryptocurrency isn't really a
federal priority,
and as long as that's the case,
it can be a viable backchannel
when payment processors
institute blockades.
Chaum focused on circumventing the
surveillance-capabilities of digital cash.
Bitcoin's pseudonymous
creator (or creators) Satoshi Nakamoto focused on eliminating the
ability of trusted third parties to prevent or reverse transactions
- the very capability that allows the kind of financial censorship
encouraged by Operation Choke Point.
These cryptocurrencies are
attempts to create vents and pockets of freedom inside the future
cashless world.
Their success has been, at best,
dubious. I needn't tell you about the viability of ecash. If you've
heard of it, you already know; if you haven't, that tells you
everything already.
As for bitcoin, while it has certainly seen
greater adoption, the digital currency has been hit with increasing
regulation, concentrated on the bitcoin exchanges which trade
government currency for bitcoin.
This regulatory trend has recreated
the very same bottlenecks and choke points that Satoshi Nakamoto
sought to circumvent in the first place.
But cryptocurrency isn't really a
federal priority, and as long as that's the case, it can be a viable
backchannel when payment processors institute blockades. Payment
processors stopped serving WikiLeaks in the wake of Cablegate;
eventually the organization was funded
mostly through bitcoin.
And when Visa and Mastercard stopped
serving Backpage in 2015,
sex workers also turned to bitcoin.

In June 2015, Thomas Dart, the sheriff
of Cook County - the largest county in Illinois, which includes the
city of Chicago - wrote an open letter to the major payment
processors.
"As the Sheriff of Cook County, a father and a caring
citizen, I write to request that your institution immediately cease
and desist from allowing your credit cards to be used to place ads
on websites like Backpage.com."
Backpage is a website that hosts
classified ads, including ads from escorts.
It is so prominent it
has been called "America's
largest escort site."
According to several anti-sex-trafficking
organizations, it is also a haven for
sexual slavery.
Some sex workers say, however, that if they
themselves are prevented from advertising,
they are put in harm's way.
"[H]aving the ability to advertise
online allows sex workers to more carefully screen potential
customers and work indoors," writes
Alison Bass.
"Research shows that when sex workers can't
advertise online and screen clients, they are often forced onto the
street, where it is more difficult to screen out violent clients and
negotiate safe sex (i.e. sex with condoms).
They are also more
likely to have to depend on exploitative pimps to find customers for
them."
The nuances of this debate were never
argued in a legislature or even a court of law.
Visa and Mastercard
immediately folded in the face of Dart's letter, and stopped serving
Backpage, making it nearly impossible for sex workers (and allegedly
traffickers as well) to advertise.
Financial censorship
could become pervasive,
unbarred
by any meaningful legal rights
or guarantees.
Dart's open letter resembled Operation
Choke Point, in a far flimsier yet more menacing fashion.
If Dart
had brought a legal action against Backpage, he would have no doubt
been trounced in court. The sheriff had already
lost a lawsuit against Craigslist in 2009 over their erotic
services ads. Although Dart clearly identified himself as the
Sheriff of Cook County, he never actually said he was actually going
to enforce any law against Visa, Mastercard, or even Backpage.
The letter made reference to the federal
anti-money-laundering statute and to the alleged existence of
sex-trafficking on the website, but it was in essence a missive
composed to elicit fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
As with Operation
Choke Point, it was a request for voluntary action, rather than a
criminal complaint, indictment, or injunction.
Perhaps if Visa or Mastercard had put up
a fight, Dart would have followed through on his veiled threats, the
way the Department of Justice issued subpoenas to errant banks and
processors. But because the two companies capitulated instantly,
there's no way of knowing.
In December 2015, a federal appeals
court in Illinois granted Backpage an injunction against Dart.
The
opinion, written by the esteemed Richard Posner, ripped into Dart
for trying to,
"shut down an avenue of expression of ideas and
opinions through 'actual or threatened imposition of government
power or sanction'" in violation of the First Amendment.
In court, Visa claimed that,
"at no point
did Visa perceive Sheriff Dart to be threatening Visa,"
...and that it
had simply made a voluntary choice to stop servicing Backpage.
But
back in June, Dart's director of communications had sent an email
informing Visa that the Sheriff's office was about to hold a press
conference on Backpage and sex trafficking, and that,
"[o]bviously
the tone of the press conference will change considerably if your
executives see fit to sever ties with Backpage and its imitators."
Internal emails between Visa employees at the time referred to the
Dart press conference email as "blackmail."
For Judge Posner, Dart's tactics were
troubling.
They could be easily replicated, following a formula of,
"unauthorized, unregulated, foolproof, lawless government coercion... coupling threats with denunciations of the activity that the
official wants stamped out, for the target of the denunciation will
be reluctant to acknowledge that he is submitting to threats but
will instead ascribe his abandonment of the activity to his having
discovered that it offends his moral principles."
Posner made no mention of it in his
opinion, but the same strategy had been repeated years earlier, when
Senator Joseph Lieberman had convinced the payment processors to cut
off WikiLeaks in the wake of the publication of the State Department
diplomatic cables.
As with Backpage, and was with Operation
Chokepoint, this was a "voluntary" decision on their part. The
financial blockade would only be lifted (partially) two years later
in 2013.
The Seventh Circuit Backpage
decision is an important First Amendment precedent, a much-needed
corrective in an age of ever-more-frequent financial blockading.
But
much of the decision builds its case by pointing to Sherriff Dart's hamfisted tactics, the obvious coercion that Visa employees called
"blackmail" in writing.
What happens to a more factually subtle case
that lands in front of a
less-libertarian-leaning judge?
As paper money evaporates from our
pockets and the whole country - even world - becomes enveloped by
the cashless society, financial censorship could become pervasive,
unbarred by any meaningful legal rights or guarantees.

In January 2011, shortly after
the WikiLeaks financial blockade was put into place, the founder
of WePay posted an
Ask Me Anything on Reddit, calling his company the "anti-Paypal."
He wrote that he was particularly
concerned with how readily PayPal froze accounts that collected
money for good causes. It had only been a month or two since
payment processors - including PayPal - had chosen to blockade
WikiLeaks.
So predictably, one commenter asked a
direct question about WikiLeaks.
"Theoretically, you can use WePay to
collect money from people in your social circles, and donate
that money to whomever you'd like," he wrote in response.
"That being said, we've
intentionally tried to keep our heads down and sit on the
sidelines for this one
[W]e pride ourselves on not freezing
accounts, but in extreme cases like wikileaks, there is always
the chance that authorities will force us to do so."
Four years later, the company seemed to
have decided that a fundraiser for a sex worker's hospital bills was
an extreme case like WikiLeaks.
