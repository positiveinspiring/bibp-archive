Your cell phone company knows everywhere you go,
twenty-four hours a day, every day.
How concrete is this fact for you?
It's very concrete for
Malte Spitz, a German politician and privacy advocate. He
used German privacy law - which, like the law of many European countries,
gives individuals a right to see what private companies know about them - to
force his cell phone carrier to reveal what it knew about him.
The result? 35,831 different facts about his
cell phone use over the course of six months.
As the German newspaper website Zeit Online
reports:
This profile reveals when Spitz walked down
the street, when he took a train, when he was in an airplane. It shows
where he was in the cities he visited. It shows when he worked and when
he slept, when he could be reached by phone and when was unavailable.
It shows when he preferred to talk on his
phone and when he preferred to send a text message. It shows which beer
gardens he liked to visit in his free time. All in all, it reveals an
entire life.
To show just how extensive this data is, Spitz
chose to make it all available to the public.
Zeit Online used it to prepare a remarkable
interactive map, which animates Spitz's
movements, moment by moment, over the course of half a year. It's correlated
with information Spitz willingly posted on the web, and, according to him
and the newspaper, is remarkably, eerily accurate. Try it out.
A report in the New York Times on Saturday
described the data release, which it called "astounding", and put it in a
U.S. context, quoting EFF's Kevin Bankston.
The Times tried to find out whether U.S. mobile
phone carriers have similar data about their subscribers, but it said,
"[t]he major American cell-phone providers
declined to explain what exactly they collect and what they use it for."
EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) has
been following this issue for years and has worked extensively to
limit government access to location data
about individuals.
Government agents have increasingly sought to
use this information, using questionable legal arguments to get carriers to
turn it over. Still, it's remarkable to see an actual location data set
about a real person.
(According to the Times, German carriers have,
for legal reasons, now stopped routinely storing this data. However, like
all mobile phone carriers, they still have the technical ability to
collect it at any time.)
Malte Spitz
explains why he worked to obtain this
information:
to help educate the public about some of
what's at stake in the German and worldwide debates about
telecommunications data retention. All around the world, including the
United States, proposed laws would force carriers to retain enormous
quantities of personal information.
As Spitz and Zeit Online have shown, these
troves of information can give a detailed picture of each person's private
life.
