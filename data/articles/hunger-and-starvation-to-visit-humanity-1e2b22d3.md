Do you believe that you will always be able to buy inexpensive food at the
supermarket? If so, you might want to think again.
During 2010, agricultural
commodity prices have exploded. Nearly every single important agricultural
commodity is experiencing double-digit percentage price increases.
The
S&P GSCI Agriculture Index recently surged to a fresh two-year high and now we
find that food producers and retailers are starting to pass those commodity
price increases on to consumers.
Food inflation is real; it is here and its going to hurt a lot of people.
In fact, food inflation is hitting consumers hard all over the globe this
fall. According to the United Nations, international wheat prices
have
soared 60 to 80 percent since July. Since the beginning of 2010, the price
of bread has gone up
17 percent and the price of meat has gone up 15 percent
in European Union countries.
The inflation rate in Russia
rose to 7 percent
in September primarily because of rising food costs.
The New York Times
reported,
First it was heat and drought in Russia. Then
it was heat and too much rain in parts of the American Corn Belt. Extreme
weather this year has sent grain prices soaring, jolting commodities
markets, and setting off fears of tight supplies that could eventually hit
consumers wallets.
Grain prices started to shoot up over the summer on
reports of a catastrophic drought in the major wheat-producing regions of
Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Prices rose not only for wheat, but also
for corn and soybeans, since those grains are interchangeable as animal feed
and a drop in wheat production could mean increased demand for the other
grains.
Corn prices surged again last week after a new report from the
United States
Agriculture Department
said this years corn crop would be smaller than
expected.
The harvest is forecast to be 3 percent lower than the 2009 crop.
In Canada
prairie farmers have faced near impossible planting conditions
this year. In Saskatoon, for example, 290 mm of rain fell throughout the
summer. The average rainfall amount is 184 mm. Both Regina and Winnipeg also
saw above average rainfall amounts, which left fields too saturated to get
into.
If the wet and soggy conditions werent already bad enough, an early
frost gave farmers yet another barrier to contend with. The cooler
temperatures not only lead to a loss in crop yield, it also limits the time
spent in the field for production.
Fresno County in California ranks first in the U.S. in
agricultural sales
every year.
Drive around it today, however, and youll
think you are in a desert. The tap has been turned off and area farmers
are not receiving their promised allotments. The locals call it a
'Congress-created Dust Bowl.'
The
San Joaquin Valley suffers a 15 percent rate of unemployment while
unemployment in water-deprived communities soars to 36 percent. The
unemployment rate in Fresno County notches 40 percent. Farmers, local
governments, small businesses and unemployed workers all cite the shortage
of water as the predominant factor.
According to a May 2009 study conducted
by the University of California-Davis, more than 35,000 jobs and billions in
economic revenue have been lost as a result of the manmade drought. Since
then, those numbers have continued to climb.
In Korea, over the past 12 months, the price of cabbage
- the main ingredient
in
kimchi, the countrys national dish - has risen over 400% to 11,500 won
($10) from 4,000 won two weeks ago and 2,500 won a month ago.
This is the
first time that cabbage prices have gone up so much, Park Young-koo,
researcher at the Korea Rural Economic Institute, told the Wall Street
Journal.
Since we have monitored the price, nothing like this has happened
before.
In a recent article entitled An Inflationary Cocktail In The Making,
Richard Benson listed many of the other agricultural commodities that have
spiked in price in 2010
-
coffee: 45%
-
barley: 32%
-
oranges: 35%
-
beef: 23%
-
pork: 68%
-
salmon: 30%
-
sugar: 24%,
...and the list goes on and on with the
worst yet to come.
The number of people in the United States needing food stamps to survive is
trending toward 45 million.
There are 60 million on Social Security and they
are not getting any cost of living allowance (COLA) increases to compensate
for inflation in 2010, nor will they get any in 2011. Those living on fixed
incomes or government assistance are being ravaged by exploding inflation. A
global food crisis is brewing and with it massive inflation is arriving at a
time when we have the most people on government assistance since the Great
Depression.
The price of food is going to continue to go up and the value of
our paper currencies will continue to go down as the race to the bottom
continues.
When a large segment of the population is facing a drastic cut in income in
the face of escalating food prices, we have a catastrophic problem in the
making. Today we have the simultaneous events of income
deflation and food
inflation, two high-speed express trains coming down the tracks at each
other, plus a financial crisis colliding with staggering crop losses that
are cutting deeply into available planetary food reserves.
Prices of food
are beginning to soar again just as millions are losing the ability to
afford a reasonable diet, though little of this is being observed or
reported. But soon even the blind will see.
Very few people in the U.S. have given any serious consideration to the
question of food security. This essay should convince people that its time
to start.
For the most part, were not aware of the problem, but if we look
hard at the hidden news we see that the handwriting is on the wall for an
unimaginable crisis that will come on us as early as next year.
