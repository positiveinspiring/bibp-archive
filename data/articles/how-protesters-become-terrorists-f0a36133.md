Police use tanks to combat
peaceful demonstrators
More and more lately, it seems I find myself asking the question just how
and when the Occupy protesters in the U.S. will be considered a threat to
Americas Homeland Security?
And then of course, treated as such. Surely I am
not off in the wilderness in literally feeling such an eventuality is all
but inevitable? Its hard for one in fact, not to imagine that our Federal
Governments outrageously overzealous If You See Something, Say Something!
campaign has been perfectly tailored to include those who are presently
demonstrating in the streets of America against economic injustice and
inequality.
After all, arent explosive devices or chemical
agents small and powerful enough to fit neatly into some hippy backpack
these days?
Naturally, the line of thought here embarked upon, vis-Ã -vis a government so
eagerly paranoid to keep Americans safe and increasingly hell-bent on
conducting witch hunt-like, intrusive domestic counter-terrorism policies.
Not to mention, being overly enthralled with its
own Military Industrial Complex, leads one to further postulate that there
are at least a few pesky laws in place to protect an individuals right to
free speech and/or constitutional civil liberties, which very well might be
evaded or suspended by politicians or police should perceived threats to
certain corrupt folks in lofty positions of money and power, conveniently
morph into national security issues.
Creating a situation, of course, which obviously
amounts to taking what have been up to this point relatively peaceful
protesters or demonstrations, and thwarting or crushing their existence, as
being terror-related?
There are some thoughtful Americans who believe that a so-called lone
wolf, alleged terrorist suspect (supposedly under surveillance for two
and-a-half years) arrested by New York City Police recently, was but a mere,
good old-fashioned, war on terror - patsy, and that the cash and
organization for his supposed plot, evidently foiled via the services of a
paid FBI informant, as has been reported, was actually provided by none
other that the U.S. Government.
And so as fate would have it, supposedly, and
quite suitably enough for the Mayor of New York City - as a result of this
particular obscure and isolated terrorist incident and/or apparent bit of
federal entrapment, there next comes the disproportionate repercussion from
Michael Bloomberg reportedly of deploying at least 1000 extra
counter-terrorism police to be on stand-by (one must assume) even within
the very midst of the Occupy Wall Street movement?
Should this strategy taking place via Bloomberg to protect the corporate
interests of Wall Street ripen to fruition, then I dont know about anyone
else, but I will find his excuse for installing an army and near police
state in the heart of Americas biggest city, during an ongoing protest
movement, to protect New Yorkers from some elusive and abstract so-called
terror threat, to be just a whole lot of ill-conceived, very dangerous,
patronizing bullshit.
I am not that gullible a fool, nor stupid enough
an American citizen, thank you very much. Are you?
The very last person this woefully deceitful
Nanny of a Mayor of New York, seeks to protect, is an ordinary New Yorker.
Not surprisingly, given the victory that terrorists have already achieved
over the American psyche, at least in Tampa, Florida - where a not so bright
public servant had the silly enough idea to roll a tank out of the garage in
response to a few dozen Occupiers, we have all been shown the writing on
the wall, so to speak, and just how the corporate and political status quo
intends to proceed in the end with a grassroots threat to its self-imposed,
precarious foundation and long-term security, ahead of time.
