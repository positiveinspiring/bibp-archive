The data sets interpreted for this report have been largely filled
with immediacy values,
probably due to the changing nature of time
itself, and its impact on humans.
This has necessitated a change in
our plans to release larger reports less frequently.
The new
approach will be to produce smaller, more focused reports, more
frequently.
The next targeted publication will be in early June. (We
think now.)
GlobalPop
Due in part to the [increasing (continuing) radiation disaster(s)]
in the Northern hemisphere, and the [financial (paper
abstractions/banking) disasters], as well as the
soon-to-be-in-your-face apparent [food growing disasters], the data
accretion patterns are describing a [(south flowing) river of
humanity].
The [illegal immigration] and [nuclear (and financial)
(and food) refugee] problem is indicated to emerge over the
remainder of 2011 with such force as to [stimulate/cause
(reactions)] in the [legal systems] of [southern hemisphere
nations].
While some of the [brave] and [foolhardy] will still attempt [air
travel] the [unfortunate incidents (of May/June/Summer 2011)] will
put a very large [dent] into the [demand] for [air travel].
This is
in spite of the actual demand for [transportation] southward.
True,
real horror will be known later (in 2011/early 2012) as the actual
levels of [airborne radiations] are [disseminated globally (by the
new human's radiation watch organization)] and the many [sheeple]
begin to question whether that trip to Disney world was really worth
[30/thirty thousand chest x-ray equivalents].
The data also points
to the [rumors] of [Summer 2011] that [commercial pilots] are
[wearing lead diapers] as a pre-saying of the [radiation soup (in
upper atmosphere)] meme that will later become so [ubiquitously
known] as to spawn a number of slang terms in several dozen
languages. The late night, high altitude, coast to coast air
transport (here in the USofA) will no longer be known as 'red eye',
but variously as the [mutation express], or the [bleeding ass
flights].
The [rumors] of [dangerous levels (of upper atmosphere
radiation)] over Summer 2011 are being described as [supported] by a
[wave] of [unexpected] levels of [retirements] by [pilots] both
[commercial] and [military]. The [military pilots retirement wave]
will be most [significant] in the American/NATO/Anglo empire, and
will lead to a [very brief] period of [the minion classes] pushing
for [expanded training] for [drone pilots].
The [advertising] for [new drone pilots], and the release of
[government backed/funded video games (simulation training
platforms)] for [drone pilots] can be taken as a very significant
temporal marker for events in both the Populace/USofA* entity as well
as the Markets entity.
Both of these entities have extensive cross
links from the [drone pilot shortage] areas over to the GlobalPop**
entity and, most ominously, the Terra entity where the terminators
are in a very large descriptor set for [catastrophic (northern
hemisphere) earthquake]. This [catastrophic earthquake] area is NOT
the most immediate of this particular descriptor set, and indeed,
these terminations are seemingly 3/three [catastrophic earthquakes]
out.
* Populace/USofA: Proxy for the
populace of the USofA. Defined broadly and representative of issues
which rise to national prominence.
** GlobalPopulace (GlobalPop): Proxy for all populace groups "not" part
of Populace/USofA. Division forced by emotional splits arising from
anti-Bush reactions post October 2001.
So at least 4/four such sets are gaining new values during this
last run. The interpretation here is that the (at least) [4/four
catastrophic earthquakes] of 2011 will include (at least) 2/two such
in the northern hemisphere.
The GlobalPop entity has the fourth of these [catastrophic
earthquake] data sets cross linked over to the language that will
appear in the [global (international) free press] about the [arming
of children (drone pilots)] with [weapons of mass destruction].
Further, the language forecast includes a lot of verbiage about how
a [coalition of nations] should [form] for the [purpose] of [regime
change], first in [Britain], and then the [USA].
As modelspace is
progressed deeper into Fall, and almost immediately after the
[regime change (off with their heads)] language, the [fourth
catastrophic earthquake] set makes its appearance. This would seem
to suggest that the earthquake itself is, as with the language that
precedes it, following the Fall equinox.
The [economic] sub set of the GlobalPop entity is filling with some
very grim, and disheartening aspects.
These are related directly to
the [dependence/addiction] of the [central bank and global warfare
system]. These sets would seem to suggest that the [global populace]
{ed note: including and led by populace/usofa} is to encounter
planetary [hyperinflation] shortly after the June solstice.
The [global hyperinflation] is coincident with, and frequently cited
(by
msm/propagandists) as being the cause of, the [global
revolution] meme sweeping through the planetary populace. The former
is correct, but not the latter. The [hyperinflation] *may be a
trigger, that is the 'spark that ignites the gunpowder', but it must
be noted that the powder has long been piling up, deeper and higher.
The [encounter (running head first into)] planetary [hyper
inflation] is mostly a [US dollar issue]. Those nations and groups
most closely bound to the [dying dollar] will suffer the most. The
[hyper inflation] sub set continues to grow through the rest of
2011. The real [pricing damage] has yet to be [encountered]. The
data is showing that 'sticker shock' is coming to a [store/market]
near you.
The data shows that [hyperinflation (of dollar linked
products/currencies)] will be a [demanding agenda item] at several
of the [minion class conferences] over Summer, and then a [point of
denial] and [avoidance] by Fall. The [hyperinflation] language is
specifically focused on [foods], and [oils (cooking)], and [energy].
The [precious metals hyperinflation in dollars] is not a particular
concern within these data sets within GlobalPop, though it does also
appear with strength.
The [globalrev] language sub set has added a number of new sub sets
which bring in different geographic areas. The data suggests that
[south seas/south east asia] will soon be involved in the continuing
[global revolution]. We note that the cross links from the [global
revolution] in GlobalPop entity over to the Populace/USofA entity
terminate in the expected [American revolution (part deaux)] sub set
as well as the [American empire collapse] sub set.
It is quite clear
that as the [American/anglo prominent, empire of the banksters]
dies, that the [dictators] at the periphery will be the first to
fall. As with all other [dying empires] the [provinces], and
[formerly propped up dictators] go first, as has been seen with
Egypt, and North Africa in general, and as is now [encircling] the
[red shield proxy state (Israel)].
Many of the [global revolution] sub sets, in both the GlobalPop and
the Populace/USofA entities are supported by [banking system bust]
sub sets either directly or through cross links.
Further, the data
sets specifically are focusing on [class warfare] globally as the
[individuals (and small collectives)] will be [presented] with
[shocking visual imagery] of the [vast separation] between
themselves and the [power elite]. This [division] is described as
being [sharply illuminated (pun intended)] by [food disparity] that
will be stupidly allowed to [repeatedly (be) video captured].
This
[food disparity] includes descriptions of [raiding (the trash bins)
of the rich] for [items of food]. As an aside, the data sets contain
some references to a huge [leak of information] that will come from
a [bin diving episode] in Southern Europe. This episode of
[information recovery (amidst food scraps)] is indicated to make a
[young European man] very [famous] and to [alter] his [life].
While
the details here are intriguing, there is so much more generally
applicable data that we cannot divert the flow.
Shortly after the [information (of concern to all humanity)
recovery] by the [bin diver], {ed note: very shortly thereafter,
maybe mere days} the data suggests that [acts (on the ocean/sea)]
which will be labeled as [piracy] by the [corporate shills] will
occur in the Mediterranean, and South Atlantic.
At least one of
these [incidents] will have [grave] consequences for the [elitists]
both specifically on the [mega yacht], and then more generally
throughout the [global elitists (including minions)]. As an aside,
the [establishment stooges/high ranking 'elected' political minions]
of the USA will [decry] these [acts of starving/desperate people] as
[brutal attacks (on the) 'natural order'].
This last set is
indicated to be something of a [rallying cry] during the [outbreak]
of [global revolution] here in the USA. It reads very much as the
modern equivalent of the famous 'let them eat cake' line from the
last big French Revolution. This area of sub sets are extensively
internally cross linked to the [collapse (of) global fisheries], and
externally to the Terra entity where they terminate in [extreme
(oceanic/Atlantic) disturbances/upheavals].
As the GlobalPop entity is progressed through the trying [summer
(northern hemisphere)] of 2011, the [corporate shill media],
especially in [Europe], and [South East Asia] will find itself
[bereft (of) support] when [video lies] are [uncovered].
The data
suggests that in several areas separated by [thousands of miles] and
[extreme cultural differences] (think Swiss and Philippines as an
example) a [spontaneous reaction] to [corporate propaganda
(masquerading as news)] will include [assaults (by mobs)] on [local
(fronts for) corporate media]. The data indicates [beatings (of
staff and presenters)] by [mobs], as well as at least one incident
in which the [media outlet facility] is [burned to the ground].
The
combination of the [disparate places, same response] occurrences are
among the last of the temporal markers for the [food riots] in
[southern Europe] which are described as [spilling over] into
[battles (with the) vatican mercenaries (Swiss guard?)]. These
[battles] are the last precursor to the [liberation (of
the vatican
secret repository) of knowledge].
It is interesting to note that the
data shows that a [heated/violent argument] inside [vatican central
control (their version of politbureau)] about just the [potential
(for starving Italians and refugees)] to [riot in Rome] will have
taken place shortly before the actual manifestation of this
[base/primal fear (of exposure of secrets)] occurs.
Hmmm... flabby
old debauched men in fancy dresses slugging it out... sounds like
something from a particularly funny Monty Python sketch.
Populace/USofA
The [economic design] that was [forced upon], and under which the
[populace/usofa] has been [laboring] for these last 2/two centuries,
is shown by modelspace as [going through upheaval], or
alternatively, being [over thrown (ass over head)] in Summer such
that it must be [redesigned] in [whole/totally/completely] from Fall
2011 onward.
The long term data sets (such as they are) indicate
that the [recrafting/rebuilding] of the [populace/usofa economic
system] will continue to [progress] in spite of the [emerging
collapse (of) the political system] over Fall and Winter (2011).
This [recrafting (of human to human economic interaction)] will not
be as may be imagined from this point in time.
Specifically there is
no 'grand plan' that will emerge, but rather, according to how the
Populace/USofA entity forms as modelspace is progressed forward, a
more [organic (self created/self designed/adaptive/distributed)
system] will slowly manifest as it creates itself. This is a good
sign for humans, but a very bad sign for the [planetary rulers (self
proclaimed elites who worship blood line above merit, and who are
addicted to ritual at a level that staggers imagination)].
The ['america problem'] is indicated to begin late in Summer of 2011
and continue through the rest of the year. It will start with
[resistance to] and [avoidance of] the [local political process] and
[state/regional political gatherings].
It will be the level of
[expressed distaste/disdain] that is indicated to [shock] the [low
level power wardens].
The [political minion class] of the [usofa]
sub set has its supporting sets filling with references to
[shocked], and [stunned], and [weakened (at the legs/support)] over
[Fall 'elections' 2011]. While not a [political election year] in
itself, the [response] to [local political process] over September,
and into Fall is described by the data as [making (minions) shit
themselves (in fear)] of [unknown future (aka 'what is coming')].
The Populace/USofA entity has a new supporting sub set for a
soon-to-emerge [movement (meme)] that will manifest within the
[populace] as [vegetarianism] is to 'sweep' North America as [meat
die off] begins.
The cause will be labeled/described as [bad blood].
It is not clear whether this is disease, or radiation exposure, or
some other cause, but the [social movement/change] is so large as to
[force] the [corporate (death as food) business] to respond with
[international advertising]. While bringing an increase in business
to the advertising companies, the net effect is described by the
detail layers as being [to expose] those [corporations (addicted to
blood)].
This [exposure] sub set has a large and continuing growth
in supporting aspect/attribute sets and is indicated by cross links
to [vex] TPTB/W (the powers that be/were). The data shows that
several [national debates] will arise that will [address (the)
national food body] in ways not considered since the early 1800's.
This [food body discourse] is part of, and a supporting layer
within, the [global revolution] sub set within the Populace/USofA.
A curious segue arises from the [bad meat promoting vegetarianism]
sub set within the Populace/USofA entity as the [new vegetarianism]
social movement will be [negatively] compared with both the [ufo
'abduction' craze] and the [conspiracy 'industry'] by both
[corporate shill media] and those [sheeple] so [fearful (by now)] of
[mega change (at the social order level)] that they will [react
violently (initially)] to the [proponents (of free range
vegetarianism)].
These [negative comparisons] will reach their peak
when the [msm (propaganda/corporate shills)] repetitiously refer
back to the [silver panic (buying)] which by that time will be a
past event. The [new vegetarianism movement] sub set builds cross
links over to the [silver (panic to own) frenzy] sub set within
Populace/USofA.
Noting that the [shills / faces] of [corporate
'news'] are demonstrably and collectively as aware as a rotten
stump, it should come as no surprise when the [corporate shill media
outlets] compare the rise of [vegetarianism] to the [extreme
conspiracy paranoia] that will have propelled so many [usofa
residents] to (successfully) [abandon] the [federal reserve cabal
dollar].
As an aside, the details within these related sub sets
suggest that even at the [peak/apex] of the [panic (to buy) silver
frenzy], those who [acquire] some [silver] even then will have
benefits over time.
Hmmm... so this time really is different, and
the TPTB/W really are going to [shit bricks] as the [masses turn (on
them and their institutions)].
This is the [long] and the [short] of it. Sorry, could not resist.
We have a [female personality] described in the Populace/USofA
entity who will be slowly, and by that we mean [slowly] gaining
[visibility] over this Summer, in North America. This [female
personality] is internally known as the [conjunction (of)
opposites], as her describing aspect/attribute sets are filled with
supporting sets seeming in [opposition] to each other.
As an
example, this [woman] is described as [short] so repetitiously, that
(so far) every supporting aspect has had [short] (or its opposite)
as an attribute. She is thus described by the data as [short (of)
stature ] {ed note: this context includes stature as in 'public
authority or status}, and [short haired], and [short tempered], and
[short swing (of arms)], and possessing [short (blunt) fingers], and
[short (powerful) legs].
Further the supporting sets include [short
(of patience) with bullshit], and [short of time (as in 'time
pressed and knows it')], and [short of love/tolerance (and likely is
very bigoted, but not as you may assume by the commonly consensus of
that word)], and [short (of) tongue (sparing of words)]. We also
need to note that as in this last, the [short of tongue], many of
her supporting aspect/attributes also include [brutal] as further
descriptor.
So we could write this as her being [short of tongue
(sparing of words to the point of brutal honesty)]. But also the
[brutal] as a supporting attribute is found in such contexts as
[short (and) brutal (of) demeanor)] and [(prone/predisposed towards)
brutal (and cutting) wit], and [blunt (to the point of brutality)],
and too many more to cite.
These supporting aspects/attribute sets
paint a rather unflattering, but perhaps required understanding of
the nature of the [short aspect woman] who will be making her
[presence] felt over this Summer (of Confusion) within North
American social order. The descriptions that either support this
[short/brutal female] directly, or are in direct supporting cross
links point to the 'other side of the coin', in that, as previously
noted, this [short/brutal (soon to be nationally affecting) female]
is also described by opposites.
These opposite aspect/attribute sets
are fewer in number than the [short/brutal] sets, but are nearly
equal in total emotional sums.
Hmmmm... which makes us think that the
aware observer may be able to locate her emergence just based on the
use of the word [contradiction] and its many variants as the [msm/shills
for corporate control (of planet)] attempt to wrap descriptors
around what they are witnessing.
This [short woman] who *will* be
[labeled] by the [msm/corporate shills] as [short on looks/beauty]
and with a labeled [unfeminine/unwomanly] [sharp, brutal, cutting,
eviscerating tongue] is also described as [long (on) intelligence],
and [long on gravitas], and so [long (on) physical presence] that
the details state that she will be described as [leaving a long
lingering feeling], or [felt (she was here) long after she left].
Further her [short/gutting wit] itself is also described as [long
wounding] and [cutting (deep and) long wounds].
The importance of the [short woman] is itself, at the meta data
level, quite unique in both the depth of the linguistic affects from
her personality, as well as the spread throughout the Populace/USofA
entity.
While there are many cross links over to other entities
including ThePowersThatWere, and GlobalPop, Markets and even
SpaceGoatFarts***, the clustering of the data sets as they accrue
points to this [short woman] as being [content] to keep her focus on
[north america].
*** SpaceGoatFarts (SGF)
This entity is newly formed. While references to Space Goat Farts have
appeared within Terra, sub set Space in the past, the data set now
demonstrates a need for an entity to allow for the growth of 'unknown
forces of all kinds from space which are terra/populace affecting'.
Includes non-earth based, non-human/non-mammal intelligent beings
usually considered as 'space aliens' or 'extraterrestrials'.
Created during 1207 clean up.
And, in the theme of the opposites at the meta data
level, while [she] is [feeling time pressed (perhaps older?)], the
data nonetheless shows a multiple generation impact from her [long
felt presence].
As an aside, there are detail sets within the SpaceGoatFarts entity that suggest something of a woo-woo tradition
will grow up around her [long after presence feeling] in that some
language will come out for [evidence (video? images?)] of an actual
[extended persistence of physical presence] not normally associated
with humans.
Note though that there are no data sets in SpaceGoatFarts to suggest that she is anything other than a regular
[short] human with a [short temper] and a [brutal attitude] as a
result of living too [long] with the [short sighted assholes (who
currently are manipulating the collective consensus reality)].
Again, nothing in the data to suggest that she is a space alien or
anything other than regular human. But the question will arise.
There are plenty of sub sets for the [questioning]. These appear in
both Populace/USofA and the SpaceGoatFarts entity, but neither will
be showing up until late in 2011, [long] after she has made her
first [short appearance] on the national consciousness. Also as an
aside, the paparazzi trying to take her [image] (somewhere in middle
west? Middletown?) with the [infrared camera] had better watch out.
While her arms are [short], her [reach (with thrown objects)] is
both [long] and [deadly accurate]. This section also brings up an
interesting personality component that will accompany her fame, her
ability with [eye hand coordination] will become much
[admired]... even to the point of forming its own area of
[personality cult focus].
Our [short woman, long on opposites] will be expressing the
[opposite] theme in universe by being first [noticed (nationally)]
for her [opposition] to??? something??? in a rather [dramatic]
manner.
The data suggests a [big (though short) splash] into
[national consciousness] followed by a [short absence (of
appearance)] and then a [long period (mostly of rumors of short
visits)] that is described as [percolating] through the [fluid
social situation] during the [revolution (against the federal
reserve note and central banksterism)].
So not only will the [long wit] expressing itself as a [short
female] be a very important temporal marker for [fiscal/financial
decay], but she will also be important both as a temporal marker
for, and more pointedly, a participant of, the [revolution (against
bankster colonialism (here in north america)].
Further sets within
the detail layers point to her being both a [distraction (used by
the media)] as well as a [key player] in the [upcoming (bankster
implosions)] and the [reformation (of the American political
system)].
The [distraction] sub set reads like a Holly-Wood (majic
stick, preferred wand material for sorcerers) movie plot. There are
areas that suggest that [local concerned citizens (aka 'gang
members')] will be [charged with] her [kidnapping], when the reality
will be exposed [by short woman] on [video] as a case of
[intervention] (by the local citizenry) to [prevent] the [bankster
stooges (aka 'private' law enforcement)] from [seizing her] at a
[public talk].
Seemingly something out of a novel, the supporting
sub sets suggest that she will become the [most interesting
fugitive] on the planet. It is from the [labeling] by the [msm/corporate
media] that her [international presence] will emerge, not directly
from her actions, but rather from the [short sighted response] by
TPTB/W and their [rather stupid minions].
The [short woman] in the middle of the [long revolution (against
banksters)] is also important as a SpaceGoatFarts temporal marker.
Her appearance on the North American media stage will also mark a
very brief count down to the next increase in the [alien wars]
emotional sums level. This temporal marker is most affective of the
north American populace given the number of cross links.
The
Populace/USofA entity has a very large number of termination points
in data sets going to the idea of [warfare] and [exposure (of inter
planetary, intra and inter species) skirmish] which are described as
also being in the media during the same time as the [short woman's
presence].
The largest area of growth within all of the sub sets of the [chaos
(in north america)] aspect/attribute set are within the [breaking
out/exposure of] the [hidden (shadow) civilization] within what is
called the [national security state] of the USA.
This sub set is of
critical importance, but as universe would have it, it will be
manifesting within a level of [chaos] so totally [absorbing], that
[public media faces (personalities)] will actually be [quoted] as
[questioning] the [capacity] of the [nation] to [continue (as a
national geo political identity)]. Against a background of such
levels of [chaos] that [systemic contacts (mail, electricity, food
deliveries)] are failing, the data sets suggest that nonetheless, a
[robust] level of [media (of all types)] coverage of the [continuing
chaos] which will include the [exposure] of the [off planet shadow
civilization].
Not that everyone will be paying attention. We must
also note that the Summer in North America is to be (from May onward
through into 2012) filled with [Terra intrusions] as [change states]
manifest across the planet.
So it will be difficult, under these
emerging circumstances, to keep a specific focus on off-planet
strangeness when the planet is changing itself under our feet.
Conclusion
The Tao
of Humanity Very few humans consider their place in, and
interaction with, the 'grander scheme of
manifesting reality'.
Oh, priests and other organized predator mind
controllers will blather on about god's plan, like they really had
a clue, but they don't. And they actually can't... but that is
another conclusion for another future...
Some humans do ponder themselves not as individuals, but as vital
(life) interacting with universe (energy). Gandhi (of liberation of
hindoo peoples from illuminati oppression fame), also known as
Mahatma (great one), spent time considering this duality of human,
and universe. And he came to a life lifting conclusion that while
each of our acts are totally insignificant to universe, they are
also totally necessary to it.
Even though insignificant to a degree
that mind cannot comprehend, it is absolutely necessary to universe
as a whole that the act be done. And so it is to us. If not done by
you, the act will nonetheless be completed to the satisfaction of
universe. And you will have missed an opportunity to be positively
changed by that act. Now note, one cannot, in this universe, avoid
their responsibility to act, and even choosing to not actively act,
is nonetheless, an act, so we each participate, even by avoidance.
What we miss though is the opportunity for positively changing
ourselves through harmonizing with opportunities presented by
universe.
How often are we presented with opportunities clear enough to make
meaningful choices within the broader waves of change that sweep
through our local segment of universe? Said another way, how often,
as adults, are we presented with opportunities to act heroically?
Well, up until recently, not so often.
However, as all the readers
of this report may come to feel personally (if they have not
already), the times, they are a'changing. These days are different,
and according to our data, universe is about to slap you upside the
head with that realization.
For many, the emergence of the Tao into humanity's collective
perception will be lost in the tumult and upheaval of worlds that is
now occurring. That the multitudes will NOT awake to the touch of
the Tao is apparently necessary to universe, as it is.
Since it is,
it must be a necessary component of universe that some not be
awakened, both for their own karmic needs, and to allow those who
are awake to thus distinguish themselves. And just as the rivers of
time constantly shift the grains of sand (us humans in case you
missed that poetic nod) laying on the river's bed, it is necessary
for universe that shifts happen. These shifts are appearing now, not
only to our data weary eyes, but also manifesting in the great
changes flowing through our collective experience that we label
humanity.
It is necessary to universe that many (perhaps most) humans
experience these changing times blindly oblivious to the larger
waves creating a new world/solar system around them.
They, the
unaware, the sheeple, will look up at the great changes that will be
soon sending their people-herds into panic and mindless stampedes
without understanding their place, part, or role in anything larger
than the flow of the immediate now. This, the tao, as it manifests
around and through them, will consume all their time, generate all
their thoughts, and create their reality as they experience it,
totally oblivious to it.
It must be so that universe may exist and express change. Change
must occur, in spite of all human efforts to oppose change, deflect
change, or control change, it must occur. And will so occur. As
universe directs. Not us. Including the 'aware' amongst the sheeple.
Those humans whose karmic burden is such that they need suffer
awareness now, in these days, will not 'awaken the masses'. They
will not, 'spark the revolution', nor 'incite the herd to turn'.
They may not so understand now the 'why' of it all, especially those
awakening minds in the early stages where it is ever-so-important to
meet the emotionally driven need to go out and slap all your
soon-to-be-ex friends among the sheeple herd to wake them up.
They,
we, do not understand, until later, that it won't work and will just
annoy the crap out of the sheeple who are being slapped in the face.
But, somehow, and for some 'why', it is necessary that a great many sheeple be slapped. It is necessary for universe to force massive
social changes at planet wide scale through humanity at this time,
and is also necessary, for you, at a personal level, to experience
these changes in some greater state of awareness than the general
sheeple herd.
That is your challenge.
That awareness alone, marks
you as being offered the opportunity of service by universe. This is
rare, as you well know. Not that many humans out there who are
really thinking beings, most are operating under
deep mind control,
and are blinded by false perception of reality.
Not you, nor anyone, ever need accept the karmic burden of service
to universe.
Nor is this some kind of submission to the will of some
other being. It does not work that way. Many humans will
(necessarily) confuse the opportunity provided by awakening to
reality with 'service' as it is dictated by the religious control
freaks (who really are freaks... disturbing, twisted, freakish minds
capable of killing and even consuming the flesh of humans for their
twisted understanding of reality).
The archetype for this 'captured
service' is the personality sold as Mother Teresa. Even she, on her
death bed, acknowledged that her 'awakening' was captured, and the
whole 'faith' religion thing was a waste of a life. Took her long
enough to realize it... but such is the nature of karmic burdens and
the filters that they place on our perception.
For its own reasons which are not particularly pertinent to humanity
which must live through it, universe is in the process of
transitioning, in a more dramatic than in the past fashion, to a new
operating state. That humans have been favored by universe in the
past offers some potential that we will also be well received in
this emerging future state.
But no guarantees exist in universe,
other than the guarantee of opportunity to experience change. And if
lucky, or personally karmically well situated, to not only
experience change, but to be changed by so experiencing it.
It helps to be an artist. That is to say, those who can self
identify as artists are able to more readily integrate the internal
changes that the art itself forces on its creator. Probably why
universe is an artist, and we are (some) of its works. As out, so
in.
It helps in integrating change as a part of life to be an artist. As
those who have made and sailed their own boats, baked and eaten
their own pies, sewn and worn their own clothes, hewn and built with
their own lumber, washed and served their fellow human, cared for
and assisted the dying, trained for personal change (meditation)
will tell you, the art changes the artist as much if not more that
the artist will change the materials of their art.
This is the point
of art. Any and all arts. Even those arts not yet discovered by
humanity. And even those arts ignored as art (only from the outside
is the householder thought consumed by his chores).
Art can and does change us even before we encounter it. And the
point of the exhibitions of others arts? Well, duh, to inspire some
other human to self-select as a change candidate in universe, and to
begin the process that is the art of living, which is to say, the
art of the discovery of one's self as artist.
All artists are in service to universe, though many are as oblivious
of this as the sheeple are to their mind control. It is through art
that service in the form of change is rendered to universe. And,
universe apparently appreciates this as it gives the mass of humans
some small percentage of artists, enough it would seem, the karmic
joy of expressing their art as pie bakers. And thus we, the rest of
us, are 'repaid' for our service here on earth.
We will all need to pie-up as universe moves a very large art
project forward. Our service to universe as artists is about to
challenged greatly as we assist universe in this transition to a new
expression of its art (life).
Our data has clear statements that
[service] to universe will be offering new opportunities to those
artists capable of perceiving and acting upon them. As with all
offers, they can be refused. But acknowledge now that refusal is
also a choice, and even it does not prevent failure. Remembering,
however, that failure is the process of art working itself out
through the internal obstacles of the artist, and that change is
art, pie up now, as your art is about to be challenged.
Your service
to universe is even now in a period where [opportunities to
change/expand] will be presented in the form of very large [holes in
common consensus reality] that will draw you in, artist tools at the
ready, too excited *not* to change your relationship to your service
to universe as it draws the Tao right out of you, exposing you to
yourself, and the opportunities for new service to humanity, as
universe expresses the Tao of it all... in our pies, and in front of
our eyes.
This is what is coming.
This is what you are feeling.
The Tao of humanity is discovering itself... through you.
Excitingly scary... yes?
We have added a copy of the solar intensity numbers as are
calculated by
Patrick Geryl below. These have so far
shown themselves to be meaningful predictors of
violent earth changes or violent weather. Take the dates as being in
the middle of an enlarging window of time.
As the numbers indicate,
the wave flowing through solar activity will still allow, by
reducing the intensity slightly, the sheeple to maintain some level
of 'normalcy bias', but expect that to be less persistent after
October of 2011.
Thus these numbers can be used to anticipate the next period of
large scale changes here on earth. And to prepare for them.
No, there will not be a crustal shift, nor a
Planet X induced 'roll
around' of earth.
Yes, there will be huge levels of persistent changes as the planet
grows. More winds, greater gravitational and magnetic effects among
shaking ground, sloshing seas, and terrible weather.
