-
A major with the
Nazi SS admitted at the
Nuremberg trials that - under orders from the chief of the Gestapo -
he and some other Nazi operatives faked attacks on their own people
and resources which they blamed on the Poles, to justify the
invasion of Poland.
Nazi general Franz Halder also testified
at the Nuremberg trials that Nazi leader Hermann Goering
admitted to
setting fire to the German parliament building, and then falsely
blaming the communists for the arson
-
The
CIA admits that it hired Iranians in
the 1950's to pose as Communists and stage bombings in Iran in order
to turn the country against its democratically-elected prime
minister
-
Israel admits that an Israeli terrorist
cell operating in Egypt planted bombs in several buildings,
including U.S. diplomatic facilities, then left behind "evidence"
implicating the Arabs as the culprits (one of the bombs detonated
prematurely, allowing the Egyptians to identify the bombers, and
several of the Israelis later confessed) (and see
this and
this)
-
The former Italian Prime Minister, an
Italian judge, and the
former head of Italian counterintelligence
admit that
NATO, with the help of the Pentagon and CIA, carried out
terror bombings in Italy and other European countries in the 1950s
and blamed the communists, in order to rally peoples support for
their governments in Europe in their fight against communism.
As one participant in this
formerly-secret program
stated:
-
"You had to attack civilians,
people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people far removed
from any political game. The reason was quite simple. They were supposed to force these
people, the Italian public, to turn to the state to ask for greater
security" (and see
this)
(Italy and other European countries subject
to the terror campaign had joined NATO before the bombings occurred)
-
As admitted by the U.S. government,
recently declassified documents show that in the 1960's, the
American Joint Chiefs of Staff signed off on a plan to blow up
AMERICAN airplanes (using an elaborate plan involving the switching
of airplanes), and also to commit terrorist acts on American soil,
and then to blame it on the Cubans in order to justify an invasion
of Cuba.
See,
Official State Department documents show that - only
nine months before - the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other
high-level officials
discussed blowing up a consulate in the
Dominican Republic in order to justify an invasion of that country.
(While the Joint Chiefs of Staff pushed
as a serious proposal for Operation Northwoods to be carried out,
cooler heads fortunately prevailed; President Kennedy or his
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara apparently vetoed the plan)
-
The South African Truth and
Reconciliation Council
found that, in 1989, the Civil Cooperation
Bureau (a covert branch of the South African Defense Force)
approached an explosives expert and asked him "to participate in an
operation aimed at discrediting the ANC [the African National
Congress] by bombing the police vehicle of the investigating officer
into the murder incident", thus framing the ANC for the bombing
-
An Algerian diplomat and several
officers in the
Algerian army admit that, in the
1990s, the Algerian army frequently massacred Algerian civilians and
then blamed Islamic militants for the killings (and see Agence France-Presse,
9/27/2002, French Court Dismisses Algerian Defamation Suit Against
Author)

Former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff General Hugh Shelton
says that a Clinton cabinet member
proposed letting Saddam kill an American pilot as a pretext for war
in Iraq (and see
this)
-
According to the
Washington Post,
Indonesian police admit that the Indonesian military killed American
teachers in Papua in 2002 and blamed the murders on a Papuan
separatist group in order to get that group listed as a terrorist
organization.
-
The well-respected former Indonesian
president
also admits that the government probably had a role in the
Bali bombings
-
As reported by
BBC, the
New York Times,
and
Associated Press, Macedonian officials admit that the government
murdered 7 innocent immigrants in cold blood and pretended that they
were Al Qaeda soldiers attempting to assassinate Macedonian police,
in order to join the "war on terror".
-
Former Department of Justice lawyer John Yoo
suggested in 2005 that the US should go on the offensive against
al-Qaeda, having our intelligence agencies create a false terrorist
organization. It could have its own websites, recruitment centers,
training camps, and fundraising operations.
It could launch fake terrorist
operations and claim credit for real terrorist strikes, helping to
sow confusion within al-Qaedas ranks, causing operatives to doubt
others identities and to question the validity of communications.

United Press International
reported in
June 2005:
-
U.S. intelligence officers are
reporting that some of the insurgents in Iraq are using
recent-model Beretta 92 pistols, but the pistols seem to
have had their serial numbers erased. The numbers do not
appear to have been physically removed; the pistols seem to
have come off a production line without any serial numbers.
Analysts suggest the lack of
serial numbers indicates that the weapons were intended for
intelligence operations or terrorist cells with substantial
government backing. Analysts speculate that these guns are
probably from either Mossad or the CIA.
Analysts speculate that agent
provocateurs may be using the untraceable weapons even as
U.S. authorities use insurgent attacks against civilians as
evidence of the illegitimacy of the resistance.

Quebec police admitted that, in 2007,
thugs carrying rocks to a peaceful protest were actually undercover

weapons near their body so they can pretend they were militants.
