# Latest Leak Confirms TTIP a 'Serious Threat to Democracy as We Know It'

EU member states and the
European Parliament will be "sidelined" in favor of big
business and U.S. interests should the TransAtlantic
Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) go through,
according to a leaked document revealed Friday.
The leak, of the
corporate-friendly trade deal's draft chapter on
"regulatory cooperation" between the EU and U.S., was
made public by The Independent and
Brussels-based campaign group Corporate Europe
Observatory (CEO).
It exposes,
"a labyrinth of
procedures that could tie up any EU proposals that go
against U.S. interests," as The Independent put
it, as well as "the extent to which major corporations
and industry groups will be able to influence the
development of regulatory cooperation."
As Kenneth Haar, researcher
for CEO, explained:
Lengthy procedures,
including vetting by business for possible economic
impacts, are thus envisaged for new regulations.
Such measures have
already been used informally to weaken EU ambition
on financial sector supervision in the years leading
up to the 2008 collapse, to offer a free pass to US
companies on personal data protection, and to delay
or water down EU proposals on animal testing and
aviation emissions.
This leaked document
from the negotiations confirms fears that the
Commission will be obliged to consult with US
authorities before adopting new legislative
proposals while EU Member States and the European
Parliament are sidelined.
The leak also offers a
glimpse at the proposed bureaucratic labyrinth of
impact assessments, dialogues, consultations and
reviews that could tie up any proposals that go
against US business interests.
In short, he said,
"this document shows how
TTIP's regulatory cooperation will facilitate big
business influence - and U.S. influence - on
lawmaking before a proposal is even presented to
parliaments."
Nick Dearden, executive
director of Global Justice Now, told The Independent:
"The leak absolutely
confirms our fears about TTIP. It's all about giving
big business more power over a very wide range of
laws and regulations."
As such, Haar added, the
TTIP represents,
"a serious threat to
democracy as we know it."
The proposed trade deal,
being negotiated in secret, faces
growing opposition across the
European continent.
Just last month, a report
from Global Justice Now and the
Netherlands-headquartered Transnational Institute
showed how the TTIP would undermine national
sovereignty by hampering governments' ability to enact
effective and fair tax systems to finance vital public
services.
Also last month, heavily
redacted documents obtained by The Guardian
revealed that European officials had assured
ExxonMobil that the pending U.S.-EU trade agreement
would force the removal of regulatory "obstacles"
worldwide, thus opening up even more countries to
exploitation by the fossil fuel empire.
After
the latest round of talks last month, trade
officials
pledged to accelerate negotiations in the hopes of
releasing a full draft text by this summer, and reaching
the final stage of talks by October.
However, speaking in Moscow
on Friday, former Prime Minister of Italy and former
President of the European Commission Romano Prodi
said he sees "no prospect" for the deal to be
finalized before the U.S. presidential election in
November.
Irish Prime Minister Enda
Kenny made similar remarks on Thursday,
telling journalists in Brussels:
"It now appears as if
the TTIP arrangements will not be completed before
the American presidential election," and adding that
this would probably create "a sense of vacuum."
