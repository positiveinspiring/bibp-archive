The incestuous embrace of privilege and power
by entrenched, socially isolated Elites
characterizes failed states
and brittle, doomed regimes throughout history.
Every system is optimized to serve a specific purpose.
As noted in my recent essay 'What Metric Are We Optimizing For?,' what the system optimizes is rarely explicitly stated. Sometimes this results from not understanding the metric that the system is designed to optimize; but in other cases, explicitly describing what the system optimizes would trigger social instability. The Status Quo around the world - from France to China to the U.S. - is optimized to protect its Elites and the sprawling Upper-Caste of,
academics managers think-tank toadies technocrats apparatchiks functionaries factotums lackeys and apologists,
academics
managers
think-tank toadies
technocrats
apparatchiks
functionaries
factotums
lackeys and apologists,
...who serve the Elites, and are well-paid for enforcing the Status Quo on the disenfranchised castes below.
Demographer Joel Kotkin, author of the new book The New Class Conflict, has coined the word Clerisy to describe what I have been calling the Upper Caste: America's new class system.
Oligarchs are assisted in their control by what Kotkin calls the "clerisy" class - an amalgam of academics, media and government employees who play the role that medieval clergy once played in legitimizing the powerful, and in implementing their policies while quelling resistance from the masses. The clerisy isn't as rich as the oligarchs, but it does pretty well for itself and is compensated in part by status, its positions allowing even its lower-paid members to feel superior to the hoi polloi. Because it doesn't have to work in competitive industries, the clerisy favors regulations, land-use rules and environmental restrictions that make things worse for businesses - especially the small "yeoman" businesses that traditionally sustained much of the middle class - thus further hollowing out the middle of the income distribution. But the lower classes, sustained by government handouts and by rhetoric from the clerisy, provide enough votes to keep the machine running, at least for a while.

This describes the Savior State perfectly: a centrally planned and controlled government that enforces its absolute control via force, legal regulations and the blandishments of complicity:
there's billions of dollars in free money social welfare to buy the loyalty (or at least the passivity) of the disenfranchised and marginalized.
I have often written about the stagnation of social mobility and the rise of a neo-feudal arrangement of social-economic strata:

The political, corporate/financial and National Security State Elites represent a vanishingly thin layer of the American economy and society.
America today is the nightmare scenario feared by James Madison and other Federalists:
a covertly created monarchical (what I term neo-feudal) empire much like the Roman Empire - a republic in name but in reality a highly centralized Empire operated for the benefit of tiny Elites who buy complicity of the masses with free bread and circuses.
The "Monarchical Federalists" Madison and Jefferson feared have indeed established a neo-feudal, neocolonialist Empire. In this context, it is interesting to note that fully 20% of all entitlements (tax credits, Medicare, Social Security, etc.) flows to the top 10%, 58% goes to middle-income households and 32% goes to the bottom 20%.
The swag of bread and circuses is remarkably well-distributed, buying off every sector of the populace. Behind the PR facade of democracy and free-market capitalism, a parasitic Aristocracy extracts income and wealth from a financially indentured class of serfs.
This Aristocracy is composed of several Elites which are served by the Upper Caste of technocrats.
These Elites and the Upper Caste serve each others interests, a social hierarchy that Hilton Root characterized as a,
"society divided into closed, self-regarding groups."
The slow trickle of the "best and brightest" into the Upper Caste via Ivy League university admission is also a propaganda facade, as Ron Unz ably and exhaustively proves in 'The Myth of American Meritocracy - How corrupt are Ivy League admissions?' The trick is enable just enough meritocracy to support the PR facade. The Ivy League has mastered that balancing act. These Elites have few if any links to the social layers below.
Charles Murray spoke to some aspects of this trend of financial/social Elitist isolation from the debt-serfs and worker-bee class below in Coming Apart - The State of White America, 1960-2010, but the key dynamic that is outside Murray's sociological purview is the stark reality that the Elite class is devoid of any real feeling for or interest in the common good or public weal. That is, not only have the key institutions of American governance and power lost the memory and mechanics of good governance, the Elites running the institutions have become an inbred neo-feudal Aristocracy characterized by an unexamined (and thus deeply adolescent) sense of entitlement to the reins of power and control of the national income. It's not just the institutions that have lost any conception of good governance - the Aristocracy ruling the nation has lost all interest or recognition of the common good.
This is of course not unique to America; the same disregard for the common good is at the root of all developed-world and developing-world failed states. The incestuous embrace of privilege and power by entrenched, socially isolated Elites characterizes failed states and brittle, doomed regimes throughout history.
This is what the Status Quo everywhere is optimized for:
protecting those who have secured the wealth, perquisites and power by strangling competition, democracy and social mobility.
If you want to pinpoint the one dynamic pushing the global economy into not just a prolonged recession but a parallel period of massive social instability, look no farther than the social and financial stagnation that results from optimizing the system to benefit the Elites and the entrenched incumbents who protect them from competition and the dispossessed debt-serf classes below.
