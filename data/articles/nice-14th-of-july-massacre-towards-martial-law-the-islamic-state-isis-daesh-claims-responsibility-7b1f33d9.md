Another terror event in France resulting in a dramatic and tragic loss of life. On Bastille Day, 14th of July, the day commemorating the French Revolution of 1789, the most important French National Holiday. This time in Nice, killing at least 84 people, many children - and leaving scores injured.
What happened? During last night's celebration of the French National Holiday, around 11 PM, a speeding truck plowed into a crowd of thousands who were watching the fireworks along the Mediterranean Boulevard Anglais.
The driver of the truck, was simultaneously and indiscriminately shooting into the crowd. He was able to run for 2 kilometers before being stopped by police, which instantly shot and killed him. A horrendous terror attack, killing hordes of people, spreading pain, misery, fear and outrage in France, Europe - the world over. All indications signal the Big Script of yet another false flag; yet again in France. The young truck-driver was identified as Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a 31-year-old Frenchman, resident of Nice, with Tunisian origins.
As in previous cases, 'coincidence' has it that his identity papers were found in the truck.

The young man is instantly killed by the police. Dead people cannot talk. A pattern well known by now... The man's Tunisian roots may soon pin him to a terrorist Jihad group - if not de jure, then de facto, as the propaganda machine will spread the news and instill yet more Muslim hatred among the western population.
The Islamic State Media reports suggest that the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the terror attack.
France is identified as "Enemy Number One of the Islamic State (Daech)" ISIS based in Northern Syria is financed and supported by America's 'closest' allies,
Turkey Saudi Arabia,
Turkey
Saudi Arabia,
...as confirmed by a recent British Parliamentary report.
It also has links to US intelligence. It is not clear how the truck was able to breach the barriers to the promenade closed for pedestrians and spectators during the 14th of July celebration. According to eye-witnesses, it took the police and firemen about half an hour to get to the scene.
Martial Law - The Broader Implications
How is it possible that such a crowd is not 'protected' by patrolling police and military? And that in a country under effective Martial Law?
How is it possible that such a crowd is not 'protected' by patrolling police and military?
And that in a country under effective Martial Law?
President Hollande spoke to the nation in an emotionless tone, reading what he was to say. None of his words sounded heartfelt. He spoke as if the terror event came as no news to him.
His speech was concentrating on declaring a three-month extension of the 'State of Emergency' - effectively Martial Law - which was in place since the last November Bataclan Paris attacks and was to expire on 26 July 2016.
Despite this Martial Law, a celebration of this magnitude, unique each year for France - where millions of people are in the streets and celebrating, strangely no police or military protection was present. Hollande spoke of a terrorist event. His Minister of the Interior, Bernard Cazeneuve, called the truck driver a 'terrorist'.
While causes of this tragic event are unclear, President Hollande will eventually achieve his objective:
being the first country in Europe with permanent Martial Law...
He has already declared to extend the current State of Emergency for another three months, when it expires on 26 July. Such a temporary extension is in his power.
He will have plenty of time to force it through Parliament - thereby prompting other EU countries to do likewise.
Martial Law - The Geopolitical Dimensions Why France? Naturally, Hollande follows Washington's orders...
He is the most spineless puppet in Europe, making France the foremost EU vassal of America. And that in a post-Brexit ambiance, where according to several polls 70%-80% of the French people are anti-EU and would vote for a Frexit, if they were given the chance to vote.
This is a considerable increase since the Brexit referendum. Washington needs a militarized Europe to be controlled by force, to impose its corporate financial rule, to push the TTIP down the throat of the Europeans, to make Europe the new and effective low-cost high-tech colony of the empire, and an unfailing buffer zone to Russia. Cold War all over again...
This time not so cold any more. WWIII is an imminent possibility, thanks to the EU vassals in Brussels giving NATO free reign to advance ruthlessly towards Moscow. Surely, before long some Islamic 'terror group' will claim credit for the horror event. The usual. Let there be no doubt, as to who are the enemies of humanity - of 'Western Humanity' - the superior people, that is... In the coming weeks it will be a piece of cake to slide this 'law' through the French Parliament as a permanent fixture in the French Constitution.
That's what Washington wants. That's what Washington will get, thereby not only inciting but forcing other European nations to do likewise, putting their citizenry under military power. How long will it take until We, the People, wake up and see the light?
The Nice Terror Attack
- Towards a Permanent State of Emergency? - by Gearóid Ó Colmáin July 15, 2016 from GlobalResearch Website
The death toll from the Nice attacks on the 14th of July, 2016 is rising. Latest reports suggest 84 deaths and possibly one hundred more injured. There have been reports of gunfire and the driver of the truck which drove into the crowd near the beach in Nice is reported to have been shot dead. Once again (as with the Charlie Hebdo and Bataclan attacks) there is no-one to stand trial and truthfully answer the questions that need to be asked - who and why? At this point, there is not much that can be verified about the attack. One cannot exclude the possibility that it may have simply been the action of an insane individual. Atrocities of that type are rare but have happened in the past. But there is, however, the strong suggestion and indeed likelihood that this atrocity is a terrorist attack by 'Islamists'.
So, what does all this mean? French domestic intelligence (DGSI) chief Patrick Calvar warned on the 26th of June 2016 that an 'Islamist' attack on French children would be the trigger for a civil war. He said France was currently on the brink of that civil war.
Calvar also predicted that ISIS (Da'esh) would use trucks as weapons.
It is not unusual in the never-ending war on terror to hear accurate predictions by intelligence officials before attacks, with the same officials seemingly powerless to prevent them. This 'uncanny coincidence' could be the defining event of our time. French Prime Minister, Manuel Valls is on record stating that the state of emergency in France would be permanent. There has been increasing pressure on the Hollande regime in France to change course in the Middle East. Attempts to reconcile with Russia and lift the sanctions have been blocked by Hollande and Valls. I believe this is the trigger for a civil war French intelligence warned us about. The question is whether the war will become high intensity or continue on a relatively low-intensity trajectory.
There have been police 'whistleblowers' in France who have warned of huge caches of arms in major cities, capable of arming hundreds of thousands of men.
However, one must be cautious in referring to such 'whistleblowers' as they have proven to be highly unreliable and may be spreading disinformation. In any case, the public's belief that we are in a 'state of war' and that all military interventions abroad are therefore necessary will be enough to make citizens look to the state for protection - an oligarchic state which is currently pursuing a brutal class war against workers. As 90 percent or more of intelligence operations today involve media disinformation, we cannot possibly assume that any of the reports we are hearing are accurate. However, it is hard to see how a psyop could have been carried out in the Promenade des Anglais which is so central in Nice.
What we can say for sure is that the attack serves the two constants of the war on terror dialectic.
The narrative would read as follows:
Make the state of emergency permanent, empowering the oligarchic state and further demoralizing citizens by dividing the working class along religious and racial lines. This is part of NATO's 'strategy of tension' in accordance with the longstanding intelligence operation Gladio. Citizens must turn to the anti-social state for 'security', thus precluding social revolt. Justify an all out attack on Syria to finish the job of destroying Arab civilization, in accordance with US-NATO-Israel geopolitical interests. Only the willfully ignorant could possibly believe that ISIS is an enemy of France when the French have never had better relations with the country which openly backs them - Saudi Arabia. The intelligence reports, declassified documents and admissions of the highest officials of the French and American governments all confirm that ISIS is Israel's Arab legion.

Both those two above-mentioned goals serve the interests of US-NATO-Israel and until the French people liberate themselves from its yoke, Zionism will continue to poison the minds of men, making them consent to policies that no honest and compassionate human being would countenance. An awakening of working-class militancy is occurring but the labor movement in France remains divided and led by social-democratic reformists.
Now, more than ever, seeing the link between terrorism and class war is essential if any political and social change is to occur.
In an era of high-finance treason, oligarchy, austerity, and the triumph of avarice, terror increasingly becomes a feature of the normal rather than an exceptional exercise of state power.
