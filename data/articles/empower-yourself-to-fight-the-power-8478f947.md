The enemies of truth, freedom, and justice are highly mobilized, well
funded, and efficiently organized.
The institutional structures of power, whether local, national or global,
are effective mechanisms through which
the ruling groups of society
establish and entrench their influence, build consensus among each other,
brainwash and expand their control over the masses and society as a whole.
Whether they take the form of,
...they are
institutions of control and conquest.
Whether that conquest is ideological or physical, the effect is the same:
the conquered are oppressed and repressed.
These institutions are financed through the
global banking system of
collusion between the private banks and quasi-governmental central banks,
who control the money supply and value of the change in your pocket, which
are in fact a highly concentrated group of institutions and individuals.
-
Never in all of human history have so few controlled so much on such a
global scale, nor have so many had so little on an equally global scale.
-
Never before in history have the mechanisms for
absolute total global
control and oppression been within such close reach.
We are seeing the
emergence of this 'new society' in which governments are increasingly
imperialistic abroad and militaristic at home, as domestic police states are
established under the guise of 'homeland security', sold on the pretense of
protecting people from terrorists, but in actuality are
designed to protect
the powerful from the people.
Increasingly, civil rights and freedoms are being dismantled for the wider
populations: countries and peoples all around the world are subjected to
bombings, drone attacks from flying killer robots in the sky named
"Predators", and high-tech military equipment is designed and used to more
effectively kill and conquer poor people all around the globe.
In the emerging 'homeland security states', technology is being used to spy
on people, all internet traffic monitored, phones tapped, cameras recording
not only our images, but through biometrics they are categorizing and
quantifying our specific individual faces and emotional responses.
We are,
increasingly, seeing the emergence of a hybrid nightmarish scenario of
'Brave New World' meets '1984.'
Technology has largely facilitated the
advances in these areas and has, for the first time in all of human history,
made possible the notion of a truly global police state.
Yet... there is still hope.
The Technological Revolution has not only facilitated a more rapid and
effective apparatus for the institutions of power to exploit in methods of
oppression and control, but it has simultaneously facilitated the rapid and
effective means through which more people than ever before in human history
have access to and empowerment through information and communication on a
truly global scale.
As a result of
the Internet, the traditional institutions of power have lost
their monopoly of
control over information and communication.
The very same technological advances that make possible their methods of
control and conquest are simultaneously making possible their eventual
downfall and failure. While the powerful have the money and are highly
centralized, the rest of the world increasingly have the means and remain
highly decentralized.
And while the powerful are few, the rest are many.
The
Internet and social media have become effective means through which people
are able to empower themselves to struggle against and expose the
institutions of power that seek to oppress and control them. Naturally,
those same institutions seek to influence - whether overtly or covertly -
those very same avenues of social media, they are still effective and
available for the struggle for liberation from oppression.
We have been able to harness these new communications technologies. We are
committed to providing free and accessible information to the many in order
to expose the few.
Our aim is to struggle against and expose the institutions of power, and to
empower the people to take this endeavor into their own hands... and onto
their own keyboards.
To continue to provide information and battle the spread of disinformation,
Global Research needs your help.
We are aware that
the world is in rough economic times, and we have been at
the forefront in warning that they are likely to continue to get worse; and
so while Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase may be breaking records and their
executives signing their own bonuses, the vast majority of the world's
people do not have this luxury.
However, there is still something that
everyone can do to help in the cause and to help advance that cause and
become more effective in our aims.
