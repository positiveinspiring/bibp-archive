# Putin Did NOT Assassinate Opposition Leader - Says Russian Opposition

With the murder of Russian
opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, gunned down on a Moscow street,
the fiercest critic of President Vladimir Putin has been removed
from the political stage.
But it remains to be seen whether,
in death as in life, Nemtsov will remain a threat to Putin's
rule.
Already, city authorities have
approved a mass march for up to 50,000 people in central Moscow
on Sunday. The march, expected to be far larger than the
scheduled protest rally it replaces, will provide a powerful
platform for Kremlin critics who suspect a government hand in
Nemtsov's death.
Even officials in Putin's government
seem to sense the danger that the former first deputy prime
minister's martyrdom might pose, hinting darkly that Friday
night's drive-by shooting may have been an deliberate
"provocation" ahead of the planned weekend rally.
