As previously noted in Pawns of the
Global Elite,
Barack
Obama was groomed for the presidency by key members of the
Trilateral Commission. Most notably, it was
Zbigniew Brzezinski, co-founder of the Trilateral Commission
with David Rockefeller in 1973, who was Obama's principal foreign policy
advisor.
The pre-election attention is reminiscent of Brzezinski's tutoring of Jimmy
Carter prior to Carter's landslide election in 1976.
For anyone who doubts the Commission's continuing influence on Obama,
consider that he has already appointed no less than eleven members of the
Commission to top-level and key positions in his Administration.
According to official Trilateral Commission membership lists, there are only
87 members from the United States (the other 337 members are from other
regions). Thus, in less than two weeks since his inauguration, Obama's
appointments encompass more than 12% of Commission's entire U.S. membership.
Is this a mere coincidence or is it a continuation of dominance over the
Executive Branch since 1976?
(For important background, read The
Trilateral Commission: Usurping Sovereignty.)
-
Secretary of Treasury, Tim Geithner
-
Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan
Rice
-
National Security Advisor, Gen. James L.
Jones
-
Deputy National Security Advisor, Thomas
Donilon
-
Chairman, Economic Recovery Committee,
Paul Volker
-
Director of National Intelligence,
Admiral Dennis C. Blair
-
Assistant Secretary of State, Asia &
Pacific, Kurt M. Campbell
-
Deputy Secretary of State, James
Steinberg
-
State Department, Special Envoy, Richard
Haass
-
State Department, Special Envoy, Dennis
Ross
-
State Department, Special Envoy, Richard
Holbrooke
There are many other incidental links to the
Trilateral Commission, for instance,
-
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is
married to Commission member William Jefferson Clinton.
-
Geithner's informal group of advisors
include E. Gerald Corrigan, Paul Volker, Alan Greenspan and Peter G.
Peterson, among others. His first job after college was with Henry
Kissinger at Kissinger Associates.
-
Brent Scowcroft has been an unofficial
advisor to Obama and was mentor to Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
-
Robert Zoelick is currently president of
the World Bank
-
Laurence Summers, White House Economic
Advisor, was mentored by former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
during the Clinton administration.
There are many other such links, but these are
enough for you to get the idea of what's going on here.
Analyze the positions
Notice that five of the Trilateral appointees involve the State Department,
where foreign policy is created and implemented.
Hillary Clinton is certainly in line with
these policies because her husband, Bill Clinton, is also a member.
-
What is more important than economic
recovery? Paul Volker is the answer.
-
What is more important than national
intelligence? Gen. James Jones, Thomas Donilon and Adm. Dennis Blair
hold the top three positions.
-
What is more important than the Treasury
and the saving of our financial system? Timothy Geithner says he has
the answers.
The State Department is virtually dominated by
Trilaterals:
-
Kurt Campbell
-
James Steinberg
-
Richard Haass
-
Dennis Ross
-
Richard Holbrooke
This leaves Susan Rice, Ambassador to the
U.N.
The United Nations is the chosen instrument for ultimate global governance.
Rice will help to subvert the U.S. into the U.N.
umbrella of vassal states.
Conflict of interest
Since 1973, the Commission has met regularly in plenary sessions to discuss
policy position papers developed by its members. Policies are debated in
order to achieve consensuses. Respective members return to their own
countries to implement policies consistent with those consensuses.
The original stated purpose of the Trilateral Commission was to create a
"New International Economic Order."
Its current statement has morphed into fostering
a,
"closer cooperation among these core
democratic industrialized areas of the world with shared leadership
responsibilities in the wider international system."
See The Trilateral Commission web site
U.S. Trilateral members implement policies
determined by a majority of non-Americans that most often work against the
best interests of the country.
"How," you say?
Since the administration of Jimmy Carter, Trilaterals held these
massively influential positions:
-
Six out of eight World Bank presidents,
including the current appointee, Robert Zoelick
-
Eight out of ten U.S. Trade
Representatives
-
President and/or Vice-President of every
elected administration (except for Obama/Biden)
-
Seven out of twelve Secretaries of State
-
Nine out of twelve Secretaries of
Defense
Is this sinking in?
Are you grasping the enormity of it?
Endgame is at hand
For the Trilateral crowd, the game is about over.
The recent reemergence of original members,
...serves to reinforce the conclusion that the
New International Economic Order is near.
The Trilateral Commission and its members have engineered the global
economic, trade and
financial system that is currently in a state of total
chaos.
Does that mean that they have lost? Hardly.
As I recently wrote in
Chorus call for New World Order, they
are using the crisis to destroy what remains of national sovereignty, so
that a
New World Order can finally and permanently
be put into place.
Conclusion
The Obama presidency is a disingenuous fraud. He was elected by promising to
bring change, yet from the start change was never envisioned. He was
carefully groomed and financed by the Trilateral Commission and their
friends.
In short, Obama is merely the continuation of disastrous, non-American
policies that have brought economic ruin upon us and the rest of the world.
The Obama experience rivals that of Jimmy Carter, whose campaign slogan was
"I will never lie to you."
When the Democrat base finally realizes that it has been conned again (Bill
Clinton and Al Gore were members), perhaps it will unleash a real political
revolution that will oust Trilateral politicians, operatives and policies
from the shores of our country.
If the reader is a Democrat, be aware that many Republicans and
conservatives are still licking their wounds after finally realizing that
George Bush and Dick
Cheney worked the same con on them for a disastrous eight years of
the same policies!
