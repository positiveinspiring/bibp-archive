The Obama Administration, which in 2009 provided the crucial assistance that enabled the progressive democratic President of Honduras to be overthrown and a junta of oligarchs to replace him; and which in 2014 perpetrated a bloody coup that replaced the corrupt but democratically elected Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, replaced by a rabidly anti-Russian equally corrupt Government, and thus sparked Ukraine's civil war against the area of Ukraine that had voted 90% for Yanukovych; is now again trying to overthrow Venezuela's democratically elected President, Nicolas Maduro.
Reuters on Monday March 9th headlined "U.S. Declares Venezuela a National Security Threat, Sanctions Top Officials," and their report gives its closing word to an opposition politician, whom Obama supports and who says:
"It's not a problem with Venezuela or with Venezuelans; it's a problem for the corrupt ones" (i.e., Maduro and his Government).
In other words, yet again, the idea Obama is pushing is: we're just trying to replace a 'corrupt' elected head-of-state.
The White House explains its Executive Order on March 9th by saying:
"President Obama today issued a new Executive Order (E.O.) declaring a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the situation in Venezuela Specifically, the E.O. targets those determined by the Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State, to be involved in actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions."
"President Obama today issued a new Executive Order (E.O.) declaring a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the situation in Venezuela
Specifically, the E.O. targets those determined by the Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State, to be involved in actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions."
The Executive Order itself declares that the existing Government of Venezuela limits rights and is corrupt, which,
"constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat."
On 14 February 2015, President Nicolas Maduro had thwarted a coup-attempt against him by the Governments of Canada and the UK.
This followed almost exactly a year after he had already thwarted such an attempt by the U.S. Government. In December 2013, the Maduro Government presented detailed evidence that the U.S. was planning a coup against him.
On 15 January 2015, Maduro met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin. The Obama Administration is, of course, especially trying to bring down President Putin.
President Obama is also trying to bring down Syria's President Bashar al-Assad. In 2011, he had bombed away the regime of Libya's President Muammar Gaddafi.
Both Assad and Gaddafi also are/were allies of Russia, as is Iran.
The Obama Administration is now assisting ISIS in its war against Assad, even while bombing ISIS.
