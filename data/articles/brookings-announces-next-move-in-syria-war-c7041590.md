By the US policy think-tank Brookings Institution's own admission, the
Kofi Annan six-point peace plan in Syria was merely a ploy to buy time
to reorganize NATO's ineffective terrorist proxies and provide them the
pretext necessary for establishing NATO protected safe havens from which to
carry out their terrorism from.
In fact, Brookings actually stated in a recent
report, "Assessing
Options for Regime Change":
"An alternative is for diplomatic efforts to
focus first on how to end the violence and how to gain humanitarian
access, as is being done under Annans leadership. This may lead to the
creation of safe-havens and humanitarian corridors, which would have to
be backed by limited military power.
This would, of course, fall short of U.S.
goals for Syria and could preserve Asad in power. From that starting
point, however, it is possible that a broad coalition with the
appropriate international mandate could add further coercive action to
its efforts."

Change, Brookings Institution.
As if to alleviate any lingering doubts, NATO's
"Alliance News Blog" has confirmed that the US is committed not to "peace,"
but rather to the overthrow of Syria's government and is,
"already committed
to helping [President Bashar al-Assad] fall," but is "merely looking for the
least violent, lowest cost way to get there."
The April 9, 2012 blog entry features an op-ed
titled, "US 'already committed to helping Assad fall'," and fully admits
that the US is equipping the so-called "Free Syrian Army" which has received
weapons, leadership, and cash from the NATO-backed Libyan Islamic Fighting
Group (LIFG) terrorists led by notorious mass-murderer
Abdul Hakim Belhaj.

reports that the US is already committed to helping
"Assad fall" and is simply using the lull in fighting
brought on by Kofi Annan's disingenuous "peace plan" to
rearm, reorganize, and redeploy their terrorist proxy
forces against Assad.
The
op-ed featured on NATO's blog was
featured in the LA
Times and written by
CFR member Doyle McManus.
And now, the Brookings Institution itself has
predictably declared the Annan "peace deal" a failure and states that the
time to "stretch" Syria's military to the breaking point through expanded
foreign-backed unrest has come.
In an article titled, "Annan's Mission
Impossible: Why is everyone pretending that the U.N. plan in Syria has a
prayer of succeeding?" Brookings Doha Center director Salman Shaikh
insults the intelligence of his readership while handing out useful talking
points surely to be parroted by the corporate-media over the next few days
and weeks.
Shaikh depicts the ceasefire's failure as solely
the result of the Syrian government's belligerence and brutality, while
mentioning nothing of the Syrian opposition's documented and even admitted
atrocities.
Video: Michael Weiss
of the Neo-Con "Henry Jackson
Society,"
openly admits that diplomatic options are
being paraded publicly to satisfy public opinion, but
ultimately NATO plans to unilaterally intervene
militarily in Syria, and will do so with the UN's
purposefully sabotaged "humanitarian operation" as its
pretext.
And while portraying the Syrian government as
irrationally carrying out a campaign of brutality against the Syrian people,
Shaikh admits that the "Free Syrian Army" is operating militarily out of
Turkey and that the Syrian National Council (SNC) represents foreign
harbored and influenced leadership.
While Shaikh portrays Syria's minorities as "on
the sideline," he declines from explaining why they have not joined the
foreign-driven unrest.
In reality, these groups have been the hardest
hit by rebel atrocities,
including Syria's large Christian communities.
Christians in Syria have been particularly hit hard by
what is being described as "ethnic cleansing," not by
Syrian security forces, but by NATO-backed death squads
under the banner of the "Free Syrian Army."
The
LA Times has been quietly reporting on the tragedy of
Syria's minorities at the hands of the Syrian rebels for
months - and indicates that wider genocide will take
place,
just as it is now in Libya, should Syria's
government collapse under foreign pressure.
Shaikh's shoddy salesmanship also reveals
another truth - when he claims that,
"opposition leaders inside and outside the
country do not have the resources to unite their ranks alone."
Surely any opposition group that represented the
vast majority of the Syrian people, as the UN and the corporate-media claim
daily, would not have trouble finding the resources inside of Syria "alone."
In reality, the unrest in Syria is driven by a
foreign-backed violent minority, carried out by a combination of violent
Sunni-extremists from Syria and many foreign fighters brought in from
abroad.
Many of Syria's real opposition find the "Free Syrian Army's"
collaboration with foreigners "unacceptable."
NATO and its proxies' efforts have failed primarily because the movement's
semi-covert foreign backing is still not enough to turn the tide, and more
overt backing is needed, including foreign military intervention.
Shaikh's entire argument hinges on the creation
of a "genuine grand opposition coalition " that currently, admittedly,
does
not exist.
As the Brookings Institution prepares the next stage of its premeditated
escalation against the sovereign nation-state of Syria, and continues
framing the violence as one-sided, a torrent of reports even from the
corporate-media itself confirms what many geopolitical analysts have been
saying for over a year - that the "Free Syrian Army" is conducting a vicious
campaign of terrorism leaving Syrian security forces no choice but to
continue fighting on to restore order.
In fact, just today, Wednesday May 9, 2012,
Syrian rebels attempted to
attack a convoy consisting of Kofi Annan's UN monitors.
France inexplicably then blamed the Syrian
government for not providing adequate security for the UN monitors, after a
year of condemning the government for attempting to restore order in the
face of the very growing militant violence the attacks resulted from. And in
recent weeks, everything from Human Rights Watch reports, to
open admissions
from the rebels themselves confirm that they are committing widespread human
rights abuses and turning toward indiscriminate bombing tactics.
This indicates a threat Syria's government would
be remiss not to counter - and surely a threat the "international community"
would be remiss to continue supporting, funding, and even arming.
Now a concerted effort will be made to sabotage the UN peace plan in every
shape, form, and manner, especially through increased violence and
particularly in cross-border incidents to help sell NATO-backed, Turkey-led
incursions into Syria to carve out "safe havens."
From there a steady stream of weapons and
fighters from around the world will be funneled in, in an attempt to, as
Brookings Shaikh puts it, stretch Syria's forces "to a breaking point."
The
cover of the
CFR's flattering report on US-Turkey
relations, full of empty promises to entice Turkish
leaders into falling on their swords for Western
ambitions across the Middle East.
And
of course, the report is written in the context of what
Turkey can do for the US in terms of Syria and Iran in
particular.
Pro-genocide Madeleine Albright chaired (below video) the "task force"
that produced the report:
To help convince Turkey to "take the plunge" for
NATO, the Council on Foreign Relations has recently published a report
attempting to flesh out an improved alliance between the US and Turkey -
claiming the new relationship would
trump the potential for US cooperation
with any BRICS nation (except perhaps India).
This patronizing political stunt attempts to
fill Turkish leaders with delusions of grandeur, tempting them with
"goodies" ahead of falling on their swords for Wall Street and London's
ambitions in Syria and Iran.
Turkish leaders might reassess such grandiose
claims and remember BRICS' growth and benefits are based on solidarity and
production, avoiding "alliances" with Wall Street, London, and their
institutions, while conversely, Wall Street and London's "benefits" are
based on domination, exploitation, betrayal, and unsustainable pyramid
schemes.
Syria's fate rests on both Syria and its allies' ability to produce a
tactical reality on the ground that would make any foreign military
incursion a disaster. It also depends on either Turkey's wisdom or
foolishness in considering the elementary ploy and poisoned "goodies" the
West is dangling in front of it in exchange for complicity in dividing and
destroying neighboring Syria.
The corporate-financiers centered around the capitals of the West have
committed to
a global war aimed at permanently destroying nation-states and
replacing them with a homogeneous administrative system built out of Wall
Street and London-funded NGOs, interlocking with the West's contrived
"international institutions."
It is in essence, a World War, currently being
fought with 4th generation
warfare to build a neo-imperial global
government. With overt efforts to destabilize nations around the world,
including Russia and China, the West's hand is revealed and there is no
turning back.
The only hope of stopping disaster if either the corporate-financiers
succeed or fail (thus turning in and feeding on itself), is to recognize
their source of power, and begin undermining it on a daily basis through
both boycotting their goods and services, while simultaneously replacing
their corporations and institutions with local, genuine alternatives.
Syria may seem like an isolated conflict, but is
in reality linked to us directly, regardless of where we live.
Either we live in a nation that will be next, or
a nation who will be further crushed under the hubris, power, and arrogance
of an empowered Wall Street and London elite.
