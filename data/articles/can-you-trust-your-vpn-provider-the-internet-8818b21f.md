The privacy of Internet users has become an
extremely hot topic this year, largely thanks to the revelations of
whistleblower
Edward Snowden. As a result many people
have turned
to VPNs in the hope of making their online
browsing habits harder to track.
While this appears to be a logical move, many
people forget to ask themselves a crucial question:
Can VPN providers be trusted?
Roughly a year ago a new VPN provider entered
the market with a rather generous offer.
The company offered free VPN connections for
all, no strings attached. As a result thousands of people flocked to the
new service and installed the toolbar-supported client in order to be
protected from the prying eyes of their ISP and third-party monitoring
outfits.
While a free VPN does indeed sound like a good
offer, it was surprising to see how easily people were prepared to hook up
to the servers of a totally unknown company.
The VPN service in question, which shall remain
unnamed, was operated by an unknown offshore company that appeared to come
out of nowhere.
The above example is not limited to free or new
VPN providers.
Everyone who uses a VPN service puts an
incredible amount of trust in the company they sign up with. While the
highest encryption standards offer protection against direct monitoring, VPN
providers can still see everything you do, if they want to.
So how do you know if you can trust your
provider?
The honest answer is that you dont.
Earlier this year we published an overview of
several
VPN providers who keep no logs at all.
These sound like a great and safe option, but then again, you have to trust
the answers they provided.
Perhaps its a disappointing conclusion, but
despite all the state of the art encryptions these VPN companies offer,
complete security remains a matter of trust. In reality this means that you
have to carefully vet the VPN service you sign up with, asking yourself
whether you really trust company X with all your data.
For an industry thats worth hundreds of
millions of dollars a year it is quite a surprise that these concerns
havent been addressed more systematically. But perhaps this may change in
the future.
TorrentFreak talked to several providers about
the idea of setting up an independent foundation to do regular audits on
a variety of security aspects. Nearly all providers welcomed such an
initiative and would happily pay to be screened.
The screenings could range from an inspection of
their privacy policies, through to an independent review of the technical
backend, to a complete audit of the company structure. These audits are
already
commonplace for credit card processors
and would help to build trust in the VPN industry.
Of course these audits are no guarantee against
companies changing their policies afterwards, but its a huge improvement
over the complete absence of objective information there is now.
For now, however, we are not aware of any
concrete plans to start up an independent audit foundation.
