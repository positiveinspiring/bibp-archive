Libya's new
'pro-Western' leaders
Among the many comments we have read and
received on the alleged death of Gaddafi, the one most often repeated goes
something like this:
'Gaddafi was a brutal dictator who deserved what he
got'.
The widely-held belief (at least in Western nations) that Gaddafi was
a 'brutal dictator' is the result of over 30 years of (primarily) US,
British and French propaganda against the former Libyan leader.
The reasons
for this long-running propaganda campaign are many, but chief among them is
the fact that Gaddafi was not only fiercely independent as regards his
native land, but he persistently sought to bring financial independence to
other African nations.
It's The Media Stupid!
The average person in the street seems to find it difficult to grasp the
idea that the 'national interests' of democratic governments often run
counter to democratic ideals and that, in pursuing such interests,
governments will attempt to maintain the appearance of remaining faithful to
democratic ideals.
Another way to say this is that governments will lie
about their undemocratic activities in order to maintain a facade of
democracy and thereby avoid disturbing the population. (For those who may
have, understandably, forgotten the core democratic principles,
check this
link for a short refresher course.)
The maintenance of a democratic fa√ßade while pursuing undemocratic
'interests' is today only possible with the committed and almost unanimous
connivance of the mainstream media, which unfailingly disseminates
government propaganda to the people, and which the people in turn accept as
gospel truth in the belief that the press is free and independent of
government control.
But virtually
all Western mainstream media outlets today
are
owned by a handful of powerful corporations and mega-wealthy individuals
who count high level members of Western governments among their close
friends and confidants.
The truth of this can easily be verified by anyone
with a computer and a little time to do some research of their own.
The
extent of the actual freedom of the 'free press' can also be ascertained by
revisiting the way in which the Western media blindly accepted and reported
as truth government lies prior to and after the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
It
is reasonable then to conclude that the Western media, by and large, acts as
a 'Ministry of Propaganda' for Western governments, especially in situations
where government(s) are pursuing policies that are at variance with
democratic ideals.
So, in light of all that, let's consider the question:
"was Gaddafi really a
'brutal dictator'?"
Gaddafi's Real
"Crimes"
Gaddafi with Mandela
Throughout his reign, Gaddafi insisted on a much larger (and fairer) share
of his country's oil profits than multinational oil companies were used to
accepting.
Indeed, in a 2009 talk given to students at Georgetown
University, Gaddafi threatened to
kick Western oil companies out of Libya
altogether by nationalizing its oil and natural gas.
What is beyond dispute
is that Gaddafi used his nation's oil wealth to turn Libya into the most
progressive and modern of all African nations.
In a 2007 African executive
magazine it was
noted that Libya,
"unlike other oil producing countries such
as Nigeria [where major Western oil companies have a stranglehold on the
government], utilized the revenue from its oil to develop its country."
Throughout most of Gaddafi's rule, Libyan citizens enjoyed free health care,
free education and free electricity and water.
Car purchases for every
citizen were 50% subsidized by the government. Gas in Gaddafi's Libya was
$0.14 per liter. Under this 'brutal dictator', the mother of every newborn
child received $5,000.
All these, and many other social benefits under
Gaddafi, make the supposedly socialist systems of France and other European
nations look like predatory capitalist regimes.
Today, with Gaddafi gone,
Libya's generous social benefits and the formerly high standard of living of
its citizens are under serious threat from the new pro-Western puppet
regime.
Gaddafi was also instrumental in establishing the African Union. He
invested
heavily and generously, to the tune of $6 billion, in many other African
nations. Throughout Africa, hospitals, schools, hotels and roads bear
Gaddafi's name as a sign of gratitude to the 'brutal dictator'. Libyan
investments have helped to
connect most of Africa by telephone, television,
radio broadcasting, etc.
Many major African companies, in which Gaddafi had
invested via the 'Libya Arab Africa Investment Portfolio', now face
financial ruin as Libyan oil money is diverted to the West under Libya's new
rulers.
But undoubtedly the greatest threat posed by Gaddafi to NATO warmongers was
his efforts to fast-track the creation of an African Monetary Fund and an
African Central Bank and to establish the gold dinar as a pan-African
currency (Libya has 144 tons of gold with a population of jut 6 million, no
external debt and $150 billion in cash reserves).
Gaddafi's idea was that
African and Muslim nations would join together to create this new currency
and use it to purchase oil and other resources to the exclusion of the
dollar and other currencies.
While a Russia Today report (below video) called it,
"an idea
that would shift the economic balance of the world",
...Gaddafi's plans for a
radical financial overhaul of African economies would undoubtedly have
sounded the death knell for IMF looting of African economies, not to mention
the 'CFA Franc', a colonial currency tied to the Euro and the French central
bank and used in twelve formerly French-ruled African countries (hence the
unbridled enthusiasm with which the French government joined the fray).
Peace Maker
Writing in April 2011 for the London Evening Post, writer Jean-Paul Pougala
had this to say about Gaddafi:
"For most Africans, Gaddafi is a generous man, a humanist, known for his
unselfish support for the struggle against the racist regime in South
Africa.
If he had been an egotist, he wouldn't have risked the wrath of the
West to help the ANC both militarily and financially in the fight against
apartheid. This was why Mandela, soon after his release from 27 years in
jail, decided to break the UN embargo and travel to Libya on 23 October
1997.
Mandela didn't mince his words when the former US president Bill
Clinton said the visit was an 'unwelcome' one:
"No country can claim to be
the policeman of the world and no state can dictate to another what it
should do."
He added,
"Those that yesterday were friends of our enemies have
the gall today to tell me not to visit my brother Gaddafi, they are advising
us to be ungrateful and forget our friends of the past."
A "generous humanist"? Dare we say a genuine socialist?
The late African
freedom fighter, Kwame Ture, further characterized Gaddafi as 'a diamond in
a cesspool of African misleaders'. "African misleaders"
installed and
financed by Western governments.
Writing in September this year in the Guardian, Julian Borger and Terry
Macalister
pointed out that Western oil companies had planned to carve up
Libyan oil before the so-called 'revolution'.
Are we surprised? Is it mere
coincidence that the
NATO bombing campaign began on the 8th anniversary of
the invasion of Iraq?
The Egyptian uprising was more or less legitimate
based on the psychopathic policies of a real 'brutal dictator' - Hosni
Mubarak - who had brought millions of Egyptians to the brink of starvation.
And take note how Mubarak was dealt with in comparison to Gaddafi. But no
such conditions existed in socialist Libya.
The plain truth is that there was no widespread popular revolution against
Gaddafi; there were only ever
hired mercenaries, a well-orchestrated
Western
media campaign, which played out a script dictated to it from start to
finish, heavy infiltration by
military intelligence agents of the US and
European countries, and NATO bombs.
Lots of NATO bombs...
Media War Lies
Perhaps all of this helps us to understand why, in July this year,
huge
crowds of Libyans thronged the streets of Tripoli in support of Gaddafi and
why recent polls suggested that 90% of the Libyan population supported their
'brutal dictator'.
Perhaps we can also understand why images such as the one
below are being touted by the Western media as 'crowds of Libyans queuing to
'gawp' at the 'brutal dictator's dead body':
Not very convincing 'crowd'
queues to see the 'brutal dictator's body
See
here for more 'crowd' pictures.
It should come as no surprise then to realize that allegations of 'war
crimes' leveled at pro-Gaddafi forces and that Gaddafi "bombed his own
people" during the NATO bombing campaign were simply a continuation of the
decades-long demonization of the Libyan Leader, and were designed to cover
up the fact that, just as we saw during the prelude to the 'humanitarian war
to save Kosovars' in 1999 (when "tremendous efforts were undertaken to
discover evidence of war crimes"), it was NATO bombs which
took the lives of
thousands of Libyan civilians.
During a
bombing raid on 30 April, Gaddafi's
son, Saif el-Arab, 29, as well as three of his grandchildren, were killed.
The four-month-old daughter of Gaddafi's daughter Aisha was among those
murdered.
Down The Rat Hole
Was it really Colonel Muammar Gaddafi who was dragged out of that 'rat
hole'?
The story of Gaddafi's 'death' strikes me as a little too
similar to
that of Saddam Hussein (pulled from a 'spider hole', 'hiding like a rat',
etc.) and the images and videos that are doing the rounds on the mainstream
media sites are far too grainy to be proof of anything.
At least one of them
(below) is clearly a doctored version of an image purportedly taken at the
site of Osama Bin Laden's death, which in itself could be taken as evidence
that the same people were involved in both staged events.
Look at 'Gaddafi's' left shoulder.
The pictures
of the dead men at 'Bin Laden's compound' contained one of a man with a toy
'water gun' beneath him. The gun was bright green, the blood was dark red,
and the man wore a white shirt and had dark black hair. He also had one hand
across his chest.
Here's the original:
D√©ja vu
Look familiar?
The CIA photoshopper simply
flipped the image and put Gaddafi's face on it. The water gun was moved
slightly so that the orange on the gun is no longer visible. (Hat-tip to
Pundit Press for pointing this out.)
The real Muammar al-Gaddafi has some rather distinctive facial features:
Note the 'drooping eyelids'
and wrinkle lines
One distinctive feature is
ptosis.
Also called
'drooping eyelid', ptosis is caused by weakness of the muscle responsible
for raising the eyelid, damage to the nerves that control those muscles, or
looseness of the skin of the upper eyelids.
Whether a genetic trait or a
result of aging or plastic surgery, Gaddafi had it. The other distinctive
feature is some marked 'wrinkles' extending diagonally from the corner of
his eyes across his cheek-bones. Check any images of the 'brutal dictator'
from the past few years and you'll see these prominent lines in every image.
Now, check out the 'dead Gaddafi':
What happened to the
'drooping eyelids' and the wrinkle lines?
Same man?
In public appearances over the past few years, Gaddafi appeared with a
respectable head of hair for a man his age.
Here he is with Berlusconi in 2009:
And another image taken during the same year:
While we were unable to find any images of the
back of Gaddafi's head, we think the above two provide a decent enough view
to conclude that he had a significant amount of hair covering his whole head
(marked receding on the front sides notwithstanding).
Compare the above
images with a still from the 'capture video' showing the top of the head of
the man who was dragged out of the 'rat hole':
Thinning on top - 'rat-hole
Gaddafi'
Granted, in the first images of Gaddafi above,
he could well be wearing a wig or hair-piece.
Curiously enough, the
Washington Post
went out of its way to explain that DNA tests conducted by
Libyan doctors on the man they pulled out of the 'rat-hole' confirmed that
the hair on his head was not Moammar Gaddafi's because the unlucky stooge
was wearing a wig.
What are we supposed to believe here? That they ran
identity-verification tests on a wig?! Are they that stupid? Hardly.
It's
more likely that they ran tests on real hair because clearly 'rat hole
Gaddafi' DID have some hair. But when there was no match, the wig was set up
to take the blame.
What else are we to conclude from the comment in the
Washington Post that "the hair was not Moammar Gaddafi's" other than the man
pulled from the rat hole was not Muammar Gaddafi?
Decades of Lies
We're still eagerly awaiting the scenes of mass jubilation among Libyan
citizens at the alleged demise of their 'brutal dictator'.
We suppose it
might take a while to convince the
90% of the Libyan population which
supports Gaddafi that a Western puppet government and economic occupation by
Western corporations is actually a good thing.
The statements made by Western leaders about Gaddafi's 'crimes' as they
gloated over the brutal televised murder of some poor unfortunate in Libya
were revolting, to me anyway.
British Prime Minister David Cameron said that October 20th was:
"a day to remember all of Gaddafi's victims, from those who died in
connection with the Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, to Yvonne Fletcher in a
London Street, and obviously all of the victims of IRA terrorism who died
through their use of Libyan Semtex. We should also remember the many many
Libyans who died at the hands of this brutal dictator and his regime."
Omitted from the end of Cameron's statement was
'and we should also remember
that I'm lying through my teeth.'
Of course, British tabloids like
The Sun, are only too happy to parrot
Cameron's nonsense in typically jingoistic fashion:
But let's have a quick review of 'Gaddafi's
crimes' as reported by Cameron.
-
The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie
Scotland
This was clearly a false-flag operation
designed to demonize Libya. See the
website of the father of one of
the victims, Dr. Jim Swire, for the evidence. Libya has never
accepted responsibility for the bombing of Flight 103, but instead
paid compensation to the families to "buy peace" i.e. attempted
reintegration into the Western elite.
-
The murder of Police Constable Yvonne Fletcher in
St. James' Square, London, in April 1984
Blamed on Libya, there is in fact a
wealth of evidence to support the theory that Fletcher was shot by a
CIA/MI6 operative in an effort to, again, demonize Libya. Despite
the fact that a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary spelled it out in
scientific detail, Cameron is happy to propagate the lie.
-
The 'victims of IRA terrorism' through the use of
Libyan Semtex
There is little doubt that, on a few
occasions, the IRA leadership successfully bought Libyan weapons.
There is also little doubt, however, that all alleged major IRA
attacks which involved the death of civilians were the work of
British intelligence.
The British media's mendacity and
complicity in this lie was further exposed in September this year
when it was revealed that a major British media network had
taken
CGI video footage from a violent computer game and passed it off as
real video footage in an effort to portray Gaddafi as a supporter of
terrorists:
¬© ITV/MI5
The British network claimed it was "human error" that led to a scene from a
computer game
having "IRA film 1988" pasted on it as the narrator worked
through a list of
the past (non-existent) sins of Gaddafi for the British
audience in September this year.
Also consider the following interesting link
between alleged IRA attacks and the Lockerbie bombing.
During the 1970s and early 1980s, one Dr. Thomas
Hayes progressed to become Head of Department at the British Royal Armaments
Research Establishment (RARDE).
His testimony was central to the bogus
Lockerbie verdict. A Parliamentary inquiry into the 1974 alleged IRA
'Maguire Seven' bombing and mistrial discovered that key forensic evidence
indicated the innocence of the accused.
This evidence, which
was known to Dr. Hayes and
two RARDE colleagues, was not disclosed at the Maguire Seven trial. The
Maguire Seven were eventually freed on appeal after spending fifteen years
in jail.
That just gives you some small insight into the lengths to which Western
governments and 'intelligence agencies' have gone (and are prepared to go)
to 'protect their interests'.
With
the mainstream media bought and paid for,
global, corporate, fascist domination is a done deal unless we all wake up
to the reality of the situation and start calling it for what it is -
bullshit, through and through.
So yeah,
-
Cameron et al gloating and lying to the
cameras
-
Hilary Clinton
just happening to be in
Libya a few days ago and demanding Gaddafi 'dead or alive' one day
before someone looking a bit like him is produced from a 'rat-hole'
and then quickly executed and (soon to be) buried in a 'secret
location' far from prying eyes
-
the
deliberately conflicting stories of
how he was killed being spread far and wide by the mainstream media
-
Gaddafi being feted (and armed) by
British, French, American, Italian Prime Ministers and Presidents
just a couple of years ago and then suddenly demonized as a 'brutal
dictator' and his country and citizens bombed back to the stone age
- all of that pisses us off
But what really concerns us here is not our own
rising blood pressure, but the future of Libya. Already the vultures are
circling, eying their prize in the form of Libya's natural resources.
Take
it away, French Minister of Defence, G√©rard Longuet:
New Libyan leaders 'owe' France
Agence France-Presse
http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/New-Libyan-leaders-owe-France-20111021
France will seek a leading role in post-war Libya, Defence Minister
Gerard Longuet said on Friday, arguing that Libya's new leaders "owe"
Paris for leading the campaign to oust Muammar Gaddafi.
Speaking in an interview to Le Monde on the day after Libya's ousted
strongman was captured and killed, Longuet said France is poised to take
advantage of its leading role after a successful campaign.
France,
"will strive to play the role of a principal partner in the
country where the leaders know they owe us a lot".
"Everyone will throw their hat into the ring. We will neither be the
last nor the most blatant," he said of Libya's relations with various
Western countries in the coalition.[...]
Libya, which produced 1.6 to 1.7 million barrels of oil daily before the
conflict, is a coveted market for many countries that are also eyeing
potentially massive contracts for rebuilding its infrastructure.
Ah yes, 'reconstruction', Libyans can kiss
goodbye to the relatively decent standard of living they enjoyed under
Gaddafi.
Just look at post-invasion Iraq:
'reconstruction'
there has left the country
impoverished and in ruins,
looted by the
war-mongers.
I'm a 'Brutal
Dictator', Get Me Out of Here
The bottom line here is that people like Gaddafi do not remain leader of a
major nation for 40+ years without having self-preservation high on their
list of priorities.
The idea that Gaddafi would have waited until he was
dragged from a sewer by a gang of bloodthirsty hoodlums and then beaten and
shot dead is stretching his reputation as a true 'man of the people' a
little far.
Gaddafi's decades of experience gleaned from dealing with and
observing the treachery of 'Western diplomacy', both up close in person and
from afar, would have left him in no doubt as to what lay in store for him
if US-imposed regime change ever came to Libya.
He would also have been
egotistical enough to realize that he would be of better service to his
beloved Libya alive than dead.
We cannot then, at this stage, rule out the possibility that, like Saddam
Hussein, Gaddafi left Libya long before he was forced to resort to martyrdom
in a sewer with only his 'golden gun' between him and a baying mob of paid
CIA killers.
As with the case of Saddam, there is evidence that this is what
happened. As Joe Quinn noted at the time, the death of Saddam Hussein was
more than likely faked. See his article on the
Capture, Trial and Conviction
of Saddam Hussein for evidence that Saddam too was spirited out of the
country long before someone that looked like him was pulled from a
'rat-hole'.
Consider also the very convenient way in which the alleged body
of Gaddafi has
now been secretly buried in an unmarked grave in the desert.
Much like the alleged dumping of the body of Osama bin Laden 'at sea', this
little maneuver stinks of a cover-up.
In attempting to uncover and expose government and media lies, it is often
helpful to consult media reports that were released early on in any major
news event. In a 21
February report, the British Foreign Secretary, William
Hague, was quoted as having said that Gaddafi had already left the country.
Then in August Ynet News
reported that:
"A convoy of six armored vehicles has crossed the Libyan border to Algeria
on Saturday night, the Egyptian news agency reported.
While it is unclear
who was riding in the cars, a rebel forces source estimated that the convoy
transported senior Libyan officials - including the embattled leader,
Muammar Gaddafi."
The report quoted a Libyan military council source as saying that troops
loyal to Gaddafi's regime accompanied the convoy to the border.
In a 24 August IOL News story
we were told:
"Burkina Faso, a former recipient of large amounts of Libyan aid, has
offered Muammar Gaddafi exile but has also recognized the rebel National
Transitional Council (NTC) as Libya's government. "
The modern Libyan city of
Misrata,
before and after NATO and its
mercenaries - NOT Gaddafi,
or "Gaddafi's loyal
supporters" - bombed it back to the stone age.
On 1 September,
Reuters reported that:
"Muammar Gaddafi called Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to negotiate
a passage into his country but the latter refused to take his call."
And then on 11 October, the
Bulawayo News reported that:
"An official on Libya's governing council says he believes Muammar Gaddafi
is hiding in the south-western desert near the borders with Niger and
Algeria."
We submit that the publishing of grisly (and grainy) photos and video of the
alleged death of Gaddafi is not for the benefit of the global public at all
(even though many seem to have relished the lynching).
Rather, it is for the
benefit of the leaders of any other nations who might be thinking about
disobeying the dictates of the US Empire and the World bank.
British deputy
prime minister Nick Clegg seemed to confirm
Joe's earlier thoughts about
this when he declared on 22 October that:
"The death of Muammar Gaddafi sends a huge signal to others in the region
that the sins of grotesque dictators eventually catch up with them."
In making this statement, Clegg has departed from the British government's
original rationale for an attack on Libya - humanitarian intervention - and
has made clear the real reason for the eight month-long bombing of Libya,
its people, and their freedoms - naked, bloody imperialism, launched - quite
coincidentally - on 19 March, the same date as the invasion of Iraq eight
years ago.
Assuming for a moment that that really was Gaddafi they murdered in broad
daylight, then the
unctuous words of British foreign secretary
William
Hague...
"We would have preferred him to be able to
face justice at the International Criminal Court or in a Libyan court
for his crimes. We don't approve of extra-judicial killings,"
...are such fantastical bullshit that we reckon Hague deserves a prize.
If
Gaddafi was in fact executed on October 20th, then Hague and his ilk in the
US and France are undoubtedly delighted.
Gaddafi in the dock at The Hague
was the very last thing any members of the US, British or French criminal
enterprises (aka governments) would have wanted to see, mainly because of
the
large
quantities of
beans he would have spilled.
They didn't want a
rerun of
Slobodan Milosevic's truth-letting tainting their blood-spattered
image as liberators, an embarrassing judicial episode which thankfully, for
NATO governments, came to an abrupt end with the
termination of the former
Serb leader in his jail cell.
As we ponder the dark implications of living in a world where large numbers
of people rejoice at gruesome stage shows of death and merrily embrace the
murder of decent men, we'll leave you with the final, disgusting words of
the clearly psychopathic...
Hillary Clinton:
