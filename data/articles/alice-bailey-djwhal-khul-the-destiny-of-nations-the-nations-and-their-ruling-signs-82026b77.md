Ruling Signs

The Nations and their Ruling SignsIt
is, however, obvious that nations react like human beings under the influence of their
rays - personality and soul rays - and this is a fact of vital import to the esotericist
and something as yet little known or intelligently realized. What I give you, therefore,
under this point is new exoterically; attention will have to be paid to the information -
either as it comes from me or from other sources - if there is to be real understanding of
the situation and therefore useful cooperation with the Forces of Light.
I will give you here the present personality influences of the nations,
indicated by their governing signs of the zodiac, trusting that you will give due thought
to what I impart and assuring you that they are of vital significance at this time,
particularly if you compare them with what I gave you anent the rays of the nations in the
first volume of A Treatise on the Seven Rays. I would remind you that - over
the lapse of centuries - nations are reborn several times or come into incarnation in a
new form which we may call a period, if unimportant, or a civilization if significant and
dramatic enough. Therefore, the personality ray and the governing influences change with
frequency. This is oft forgotten, because the cycles are so much vaster than those of
human incarnation. I would also point out that the tabulations which follow agree in part
with the ordinary accepted assignment of zodiacal signs to the various countries, but not
always. I will give you two signs for each country. One will be the emerging influence
which will govern the ego or the soul of the country or nation, and the other that which
governs at the present moment the personality ray of the individual country, and so
conditions the masses. Forget not that the soul of the people is represented by those who
[68] react to the influence of the soul ray and of the sign which is affecting it (its
ascendant, one might say), whilst the masses are conditioned by the personality ray and
therefore by the sun sign of the specified nation.
