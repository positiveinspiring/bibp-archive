The Great Invocation - Stanza ThreeApril
17, 1945
As this world catastrophe draws to its inevitable close and the Forces of Light triumph
over the forces of evil, the time of restoration opens up. For each of you this indicates
a renewed time of service and of activity. I send you herewith the final Stanza of the
Great Invocation, as I promised. (Reprinted from Discipleship in the New Age,
Vol. II. Pages 148-151, to preserve the historical sequence of the issuing of the three
Stanzas of the Great Invocation). I gave you the first about nine years ago and the second
during the course of the war. I would ask you to use it daily and as many times a day as
you can remember to do so; you will thus create a seed thought or a clear-cut thought-form
which will make the launching of this Invocation among the masses of men a successful
venture when the right time comes. That time is not yet.
This Great Invocation can be expressed in the following words:
From the point of Light within the Mind of God
Let light stream forth into the minds of men.
Let Light descend on Earth.
From the point of Love within the Heart of God
Let love stream forth into the hearts of men.
May Christ return to Earth.
From the center where the Will of God is known
Let purpose guide the little wills of men -
The purpose which the Masters know and serve.
From the center which we call the race of men
Let the Plan of Love and Light work out
And may it seal the door where evil dwells.
Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth. [489]
It has been difficult to translate into understandable and adequate phrases, the very
ancient word-forms which the Christ will employ. These word-forms are only seven in
number, and they will constitute His complete, new utterance. I have only been able to
give their general significance. Nothing else was possible, but even in this longer form,
they will be potent in their invocative appeal, if said with mental intensity and
ardent purpose. The points of emphasis upon which I would ask you to dwell (once it is
permissible to use the phrases) are two in number:
1. May Christ return to earth. This return must not be understood in its
usual connotation and its well-known mystical, Christian sense. Christ has never left the
earth. What is referred to is the externalization of the Hierarchy and its exoteric
appearance on earth. The Hierarchy will eventually, under its Head, the Christ, function
openly and visibly on earth. This will happen when the purpose of the divine will and the
plan which will implement it is better understood and the period of adjustment, of world
enlightenment and of reconstruction has made real headway. This period begins at the San
Francisco Conference (hence its major importance) and will move very slowly at first. It
will take time but the Hierarchy thinks not in terms of years and of brief cycles (though
long to humanity), but in terms of events and the expansion of consciousness.
2. May it seal the door where evil dwells. The sealing up of the evil forces,
released during this war, will take place within the immediate future. It will be soon.
The evil referred to has nothing to do with the evil inclinations, the selfish instincts
and the separativeness found in the hearts and minds of human beings. These they must
overcome and eliminate for themselves. But the reduction to impotency of the loosed forces
of evil which took advantage of the world situation, which obsessed the German people and
directed the Japanese people, and which worked through barbarity, murder, sadism, lying
propaganda and which prostituted science to achieve their ends, requires the imposition
[490] of a power beyond the human. This must be invoked and the invocation will meet with
speedy response. These evil potencies will be occultly "sealed" within their own
place; what this exactly means has naught to do with humanity. Men today must learn the
lessons of the past, profit from the discipline of the war and deal - each in his own life
and community - with the weaknesses and errors to which he may find himself prone.
I would
here recall to you what I said last year anent this final Stanza of the Invocation.
I am preparing to present to you for wide distribution throughout the world, the last
stanza of the Great Invocation. It is by no means easy to translate the words of this
stanza in terms which will make it of general appeal and not simply of importance to
convinced esotericists...It can be so presented that the masses everywhere, the general
public will be prompted to take it up and will use it widely; they will do this on a
relatively larger scale than the intuitional, the spiritually minded or even the men of
goodwill. A far wider public will comprehend it. I will give A.A.B. this stanza at the
earliest possible moment; this will be conditioned by world affairs and by my
understanding of a certain esoteric appropriateness in the setting of a time cycle. If
plans mature as desired by the Hierarchy, the new stanza can receive distribution at the
time of the Full Moon of June 1945, as far as the Occident is concerned, and considerably
later for the Orient. Prior to these set points in time, the stanza can be used by all
esoteric school members, after being used for one clear month by my group, dating that
month from the time that the most distant members of the group receive it.
I seek to have this Invocation go forth on the power generated by my Ashram and by all
of you affiliated with my Ashram; the Ashrams of the Master K.H. and the Master M. are
likewise deeply committed to participation in this work. [491]
