# Netanyahu Shape-Shifts Iran Reality

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/esp_sociopol_zion111.htm

When Israel's Prime
Minister Netanyahu visits Washington,
he behaves
like the master of all he surveys,
his arrogance
extending to his shape-shifting reality about
Iran,
with expectations of hearty applause
for
his claims and robust guffawing at his
jokes,
ex-CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar notes.
Benjamin Netanyahu's tiresome
vilification of Iran has taken on the characteristics of a rote
obsession that diverges farther and farther from truth, reality and
his own ostensible objective.
It is as if - in pursuing his real
objective of keeping Iran ostracized, preventing any U.S. agreements
with it, and keeping the specter of an Iranian threat permanently
overshadowing everything else he'd rather not talk about - he has
been reduced to a ritual, repetitive chant of "Iran bad, very bad"
and does not care whether or not reflection on what he is saying
shows it to make any sense.
Outside of the anti-Americanism that is
heard so widely and often, it is hard to think of any other leader
or government so dedicated to heaping calumnies unceasingly on
another nation, at least one not currently waging war on the
heaper's country.
Maybe some American Cold Warriors
fixated on the Evil Empire came close.
Attacks on Iran occupied most of the
first half of Netanyahu's speech Tuesday to
AIPAC.
Haaretz accompanied a
transcript of the speech with one of those graphics depicting
the frequency with which particular words have been used. For the
entire speech Iran was mentioned far more than any word
other than Israel.
Maybe the relentlessness of this latest
iteration of the chant reflects Netanyahu's frustration over his
recent failure to get the U.S. Congress to sabotage the nuclear
negotiations with Iran by slapping on new, deal-breaking sanctions.
Perhaps he also felt a need to amp up
the attacks to bring attention back to the Iranian specter from the
crisis in Ukraine.
Falsehoods continue to flow out of
Netanyahu's mouth on this subject. Maybe the technique of getting
people to believe something if it is repeated often enough is
working, as reflected by some of the same falsehoods coming out of
the mouths of members of Congress.
He referred, for example, to the need
for pressure to get Iranians to,
"abandon their nuclear weapons
program."
No:
according to the U.S. intelligence community, Iran has not
decided to build a nuclear weapon, and Israeli intelligence does not
disagree.
Netanyahu said that,
"Iran openly calls for our [i.e.,
Israel's] destruction."
No: the former Iranian president who
once made a metaphorical statement that got mis-translated into
something along that line isn't even around any more.
Actually,
the current Iranian government says if the Palestinian problem
is resolved then it would be possible for Iran to extend formal
recognition to the state of Israel.
Netanyahu asserted that Iran,
"continues to build ICBMs."
No:
there is no evidence that Iran is building ICBMs or even
intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Iran does have medium range
ballistic missiles, but testing and development even of those has
been quiescent lately.
In an opening sequence in the speech in
which Netanyahu referred to medical and other humanitarian aid that
Israel furnishes overseas, he said that Iran doesn't do any such
thing because,
"the only thing that Iran sends
abroad are rockets, terrorists and missiles to murder, maim and
menace the innocent."
No: actually
Iran does provide medical and similar humanitarian aid.
The prime minister's analytical
assertions are similarly divorced from reality. In arguing for the
deal-breaking, impossible-to-achieve objective of no Iranian
enrichment of uranium, he said that,
"letting Iran enrich uranium would
open up the floodgates" of "nuclear proliferation in the Middle
East and around the world."
But Iran already has been enriching
uranium for some time, and no floodgates have opened.
Even if Iran, contrary to its current
policy, were to build a nuclear weapon,
they still would be unlikely to open.
Netanyahu seemed to dare us not to take
him seriously when, in a jarringly discordant note alongside all of
the alarmism about a supposedly deadly and dire threat, he tried to
crack a joke to accompany his falsehood about ICBMs:
"You remember that beer commercial,
this Bud's for you'? Well, when you see Iran building ICBMs,
just remember, America, that Scud's for you."
Hardy har har.
Glaringly absent from the tirade was any
of the perspective of a person living in a glass house who should be
careful about not throwing stones.
For example, along with
self-congratulation for medical aid Netanyahu said Israel has
provided Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, there was no mention of
the misery that Israel has inflicted on people living in the same
territory through a suffocating blockade and military-inflicted
destruction.
And alongside all of the alarums about a
possible Iranian nuclear weapon there was of course no mention of
Israel having the only nuclear weapons in the Middle East, totally
outside any international control regime and with their existence
not even admitted.
Nor was there any real application of
logic to implications for policy, given that the most important
policy fixture at the moment is the nuclear negotiation.
If
Netanyahu's objective really were to assure prevention of an Iranian
nuke - rather than assuring persistence of the issue of a
possible Iranian nuke - the conclusion would be to support the
negotiations rather than to try to sabotage them.
Even if one believed all the calumnies,
they are either irrelevant to the nuclear talks or all the more
reason to hope they succeed.
Listening to a speech such as this, it
is a wonder that many Israelis condone a leader who is offering his
country unending conflict and confrontation. And it is a wonder that
many Americans, including ones with admiration and fondness for
Israel, are influenced by him.
He is not acting in the best
interests of the state they admire and love, let along in the
interests of the United States. The reciter of the primitive chants of
hate against Iran has a narrower objective.
As Henry Siegman
observes,
"To say that Netanyahu is not a
visionary leader is an understatement. To be sure, he is a clever tactician
who knows how to stay in office.
That goal, which he believes is
unbreakably linked to retaining his leadership of Israel's
political right wing, trumps every other domestic and
international challenge that faces Israel."
