The newest round of
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations begin today in Salt Lake
City, Utah, where trade representatives will work towards finalizing the
text of this sprawling secret agreement.
Last week's publication of the
controversial
"Intellectual Property" chapter by Wikileaks confirmed our worst fears:
the TPP carries draconian copyright enforcement provisions that threaten
users' rights and could stifle innovation well into the 21st Century.
Public opposition to the TPP continues to grow
as a result of the leaked document; an opaque policymaking process that
seems geared towards appeasing Big Content does not provide much in the way
of legitimacy.
In the past week,
23 Republicans and 151 Democrats in
the House of Representatives wrote letters to the Obama administration
indicating their unwillingness to comply with the Executive's request for
power to fast-track trade agreements through Congress.
Fast-track authority, also known as Trade Promotion Authority, limits
congressional approval over trade agreements to a yes or no, up or down
vote. If a bill granting fast-track were to pass, hearings would become
extremely limited, and lawmakers would have no ability to make amendments.
It would give the Obama administration unchecked
power to shape TPP and other agreements like the EU-U.S. trade deal, the
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
(T-TIP).
There are
some
Congress members who are actively pushing for fast-track and are vowing
to introduce legislation to enact it by 2014.
Thankfully, these letters from
the House show the White House is going to have difficulty in finding
support in Congress to pass such a bill. Still,
the Obama administration is
going to push hard for the passage of fast-track.
The U.S. trade office is negotiating TPP as if
it already has fast-track authority, by deciding for itself which countries
to negotiate with and what issues are on the table.
Without fast-track, it's inconceivable that the
TPP would survive congressional debate.
And that's the point of all of this secrecy:
the TPP's myriad harmful provisions for
users wouldn't survive the sunlight of transparency, so it's being
negotiated in the dark.
And since negotiators only get to hear
corporations' concerns while drafting these policies, it only makes sense
that its agenda would exclude users' interests.
So we need to demand that our lawmakers oppose
fast-track. Let's ask them to call for a hearing and exercise their
authority to oversee the U.S. trade offices secret copyright agenda.
