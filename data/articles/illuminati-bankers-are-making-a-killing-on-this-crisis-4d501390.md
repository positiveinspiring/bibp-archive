The price tag for bailing out the US financial
system may exceed $1.3 trillion dollars.
The purchase price for the mortgage lenders, Bear Stearns and AIG is over
$300 billion. Now the assumption of the bad loans held by the banks may cost
an additional trillion dollars. (Paulson
Plan Could Cost $1 Trillion)
If the US Treasury created its own money, this might be bearable. But last I
heard the system of money creation has not changed. I'm not an economist but
it seems that the Fed is making a killing on our banking woes. The Fed is
creating this "money" out of thin air and using it to buy US Treasury Notes
and Bonds. The Treasury (i.e. US taxpayer) are on the hook for these
securities plus interest.
So while it looks like the Fed is riding to our rescue, in fact it is doing
a very brisk business. And the US is falling so far into "debt" that
political independence is a thing of the past.
The central bankers appear to be trying to fend off a Depression. Perhaps
they want to postpone the financial breakdown for reasons of their own. As a
friend said, "I guess they want their shit bomb to explode after the
election."
If we see the Treasury as merely a front for the Fed, then the country seems
to be increasingly owned by a foreign central banking cartel. They will own
all those houses at bargain prices. A form of Communism (i.e. state
ownership) is being created in response to a manufactured crisis.
Formally the assets will be owned by the state,
but who controls the state?
SVALI
At this time, it is important to be aware that
an illuminati defector
known as "Svali"
said she was taught that the "end of the world" scenario involved an
economic collapse. Remember the Illuminati is a Masonic cult founded and
funded by the central bankers who own the Fed.
Here is her full testimony given about ten
year ago.
"Want to hear the end of the world scenario
the Illuminati taught me? It was cult propaganda, but this is how they
believed the
New Order would be ushered in:
There will be continued conflict in the Mideast, with a severe threat of
nuclear war being the culmination of these hostilities. An economic
collapse that will devastate the economy of the US and Europe, much like
the great depression.
One reason that our economy continues limping along is the artificial
supports that the Federal Reserve had given it, manipulating interest
rates, etc. But one day, this won't work (or this leverage will be
withdrawn on purpose) and the next great depression will hit.
The government will call in its bonds and loans, and credit card debts
will be called in. There will be massive bankruptcies nationwide. Europe
will stabilize first, and Germany, France and England (surprise) will
have the strongest economies, and will institute through the UN an
international currency. Japan will also pull out, although their economy
will be weakened.
Peacekeeping forces will be sent out by the UN and local bases to
prevent riots. The leaders will reveal themselves, and people will be
asked to make a pledge of loyalty during a time of chaos and financial
devastation.
Doesn't sound pleasant, does it?
I don't know the exact time frame for all of
this, and wouldn't want to even guess. The good news is that if a person
is debt-free, owes nothing to the government or credit debt, and can
live self sufficiently, they may do better than others. I would invest
in gold, not stocks, if I had the income. Gold will once again be the
world standard, and dollars will be pretty useless. Remember after the
Civil War? Our money will be worth about what confederate money was
after the collapse.
All this said, it could just be cult propaganda taught to me and others
to frighten us. It may be that none of this will happen. I sincerely
hope not. I also strongly believe that God is able to stay the
hand of the wicked, and to take care of our nation and others, if we
turn to Him."
CONCLUSION
That noted, let's remember the words of Denis Healey, former
British Defense Secretary and Secretary of the Exchequer:
"World events do not occur by accident: They
are made to happen, whether it is to do with national issues or
commerce; and most of them are staged and managed by those who hold the
purse strings."
I think we are in for a recession, maybe even a
Depression but I don't think the Illuminati is ready to declare their
New World Order just yet. However, this could be part of a larger scenario
leading to
World War Three, similar to the role
the Great Depression played as a precursor to World War Two.
The Illuminati goal is to torture the human race until we cry out to them
for world government, anything to stop the pain.
