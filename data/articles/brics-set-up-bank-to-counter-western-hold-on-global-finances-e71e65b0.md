Leaders of the BRICS emerging market nations
launched a $100 billion development bank and a currency reserve pool on
Tuesday in their first concrete step toward reshaping the Western-dominated
international financial system.
The bank aimed at funding infrastructure projects in developing nations will
be based in Shanghai and India will preside over its operations for the
first five years, followed by Brazil and then Russia, leaders of the
five-country group announced at a summit.
They also set up a $100 billion currency reserves pool to help countries
forestall short-term liquidity pressures.
The long-awaited bank is the first major achievement of the BRICS countries
- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - since they got together in
2009 to press for a bigger say in the global financial order created by
Western powers after World War Two and centered on
the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
The BRICS were prompted to seek coordinated action following an exodus of
capital from emerging markets last year, triggered by the scaling back of
U.S. monetary stimulus.
The new bank reflects the growing influence of
the BRICS, which account for almost half the world's population and about
one-fifth of global economic output.
The bank will begin with a subscribed capital of
$50 billion divided equally between its five founders, with an initial total
of $10 billion in cash put in over seven years and $40 billion in
guarantees.
It is scheduled to start lending in 2016 and be
open to membership by other countries, but the capital share of the BRICS
cannot drop below 55 percent. The contingency currency pool will be held in
the reserves of each BRICS country and can be shifted to another member to
cushion balance-of-payments difficulties.
This initiative gathered momentum after the
reverse in the flows of cheap dollars that fueled a boom in emerging markets
for a decade.
"It will help contain the volatility faced
by diverse economies as a result of the tapering of the United States'
policy of monetary expansion," Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said.
"It is a sign of the times, which demand reform of the IMF," she told
reporters at the close of the summit.
China, holder of the world's largest foreign
exchange reserves, will contribute the bulk of the contingency currency
pool, or $41 billion.
Brazil, India and Russia will chip in $18
billion each and South Africa $5 billion. If a need arises, China will be
eligible to ask for half of its contribution, South Africa for double and
the remaining countries the amount they put in.
Negotiations over the headquarters and first
presidency were reached at the eleventh hour due to differences between
India and China.
The impasse reflected the trouble Brazil,
Russia, India, China and South Africa have had in reconciling stark economic
and political differences that made it hard for the group to turn rhetoric
into concrete action.
"We pulled it off 10 minutes before the end
of the game. We reached a balanced package that is satisfactory to all,"
a Brazilian diplomat told Reuters.
Negotiations to create the bank dragged on for
more than two years as Brazil and India fought China's attempts to get a
bigger share in the lender than the others.
In the end, Brazil and India prevailed in keeping equal equity at its
launch, but fears linger that China, the world's No. 2 economy, could try to
assert greater influence over the bank to expand its political clout abroad.
China, however, will not preside over the bank
for two decades.
Facing efforts by leading Western nations to isolate Russia for annexing
Crimea and stirring revolt in eastern Ukraine, the BRICS summit
provided President Vladimir Putin with a welcome geopolitical
platform to show he has friends elsewhere, economic powers seen as shaping
the future of the world.
The BRICS abstained from criticizing Russia over
the crisis in Ukraine and called instead for restraint by all actors so
the conflict can be resolved peacefully.
