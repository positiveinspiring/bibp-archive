Filmed with the startling immediacy of unfolding history,
Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker
Alex Gibney's 'We Steal Secrets : The Story of WikiLeaks'
details the creation of Julian Assange's controversial website,
which facilitated the largest security breach in U.S. history.
Hailed by some as a free-speech hero
and by others as a traitor and terrorist,
the enigmatic Assange's rise and fall are paralleled with that
of Pfc. Bradley Manning, the brilliant, troubled young soldier
who downloaded hundreds of thousands of documents
from classified U.S. military and diplomatic servers,
revealing the behind-the-scenes workings of
the government's international diplomacy and military strategy.
In seeking to expose abuse in the corridors of power,
Assange and Manning were undermined by forces
within and without, as well as by their own human failings.
We Steal Secrets : The Story of WikiLeaks is a riveting,
multi-layered tale about transparency in the information age
and our ever-elusive search for the truth.
