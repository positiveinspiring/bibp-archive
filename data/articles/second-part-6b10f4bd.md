PART 2
HOW HELP COMES ABOUT FOR...
MINDCONTROL VICTIMS
[back]
When our system first began doing collages as therapy, the third collage we
did of our system was this one of the Gems, the Grand Druid Council hierarchy,
the daisy chains and the fairy, and yet it was one of the last to be understood.
When our deeper alters got done with the collage, our front alters didnt
understand what they had done. It took several years to learn what all the
pieces in the collage meant. What the picture shows are the deeper workings of
the system, which are run by early splits. In the background is a veil. In front
of it are gems, and diamonds. There are two kinds of gems. One are the gems
which link to the computers, and the other are the diamonds in the rough, the
clean slate alters which have yet to be programmed. A diamond in the system
(pyramid) acts as a radio crystal to receive direction and energy from Satan.
The energy is then distributed via the crystal and the gems to the system. This
diamond is encapsulated within a gold womb-shaped crystal.
The gems in the system (ruby, diamond, topaz, onyx, emerald, sapphire, opal,
amethyst, obsidian, turquoise, etc.) are linked to the book of Revelations
Heavenly City. The 12 gems send out signals according to their color coding,
which are then transmitted by the correct color of ribbon to the correct colored
coded alters. Their messages, the scripts, are acted out on the stage of life,
which is portrayed behind the erect gold or platinum statue (AntiChrist figure).
Gold represents divinity in the Illuminati. In front of that is the clock with
the hierarchy. The clock is a crystal pyramid representing the pyramid in the
middle of the Grand Druid Council (aka Executive Control Board). Its 12 hours
are the 12 positions of the Grand Druid Council which link to their 12 job
responsibilities or characteristics and the 12 colors. The 13th number is
Satans, and it is color coded platinum. The Grand Druid Council like the
Knights of the Round Table sit around a circular table. The pyramid is meant to
have 13 stairs to it. The daisy chains were used to link our early parts to
their master. Our Daddy would make daisy chains for us.
Most people would never suspect something like this being mind-control
reinforcement. These daisy chains were delicate and very sensitive to touch. We
were not to break or touch the daisy chains. Our internal daisy chains link to
small 3 year old child alters. The daisy chains represent soul ties and the
artificial programmed love they wanted us to have toward our master. A severe
pain in our head, like a hole being drilled into our head, was refrained by the
programmers as being a hole for the sun to shine through to raise daisy flowers
for Daddy. Flowers are important family links in the programming.. The bud
protects a daughter. The root and stem the mother figure. The soil ceremony
protects the grandparents, and is grounded in the earth. The Fairy alters are
involved in the hour glass and are the creative force within the system. Here
Whisper (Tinkerbell figure) sprinkles Star dust on the light side. The yellow
brick road, like a whirlwind that pulls the vehicle, leads to divinity, a mother
goddess figure. A gold crown rests upon this stone statue. A tree runs through
the entire situation. Those who are familiar with the trees in the system,
realize that they are used to hang all the programming. The willow and oak roots
run through the collage. Although it is somewhat difficult to notice, off to the
right side of Satan are 9 chambers, which represent the various chambers on the
Cabalistic tree of life. Interconnected bubbles are interconnected worlds and
galaxies in the system. The numerous butterflies are a ring of light that lay at
the base of the neck.

The Daisy World (previous page)
We have a special world of devotion to our master called the daisy world. An
entire world of alters who love him make up this world. The picture looks some
what reminiscent of some of the Fantasia scenes. The unicorn takes us into this
magic world. The waterfall cleans our minds of the trauma memories.
A BOXED, SINKING DISCOURAGED SENSE ABOUT LIFE. p_box.jpg (next page 318)
One of the traumas is to take a child, put him in a trunk and dump him into
water. The trunk fills up and the child passes out, and then is rescued in the
nick of time before it dies. This is a common programming trauma. It is this
type of trauma that is attached to programming. Feelings come in all shapes and
sizes, and it is O.K. to have feelings. When the system did this an alter wrote,
"The way I feel, locked and sinking, red sails in the moonlight."
The ROLE of a BETA-DELTA TEAM OF ALTERS. p_beta-delta.jpg (overleaf after next
page 319)
The hour glass controls the system. Its balance in relation to the clock and
compass is crucial. The robots stand in military ranks ready to serve their
national leaders. The piano cords at the left are codes for some alters. Maybe
the reader will be able to figure out what some of the images mean on their own.
