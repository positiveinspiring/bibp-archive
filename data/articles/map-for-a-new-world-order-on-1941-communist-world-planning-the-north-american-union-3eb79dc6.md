In October of 1941, before Pearl Harbor, Philadelphia clock-maker Maurice Gomberg completed a communist world map of future regional unions, including a continental North American Union.
The name Canada is not on that map. However, the former provinces are depicted as states, re-federated into a vast "United States of America" stretching to Greenland. Maurice Gomberg sympathized with the Communist Party of America (CPA).
Interestingly, Canada's recent former leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, is a "former" Marxist-Leninist Maoist communist. In April of 2010, Duceppe toured Canada urging ALL the provinces to "secede" and become States. Then, on 30 April 2011, when interviewed on camera by independent Quebec journalist, Éric Granger in Trois-Rivières, Duceppe admitted that what he really wants is "a good treaty like they have in Europe" and a "sovereign" Quebec inside a "North American Union".

A copy was received by the Library of Congress on Feb. 25, 1942, as shown by the stamp. Another stamp suggests it was entered into the map collection on Mar. 31, 1942. A different copy of the same Map, studied by Professor Alexander Gella in London in 1985, bears the stamp COMPLETED - OCT 1941". It was thus compiled and prepared before Pearl Harbor (Dec. 7, 1941).

Note: 1986: « l'État-nation a fait son temps. » «Il lui faudra céder cette portion de ses pouvoirs et de ses ressources à une autorité qui soit un Conseil de Securité pour l'humanité tout entière.» René Lévesque, former leader of the Parti Québécois, who tried to break up Canada in 1980 for "Sovereignty Association" - a new federation to replace Canada, modeled on the EEC/EU, basis and template of One-World Government.
Lévesque's language in 1986 and note Sarkozy's language in 2007 are identical: same club. They are both trying to give effect to The Map.
That's what Canada's phoney Québec secession movement and the FLQ terrorists have really been about.
