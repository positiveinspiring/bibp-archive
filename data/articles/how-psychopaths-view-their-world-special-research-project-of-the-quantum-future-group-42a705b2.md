Most psychopaths are very arrogant and cocky.
However, when charming a
potential victim, they say all the "right" things and make you believe they
are kind-hearted souls; not always, but often enough. The truth is,
psychopaths are not altruistic and do not really care about friendships or
ties.
Guggenbuhl-Craig states that they are
very talented at appearing much more humble than the average person, but are
hardly so. Some are also able to feign concern about the lower classes and
profess that they are on the side of the underdog, the poor, and so forth.
A
psychopath may claim, for instance (if he's from a low socio-economic
class), that he dislikes rich people intensely, but at the same time, he
will inwardly yearn and envy what they have. He is like the narcissist,
desiring to reflect a false image of himself through his possessions.
Among his possessions are included human beings:
girlfriends, wives, and children.
Some psychopaths can even very fond of
animals (contrary to the common viewpoint), but still view them as objects
in relation to themselves.
The psychopath is filled with greed inside, relating to the world through
power, even though, as I said, on the outside he can claim to be on the side
of the disenfranchised or the downtrodden.
I knew one who liked to repeat
phrases such as,
"they have to stop keeping my brothers down" but he didn't
mean a word of it. He was actually a racist.
The psychopath can also often
identify himself as a revolutionary.
On the flip side, the psychopath also often paints a picture of himself as
the downcast anti-hero (his "own worst enemy type") and some like to see
themselves as lone-wolves.
The psychopath may even claim he is sensitive and
profound, but inside he is nothing but emptiness and greed.
Whether or not
the psychopath is aware of his behavior is something that is often debated.
I do believe that psychopaths usually know exactly what they are doing,
although others suggest that psychopaths are "born, not made." [1]
I believe that psychopathy is primarily genetic.
A son with a psychopathic
father often will be psychopathic as well, especially if the father was
abusive and/or abandoned the family as well.
As mentioned, psychopaths often claim to settle for second best (being their
own worst enemy) and then think they deserve better. This may be manifested
in the way they seek power - either through money (i.e. material goods),
manipulation and/or treating people as objects. By enacting such behaviors,
the psychopath is also trying to "get back" at society and the world, in
order to gain retribution.
They will spend their entire lives doing this,
whether they are rich or poor, or whatever their social background may be,
although studies have shown that they often come from an impoverished or
lower socio- economic background and/or social status.
Note: In one of Dr. Donald Black's studies, many of
the men were,
"overwhelmingly white, blue collar,
lower middle class, and married, and most had not graduated from high
school."
[Black, 14]
Let me
add, despite Dr. Blacks' studies, psychopaths can still exist in any social
class. Do not be misled.
I also wanted to point out that I will be using
"he" and "him" for the term psychopath throughout this website; let it not
be forgotten, yes, female psychopaths exist as well; however, according to
the Sixth Edition of
Abnormal Behavior, printed in 2000 by three male
professors, David, Derald, and Stanley Sue, the rates do differ by gender.
Included in their excellent text is a report by the The American Psychiatric
Association that the general estimate is 3% for men, and less than 1% in
women [Personality Disorders and Impulse Control Disorders, 238].
What is very disturbing about psychopaths, besides their sense of special
entitlement, is the complete lack of empathy for normal people, for,
"antisocials (psychopaths) seem to lack a
conscience, feeling little or no empathy for the people whose lives they
touch... the antisocial effortlessly resists all regulation, unable to
see beyond his self-interest or to adopt standards of right versus
wrong."
[Black, XIII].
Not all psychopath are uneducated low-class
misfits. Some of them are quite handsome and have good careers, and use this
all the more to their benefit.
Take a look at Ted Bundy; my friend's mother
once went on a double-date with him and claimed he was the nicest person.
His mother said he was the,
"best son any mother could have."
Bundy was also apparently quite good-looking,
which made him even more dangerous.
So not all psychopaths are derelict,
low-class, high school drop-outs, there are many who also work in
professional occupations; the fact remains that there are just more
psychopaths who come from impoverished backgrounds than not.
Also, not all psychopaths are calm, cool, and collected. Some of them appear
strange or odd, and their behavior can be eccentric or unusual. I believe
this is what can confuse victims most often.
Psychopaths often appear:
intense and "electrifying".
Do not be misled if someone
appears harmless, "foolish", or seems offbeat.
An "angelic" visage can also often fool people.
Just picture
John Wayne Gacy in his "clown costume" as he entertained
children as one example. Another example which someone on the "Victims of
Psychopathy" board came up with was
Bill Clinton
and his "goofy" yet
loveable demeanor (so is Clinton really a psychopath? Many believe he is).
A psychopath (he was diagnosed anti-social) I knew used the harmless
cover-up quite well.
Everyone thought he was very funny. I did too, at
first. Then, little by little, I realized there was something "not right"
about him. At first his seemingly harmless pranks were charming, but after a
while, he became more of a nuisance and disrupted our work environment,
which created havoc and tension between employees. I've learned, a
psychopath can use these disguises for his own hidden purpose.
Regardless of race, social class, or occupation,
however, the psychopath is dangerous to society, for,
"the nature of ASP (psychopathy) implies
that it wreaks more havoc on society than most other mental illnesses
do, since the disorder primarily involves reactions against the social
environment that drag other people into its destructive web...
The
despair and anxiety wrought by antisocials (psychopaths) tragically
affects families and communities, leaving deep physical and emotional
scars..."
[Black, 5].
There is much to the psychopathic personality
which is baffling and disturbing.
1 in about 25-30 people are psychopathic (also
known as sociopaths or anti-social - the correct title being psychopath.)
Since the majority or them are men, I wrote this site in part, to warn women
about the dangers, especially women online, which I believe is a favorite
"new medium" which appeals to psychopaths.
I have personal experience with this subject as
well.
This is because,
"antisocials (psychopaths) are not just
characters in our fictional or true-life entertainments. They are family
members, friends, co-workers, neighbors, or strangers we may encounter
every day."
[Black, 10].
Pamela Jayne, M.A., writes that,
"30% of men are sociopathic."
If about every three out of ten men I may meet
are psychopathic, I would assume this is not something to take lightly.
According to these statistics, that would mean every three out of ten men
and maybe every one out of ten females. The truth is, we do not really know
exactly how many individuals are psychopathic; however, there seems to be a
rise in the prevalence of psychopathy and that is why some claim that
numbers are higher.
Dr. Black claims that psychopathy leads right
behind depression, along with schizophrenia and borderline personality
disorder, which is an astounding fact.
