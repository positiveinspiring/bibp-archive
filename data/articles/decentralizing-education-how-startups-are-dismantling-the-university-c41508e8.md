Student/teacher
interaction
What about
student/teacher interaction? What about building a social and
professional network? How can you get a job without a degree? How will
you know youre succeeding without grades?
Every seasoned supporter of self-directed
education has faced questions like this.
If you havent yet, you will. Trust me.
People often have a hard time understanding how
certain elements of education can flourish outside of classrooms.
Homeschoolers and unschoolers have found creative solutions - cooperative
classes for varying subjects, speech and debate leagues, field trip groups -
that decentralize and expand the learning experience.
But what about higher education? Can all the
benefits that society associates with traditional higher education be
provided and even exceeded with non-traditional methods?
The purpose of this post is to look at how
startups are doing just that.
UnCollege has written posts with an in-depth
look at specific startups, such as Udacity, but here were going to take a
high-level approach and see how the startup community is providing benefits
that traditional higher education institutions claim to have a monopoly on.
Well do this by focusing on their solutions for
content delivery, social interaction, professional feedback, and
certification.
Content delivery
If youve been following trends in higher education at all, the idea that
universities dont have an edge on content delivery wont be surprising to
you.
Institutionalized-ed says that students should
learn in a way that allows them to successfully regurgitate information via
testing and exams. Decentralized education says let the student learn in a
way that allows them to master the information, not just
regurgitate it..
The content is the part of the university that
has become most decentralized - it started more than 10 years ago
with MITs
OpenCourseWare and has continued from
there.
-
Code School is
all about not just learning but creation... Students have a chance
to learn and then implement their knowledge throughout the course,
so that upon completion the student not only has a workable
knowledge of the material, but also the tools to apply it in the
real world.
-
Udacity
emphasizes mastery learning to make sure that students have multiple
attempts to demonstrate their new knowledge and only move on when
they have completely mastered a subject.
While the content exists, one problem that
hasnt yet been solved is curation - when exploring the Internet, how do you
find learning content?
And more importantly, what is good and true?
Startups like LearningJar.com or Learnist are
starting to make headway in this area but its still a very young space.
Building a
community
Campus settings give students the benefit of socializing and networking with
other students and teachers. Startups take on this challenge in a variety of
ways.
-
Livemocha is an online
language learning platform. Cultivating a community of
language-learners is an important part of their model. They provide
a stimulating and safe environment for students to practice their
skills with native speakers or tutors.
-
Meetup.com is an online
network of local groups. You can start or find a group in your area
with a huge variety of interests - everything from languages to
dancing to education to politics, and lots in between. Udacity even
has meetup groups in 292 cities where students can interact and
supplement their courses.
-
The Open University offers
600+ online courses. They have student forums where students can
share and discuss any topics of interest to them.
-
Hoot.me lets you convert
facebook into study mode to connect with students and tutors around
the world.
-
Openstudy.com is a social
learning network where students can ask questions, give help, and
connect to other students studying the same subject.
Its easy to see that startups actually have the
potential to connect students to a much wider network than is available on
campus.
Students are able to communicate with other
students and teachers all around the world, and can also access face-to-face
groups using meetup.com.
However, this space is still very young.
I envision a day where you can pull out your
iPhone, open an app, and walk down to your local coffee shop for a class
discussion.
Feedback
Feedback in this case is any way for a student to track and interpret his or
her progress. Most non-institutional courses dont involve grades.
How can students evaluate their knowledge?
-
Livemocha students receive
instant feedback through their interaction with native speakers and
tutors.
-
Udacity has quizzes built
into their videos to ensure that you are understanding the material
along the way. There are also problem sets but both quizzes and
problem sets are optional and are meant to enhance your learning.
Also they offer final exams at the end of the course.
-
Code Hero has interactive
exercises built into their courses that students must successfully
complete before moving on. This allows the students to know theyve
mastered the content before moving on.
In reality, the feedback loop in non-traditional
courses tends to be much shorter and more meaningful than a traditional
grading system.
Students are able to keep a much closer track of
their progress, and the feedback is generally more effective. Correction
from a native speaker is far more beneficial than an A to F grade on a
language exam. Review from multiple sources is much more beneficial than a
grade from one instructor.
One problem in the feedback system that has not
been addressed is the role of mentoring and coaching traditionally provided
by a teacher.. Companies like Clarity.fm are
starting to work towards a solution on this but are a long ways from
ubiquity.
Certification
This is a big one.
Most people would argue that
taking online courses that dont confer college credit is not a very smart
move. After all, credits lead to degrees. All employers are looking for
degrees, right?
That discussion is for another time, but
startups are providing records and certifications in a variety of ways.
-
Smarterer allows you to
take tests in order to prove your skills in a wide span of subjects
- from facebook to CSS to English for Business. You can share your
scores, and recruiters can even evaluate candidates by comparing
Smarterer scores.
-
Udacity will give students
resumes to over 20 partner companies. Their course certifications
are recognized by major technology companies who are actively
recruiting from the Udacity student body.
-
edX, a joint venture
between MIT and Harvard, is awarding certificates to students who
show a mastery of the subject of their course.
-
Coursera offers a certificate of
completion for some of their courses.
-
Code Hero awards badges
when a course is completed.
All these certifications can be compiled into an
online or hard copy portfolio. This portfolio can function as your education
transcript for personal use or to provide to future employers.
Alternatively, it is also possible to take free
courses and then take an exam to receive college credit in those subjects.
