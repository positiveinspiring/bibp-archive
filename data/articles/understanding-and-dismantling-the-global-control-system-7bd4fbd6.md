Looking at the global situation from the perspective of fear is
counterproductive.
We need to look at it from a perspective of
concern, and see the opportunity that lies in having the knowledge of the
global situation. There are opportunities in all these problems. Many
people, when they discover the global situation and discover the truth about
the world we live in, they move straight into fear.
This does not help alleviate the situation.
It's
one thing to be aware of it, but it's another thing to be working actively
to rectify this problem:
-
the problem of government corruption
-
the problem
of corporatism
-
the problem of commerce being superimposed over the human
experience to the point where money and economics is viewed as being more
important than people and more important than life
Unfortunately this is the situation we currently
face.
Many people in our society have grown quite accepting of this; they believe
that if they don't pay their bills then they should be removed from their
houses and cast out onto the street.
These bills are all contrived, and the way they
are contrived is by superimposing a system of interest-based commerce over
the minds of the people.
Our money system itself is created by a private
bank which charges the government interest on the use of their money, which
immediately places everybody who uses money into a state of unofficially
manufactured debt. This is a simplistic way of looking at it, and it is
actually much worse than that.
The banks manufacture the paper that we use
as money. Money is in fact created when people take out loans. Because the paper that we use is privately
printed, privately owned and privately run, there is a debt attached to
using that paper.
This has the effect of placing everybody within
our society into a state of perpetual self-generating debt, which lasts
their entire life and sometimes beyond; thereby passing that debt onto their
children. All of this debt is contrived and manufactured, and is completely
unnecessary.
Because the worth or value of people in our society is very much based on
their economic or social standing (according to the parameters of this
society), we tend to readily discard people below us on the social ladder -
because we deem them to be of less worth or value than people who have
substantial financial interests in the world. This is a programmed,
fictional reality - people are quite literally trained to think this way.
This is one of the main objectives of the modern
education system.
The education system has become more and more
business-oriented as generations have gone by, and this makes it possible
for sections of society to be discarded, one rung at a time, while the
people above them on the social ladder never really believe that it could
happen to them.
However the entire system is designed to slowly move up the
social ladder until it has discarded everybody except those who issue the
currency. This will effectively create a two-tiered
society whereby we will have a ruling elite and a working class.
There are many people who are quite well-off in the world at the moment who
believe that they will be safe from this system, but ultimately they won't.
Eventually it will get that high on the social ladder, that everybody who
does not control the money supply will be under the control of those who do.
We the people, should we choose to step into our power, can prevent all of
this from happening; because it's all happening due to fictional rules that
public trustees have written on paper.
It is important for people to bear in mind the
uncomfortable truth that if we do not choose to step into our power then the
situation just described will occur, because it is the only possible outcome
of this money system. This is why this money system has been put in place,
to create the two-tiered society separated only by those who perceive they
have power between the 'elite' and the working class.
These people with perceived power will be the
police and government officials who sit in the middle.
These people will be given small tokens of power
to make them feel as though they have authority over people, which of course
will serve to give them the confidence they need to oppress the working
class.
If you take everybody's power away from them, reduce people to the point
where they are quite literally abject slaves without their knowledge and you
start giving small tokens of power to people within the group, then their
egos will always take over and they'll start throwing their weight around. If
you watch which people throw their weight around the heaviest, you find the
sociopaths within the crowd.
Those are the ones that
the
'elite' elevate to
positions of authority, because they know that they have no empathy, and
that they are quite happy to harvest energy from the population around them.
By taking people's inherent power and value from them, you effectively
disconnect them from the true energy source of the universe, and the most
ready source of energy for these people then becomes the people around them
- and that's where they harvest their energy.
This is why people who are so
disconnected make the best 'leaders' for this system.
The plan is to create a two-tiered society whereby the only separation
between the two will be the controlling hand which controls the debt-slaves,
all of whom are controlled and do the bidding of those who issue the paper.
This process is going to be achieved and is in
fact well under way. It is occurring all due to the parameters of
a United
Nations
directive known as
Agenda
21.
When looking at
Agenda 21, many people understand that it is
a
depopulation program; it is a program designed to corral
humankind into manageable portions which will be achieved by placing them
within controlled sections of population (concentrated areas), and to
'return the Earth to nature' (or at least that's how it is presented to the
world).
However, they are not quite sure how it is going
to be carried out.
The reality is that Agenda 21 is being
implemented right now, in a very subtle manner, using means which most
people would consider to be completely unrelated, and yet which are all
connected.
To see these connections, it is extremely important for people to realize
that the money system - money itself - is the glue that is used to hold this
control mechanism together. Money connects everything together and is the
catalyst for the whole thing.
When you look at the system of commerce that has
been superimposed over our societies, and how it slowly moves up the rungs
of the social ladder, where people are discarded according to their economic
worth, you begin to see how the depopulation plan is coming into effect.
When looking at concentrated pockets of
civilization and 'returning the Earth to nature', one might ask,
"How is this to be achieved?", since many people live in rural areas.
Well what happens if you destroy the
ground-water in rural areas?
People who do live in rural areas, who run
farms, simply cannot stay there anymore. It simply doesn't become viable to
ship water in all the time. Not to mention the fact that the water that is
coming out of the ground is now toxic. Enter coal seam gas mining, or
fracking (see 'The
Dangers of Fracking and Why it Must Be Prevented').
We don't actually need gas as an energy source; there are other means of
energy we could have.
The Serbian scientist
Nikola
Tesla was going to give the whole world
free energy back at
the turn of the last century, and his financers wouldn't allow him to do it
because they realized they were not able to meter his energy device, and so
therefore there was no economic gain in doing so.
Many of the problems we face as a society, and
many of the most pollutive industries on the planet, exist solely to meet
our energy needs. Indeed it is the demand for energy which perpetuates these
industries, and it is these industries which keep many people working.
The demand for energy is one of the things that
makes the modern world go round, and if people were to obtain access to free
energy then it would most certainly free them from debt-slavery.
We don't need to be harvesting coal seam gas in order to meet our energy
needs - there are far better ways of doing things. So, what is the real
purpose of coal seam gas?
The only guaranteed outcome from having a gas
well somewhere is that it is going to pollute the ground water below the gas
well.
-
This can be seen happening everywhere
where gas wells have been. Methane is coming up in streams,
tap-water has been catching fire and wells are being polluted.
-
This obviously is the real purpose of
coal seam gas mining.
-
This is effectively driving people out
of the rural areas, away from their traditional farm lands, and
forcing them into concentrated pockets of civilization.
-
This will be ongoing; if you watch this
over the next few years you're going to see more and more people
moving from their farms, being forced to as it is too toxic to live
there anymore.
-
This is how these sections of population
are being cleared and forced to move into the cities. It isn't about
returning the rural areas to nature; it is about making those areas
available for sustainable resource practices. Sustainable resource practices are about
sustaining the industry for as long as possible - doing whatever you can to
make sure you can keep exploiting the area. That is what sustainable development is all
about. It is just wrapped up in a package and painted green so that people
will think it is ecologically friendly, when it is exactly the opposite.
There are new laws being introduced in the UK which will effectively outlaw
homelessness.
People are made homeless due to the economic
model; homelessness and the discarding of the population is a natural
by-product of this corrupt economic system. Couple this with coal seam gas
mining and the pollution of the water, and the introduction of GM crops
which effectively cause sterility in those who consume them over successive
generations.
Tests carried out on animals clearly result in
sterility by the third generation in all animals that have been tested
consuming GM food. All this is Agenda 21 in motion - depopulation.
It is easy to force people into consuming
GM foods simply by placing them in
positions of poverty, and providing unlabelled GM food at low prices in
supermarkets.
The low-priced 'value' brands are likely GM, and
all are designed to de-populate what is perceived to be the lower-classes of
society - those who are not economically viable. This system does everything
it can to ensure that people remain in a state which is not economically
viable.
Another way this is done is through a process of
total
criminalization.
The concept of total criminalization is
something which is very attractive to governments because if you make
everybody a criminal, suddenly everyone becomes uniform in the eyes of the
law.
The way they do this is by gradually introducing more and more laws, so that
eventually almost everything becomes a crime. This includes all the things
you would normally do as a normal, functioning human being.
They then attach fines to these breaches of
so-called law, again placing economic stress on people. This again leads to
homelessness, which eventually leads to prison terms, and of course those in
prison are being fed GM foods. So here we see how the introduction of
legislation is again contributing towards the United Nations depopulation program.
There is something very important to understand about legislation, when
looking at why there is so much crime in the world today.
The reason there is so much crime is because the
government is introducing more and more legislation thereby making almost
everything a crime. The more legislation that is enacted, the more crime is
created.
That is the main purpose of legislation - it
isn't to keep people safe, it is to create crime and thereby create the
mechanism by which the wealth of the people may be extracted from them via
fines and jail terms.
All of these things are ongoing; they are happening right now. While all of
these little, subtle things are happening in society, designed to place
people in a state of manufactured financial stress, people aren't noticing
it because they are distracted waiting for a big cataclysm such as a
financial crash or the outbreak of World War III.
And so people are not paying attention to what
is happening all around them right now, and they're not seeing how it all
connects together.
The 'divide and conquer' strategy has worked very effectively on our
society, and that is the main reason these problems still exist and, no
matter what we do, things just keep going along in the same direction.
This is because we are attempting to use the
parameters of the system to deal with the system, when really we have the
potential and the power to step above the system and rain the whole thing in
- and hold our public trustees accountable for their actions. We have the
power to do this, but it will only be achieved by a united community. That
type of unity will only ever be achieved by people who are willing to
respect one another.
The solution is as simple as people changing their perspective and their
attitude, not only towards the people around them, but also towards
themselves. The lack of respect for other people always has its basis in
one's lack of respect for themselves.
This is a programmed reality which people are
forced to endure simply by operating in the parameters of the system. This
is a very clever system and it is designed to completely mess-up the human
psyche, and you've got to give it 10 points for effectiveness.
However, that being said, the tide is about to turn - things are about to
change. It will however require the participation of the people in order for
it to happen.
I genuinely believe that's what this time in
history is about, and things are indeed about to change. More and more
people are beginning to question
this 'reality' and question this system.
Something people can do, when looking at this
whole system - social, economic or government, is to ask themselves if their
life is one of comfort and abundance; and if it isn't, to ask themselves
why.
-
Why are you forced to run so hard on the
treadmill?
-
Why are you forced to be enslaved to an
economic model which is interest-based and designed to place you in
scarcity?
-
Why is our system like this?
-
Why are there laws making it illegal to
feed homeless people?
-
Why is it that when a supermarket throws
food out at the end of the day, they put it in a locked bin and
won't simply give it to poor people?
-
Why are they attempting to bring in laws
which may outlaw homelessness?
-
Why do we have a system which was
created by mankind to serve mankind's needs, and yet mankind has
become the most expendable thing within its parameters?
When you ask yourself these questions it becomes
clear that what has happened to our societies is that we have had a slavery
system gradually superimposed over our reality.
Thus in the modern world today, virtually
everybody is forced to live in a state of perpetual or self-generating debt
as soon as they are old enough to work.
What we have here is 'people farming'; we have
human trafficking by debt-slavery, whereby every person within this society
has been turned into a commodity. Turned into a mechanism by which the
criminal, ruling banksters at the top of the food-chain are able to harvest
your wealth.
Real wealth is not measured in terms of possessions; it cannot be judged in
terms of financial security. Real wealth is your life; your health. What
makes you wealthy is if you are a happy, healthy person living in a good
environment.
The banksters harvest your time, your health and your life - they
harvest you.
It is extremely important for people to see the reality of this, and it is
very much necessary for people to understand that this is a system that is
wholly supported and perpetuated by governments.
The reason that governments are able to get away
with it is because the people have forgotten what their place in the social
hierarchy is. People have forgotten that governments are public servants -
public trustees; we actually sit above them in the food-chain. They are in
fact our employees.
Through the imposition of the
government-controlled education system, this knowledge has been gradually
educated out of the masses.
Meanwhile the bills and laws have been raised
and raised, and people have been taught to run faster and faster on the
treadmill, so that now they're running flat-out and they don't even realize
that their running. This means of course that they never really have time to
look around them and notice what is going on, and how this system is run.
When you start to see how the system is run, it becomes obvious that we're
being scammed by the very people we employ to manage our infrastructure for
us and to keep us safe.
These are the very people who we appoint to
positions of trust to manage our society in an honest, caring and decent
manner. Our public servants are not doing that; they are all in breach of
trust, and they are using the power we give them to steal the wealth of all
of our nations. It is about time we paid attention to this fact.
If we were to pay attention to it, from the
perspective of a respectful and therefore empowered community, we could
change this situation in a day. There is a real need for us to do this.
When looking at the world today, one must ask the questions:
-
How far are we prepared to go?
-
How much are we prepared to take?
-
Are we prepared to allow our planet to
be destroyed and the lives of the people around us to be ruined
simply because some people wrote some words down on a piece of
paper, and dared to call it law?
-
Is that what it takes to control us?
-
Is that all it takes to decimate the
human species - simply writing something down on a piece of paper?
-
Is that all it takes to remove the will
of the people, and to force them to comply with their own
destruction?
-
Are we so confused as to what reality is
that we really believe this fictional paper-based world is real?
People are waking up in vast numbers all around
the world, and are beginning to question the fiction.
The more a government attempts to lock society
down, the more people wake up to the control mechanism. So ultimately the
government, and the control system itself, is bringing about its own demise.
The system is ramping up the control grid so
much now and in such a hurried manner. The people who are doing it are
stumbling; they're making mistakes and making their presence known.
More and more people are becoming empowered with
the knowledge of who and what they are - and that is truly a beautiful
thing. The key word in this control system is 'fiction'. We can step above
the entire thing once we remember who and what we are and choose to stand in
our power.
Nobody controls the vessel that you inhabit.
The only mind that controls your flesh is
yourself. Anybody who claims otherwise is running a slavery system. Once you
become aware of it you start to see the way out of the slavery system. It
has to be done with respect and in a peaceful manner. Once you understand
how the system works, and when you truly understand and respect yourself,
then you really don't see any need to conduct yourself otherwise anyway.
Because if you do, really all you're doing is
playing right into their hands. There is a far better way of doing things.
The way to conduct yourself in any of these situations is from a perspective
of empowerment and respect. It all comes down to the individual, and always
has.
There are a lot of movements, currently being waged in the world, against
many of the problems that we face. But all too often these organizations are
still attempting to use the legal system to find a way of making a stand
against the actions of our corrupt governments.
By doing this what they are failing to see is
that the modern legal system was not constructed to afford people remedy,
but rather to tie people up in red tape and to protect the system.
The legal system was designed by the system in
order to protect itself. So we are never going to find a remedy for our
current situation by using the parameters that are given to us by the
system.
What we need to do is remember or place in the social hierarchy,
step above it, and hold our public trustees in breach of trust.
This could be done through something like a
People's Mandate. If you could get enough people together in your country to
mandate your will to the government and instruct them to carry out that
will, then if they wish to maintain the facade of being a democratic and
fair system they will have no choice but to comply with the will of the
people.
Failure to abide by a People's Mandate, properly
delivered to our elected trustees, would mean that the government has
abdicated its right to govern - and would be required to step down. Again,
this could only happen if people choose to respect each other.
Ultimately, when you look at this situation, the solution to all of the
problems we face always comes down to the people themselves.
The power to change the world is in the hands of
each individual. The key to your own salvation is in your heart, and the key
to changing this world is in applying your heart, energy and respect to the
people around you and to the world at large.
If we do this, we can change things.
The
question is:
What is it going to take for that to happen?
Participation is
all it would take. There is nobody on the Earth who really has any more
power than anybody else.
The only power that people perceive they have is
the power they are granted from others who choose to give their own power
away.
Once one becomes aware of the situation, and
aware of the fact that these choices do exist, things can be viewed very
differently. From the very moment that you wake up to the machinations of
this control system, you are given the conscious choice whether to
participate in this system or not. Refuse to comply with any piece of
legislation which interferes with your moral compass.
Ultimately there is only one law on this planet:
Do No Harm...
Any legislation that contravenes that law is no
law, and is entitled to no obedience.

What's The Problem?
Surviving the Matrix - EP 1
Part 2
February 16, 2014
The way to fix all of the problems we face in
the world is to remove fear from our consciousness.
Something that is very
beneficial and helpful in removing that fear is to understand what reality
is, and how reality works. By incorporating a right-brain understanding into
your perception of reality, you can literally change reality - you can
change your personal reality anyway.
I have attracted so many different
things into my life - people, places, experiences, etc. simply by following
the synchronicity in my life that becomes more apparent the more I open up
my right brain.
You find that reality wants to interact with you, but you only want to
interact with reality. It's like we feel that our input is all that matters;
we don't consider the input of reality itself.
You find that you're actually
part of this ongoing dialogue between you and reality.
It's like a
conversation that's going on between yourself and the Universe, but you're
not listening. It's like you're having a conversation with someone but
you're wearing ear-plugs, you can't hear what is being said to you, and
you're the one who's doing all the talking.
We talk to each other, we might
talk to our animals, but we don't talk to the energy field around us. Well
we do talk to it but we don't listen to what it says back to us - probably
because we don't realize we're talking to it energetically, when in fact we
are.
There is an electromagnetic interaction going on between you and the
surrounding energy field all the time, but you simply don't realize that
this is actually a language that you are speaking because you've forgotten
what the language is, and you don't have the higher senses active that are
required to perceive and comprehend this language.
One of the biggest
obstacles to you ever accessing these higher senses, and ever understanding
this language, is fear. It is the vibration that fear sets up within your
body/system/energy field.
This is why our entire society, and everything
about it, is all based on fear. It is fear-based mind control. They control
your mind so that you don't perceive anything outside of a left-brain
reality; the five-sense perception that you have of reality.
When you have this understanding, and you finally comprehend what reality is
and how it works, then fear just falls away from you. You begin to see that
there really is nothing to fear, and that the only real problem is the
vibration of fear itself - that is the problem.
I see people in fear about
the world that is being created, but really it's just the propagation of
fear.
The terrible world that they are so in fear of is only being created
because of their failure to face that fear. That fear is the same fear that
is in themselves, and that serves to keep them separate from the people
around them. You have to break down the fear, and let go of the fear.
To move forward from this point you have to let go of everything that you
perceived to be reality, let go of everything that you perceived to be
important to you. Of course your family and friends are important to you,
but objects and 'stuff' that we collect really don't mean anything, they
don't make us who we are. What makes us who we are is what energy lies
within our hearts.
You have to let go of what you believed, what you cared about, what you
perceived about yourself and how you perceived others. Let go of everything
that has happened in your life up to this point, simply focus on the Now,
and the future that we could create if we were to do this. Just let go of
all of that stuff that you've being carrying around for years.
Realize that
all of it is a product of this system. All of it is a product of the
perception we have been taught to have of what reality is.
Let go of judgment, revenge, and all the animosity you feel towards everybody. All of
these things are simply mirrors; they are opportunities to address certain
emotions that may be raised within yourself.
All of these negative emotions
are things that you need to experience because all of them are opportunities
for healing and change.
If something is making you feel bad, you need to change that. The only way
you can change that bad feeling is by embracing it and feeling it;
understanding why you feel that feeling - making that feeling one with
yourself, and thereby neutralizing it so you can move on to address the next
mirror and the next negative emotion that you have.
All of these emotions
are fear-based, and mostly it's a fear of looking within and facing that
which we see within ourselves.
Any bad feelings you have about anybody else - that's not them, that's you,
because you are the one creating that feeling. You can feel your body
change, your heartbeat raise. Your body chemistry literally changes and you
start feeling strange when you're having these negative feelings around
people.
This shows that a physical effect is actually caused within your
body and it's not a healthy effect. It's what makes you sick, and creates
illness in your body. That's what these negative feelings and emotions do,
and they only affect you - they don't affect other people - and they're all
fear-based.
You have got to let go of all of this.
Once we can let go of all of these feelings and animosity, and realize that
everybody who ever wronged us only did so because of what they had perceived
reality to be up to that point, then it's easy to forgive them. It is easy
to forgive anything that anybody has done because now we have an opportunity
to welcome them home, to bring the whole human race back to where it should
be.
This is happening right now, and it is how consciousness will evolve;
but people have to choose to do it, to participate, and when they do true
enlightenment will happen. That's how we can change the direction of mankind
and all life on this planet.
We are currently heading for complete
destruction in order to support an economic system which isn't real. It's
just numbers on a screen, pieces of paper, words and figures that people
make up.
It has nothing to do with reality, the world or the human race and
it doesn't benefit anybody (see
Illusory Money and the Economic
System Construct).
It is remarkable when you really look at humankind, and you see this
economic leviathan that we've created in order to exploit the resources of
the planet and each other. Many people are in such an incredible state of
fear should anything ever happen to this system, because if the system were
to break down they would feel as though their life had simply decayed before
their eyes.
And yet the life that they are living, at the hands of this
system, and the way people take this system for granted, is what has caused
all of the problems that we currently see upon this planet.
On the other side of the spectrum you have people who can see the system for
what it is, but they live in a state of fear of what the system is becoming
and they speak out about it from a state of fear. Yet on both sides of the
fence we find that people still argue with each other; they still have
'stuff' with their neighbors.
They won't ever face the fear, within
themselves, that perpetuates that which they fear externally. It's really a
remarkable state that human consciousness finds itself in.
I have a feeling that a lot is about to change, and that there are some very
big things stirring with the change in energy that's happening and the shift
in consciousness that is occurring. It is still difficult to see people in
big cities showing any signs of positive change, but this sort of thing will
come later as the world changes around them.
I really do feel a huge
expansion in human awareness and human consciousness taking place, and I
believe that the plan of the 'elite' may actually be backfiring as awareness
is growing.
People are beginning to see that all of the separate problems they've all
been addressing are all simply symptoms of the one larger problem, and they
are searching for ways to address this one larger problem. I believe the
answer lies in knowing who and what you are, and being able to stand in
that.
People need to stay focused on the actual problem, which is the fact
that our servants - the public servants that we call government, the public
trustees that we employ to ensure we have a viable future - have left their
path and are all acting in breach of trust. That's the problem and once we
establish this we can change the system, and it needs to be done very
quickly.
We need to immediately cancel all debt absolutely. You don't owe anything to
anybody.
If you owe money to the bank, you don't owe it any more. You don't
owe your mortgage, you don't owe your bill to the credit card company. You
don't owe anybody any money, and you've got what you have now.
Four years
ago I cancelled all 'debt' in my own life, in a single day, by immediately
declaring No Contract with any entity that claimed I owed them money.
All
their mail was returned unopened, and within a few months all attempted
communication ceased. As a sovereign you have the power to cancel all debt
whenever you like, because all of it is a contrived fiction - a nonsense.
Cancel all the debt and that suddenly gets everybody out of this situation
of fear-based mind control, and we can work out what sort of a future we
would like to create. Work together to create a future that is viable,
sustainable, beneficial to mankind, and something that helps support all
life upon the earth.
I genuinely believe that consciousness is shifting, and that there is a very
big awakening happening all over this planet. However I would suggest that,
in order for it to happen effectively, people have to participate.
People
have to gain a better understanding of what reality is. They need to immerse
themselves in their consciousness, and immerse that consciousness into
creation. There is no force that is going to 'flick a switch' whereby
humankind suddenly becomes enlightened. There is no event that is going to
suddenly cause your higher senses to activate, unless you choose to
participate in your own evolutionary process.
In regards to evolution, I'm not referring to Darwinian evolution.
Darwinian
evolution doesn't work - it's ridiculous, it makes no sense at all. Species
do not turn into other species.
What evolves
is Consciousness - the energy
that all is made from.
All it takes is for the frequency of this energy to
rise, because higher frequency creates a greater complexity of form, of
Consciousness; a greater awareness in Consciousness.
We came from the highest source there is. We came ultimately from the mind
of the Creator itself, whatever you perceive the Creator to be. All of the
levels that people wish to go through are simply different steps on the
ladder that leads to home. Everything is a path home; everything we are
experiencing is a journey to that ultimate place from which we came.
The
awakening that is happening is truly more of a remembering, but in order for
it to happen you need to participate in reality. You need to apply yourself
to what is going on around you, and you need to let go of the baggage that's
preventing you from doing so.
Stop holding grudges against people, stop
carrying all that stuff around with you, and stop profiting from people. Stop putting a monetary value on everything. Stop buying information from
people and stop selling people information.
Simply move into your heart and
do the right thing in all that you do, stay in that energy and apply it to
the world and the people around you.
Most importantly, apply it to yourself.
We judge people badly often because we are trained and taught to judge
people badly. It's difficult to justify these feelings because the people
who have done the wrong thing by you, or in general, have very often done so
because they were never given an even playing field to begin with.
People
are thrown into the parameters of the psychopathic system and they're told
to make it work, but very often we just can't make it work.
The result is
dysfunctional people and dysfunctional society. You really can't blame
people for what they've done, because this system is designed to reward
sociopathic activity, and it is designed to squash anybody who operates in
empathy and compassion.
If people can understand the energetic nature of reality and truly grasp the
concept that they are interacting with the field around them,
electromagnetically, in everything they do and every emotion that they feel,
they will start interacting with each other differently and interacting with
the field differently.
If we put down all the 'stuff' we believe we have
with each other, stand together and turn to face this system, then we will
make a difference. But if we can't do that, then we will simply continue
down the path towards our own self-destruction - which is where we are being
led by our politicians.
There is more to reality than what you may perceive there to be. There is a
higher harmonic to all of this, and if we can start changing the way we
interact and changing the emotional basis of the interaction that we have
with people, then I believe we can create a very different world.
But it is
up to each of us to understand how this works and to apply it to our own
lives.
Ultimately it all really comes down to respect. We have been taught not to
respect each other, and this has worked to a large extent because we don't
generally respect ourselves enough. We may in some ways, but we don't in the
truest and real ways.
This is mainly because we judge ourselves by fictional
parameters. We are given certain parameters by society; we're told that we
need to live up to these economic and social parameters in order to be
successful, and if we don't do so we tend to judge ourselves poorly, and we
tend to not respect ourselves.
We are always looking for ourselves in that
which is external to ourselves - and that's not where we're going to find
the truth. The truth is only ever going to be found in your own heart; that
is where you have to look. When you do, and you apply that to the world
around you, that's when we can really make a difference.
What we have here is the greatest opportunity we've ever had for real human
freedom.
It's just up to each of us to recognize this opportunity and to
embrace it.
