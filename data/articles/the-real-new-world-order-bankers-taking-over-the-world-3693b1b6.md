How quickly best laid plans become passé. New world orders come, it seems,
as frequently as eclipses.
The old world order (ancien régime), along with 16 million people, died
during the Great European War which began on June 28, 1914 when the Austrian
heir to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, was assassinated by a Serb
nationalist, Gavrilo Princip, in Sarajevo. (Today he would be called a
terrorist.)
This assassination sent nations that had no
desire to go to war into the most destructive war the world had yet
experienced.
Europe at the beginning of 1914 consisted of six major empires and an
assortment of minor states that the major empires didnt care much about.
The six major empires,
-
Austro-Hungarian
-
French
-
German
-
British
-
Ottoman
-
Russian,
...were ensnared in military alliances (much
like the US is today) which were formed to keep the peace.
The diplomats, like those today, believed that
forming alliances that balanced the powers of different groups would keep
them from attacking each other.
-
The Central Powers consisted of
Austro-Hungary, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire
-
The Triple Entente consisted of the
other three
Peace, the diplomats thought was assured.
What happened?
When the archduke was assassinated, the Austrians, confident in their
military prowess (as Americans are today), decided to punish Serbia which
was attacked on July 28. But the Serbs ambushed the Austrians at the battles
of Cer and Kolubara. The Austrians were thrown back with heavy losses.
Russia came to the aid of its ethnically related Serbs, and Germany invaded
France through Belgium and Luxembourg.
Britain came to the defense of France and the
Ottoman Empire joined the war in the Balkans on the side of the Central
Powers. The alliances that were to ensure the peace changed a single
assassination into a massive war.
When it was over, the Austro-Hungarian, the
German, the Ottoman, and the Russian Empires had vanished and the
United States, which joined the war late on the side of the Triple Entente
had become a world player.
The old world order was gone!
Woodrow Wilson, the American President, sought to create a new old
world order by proposing his Fourteen Points. Wilson wanted to create
separate nations out of former colonies and ensure the peace by creating a
League of Nations (another peace by treaty scheme). Territorial reductions
were made to Germany and Austria, a slew of new and revived nations were
created in Eastern Europe, while France and Britain carved up the Ottoman
Empire to suit themselves.
The new old world order was just a
reconfigured old world order. It didnt last and it didnt ensure the peace.
So much for the best laid plans of diplomats.
Germany was reborn in 1933 when Adolph Hitler became Chancellor. He,
too, sought to create a new world order, one dominated by a Thousand Year
Reich (Empire). To that end, his policies were aimed at seizing Lebensraum
(living space) for the German people by extending Germanys borders.
Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia were annexed
and Poland was invaded. But alas, Poland had a mutual defense treaty
(another alliance formed to ensure the peach) with Great Britain and France,
so the invasion of Poland started World War II.
When it was over, Germany again was destroyed and Great Britain and France,
for the most part, had had their empires diminished. The United States and
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Russia) found themselves at the top
of another new old world order.
The victorious powers,
-
the US
-
the USSR
-
China
-
Great Britain
-
France,
...tried again to ensure the peace by creating
the United Nations which they attempted to keep firmly in their control by
making themselves rulers of the Security Council which had a veto on all UN
Activities all five nations didnt give unanimous approval to.
That was to be the new old world order.
But it began to come unglued immediately. China
was not represented by mainland China which had become Communist but by
Nationalist China whose government had fled to Taiwan. Communist China
soon took the Chinese seat and the two Communist nations formed a bloc while
the remaining three Capitalist nations formed another.
The
United Nations became the Disunited Nations and has
remained so to this day. This new old world order was stillborn.
Sometime after 1950 (because of secrecy, the exact date is unknown)
the Bilderbergers, realizing that the old
world ancient régime and all of these new old world orders were founded on
nation states that kept going to war with each other, began an attempt to
create a truly new world order.
David Rockefeller writes,
We are grateful to the Washington Post, the
New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose
directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of
discretion for almost forty years...
It would have been impossible for us to
develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of
publicity during those years. But, the world is more sophisticated and
prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational
sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely
preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past
centuries.
For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the
political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my
encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the
inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and
economic institutions.
Some even believe we are part of a secret
cabal working against the best interests of the United States,
characterizing my family and me as internationalists
and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more
integrated global political and economic structure - one world, if you
will.
If thats the charge, I stand guilty, and I
am proud of it
If there were no nation states, no wars could
erupt between them!
Some believe that
these international bankers have succeeded
in taking over the world, but it has never succeeded in abolishing nation
states.
In fact, there is some evidence that nation
states may be disintegrating into smaller ones.
-
Scotland is going to hold a referendum
on withdrawing from England
-
Catalonia is talking about withdrawing
from Spain
-
Czechoslovakia has broken up into the
Czech and Slovak republics
-
there is talk again of secession in the
U.S.,
...and no one quite knows what is really
happening in the Arab world.
A new world order ruled by one government? Not
hardly!
But things began to break down in the 1950s. Until then, wars were fought
between armies supported by nation states, and their endings were
foreseeable. A war ended when one army, either voluntarily or on command,
surrendered. That era appears to have ended. Old world order warfare appears
to have become passé.
When the second world war ended, the Korean Peninsula was partitioned into
Northern and Southern sections occupied by the Russians and Americans
respectively. Elections for unification were to be held in 1948 but were
not; the Americans were unsure the result would favor the South. Open
warfare broke out when North Korean forces invaded South Korea in June,
1950.
Because the Soviet Union was boycotting the
United Nations Security Council at the time, the United States and other
countries passed a Security Council resolution authorizing military
intervention. The wars progress favored each side from time to time and
continued until July, 1953 when an armistice was signed. Officially, the war
still goes on today.
The US provided 88% of the 341,000 international
soldiers which aided South Korea. The Russians and the Peoples Republic of
China aided North Korea. The Wests army was international, and the era
of never ending wars may have begun.
After a short pause, the American hubris led the US to play one-upmanship
with France. Since the end of World War II, the French had been trying to
maintain its hold on its Southeastern Asian colony of Vietnam.
But at the
Battle of Dien Bien Phu, the French were
soundly defeated and decided to give up the fight. American hubris about its
military prowess made American diplomats believe that the US could do what
the French could not and began to use American military resources to keep
South Vietnam from being united with the North.
The Pentagons military minds viewed this conflict as a traditional
two-nation-state one and believed that Americas military only had to defeat
a primitive North Vietnamese army to succeed.
They were wrong, and after twenty years of
fighting, 58,000 Americans, millions of Vietnamese had died, and the
Americans fled. But this war marked another first: the army that won all the
battles lost the war. That had never before happened in history.
Today, winning battles does not win wars. Truly
a new era in warfare has begun. What the Pentagons commanders failed to
realize was that the war was not a two state war. It was a war between an
invading army and an indigenous people who could only be defeated by total
annihilation. No possible way existed for Americans (or any other
nation-state) to win this war.
But Americans are hard learners and they learned nothing from Korea and
Vietnam, so after two misadventures that appeared to be successful (Grenada
and the 1st Gulf War), the US led another multinational force into Iraq and
Afghanistan.
After
eight years in Iraq and the installation of a new government, the
US withdrew without achieving its goals, leaving Iraq in disarray. And after
more than a decade in Afghanistan a similar outcome seems to be imminent.
Like Vietnam, these wars too are not two-state wars.
They amount to invading armies battling indigenous peoples who themselves
are not united and not under the control of any government, group, or
commander. No surrendering army in either country will ever be found. But
now theres a new twist.
The forces facing the invaders do not merely
consist of local peoples. Those peoples are assisted by non-state but
similarly minded multi-state actors.
The people opposing the West in Afghanistan are
the same groups opposing the West in,
-
Libya
-
Algeria
-
Syria
-
Yemen
-
Mali
-
Somalia
-
the Sudan,
...and elsewhere.
People who have been subjugated and exploited by
the West have begun an undeclared war on the West and westerners everywhere,
and winning this war will require not their defeat but their annihilation.
The West cannot do that without annihilating itself in the process.
The real new world order has emerged - the worlds downtrodden
against the West and its puppet, surrogate colonial governments.
These non-state but similarly minded actors will
determine the course of future world history. There is now a new world order
that the West cannot control, that military force cannot subdue, and that
concessions cannot placate.
Ancien régimes relied on military power
to influence events. The true new world order renders military power
effete. All it can now accomplish is kill for killings sake. Pure barbarity
is what the promise of Western Civilization has been reduced to.
What a wonderful world we have made!
