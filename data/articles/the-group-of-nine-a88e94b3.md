A Benevolent Guiding
Presence
I was awakened by a Benevolent Guiding Presence speaking through the
weave of the fabric of life.
At times its connection is subtle, etheric and
seemingly almost non existent. Yet at other times, it's like being
surrounded by a choir of angels singing through the streaming
synchronicities of circumstance.
I have come to know it as a highly evolved
presence whose purpose is to steer the universe to balanced harmony in all
places, what some would call 'nirvana'. It unblocks blockages so that
authentic flow may resume. It is currently drawing close to help humanity in
these times of powerful, but often confusing transition.
I have come to know this presence as "The
Group of Nine" (The
Council of Nine?)...
Self Realization
In the beginning the exchanges with this group although revelatory, were
also very frustrating.
It's like they'd spike something in my
consciousness for me to look at - a question about some aspect of reality -
but then leave it 'hanging in the air' and me with it! I knew I was being
helped, but why wouldn't they answer my obvious questions?
Then one day it dawned on me.
Yet sometimes we need pointers as to what food
to eat, how to eat it, and especially in times of great confusion, where
your mouth is!
So I came to realize this is the most powerful way true benevolence works.
It 'spikes' your attention to an issue in your life which is holding you
back in some way - because there is some degree of 'grey area' inside which
is manifesting outside.
But rather than steal the 'glory' from you,
rather than owning your process, it asks pertinent questions by presenting
synchronicities - events you simply cannot ignore. In such instances, we're
being invited to go into the confusion and unravel for ourselves our
feelings about that situation.
For only then, can we truly SELF realize. And
then, when the realizations have been made, it never takes the 'prize' for
itself. It doesn't need our worship, it stands on no pedestal above us.
Above all, it never says "you owe me for it".
Indeed it never even asks for thanks...
"A leader is best when people barely know he
exists,
when his work is done, his aim fulfilled,
they will say: we did it ourselves."
Lao Tzu
The Team
It is through this very process that I have gotten to know "the Nine" or
"the Team" as I affectionately now know them.
My consciousness would be spiked to guiding
realizations. Like the nature of channeling for example. How disempowering
such activity really can be - the risk of giving up our own sense of 'soul
sovereignty' in favor of something more evolved or aware than us.
What the Team have shown me from the start, is
that even though they are extremely highly evolved, they too share just an
aspect on truth. They - like all others - are not the fountain of absolute
wisdom.
They can point to inner Gateways yes, but
we have to find the way through them ourselves.
As they're often showing me:
"there's knowing the path and walking the
path,
the two although related,
are entirely different"...
"Do not believe anything
because it is said by an authority,
or if it is said to come from angels,
or from Gods, or from an inspired source."
"Believe it only if you have explored it
in your own heart and mind and body
and found it to be true."
Gautama Buddha
I feel blessed to be in near constant dialogue
with them.
But this vocabulary is by no means an exchange
of clumsy words. I remember my very first sweat lodge. At some point, the
extreme heat seemed to catapult me directly into a higher plain of
consciousness - what I now know as the 11th Dimension. I
was both simultaneously in the lodge and the higher place at the same time.
The 11th Dimension, which I'd
unfolded into, was a totally formless place of white light.
Yet I could sense the presence of the Team all
around me. It was like there was simply no need of any kind of form - they'd
advanced way beyond such crass simplicity. And 'conversation' was a
'telepathic knowing activation'. Not the transfer of thought or ideas
though, more the sparking of a movement within oneself that you then realize
for yourself.
It's like striking a tuning fork and placing it next to another one. Soon
the other fork will also begin to resonate but most importantly, with its
OWN natural frequency.
So a question may be posed "what do you think
about that?" followed by a vibration that causes you to feel what you think
about that.
And the realizations, when they come, I
experience as a deep sense of rightness - sometimes blissful joy - but not
an external projection into me. Rather it unfolds within me, is then
integrated and becomes a usual state of being.
We've been greatly inspired by this heavenly
example in how to work effectively with others: to strike a note in order to
catalyze a movement of energy, but not our energy, rather to unleash the
inherent energy of the people we're working with.
The Seven Kohans
The Team have a particular responsibility for the Seven Rays of Divine
Impulse.
It is through these that they 'spike' ones
consciousness to issues to be realized. Imagine the source of the universe
as a infinite well and energy flowing from it like a constant stream of
light. The light is blended as the seven rays we see in a rainbow, each a
carrier of consciousness, of knowing, of realization in some particular
aspect.
And our soul is a blend of these seven aspects
of consciousness. Unique for each of us, our particular blend sounds a note
- a soul ray harmonic - which makes different sounds depending on the 'wind
chimes' it is currently flowing through.
Sometimes those wind chimes get blocked up (like the human body so easily
can be), in which case the soul cannot sing its heavenly tune authentically
or accurately. It is then that the seven "Kohans" of the Team come into
their own.
By stimulating a particular frequency, their
resonance can be felt inside, the note then strengthens and re-attunes
within us. We re-acquire those precious gifts so painfully lost.
Take for example the Ray 4 - that of non judgmental discernment -
being able to figure out Right Action aligned with the natural universal
flow of the moment.
It is what some call the "Christ Consciousness"
(although it is not religious in nature) which is right now spiking in the
hearts of people all around the world, reminding them to connect inside
themselves and find their own truth within events and circumstances.
We might not judge another, but it might also be
appropriately discerning not to involve them in our lives. They might carry
a vibration that limits our own, not liberates it.
So there is a "Kohan" - a highly evolved aspect of consciousness - which
holds responsibility for each of the seven rays.
The Kohans form seven of the nine. The number
eight blends the frequencies of the seven that the Team may speak with one
coherent voice and the number nine is a mirror - like a sounding board - to
ensure the voice sounds correctly.
So the Nine act both separately and together as
one.
A case of false
representation
It has been made known within me that the Team have been misunderstood and
thus misrepresented throughout the eons.
Humanity and other groups HAVE placed 'Gods' on
pedestals and worshiped them, abandoning their own inner sense of rhyme,
reason and reality. As a result, humanity has created the group karma of
disempowerment. And by the universal Law of Attraction, that karma has drawn
to it a disabling force we call "Opposing
Consciousness".
They are manifested as multi-dimensional
entities acting in the field all around us and controlling humanity for its
own ends.
Adolph Hitler was once quoted as saying...
'the grandest deception of all is that which
is closest to the truth'.
And that's just how Opposing Consciousness
works.
At a lower level, it has created Gods and
Masters which humanity has come to worship. Right from the earliest
civilizations such as
the Sumerians and
Egyptians,
worshipping the Gods has
created the 'great' religions and the atrocities
that such blind 'faith' has then led mankind to.
Today, at a slightly higher level of deception, the Gods posed before us are
those of materiality.
Opposing Consciousness controls humanity
through the implantation of a thought matrix - this is how we live, what you
need, want or what you should aspire to - all relatively close to true
soulful characteristics. Like 'abundance' for example.
It was always meant to be about the abundant
inner joy of self realization through experience - not by trying to manifest
some external physical gratification. Not that we shouldn't enjoy life, just
that if we attach to the material, we loose the authentic sense of the
etherial.
But that is far from the limit of its deceiving capacity.
Even now, amongst 'spiritual' groups, there's
still internal abandonment going on in favor of some 'great sage' some
'Archangel' or 'Ascended Master'. Acting through the field, Opposing
Consciousness will even infuse people with apparently loving
consciousness, a 'hook' to draw people into a needy feeling of constant
bliss.
Let us be real, real life is simply not always
blissful!
The Team I know are of profound humility. Even with their vast knowing, they
will not override or over influence someone else.
They don't establish themselves as some great
council or absolute authority on truth. Yes they have profound insight, yet
there's never a placing above or beyond. The truth speaks for itself, but
sometimes it needs a little help.
That is what the Group of Nine are here
for.
They'll rise out of the background and whisper
softly in your ear, but if there's insensitivity, fixedness or closedness to
a deeper exploration of your truth, they'll simply back off, fading quietly
once more into the universal background.
Communing with the
Team
Humanity is yearning right now for help and the Team have responded.
If we can learn how to listen to the subtle
inner interplay and watch the interrelated external synchronicities, then we
can all speak with the Team and derive enormous benefit from the exchange.
So how do we do that exactly?
Here is my personal experience...
-
Firstly, we must let go of the need to
be anything in particular except what we really are and what we
really feel to be in the moment. We must learn how to find peace
with total vulnerability to the moment. We must be willing to accept
that we don't know what's coming next, no matter how evolved or
insightful we think we might be. We must work to become 'as nothing
in it all' just as the nine have done.
-
Secondly, we must allow freedom of
expression to reign in our lives, learning to recognize and honor
our truth. Yet at the same time, holding open the possibility for
our truth to evolve which involves not filling the space with our
truth at the expense of all and everyone else. Instead we speak our
truth, but then watch in the external mirror for some confrontation
which invites ever deeper revelation and perfection.
-
Thirdly, we must find profound self
honesty. We must be watching our motivations for action with the
scrutiny of the finest microscope. Why did I do that exactly? Was
that my highest expression? How could I have done that better with a
greater sense of personal Rightness?
-
Fourthly, when we're beginning to act usually in this kind of open
transparency, we may invite the Team to work with us simply by
opening our hearts to them and the possibility of higher truth
unfolding within and through us.
-
Finally, communion with the nine happens
through simple inner joy of a 'knowing attunement' to rightness in
our lives. It may be felt as a simple synchronistic exchange with a
bird, in the lyrics of a song, the words of a friend, the metaphor
in a film. Or it could be a peak experience which shatters you to
the core of your being. It depends how ready we are. Their
communication knows no limitation of false grandeur.
In this way, we can all open a 'bridge' to the
Team and they will benevolently and gladly connect with us across it.
That
is their purpose. They are willingly here for us, especially now,
in these monumental times of profound change...
