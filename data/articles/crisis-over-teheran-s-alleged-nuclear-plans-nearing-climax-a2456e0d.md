Time after time we have heard statements from
Israeli officials, spokesmen of the Israel lobby in the U.S., and Israels
supporters in Congress that Iran must never obtain nuclear weapons. On
March 3, 2008, all five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus
nine of the ten non-permanent members approved a new round of sanctions
against Iran.
Chalk up the final vote of 14-0 with one
abstention (the Muslim nation of Indonesia) as another victory at the U.N.
for the Israel-U.S. partnership.
The spectacle of the five permanents in the antiquated Security Council
hierarchy - all of whom refuse to eliminate their own nuclear weapons -
adopting a double standard with respect to Iran does not, of course, raise
more than a peep in the mainstream media of the U.S.
Iran, a nation of proud people in a neighborhood
of proud peoples, sees only absurdity in the discrimination against it when
the nearby nations of India, Pakistan, and Israel have all developed their
own nuclear weapons without the U.S. stopping them. Israels nuclear weapons
program particularly sticks in the Iranian craw, because Iranians know that
Israel, an enemy but a far smaller country, acquired nuclear weapons over 40
years ago, considerably earlier than either India or Pakistan.
Most Iranians also know that Israel accomplished
this only with public and/or private aid from the U.S. Its all seen as just
one more example of the U.S. favoring Israel and picking on Iran.
The issue of the moment is not even actual production of nuclear weapons by
Iran, but the enrichment of natural uranium so that it contains a higher
percentage of one particular uranium isotope, U-235, than is found in nature
when the ore called uranium is first mined. Such enrichment provides the
single most-difficult-to-obtain product used in most nuclear weapons.
(In the natural state, the raw ore contains
other uranium isotopes as well, and usually has by volume less than one
percent U-235. When concentrated to around three percent U-235, the product
is widely used in common forms of nuclear power reactors. When concentrated
to much higher levels - 90 percent is the figure often cited - the product
becomes the weapons-grade material used in nuclear weapons. The equipment
used in this enrichment process is not only complicated to build, manage
and maintain; it also requires large amounts of electric power to operate.
But all of this is within the capabilities of numerous nations and, probably
increasingly, some subnational groups as well.)
Iran now possesses, has tested, and is using all the equipment required, and
it has the necessary electric power, to produce enriched uranium. It claims
it has already reached an enrichment level of around four percent U-235 in
early tests. It also claims that it does not want nuclear weapons and will
use the enriched uranium only to produce larger amounts of electric power
for the nation in a series of nuclear power plants.
But if one chooses to believe that Iran really
wants nuclear weapons, another element comes into the equation: the ease
with which an enrichment operation can be converted to produce weapons-grade
uranium. Various Western experts commonly believe that if a nation or group
is capable of going from less than one percent to a three or four percent
enrichment level, then the technical difficulties of moving from three or
four to 90 percent enrichment are not at all major.
The actual design and manufacture of the explosive device, and then of a
deliverable weapon, would not be a simple task, but neither would it be
terribly difficult. Precise estimates of the time the entire process might
take are generally useless. There are too many variables. All such estimates
depend heavily on the types of delivery systems available, the degree of
targeting accuracy demanded, and the redundancy, or lack, of safety features
assumed necessary to prevent unauthorized or accidental use.
But for Iran, a simple guess of three or four
years probably would be in the ball park.
While the U.S. and other nations demand that Iran cease all production of
enriched uranium, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) that came into
effect in 1970 does not prevent anyone from enriching uranium for peaceful
purposes. Iran, as already noted, claims that is all it is presently doing,
and there is no hard evidence to the contrary.
The U.S., however, and most other signatories of
the treaty who already possess nuclear weapons have made no serious efforts
to work toward global nuclear and general disarmament as called for in the
NPT. The treaty, of course, has no timetable or deadlines in it. But the
fact that the major powers who signed the treaty have not even begun
multilateral negotiations on nuclear disarmament in 38 years gives Iran a
good excuse, if it needs one, to abrogate its participation in the treaty.
Some day Iran may do just that.
The fact that Israel, India, and Pakistan, who
have refused to sign the treaty from the start, have now become known
nuclear powers, gives leaders in Teheran yet another excuse to get out of
the NPT if it wishes.
While some U.S. empire builders talk about the need to change the global
system, the world today is still composed of legally independent states
where nationalism is the dominant force underlying relationships among
states. In such a world, it is logical to assume that Iranian leaders either
already secretly want nuclear weapons or will soon come to want them.
They will not indefinitely accept that the
smaller state of Israel has any greater right to nuclear weapons than they
have. Nor will they even accept that the much larger U.S. has a greater
right to such weapons. Short of being forced abjectly to surrender to the
U.S.-Israeli partnership, no Iranian government leaders could accept such
views.
The possibility of negotiating a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East
(including Israel), or even, conceivably, a nuclear-free world, is often
suggested as the only true final solution to the Middle Easts or the entire
globes nuclear dilemma. And the people who make such suggestions can often
cite polls or surveys showing that a majority of people everywhere support
these ideas.
The tragedy is that at the moment there is
simply not enough trust among the governments of the globe, or even within
one region thereof. Take the United States alone, or the U.S.-Israel
partnership. It is inconceivable that the present government of either
partner would be able even to begin negotiations on eliminating its nuclear
weapons, no matter what the possible benefits might be. The same would apply
to China, Russia, Britain, France, India, and Pakistan to greater or lesser
degrees.
Even in this time of distrust, however, the U.N. should set up a permanent
conference of ambassador-level experts on Disarmament and Global Crises.
Once it is up and running, spokespeople for this conference should direct
public attention on a daily basis to the relationship between arms spending
and the three major crises facing the globe - the energy, climate, and water
crises that will make it increasingly necessary for the peoples of the world
to work together in overcoming the crises and drastically cutting back the
outrageous and wasteful military expenditures of too many nations.
The immediate task of the conference should be
to define areas of agreement and disagreement on disarmament and on the
other three issues in different regions of the world. The chairperson should
be a very senior U.N. official, and the unusual feature of the conference -
its permanence - should receive great emphasis on every public occasion.
It is likely that before long new and unforeseen developments will occur in
one or more of the three crises that will intensify thinking among at least
some people about the wastefulness of present military spending.
Costly new difficulties in any of the three
areas might even lead in fairly short order to a rolling snowball of global
opposition and disgust over new nuclear spending. No one can foresee how
great will be the changes in daily life caused by the three crises but we
should, as best we can, work to make the changes add to rather than detract
from harmony among the worlds peoples.
We should all specifically try to use these
crises to encourage everyone to think first as citizens of the world, only
second as citizens of a particular nation or region.
But none of this deals with the present - or with the remaining months of
Bushs presidency.
Since the present group of Republicans and copycat
Democrats in Congress refuses to impeach Bush and Cheney, the danger of a
war against Iran instigated by the U.S. and Israel remains real. The
overextended state of U.S. ground forces, and Bushs probable willingness to
treat at least small nuclear weapons as ordinary weapons, mean that a war
would possibly not be a ground war at all, but would begin with large air
attacks and early use of nuclear weapons.
While the longer term results of using nuclear
weapons would be utterly disastrous, both for the world and for the U.S.,
the immediate results might be seen as a quick and cheap victory for the
U.S. If the apparent military victory occurred before the November 2008 U.S.
election, it would probably guarantee a Republican electoral victory.
Given Bushs interest in his own place in
history, such a scenario could easily appeal to his gambling instincts.
Noise, and lots of it, seems to be the only weapon we have to make it less
likely that such a scenario actually happens. Lets make that noise, do it
globally, and do it every day.
Pound out the message through every medium we
can access, including music and literature, that ordinary people around the
world DO NOT WANT THE U.S. AND ISRAEL TO KILL A SINGLE PERSON IN IRAN,
regardless of the status of Irans nuclear weapons program.
