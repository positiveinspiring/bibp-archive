For a brief moment,
Obama and his
banker bosses
met the world and the world punched Obama in the mouth.
Through our
collective efforts, with regard to Syria, average people have made every
elitist banker blink and these gangsters have temporarily backed up.
However, one's work is never done, because what do military historians
advise generals to do following a big victory?
They advise them to follow up
on that victory and smash their enemy.
This is precisely what humanity needs
to do with regard to the recent positive events involving Obamas plans to
attack Syria.
We Have Bought About Two Months Of Time
Both my insider
sources and some of my prominent colleagues in the alternative media are now
reporting that Obama may have to wait as long as eight weeks, or more, to
launch a decisive military strike against Syria.
To our foreign friends and
our fellow countrymen, I say take a bow as we have won some breathing room,
but we must press on.
Syrian Officials Waste No Time Claiming Victory
Syrias official newspaper, al-Thawra, stated in a front-page editorial on
Saturday that,
Obama announced yesterday, directly or through implication,
the beginning of the historic American retreat.
Syrian Deputy Foreign
Minister Faisal Mekdad stated that Obama is showing signs of indecision.
Even the British Parliament rejected the Obama war initiative against Syria.
Assad and the Syrian people
have shown great resiliency.
Recent polls show that American citizens are against this war by a 9 to 1
ratio.
One of the major players in what was to be the upcoming attacks,
France, has been clamoring for war against Syria for quite some time. France
lost control over Syria in 1946 as they were unable to hold on to their
colony following World War II.
Of course, the French have not won a military
battle since the early 19th century and with Obama meeting significant
roadblocks they are unwilling to enter the conflict alone. This is a wise
choice for the French, because they simply couldnt fight their way out of a
wet paper bag.
For the moment, the Assad-led Syrian government remains in
power.
The Beginning of Syrian Normalcy?
Since Obama
has waffled on attacking Syria this past weekend, Syria has somewhat
returned to normal, or at least as normal as things could be under the dire
circumstances in which the United States has placed them.
Skull and Bones Alumnus John
Kerry tells the media,
the truth is as we say it
is.
However, any news
of peace is not welcome news to the globalist-serving minions such as
Secretary of State,
John Kerry, who stated that sarin gas has been found in chemical weapons residue in Damascus, and this implicates Assad as being the source of the chemical weapons attack.
That is like saying that a gun has been found at the scene of a homicide and the ownership of the gun can be ascribed to whatever political enemy deemed necessary. But apparently, that is Secretary Kerry’s story and he is sticking with it.
Yet, Kerry’s logic is so horribly flawed.
Why would Assad do the one thing that would allow the United States and her allies to wage war on Syria based on a pretext provided by Assad himself?
Further, the chemical weapons attack occurred in a residential area under the control of the rebels. Assad is not stupid and he would never hand a loaded gun to Obama. Further, the chemical weapons target had no military value. In other words, there was nothing to gain for Assad to have launched the attack.
However, we should not confuse Obama and Kerry with the facts.
There is also nothing, in reality, for America to gain by attacking Syria.
Fourteen hundred people died in chemical weapons attacks.
-
How many more Syrian people will an Obama air campaign kill?
-
Would it be 10,000, 50,000, 100,000 or two million?
-
Because Assad is falsely accused of killing 1,400 of his own people, then does this give Obama the right to kill tens of thousands of Syrians in response?
-
And the American people are seriously listening to this nonsensical reasoning?
There is one decisive question that has never been asked and answered in all the discussions that I have read with regard to the chemical weapons attacks.
If Obama was facing an overthrow at home, does anyone seriously think that he would not hesitate to use chemical weapons against his potential enemies, the American people?
What does this say about the quality of our leadership when Kerry and Obama
are not even clever enough to fabricate a believable cover story.
The Real Culprit
It is obvious to most neutral observers that the most that the CIA backed al-Qaeda led rebels could hope to achieve in the Syrian Civil War was a stalemate.
Consequently, Obama needed a game changer because, as I have pointed out in several recent articles, the bankers are holding no less than six Watergate-type scandals (e.g. Benghazi) over Obama’s head as they blackmail him into producing results in the Middle East, which will culminate in saving the petrodollar.
The game-changing event that Obama needed appears to most of us in the alternative media to consist of a false flag chemical weapons attack which could be used to implicate Assad.
Of course, in this scenario, this event would be followed by military strikes which would be launched against Syria and a regime change would surely take place.
The United Nations can
investigate the event all they want, however, they will never be able to determine which side did it to any degree of certainty unless they are in on the fix.
Syrians in the US Are Fighting Back
All across the nation, people are marching in opposition to the coming war in Syria.
Over 300 people rallied and marched in Chicago, last Thursday, as they collectively said,
“Hands off Syria!”
This was in response to the U.S. threat of a military attack. There is a very encouraging aspect of what happened at the Chicago protests. Only half of the people present were estimated to be Syrians.
There were people of all backgrounds marching in the protests including Muslims, Christians, Assyrians, Arabs, atheists and other people of all backgrounds who are growing weary of the tyrannical bankers imposing their will on innocent people.
Also present was the Syrian American Forum (SAF).
The SAF is a group that has worked over the past several years to try to
prevent U.S. intervention in their country. The anti-war groups in
attendance were also very diverse which included,
-
the Anti-War Committee
-
Chicago (AWC)
-
ANSWER Coalition
-
the March 19th Committee
There were also members from the Iraq Veterans Against the War.
Syria constitutes the perfect victim. Even the state-run media outlet, CNN, identifies the Syrian rebels' link to al-Qaeda (see the screen shot below).
With al-Qaeda involved how far behind can the CIA and ultimately
the Muslim Brotherhood be? The Syrian government and their people are not an aggressive people.
In Middle Eastern terms, they are a somewhat moderate regime, albeit a dictatorship. Assad is supported by the majority of his people who also do not believe the chemical weapons allegations.
All of this adds up to a case of unnecessary victimization by the Obama administration.

And whatever the Obama administration will do to the Syrians on behalf of the bankers, they will surely do to people anywhere, including the United States when it is their/our turn to become a proxy villain in the name of resource reallocation.
Does anyone else see what is happening here? The rank and file of the people on this planet have a real opportunity to stand up to
the banksters and push back with great force.
The world is not going to collectively organize against,
...or most any other issues which has humanity fragmented.
However, all human beings understand what it is like to be bullied and most people don’t like it.
The Syrian American Forum
Protests against the Syrian war have taken place all across the country and the diversity of the protesters is stunning.
The organizing element for most of these protests is the
Syrian American Forum and they are the perfect place to start a nonviolent revolution against the bankers as they have good organizational capabilities as evidenced in the nationwide protest efforts.
I would suggest going to their contact page and offer to help.
We need to make T-shirts, bumper stickers and provide publicity for their efforts. I would ask my friends in the alternative media to help in this endeavor as this opportunity, to uniformly oppose the bankers, may never come again.
The Syrian American Forum (SAF) can be contacted at this
site.
We can derail the globalists on this issue and this issue could galvanize people to stand up to these globalist thugs on other issues as well.
The SAF advocates for the following
reforms:
-
Syrian National Reconciliation and Unity through dialogue.
-
Promoting reforms.
-
Rejection of violence and foreign intervention.
-
A Secular Syria based on the coexistence mosaic of the Syrian society.
These are very easy initiatives to rally behind.
The Syrian people are quickly showing the world that they are the only party in this conflict who still possess any degree of humanity.
Conclusion
Humanity needs to collectively organize to reject the use of force against Syria.
I am not keen on contacting Congress these days, but this is one exception I think everyone should make. Syria could become our rallying cry for freedom on a global scale.
Karl Marx once said that before a successful revolution can be launched, a collective consciousness must be achieved.
Thomas Paine accomplished this goal with the publication of his pamphlet Common Sense. This opportunity may not come again for humanity to stand against bankers tyranny on a united front.
We have already won the first battle, we need to continue to take the fight the oppressors of humanity.
At the end of the day, humanity may not prevail, but this issue gives us the opportunity to go down fighting with our dignity and humanity intact.
It is up to us and we do not have long to act.
