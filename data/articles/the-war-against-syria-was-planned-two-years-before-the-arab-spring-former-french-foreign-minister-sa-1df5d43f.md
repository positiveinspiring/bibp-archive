In an interview with the French TV station LCP,
former French minister for Foreign Affairs Roland Dumas said:
Im going to tell you something. I was in
England two years before the violence in Syria on other business. I met
with top British officials, who confessed to me that they were preparing
something in Syria.
This was in Britain not in America. Britain was organizing an invasion
of rebels into Syria. They even asked me, although I was no longer
minister for foreign affairs, if I would like to participate.
Naturally, I refused, I said Im French, that doesnt interest me.
Dumas went on give the audience a quick lesson
on the real reason for the war that has now claimed the lives of tens of
thousands of people.
This operation goes way back. It was
prepared, preconceived and planned
in the region it is important to
know that this Syrian regime has a very anti-Israeli stance.
Consequently, everything that moves in the region- and I have this from
the former Israeli prime minister who told me well try to get on with
our neighbors but those who dont agree with us will be destroyed.
Its a type of politics, a view of history, why not after all. But one
should know about it.
Dumas is a retired French foreign minister who
is obliged to use discretion when revealing secrets which could affect
French foreign policy.
That is why he made the statement,
I am French, that doesnt interest me.
He could not reveal Frances role in the British
plan as he would be exposing himself to prosecution for revealing state
secrets.
There have been many disinformation agents in the British and French press,
many of them well known leftist war correspondents and commentators, who
have tried to pretend that Israel secretly supports Assad. Those who make
such arguments are either stupid, ignorant or deliberate disinformation
agents of NATO and Israel.
Israels support for Al Qaeda militants in Syria has even been admitted by
the mainstream press.
For example, Germanys Die Welt newspaper
published a report on June 12th on Israels medical treatment of
the Al Qaeda fighters.
Israel planned this war of annihilation years ago in accordance with
the Yinon Plan, which advocates
balkanization of all states that pose a threat to Israel. The Zionist entity
is using Britain and France to goad the reluctant Obama administration into
sending more American troops to their death in Syria on behalf of Tel Aviv.
Of all the aggressor states against Syria, Israel has been the quietest from
the start.
That is because Laurent Fabius,
Francois Holland, William Hague and David Cameron are
doing their bidding by attempting to drag Israels American Leviathan into
another ruinous war so that Israel can get control of the Middle Easts
energy reserves, eventually replacing the United States as the ruling state
in the world.
It has also been necessary for Tel Aviv to
remain silent so as not to expose their role in the revolutions, given the
fact that the Jihadist fanatics dont realize they are fighting for Israel.
This is the ideology of Zionism which cares no more for Jews than it does
for its perceived enemies. The Jewish colony is determined to become a
ruling state in the Middle East in the insane delusion that this will enable
it to replace the United States as a global hegemon, once the US collapses
fighting Israels wars.
Israeli Prime Minister once told American talk show host Bill Maher that the
reason why Israel always wins short conflicts, while the United States gets
bogged down in endless wars.
The secret is that we have America, he
said.
But Israel is itself slowly collapsing.
If one excludes the enslaved Palestinian
population, the Jewish state still has the highest level of poverty in the
developed world with more and more Jews choosing to leave the promised
land, a garrison state led by mad men, an anti-Semitic entity threatening to
engulf the world in war and destruction. Israel cares no more about its own
working class Jews than any other ethnic community.
In fact, if the Likudnik crooks running the Israeli colony get their way,
working class Israelis will be among the first to pay as they are
conscripted to fight terrorists created by their own government.
With orthodox Jews protesting in the streets of
New York against Israel and Haredi Jewish minority opposing Israels rampant
militarism, Zionism is coming under increased attack from Jewish religious
authorities and non-Zionist Jews both inside and outside of the occupied
territories.
This is not the first time that Roland Dumas has spoken out against wars of
aggression waged by successive French regimes. In 2011 he revealed that he
had been asked by the United States when he was foreign minister in the
Mitterrand administration to organize the bombing of Libya. On that occasion
the French refused to cooperate.
Dumas, a lawyer by profession, offered to defend
Colonel Gaddafi, at the International Criminal Court in the event of his
arrest by NATO.
Dumas was also vocal in condemning Frances brutal neo-colonial bombing of
the Ivory Coast earlier in 2011, were death squads and terrorists similar to
those later deployed in Libya and Syria were unleashed upon the Ivoirian
population in order to install a IMF puppet dictator Alassane Quattara
in power.
Gbagbo was described as one of the
greatest African leaders of the past 20 years by Jean Ziegler,
sociologist and former member of the Advisory Committee of the UN Human
Rights Council.
Gbagbo had plans to nationalize banks and wrest control of the countrys
currency from the colonial finance institutions in Paris. He also wanted to
roll back many of the worst effects of IMF restructuring by nationalizing
industries and creating a functioning, universal free health service.
All of this threatened the interests of French
corporations in the former French colony. So, the Parisian oligarchy went to
work to find a suitable replacement as caretaker of their Ivoirian colony.
They sent in armed terrorist gangs, or rebels in the doublespeak of
imperialism, who murdered all before them while the French media blamed
president Gbagbo for the violence that ensued. Gbagbo and Gaddafi had
opposed Africom, the Pentagons plan to recolonize Africa.
That was another reason for the 2011 bombing of
their two African countries.
The formula is always the same. Imperialism backs rebels, whenever its
interests are threatened by regimes that love their country more than
foreign corporations. One should not forgot that during the Spanish Civil
War of 1936, General Franco and his cronies were also rebels and they,
like their counterparts in Libya in 2011, were bombed to power by foreign
powers, replacing a progressive, republican administration with fascism.
There are pro-Israeli fanatics in France who have used the analogy of the
Spanish Civil War as justification for intervention in Libya and Syria. The
pseudo-philosopher Henry Bernard Levy is one of them.
Of course, the ignoramus Levy doesnt realize
that the reason France, England and the USA did not officially intervene in
the Spanish Civil War is because they were covertly helping the rebels
from the start. They enabled arms shipments to the Francoist rebels while
preventing arms deliveries to the Spanish government, who, like Syria today,
were helped by Moscow.
Anyone who has studied the Spanish Civil War
knows that all the imperialist countries wanted Franco as a bulwark against
communism.
There is nothing imperialism loves more than a rebel without a cause. What
imperialism hates, however, are revolutionaries. That is why the rebels
which imperialism sends into other countries to colonize them on behalf of
foreign banks and corporations, have to be marketed as revolutionaries in
order to assure the support of the Monty Python brigade of petty-bourgeois,
leftist dupes such as Democracy Now! and their ilk.
Dumas is not the only top French official to denounce
the
New World Order.
Former French ambassador to Syria Michel
Raimbaud wrote a book in 2012 entitled Le Soudan dans tous les états,
where he revealed how Israel planned and instigated a civil war in South
Sudan in order to balkanize a country led by a pro-Palestinian government.
He also exposed the pro-Israeli media groups and
human rights NGOS who created the humanitarian narrative calling for
military intervention by the United States in the conflict.
The subject was covered extensively by African investigative journalist
Charles Onana in his 2009 book, Al-Bashir & Darfour LA CONTRE ENQUÊTE.
There are many more retired French officials who are speaking out about the
ruinous policies of this French government, including the former head of
French domestic intelligence Yves Bonnet. There have also been
reports of dissent in the French armed forces and intelligence apparatus.
After
the assassination of Colonel Gaddafi
in October 2011, the former French ambassador to Libya Christian Graeff
told French radio station France Culture that it was responsible for the
diffusion of lies and war propaganda on behalf of NATO throughout the war.
Graeff also warned the broadcasters that such
disinformation could only work on the minds of serfs but not in a country of
free minds.
The power of the Israeli lobby in France is a subject rarely discussed in
polite circles. In France there is a law against questioning or denial of
the holocaust. However, denial of the Korean holocaust, Guatemalan
holocaust, Palestinian holocaust, Indonesian holocaust and the dozens of
other US/Israeli supported genocides is not only perfectly legal but is the
respectable norm.
The same lobby which introduced the Loi Gayssot in 1990, effectively ending
freedom of expression in France, would also like to ban any independent
investigations of genocides whose narratives they have written, such as the
Rwanda genocide, where Israel played a key role in supporting the rebels
led by Paul Kagame, who invaded Rwanda from Uganda from 1991 to 1994,
leading to the genocide of both Tutus and Tutsis.
Many serious scholars have written about the
Rwandan genocide, which the Israel lobby repeatedly uses as a case study to
justify humanitarian intervention by Western powers.
The Zionist thought police would like to see
such authors prosecuted for negating imperialisms disgusting lies on
African conflicts.
Now, the Israeli Lobby is forcing the (their) French government to prosecute
twitter messages which the lobby deems anti-Semitic. This is one further
step towards the creation of a totalitarian state where any criticism of
imperialism, foreign wars, racism, oppression, perhaps eventually capitalism
itself could fall under the rubric of anti-Semitism.
These people are sick, and those who cow down to them are sicker. Perhaps
the etymology of sickness, a word cognate with the German Sicherheit
(security) according to dictionary.com, is not a coincidence.
For what is particularly sick about our society
is the cult of security, endless surveillance, ubiquitous cameras, the cult
of the all seeing eye, the prurient gaze as part of the incessant discourse
on terrorism by those who specialize in the training of the very terrorists
they claim to be protecting us from.
Whether or not the words security and sickness
are linguistically related, they are certainly cognate in a philosophical
sense.
Roland Dumas and others like him should be highly commended for having to
guts to say what so many others are too morally corrupt, too weak and
cowardly to admit.
As the French government and its media agencies drum up hysteria for war on
Syria, Roland Dumas, now in the twilight of his years, is warning people of
the consequences of not understanding where Israel is leading the world.
Will enough people heed the warning?
