Like an axe poised above one's neck at execution, the despotic hereditary
regimes of Saudi Arabia and Qatar have the specter of their own US-fueled
"Arab Springs" looming over them, ever ready to be triggered.
A constant
reminder of this is the destabilized Sunni royal family in Bahrain, in the
epicenter of Saudi and Qatari power.

Bahrain, like Saudi
Arabia and Qatar, is a despotic Sunni monarchy - selected by
the West to be made an example of and to keep its neighbors
in check and on board for the current "Arab Spring"
blitzkrieg upturning the rest of the Arab World.
The Bahrain protests, like those of Egypt,
Libya, Syria, Myanmar, North Korea, Thailand, and beyond, were trained,
equipped, and supported by the US State Department.
Leading opposition
organizations, such as
the US-based "Witness Bahrain" and Bahrain Center for
Human Rights, are partnered directly with US State Department-funded fronts
like the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) while a
high-profile self-proclaimed leader of the protests, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja,
was regional
coordinator of "Frontline Defenders," a,
...funded "human rights" advocacy group.
Al-Khawaja is now carrying
out a "hunger strike" while in prison.

Line Defenders - yet another disingenuous "human rights"
advocacy front funded by Fortune 500 corporate foundations,
including the US State Department-funded
Neo-Conservative-lined Freedom House, Wall Street speculator
George Soros' Open Society Institute, the Ford Foundation,
the Oak Foundation, and the Sigrid Rausing Trust.
Note the
"Hunger Strike for Freedom" banner on the right-hand side
for Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja.
The Bahrain protests are a
carbon-copy Western destabilization as seen in Tunisia,
Egypt, Libya, and Syria. (click on image to enlarge)
Al-Khawaja has received the full support of of
his Frontline Defender sponsors, including Freedom House who has even
farcically changed their Twitter icon into a "Save Al-Khawaja" banner and
has been relentlessly tweeting as of late in regards to the "pro-democracy"
struggle in Bahrain.
As noted, Freedom House is anything but a "human
rights" advocacy organization, and is instead leveraging the cause of human
rights for overtly self-serving corporate-financier global hegemonic
objectives.
Video: Noam Chomsky in 1993 on
the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), Freedom House's
umbrella organization:
"It's about what you would expect
from a bipartisan democracy campaign - it's an attempt to
impose what is called democracy, meaning rule by the rich
and the powerful, without interference by the mob but within
the framework of formal electoral procedures."
As covered in "NED & Freedom House are run by
Warmongering Imperialists," Freedom House, in tandem with its umbrella
organization, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED -
which funds
directly the Bahrain Human Rights Society) are run by some of the most overt
warmongers and corporate-financier interests imaginable and have
demonstratively abused their positions within so-called "human rights" and
"democracy promotion" organizations to outright topple targeted nations.

House's Twitter page as of April 11, 2012, shows a "Save Al-Khawaja"
icon where Freedom House's own logo is usually seen.
Freedom
House, a notorious Neo-Conservative front, has been
uncharacteristically focused on Bahrain lately in tandem
with the Foreign Policy Initiative (FPI), the reincarnation
of William Kristol's Neo-Conservative Project for a New
American Century (PNAC).
Coincidentally, pressuring Saudi
Arabia and Qatar's neighboring monarchy seems to coincide
with Washington's requests for Saudi and Qatari support with
military operations verses first Libya, and now Syria.
Joining Freedom House in a recent torrent of
attention given to the often neglected protests in Bahrain, is the Foreign
Policy Initiative (FPI) which is for all intents and purposes the Project
for a New American Century's (PNAC) latest reincarnation.
Notorious
Neo-Conservatives,

Ellen Bork

Jamie Fly,
...all of whom operate in and out of Fortune
500-funded think-tanks like the Brookings Institution, Harvard's Belfer
Center, and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) - constitute FPI's
membership and churn out primarily pro-war endorsements, just as PNAC did
before it.
Their most recent work involved
promoting the NATO-led
evisceration of Libya and its handing over to Al Qaeda's Libyan Islamic
Fighting Group (LIFG). They now seek a repeat performance in Syria.

14 Uprising: What's Next for Bahrain?" US State Department
funded POMED and Neo-Con meddlers of FPI converge to
conspire over Bahrain's future in the US-engineered "Arab
Spring."
FPI in February of 2012 held an event titled,
"The Unfinished February 14 Uprising: What's Next for Bahrain?" in
partnership with the National Endowment for Democracy-funded propaganda
front Project on Middle East Democracy (POMED).
Speakers included Neo-Con
Elliott Abrams of the CFR and Joost Hiltermann of the Soros-funded
International Crisis Group (ICG) which played a pivotal role in
the
destabilization of Tunisia, Egypt, and Syria.

11, 2012 Tweet regarding its collaboration with NED-funded
POMED in calling for the release of US-backed Bahraini
opposition leader al-Khawaja from prison.
FPI, in tandem
with NED and Freedom House have been uncharacteristically
interested in Bahrain lately, coincidentally, just as they
need Saudi and Qatari backing for another push against
Syria.
Bahrain is Washington's point of leverage against
these two Sunni monarchies. (click image to enlarge)
The sense one gets from listening to the 90
minute FPI-POMED event is of stretching out the conflagration in Bahrain for
as long as possible while ultimately threatening neighboring Saudi Arabia.
And while Bahrain has, like Libya, Syria, and Egypt responded to street
violence with security forces wielding deadly force, Bahrain is not spoken
of in the same "dire" and "urgent" terms as Libya, Syria, or Egypt were.
Panel members at the event note that the fate of Bahrain is tied directly to
that of the Saudis, and that the survival of the Bahraini Al Khalifa royal
family is "existentially" linked to the House of Saud. Certainly then, US
subversion turned up sufficiently as to overthrow the Al Khalifa family
would in turn "existentially" threaten the Sauds who are themselves sitting
upon a powder keg of instability resultant from decades of despotic rule.
Saudi Arabia's stability is owed to its immense security apparatus,
constructed, armed, and funded by the United States.
In many instances, the
US has
cooperated operationally with Saudi security forces in maintaining
internal order. To simply pull the legs out from under the Saudis,
especially after allowing Bahrain to fall entirely, would be a simple
matter.
What then are the Saudis paying in return to keep this card from
being played? Where does the "soft spot" of humanitarian concerns in Bahrain
come from amongst Neo-Con warmongers within both Freedom House and FPI?
Quite clearly in the case of Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Syria, it is a crass,
clumsy pretext for naked military aggression.
In Bahrain's case, it is much
more nuanced.

Little to no mention was made across Western
media primarily because Saudi Arabia and neighboring Qatar
had already fully committed to supporting Western ambitions
in Libya.
Both Saudi Arabia and Qatar have provided
immense resources to
the West's "Arab Spring" blitzkrieg starting in
Tunisia, across Libya and Egypt, and now embroiling Syria.
Qatar provided
troops, aircraft, arms, and cash for Libyan terrorists as they swept the
government from power and has throughout the "Arab Spring" provided 24/7
propaganda via Qatari government
run Al Jazeera, which masquerades as a news
agency.
Tellingly, "requests" for
Saudi arms and support for US-led NATO
operations against Libya came in tandem with news of a planned "day of rage"
aimed at Saudi's ruling family. The date came and went with little
consequence, after Saudi Arabia and Qatar pledged full support against
Qaddafi.
Similarly in Syria, both kingdoms are likewise providing arms and cash, and
even "wages" for Syrian terrorists to take up arms against the Syrian
government.
And as the next step comes for Syria, backing NATO-member Turkey
in establishing Washington prescribed "safe havens" and "humanitarian
corridors" in a Libya-style escalation, the West has begun to predictably
turn the screws on Bahrain.
Image: From the beginning, the
uprising in Bahrain bore all the markings of the
US-engineered "Arab Spring" sweeping the Arab World. Even
the CIA-funded "Otpor-fist" would find its way into
Bahrain's protests.
It is quite clear then that Saudi and Qatari
support for the US-engineered "Arab Spring" is born not out of
altruism or
fellowship, but out of fear for their own survival, with unrest already
being triggered and encouraged by the West in at least Saudi Arabia, and
with Bahrain resigned to a slow burn, briefly fanned by the West at
junctures such as these, where a great amount of support is required against
Syria to overcome recent setbacks.
It is difficult to sympathize with either
Qatar or Saudi Arabia, who have committed as much in the betrayal of their
neighbors on behalf of Wall Street and London as they have against their own
people.
One wonders if amidst their spectacular betrayal of their Arab
brothers, whether or not they realize they are next when Syria and Iran
falls. There are no seats at the tables on Wall Street or in London for the
despotic regimes of Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
Ultimately, their
self-preservation lies in both reforming themselves and balking foreign
meddling in their backyard - not facilitating it.
