"A part of the fortune of the
Queen of England
comes from drug trafficking."
Jacques Cheminade
candidate for the 2012
French presidential election
Britains financial regulator
has fined the British queens bank
for money laundering failures
as a French presidential candidate has said
part of the queens fortune
comes from drug trafficking.
The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has fined
the British queens bank,
Coutts Bank, 8.75 million pounds for failing to
carry out correct checks on politically exposed persons and prevent money
laundering.
The failings at Coutts were serious,
systemic and were allowed to persist for almost three years. They
resulted in an unacceptable risk of Coutts handling the proceeds of
crime, the FSA said in a statement posted on its official website.
The news comes less than a week after a fringe
candidate for Aprils French presidential election said the British queen
owed her fortune to drugs money laundered by Jewish bankers in The City.
On 21 March, Jacques Cheminade, an independent presidential candidate
running in the French election, said,
a part of the fortune of the Queen of
England comes from drug trafficking.
No, not any property, there are several other sources. But it is a
series of trafficking in which, yes, there is trafficking drugs,
Cheminade said on television LCP French National Assembly.
Known as the British queens banker, Coutts was
criticized for significant, widespread and unacceptable failures, as
described by Tracey McDermott, acting director of enforcement and
financial crime.
The size of the financial penalty
demonstrates how seriously we view its failures, McDermott said.
