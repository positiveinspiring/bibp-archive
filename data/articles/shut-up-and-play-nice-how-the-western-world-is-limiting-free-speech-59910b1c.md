Free speech is dying in the Western world.
While most people still enjoy considerable
freedom of expression, this right, once a near-absolute, has become less
defined and less dependable for those espousing controversial social,
political or religious views.
The decline of free speech has come not from any
single blow but rather from thousands of paper cuts of well-intentioned
exceptions designed to maintain social harmony.
In the face of the violence that frequently
results from anti-religious expression, some world leaders seem to be losing
their patience with free speech.
After a video called Innocence of Muslims
appeared on YouTube and sparked
violent protests in several Muslim nations last month, U.N. Secretary
General Ban Ki-moon warned that,
when some people use this freedom of
expression to provoke or humiliate some others values and beliefs, then
this cannot be protected.
It appears that the one thing modern society can
no longer tolerate is intolerance.
As Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard
put it in her recent speech before the United Nations,
Our tolerance must never extend to
tolerating religious hatred.
A willingness to confine free speech in the name
of social pluralism can be seen at various levels of authority and
government.
In February, for instance, Pennsylvania Judge
Mark Martin heard a case in which a Muslim man was charged with attacking an
atheist marching in a Halloween parade as a zombie Muhammed.
Martin castigated not the defendant but the
victim, Ernie Perce, lecturing him that,
our forefathers intended to use the First
Amendment so we can speak with our mind, not to piss off other people
and cultures - which is what you did.
Of course, free speech is often precisely about
pissing off other people - challenging social taboos or political values.
This was evident in recent days when courts in
Washington and New York ruled that transit authorities could not prevent or
delay the posting of a controversial ad that says:
In any war between the civilized man and
the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat jihad.
When U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer
said the government
could not bar the ad simply because it could upset some Metro riders,
the ruling prompted calls for new limits on such speech.
And in New York, the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority responded by unanimously passing a new regulation banning any
message that it considers likely to incite others or cause some other
immediate breach of the peace.
Such efforts focus not on the right to speak but
on the possible reaction to speech - a fundamental change in the treatment
of free speech in the West. The much-misconstrued statement of Justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes that free speech does not give you the right to
shout fire in a crowded theater is now being used to curtail speech that
might provoke a violence-prone minority.
Our entire society is being treated as a crowded
theater, and talking about whole subjects is now akin to shouting fire!
The new restrictions are forcing people to meet
the demands of the lowest common denominator of accepted speech, usually
using one of four rationales.
Speech is blasphemous
This is the oldest threat to free speech, but it
has experienced something of a comeback in the 21st century.
After protests erupted throughout the Muslim
world in 2005 over
Danish cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad, Western
countries publicly professed fealty to free speech, yet quietly cracked down
on anti-religious expression.
Religious critics in France, Britain, Italy
and other countries have found themselves under criminal investigation as
threats to public safety.
In France, actress and animal rights activist
Brigitte Bardot has been fined several times for comments about how Muslims
are undermining French culture. And just last month, a Greek atheist was
arrested for insulting a famous monk by making his name sound like that of a
pasta dish.
Some Western countries have classic blasphemy
laws - such as Ireland, which in 2009 criminalized the,
publication or utterance of blasphemous
matter deemed, grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters
held sacred by any religion.
The Russian Duma recently proposed a law against
insulting religious beliefs.
Other countries allow the arrest of people who
threaten strife by criticizing religions or religious leaders. In Britain,
for instance, a 15-year-old girl was arrested two years ago
for burning a Koran.
Western governments seem to be sending the
message that free speech rights will not protect you - as shown clearly last
month by the images of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula,
the YouTube filmmaker, being carted away in California on suspicion of
probation violations.
Dutch politician Geert Wilders went
through years of litigation before he was acquitted last year on charges of
insulting Islam by voicing anti-Islamic views. In the Netherlands and Italy,
cartoonists and comedians have been charged with insulting religion through
caricatures or jokes.
Even the Obama administration
supported the passage of a resolution in the U.N. Human Rights Council
to create an international standard restricting some anti-religious speech
(its full name: Combating Intolerance, Negative Stereotyping and
Stigmatization of, and Discrimination, Incitement to Violence and Violence
Against, Persons Based on Religion or Belief).
Egypts U.N. ambassador heralded the resolution
as exposing the true nature of free speech and recognizing that freedom
of expression has been sometimes misused to insult religion.
At a Washington conference last year to
implement the resolution, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
declared that it would protect both,
the right to practice ones religion freely
and the right to express ones opinion without fear.
But it isnt clear how speech can be protected
if the yardstick is how people react to speech - particularly in countries
where people riot over a single cartoon.
Clinton suggested that free speech resulting in,
sectarian clashes or the destruction or the defacement or the vandalization of religious sites was not, as she put it, fair game.
Given this initiative,
President Obamas U.N. address last month declaring Americas support
for free speech, while laudable, seemed confused - even at odds with his
administrations efforts.
Speech is hateful
In the United States, hate speech is presumably
protected under the First Amendment.
However, hate-crime laws often redefine hateful
expression as a criminal act. Thus, in 2003, the Supreme Court addressed the
conviction of a Virginia Ku Klux Klan member who burned a cross on private
land. The court allowed for criminal penalties so long as the government
could show that the act was intended to intimidate others.
It was a distinction without meaning, since the
state can simply cite the intimidating history of that symbol.
Other Western nations routinely bar forms of
speech considered hateful. Britain prohibits any abusive or insulting
words meant to stir up racial hatred. Canada outlaws any writing, sign
or visible representation that incites hatred against any identifiable
group.
These laws ban speech based not only on its
content but on the reaction of others. Speakers are often called to answer
for their divisive or insulting speech before bodies like the Canadian Human
Rights Tribunal.
This month, a Canadian court ruled that Marc Lemire, the webmaster of a far-right political site, could be punished for
allowing third parties to leave insulting comments about homosexuals and
blacks on the site.
Echoing the logic behind blasphemy laws, Federal
Court Justice Richard Mosley ruled that,
the minimal harm caused... to freedom of
expression is far outweighed by the benefit it provides to vulnerable
groups and to the promotion of equality.
Speech is discriminatory
Perhaps the most rapidly expanding limitation on
speech is found in anti-discrimination laws.
Many Western countries have extended such laws
to public statements deemed insulting or derogatory to any group, race or
gender.
For example, in a closely watched case last
year, a French court found fashion designer John Galliano guilty
of making discriminatory comments in a Paris bar, where he got into a
cursing match with a couple using sexist and anti-Semitic terms.
Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud read a list of
the bad words Galliano had used, adding that she found (rather implausibly)
he had said dirty whore at least 1,000 times. Though he faced up to six
months in jail, he was fined.
In Canada, comedian Guy Earle was charged with
violating the human rights of a lesbian couple after he got into a
trash-talking session with a group of women during an open-mike night at a
nightclub.
Lorna Pardysaid she suffered post-traumatic
stress because of Earles profane language and derogatory terms for
lesbians. The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal ruled last year that
since this was a matter of discrimination, free speech was not a defense,
and awarded about $23,000 to the couple.
Ironically, while some religious organizations
are pushing blasphemy laws, religious individuals are increasingly targeted
under anti-discrimination laws for their criticism of homosexuals and other
groups.
In 2008, a minister in Canada was not only
forced to pay fines for uttering anti-gay sentiments but was also enjoined
from expressing such views in the future.
Speech is deceitful
In the United States, where speech is given the
most protection among Western countries, there has been a recent effort to
carve out a potentially large category to which the First Amendment would
not apply.
While we have always prosecuted people who lie
to achieve financial or other benefits, some argue that the government can
outlaw any lie, regardless of whether the liar secured any economic gain.
One such law was the
Stolen Valor Act, signed by President
George W. Bush in 2006, which made
it a crime for people to lie about receiving military honors.
The Supreme Court struck it down this year, but at least two liberal
justices, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, proposed that such
laws should have less of a burden to be upheld as constitutional. The House
responded with new legislation that would criminalize lies told with the
intent to obtain any undefined tangible benefit.
The dangers are obvious. Government officials
have long labeled whistleblowers, reporters and critics as liars who
distort their actions or words. If the government can define what is a lie,
it can define what is the truth.
For example, in February the French Supreme
Court declared unconstitutional a law that made it a crime to deny the 1915
Armenian genocide by Turkey - a characterization that Turkey steadfastly
rejects.
Despite the ruling, various French leaders
pledged to pass new measures punishing those who deny the Armenians
historical claims.
The impact of government limits on speech has
been magnified by even greater forms of private censorship. For example,
most news organizations have stopped showing images of Muhammad, though they
seem to have no misgivings about caricatures of other religious figures.
The most extreme such example was supplied by
Yale University Press, which in 2009 published a book about the Danish
cartoons titled "The
Cartoons That Shook the World" - but cut all of the cartoons so as not
to insult anyone.
The very right that laid the foundation for
Western civilization is increasingly viewed as a nuisance, if not a threat.
Whether speech is deemed inflammatory or hateful or discriminatory or simply
false, society is denying speech rights in the name of tolerance, enforcing
mutual respect through categorical censorship.
As in a troubled marriage, the West seems to be
falling out of love with free speech.
Unable to divorce ourselves from this defining
right, we take refuge instead in an awkward and forced silence.
