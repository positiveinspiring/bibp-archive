# TRUE DEMOCRACY SUMMER 2001

United Nuclear Corporation
Military nuclear applications
The elite have everything backwards. Cheap goods are produced in countries
such as China with workers starving there while billions of dollars are being
spent to produce nonsense like nuclear applications instead of paying the
workers a living wage and forcing companies like United Nuclear Corporation
to develop peaceful applications in competition with other companies. This
will lower prices for consumers because competition always does that.
The elites don't want competition because they know that prices will fall
if there is competition ending the tremendous profit that they earn from
labor. The elites want monopoly which drives prices up because when one has
a monopoly they can charge whatever they want.
They must control the laws of nations so they can't be used to prevent the
elites from obtaining enormous profit. They do this by superceding the national
laws of nations with such schemes as NAFTA, GATT, and the newest scheme,
FTAA which stands for Free Trade Area of the Americas.
Protesters have already begun serious protests over this potential disaster
for workers. The demonstration in Toronto, Ontario, Canada this spring was
over the FTAA. We must insure that the FTAA is never passed.
Tell your friends and loved ones that this is just another disaster that
the elites are determined to pass. Will we allow that?
