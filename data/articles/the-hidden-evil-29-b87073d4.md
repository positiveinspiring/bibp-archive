# The Hidden Evil - 29

Raising Awareness
There are a couple of considerations regarding what can be done about this
program.
There are things that a targeted individual can
do to survive, and there things that can be done to help stop the program.
In this chapter I will not include any suggestions on dealing with
attacks.(*)
Instead I'll focus on what I've concluded to be
the best course of action to stop this program. This is also one of the
shortest chapters because the message is simple: The reason it's called
Raising Awareness is because the best thing that can be done at this point
is to make people aware of it.
Fixing this problem and the underlying one which it's part of will require
more than the suggestions given here. A carefully planned strategy (which
this chapter doesn't provide) would be needed.(*1)
So these are just some general guidelines. It
could be argued that the infection has reached a stage where it can't be
stopped. Nevertheless, stopping it should be strived for.
There is no quick way to stop this. It is just a symptom of a growing
problem. The foundation for this dictatorship has been arranged - but
they're not there, yet. In order to completely stop it, the movement toward
a worldwide dictatorship must be stopped, and the stronghold that the
financial elite have on America must be removed. However, it is at a stage
in its development where it has gained such momentum that it will be almost
impossible to stop by any means within the existing institutional framework.
Professor Marrs sums it up this way;
"it may be too late for us to stop the men
of the Secret Brotherhood," but it's "not too late to warn as many men
and women as we can about the miserable fate that the hidden elite have
in store for them."
There are still some decent people in government
and the media, which is evident by media leaks and the government
whistleblowers that appear on talk radio shows.
If the people overseeing this were as
influential as I've outlined, then it would seem there is very little that
can be done to stop this. But this is not the case. This may sound like a
contradiction, but eastern philosophy refers to this as "cleaving the
opposites." It means that even though you understand that an evil exists and
that it will continue, so too will your desire to stop it.
Earlier I wrote that because congress is under the control of the elite, a
congressional investigation would be whitewashed.
Although this is true, if enough people knew
that this program existed and what it's part of - and acted - then maybe,
maybe - that would provide the momentum to force congress to perform an
authentic investigation.
"The invisible government," commented Smoot,
"is not, however, beyond the reach of the whole Congress," that is, "if
the Congress has the spur and support of an informed public."
He adds,
"It is the people who must compel their
elected representatives to make a thorough investigation of the Council
on Foreign Relations and its interlock."
However, because the system is, literally,
rotten to the core, before a legitimate investigation can be done, the
primary mechanism that the global elite have used to control America - the
Federal Reserve - must be eliminated.
As previously demonstrated, this Invisible
Government took over America beginning in 1913 when a private corporation
was allowed gain control of the nation's money supply.
In the January 7, 1999 issue of USA Today, former US Secretary of Labor
under Bill Clinton, Robert Reich stated,
"The dirty little secret is that both houses
of Congress are irrelevant... America's domestic policy is now being run
by Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve, and America's foreign policy
is now being run by the International Monetary Fund [IMF]."
The removal of the Federal Reserve will in turn
eliminate the Tax-exempt Complex, which is funding their political movement.
Smoot echoed this suggestion, writing,
"One sure and final way to stop this great
and growing evil," is to "eliminate the income-tax system which spawned
it." He added, "It is the people who must compel Congress to deny
administrative agencies of government the unconstitutional power of
granting tax-exemption. It is the people who must compel Congress to
submit a constitutional amendment calling for [a] repeal of the income
tax amendment."
Alan B. Jones stated,
"This change [to shut down the Federal
Reserve] is extremely important, and will strike at the root of the
elites' attack on our American society. Our free society is seen by them
as the only entity on earth still capable of growing strong enough
economically and socially to challenge their program for dominating the
earth."
Fortunately, there is an effort underway to
abolish the Federal Reserve, started by the late film producer Aaron Russo
at www.freedomtofascism.com.
I would consider his landmark documentary,
America: From Freedom to Fascism, critical for anyone who
wants to understand our situation, especially for targeted individuals who
wonder how this program could exist.
If you are a TI, I suggest you sign up for Aaron's movement (or a similar
one) to abolish the Federal Reserve. If you're part of the 9/11-truth
movement, remember that whitewashes such as the 9/11 Commission are possible
because congress is not in control.
Therefore, 9/11 truthers should consider joining
Aaron's movement. Once the Fed is removed, then congress can be persuaded to
stop the Hidden Evil and related agendas.
In their book, Access Denied: For Reasons of National Security, Cathy
O'Brien and Mark Phillips suggest repealing the 1947 National Security Act,
which is abundantly used as an excuse to target the civilian population, as
well as a pretext for a host of other crimes. I too believe this act should
be revoked because it's obvious to me that it is being used as an excuse for
the program, and to cover it up.
America must also be removed from the grip of the Council on Foreign
Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderbergers, and any other
supra-governmental agency that is promoting a worldwide government and a
reduction of individual civil liberties. This means public exposure of these
organizations. Smoot too recommends that we withdraw from all international,
governmental, or quasi-governmental organizations, including the World
Court, the United Nations, and UN specialized agencies.
Jones agreed, when he wrote,
"The best-known instruments of control which
they [the financial elite] are using are the United Nations, the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and... the NAFTA... GATT
and... World Trade Organization."
He suggested that we withdraw from these
organizations, and advised that the CFR should be recognized as a foreign
entity operating within the United States.
Other critical issues which are intimately related include the events
surrounding September 11th, and the Oklahoma City bombing. There must be a
complete investigation into these events by individuals with no connections
to the Establishment. Once again, I think the true power structure must be
restored before this can happen. 9/11 was a major historical event which
triggered drastic changes, and it is essential to find out what really
happened.
Therefore, whether you're targeted or not, I would advise anyone who wants
to learn what happened on 9/11 to visit 911truth.org, or
911sharethetruth.com. 9/11, the Oklahoma City bombing, the Hidden Evil, and
many other seemingly unconnected events are all part of a process.
Absent these things occurring, the best course of action is to raise
awareness. Raising awareness will mean various things to each individual.
Raising awareness is key because the one thing these people don't want is to
be cast into public light. Anything this evil must operate in secrecy.
"The evil hate the light," announced Dr.
Peck.
"The one thing these conspirators cannot
survive is exposure," stated Allen.
He continued,
"The Insiders are successful only because so
few of their victims know what is being planned." Allen explained that
they can operate only "in the dark," and "cannot stand the truthful
light of day."
Professor Marrs agreed,
"Having a light shined on their repugnant
activities causes these... arrogant and despicable men to desperately
scurry about seeking cover."
The mainstream media seems to be losing ground.
People are turning to blogs and truth radio such
as the Genesis Communications Network and the Republic Broadcasting Network.
A massive change is happening where people instinctively know there is a
major problem. The monopoly on the media does not have the same effect that
it could have thanks to the internet. The internet is one of their biggest
weaknesses.
They are aware of this, and it would not
surprise me if in the near future, they attempted to pass legislation which
prevents people from posting information that exposes their activities.
This legislation may be passed under the banner
of "anti-hate" or "anti-terror" speech.
People who are not yet targeted (or don't yet realize they are), must be
made aware that they are simply on the higher end of a sinking ship. Some of
those who participate in this program, which is contributing to the
enslavement of their children, may think that by participating they're
"insiders", and as long as they go along, they'll be okay. This is false.
They will be used and disposed of! Insiders are
not people with a million dollars or so, but people of tremendous wealth.
The only insiders are the financial elite.
"Unless you are an Insider, you are a
victim," wrote Allen.
He continued,
"To the Insiders, the world is their country
and their only loyalty is to themselves and their fellow conspirators...
Being an American means no more to them than being an honorary citizen
of Bali would mean to you. It has not bothered their consciences one
iota that millions of your fellow human beings have been murdered..."
Each person needs to decide how to best use
their personal gifts and resources.
For some it may be handing out flyers or
attending a rally. For others it means writing letters, posting information
on message boards, blogging, putting up a website, or writing an article.
But it also means educating yourself on this
program and what it's part of, so that however you choose to raise
awareness, you do so efficiently.
"The Job," described Allen, "is largely a
matter of getting others to realize that they have been conned and are
continuing to be conned. You must become the local arm of the word's
largest floating university. But before you can go to work, pointing out
these conspiratorial facts to others, you must know the facts yourself."
No doubt there are many informative
documentaries on the state of affairs.
I've only seen a small fraction of them since I
began to research this agenda in early 2005. But out of the ones I've seen,
some have been particularly fascinating.
They include,
-
9/11: The Great Illusion, by George
Humphrey
-
Martial Law 9/11: The Rise of the Police
State, by Alex Jones
-
America: From Freedom to Fascism, by
Aaron Russo (*2)
Any organization which recognizes that a
dictatorship is being setup is a potential ally.
This includes 9/11 truth groups and truth radio
talk shows.(*3) This also includes organizations which seek to restore the
constitution and abolish the Federal Reserve.
More than likely, some members of these
organizations are targeted but are unaware of it.
