During the 2004 presidential campaign,
George W. Bush
and John Kerry battled about whether Osama bin Laden had escaped from
Tora Bora in the final days of the war in Afghanistan. Bush, Kerry charged,
"didn't choose to use American forces to hunt down and kill" the leader of
Al Qaeda.
The president called his opponent's allegation
"the worst kind of Monday-morning quarterbacking." Bush asserted that U.S.
commanders on the ground did not know if bin Laden was at the mountain
hideaway along the Afghan border.
But in a forthcoming book, the CIA field commander for the agency's
Jawbreaker team at Tora Bora, Gary Berntsen, says he and other U.S.
commanders did know that bin Laden was among the hundreds of fleeing Qaeda
and Taliban members.
Berntsen says he had definitive intelligence
that bin Laden was holed up at Tora Bora - intelligence operatives had tracked
him - and could have been caught.
"He was there," Berntsen tells NEWSWEEK.
Asked to comment on Berntsen's remarks, National
Security Council spokesman Frederick Jones passed on 2004 statements from
former CENTCOM commander Gen. Tommy Franks.
"We don't know to this day whether Mr. bin
Laden was at Tora Bora in December 2001," Franks wrote in an Oct. 19 New
York Times op-ed. "Bin Laden was never within our grasp."
Berntsen says
Franks is "a great American. But he was not on the ground out there. I
was."
In his book - titled "Jawbreaker"
- the decorated
career CIA officer criticizes Donald Rumsfeld's Defense Department for not
providing enough support to the CIA and the Pentagon's own Special Forces
teams in the final hours of Tora Bora, says Berntsen's lawyer, Roy Krieger.
(Berntsen would not divulge the book's specifics, saying he's awaiting CIA
clearance.)
That backs up other recent accounts, including
that of military author Sean Naylor, who calls Tora Bora a "strategic
disaster" because the Pentagon refused to deploy a cordon of conventional
forces to cut off escaping Qaeda and Taliban members.
Maj. Todd Vician, a Defense Department
spokesman, says the problem at Tora Bora,
"was not necessarily just the number of
troops."
Berntsen's book gives, by contrast, a heroic
portrayal of CIA activities at Tora Bora and in the war on terror.
Ironically, he has sued the agency over what he calls unacceptable delays in
approving his book - a standard process for ex-agency employees describing
classified matters.
"They're just holding the book," which is
scheduled for October release, he says. "CIA officers, Special Forces
and U.S. air power drove the Taliban out in 70 days. The CIA has taken
roughly 80 days to clear my book."
Jennifer Millerwise, a CIA spokeswoman, says
Berntsen's,
"timeline is not accurate," adding that he submitted his book as
an ex-employee only in mid-June. "We take seriously our goal of responding
quickly."

Remember, this is just SIX MONTHS after 9/11. In response to a reporters
question, President Bush tells the world that he is "truly not that
concerned" with catching the man who murdered 3,000 Americans just six
months and two days earlier because "we've marginalized him."
Please note that he ALMOST says,
"I don't know where he is, nor do I...
(really care)." but catches himself in mid-sentence.
"He hides in caves while sending young people off to die."

The Getaway
Questions surround a Secret Pakistani Airlift
by Seymour M. Hersh
January 28, 2002
from
TheNewYorker Website
In Afghanistan last November, the Northern Alliance, supported by American
Special Forces troops and emboldened by the highly accurate American
bombing, forced thousands of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters to retreat inside
the northern hill town of Kunduz.
Trapped with them were Pakistani Army
officers, intelligence advisers, and volunteers who were fighting alongside
the Taliban. (Pakistan had been the Talibans staunchest military and
economic supporter in its long-running war against the Northern Alliance.)
Many of the fighters had fled earlier defeats at Mazar-i-Sharif, to the
west; Taloqan, to the east; and Pul-i-Khumri, to the south. The road to
Kabul, a potential point of retreat, was blocked and was targeted by
American bombers. Kunduz offered safety from the bombs and a chance to
negotiate painless surrender terms, as Afghan tribes often do.
Surrender negotiations began immediately, but the Bush Administration
heatedly - and successfully - opposed them. On November 25th, the Northern
Alliance took Kunduz, capturing some four thousand of the Taliban and Al
Qaeda fighters.
The next day, President Bush said,
Were smoking them out.
Theyre running, and now were going to bring them to justice.
Even before the siege ended, however, a puzzling series of reports appeared
in the Times and in other publications, quoting Northern Alliance officials
who claimed that Pakistani airplanes had flown into Kunduz to evacuate the
Pakistanis there. American and Pakistani officials refused to confirm the
reports.
On November 16th, when journalists asked Secretary of Defense
Donald Rumsfeld about the reports of rescue aircraft, he was dismissive.
Well, if we see them, we shoot them down, he said. Five days later, Rumsfeld declared, Any idea that those people should be let loose on any
basis at all to leave that country and to go bring terror to other countries
and destabilize other countries is unacceptable.
At a Pentagon news
conference on Monday, November 26th, the day after Kunduz fell, General
Richard B. Myers, of the Air Force, who is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, was asked about the reports.
The General did not directly answer
the question but stated,
The runway there is not usable. I mean, there are
segments of it that are usable. Theyre too short for your standard
transport aircraft. So were not sure where the reports are coming from.
Pakistani officials also debunked the rescue reports, and continued to
insist, as they had throughout the Afghanistan war, that no Pakistani
military personnel were in the country. Anwar Mehmood, the government
spokesman, told newsmen at the time that reports of a Pakistani airlift were
total rubbish. Hogwash.
In interviews, however, American intelligence officials and high-ranking
military officers said that Pakistanis were indeed flown to safety, in a
series of nighttime airlifts that were approved by the Bush Administration.
The Americans also said that what was supposed to be a limited evacuation
apparently slipped out of control, and, as an unintended consequence, an
unknown number of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters managed to join in the
exodus.
Dirt got through the screen, a senior intelligence official told
me.
Last week, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not respond to a request
for comment.
Pakistans leader, General Pervez Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999
coup, had risked his standing with the religious fundamentalists - and perhaps
his life - by endorsing the American attack on Afghanistan and the American
support of the Northern Alliance. At the time of Kunduz, his decision looked
like an especially dangerous one.
The initial American aim in Afghanistan
had been not to eliminate the Talibans presence there entirely but to
undermine the regime and Al Qaeda while leaving intact so-called moderate
Taliban elements that would play a role in a new postwar government. This
would insure that Pakistan would not end up with a regime on its border
dominated by the Northern Alliance. By mid-November, it was clear that the
Northern Alliance would quickly sweep through Afghanistan.
There were fears
that once the Northern Alliance took Kunduz, there would be wholesale
killings of the defeated fighters, especially the foreigners.
Musharraf won American support for the airlift by warning that the
humiliation of losing hundreds - and perhaps thousands - of Pakistani Army men
and intelligence operatives would jeopardize his political survival.
Clearly, there is a great willingness to help Musharraf, an American
intelligence official told me.
A CIA analyst said that it was his
understanding that the decision to permit the airlift was made by the White
House and was indeed driven by a desire to protect the Pakistani leader.
The
airlift made sense at the time, the CIA analyst said.
Many of the
people they spirited away were the Taliban leadership - who Pakistan hoped
could play a role in a postwar Afghan government.
According to this person,
Musharraf wanted to have these people to put another card on the table in
future political negotiations.
We were supposed to have access to them, he
said, but it didnt happen, and the rescued Taliban remain unavailable to
American intelligence.
According to a former high-level American defense official, the airlift was
approved because of representations by the Pakistanis that,
there were guys -
intelligence agents and underground guys - who needed to get out.
Once under way, a senior American defense adviser said, the airlift became
chaotic.
Everyone brought their friends with them, he said, referring to
the Afghans with whom the Pakistanis had worked, and whom they had trained
or had used to run intelligence operations. Youre not going to leave them
behind to get their throats cut.
Recalling the last-minute American
evacuation at the end of the Vietnam War, in 1975, the adviser added,
When
we came out of Saigon, we brought our boys with us.
He meant South
Vietnamese nationals.
How many does that helicopter hold? Ten? Were
bringing fourteen.
The
Bush Administration may have done more than simply acquiesce in the
rescue effort: at the height of the standoff, according to both a CIA
official and a military analyst who has worked with the Delta Force, the
American commando unit that was destroying Taliban units on the ground, the
Administration ordered the United States Central Command to set up a special
air corridor to help insure the safety of the Pakistani rescue flights from Kunduz to the northwest corner of Pakistan, about two hundred miles away.
The order left some members of the Delta Force deeply frustrated.
These
guys did Desert Storm and Mogadishu, the military analyst said. They see
things in black-and-white. Unhappy is not the word. Theyre supposed to be
killing people.
The airlift also angered the Northern Alliance, whose
leadership, according to Reuel Gerecht, a former Near East operative for the
CIA, had sought unsuccessfully for years to get people to pay attention
to the Pakistani element among the Taliban.
The Northern Alliance was eager
to capture mainline Pakistani military and intelligence officers at Kunduz,
Gerecht said.
When the rescue flights started, it touched a raw nerve.
Just as Pakistan has supported the Taliban in Afghanistan, Pakistans
arch-rival India has supported the Northern Alliance. Operatives in Indias
main external intelligence unit - known as RAW, for Research and Analysis
Wing - reported extensively on the Pakistani airlift out of Kunduz. (The
Taliban and Al Qaeda have declared the elimination of Indias presence in
the contested territory of Kashmir as a major goal.)
RAW has excellent
access to the Northern Alliance and a highly sophisticated ability to
intercept electronic communications. An Indian military adviser boasted that
when the airlift began we knew within minutes.
In interviews in New Delhi,
Indian national-security and intelligence officials repeatedly declared that
the airlift had rescued not only members of the Pakistani military but
Pakistani citizens who had volunteered to fight against the Northern
Alliance, as well as non-Pakistani Taliban and Al Qaeda.
Brajesh Mishra,
Indias national-security adviser, said his government had concluded that
five thousand Pakistanis and Taliban - he called it a ballpark figure - had
been rescued.
According to RAWs senior analyst for Pakistani and Afghan issues, the most
extensive rescue efforts took place on three nights at the time of the fall
of Kunduz.
Indian intelligence had concluded that eight thousand or more men
were trapped inside the city in the last days of the siege, roughly half of
whom were Pakistanis. (Afghans, Uzbeks, Chechens, and various Arab
mercenaries accounted for the rest.) At least five flights were specifically
confirmed by Indias informants, the RAW analyst told me, and many more
were believed to have taken place.
In the Indian assessment, thirty-three hundred prisoners surrendered to a
Northern Alliance tribal faction headed by General Abdul Rashid Dostum. A
few hundred Taliban were also turned over to other tribal leaders.
That left
between four and five thousand men unaccounted for.
Where are the balance?
the intelligence officer asked.
According to him, two Pakistani Army
generals were on the flights.
None of the American intelligence officials I spoke with were able to say
with certainty how many Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters were flown to safety,
or may have escaped from Kunduz by other means.
India, wary of antagonizing the Bush Administration, chose not to denounce
the airlift at the time.
But there was a great deal of anger within the
Indian government.
We had all the information, but we did not go public,
the Indian military adviser told me. Why should we embarrass you? We should
be sensible.
A RAW official said that India had intelligence that Musharrafs message to the Americans had been that he didnt want to see
body bags coming back to Pakistan. Brajesh Mishra told me that diplomatic
notes protesting the airlift were sent to Britain and the United States.
Neither responded, he said.
Mishra also said that Indian intelligence was convinced that many of the
airlifted fighters would soon be infiltrated into Kashmir. There was a
precedent for this. In the past, the Pakistani Armys Inter-Services
Intelligence agency (I.S.I.) had trained fighters in Afghanistan and then
funnelled them into Kashmir.
One of Indias most senior intelligence
officials also told me,
Musharraf cant afford to keep the Taliban in
Pakistan. Theyre dangerous to his own regime. Our reading is that the
fighters can go only to Kashmir.
Kashmir, on Indias northern border, is a predominantly Muslim territory
that has been fiercely disputed since Partition, in 1947.
Both India and
Pakistan have waged war to support their claim. Pakistanis believe that
Kashmir should have become part of their country in the first place, and
that India reneged on the promise of a plebiscite to determine its future.
India argues that a claim to the territory on religious grounds is a threat
to Indias status as a secular, multi-ethnic nation. Kashmir is now divided
along a carefully drawn line of control, but cross-border incursions - many of
them bloody - occur daily.
Three weeks after the airlift, on December 13th, a suicide squad of five
heavily armed Muslim terrorists drove past a barrier at the Indian
Parliament, in New Delhi, and rushed the main building.
At one point, the
terrorists were only a few feet from the steps to the office of Indias
Vice-President, Krishan Kant. Nine people were killed in the shoot-out, in
addition to the terrorists, and many others were injured. The countrys
politicians and the press felt that a far greater tragedy had only narrowly
been averted.
In India, the Parliament assault was regarded as comparable to September
11th. Indian intelligence quickly concluded that the attack had been
organized by operatives from two long-standing Kashmiri terrorist
organizations that were believed to be heavily supported by the I.S.I.
Brajesh Mishra told me that if the attack on the Parliament had resulted in
a more significant number of casualties there would have been mayhem.
India deployed hundreds of thousands of troops along its border with
Pakistan, and publicly demanded that Musharraf take steps to cut off
Pakistani support for the groups said to be involved.
Nobody in India wants
war, but other options are not ruled out, Mishra said.
The crisis escalated, with military men on both sides declaring that they
were prepared to face nuclear war, if necessary. Last week, Colin Powell,
the Secretary of State, traveled to the region and urged both sides to
withdraw their troops, cool the rhetoric, and begin constructive talks about
Kashmir.
Under prodding from the Bush Administration, Musharraf has taken action
against his countrys fundamentalist terror organizations. In the last
month, the government has made more than a thousand arrests, seized bank
accounts, and ordered the I.S.I. to stop all support for terrorist groups
operating inside Kashmir.
In a televised address to the nation on January
12th, Musharraf called for an end to terrorism, but he also went beyond the
most recent dispute with India and outlined a far-reaching vision of
Pakistan as a modern state.
The day of reckoning has come, he said. Do we
want Pakistan to become a theocratic state? Do we believe that religious
education alone is enough for governance? Or do we want Pakistan to emerge
as a progressive and dynamic Islamic welfare state?
The fundamentalists, he
added,
did nothing except contribute to bloodshed in Afghanistan. I ask of
them whether they know anything other than disruption and sowing seeds of
hatred. Does Islam preach this?
Musharraf has not done as much as the Indians want, a Bush Administration
official who is deeply involved in South Asian issues said. But hes done
more than Id thought hed do. He had to do something, because the Indians
are so wound up.
The official also said, however, that Musharraf could not
last in office if he conceded the issue of Kashmir to India, and would not
want to do so in any case.
He is not a fundamentalist but a Pakistani
nationalist - he genuinely believes that Kashmir should be ours. At the end
of the day, Musharraf would come out ahead if he could get rid of the
Pakistani and Kashmiri terrorists - if he can survive it. They have eaten the
vitals out of Pakistan.
In his address, Musharraf was unyielding on that
subject.
Kashmir runs in our blood, he said. No Pakistani can afford to
sever links with Kashmir. . . . We will never budge an inch from our
principled stand on Kashmir.
Milton Bearden, a former CIA station chief in Pakistan who helped run the
Afghan war against the Soviet Union in the late nineteen-eighties and worked
closely with the I.S.I., believes that the Indian government is cynically
using the Parliament bombing to rally public support for the conflict with
Pakistan.
The Indians are just playing brinkmanship now
- moving troops up to
the border, he said. Until September 11th, they thought theyd won this
thing - they had Pakistan on the ropes.
Because of its nuclear program, he
said,
Pakistan was isolated and sanctioned by the United States, with only
China left as an ally. Never mind that the only country in South Asia that
always did what we asked was Pakistan.
As for Musharraf, Bearden said,
What can he do? Does he really have the Army behind him? Yes, but maybe by
only forty-eight to fifty-two per cent.
Bearden went on,
Musharraf is not
going to be a Kemal Atatürk - the founder of the secular Turkish state - but
as long as he can look over his shoulder and see that Rich Armitage - the
United States Deputy Secretary of State - and Don Rumsfeld are with him he
might be able to stop the extremism.
A senior Pakistani diplomat depicted India as suffering from jilted-lover
syndrome - referring to the enormous amount of American attention and
financial aid that the Musharraf government has received since September
11th.
The situation is bloody explosive, the diplomat said, and argued
that Musharraf has not been given enough credit from the Indian leadership
for the sweeping changes that have taken place in Pakistan.
Short of
saying it is now a secular Pakistan, hes redefined and changed the politics
of the regime, the diplomat said. He has de-legitimized religious
fundamentalism.
The diplomat told me that the critical question for
Pakistan, India, and the rest of South Asia is,
Will the Americans stay
involved for the long haul, or will attention shift to Somalia or Iraq? I
dont know.
Inevitably, any conversation about tension between India and Pakistan turns
to the issue of nuclear weapons.
Both countries have warheads and the means
to deliver them. (Indias capabilities, conventional and nuclear, are far
greater - between sixty and ninety warheads - while Pakistan is thought to have
between thirty and fifty.)
A retired CIA officer who served as station
chief in South Asia told me that what he found disturbing was the imperfect
intelligence each country has as to what the other sides intentions are.
Couple that with the fact that these guys have a propensity to believe the
worst of each other, and have nuclear weapons, and you end up saying, My
God, get me the hell out of here.
Milton Bearden agreed that the I.S.I.
and RAW are equally bad at assessing each other.
In New Delhi, I got a sense of how dangerous the situation is, in a
conversation with an Indian diplomat who has worked at the highest levels of
his countrys government. He told me that he believes India could begin a
war with Pakistan and not face a possible nuclear retaliation.
He explained,
When Pakistan went nuclear, we called their bluff.
He was referring to a
tense moment in 1990, when India moved its Army en masse along the Pakistani
border and then sat back while the United States mediated a withdrawal.
We
found, through intelligence, that there was a lot of bluster.
He and others
in India concluded that Pakistan was not willing to begin a nuclear
confrontation.
Weve found there is a lot of strategic space between a
low-intensity war waged with Pakistan and the nuclear threshold, the
diplomat said. Therefore, we are utilizing military options without
worrying about the nuclear threshold.
If that turned out to be a
miscalculation and Pakistan initiated the use of nuclear weapons, he said,
then India would respond in force.
And Pakistan would cease to exist.
The
Bush Administration official involved in South Asian issues acknowledged
that there are some people in India who seem willing to gamble that,
you can
have war but not use nuclear weapons. He added, Both nations need to sit
down and work out the red lines - the points of no return. Theyve never
done that.
An American intelligence official told me that the Musharraf regime had
added to the precariousness of the military standoff with India by reducing
the amount of time it would take for Pakistan to execute a nuclear strike.
Pakistan keeps control over its nuclear arsenal in part by storing its
warheads separately from its missile- and aircraft-delivery systems.
In
recent weeks, he said, the time it takes to get the warheads in the air has
been cut to just three hours,
and thats too close. Both sides have their
nukes in place and ready to roll.
Even before the airlift from Kunduz, the Indians were enraged by the Bush
Administrations decision to make Pakistan its chief ally in the Afghanistan
war.
Musharraf has two-timed you, a recently retired senior member of
Indias diplomatic service told me in New Delhi earlier this month. What
have you gained? Have you captured Osama bin Laden?
He said that although
India would do nothing to upset the American campaign in Afghanistan,
We
will turn the heat on Musharraf. Hell go back to terrorism as long as the
heat is off.
(Milton Bearden scoffed at that characterization.
"Musharraf
doesnt have time to two-time anybody, he said. He wakes up every morning
and has to head out with his bayonet, trying to find the land mines.")
Some CIA analysts believe that bin Laden eluded American capture inside
Afghanistan with help from elements of the Pakistani intelligence service.
The game against bin Laden is not over, one analyst told me in early
January. He speculated that bin Laden could be on his way to Somalia, his
best single place to hide.
Al Qaeda is known to have an extensive
infrastructure there.
The analyst said that he had concluded that,
hes out.
Weve been looking for bombing targets for weeks and weeks there but cant
identify them.
Last week, Donald Rumsfeld told journalists that he believed bin Laden was
still in Afghanistan. Two days later, in Pakistan, Musharraf announced that
he thought bin Laden was probably dead - of kidney disease.
A senior CIA official, when asked for comment, cautioned that there were
a variety of competing assessments inside the agency as to bin Ladens
whereabouts.
We really dont know, he said. Well get him, but anybody
who tells you we know where he is is full of it.
Indias grievances - over the Pakistani airlift, the continuing terrorism in
Kashmir, and Musharrafs new status with Washington - however heartfelt, may
mean little when it comes to effecting a dramatic change of American policy
in South Asia. Indias democracy and its tradition of civilian control over
the military make it less of a foreign-policy priority than Pakistan.
The
Bush Administration has put its prestige, and American aid money, behind Musharraf, in the gamble
- thus far successful - that he will continue to move
Pakistan, and its nuclear arsenal, away from fundamentalism. The goal is to
stop nuclear terrorism as well as political terrorism. Its a tall order,
and missteps are inevitable. Nonetheless, the White House remains
optimistic.
An Administration official told me that, given the complications
of todays politics, he still believed that Musharraf was the best Pakistani
leader the Indians could hope for, whether they recognize it or not.
After
him, they could only get something worse.
