Wars are expensive.
The recruitment and sustainment of
fighters in the field, the ongoing
purchases of weapons and munitions,
as well as the myriad other costs of
struggle, add up.
So why isn't the
United States going after Islamic
State's funding sources as a way of
lessening or eliminating their
strength at making war? Follow the
money back, cut it off, and you
strike a blow much more devastating
than an airstrike.
But that has not
happened. Why?
Donations
Many have long held
that Sunni terror groups, ISIS now
and al Qaeda before them, are funded
via Gulf States, such as Saudi
Arabia, who are also long-time
American allies.
Direct links are
difficult to prove, particularly if
the United States chooses not to
prove them.
The issue is exacerbated
by suggestions that the money comes
from "donors," not directly from
national treasuries, and may be
routed through legitimate charitable
organizations or front companies.
In fact, one person
concerned about Saudi funding
was then Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton, who warned in a
2009 message on Wikileaks that
donors in Saudi Arabia were the,
"most significant
source of funding to Sunni
terrorist groups worldwide."
At the G20, Russian
President Vladimir Putin said out
loud what has otherwise not been
publicly discussed much in public.
He announced that he
has shared intelligence with the
other G20 member states which
reveals
40 countries from which ISIS
finances the majority of its
terrorist activities.
The list reportedly
included a number of G20 countries.
Putin's list of funders has not
been made public.
The G20, however,
include,
-
Argentina
-
Australia

Brazil

Canada

China

Oil
One source of income
for ISIS is and has robustly been
oil sales.

man refines oil to produce gas and
diesel.
A
micro-industry for fuel refinement
has grown up around the desert town
of
Al Mansura east of Al Raqqah, the
capital of ISIS.
Small stills burn oil that is
trucked in by the barrel load from
the oil fields of Al Hasakah.
Each still can process about a
thousand liters of crude a day
into gas and diesel.

In the early days of
the air campaign, American officials
made a point to say that the Islamic
State's oil drilling assets were
high on the target list. Yet few
sites have actually been targeted.
A Pentagon
spokesperson
explained that the coalition has
actually been trying to spare some
of ISIS's largest oil producing
facilities,
"recognizing that they
remain the property of the Syrian
people," and to limit collateral
damage to civilians nearby.
The U.S. only this
week began a slightly more
aggressive approach toward the oil,
albeit bombing tanker trucks, not
the infrastructure behind them. The
trucks were destroyed at the Abu
Kamal oil collection point, near the
Iraqi border.
Conservative
estimates are that Islamic State
takes in one to two million dollars
a day from oil sales; some see the
number as high as four million a
day.
As recently as
February, however, the Pentagon
claimed oil was no longer ISIS'
main way to raise money, having been
bypassed by those "donations" from
unspecified sources, and smuggling.
Turkey
One of the issues
with selling oil, by anyone,
including ISIS, is bringing the
stuff to market.
Oil must be taken
from the ground using heavy
equipment, possibly refined, stored,
loaded into trucks or pipelines,
moved somewhere and then sold into
the worldwide market. Large amounts
of money must be exchanged, and one
to four million dollars a day is a
lot of cash to deal with on a daily
basis.
It may be that some
sort of electronic transactions that
have somehow to date eluded the
United States are involved.
Interestingly,
The Guardian
reported a U.S.-led raid on the
compound housing the Islamic State's
chief financial officer produced
evidence that Turkish officials
directly dealt with ranking ISIS
members, including the ISIS officer
responsible for directing the terror
army's oil and gas operations in
Syria.
Turkey's "open
door policy," in which it
allowed its southern border to
serve as an unofficial transit point
in and out of Syria, has been said
to be one of ISIS' main routes for
getting their oil to market.
A Turkish apologist
claimed the oil is moved only
via small-diameter plastic
irrigation pipes, and is thus hard
to monitor.
A smuggled barrel of
oil is sold for about $50 on the
black market. This means "several
million dollars" a day worth of
oil would require a very large
number of very small pipes.
Others
believe Turkish and Iraqi oil
buyers travel into Syria with their
own trucks, and purchase the ISIS
oil right at the refineries,
transporting themselves out of
Syria. Convoys of trucks are easy to
spot from the air, and easy to
destroy from the air, though up
until now the U.S. does not seem to
have done so.
So as is said, ISIS' sources of
funding grow curious and curiouser
the more one knows.
Those seeking to
destroy ISIS might well wish to look
into where the money comes from, and
ask why, after a year and three
months of war, no one has bothered
to follow the money.
And cut it off...
