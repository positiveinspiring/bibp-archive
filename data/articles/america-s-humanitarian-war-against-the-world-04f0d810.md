is a point by point thematic summary
of Prof. Michel Chossudovsky's presentation
at the Science for Peace Conference,
Academy of Sciences, Malaysia.
Kuala Lumpur
15-16 August 2016
Introduction Historically, science has supported the development of the weapons industry and the war economy.
"Science for Peace" indelibly requires reversing the logic whereby commissioned scientific endeavors are directed towards supporting what President Eisenhower called "The Military Industrial Complex". What is consequently required is a massive redirection of science and technology towards the pursuit of broad societal objectives.
In turn, this requires a major shift in what is euphemistically called "U.S. Foreign Policy", namely America's global military agenda.
Military Affairs - The Current Global Context The world is at a dangerous crossroads. The United States and its allies have launched a military adventure which threatens the future of humanity. Under a global military agenda, the actions undertaken by the Western military alliance (U.S.-NATO-Israel) in,
Afghanistan Libya Yemen Pakistan Palestine Ukraine Syria Iraq,
Afghanistan
Libya
Yemen
Pakistan
Palestine
Ukraine
Syria
Iraq,
...are coordinated at the highest levels of the military hierarchy.
We are not dealing with piecemeal military and intelligence operations.
Major military and covert intelligence operations are being undertaken simultaneously in the,
Middle East Eastern Europe sub-Saharan Africa Central Asia the Asia Pacific region
Middle East
Eastern Europe
sub-Saharan Africa
Central Asia
the Asia Pacific region
The current situation is all the more critical inasmuch as a U.S.-NATO war on Russia, China and Iran is part of the U.S. presidential election debate. It is presented as a political and military option to Western public opinion. The U.S.-NATO military agenda combines both major theater operations as well as covert actions geared towards destabilizing sovereign states.
America's hegemonic project is to destabilize and destroy countries through,
acts of war support of terrorist organizations regime change economic warfare
acts of war
support of terrorist organizations
regime change
economic warfare
U.S. and NATO forces have been deployed in Eastern Europe including Poland and Ukraine.
In turn, military maneuvers are being conducted at Russia's doorstep which could potentially lead to confrontation with the Russian Federation. The U.S. and its allies are also threatening China under President Obama's "Pivot to Asia". The U.S. led airstrikes initiated in August 2014 directed against Iraq and Syria under the pretext of going after the Islamic State are part of a scenario of military escalation extending from North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean to Central and South Asia.
THE HISTORY OF NUCLEAR WAR AND "COLLATERAL DAMAGE" "We have discovered the most terrible bomb in the history of the world. It may be the fire destruction prophesied in the Euphrates Valley Era, after Noah and his fabulous Ark This weapon is to be used against Japan [We] will use it so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children. Even if the Japs are savages, ruthless, merciless and fanatic, we as the leader of the world for the common welfare cannot drop that terrible bomb on the old capital or the new. The target will be a purely military one It seems to be the most terrible thing ever discovered, but it can be made the most useful." (President Harry S. Truman, Diary, July 25, 1945) "The World will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima a military base. That was because we wished in this first attack to avoid, insofar as possible, the killing of civilians." (President Harry S. Truman in a radio speech to the Nation, August 9, 1945). [Note: the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945; the Second on Nagasaki, on August 9, on the same day as Truman's radio speech to the Nation] for Video click above image Is Truman's notion of "collateral damage" in the case of nuclear war still relevant? Publicly available military documents confirm that nuclear war is still on the drawing board of the Pentagon. Compared to the 1950s, however, today's nuclear weapons are far more advanced. The delivery system is more precise. In addition to China and Russia, Iran and North Korea are targets for a first strike pre-emptive nuclear attack. U.S. military documents claim that the new generation of tactical nuclear weapons are harmless to civilians. Let us be under no illusions, the Pentagon's plan to blow up the planet using advanced nuclear weapons is still on the books. Hiroshima after the bomb

Global Warfare The U.S. has formulated a global war scenario, which is defined in military documents. There are three major regional deployments of U.S.-NATO which threaten Global Security:
Eastern Europe on Russia's Western Frontier, with the deployment of U.S.-NATO military hardware on Russia's doorstep "The Pivot to Asia" largely directed against China The Middle East and North Africa, extending to Central Asia
Eastern Europe on Russia's Western Frontier, with the deployment of U.S.-NATO military hardware on Russia's doorstep
"The Pivot to Asia" largely directed against China
The Middle East and North Africa, extending to Central Asia
In the above regions, the use of nuclear weapons on a preemptive basis is contemplated against both nuclear and non-nuclear states. In other regions of the World including Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, non-conventional forms of warfare are envisaged including,
destabilization "regime change" covert support to terrorist organizations economic warfare

The Global War on Terrorism is a Big Lie - Al Qaeda is a Creation of U.S. Intelligence From the outset of the Soviet-Afghan war in 1979 to the present, various Islamic fundamentalist paramilitary organizations became de facto instruments of U.S. intelligence and more generally of the U.S.-NATO-Israel military alliance. The U.S. has actively supported Al Qaeda affiliated terrorist organizations since the onslaught of the Soviet Afghan War.
Washington has engineered the installation of Islamist regimes in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It has destroyed the fabric of secular societies. Confirmed by Israeli intelligence media, the Al Qaeda opposition fighters in Syria are recruited by U.S.-NATO and the Turkish high command. They are the foot-soldiers of the Western military alliance, with special forces in their midst.
The Al Qaeda affiliated "moderate" terrorist organizations in Syria are supported by Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The counter-terrorism agenda is bogus. It's a criminal undertaking.
What is being bombed is the civilian infrastructure of a sovereign country.
The Historical Origins of al Qaeda
In this above video-footage President Carter's National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski (1979) arrives in a helicopter and speaks to a translator in front of a seated crowd of Mujahedeen:
'We know of their deep belief in god - that they're confident that their struggle will succeed. That land over-there is yours - and you'll go back to it some day, because your fight will prevail, and you'll have your homes, your mosques, back again, because your cause is right, and god is on your side.'
'We know of their deep belief in god - that they're confident that their struggle will succeed.
That land over-there is yours - and you'll go back to it some day, because your fight will prevail, and you'll have your homes, your mosques, back again, because your cause is right, and god is on your side.'

The Central Intelligence Agency using Pakistan's ISI as a go-between played a key role in training the Mujahideen. In turn, the CIA-sponsored guerrilla training was integrated with the teachings of Islam.
The madrasahs were set up by Wahabi fundamentalists financed out of Saudi Arabia:

Destroying National Sovereignty and Secular Societies, Installing an Islamic State (Made in America) What has been the fate of Afghanistan. A progressive secular state in the 1970s and early 1980s has become a U.S. failed State integrated by U.S. supported Al Qaeda terrorists. This is the model that U.S.-NATO want to impose on Syria, Iraq, Libya:
Destroy national sovereignty and replace it with an Islamic State which conforms to Washington's demands.
Kabul University in the 1980′s
Unknown to the American public, the U.S. spread the teachings of the Islamic jihad in textbooks "Made in America", developed at the University of Nebraska:
the United States spent millions of dollars to supply Afghan schoolchildren with textbooks filled with violent images and militant Islamic teachings, part of covert attempts to spur resistance to the Soviet occupation.The primers, which were filled with talk of jihad and featured drawings of guns, bullets, soldiers and mines, have served since then as the Afghan school system's core curriculum. Even the Taliban used the American-produced books...The White House defends the religious content, saying that Islamic principles permeate Afghan culture and that the books, "are fully in compliance with U.S. law and policy." Legal experts, however, question whether the books violate a constitutional ban on using tax dollars to promote religion. AID officials said in interviews that they left the Islamic materials intact because they feared Afghan educators would reject books lacking a strong dose of Muslim thought. The agency removed its logo and any mention of the U.S. government from the religious texts, AID spokeswoman Kathryn Stratos said. "It's not AID's policy to support religious instruction," Stratos said. "But we went ahead with this project because the primary purpose... is to educate children, which is predominantly a secular activity." Published in the dominant Afghan languages of Dari and Pashtun, the textbooks were developed in the early 1980s under an AID grant to the University of Nebraska-Omaha and its Center for Afghanistan Studies. The agency spent $ 51 million on the university's education programs in Afghanistan from 1984 to 1994." (Washington Post, 23 March 2002)

Concluding Remarks War is not an inevitable process. War can be prevented through mass action. War criminals occupy positions of authority. The citizenry is galvanized into supporting the rulers, who are "committed to their safety and well-being". Through media disinformation, war is given a humanitarian mandate. The legitimacy of the war must be addressed. Antiwar sentiment alone does not disarm a military agenda. The corporate backers and sponsors of war and war crimes must also be targeted including the oil companies, the defense contractors, the financial institutions and the corporate media, which has become an integral part of the war propaganda machine. There is a sense of urgency.
Today, the antiwar movement is virtually defunct.
What is the Truth The real threat to global security emanates from the U.S.-NATO-Israel alliance, yet realities in an inquisitorial environment are turned upside down:
the warmongers are committed to peace, the victims of war are presented as the protagonists of war.
The homeland is threatened. The media, intellectuals and the politicians, in chorus, obfuscate the unspoken truth, namely that the U.S.-NATO led war destroys humanity. When the lie becomes the truth there is no turning backwards. When war is upheld as a humanitarian endeavor, justice and the entire international legal system are turned upside down:
pacifism and the antiwar movement are criminalized.
Opposing the war becomes a criminal act.
Meanwhile, the war criminals in high office have ordered a witch hunt against those who challenge their authority. The Big Lie must be exposed for what it is and what it does.
It sanctions the indiscriminate killing of men, women and children. It destroys families and people. It destroys the commitment of people towards their fellow human beings.It prevents people from expressing their solidarity for those who suffer. It upholds war and the police state as the sole avenue. It destroys both nationalism and internationalism.
Breaking the lie means breaking a criminal project of global destruction, in which the quest for profit is the overriding force.
Actions
The role of media disinformation in sustaining the military agenda is crucial.We will not succeed in our endeavors unless the propaganda apparatus is weakened and eventually dismantled. It is essential to inform our fellow citizens on the causes and consequences of the U.S.-led war, not to mention the extensive war crimes and atrocities which are routinely obfuscated by the media. This is no easy task. It requires an effective counter-propaganda program which refutes mainstream media assertions.It is essential that the relevant information and analysis reaches the broader public. The Western media is controlled by a handful of powerful business syndicates. The media conglomerates which control network TV and the printed press must be challenged through cohesive actions which reveal the lies and falsehoods. There is opposition within the political establishment in the U.S. as well as within the ranks of the Armed Forces.While this opposition does not necessarily question the overall direction of U.S. foreign policy, it is firmly opposed to military adventurism, including the use of nuclear weapons. These voices within the institutions of the State, the Military and the business establishment are important because they can be usefully channeled to discredit and ultimately dismantle the "war on terrorism" consensus. The broadest possible alliance of political and social forces is, therefore, required to prevent a military adventure which in a very real sense threatens the future of humanity. The structure of military alliances must be addressed. A timely shift in military alliances could potentially reverse the course of history.Whereas France and Germany are broadly supportive of the U.S. led war, there are strong voices in both countries as well as within the European Union, which firmly oppose the U.S. led military agenda, both at the grassroots level as well within the political system itself. The weakening of the system of alliances which commits Western Europe to supporting the Anglo-American military axis, could indeed contribute to reversing the tide. Washington would hesitate to wage a war on Iran without the support of France and Germany. The holding of large antiwar rallies is important and essential. But in will not in itself reverse the tide of war unless it is accompanied by the development of a cohesive antiwar network.

The holding of large antiwar rallies is important and essential. But in will not in itself reverse the tide of war unless it is accompanied by the development of a cohesive antiwar network.
What is required is a grass roots antiwar network, a mass movement at national and international levels, which challenges the legitimacy of the main military and political actors, as well as their corporate sponsors, and which would ultimately be instrumental in unseating those who rule in 'our name'.
The construction of this type of network will take time to develop.
Initially, it should focus on developing an antiwar stance within existing citizens' organizations (e.g. trade unions, community organizations, professional regroupings, student federations, municipal councils, etc.) Close down the weapons factories and the military bases. Bring home the troops. Members of the armed forces should disobey orders and refuse to participate in a criminal war.
