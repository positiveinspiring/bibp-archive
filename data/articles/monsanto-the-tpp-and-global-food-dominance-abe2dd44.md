"Control oil
and you control nations,"
said US Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger in the 1970s.
"Control
food and you control
the people."
Global food control has nearly been achieved, by
reducing seed diversity with GMO (genetically modified) seeds that are
distributed by only a few transnational corporations.
But this agenda has
been implemented at grave cost to our health; and if the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP) passes, control over not just our food but our health, our
environment and our financial system will be in the hands of transnational
corporations.
Profits Before Populations
According to an
Acres USA interview
of plant pathologist Don Huber, Professor Emeritus at Purdue University, two
modified traits account for practically all of the genetically modified
crops grown in the world today.
One involves insect resistance. The other,
more disturbing modification involves insensitivity to glyphosate-based
herbicides (plant-killing chemicals). Often known as Roundup after the
best-selling Monsanto product of that name, glyphosate poisons everything in
its path except plants genetically modified to resist it.
Glyphosate-based herbicides are now the most
commonly used herbicides in the world.
Glyphosate is an essential partner to
the GMOs that are the principal business of the burgeoning biotech industry.
Glyphosate is a "broad-spectrum" herbicide that destroys indiscriminately,
not by killing unwanted plants directly but by tying up access to critical
nutrients.
Because of the insidious way in which it works,
it has been sold as a relatively benign replacement for the devastating
earlier dioxin-based herbicides. But a barrage of experimental data has now
shown glyphosate and
the GMO foods incorporating it to pose serious dangers
to health.
Compounding the risk is the toxicity of "inert" ingredients used
to make glyphosate more potent.
Researchers have found, for example, that the
surfactant POEA can kill human cells, particularly embryonic,
placental and umbilical cord cells. But these risks have been conveniently
ignored.
The widespread use of GMO foods and glyphosate
herbicides helps explain the anomaly that the US spends over
twice as much per capita on healthcare as the average developed
country, yet it is rated far down the scale of the worlds healthiest
populations.
The World Health Organization
has ranked the US LAST out of 17 developed
nations for overall health.
Sixty to seventy percent
of the foods in US supermarkets
are now genetically modified.
By contrast, in at least 26 other
countries, including,
-
Switzerland
-
Australia
-
Austria
-
China
-
India
-
France
-
Germany
-
Hungary
-
Luxembourg
-
Greece
-
Bulgaria
-
Poland
-
Italy
-
Mexico
-
Russia,
...GMOs
are totally or partially banned; and significant restrictions on GMOs
exist in about sixty other countries.
A ban on GMO and glyphosate use might go far
toward improving the health of Americans.
But the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
a global trade agreement for which the Obama Administration has sought Fast
Track status, would block that sort of cause-focused approach to the
healthcare crisis.
Roundups Insidious Effects
Roundup-resistant crops escape being killed by
glyphosate, but they do not avoid absorbing it into their tissues.
Herbicide-tolerant crops have substantially higher levels of herbicide
residues than other crops. In fact, many countries have had to increase
their legally allowable levels - by up to 50 times - in order to accommodate the
introduction of GM crops.
In the European Union,
residues in foods are set to
rise 100-150 times if a new proposal by
Monsanto is approved. Meanwhile, herbicide-tolerant "super-weeds" have
adapted to the chemical, requiring
even more toxic doses and new toxic chemicals to kill the plant.
Human enzymes are affected by glyphosate just as
plant enzymes are: the chemical blocks the uptake of manganese and other
essential minerals.
Without those minerals, we cannot properly metabolize
our food. That helps explain the rampant epidemic of obesity in the United
States. People eat and eat in an attempt to acquire the nutrients that are
simply not available in their food.
According to researchers
Samsell and Seneff
in
Biosemiotic Entropy - Disorder, Disease, and Mortality (April 2013):
Glyphosates inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP)
enzymes is an overlooked component of its toxicity to mammals. CYP enzymes
play crucial roles in biology...
Negative impact on the body is
insidious and manifests slowly over time as inflammation damages cellular
systems throughout the body.
Consequences are most of the diseases and
conditions associated with a Western diet, which include gastrointestinal
disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, autism,
infertility, cancer and Alzheimers disease.
More than 40 diseases have been linked to
glyphosate use, and more keep appearing.
In September 2013,
the National University of Rio Cuarto, Argentina,
published research
finding that glyphosate enhances the growth of fungi that produce aflatoxin
B1, one of the most carcinogenic of substances.
A doctor from Chaco,
Argentina, told Associated Press,
"Weve gone from a pretty healthy population
to one with a high rate of cancer, birth defects and illnesses seldom
seen before."
Fungi growths have increased significantly in US corn
crops.
Glyphosate has also done serious damage to the
environment.
According to an
October 2012 report by the Institute of
Science in Society:
Agribusiness claims that glyphosate and
glyphosate-tolerant crops will improve crop yields, increase farmers
profits and benefit the environment by reducing pesticide use.
Exactly
the opposite is the case...
[T]he evidence indicates that glyphosate
herbicides and glyphosate-tolerant crops have had wide-ranging
detrimental effects, including glyphosate resistant super weeds,
virulent plant (and new livestock) pathogens, reduced crop health and
yield, harm to off-target species from insects to amphibians and
livestock, as well as reduced soil fertility.
Politics Trumps Science
In light of these adverse findings, why have
Washington and the European Commission continued to endorse glyphosate as
safe?
Critics point to lax regulations, heavy influence from corporate
lobbyists, and a political agenda that has more to do with power and control
than protecting the health of the people.
In the ground-breaking 2007 book
Seeds
of Destruction - The Hidden Agenda of Genetic Manipulation, William Engdahl states that global food control and depopulation became US strategic
policy under Rockefeller protégé Henry Kissinger. Along with oil
geopolitics, they were to be the new "solution" to the threats to US global
power and continued US access to cheap raw materials from the developing
world.
In line with that agenda, the government has shown extreme
partisanship in favor of the biotech agribusiness industry, opting for a
system in which the industry "voluntarily" polices itself. Bio-engineered
foods are treated as "natural food additives," not needing any special
testing.
Jeffrey M. Smith, Executive Director of
the Institute for Responsible Technology,
confirms that US Food and
Drug Administration policy allows biotech companies to determine if their
own foods are safe. Submission of data is completely voluntary.
He
concludes:
In the critical arena of food safety
research, the biotech industry is without accountability, standards, or
peer-review. Theyve got bad science down to a science.
Whether or not depopulation is an intentional
part of the agenda,
widespread use of GMO and glyphosate is
having that result,
The
endocrine-disrupting properties of glyphosate have been linked to
infertility, miscarriage, birth defects and arrested sexual development. In
Russian experiments, animals fed GM soy were sterile by the third
generation.
Vast amounts of farmland soil are also being systematically
ruined by the killing of beneficial microorganisms that allow plant roots to
uptake soil nutrients.
In Gary Nulls eye-opening documentary
Seeds of Death -
Unveiling the Lies of GMOs, Dr. Bruce Lipton warns,
"We are leading the world into the sixth
mass extinction of life on this planet... Human behavior is undermining
the web of life."
The TPP and International Corporate Control
As the devastating conclusions of these and
other researchers awaken people globally to the dangers of Roundup and GMO
foods, transnational corporations are working feverishly with
the Obama
administration to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade
agreement that would strip governments of the power to regulate
transnational corporate activities.
Negotiations have been kept secret from
Congress but not from corporate advisors, 600 of whom have been consulted
and know the details.
According to Barbara Chicherio in Nation of Change:
The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) has the
potential to become the biggest regional Free Trade Agreement in
history. . . .
The chief agricultural negotiator for the US
is the former Monsanto lobbyist, Islam Siddique. If ratified the TPP
would impose punishing regulations that give multinational corporations
unprecedented right to demand taxpayer compensation for policies that
corporations deem a barrier to their profits.
...They are carefully crafting the TPP to
insure that citizens of the involved countries have no control over food
safety, what they will be eating, where it is grown, the conditions
under which food is grown and the use of herbicides and pesticides.
Food safety is only one of many rights and
protections liable to fall to this super-weapon of international corporate
control.
In an
April 2013 interview on The Real News
Network, Kevin Zeese called
the TPP "NAFTA on steroids" and "a global corporate coup." He warned:
No matter what issue you care about - whether
its wages, jobs, protecting the environment... this issue is going to
adversely affect it... If a country takes a step to try to regulate
the financial industry or set up a public bank to represent the public
interest, it can be sued...
Return to Nature - Not Too
Late
There is a safer, saner, more earth-friendly way
to feed nations.
While Monsanto and US regulators are forcing GM crops on
American families, Russian families are showing what can be done with permaculture methods on simple garden plots.
In 2014,
40% of Russias food will grown on
dachas (cottage gardens or
allotments).
Dacha gardens produced over 80% of the countrys fruit and
berries, over 66% of the vegetables, almost 80% of the potatoes and nearly
50% of the nations milk, much of it consumed raw.
According to Vladimir Megre, author of the best-selling
Ringing Cedars
Series:
Essentially, what Russian gardeners do is
demonstrate that gardeners can feed the world - and you do not need any GMOs,
industrial farms, or any other technological gimmicks to guarantee
everybodys got enough food to eat.
Bear in mind that Russia only has 110
days of growing season per year - so in the US, for example, gardeners
output could be substantially greater.
Today, however, the area taken up by
lawns in the US is two times greater than that of Russias gardens - and it
produces nothing but a multi-billion-dollar lawn care industry.
In the US,
only about 0.6 percent
of the total agricultural area is devoted to organic farming. This area
needs to be vastly expanded if we are to avoid "the sixth mass extinction."
But first, we need to urge our representatives to stop Fast Track, vote no
on the TPP, and pursue a global phase-out of glyphosate-based herbicides and
GMO foods.
Our health, our finances and our environment are at stake.
