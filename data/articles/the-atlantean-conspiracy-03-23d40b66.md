Big Brother
Surveillance Society
There are over 30 million closed-circuit television cameras in America
recording 247, catching the average citizen on film nearly 200 times daily.
Every American has a 9digit government Social Security number assigned to
them at birth.
We require government licenses to drive, to get married, and
have pets, government passports to travel, and corporate credit cards to
book tickets, make reservations, and shop online. Our phone lines are tapped
and our emails are compiled and saved. Intelligence agencies and
corporations share and maintain huge databases full of information on every
citizen.
The government, corporate, and media interests have all melded into
one cohesive unit, propagating the official version of reality through
every newspaper and TV set.
One cartoon, featuring the character Buzz Lightyear recently ran an episode
where a delivery was being made to the superheros home by a futuristic
mailman. In this cartoon, the deliveryman used not only a retinal scan but
also DNA to verify the identity of the recipient.
If we were to show you all
the evidence in childrens cartoons and media of face scanning, thumb
scanning, national ID cards, and the overall police state, this book would
be five hundred pages long.

They are
already training our children to be prisoners. Schools are already filled
with CCTV cameras, metal detectors, and special police security guards. Now
students are being forced to show IDs or use thumb-scanners to receive lunch,
and many schools have outlawed backpacks and all non see-through bags. On top
of this there are increasing reports of the police security guards
harassing and assaulting innocent students.
In September, 2007, a 16 year old
girl had her arm broken and was arrested after refusing to clean up a
dropped piece of cake. Two other students who filmed the incident on their
phones were then tackled and arrested, one of them spending over a week in
jail for simply daring to do so. Then the students mother was charged with
assault when brushing past the principal to find her daughter after 20
minutes of waiting.
The mother, a teacher at another district, was suspended
for 2 weeks without pay.
The security officer was suspended for 2 weeks with
pay. (http://www.infowars.net/articles/september2007/280907Cake.htm)
Washington, D.C., has already implemented a card which is held with the
CIA and the National Security Agency for all children. It contains all
kinds of biometric information face scans, thumb prints, you name it
(Washington Post, August 15, 2001, DC Plans ID Card for Students). If the
children want their school lunches, they have to thumb scan to get them. No
thumb scan, no food (ABCNews.com, January 10, 2002, Finger Food; CBS News,
January 24, 2002, Fingerprints Pay for School Lunch).
All this trains the
children for the cashless society and gets them into the database. Think
about it. Thumb scanning in government schools to get food. You would expect
to read about something like this in Aldous Huxleys
Brave New World or
George Orwells
1984, but its actually happening . . . and its only the
beginning. Its not just children who are being conditioned. Adults across
the land are biometrically scanning to bank. And not just bank but to get
their lunches too, at Kroger and HEB food stores from Texas to New York.

Now the Feds have expanded their tracking control grid by passing a law
that all new cell phones, starting in October 2001, have to be satellite
trackable so they know exactly where youre at... for your safety (September 16, 1999, Feds OK Cell Phone Tracking; CNET News.com, November
10, 2000, Wireless phone tracking plans raise privacy hackles).
Whatever
happened to the Fourth Amendment? Then theres OnStar.
The federal
government is in talks with the states to force everyone to have an OnStartype tracking system in their car for tracking as well as taxation
purposes. Private companies are racing ahead to implement this Big Brother
system. Rental car companies are imposing fines of $450 for going one mile
over the speed limit (ZDNet News, June 19, 2001, Car spy pushes privacy
limit), and thats if you pass the thumb scan to get the rental car (Wired
News, November 21, 2001, No Thumbprint, No Rental Car)

Now the surveillance society is getting even more intrusive and more
technological. Stoplight cameras are catching offenders and sending out
fines without a
human-being involved.
Biometrics, retina-scanners, and
thumbprint reading technology are becoming the norm in amusement parks,
schools, banks, and grocery stores.
Last but not least, Radio Frequency
Identification Chips (RFID) are being implanted in pets, children,
prisoners, and Alzheimers patients. New laws are being created to force
these microchips into licenses, passports, and corporate products.
The
New
World Order end goal is chipping every baby at birth and transferring global
currency to a cashless credit-based system, managed via microchips.
They
implement their agenda incrementally, however; they walk the totalitarian
tiptoe as
David Icke says, so we
do not consciously notice the gradual erosion of our rights/privacy.
I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the
people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent
and sudden usurpations."
US President James Madison
The people in control of everything that is happening in your world now
have identification microchips. They are inserted into the human body with a
hypodermic needle, as small as the hypodermic needles used for insulin
injection (which are 29 gauge) and for those of you that are not familiar
with medical terminology, that is so tiny that you could be injected with
the needle and never feel it.
You have to understand that the technology is
so sophisticated that they have managed to create a complete full capability
computer and power generator down to the size of a single human cell and
inject them into the human body in places like the top side of the hand,
forehead, shoulder, and their favorite place is behind the right ear
I
believe these chips are part of the Mark of the Beast that is talked about
in Rev. 13:1517
Among these microchips is one that is for the transcending
of data which includes such items as follow: 1. Name and Picture 2. Social
Security number 3. Fingerprint Data 4. Physical Description 5. Address 6.
Family History 7. Occupation and Income
8. Tax Information 9. Criminal record

"The end goal is to get everybody chipped, to control the whole society, to
have the bankers and the elite people control the world.
Nick Rockefeller, as quoted in Aaron Russo interview, 2005
Shortly after 9/11 there was a whole family on Good Morning America who
all got
chipped. They interviewed with
CFR member
Diane Sawyer saying they
were scared of the terrorists and felt safer with implanted identification
devices. The government is now pushing legislation to chip animals,
children, prisoners, and Alzheimers patients.
Andy Rooney even promoted the
idea in a 60 Minutes editorial:
Something has to change, though. They have to find a better way to identify
the bad guys, or the rest of us are going to stay home and watch the world
go by on television. But we need some system for permanently identifying
safe people. Most of us are
never going to blow anything up. And theres got to be something better than
one of these photo IDs a tattoo somewhere maybe.
The Saudis use an American
device to scan the eyes of travelers. I wouldnt mind having something
planted permanently in my arm that would identify me. If we dont do
something, people are going to stop flying. If they stop flying, and I dont
go to the Giants games, it means the bastards have won.
