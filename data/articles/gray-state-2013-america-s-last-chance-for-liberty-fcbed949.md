"Those who desire to give up freedom
in order to gain security will not have,
nor do they deserve, either one."
Benjamin Franklin
The Gray State is the dystopian consequence of generations of American
complacency.
As we enjoyed our standard of living, globalist powers laid
plans spanning decades to slowly erode our constitutional rights and civil
liberties to the point where we mindlessly support invasive foreign wars for
profit while tolerating being sexually groped for security.
The Gray State
is not coming... it's here.
If you've been following the Gray State effort, you know that it is a
simultaneous expos√© on the dissolution of our bill of rights at the hands of
a tyrannical government AND a narrative feature film.
Even though the effort
has been going on two years, it is still in its infancy as it gather steam
to plow ahead into big-budget production.
So if this is something you care
about, please contribute to the cause, as we're going to be taking the
opportunity to initiate grassroots marketing, spread the word to the
thousands of liberty-minded people at the RNC, go on radio shows, and
approach potential investors.
This is a HUGE move for the Gray State effort,
so if it's a message you care about, please help us out.
Is Gray State a Psy-Op?

In answer to the question posed in the title of
this piece, this writer does not have a definitive answer one way or the
other.
There are, however, several aspects of this
trailer that point to this being a psy-op. If you are on a website that
would post this article, then there is very good chance youve seen the
trailer for the movie Gray State as seen below.
Condensed, the movie addresses what it would be like
if
FEMA began round-ups and executions of US citizens.
The trailer (above
video), 2:40 long, seems to have one goal in mind; to instill
fear in the viewer.
It is devoted to violent graphic scenes of
round-ups; direct head shot executions and intimidating footage of faceless
FEMA soldiers goose stepping toward defiant, rioting citizens. The trailer
is laced with heavy machine gun sounds, buzzing helicopters, people
screaming, and death; lots of death.
On the surface, one might applaud the intrepid director and crew, facing
down Hollywood (much ado is made of this fact in interviews), and, even more
so, having the stones to make a movie depicting our government in such a
harsh light. But the surface is just that; a surface and we live in an age
of deception.
Thanks to the Internet reformation, the plans of the globalists have been
laid bare. The tricks they employ are numerous and come at us from every
angle.
This movie trailer would appear to satisfy two
of their primary objectives within the paradigm of this deception.
-
The first objective of the trailer is to
instill fear and hopelessness into the population, which it
effectively does.
-
The second feat accomplished is to give
warning of what is yet to come.
It is well documented that globalist-controlled
Hollywood is complicit in these types of pre-alert efforts by allowing
television shows and movies to become vehicles of warning to the populace.
There is massive evidence pointing to this modus operandi; 9-11, here and
Sandy Hook, here are two recent examples.
There are many more, but this space does not
allow for a list, and this is not the focus of this piece.
We cannot claim that we werent warned in advance of any number of
calamities; those in the past and those yet to come. The globalist stamp is
all over this project. The globalists, (one might think not human by their
actions) are just people at the end of the day, and people make mistakes.
The Aurora, Co. shooting was rife with errors,
here, and here. Sandy Hook was even worse, here, from a production
standpoint (which from a globalist view was a production, no less so than a
staging of Othello at the Met).
There are a number of tells associated with this project. A tell is a
term used to describe the actions (and thus indicators) of a deception. Most
commonly referred to in conjunction with gambling and gamblers themselves,
the term is apropos here as applied to markers that this trailer is (in all
likelihood unbeknownst to the entire cast and crew) a project of globalist
emanation.
The trailer focuses on real-life proposals by
the elites, such as RFID chips, QE IV, and martial law. Sub themes include
empty grocery shelves, cameras in homes, the ripping apart of loved ones and
the heavy boot of the state.
At the end of the trailer, the last shot shows a
pyramid, a favorite image of the elites.
Google and YouTube, two of the most powerful (globalists owned) Internet
companies on the planet are fully on board with the promotion of this
trailer. A Google search brought up Gray State after typing in only gray st.
After ten pages (11 listings each page) it didnt slow down - the listings
went on and on.
What movie trailer in history has yielded such
buzz?
Remember, this is a trailer. No release date was
announced then and none has been forthcoming, (This in itself is suspect.
The trailer was made in 2011 and here we are in 2013. There is zero
information online pertaining to a release date. It appears the trailer was
made and that was it. One could almost call it a mini-movie production of
and by itself.)
Most of the numerous links are to alternative news sites such as Prison
Planet.
Many of the site links are to dis-info shill
sites known for being so. There is a great consistency to all the links - in
every one there is a hyperlink to the trailer. It would appear the primary
goal is to get people to watch the trailer. On YouTube, there are 492,260
views and numerous pages of ancillary interviews and analysis.
These analysis focus on the feasibility of the
concept of Gray State becoming a reality. In one interview with an actor in
the trailer, he stated there was a lot of work to do in the trailer.
He held up his fingers in the Quote-Unquote
sign as he said trailer. That type of hand gesture is used to indicate
(among other things) that what is being quoted is not the actuality of
what is being inferred.
Research into the production company for Gray State, Hot Head Productions,
from Minnesota, proved to be a dead end. There is a website for a Hot Head
Productions in New York, but not the company sought. The only site
discovered relating to the correct Hot Head Productions is here, but the
phone number on the site is to a locksmith that has had the same number for
seven years.
There is very little information on David Crowley, the director and writer.
There are many sites with interviews of him about the trailer, what it means
to society, etc. etc. But there is nothing on the man himself. In this age
of LinkedIn, FB, Twitter and the like, one would think there would be
something on the guy, but there is nothing. His bio indicates he likes
making movies, (but does not list any) and that he was in the army. Thats
it.
A search to discover the source of the initial funding remains unknown, not
for lack of trying. None of the interviews reveal this fact.
One interview has Crowley claiming the trailer
cost six thousand dollars to make. The trailer has tanks, helicopters,
exploding buildings and uber-expensive military gear. It doesnt take an MBA
to know that, with all the explosions and heavy duty armaments, tanks etc.
it cost a hell of a lot more than six grand to make.
Where do these resources come from?
In an interview with Crowley, he claimed the
trailer generated $67,000.00 in investment money. He indicated this would be
used to create a media package to help draw investors for the movie. Wait a
minute! The trailer was allegedly created to bring in investors. Now that
that has been done, and $67K has been brought in, that money will be used
to
draw investors?
The company that supplied the weapons and heavy armaments is The Bullet
Exchange, here. The owners of The Bullet Exchange are revealed to be David
Crowley (Director and Writer, GS), Mitch Heil (Director of Photography, GS),
and Danny Mason, (Lead Actor, GS).
The companys C.V. reveals that they worked on
two other movies, Pandemic, here and Problem Solving the Republic, here.
Both movies underlying meme is the government is staffed with malevolent
people intent on bearing us ill will.
Crowleys bio on the site lists,
Experience: 5 years Army infantry, squad
leader, Deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Heil shows,
Experience: Five years in the 82nd
Airborne, Deployed to Afghanistan for 12 months and Iraq for 14 months.
The question to be posed is this:
How do Crowley and Heil go from being gung
ho soldiers to dissident filmmakers? How do they accomplish this feat of
rebellion whilst drawing on their contacts accrued from years of
military service?
One would think, if Team Crowley is genuinely
rebellion minded in their project, that the Army, if not discouraging the
film, would certainly not endorse the project to the point they help supply
the gear to make it a reality.
This smacks of psy-op collusion.
Psy-ops are the children of one acronymed agency or another. To obtain tanks
one needs permission of the Federists and, well, tanks.
Tanks come from the government, and the
government would not willingly loan out tanks to be employed in a movie
depicting them in this harsh light unless someone, somewhere had not granted
approval. If this movie was independent and truly anti-government as claimed
then it makes sense they would not have the cooperation of the government
for the trailer.
The underlying message the trailer imparts rolls across the screen to the
sound of guns blazing,
With every weapon of the state turned
against us, how long can we resist?
There is no hope offered in this trailer.
There is no resolution and no happy ending -
nothing but fear and panic inducing images and sounds. It is really little
more than another salvo, fired by the elites, to further diminish our
feelings of security and well being.
Rather than succumb to the fear, there are wise
words to ponder as an antidote to soul poisoning fear.
Only focusing on what is wrong is a trap
that just feeds the machine. We must really focus on creating what we
want, even if doing so only makes it easier for future generations.
The elites want us to focus on negativity.
This mindset, aided via media projects like this
trailer succeed in germinating fear and negativity. Perhaps this trailer
is not disingenuous at all, and is exactly what it purports itself to be.
But in this age of deception where the globalist
enemy controls every aspect of our existence, the chances of this being a
genuine concept trailer are slim. Based on the results of this cursory
investigation as outlined above, one might conclude Gray State just doesnt
add up.
From a globalist point of view, why make a whole
movie (costing many millions), when for a fraction of that cost, they can
create the same amount of fear just by pushing a well-made trailer?

This author recently posted an article titled
Is Gray State a Psy-Op? (above article).
It quickly went, if not viral, then at least
reposted on dozens of alt-news sites. The comments ran from (condensed)
Those evil globalist bastards! Hollywood is evil! to Your article is a
joke and poorly written, not researched and a slam on a legitimate
endeavor.
David Crowley, the director, contacted me and he graciously agreed to
a phone interview.
Given the initial medium of the article itself,
I felt the best format would be this one. There were numerous points in the
initial piece that upon my own reflection I deemed too trivial to address.
My questions posed were culled from two sources:
I will say that I feel I have been taught a
personal lesson in journalism, and I will not forget it.
I also wish to point out that not everything
that seems evil is evil.
There are people out there that have the vision
and fortitude to not only think about the problems we face, but actually
endeavor to change the dynamic of that in which we find ourselves.
After speaking with David Crowley and reading
his replies to my questions, I am convinced he is indeed genuine in his
efforts to wake up the populace as much as his vehicle can accomplish.
