'The situation is about as serious and
difficult
as I've experienced in my career.'
You know George Soros. Hes the investors
investor - the man who still holds the record for making more money in a
single days trading than anyone.
He pocketed $1 billion betting against the
British pound on Black Wednesday in 1992, when sterling lost 20 percent of
its value in less than 24 hours and crashed out of the European
exchange-rate mechanism.
No wonder Brits call him, with a mix of awe and
annoyance,
the man who broke the Bank of England.
Soros doesnt make small bets on anything.
Beyond the markets, he has plowed billions of dollars of his own money into
promoting political freedom in Eastern Europe and other causes. He bet
against the Bush White House, becoming a hate magnet for the right that
persists to this day.
So, as Soros and the worlds movers once again
converge on Davos, Switzerland, for the
World Economic Forum this week, what
is one of the worlds highest-stakes economic gamblers betting on now?
Hes not.
For the first time in his 60-year career, Soros, now 81, admits he
is not sure what to do.
Its very hard to know how you can be
right, given the damage that was done during the boom years, Soros
says.
He wont discuss his portfolio, lest anyone
think hes talking things down to make a buck.
But people who know him well
say he advocates making long-term stock picks with solid companies, avoiding
gold - the ultimate bubble - and, mainly, holding cash.
Hes not even doing the one thing that you would expect from a man who knows
a crippled currency when he sees one: shorting the euro, and perhaps even
the U.S. dollar, to hell. Quite the reverse.
He backs the beleaguered euro, publicly urging
European leaders to do whatever it takes to ensure its survival.
The euro must survive because the
alternative - a breakup - would cause a meltdown that Europe, the world,
cant afford.
He has bought about $2 billion in European
bonds, mainly Italian, from MF Global Holdings Ltd., the securities firm run
by former Goldman Sachs head Jon Corzine that filed for bankruptcy
protection last October.
Has the great short seller gone soft? Well, yes.
Sitting in his 33rd-floor
corner office high above Seventh Avenue in New York, preparing for his trip
to Davos, he is more concerned with surviving than staying rich.
At times like these, survival is the most
important thing, he says, peering through his owlish glasses and
brushing wisps of gray hair off his forehead.
He doesnt just mean its time to protect your
assets. He means its time to stave off disaster.
As he
sees it, the world faces one of the most dangerous periods of modern history
- a period of evil.
-
Europe is confronting a descent into chaos and
conflict
-
In America he predicts riots on the streets that will lead to a
brutal clampdown that will dramatically curtail civil liberties
-
The global economic system could even collapse
altogether

I am not here to cheer you up. The
situation is about as serious and difficult as Ive experienced in my
career, Soros tells Newsweek.
We are facing an extremely difficult time,
comparable in many ways to the 1930s, the Great Depression. We are
facing now a general retrenchment in the developed world, which
threatens to put us in a decade of more stagnation, or worse.
Soross warning is based as much on his own
extraordinary personal history as on his gut instinct for market booms and
busts.
I did survive a personally much more
threatening situation, so it is emotional, as well as rational, he
acknowledges.
Soros was just 13 when Nazi soldiers invaded and
occupied his native Hungary in March 1944.
In only eight weeks, almost half
a million Hungarian Jews were deported, many to Auschwitz. He saw bodies of Jews, and the Christians who
helped them, swinging from lampposts, their skulls crushed. He survived,
thanks to his father, Tivadar, who managed to secure false identities for
his family.
Later, he watched as Russian forces ousted the
Nazis and a new totalitarian ideology, communism, replaced fascism. As life
got tougher during the postwar Soviet occupation, Soros managed to emigrate,
first to London, then to New York.
Soros draws on his past to argue that the global economic crisis is as
significant, and unpredictable, as the end of communism.
The collapse of the Soviet system was a
pretty extraordinary event, and we are currently experiencing something
similar in the developed world, without fully realizing whats
happening.
To Soros, the spectacular debunking of the credo
of efficient markets - the notion that markets are rational and can regulate
themselves to avert disaster,
is comparable to the collapse of Marxism as
a political system. The prevailing interpretation has turned out to be
very misleading. It assumes perfect knowledge, which is very far removed
from reality. We need to move from the Age of Reason to the Age of
Fallibility in order to have a proper understanding of the problems.
Understanding, he says, is key.
Unrestrained competition can drive people
into actions that they would otherwise regret. The tragedy of our
current situation is the unintended consequence of imperfect
understanding. A lot of the evil in the world is actually not
intentional. A lot of people in the financial system did a lot of damage
without intending to.
Still, Soros believes the West is struggling to
cope with the consequences of evil in the financial world just as former
Eastern bloc countries struggled with it politically.
Is he really saying that the financial whizzes
behind our economic meltdown were not just wrong, but evil?
Thats correct.
Take that, Lloyd Blankfein, the Goldman Sachs
boss
who told The Sunday Times of London at the height of the financial
crisis that bankers do Gods work.
To many, the idea of Soros lecturing the world on evil is, well, rich.
Here, after all, is an investor who proved - and profited hugely from - the
now much-derided notion that the market, or in his case a single investor,
is more powerful than sovereign governments.
He broke the Bank of England, destroyed the
Conservative Partys reputation for economic competence, and reduced the
value of the pound in British consumers pockets by one fifth in a single
day. Soros the currency speculator has been condemned as unnecessary,
unproductive, immoral.
Mahathir Mohamad, former prime minister of
Malaysia, once called him criminal and a moron.
In the U.S., where the right still has not forgiven him for agitating
against President
George W. Bush and the war on terror after 9/11, which
he described as pernicious, his prediction of riots on the streets - its
already started, he says - will likely spark fresh criticism that Soros is
a far-left, radical bomb thrower, as Bill OReilly
once put it.
Critics already allege he is stoking the fires
by funding the Occupy movement through Adbusters, the Canadian provocateurs
who sparked the movement. Not so, says Soros.
Soross fragrant personal life will also prompt many to pooh-pooh his
moralizing.
Last year, Adriana Ferreyr, his
28-year-old companion for many years, sued him in New York Supreme Court in
Manhattan, alleging he reneged on two separate promises to buy her an
apartment, causing her extreme emotional distress. Ferreyr, a former
soap-opera star in Brazil, said Soros had given the apartment he had
promised her to another girlfriend.
She also claimed he assaulted her.
Soros has
dismissed Ferreyrs claims as,
frivolous and entirely without merit and
riddled with false charges and obviously an attempt to extract money.
Despite his baggage, the man who now views himself as a
statesman-philanthropist is undeterred. Having profited from unregulated
markets, he now wants to deliver us from them. Take Europe.
Hes now convinced that,
if you have a disorderly collapse of the
euro, you have the danger of a revival of the political conflicts that
have torn Europe apart over the centuries - an extreme form of
nationalism, which manifests itself in xenophobia, the exclusion of
foreigners and ethnic groups.
In Hitlers time, that was focused on the
Jews. Today, you have that with the Gypsies, the Roma, which is a small
minority, and also, of course, Muslim immigrants.
It is, now more likely than not that Greece will
formally default in 2012, Soros will tell leaders in Davos this week.
He
will castigate European leaders who seem to know only how to,
do enough
to calm the situation, not to solve the problem.
If Germanys Angela Merkel or Frances Nicolas Sarkozy nurses any lingering hopes of finding their salvation outside the
continent, they are mistaken.
I took a recent trip to China, and China
wont come to Europes rescue, Soros says.
Despite all its woes, he nevertheless thinks the
Euro will - just barely - survive.
While Soros, whose new book,
Financial Turmoil in Europe and the United
States, will be published in early February, is currently focused on Europe,
hes quick to claim that economic and social divisions in the U.S. will
deepen, too.
He sympathizes with the Occupy movement, which
articulates a widespread disillusionment with capitalism that he shares.
People have reason to be frustrated and angry at the cost of rescuing the
banking system, a cost largely borne by taxpayers rather than shareholders
or bondholders.
Occupy Wall Street,
is an inchoate, leaderless manifestation of protest,
but it will grow. It has, put on the agenda issues that the
institutional left has failed to put on the agenda for a quarter of a
century.
He reaches for analysis, produced by the
political blog ThinkProgress.org, that shows how the Occupy movement has
pushed issues of unemployment up the agenda of major news organizations,
including MSNBC, CNN, and Fox News.
It reveals that in one week in July of last year
the word debt was mentioned more than 7,000 times on major U.S. TV news
networks.
By October, mentions of the word debt had
dropped to 398 over the course of a week, while occupy was mentioned 1,278
times, Wall Street 2,378 times, and jobs 2,738 times. You cant keep a
financier away from his metrics.
As anger rises, riots on the streets of American cities are inevitable.
Yes, yes, yes, he says, almost gleefully.
The response to the unrest could be more
damaging than the violence itself.
It will be an excuse for cracking down and
using strong-arm tactics to maintain law and order, which, carried to an
extreme, could bring about a repressive political system, a society
where individual liberty is much more constrained, which would be a
break with the tradition of the United States.
In spite of his warnings of political turmoil in
the U.S., he has no plans to engage in politics directly.
I would prefer not to be involved in party
politics. Its only because I felt that
the Bush administration was
misleading the country that I became involved.
I was very hopeful of a
new beginning with Obama, and Ive been somewhat disappointed. I remain
a supporter of the Democratic Party, but Im fully aware of their
shortcomings.
Soros believes
Obama still has a chance of
winning this years election.
Obama might surprise the public. The main
issue facing the electorate is whether the rich should be taxed more. It
shouldnt be a difficult argument for Obama to make.
If there is a glimmer of hope for the world in
2012, Soros believes it lies in emerging markets.
The democratic-reform movement that has spread
across the Middle East, the rise of democracy and economic growth in Africa,
even reform in Russia may yet drag the world out of the mire.
While the developed world is in a deep
crisis, the future for the developing world is very positive. The
aspiration of people for an open society is very inspiring. You have
people in Africa lining up for many hours when they are given an
opportunity to vote. Dictators have been overthrown. It is very
encouraging for freedom and growth.
Soros insists the key to avoiding cataclysm in
2012 is not to let the crises of 2011 go to waste.
In the crisis period, the impossible
becomes possible. The European Union could regain its luster. Im
hopeful that the United States, as a political entity, will pass a very
severe test and actually strengthen the institution.
Nor has he quite given up hope that the central
bankers and prime ministers
gathering in Davos this week have got what it
takes to rally round and prove him wrong.
This time, being wrong would make him happy
indeed.
