Maybe its the smoke from Mt. Vesuvius that
keeps
Arianna Huffington and the financial
community from seeing that the economic collapse has nothing to do with the
FED "missing" the warning signs leading up to the October meltdown.
Things do not happen. Things are made to
happen.
- John F. Kennedy
The FED didnt miss anything; the
October meltdown was an inside job.
Capitalism never made
sense
Professor Ebeling, the Ludwig von Mises professor of Economics at
Hillsdale College, understood something was wrong when he wrote:
"the perverse development and evolution of
historical capitalism, the institutions necessary for a truly
free-market economy have been either undermined or prevented from
emerging."
But when he claimed,
"it is the principles and the meaning of a
free-market economy that must be rediscovered" in order to overcome the
burden of historical capitalism and save liberty, he should have written
that principles must be rediscovered in order to prevent the planet from
attempted murder (ecocide).
American "capitalism" and our consumer economy
never made economic, environmental or common sense - unless the goal was
ecocide. Capitalism and a not-so-free market economy based on consumer
products, that is, products we are manipulated to want, not need, was never
sustainable.
Consumers consume
the resources of the planet.
Who is responsible?
Arianna said its time to,
"recognize the natural order of things: that
is, the very people responsible for the economic collapse not only are
still in power, but are still lining their pockets with outrageous
windfalls - courtesy of the American taxpayer.
The people responsible for the October collapse,
our
Federal Reserve, also get credit for the windfalls of Monopoly
Money, created out of thin air, which financed our consumer society.
They are the private credit monopoly of rich
and predatory moneylenders that,
prey upon the people of the United States
for the benefit of themselves. [1]
For the Benefit of the middle class is a more
accurate statement.
Those predatory moneylenders gave the middle class the highest standard of
living in the world. Recall when the American economy appeared headed into a
recession at the end of the dot-com bubble, the Federal Reserve began
slashing short- term interest rates until they reached a historically low
one percent.
The move re-inflated the economy by allowing
homeowners to extract $750 billion in equity from their homes - up from $106
billion in 1996 - and apply the dollars toward a multitude of consumer items
and other credit card debt.
As interest rates plummeted and alleged home equity artificially soared,
buyers were able to afford first and second homes, and they did it by taking
out risky mortgages with "teaser rates" similar to those offered by the
credit card industry. Even as interest rates adjusted upward, the sponsoring
banks used complicated financial derivatives to resell the risky mortgages
as "asset-backed paper."
As housing prices edged downward and mortgage rates inched upward, the
recession was put on hold with the help of an astonishing 10 to 12 credit
card offers per month being delivered to some consumer mailboxes.
The credit card companies issued 1.5 billion
cards to 158 million cardholders and promised an improbable zero percent
interest - some deals for up to 18 months. (Similar to mortgage debt, the
credit card debt is put into pools also known as derivatives that are then
resold to investment houses, other banks and institutional investors.)
Thank those rich and predatory moneylenders for the short-term interest
rates and the liquidity that allowed the debt to be pooled, sold and resold.
But blame them because our hyper-shopping has
wreaked havoc on the planet.
Who is Behind the
Federal Reserve?
Rockefeller, Kuhn, Loeb and Morgan - all
connected to the
House of Rothschilds global financial
empire, direct the Federal Reserve to create money out of thin air.
The process that the Federal Reserve, or any
bank, uses to create money,
consists of making an entry in a book, that
is all, said Graham Towers, governor of the Bank of Canada. Each and
every time a bank makes a loan (a debt)... new bank credit is created -
brand new money.
Money used to pay for the Industrial Revolution,
orchestrate the Great Depression, the stagflation of the 1970s and the
dot-com and the housing market bubbles, all of which resulted in 60 years of
unprecedented prosperity for the middle class.
These scoundrels, all connected to the House of
Rothschild, at the beginning of the 20th century, owned or
controlled one-sixth of the worlds real wealth:
-
raw materials
-
commodities
-
copper
-
iron ore
-
petroleum
-
lead
-
silver
-
gold
So how do they get rich exchanging real wealth
for about $500 trillion of the Monopoly money they printed? They dont, they
are the losers, not the middle class!
Remember those trees we chopped down so just about anyone in America could
afford their dream house, or those mountains we blew up so we could have
that fat station wagon in our driveway?
All of those resources now used up, were once
owned or controlled by the scoundrels of our history books. Their real
wealth, not yours or mine has been "cut, mined and hauled away" so Americans
could trash the planet with houses, second houses, cars, RVs, TVs and DVDs -
the cheap stuff we associate with the good life that put the planet
on the downward spiral to ecocide.
The middle class should be thanking those scoundrels for all that "stuff" -
but blame them for conning us into trashing the planet.
The Story of Stuff
The Story of Stuff, an animated video (below) about the underside of our consumer
society, believes the scoundrels are a bloated corporation sporting a top
hat with a dollar sign etched on its front.
Film narrator, Annie Leonard argues our
environmental damage is the result of the greedy corporations externalizing
costs (shift them onto the public and the environment) so they can make more
money.
But that premise is contradicted on film when Annie stands in line to buy a
radio for $4.99 and correctly realizes the price couldnt possibly capture
the cost of the radio but incorrectly concludes that the greedy corporations
pollute the environment so they can make more profit. [2]
If profits were the motive, then why wasnt the
radio $5.99? A price anyone would consider a "throw away" or loss leader.
We have come to believe that everything wrong in America is about someone
getting rich while we are getting swindled. That our economy runs on profits
is a true statement, but imagine how much those moneygrubbers would have
made if the radio was $5.99. That $1.00 would be 100% pure profit.
The swindlers and scoundrels downward-manipulate the costs, that is, they
manipulate the prices lower, not higher as you would expect, so the
corporations can still make a profit selling you a radio for $4.99. [3]
Annie should be asking herself why those
scoundrels intentionally sold their raw materials cheaply so just about
everyone could afford the American Dream, a nightmare for the Planet.
Ecocide Results in
Cognitive Dissonance
The premise that anyone would intentionally damage the planet, which future
generations will inherit, results in Cognitive Dissonance (CD). CD is the
discomfort felt at the discrepancy between what you already know or believe,
and new information or interpretation that contradicts a strongly held
belief system.
But what if the murder of the environment was the goal from the beginning
and not the unintended consequence, then we were "conned" into shopping for
stuff to intentionally weaken the planet? [4]
Now the world around you will finally make
sense. Hot, flat, and crowded Thomas L. Friedman will finally know what
planet
George W. Bush is on.
Bush lost the 'war on terrorism' and the war in Iraq, but is winning
the war
waged on the environment.
Dubya (George Bush Jr.) was deadly serious about
Ecocide when, after rejecting the global climate change targets of the July
2008 G8 summit, he said,
"Goodbye, from the (then) world's biggest
polluter." [5]
Ecocide Eliminates the
Stupid Explanations
We see the collapse of GM and Chrysler as the result of failed public
policy, government action, inaction and conclude the leadership is inept,
arrogant or just "stupid" because only Ecocide could explain an industry
that failed to keep up with the competition and adjust to new market
demands.
Did Detroit forget the Volkswagen Beetle was the most successful car in
history? An incredible 21,529,464 Beetles were produced with the same body
style and the same taillight. [6]
The policies and decisions for the last 31 years
arent inept or stupid if the goal was pollution. The Beetle as a mobile
pollution device was a failure. Its effects on the environment were minimal
compared to the Detroit lineup of egocentric gas-guzzlers, all designed with
a different taillight and eco-unfriendly accessories.
The Evil Federal Reserve made sure that shiny new automobile with the V8
engine, chrome wheels and bumpers was so cheap just about everyone in
America could afford the mobile pollution device of their dreams.
Ecocide Explains Why
Alaska is in the Picture
Most analysts point to the oil shock of the mid-1970s, set off by the Arab
oil embargo of 1973 as the turning point for the US economy and automobile
industry.
Why didnt our then-President Richard Nixon and
the rest of the U.S. government promote mass transit, renewable energy, and
high-mileage vehicles?
Because the objective that makes the most sense was to disturb 800 miles of
the most pristine country in Alaska with the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.
In 2008
we had a similar shock when $4.50 a gallon gasoline convinced Americans they
should give up their last Arctic wilderness. [7]
Ecocide Explains why
Electricity is so Cheap
Electricity radically transformed and expanded our energy use.
To a large extent, electricity defines modern
technological civilization and made the Industrial Revolution and therefore
our consumer society possible.
Electric power arrived barely a hundred years ago, but high costs and the
Great Depression dried up most investment capital and delayed electric
service to rural Americans until President Franklin Roosevelt signed into
law the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) in 1935. The REA loaned
money created by the Federal Reserve at low interest rates and helped to set
up electricity cooperatives.
Historically, energy is priced below its actual environmental and social
cost in order to create excessive demand and discourage conservation. In
other words such pricing diminishes the value of energy to users and causes
them to use it irresponsibly and increase the amount of pollution coal-fired
plants generate.
Why is electricity priced so cheap that "only the rich can afford to burn
candles"? Because cleaner alternatives like wind, solar or even natural gas
dont require mining companies to use dynamite to blast away 800 to 1,000
feet of 500 mountaintops and bury over 1200 miles of rivers and streams.
[8]
Ecocide explains why 54% of electricity comes from the most abundant raw
energy, coal and is the dirtiest source of power for much of the world.
Coal-fired plants harm wildlife, generate smog,
soot, acid rain, global warming, toxic air emissions and require billions of
gallons of our most precious resource - water.
He ruined the Country
The private credit monopoly of rich and predatory moneylenders do not prey
upon the middle class to get rich.
You dont become wealthier by exchanging gold, silver and raw materials for
about $500 trillion of the Monopoly money you print. Moneylenders created
the middle class and then conned us into trashing the planet because Ecocide
was the goal not the unintended consequence.
American "capitalism" and our consumer economy make perfect sense if the
goal was the attempted murder of the planet.
Maybe ecocide is what Wilson
meant when he confessed that he "ruined the country."

of the cost

accordingly.
[3] Downward manipulation is an uneconomic aberration discovered in the
precious metals market by the noted silver analyst Ted Butler. We are
conditioned to believe that prices are always inflated so the greedy
corporations can make more money but Ted Butlers research confirmed the
price of silver has been manipulated to stay at the $4-5 price range for
years. The beneficiaries of this type of manipulation are the consumers
since industrial users can sell their products cheaply and still make a
profit the customers get to buy a lot more radio for their dollar.

the dumping of mining waste into streams. More than one million acres of
Appalachia have already been affected by this practice, Senator
Alexander says,
"An estimated 1,200 miles of headwater streams have been
buried under tons of mining wastes. More than 500 mountains have been
impacted, and homes have been ruined and drinking water supplies
contaminated."
