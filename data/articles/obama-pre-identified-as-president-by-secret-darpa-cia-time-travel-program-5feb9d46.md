As a futurist at The Center
for the Study of Social Policy at Stanford Research Institute,
ALFRED LAMBREMONT WEBRE served as Principal Investigator for a
proposed civilian scientific study of extraterrestrial
communication, i.e., interactive communication between our
terrestrial human culture and that of possible intelligent
Off-Planet Cultures.
This proposed study was
presented to and developed with interested members of the
domestic policy staff of the White House of President Jimmy
Carter from the spring of 1977 until the fall of 1977, when it
was abruptly terminated.
A Fulbright Scholar, Webre
is a graduate of Yale University. He earned his Juris Doctor

at SRI, Webre was General Counsel to New York Citys EPA and was
an environmental consultant to the Ford Foundation.

Yale and Civil Liberties at the University of Texas and is an

Taskforce on Earthquake Preparedness for the State of California
(1980-82), a position Governor Jerry Brown appointed him to.
He produced and hosted The
Instant of Cooperation, the first live radio broadcast between
the United States and the former Soviet Union, which was carried
live by Gosteleradio and National Public Radio satellite radio
in 1987. He was elected a Clinton-Gore delegate to the 1996
Texas Democratic Convention.
Webre was a delegate to the
UNISPACE Outer Space Conference and an NGO representative at the
United Nations (Communications Coordination Committee for the

Today, Webre is a space activist who works with others to

Space Age society reintegrated with a larger, intelligent
Universe society.
