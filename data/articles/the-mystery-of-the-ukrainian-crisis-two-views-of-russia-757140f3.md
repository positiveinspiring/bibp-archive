Perhaps the single most intriguing mystery of
the Ukrainian crisis has to do with how the Foreign Service officer who
served as deputy national security advisor to Vice President
Dick Cheney
for two years, starting on the eve of the invasion of Iraq, became the Obama
administrations point person on Russia in 2014.
Victoria Nuland took office as
Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs a year ago
this week. She became the "driving force" within the administration to take
a tough line against Russia,
according to Geoff Dyer of the Financial Times.
It was Nuland who in February was secretly
taped, probably by the Russians, saying "F*** the EU" for dragging its feet
in supporting Ukrainian demonstrators seeking to displace its
democratically-elected pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, two
months after he rejected a trade agreement with the European Union in favor
of one with Russia.
She made a well-publicized trip to pass out food
in the rebels encampment on Kievs Maidan Square in the days before
Yanukovych fled to Moscow.
When Russian President Vladimir Putin
said the other day,
"Our Western partners, with the support of
fairly radically inclined and nationalist-leaning groups, carried out a
coup détat [in Ukraine]. No matter what anyone says, we all understand
what happened.
There are no fools among us. We all saw the symbolic pies
handed out on the Maidan," Nuland is the pie-giver he had in mind.
Before she was nominated to her current job,
Nuland was State Department spokesperson under Secretary Hillary Rodham
Clinton during the Congressional firestorm over the attack on the diplomatic
post in Benghazi, Libya.
So how did the Obama administration manage to
get her confirmed - on a voice vote
with no debate? The short answer is that she was
stoutly defended by New York Times columnist David Brooks
and
warmly endorsed by two prominent Republican senators, Lindsey Graham
of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona.
Clearly Nuland stands on one side of a major
fault-line in the shifting, often-confusing tectonic plates of US politics.
A good deal of light was shed on that divide by
John Mearsheimer, of the
University of Chicago, in an
essay earlier this month in Foreign Affairs.
In "Why the Ukraine Crisis Is the Wests Fault,"
Mearsheimer described the US ambitions to move Ukraine out of Russias orbit
via expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as the taproot of
the crisis.
Only after Yanukovych fled Ukraine did Putin
move to annex the Crimean peninsula, with its longstanding Russian naval
base.
Putins actions should be easy to
comprehend. A huge expanse of flat land that Napoleonic France, imperial
Germany, and Nazi Germany all crossed to strike at Russia itself,
Ukraine serves as a buffer state of enormous strategic importance to
Russia.
No Russian leader would tolerate a military
alliance that was Moscows mortal enemy until recently moving into
Ukraine. Nor would any Russian leader stand idly by while the West
helped install a government there that was determined to integrate
Ukraine into the West.
Washington may not like Moscows position,
but it should understand the logic behind it. This is Geopolitics 101:
great powers are always sensitive to potential threats near their home
territory.
After all, the United States does not
tolerate distant great powers deploying military forces anywhere in the
Western Hemisphere, much less on its borders. Imagine the outrage in
Washington if China built an impressive military alliance and tried to
include Canada and Mexico in it.
Logic aside, Russian leaders have told their
Western counterparts on many occasions that they consider NATO expansion
into Georgia and Ukraine unacceptable, along with any effort to turn
those countries against Russia a message that the 2008
Russian-Georgian war also made crystal clear.
Why does official Washington think any
different? (Its not just the Obama administration, but much of Congress as
well.)
Mearsheimer delineates a "liberal" view of
geopolitics that emerged at the end of the Cold War, as opposed to a more
traditional "realist" stance. He writes,
As the Cold War came to a close, Soviet
leaders preferred that U.S. forces remain in Europe and NATO stay
intact, an arrangement they thought would keep a reunified Germany
pacified.
But they and their Russian successors did not want NATO to
grow any larger and assumed that Western diplomats understood their
concerns. The Clinton administration evidently thought otherwise, and in
the mid-1990s, it began pushing for NATO to expand.
The first round of NATO expansion took place in
1999, and brought the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland into the treaty.
A second round in 2004 incorporated Bulgaria,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. None but the
tiny Baltic Republics shared a border with Russia. But in 2008, in a meeting
in Bucharest, the Bush administration proposed adding Georgia and Ukraine.
France and Germany demurred, but the communiqué in the end flatly declared,
"These countries will become members of NATO."
This time Putin issued a
clear rejoinder - a five-day war in 2008 which short-circuited Georgias
application (though Georgia apparently continues to hope).
The program of enlargement originated with key
members of the Clinton administration, according to Mearsheimer.
They believed that the end of the Cold War
had fundamentally transformed international politics and that a new,
post-national order had replaced the realist logic that used to govern
Europe.
The United States was not only the
"indispensable nation," as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright put it;
it was also a benign hegemon and thus unlikely to be viewed as a threat
in Moscow. The aim, in essence, was to make the entire continent look
like Western Europe.
In contrast, the realists who opposed expansion
did so in the belief that Russia had voluntarily joined the world trading
system and was no longer much of a threat to European peace.
A declining great power with an aging population
and a one-dimensional economy did not, they felt, need to be contained.
And they feared that enlargement would only give
Moscow an incentive to cause trouble in Eastern Europe.
The U.S. diplomat George Kennan
articulated this perspective in a 1998 interview, shortly after the U.S.
Senate approved the first round of NATO expansion.
"I think the Russians will gradually react
quite adversely and it will affect their policies," he said. "I think it
is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was
threatening anyone else."
Policies devised in one administration have a
way of hardening into boilerplate when embraced by the next.
So thoroughly have liberals come to dominate
discourse about European security that even the short war with Georgia has
done little to bring realists back into the conversation.
The February ouster of Yanukovych is either
cited as the will of a sovereign people yearning to be free or, more
frequently, simply ignored altogether.
The liberal worldview is now accepted dogma
among U.S. officials.
In March, for example, President Barack
Obama delivered a speech about Ukraine in which he talked repeatedly
about "the ideals" that motivate Western policy and how those ideals,
"have often been threatened by an older,
more traditional view of power."
Secretary of State John Kerrys response to
the Crimea crisis reflected this same perspective:
"You just dont in the twenty-first
century behave in nineteenth-century fashion by invading another
country on completely trumped-up pretext."
Nuland was present at the creation of the
liberal view. She served for two years in the Moscow embassy, starting in
1991; by 1993 she was chief of staff to Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott.
She directed a study on NATO enlargement for the
Council on Foreign Relations in 1996, and spent three more years at State as
deputy director for Former Soviet Union Affairs.
After a couple of years on the beach at the
Council on Foreign Relations, President George W. Bush named her deputy
ambassador to NATO in Brussels, in 2001. She returned to Brussels in the top
job after her service to Cheney.
When Obama was elected, she cooled her heels as
special envoy to the Talks on Conventional Forces in Europe for two years
until Clinton elevated her to spokesperson. Secretary of State John Kerry
promoted her last year.
It seems fair to say that Putin has trumped
Obama at every turn in the maneuvering over Ukraine - including last week,
when the Russian president concluded a truce with the humbled Ukrainian
president Petro Poroshenko while leaders of the NATO nations fumed
ineffectively at their annual summit, this year in Wales.
Never mind the
Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, China, Israel. Even in Europe, the
presidents foreign policy is in tatters.
Backing away from the liberal view is clearly
going to be costly for some future presidential aspirant. The alternative is
to maintain the expensive fiction of a new Cold War.
