Presentation Transcript
Brian OLeary (BO'L): The next
session of this conference and the theme of today is Crisis and
Opportunity. And I cant think of a more knowledgeable person, a unique
person on the planet, to address those two questions, than George Green,
whom Ive known for about 20 years, I guess? Weve been in
.
George Green (G): Yeah. I guess thats about it.
BO'L: ...the same business and
This guys amazing. I just, you
know, I cant even describe. He used to be a Lapis Pig. [audience
laughter] And he surely is not now. But hes a very smart man. He has a
background in finance, economics. It just goes on and on, his list of
credentials.
And more recently, its just an extraordinary blend because he has his
finger in the pie of the economic situation, his finger in the pie of
the political situation. Hes incredibly active, travels a lot, you
know. He just appeared, ah, kind of like, thats what he does, he makes
an appearance.
And he also has published - through his contacts that hes had through
the years, and being able to open himself up to certain energies that
have very benevolent advice for humanity in what we are to do.
So the books that George has produced:
Handbook for the New Paradigm -
its sold a lot;
Becoming - thats I think my favorite of the four;
Embracing The Rainbow, and
Messages for The Ground Crew, which is his
most recent one.
So, George, youre on!
G: Thank you. Before I go because of the energies and the stuff Im
going to be talking to, I want to get all the dark energies. So, just
kind of close your eyes for a second and demand that all dark energies
leave our space.
[a few moments of silence]
OK. Thats good. Now, I had somebody come up and say: What do I do for
exercising? So Im going to give you all an exercise that you need to
learn, especially the people over age 50.
Voices (Vs): George, can you hold the mic closer?
G: Hold the mic closer? Is this better?
Voices: Yes.
G: Anyway, for all you people who need to exercise, and everybody needs
to exercise a little bit, especially the people over age 50 because
youve kind of slowed down. What I want you to do... this is an easy
exercise, it wont be too hard. You know these five-pound potato sacks?
What you want to do is get two five-pound potato sacks. Hold them out for
about at least one minute. [audience laughter]
G: Well, wait a minute. Thats one minute a day, and you can do that for
about a week. Then were going to graduate. Were going to go up to the
ten-pound ones. Then were going to do the ten-pound ones for about two
weeks. Is that OK? You can hold them out and you can kind of expand at
that time, cause youll get really used to it. After about a month,
youre ready to go to the 25-pound bag.
At the end of the 25-pound bag... You start doing that for about 3 weeks
or so. Then put a potato in it. [audience laughter and applause]
That seems to liven up the day! [continuing laughter]
The basis of my program, or sharing with you, because as you know, I
travel around the world, and people are asking me whats going on. And
since, like he said, I ran around with the so-called Lapis Pigs...
The truth is, theyre not any different than you and I, with the
exception of some of the clones. And I wont go into the cloning
procedures because that always ends up with people getting killed and we
dont need to talk about that. But its a very simple procedure and
weve been doing that since 39, to give you an idea.
The situation were in: Im going to give you some overviews. I think
Brian said it the first time, that you guys all came here by an
airplane.
Let me give you some ideas of what were doing to the planet. This is
just a rough idea. If you get a jet and you just flew in from London? It
takes about 6,000 pounds of fuel to fly the airplane over here. And
theyre all flying between 30,000 and 36,000 feet. Right? Six thousand
pounds [of fuel].
Do you think in your own mind, that thats all being burnt? Well, its
going up in the atmosphere between 30,000 and 36,000 feet, about half of
it. Now remember, 6,000 pounds of fuel. Thats a lot in gallons. Ask the
pilot next time how many gallons that is that were using up of oil.
Well, let me come back to the next thing.
In the United States right now, every hour, we have 5,000 airplanes in
the air. Around the planet, we have over 25,000. So, when you fly around
the planet, and some of you people have, do you ever look at the sky
itself and see the haze? Now, thats between 30,000 and 36,000 feet and
its fairly heavy and its starting to come down on the planet. Now we
have another problem.
Brians not up to date because things are happening so fast. Hes
telling me weve got 6 billion people on the planet. The truth is,
theres approximately 6.8 billion people on the planet. Were increasing
the planets population by 300,000 a day, or 3 million every ten days.
So if you can imagine, in 10 days you have 3 million people and theyre
all coming down to Vilcabamba. [laughter] I dont think so, because most
people will not go within a 10-mile area of where they live.
Most people have about a half a tank of gas in their car. Right? Which
allows them to go about 100 miles. We also had an interesting game to
keep track of this function of traveling around the world and moving
things right now, using an enormous amount of energy.
Now, believe it or not, theres all kinds of
free energy on the planet.
Most of its very expensive and the real problem is the portability of
it. How do we take it so we can travel, or transfer or go to places?
Now, how much energy is used in this house? Look around you. Is that
compared to where it is in the States, for instance? How much more do
you use? Well, this gives you a...
Were here in Ecuador. And Im going to come down to Ecuador in a little
bit because its right at the Equator.
How many of you have been on cruise ships? If you noticed, if you go in
the middle of the cruise ship, theres very little movement back and
forth.
Well, were on planet Earth. Its getting ready to do a lot of movement
back and forth. Over the next three to four years, were going to have
amazing
geophysical changes, earthquakes, movement.
Ive been advised from other sources that you should be above 1,100
feet. I dont care where you are, just for pure safety. And stay away
from the coastline.
I mean this has been a long time ago, as you are well aware, that they
were aware of the population problem, well, with 6.8 billion people on
the planet. And its so severe, the politics of the game - and, Brian,
you know politics is two words? Poli means many, and ticks are
blood-suckers. Right? [laughter]
If you go to Mexico City today, they dont know the population, but its
between 25 and 30 million, mas o menos. [Spanish: more or less] Right?
Half of the population of Mexico City doesnt have sewage, water, or
electricity. Am I right?
Voices: Right. Mm hm.
G: And you have a dividing line. Its between those that have and that
dont have. Its like going to Rio. You go down to Rio Ive been down
there on the beach. You sit down and you go one block over and all of a
sudden, the same problem, because of the economic system of the world.
Now, when I was... ah... they come after me originally because I was
selling money. Probably a lot of you are aware that is my thing... Ah...
The state decided that they had to do something. Well, it wasnt the
state, it was the Federal Reserve that notified the state to get me
licensed.
And of course, Im arguing with the state: The first thing we have to do
is determine, what the hells money? Does anybody know? They dont have
a definition for it! I defy you to find a definition in the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund. Did you know that? There is no
definition of money!
They have a little paragraph that says that its a commodity, basically,
that we use to keep track of the exchange of goods and services. Right?
Well, the inner group that controls all of the worlds money is out of
Switzerland, the
Bank of International Settlements. Now, these
13
families determine what money is really worth because they exchange it
between countries. Right now we have a problem in the United States.
Theres an old saying thats out here right now: Figures dont lie.
Liars figure. [laughter]
The accounting network is kind of like the law profession. You know, they
practice law. Right? Practice law. Its like medical doctors - they
practice medicine.
Its the same thing with all of the... ah... I found out that the more
licenses I got - and I dont want to tell them - they were licenses to
steal. What were doing is taking all of these other people and saying:
Well, Im a professional. You follow me. I know whats right and whats
wrong. But each one of us independently, individually, know whats right
and wrong.
Thats the process that they left out. The leaving out of individual
responsibility: Let somebody else do it for me because I can go back to
sleep and go on.
That was planned a long time ago. In order to keep everybody happy,
well provide you with entertainment, make sure that youre focused on
the Super Bowl, make sure youre focused on whats going on in Hollywood
anything in the world [to distract you] as theyre getting ready for
the end of the world.
Now, to bring you up to date: The Plan 2000s behind schedule, for the
people that are aware of
the Plan 2000. I sat in on the meetings. It
calls for the planned reduction of the worlds population. You know, you
hear a lot of figures - a couple billion. A couple billion is because
40% of the world is today existing on less than $2 a day.
The other problem is, theres no water left. Waters the most critical
thing we have on the planet. Its the most valuable thing on the planet.
So most of the waters being polluted because they dont take care of
it.
Half of the population of the United States is on septic. Did you know
that? And most of the septic is not treated. We have real easy ways of
using enzymes in the septic system which go down and break down all the
fecal matter and have clear water coming out. Instead, its going into
the streams, and the ground waters now all being polluted.
Meanwhile, theyre using all the [pesticides], and all the problems they
have, to get rid of the so-called bugs that were actually helping us.
The
bees are dying, the flies are going. Everything is happening to you,
within the whole system. But its not just us. Its the entire planet.
Ive been, I guess, blessed with being able to run around with the
three-letter agencies the CIA, thats Crooks In Action. [laughter]
I dont know if anybodys CIA. If theres some CIA people, I dont care
if theyre here tonight. Theyre professional liars. Its the truth! All
of them. Look at
Bush. Hes a professional liar. He was CIA. Right? They
actually think that theyre running the world. Its all a game.
And the FBI? They look at them... There was a joke when I was with the
CIA. They said: The FBI, theyre 60 percenters. I said: What do you
mean, sixty percenters? They said: You know, when we take the exam? They
only get 60% on their grades.
The FBI, you know what that is? The Federal Bureau of Investigation?
They have no authority to do anything. Did you know that? They cant
arrest you. They cant do anything. Did you know that?
Voice: No.
G: They have to bring in the local sheriff to do the arresting. Its a
whole game. Its intimidation.
Well, right now were in a position, knowing whats going on with the
planet, and I have it. You know, you can get all the information you
need to at the
World Watch Institute out of Washington, DC, or that type
of [thing]. Theyre being funded by all the think-tanks. Theyre trying
to keep up with whats going on.
Im not going to go into too many more details, because you guys can do
that. What Im interested in is solutions right now.
Voice: Mm hm.
G: Where can you go? Because the whole thing is going to collapse. There
isnt anybody coming out. Theyre talking right now about basically
shutting down the banking system in the United States because of all of
the derivatives, all the other things that are occurring. Chinas got,
you know, about 150-trillion dollars in debt. This is all in the last
year. Its increased. Did you know that?
Voices: No.
G: Well, the money system is so unwise that theyre all using what they
call derivatives, and derivatives are what? They cant even tell you
what they are. And so they tell you: Weve got these derivatives
covered.
Right now, how dumb it is, in the last 6 months or the last year, how
much did the United States give to the banks for rescuing the housing?
Anybody have any ideas?
Voice: Eight and a half trillion.
G: Did you know that the money that was actually put out into the
market, half of the houses - no, theyve put money out there - that
half of the houses that they put the re-loans on are back into
foreclosure. Did you know that?
Voice: No.
G: How are we going to be able to sustain something? Because we have to
have jobs. Meanwhile, the United States is really good. I talked to a
Boeing representative the other day. He said: All we do is assemble our
parts. We get a hundred thousand parts from all parts of the world.
So, what the game is, its all coming apart everywhere. And the other
day I was with some friends who import goods from China and the Chinese
companies over there say: Well be glad to ship them to you, now, but pay
us in any other currency besides the dollar.
Now, what is that telling you? The dollar this last two weeks has done
what? Sunk down to zero percent interest. Now, what is the dollar? Its
money. And whats money? So we kind of have this big Monopoly game.
Somebody else owns the Deed, you guys.
I mean, Ive done all these crazy things. After I found out what was
going on with the
Federal Reserve, I started my own bank outside the
Federal Reserve. I couldnt make any money at it, frankly, because I
didnt have the franchise to create money out of thin air.
Voices: Exactly. Right. [laughter]
G: The Federal Reserve does it every day. The bank, if you join the
syndication called the Federal Reserve - because you have Federal
Reserve banks and everything - theyre allowed to create it. But the
bank I started, and I was authorized to do it, but we had to use dollars
because were part of the system, arent we?
Its kind of like Ecuador right now. The Ecuadorian president, bless his
heart... By the way I went to the University of Illinois too, the same
place where the president did. He studied finance and I studied law and
business. So we, you know. But mine was 30 years before him. [laughs]
Hes 43 years old, isnt he?
Voice: Yes.
G: He has the right ideas. Im trying to have a meeting with him to have
him to try to move some of the currency out of Ecuador so it has some
kind of gold backing. Were working on some of these things. Thatll
give you some currency that you can feel good...
Historically on the planet, historically, I mean thousands of years,
theyve always used gold and silver. Whether or not thats going to be
good or not, who the hell knows? But for the temporary period right now,
its the only thing that we know. I call it a storage of wealth. So
you can move it into there.
I dont care what they do with the game because the whole worlds
currencies are collapsing right now. Putin told the world Putin,
thats some guy over there in what do you call that? Russia?
He told all of the Russians that have dollars to move them into gold
because the United States will be in a massive depression by the end of
this year. This is public knowledge. Did you see the papers?
I was a securities underwriter in the game of stocks. And they always
tell you to put your money into a piece of paper. All youre doing is
trading against each other. It has nothing to do with the company. Once
I issue the stock, you give the company its money, then its trading
between you guys.
Right now, 60% of all stocks are held by what? The pension funds and
mutual funds, which dont have any voting rights. And what have they
told you? Forty percent of that moneys gone. Theyve also said all of
the endowments that were in all the universities, Yale and all the rest
of them, they were all into stocks and theyre all the way down, so they
cant provide any education.
In the United States last year, and this was Hillsdale College
information, there were 6,000 PhDs in the United States that graduated
in engineering. Their calculation is that 90% of the worlds engineers
will be Oriental, living in the Orient.
Meanwhile, the United States has really done a good job of making people
hate us. The United States is becoming the most hated country in the
world.
Meanwhile, the Global 2000 agenda is what? Its to get a war started in
the Middle East which, if you ask me about timing, it could be what
time is it?
Voices: Mm hm.
G: My feelings are, things could go out of hand right now because of
Hamas, and whats happening over there, which is a duly elected
leadership, supposedly. But theyre all setting up on it.
But because the United States is reaching a precipice where the dollar
is worthless and all the money that theyve been advancing, all these
billions, this created money out of thin air, which the obligation
Were all on - get this 90-day Notes. Theyre not ten years from now
- in 90 days theyre due. When was that? Did you notice everything,
what happened to Bush? They moved everything up into Obamas campaign.
Voices: Right. Mm hm.
G: So what has he inherited? He doesnt know whats coming down. I mean,
he can tell me hes going to come out for change. Well, the change thats
going to happen is a total collapse of the system as we know it in the
United States. Theres going to be a banking holiday.
What can you do? Its going to be a challenge to keep ahead because
weve never lived through this situation before.
Now, my guidance: Somebody asked me the question about the handbooks and
where it was. Yes, I got involved with the Plejarans or
the Pleiadians
at first, when I was living with
Billy Meier.
When I was with Billy, questions were asked from them, of the
extraterrestrials. I says, you know: Whos above you? They said theyre
in constant communion with Spirit. That was their answer...
Well, my agreement was to assist in getting the information out, subject
to some legal things with Billy.
Well, when I was in Vegas, youll know that story. When I got down there,
I was asked to build an enemy prisoner of war camp in downtown Las
Vegas, right on I-15. An enemy prisoner of war camp. I put a copy of the
contract in one of my books, Chaos in America, so you could see what was
happening. It was built, by the way. I didnt build it.
Within another week or two I got another book and in it, the ET... wed
done it before but I reassembled it... and it was called The Spiritual
Laws. That was basically connected with some of the other entities on
another level within our books.
Then all of a sudden, I got notification - at that point it was
telepathically. They said: Hey! They reminded me of my agreement that I
had in Switzerland, but they said: We could not transmit the information
clearly because theres so much negative energy in Las Vegas.
So, I had to, you know, get out of Dodge, if you want to go ahead. When
I made the agreement in Switzerland with them, I said: Im going to go
ahead and do this.
You know, when I came back to LA - we were talking about this before,
to get this thing squared away with Billy - my attorneys over there
thought I was a nut. But I said: Hey, youve got my word. If my words
no good, nothing is. I mean, you dont sign contracts with
extraterrestrials, do you? You ARE one! You know? [laughs]
Anyway, when I got involved with this thing, all of a sudden Im
receiving the information, I looked around for a place that I considered
safe, knowing whats planned for us.
And I looked at
Four Corners in Colorado. I like the west better than I
do the east part of the United States. So I looked at the Four Corners
area and I looked...
Anyway, I ended up in Coeur dAlene, Idaho because they had plenty of
water. Close to the Canadian border in case I needed to get out of
Dodge, you know, that kind of thing. I ended up doing that. When I got
up there, then all of a sudden I started receiving the information.
Now, the source of the information, and this is very humbling to me, is
at the Creational level, not only of this universe but others. We are so
out of balance on this planet with negative energies that were
affecting our neighbors. This thought is permeating through the whole
universe since we are all part of the thought of the Creation - all of
us.
Anyway, then there was the agreement. How can you do that when the
creation to do it identified even the author? Because the history of the
planet - were looking for somebody to save us, so we deify or crucify
the messenger.
Im not that. Im the publisher for the information given to me from
them, the ETs. OK? [laughter] I admit to being in contact. I didnt
write that stuff. In fact, I joked with them. I says: If Im going to do
this... Do you know why thats on the back page? They did it! I put it
together.
When I first agreed to do this it was like sitting with you guys, only
there was only like ten of us. They were extraterrestrials, physical
just like you and I. I said: The book has to be less than 200 pages
because people dont read any farther than that. And they want to put it
in their pocket, so you can put it in your pocket and read it any time
you want to. These are all the conditions.
Guess what? Thats exactly the way they gave it down. So all of a
sudden, theyre going right along and then finally, we got through the
last books and they come up with a message: Thats the mental re-assortment. And thats the end of the messages.
I still get information, but they say that basically theres enough
there to trigger those people to be awakened at the proper time in the
future.
Now, you may not totally understand them at this point. All thats done
now is, like, what were looking at is triggering the computer, the
computer within, on the Soul. Thats all we are.
This Rent-a-Wreck [laughter] has the information in there now on the
Soul level because it knows everything, too, to start triggering the
body to be receptive to the creation as the creation is looking at this
experiment, if you want to call it, to give us the answers and the
solutions which will be coming down for the survival of a number of the
people on the planet, which requires then what?
-
The responsibility of you to understand the situation.
-
The
responsibility of you to challenge the information that I put out, to
find that out for yourself.
-
And then ask for guidance yourself because
when you
read these books, youre
going to start thinking different.
How many of you have been reading these books and thinking different?
Yes, its amazing, isnt it? Youre not the same person. We cant go
back, either.
Unfortunately, once you wake up to this whole game of life that we have
right now, the unfortunate problem is that the whole worlds coming
down. And out of the chaos theres going to be enormous chaos were
going to have to work together to basically facilitate other people who
will be coming to you for the information, to create something new.
We will be assisted to get all the free energy when we come into
spiritual balance. Now, when Brian was talking a little back, if you go
back to the four laws of the universe, thats exactly what hes talking
about.
The
Law of Attraction - what you put out, youre
going to get back. What
is your thought? The Law of Attention is the second law. What did you
intend for your thought? Well, our training since kids was all of the
education that the bad guys gave us and its probably 100% wrong. But we
believed it. Right? Belief systems. Right? Belief Systems. Whats the
first letter of those two words?
Voice: BS.
G: You got it. And another word, Brian, when he used the word ego? You
know what ego really stands for? Edging God Out. [laughter] And what is
the god? The god within. Because youre all powerful. Were all of us,
were all powerful. Together we just have to... were all here for an
understanding to wake up on how to have a solution and get prepared for
whats coming down.
Im glad that you came down here at this point, so we at least start the
action. The starting is: How do we set up community within communities?
I picked Ecuador from running around the world at this point because
politically its more stable. Even though the President doesnt know
everything, he knows enough that he wants to protect his people. Were
happy about that.
Ecuador is pretty much middle class for the most part, if you look at
it, compared to a lot of it. And theyre so friendly. Theyre willing to
help you out.
Ninety percent of the worlds plants are over here. Did you know that?
90% - somewhere. Ecuador is the largest exporter of roses. You go to any
place in the United States and get roses and they came from Ecuador. All
the florists. Am I right?
They have a lot of other possibilities here because the things that are
available for us to keep within our community and within the country
itself and other items to export while we can.
Now, how quick is this coming down? Frankly I think theyre going to begin
World War III by the second quarter of this year. Now, this is all
planet stuff. The information that theyre observing and telling me,
cause theyre monitoring whats going on right now between us, but
theyre also doing the entire planet. Theyre expecting that the war
thats going to get started, which will go on in the Middle East as planned
by the guys for population reduction, will last for about four years, a
little over four years, I think.
The exact timing or day its going to happen, I dont know, but its coming
up pretty fast. I try to keep ahead of all this stuff with all my
people.
I couldnt believe it that two days ago I was asked to help convert a
government bond for Venezuela. Now, it was seven billion dollars. You
have it, like we issue US Bonds? You know, you can buy the $100 bond
where they tried to give them away?
Let me give you some simple things to look at. They asked me to do this.
So I said... Seven million dollars. How do you convert a bond? You go to
your local bank. Right? Well, they dont have any money either.
So I called my friends who had the money and I says: Ive got this bond.
And they said: Well, bring it on to the Board. I said: Well, they told
me theyd advance $500-million on it instantly. Five hundred million.
Can you even imagine?
Yesterday when I come down here I got word their Board decided not to do
it because of the political nature - not a question, was the bond bad
- the whole country of Venezuela guaranteed the bond. So what do you
do?
Now, in the United States, theyre trying to convince you to go buy
student bonds and everything else.
How many people in here know the bankers Rule of 72? Now, Im a
banker first of all. Just to give you an idea, Im going to tell you what
the problems are.
As a banker, you always look at what they call returns. Im going to
give you the flat rule. We call it the pig end of the world. Whatever
interest rate that you get, i.e., you divide the interest rate that you
get into 72 and that will tell you how long it takes to double your
money.
So if you put money at work at 7% into an investment and they promised
you a 7% return, itll double in ten years. So if I got a 10% return,
itll double in seven.
Well, I was involved with a lot of underwriting on pension funds.
Pension funds in the United States, are required
The figure they
calculated was an 8.3% return. Well, how do you invest something at 8.3%
when General Motors only makes if they were making money - were doing
about 1% or 2%. Right? And now all the corporation bosses are stealing
all the money anyways, so theres nothing like that.
So whats happening is that
The point that they left out. When I sat in
with State, I said: Weve got to change this, I said, the rules. Because
it isnt a question of either backing or doubling your money; but
because inflation is going at least 7%, whats your money worth in ten
years? Zippo.
And if you bought a life insurance plan, like New York Life or
Equitable, and all that which they tell you to buy and start annuities,
they can give a 2.5% return when held to maturity. In other words, it
builds up, accumulation at the cash end, and the maturity date of a life
insurance plan is age 96. [laughter]
And as you keep putting money into the plan, they keep giving you less
and less insurance because its a combination of the cash that you have
in the policy, plus the equity on top. Am I explaining this to you?
Voice: Term insurance.
G: So all there is, is term insurance. So then I started analyzing the
actuary tables on the term insurance, the life insurance expectancy, and
thats all they buy. So the insurance companies are in business to make
money. They dont even have to have reserves for two years. Did you know
that? Its such a game. And now weve got the government setting down
here
You hear about AIG which covers a lot of stuff on it? The
government just bailed them all out.
So what has happened, youve got the government, which is supposedly all
the peoples assets, which they dont know, is like all the real
property in the United States to them and all the industry.
So now what do we have? Its a position now: Where do I go where I can
live with very little energy? Your house. Right? Thats it. We can grow
food. Our neighbors will
Im going around the world to try to set up sustainability and work on
the energy and ask for assistance from other levels in order to come
down to assist the planet thats going to be left. Because theyre going
to go
ahead with their plan. Obviously, when you travel around the world, too
many people dont have enough money to live. You see too many. And it
shouldnt be that way.
Yesterday when I was in Quito, I was with a friend of mine who got a
check from the church. We went over to the bank. They were going to cash
it. They couldnt even cash the churchs check because there wasnt
enough money in the account.
Theres so much lack of circulation of everything right now and because
of whats going on in the automobile business - I brought it with me.
Ill show you later. I was just in Reno and in San Jose. I did a deal.
Chrysler-Deimler is out there offering Chryslers, brand new Chryslers,
at 50% off. Did you see the ad?
And this is the other thing Ive noticed
of course Ive been saying
this for some time. Why are all the companies at the end of the year
over Christmas giving away product? Their products they were giving
them away at less than what it cost them. You know why?
Because like when K-Mart merged with Sears, they were both in
bankruptcy. They got all the derivative money and they have to pay the
interest on it. And the interest is all due this month. They didnt get
enough sales on things so they gave away merchandise that they got and
they still owe money to the people who are the suppliers of their
merchandise.
Meanwhile, Wal-Mart is real interesting because
this is also an
interesting fact for you. I use the word interesting a lot, but... Its
interesting that the Wal-Mart people have the largest computers in the
world keeping track of commerce. Did you know that?
Theyre the largest supplier, they know exactly what youre going to need,
exactly what youre going to do. And they have all these computer things.
And their computer is down, of course, in Arkansas and its three
stories above ground. What you dont know is theres two stories
underneath their network, totally underneath, which is the backup for
the United States military.
Voices: [comments] Really!
G: To keep track of everybody. So when you get all the new merchandise
that you get, itll have a little chip in it which is all run down by
who? Which is also run down and controlled by? Whos the backup on it?
Do you understand whats happening?
So were going to be set down and mobilized
And I talked to some people
about this. I said: My gosh, youre really set for doing the
mobilization.
And people are going to stand in line to go get their new card when they
shut the banks down, which is planned. And that could happen any time
now, I would think,
after Obama gets in, frankly, after the first 90
days, because when they do that
The economys just the distribution of
money. So then theres going to be a bank holiday for a while.
So we have this little window. And Ill know more about that in the next
week or two because my guys, for instance in Panama which
Thats all
they deal with is money. Theyre holding everything in dollars at this
minute. Switzerland wont take the dollars anymore.
I mean, what do you do with a currency thats worthless? What do you do
with a country thats bankrupt and lies? And yet were willing to go
ahead and drop nuclear bombs on somebody else. Were the only country
thats got nuclear bombs. Think about it.
Voices: [comments] Israel or Syria?
G: Well the Syrian thing, when they dropped the two
Theyre using
bunker buster bombs right now. Thats what they did. But Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, where did those bombs come from? Do you know?
Voice: Hitler?
G: Thats right. The answer was Hitler. The Germans already had it. In
fact, at the end of World War II, we took the nuclear submarine right
out of the chute. I have documents that Germany was selling enriched
uranium to the Japanese in 1938. So you dont know all of the things
that are going on behind the scenes.
This is just kind of an overview. Were in a big world mess. There is
abundant free energy. But the trouble is affordability. I was talking to
a couple of people that are putting a new device out, about this big.
Have you seen all the new solar battery rechargers? Well because of the
new diode lights - youve seen those little tiny ones? Well theyre
putting them in little packets. You can do this yourself.
Get those, you know, those Christmas tree lights? Well, you put more
than one together, get one of those solar rechargers, put in the battery
- get one of the new long-life batteries in there - and those will
activate those little lights and you can put them in a cluster. Youll
have enough to light up this room.
So what you need, then, is the light that will come into the room at
nighttime. Thats when you need it. During the daytime all its doing is
recharging. So you can have light perpetually if you need it and thats
essentially as close as we can come with the technology we have thats
available that you can make yourself.
Youve all seen them. Youve seen the little lights. They come around and
tell you. You have this emergency light. You wind it up. It has a little
light. Thats those little diodes. The thing is that theyre all made in
China.
The United States has got a problem with bullets for some reason. We
dont make them anymore. We import them from other countries. [laughter]
Theyre also putting in some new
Right now theres new laws coming into
the United States for registration. Theyre trying to do what they can
for gun control. Thats really for identifying them.
I had some friends who were involved with the militia movement, which is
constitutional, but nobodys going to do anything. Because why? Half of the
population of the United States is over 50. Did you know that? Half!
One out of three people in the United States work for the government.
What do they make? One out of three people work for companies that
contract back to the government.
So Im keeping it down to what I call the narrow workforce. Legitimately
were in a problem where you and I could create something someplace else
that will make sense based on basically global trading, if you want to
look at it, or trade with a neighbor. Because thats what were going to
have to go back to. It isnt the money in your pocket.
And now they have this new
Youre all seen the new dollar that the
United States has put out, havent you? The new one? The coin?
Voice: The little coin?
G: I have some with me. They make them down here too. They print
them. The
Euros are OK except for Germany just announced that theyre not going to
take the Euros that are coming from Spain or France, and Italy - I
guess its Spain and Italy - because they dont think their moneys any
good anymore.
Voice: Greece also.
G: And Greece also. Well that means, hey, you can go ahead and print a
Euro, theyre not going to take it. Now theyre separating the Euros
between themselves. [laughter] So now if you buy Euros from
Do you
understand the complications that were involved in?
Im trying to get some stabilization for all of you because I love all
of you. Youre part of me. Were all together. And if were not
together, we have something wrong as soon as we start looking at
differences and divisions between each other.
I dont care. As the ETs say, 'this is the human race.
You may be all
different colors, but this planet is the humans. Theres only one race
and thats all there is. Thats us.
Well were all part of the same connection because this planet happens
unfortunately, its a prison planet.
Theres many planets out here
inhabited with humans. Humans.
But were a mess! So what we need to do is create this system were
talking about, on helping people to assist themselves to wake up. But
they dont know who they are. They dont know that they have a soul
inside that weighs - how many grams?
Voice: 21 or 22.
G: 22 grams. You know, four packs of sugar, thats about the size of it
its actual weight, based on the hydrogen. Its a connection.
And it takes 3 days for the soul energy to pull off the body. Why do you
think most indigenous people keep the body away for about three days?
And heres the no-no - and the ETs are monitoring this big time:
Nuclear energy will disrupt the soul. Imagine combining that energy back
again.
Remember, the soul is the memory of all of your lifetimes. All of them.
You may or may not know that you have a past life. The feelings that you
have, what youre doing, the type of work youre doing, the family that
you selected. You selected your parents. Can you believe that? That will
be for lessons that you have to learn on a soul level.
Unfortunately, the way things are set up, you come into what they call
the Veil of Forgetfulness. You forget who and what you are. A lot of
babies are coming through that remember who and what they are and
theyre programmed not to do that: You cant see people. You cant see
other ones, and little kids. Thats a lie. So theyre programmed not to
understand other dimensions.
We are
working simultaneously - thats simultaneously in many
dimensions - at this minute. We are being reflected, not only in this
hologram
I call it, and youve all heard me say that before, this
hologram of this Rent-a-Wreck which we come back to whether
They said
the light condensed or vibration of different elements.
But the real basis, if you look at it all, theres nothing there but a
series of protons and electrons spinning so fast they appear to be
solid. Its an appearance.
Voices: Mm hm. Yeah.
G: Its amazing what weve created - the appearance that we have, based
on the DNA programming that we put in through appearance. We selected
it, but were being bombarded with what? Radiation from everywhere.
How many people in here have
cell phones? Thats interesting. A question
I have is, would you put your head in a microwave oven? All cell phones
are based on microwaves. When you put the cell phone tower up, thats
sending out the microwaves. I think, Brian, you mentioned that you have
one up here in order to get the information thats going to... Its going
through all of us.
But what has happened with the cell phones - and the scientists are all
proving this right now - when you put it up next to your head, youre a
receptor.
Remember, your hearing goes into little areas in your brain right here.
It converts the audible sound back into signals that go into your mind,
which you are translating those thoughts back into what you reasonably
think is a word or whatevers going to happen. When you take a cell phone
and put it next to it, youre burning it up!
So the best thing you can do with a cell phone is get a remote thing
that you put on it. You can get
[audience member holds up device] Not
Shes showing me the new stickers theyve put on the top of it and said
thats going to do it. Thats not really... They dont help.
You need to have one of the remote earphones on it or
I use a speaker
phone so its held away from me. You know, its the devil if you do, the
devil if you dont. A lot of people are
My buddy who was making those
things for a while, we were doing experiments with them. It doesnt do
anything. Thats not next to your ear. The radiation...
Voice: MyoPhone?
G: It doesnt do it. I sat down with
Are you all familiar with
John Bedini?
Voices: Yes. No. [comments]
G: Bedinis kind of a
he looks like
Nicola Tesla. Hes a brain within
the area of this stuff and hes got all kinds of
I mean, I counted 50
motors in there that are working all the time. Hes creating with magnetics. Hes kind of the father of the free energy stuff.
We started working on all these devices. It doesnt do that. Because,
remember youre holding it up to your head
Hows that going to stop the
transmission of it going into your head?
Voice: It must be a diffuser.
G: Its not. Otherwise, you wouldnt be able to hear.
Voice: Its a diffuser.
G: Yeah.
When you go on the airplane right now, what do they tell you? Turn your
cell phone on? Turn it off. Do you know it has nothing to do with the
airplane? This is a part of the lie.
Let me explain that to you. All of a sudden out of thin air they come up
with the deal when you get aboard an airplane, its going to affect the
pilot? Its a different frequency, a totally different range than they
use on the cell phones anyway.
The second thing is I just got through telling you that its a microwave
tower thats transmitting. It transmits through the ground. Right? So
when you go in the air anyway it doesnt work. But the reason behind the
lie that theyre representing to you is what? The 9/11 myth.
Voice: Right, George. [comments]
G: Thats right. The 9/11 myth was all the people who said: I got on my
cell phone and all this and we talked to the ground.
Voice: Right.
G: There was none of that. They were creating a huge movie and youre
all following along with the program.
Voice: I dont understand that. Explain that again?
G: On
9/11 there were supposedly people aboard the planes, the hijack
thing, that used their cell phones?
Voice: Yeah
Oh
G: They dont work in the air. Unless you have a
Ill clarify that.
Most cell phones dont do it. There are some that work off satellites.
But that didnt happen.
But anyway, its another way to get you marching to the tune to be more
controlled. And youre going to be doing this more control as it comes
up because everywhere across the United States right now water is being
rationed.
In Las Vegas they asked me
they pay me to take up grass. They want to
go back with the natural. The casinos have all that beautiful water.
They truck it in. It comes in from Canada.
Voice: Theyre rationing the rainwater.
G: Theyre rationing
Well, the overall aquifer would provide
its
going down so fast, that provides water for Denver, Colorado, for
instance. The Denver water supply is way down. New Mexico is about out.
My friends down there say its the biggest drought they could look at.
So water has to be the most critical thing on the planet right now for
survival, because all the water has been reprocessed and it becomes dead
water. Its dead water that youre drinking, basically, in Los Angeles,
or any of the big cities. So for some advice I can tell you?
Voice: [comment]
G: Yeah. Get out of town. And the plastic bottles? Theyre another
problem.
Voice: Molecules.
G: Yeah. We have a lot of molecules that are being addressed when you
take that into it. But again we have a problem with it. What is the
solution to that? Because how do you make water portable? Well, they
like to do it because they make so much money doing it.
I have a friend right here that has a bottling plant. Do you know him? A
million bottles a month of water. And then the next thing is economics.
How do you get it out of the water, put it into someplace where its
transferable?
All of these things, if you look at it
Oil, by the way, according to my
son whos a senior engineer with Bechtel, should be at least $80 a
barrel in order to cover the economics of the system right now, which
then totally diffuses all the other systems because it costs more money
to produce it, i.e., to provide the energy that they have.
And up in Canada right now, as you know, theyre laying off the people
out there on the tar sands, or the oil sands, digging down, because it
costs more in energy to get the oil out of the sand. What its doing is
providing economy while people are getting rich. But theyre being laid
off in Calgary, Edmonton and everywhere else. Its a global meltdown.
Its just everywhere.
So if everybodys going to be out of a job and moneys not going to be any
good, whats going to be the most valuable thing? Water. And whats the
next one?
Voice: Food.
G: And from the future I want you to remember this: The future now is
going to be a situation of needs, not wants.
And right now is the situation that
If you look at your appliances
around your house, because we have to use whats given to us, if youve
got 10-year-old appliances, go out and get new ones now. Because the
lifespan of all of that stuff is going to be coming down and there wont be
any distribution of those. So bring yourself up to date. Thats all Im
saying.
Ecuador actually builds Chevrolets. Did you know that? They build
trucks. Brazil has a big Ford plant down there. Its all, almost 100%
automated. So what were doing is looking at Latin America will be the
trading partners for everything if we can come into some function.
But weve got another thing that controls a lot of things: Unfortunately
theres three currencies in the world today, right now. Right? Oil.
Voice: Drugs.
G: Well, drugs is the last one.
Voice: Gold.
G: And gold. Thats the only currencies that are recognized in the
world. The real estate, that illusion of equity, has always been based
on the ability of being able to borrow money against some of it. Well,
therell be no money out here to loan on it.
Have you ever tried to qualify today? Theyre coming back
If you buy a
house, the lenders are coming
This is their requirements. They are
coming into and reappraising your house based on the other average sales
that theyve had around. So if you agree to buy it for $100,000 but they
find everything else at $60,000, they will loan 80% of the $60,000 but
you have to come up with the cash difference, and you cant borrow the
cash difference. So whats that going to do to the real estate market?
Voice: Sink it even further.
G: Well, another problem that I didnt tell you
Theres another
When I
had a bankers meeting a few weeks ago, we were discussing the next wave
of foreclosures and thats all the adjustable rate mortgages that are
coming due this next two years. And theres another trillion dollars
worth of those and theres going to be over 6 million foreclosures in
the United States alone.
And theyre already offering
well, theyre offering houses in Detroit
right now for a dollar, or 100 dollars. Did you know that?
Voices: Mm hm.
G: Youre aware of that too? Yeah. Well, its not only Detroit. Many
cities. All over the place. Well big deal. They want somebody to be able
to take care of them because now theyre finding out theyre empty, that
people are coming in and destroying them.
Now, I used to build properties. I built in 22 states. For a while I was
building low income housing, getting involved in trying to help the
people to come up. I would give them 100% financing. I carried the paper.
But these people had no incentive to keep the property up, even though
they put no money down.
I had one couple. I always remember this because they were such a neat
couple. They had two little kids; they didnt have any money. I sold
them a house for $6,000. And all they had to do was make a $60/month
payment to me. Is that OK?
After a year they decided because I was rich, that they should just have
the house. And I said: Wait a minute. Well, thats actually the
philosophy of a lot of them. So I couldnt do that. I went through the
legal system and booted them out. They totally destroyed the house. So I
took a bulldozer and bulldozed it over.
You see, you cant help people until theyre educated so they have
responsibility. Even though they say ownership will make you more
responsible, if they give them to them with nothing down, what
responsibility do they have? They dont, do they? So what do you thinks
going to go on when they take zero down?
Actually, in Vegas they were loaning at 130%. Did you know that? You
bought the house at 100%, you were contacted within 6 months saying
well loan you 30% so you can pay off your credit card bills. Within 6
months the people had the credit card bill back up. They now owed
$130,000. The why for that was tax reasons. You can write off 100% of
the interest on your home.
You cant write off your interest on your
credit cards.
Voice: George, whens the credit card meltdown?
G: Frankly, Im a little scared about that. I was with the bankers
again. We were discussing what happened. Verizon has the cable carriers
that control all the MasterCard, Visas and stuff? They shut down for
four days about two months ago in the United States, the whole western
United States, so they couldnt process them. You could process it, but
they held out all their computer bases so they could, you know, transfer
it to the banks.
So you ask me when its going to shut down?
There are some war materials
that are set up right now that they can put a pulse across the United
States and shut down all electrical systems and all computers.
Voices: Yeah. Mm hm.
G: All done by satellite. Instantly we will no longer have any
communication whatsoever. Instantly! Well, without any communication,
then Id have to throw away this mic. Right?
Its simple. We have to look at: How do we get hold of our neighbor?
Well go back, I guess, whistle, or do something.
Voices: [comments]
G: These are things that we have to address in the future, and thats
basically saying: OK. Im not going to have the cell phone, even though in
this country now this is basically
The cell phone is the only way
youre going to have it. Most countries are doing that, which is helping
the distribution of everything, but we have another problem.
The system, the movies and everything have set up this greed thing: Ive
got to have a ten million dollar house like that. Well, how do you do
that? The final four laws - There has to be some balance. Wheres the
balance in everything?
ETs are telling me that their conveyance systems, they usually use a
mass transit type thing and the vehicles themselves last 100 years. How
long do our vehicles last?
Voices: [various comments]
G: Well if you stay off the street so you dont get hit. You understand?
Its the traffic that we have to look at. Oh, by the way in California,
the word traffic does not exist. Traffic connotes movement. Right?
Voices: Right. [laughter]
G: Well in any major city right now you have the same problem. All of a
sudden were consuming all this fuel thats spilling... I didnt talk
about the automobiles and what theyre spilling into the air. So were
getting it all.
And by the way, are you breathing in deeply? How does the air feel to
you here?
Voices: Lovely. Great. Wonderful.
G: I mean you may be at a higher elevation and you get used to that in
about a week or so. I built at this Colorado Mountain College, in
Leadville. Thats at 10,000 feet. Right? I built all the dorms up there.
You know, it was some time ago. But even builders were building above
10,000 feet. So its a little hard to adjust to that, but right now
after a week or two you get used to it. But arent you getting clean
air?
Voices: Mm hm. Yeah.
G: Why? They have a limited population. We have
look outside, all the
things that make here. Right?
Now what else is killing things is the lack of
The bees are dying in
the United States.
Voices: [comments]
G: Are you aware of that?
Voices: Yeah.
Colony collapse.
G: And what do bees do? They pollinate everything. So theyre trying to
figure out ways to mass pollinate everything or get things done. And the
beehives now, believe it or not, are worth $100,000.
Voices: Wow. What?
G: A beehive is worth $100,000. Theyre taking them around the place,
they set them down, they rent them out and they put them to work
pollinating. And remember, pollination only goes for a couple weeks.
Right? Am I telling you all the correct things? Well, we have to look at
it and we can do that.
And then theres another thing. Lets go back to frequency for a second.
The plants bloom and pollinate and they do all these things in season,
but theyre assisted too by sound. When the birds are starting to come
in, they come in and they start chirping away. All of a sudden theres
sound, they start growing.
You know, Carlson up in Minnesota developed the Sonic Bloom. Now what is
Sonic Bloom? He took the same information, put it on electronic tape,
you put it on your fence or whatever you have, and the plants responded
to that thought or that information and accelerated the growth. We have
to do that same thing, is what Im telling you.
Tompkins found out that he could go down in the field
he loved his
plants. Remember this? If he loved his plants, they would grow because
their frequency
.
Theres a group of ETs who were in South America and I got involved with
them. They were plants.
Voice: They were what?
G: Plants. [laughter] Well, people that eat. What do you call it? When
you have something that instead of blood you have chlorophyll? What is
that?
Voice: Plants.
G: Anyway they were there to see if they could live on this planet.
Because of the symbiosis, they would take our poison and give us oxygen.
Voice: [comment]
G: I dont care what they look like, theyre my relatives! [laughter]
Well, when I got there were talking about cancer again and how one of
my friends helped me out on that. The contact down there, their
grandmother was dying of cancer and they asked for some assistance from
the ETs. And they looked at her and said: Yeah we got it and well help
you in this case.
So what they did is they gave them a
salve. Youve seen different types
of salve? Well the salve that they gave them down there went into the
palm of your hands. Thats where your energies are going out, that and
the bottom of your feet, believe it or not, on both sides. They
understand all of this. They know how it works.
So anyway, you put it in there. It was absorbed into the body. About
three days later, a scab formed. Pulled off the scab, and the cancer was
all gone. It was natural.
I got a sample of it. I flew the salve itself to Kennecott Laboratories
in Boulder, Colorado, and in three days we did the spectrographic
analysis on it. As Brian will tell you, when you do the spectrographic
analysis on it - it was like a little ball about the size of a pea and
it was
Well, it dissolves. You dissolve the substance and then you do
the spectrum. Because you have to shoot light through it.
I have all that. Well, at that time I flew the results of that
because
at that time I was talking to
Allen Hynek. Some of you know him, and
some of you dont. He was supposedly the government liaison for
investigating UFO stuff. Anyway, I flew all the stuff down to him. He
was in Phoenix, or at a place in Scottsdale, at that time and thats
when I found out he was also CIA.
Voice: Mm hm.
G: Anyway, I was just trying to help. I still have the analysis I gave
him. Fortunately Ive got the original one. I gave copies to him. Well
we dont have anything to match it.
When I went to school, we used to play around with, you know, the
evolving GroupNet stuff. Were just not ready for it.
Now the ETs say theyll assist us. They will not do it for us. Theyll
give us the knowledge to help clean up the planet when we come into, as
Brian said, spiritual balance again.
How do we awaken the spirit? Thats basically the four books that we
have. The four books: the Handbook and Embracing the Rainbow;
Becoming
And getting with other people to communicate and understand the
energies, that were interconnected.
OK. A lot of questions have been asked about whats going on right now.
I want to share how
Big Brothers doing and for a little while Ill
discuss a little bit about that.
And business as we know it is kind of going down the tubes. The internet
is changing everything. People are asking about this. The government in
their wise area looked at, theres so much business on the internet,
they want to start working on that.
And theyve also set up another new system. Everybody that has
MasterCard and Visa? As a consumer youre OK, but if youre a business
and youre using it, youll be getting, and soon, by the banks that
issue your cards, 1099s. This will begin this year.
Voices: What? [comments]
G: Anybody that has for instance, was selling their stuff on eBay?
Voice: Oh
G: On Google, on anything on the internet or you use them, like on
PayPal?
Voices: Mm hm.
G: All transfers of money that will go to an individual will now be
recorded back to the government and youll have 1099s. Thats a tax
statement that shows the income that you had. Because theres a lot of
money thats been transferred.
Now I have a state senator thats a friend of mine and I go with him and
we had a discussion few weeks ago and he said in six months and that
was the date he put on it he said in the United States people will not
recognize the dollar.
Voice: Why?
G: Well, you have to contingently plan on all these things occurring and
we dont know the exact timing but thats why Ive been telling you
again and again. I have senator friends and banker friends and
intelligence people and they are all playing games because its going so
fast right now.
I know youre all here because youre interested in what I have to say,
but as well as a place. I like Ecuador. You can reasonably live here,
compared to other countries. You do have water. You have food. And you
have a bunch of people, in fact theyre all around here, you have to
admit everybody here is good. Dont you feel good about everybody?
Voices: Yeah. [comments / laughter]
G: Well its the same people that will be watching this program right
now. Theyll sit in their living room and say: Wait a minute.
I have all these people that showed up from all over the world. Well,
its telling us two things. You, yourself, are concerned. The whole
world is concerned at some level except for those people that have been
programmed not to think. Most people dont think anymore. Theyre just
being led to slaughter.
I shared with you before, my father was in the meatpacking business and
owned a slaughterhouse. And as a kid, and I had four brothers and our
job, to save money for Dad, was wed go out and work in the
slaughterhouse.
And I found out the most stupid animal in the world were sheep.
Remember, they tell people theyre sheep? When I would go and get a load
of sheep and bring it up the chute for slaughter, they were so dumb they
would jump over the chute to get up with the ones that were going to get
killed.
Did you know that?
Voice: Wow.
G: Guess what? The American people are in that same situation right now.
They have no idea. They say: The government cant be that bad. Well,
its worse. So we have to understand.
See, its all in these position [papers] what theyre planning - and
thats not good news. But we have to understand there is a reason behind
all of it. And even you will have to realize that theres some logic. We
cant keep feeding all the people.
And nobody will listen to the rule book in order to change it. We keep
propagating by fun. Weve made sex a sport act rather than the
responsibility in the creation of a new human being. And we have them
when theyre just
They dont even care. Theyre disposable beings as
they come out.
So societys mental thing has to change for the future, frankly. And
thats what were looking at at this minute.
We also have to work
Like, this is what I call an assortment of
different people. We all have to get together. What if you all got
together in some little community yourself, just the way you are, and
now we sit down and we assign jobs to each person by their talent
Voice: Right.
G:
in order to assist putting together something. And its a group
thing. Its not an individual. We have a collective group of people. Id
prefer to have a scientist up on top to look at it because you have to
remember to follow the four rules in the Handbook.
What you put together, the intent of it, you have to allow the intent to
manifest itself. Thats the allowance.
The end result of all that has to be in balance with nature and with the
surroundings. And this is going to be a hard job. And the ego situation and
the greed thing has to be taken out of the picture because youre not
going to have money to play with anyway. And it isnt: My house is
bigger than yours.
Remember,
the Handbook comes out and says basically that man was meant
to live in abundance, not luxury, because by using luxury, youve taken
away somebody else around the planet.
How many people in here have been to Haiti? Well, if youve been to Port
au Prince and youve gone out and seen all that stuff, these people are
living on less than a dollar a day.
When I flew with the Vice-President of Hanes Corporation, we went down
to Costa Rica, and hes discussing shutting down all his plants that
make all, you know, the underwear. And I said: Where are you going with
them? And he said: Were moving them to Haiti.
Why? Whats the definition of people? Human Resource. So, the bottom
line, the Human Resource is the part of the thing youre looking at.
Does it make any sense to you? Im trying to
Voice: Oh yeah.
G: Logically. Everything is logical. As the ETs had told me a long time
ago: We may be mysterious, dont make it mystical.
The universe is logical, so youve got to work the logic and say: Whats
going on? Look at it, identify it, and say: Weve got plenty of free
energy. Whats running this planet? The Sun.
Voice: Mm hm.
G: And its manifest in everything there is. Its the conversion back
that will not affect society as a rule in order to keep things going.
Well, Im totally aware of what theyre going to do, reducing the
population down.
I mean, you know, 20 million Americans. This is what were talking about
being left of this whole thing. None of you. Nobody in the major cities.
I cant tell you about the rest of the world.
But I can tell you the whole economic thing is coming down in spades. I
was just talking to somebody at lunch and they were talking about buying
a bond in, was it the UK? And in four months it lost 30 percent of its
value. Thirty percent! He thought he was safe, you know, in preserving
his money.
So Im telling you. Historically
Im telling people that at this minute
the only thing that makes any sense on a world basis is having the base
metals and thats your gold and silver. So acquire some. If you can do
it, do it without anybody knowing it.
In the States they got everything - these little pins and everything
else going into your clothes you buy, everything else, so theyre going
to be all monitored and run through the little computers down in, like I
was telling you, that the government has.
So we know that theyre going to keep track of things. Now the next
question is
V1: Wait, wait. What? Pins in your clothes? I dont understand.
G: They all have identification so they can just wave it over [the
checkout scanner] and find out what kind of clothes you are [buying] and
what the prices are.
Another Voice: RFIDs.
G: Yeah, RFIDs. Theyre going to chips.
V1: What was
RFIDs?
G: R-F-I-D. These are
Another Voice: Radio Frequency Identification chips.
Voice: Device.
V1: What is that?
G: Its in almost every product in the United States, even the soaps and
ah
If you notice, in the last four months in the United States, if you
go buy any Kelloggs products, for instance, the boxes may be the same
but theres twenty percent less product that are in it. The soap sizes
are down, you know, one percent more.
Voice: Right. Mm hm.
G: Youve got all of these things that are occurring on it, that
everything is going up in price without you being aware of it. And all
of a sudden youre going to be sitting here: Oh my God, you know, I
bought all this stuff... Which is basically making your dollar worth
less anyway, so its worth-less. Worthless!
Voice: Wow.
G: Yeah. Making sense to you? Thats what Im trying to do. Now, how many
of you people enjoy Ecuador, as youve been here so far? Anybody dont
like it?
Voices: No. [laughter, audience comment]
G: So thats giving us an idea, at least we found out: Why am I here?
Because this is
Remember the planet, what I talked to you about it?
Its like a boat. This is the center of the planet, and the rocking and
rolling thats going to be coming up?
I just heard from somebody in the audience a little while ago that today
there was a massive earthquake in San Jose, Costa Rica.
V1: Oh! Costa Rica. Really!
G: Well it was over a 6. I havent found out what
Another Voice: It was 6.9, I think.
G: Now 6.9. You people that understand the
Voice: Thats pretty big.
G: Well, thats pretty heavy. When you look at the table for doing
earthquake reports, if you go up, every one of them, the game is ten
times bigger than the time before. So youre at 5, you go to 6, thats
ten times bigger than that, and start figuring out the geometric
equation, what its going to do.
So were going to start having some major changes, and probably that will
trigger some more earthquake activity on the northern part of Ecuador.
I think that youre pretty much exempt. Have you had any earthquakes
down here?
Brian OLeary: Weve had a couple but they havent been very strong.
There was one where the epicenter was in Peru, approximately 150 miles
to the east of here, in the Amazon. And that was a 6.5. And we felt it
here, but it wasnt, you know, enough to break anything.
Voice: They felt that one in Quito, too.
G: Youre going to have a lot of the Earth movements. I mean, I was
sitting in Costa Rica. Actually, I was in my dental chair when the
earthquake went off the last time I was down in Costa Rica. [laughs]
You know, we had one about 4.5. It didnt do anything, but the whole
building rattled and I was right in the middle of doing a cleaning and
stuff. But you can live. You can adjust to all of that.
In California a lot of people have had earthquakes. Weve had them.
Theres a thousand earthquakes a day in California. Did you know that?
Voice: Yeah
G: A thousand a day. Part of the information when I was with Billy
Meier, he showed me pictures of San Francisco totally destroyed by an
earthquake. I mean, I saw the pictures, and I cant tell you the date.
He was concerned about that, too.
But I keep looking at: Now wait a minute. This was destroyed by an
earthquake. And I know that San Franciscos a target for a bomb. So that
means the earthquake is going to, you know, take care of California before
the war starts. And theyre planning the war starting very quickly.
Voice: Youre talking about
G: World War III is coming up. Its planned for the second quarter.
Voice: Is it going to be a civil war in the U.S.?
G: The whole world. Its a whole world war. Because were the most hated
country now. Start looking at that information.
I talked to one of my buddies, the head of
FEMA in Arizona, down in
Phoenix. And he said: Were preparing for this. Were going to set up
tent cities along the border. Were not capable of taking care of the
Californians. They cant get out anyway.
But theyre going to allow 100,000 people into Arizona. And I said:
Well, that means
How are you going to stop them?
And he says: Well be setting up tent cities.
And the ultimate plan is theyre going to have passports between States.
Voice: What?
G: Im just telling you whats planned. These guys are doing this, and
of course youre not involved. Theyre not going to put it in the
papers, because thats part of the Fear Factor. But Im just
this is
not a fear factor. This is just well organized from a scientific
standpoint: How do you manage people that are in total chaos?
V1: Who are you talking about when you say they, these guys?
Another Voice: Homeland Security.
G: Well, let me
You dont know me, Joe, too much, but I was asked to be
the Finance Chairman for the election of Jimmy Carter and I was running
around with a group of people that are planning on taking over the
world.
I sat in on their meetings on their goal. Jimmy Carter put it in
writing, every senator and everything. Its called the
Global 2000
Agenda.
In 2000 is when they started hitting Iraq. Theyre behind schedule. They
thought the nations over there would start the war. And you watch the
next little bit. It will begin in Israel. Israel is the number one
target. And probably that will start very shortly.
Russia then will get into it. They got 22,000 nuclear warheads all aimed
at their enemy, which is who?
Voice: The United States.
G: OK? They have three nuclear submarines.
V1: Wait. Whose enemy is who? Who?
G: Russia has three nuclear submarines on the West coast. Theyre two
football fields in length, five stories tall. Theyre capable of doing
80 miles an hour underneath the water, totally undetected.
Another Voice: Off our West coast?
G: Off of our West coast and our East coast.
Voice: So the U.S. is Russias enemy.
G: Yes. Why? Because we have consumed the world and we went into all
these other countries and we tried to rule the world.
Voice: Mm hm.
G: The games over.
Voices: Right.
G: The game is over. Were not ruling the world. People are saying: I
wont do it. So this is part of the plan. Your job now is to get up to
speed. Thats it.
Look at the information theyve put on Camelot. Theyve got all of the
different people that are out lecturing, that know some of the
information. I just happen to have sat in with the guys that are
planning on killing you, frankly. [audience laughter and comments]
Voice: OK. But you said they. So just run down they from the top of
the chain of command for us, all the way down.
G: Well, in the United States its
David Rockefeller which controls,
basically, the Chase Manhattan Bank. And he controls the
Federal
Reserve. In Canada its the Bronfman family.
A book called
The Committee of 300 lists by name the
300 families. Right now, if you get a list of
the CFR and
the Trilateral
Commission, current, youll find theres an interlocking Board of
Directors of all these people. And you can get the names. It wont do
you any good.
Voice: Yeah.
G: Seriously. If you want to know, you can get all the documentation.
There are a group of people. I mean, look, Im sitting in a meeting, you
know, and when they asked me to be the financier, I said:
Why me?
They said: We owe you a favor.
And I said: Why?
And they said because I was doing good things in the finance game.
And I said: I
want to know whats happening.
Look, Henry Kissinger said: The
absolute aphrodisiac is
What?
Voices: Power!
G: You got it. And he also said: Look, the number one problem on the
planet is people! Too many of them. So what they did, they formulated the
Global 2000 Agenda. Theyve actually put up a monument to this - they
think theyve completed it - in Georgia. Its on the internet. Its
called
The Georgia Guidestones.
Voice: Yep.
G: Its already there for you. You can sit down [and read it]. Its in
eight languages.
Voice: What does it say?
G: In eight languages: One world order, one religion, and
500 million
people. Thats their goal - on the entire planet. Now youre going to
have to be brought up to date.
Voice: Thats the internet watching you.
G: Yeah, its around there. And so, this is all part of the problem. Now
what were trying to do at this meeting now is to educate you about
whats coming down.
Voice: Mm.
G: But also to get you prepared, so you can be away from what I call
out of harms way.
Now somebody brought up
chemtrails and all the rest of that. Now, thats
an experiment. After World War II we exploded nuclear warheads in the
higher atmosphere.
Brian OLeary will tell you about this. In that
higher atmosphere, the radiation has gone up and eaten holes in the
ozone layer.
The ozone. Well that was a protection barrier within our planet to
protect us from the gamma and ultraviolet rays. Those rays now are
coming into the planet. Were killing off a thousand life-forms a day,
including the largest oxygen producer on the planet, which is the
plankton, basically, in the oceans.
Voices: Mm hm, yeah.
G: Now, what they do is, they die. And what happens when you put
something in the sun thats black? What does it do? [audience crosstalk]
It starts heating up, doesnt it?
Voice: Yeah. It absorbs more heat.
G: Yeah, its absorbing. All of a sudden its getting hot. Well, weve
got black objects in the ocean. What is the ocean doing? Heating up.
Right? So all of a sudden weve got the poles melting, weve got all
this stuff [happening].
Then these people, scientists again, looking and saying: Well, look, we
got a major problem. Weve got all these huge holes that are moving
around. How do we stop that?
So they tell everybody in the world its the CFCs [Chlorofluorocarbons]
that come out of your refrigerator, so theyll switch you to something
else. Its got nothing to do with that.
Its the nuclear radiation, so then immediately you have all the groups
around the world come up with The Non-Proliferation Agreement on the
nuclear stuff. It has nothing to do with anything other than were
killing ourselves. You didnt know that.
Didnt you know were losing 1000 life-forms a day? Somebody else was
telling me about the birds today. How many people know that all the
pelicans are dying all over the West coast right now, and dropping on
the highways? Today! Why are they doing that? Chemicals, radiation, and
everything else.
So now we have the next situation we have to be analyzed and say: Wait a
minute. What else is happening?
Ive already told you were killing off the water. Somebody mentioned
that they have all this good water up in Michigan. Do you ever realize
how dead that water is right now? Do the analysis and find out whats
going on.
You know, we have the dreams that this is going to change, somebody is
going to change it. Who? You know, whos going to save us?
Well, I went around with the guys. They dont care about you. I mean,
Ive been in Washington, guys. Theres a 100,000 people marching in the
streets. Youre just rabble. These guys are bought and paid for.
[to audience] Yes, Gary?
Gary: You didnt finish your chemtrail thought.
G:
Chemtrails. The scientists decided that there was another way we
might be able to do it: Lets create a net to try to keep the radiation
down. So they put together chemicals, you know, they refined the new
JP4
fuel that comes out of the jets. Its a new system in the jets that are
flying around the planet. How many are flying around? [audience
crosstalk]
Voices: 25,000.
G: 25,000, about that. So they put in new fuel. They put a new component
up there, hoping that this would run around to the top and keep the, you
know, basically the gamma and ultraviolet from getting down.
They also were playing with the
HAARP Project [High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program]. It was eating holes also.
So weve got more than one game going on. Now, how do you keep track of
all this? You understand?
We can be focused on
Lets say Ive got somebody here whos telling me:
Im a whistleblower here. And theres another game going on over here.
They may be doing all the same thing.
But
the elite are, you know, creating their own
underground facilities
in certain places. And they havent got solutions either. Theyve got
some of them. Remember, its all plans. Right?
So its like the Rockefeller compound thats in
Pine Gap, in Australia.
Voices: Yeah.
G: I sat in with one of our governors and he explained to me that he got
his ticket to that. I said: What ticket? And thats when I found out.
You know, certain people got elected. 35,000 people.
When I further investigated, they were hiring workers from India to come
down there. They paid them $50,000 for six months. It took them about six
years. And its totally underground, totally protected. Now, what do you
think the problems going to be?
Voices: Earthquake.
G: No spare parts!
Voices: Oh. [laughter]
G: Now we just got you saying it, but think about it. If you talk to
anybody that lives underground, they dont live very long. You got to get
out and see the sun.
So what weve done
Ive looked at things, around. I flew down to Texas
and I talked to the guys at Monolithic Dome about dome housing, and dome
construction. Because the ETs are telling me, he says: Prepare for 300
to 400 mile-an-hour winds on the surface of the planet. Not every place.
So I said: Wait a minute, 300 to 400 miles an hour? The buildings I
build would fall apart real easy.
And then I started to check into wind velocities. In Mount Baldy,
California, which is out in the San Fernando, you know, at the end of
that string of... Their winds are sustained at over 120 miles an hour.
Look at the hurricanes that are coming up and the speeds that were
having right now. Well, we have these same winds at both Poles.
Meanwhile, everythings melting, everythings changing, were all
getting ready. So today you guys are totally safe right here. We dont
really care whats going on in the world, do we?
Voices: No.
G: You want to forget everything thats going on the world, frankly.
Because it becomes totally insane. It does.
Im sitting here because, you know, Ive sat in on both sides. As I
said, I was one of the guys. Thats only because I learned their
system and they liked me. But then, when I found out what they were
going to try to do, I was trying to explain to people. So I kind of dropped
out, but I still have
That side contacted me because Im the wild card - Im
involved with
extraterrestrials. Theyre monitoring the whole works. Theyre not doing
anything.
You can see their spacecraft. The big stars that strobe red, blue and
green? Those are spacecraft. I mean, were the television set of the
universe right now. [laughter] So what are we going to do?
Voice: Amazing Race. [audience crosstalk]
G: Now Im going to open up, because of the timing and everything, and you
guys have certain questions. I will answer any question and well try to
organize all this. You can always get my videos. You can go online and
listen to Camelot. You can see my other interviews. We have videos, all
kinds of things that can get you up real fast. And Im willing to answer
as much as I can on a personal basis.
Voice: Do you think theyre taking bets? [laughter]
G: And the question I have is: Whos taking bets? Are you my man?
Voice: Yes.
G: No, they think theyve won.
Voice: No, no, I mean, do you think the observers, the ET observers are
taking bets?
G: Theyre concerned. Theyre concerned. Theres more than one group
thats up there. Seriously. I get information all the time and theyre
very happy to support me. Look at me. Ive got a lot of energy. Im
putting it out. Im talking to as many people as I can.
And the only problem that Ive had
Have you read the last message in
Messages for The Ground Crew? How many people in here havent read
the messages?
Quite a few of you. Anyway, theyre just saying theres too few of us on
this planet to make any significant difference. Thats what theyre
saying.
And theyre urging everybody to get together to continue this Game of
Like Minds. Arent we all like minds? Yeah, people like this here, that
understand the situation, understand we got to help each other. And
thats what were all about. You know, its everybody.
Meredith here is, even in her way, is out here doing this, too,
providing light and understanding on a very deep level, awakening the
Spirit to wake you up to whats going on.
Bill and Kerry with
Camelot are running around the planet trying to get
people to, you know, whistle-blow, to show you the facts that are there.
You can go up on the internet, download all the information and discern
it. And go research it yourself.
You dont have to be sitting
You know,
John Lear and I were sitting one
day [talking] about the underground bases, you know, that are supposedly
at
Area 51. Well, theyre not in Area 51. Theyre at
S-4, which is
Thats a huge base out there. Youre probably aware of that.
When I was at Edwards [Edwards Air Force Base], when I saw the
spacecraft as close as you are, you know, at Edwards
I mean, Im
looking at this disk. That wasnt anything to me. It was just another
disk. It was one of the crazy research vehicles we have, you know. And I
got educated, lets put it that way, on whats happening.
So anyway, at this point there are extraterrestrials out here -
our
ancestors. Man did not originate on this planet.
Voice: No?
G: We did not come from here. They engineered us. But they were giving
us
The wild card is free will. We can say: Hey, Im going to heaven,
you know. Ive got some unknown God thats going to come back and save me,
and all I have to do is
You know. Its unbelievable.
The information I have is: Everybody, youre all gone. And then you give
thanks every day for having this experience. Its part of your soul
growth.
Now lets talk about everyday mechanics, logical mechanics of the body.
When the sun comes up in the morning, what hormone is generated in your
body?
Voice: Serotonin.
G: Thats exactly right.
Serotonin. It gets up to bring you into what we
call the 3D world. Thats its job.
When the sun goes down, Mel steps in. Right? Melatonin. OK. Weve got
Sera during the day and Mel at night so you can remember. [laughter] Now
Melatonin goes up and allows you to go to sleep. Thats the way we
should be working.
Voice: Where was she last night? [laughs]
G: We have upset all these things because of the vibration of all thats
happening, so its a little confusing.
But the truth is, your communication, if you set the little prayer: Im
a human becoming, and then you ask the questions, most of the
information, the downloading of your experience is being fed to the
Master, the Creator in the sky who listens to creation between midnight
and four [a.m.]
Thats when youre going to get the best results when you pray. When you
pray youre putting out thought. When you meditate youre supposed to
receive thought.
In the Bible, John 1 says: In the beginning there was the Word. That was
not right. In the beginning was Thought, and thought was God. So its
the thinking of the creation is what were looking at. Do you
understand?
We dont have to look for some mythical person thats going to come back
and save you from harm. They arent going to come back.
Its like the ETs told me: Are you going to be lifted off this planet?
Well, if we took you to another one, youd trash it in half the time.
[laughter] You know how to do it!
Voice: Yeah. Its bad.
G: Its the same situation. Is there anybody going to come back and save
you? No, youre doing it. This is a do-it-yourself job. [laughter] It
really is.
OK. I have some young lady here thats going to ask me a question. Go
ahead. And Ill repeat it so you can hear it in back.
Voice: Oh, I can say it really loud if youd like.
G: Go ahead.
Voice: OK. This is my question: With regard to people of the stature of
Jimmy Carter, who you were asked to be in his administration and even, a
little bit different, Bill Clinton. Hes not exactly in the same league
Im talking about.
Jimmy Carter now almost seems sort of like the Pope of America. Hes
always here and there, and the Nobel Prize and Mr. Peacenik. And he goes
to Russia, and hes like the grand old grandfather, Mr. Wonderful, blah,
blah, blah. How does Jimmy Carter rationalize or reconcile these two
huge polarities? Im just curious. I mean, if you have any
G: Did you hear the question? How do you rationalize Jimmy Carter, who
was a one-term Governor when they asked me to be his Presidential
financial advisor?
I didnt know im. In fact, the question was, I asked them: Who is going
to be the next President? It was two years before he became President.
And they told me Jimmy Carter, and I said: Jimmy who? And they told me,
and I said: Well, thats interesting. I said: Ive been voting
Republican.
And then Paul Volcker (hes about 6-foot-6), he comes over and he says:
Son, dont worry about it. We control them both. Thats the Chairman of
the Federal Reserve at that time, who is the spokesman for
David
Rockefeller. Youre right back to the same
Voice: And knew Obama was. [audience crosstalk]
G: Of course.
Voice: Obama, what?
G: I think I said on your program a year ago or two years ago that
Obama
was going to be President because he was anointed by David Rockefeller.
Voice: Exactly.
G: Ive said that in public, on the station. So youve just seen it all
being fulfilled. Right? It doesnt take a rocket scientist to see what
these people are doing if you can figure out whos the players and who
are not. And just observe it. But dont get caught up in the game.
Voice: Right.
G: This is not the time. Were past the point of getting caught up in
the game. You want to get educated. Nows the time to get into
communities. Form communities and then get yourself prepared to, what?
Total economic collapse. Youre going to have to have some kind of
trading things.
Some people are out here showing me their gold they got in their pocket
like good guys. Which is fine! You know, I always have it. Thats only
because, when this thing crashes, it may do it overnight. Like, Im
dreading it.
I told everybody some time ago: Its going to be a long weekend. When
theres a Friday, you know, a Friday, Saturday, a Sunday, and a holiday.
Youre going to go to sleep on Friday night and itll be all over. And
then theyre going to call their banking holiday.
Thats coming up, probably within the next few months. Thats the reason
why Im very concerned, why Im down here, and why youre all coming
down here to find out whats going on on the planet.
And its not just here. The people I just talked to, theyve got some
bonds in the UK [that] lost 30 or 40% of their value in four months. All
up and down
In Spain theyre doing the same thing. They have all these condos along
the beach, you know, from Malaga on. If youve been down there, its
beautiful. So they built all this stuff out there so you can enjoy it.
Most of the people head off down to the island off Africa.
You know, if you go and look at all of that, everybody wants to go enjoy
themselves. But they dont understand theres people behind the scenes
that are planning on wiping us out. You can enjoy everything. What
youre doing has been created for them. Everythings been created for
them.
[to audience] Yes sir?
Voice: What are the different factions of the ETs? Thats one question.
And then the other is: How much effect do they have on how things are
working out for us here?
G: The question was: How many different factions of ETs? Were being
visited by
all kinds of ETs. I mean, whatever; you name it. Theres one
group that are standing by, rooting for us destroying ourselves because
they want the planet.
Theres the other group that Im involved with that says: Wake up who
you are. Well assist you when you awaken in order to reclaim your
planet and you can be admitted to the Cosmos
if you want to look at it.
We will be able to go to other planets. Well be given the technology to
go to other places and to other planets to survive if we need to. Well
visit them, but well do it on a different basis, based on the four rules
that are spelled out in the Handbook.
And those people should get
the Handbook and read it a couple of times.
Its downloadable free on my website
www.nohoax.com N-O-H-O-A-X. In
fact, the first three books are on it. You can download them. If you want
hard copies, well, theyre all gone here. I only brought a few sets
because a lot of you people already have them. But its a start.
And these books are written, in a way, by them [ETs] to trigger you on a
soul level, to awaken you to whats going on and so you can be in direct
communication. You dont need me. You only need you.
[to audience] Yes?
Voice: George, whats your latest information on
2012? And what are
your
guys, the ETs, telling you about evacuation programs, any of this sort
of stuff?
G: 2012. Frankly, when we were doing the Plan 2000, the fait accompli
You know what that means? Totally completed. The guys want to have the
world depleted down to 500 million by the year 2012.
The ETs arent going to come to lift us off. Where are you going to go?
Are you spiritually ready for all this?
Voice: But I thought we were going
those of us that are awake and aware
and in contact, that were going to be lifted off. And we would return
as fourth-dimensional, transformed
G: Again, thats a lot of what I call New Age nonsense.
Voice: Really?
G: Yes. Look, I have a lot of so-called people, like
J. Z. Knight
Ramtha. Right? I lectured at the
Ramtha group. And I told them flat out.
I did this publicly.
Ramtha told everybody everythings going to come all right, and I said:
Its a lie. [audience crosstalk] Why do you think I did that? Well, its
true.
They were talking about the NESARA programs. Has anybody heard about the
NESARA programs?
Voice: What is that?
G: NESARA. You can look it up on the internet. [audience crosstalk] I
dont care what you do. Its supposedly our government that people up
there are signing that were going to bring our government back to where
it was, back to the Constitution. Do you really believe that? Come on.
You know.
Then guess what? They said our good friend Ron Paul down there was
going to
be heading this all up.
You know, at that time I was involved in another thing with our
Secretary of the Treasury, running down some money, $50 million. Our
Treasury Secretary. You remember Gonzales?
And anyway we were running some of the money down that was being
laundered for the so-called Weed. I published some of this stuff.
I even got the publishing trade mad at me when I published the truth on
the Kennedy stuff. So, you know, you dont do that. It doesnt do any
good for any one of us. I mean, I had the documents. You can read them
all.
And the Plan. What are you going to do about the Plan 2000? Theyve
already endorsed it.
[to audience] Yes?
Voice: OK. Another question: So you dont agree that were going into a
new section of the galaxy which is a higher density, the Earth is
actually evolving, youre in fourth density. And that we need to, as
part of our development, transmute to this higher level of understanding
and consciousness that we can actually function in.
G: Lets put it this way: Those people that are coming up to the
awareness level, the frequencies will be automatically changing and
youll be merged in like you wont even know anything happened. But as
far as any miracle about coming back the way it is now? You tell me that
the way it is now is working? [laughter]
Voice: Well, the information that Ive obtained and sort of acknowledged
is fairly scientifically based. Its on David Wilcocks site. Hes
really come out with a lot of the, you know
G: I know David.
Voice: Yeah. I really like his stuff about the, um, scalar technology,
the way that were evolving that way. Youre saying that were just
going to change automatically, and then were going to end up in this
halcyon fourth dimension thing, and the third dimensional Earth is going
to just go kaput.
G: No, Im not saying any of that. Youre not sure that the third
dimension
and why worry about all that? I mean, seriously, why worry
about it? The logic of the universe
Its not like turning on a light
switch and youre going to go do all of this.
I mean, you know, how they teach
Over in India for instance, if you
look at their religions background on it, they say its like the
elephant: Hes just going to lay over on its side and go back to sleep
and will cease to exist.
Voice: OK. We need
G: Anyway, the question that you have: Do I believe that? Not from the
information that Ive had on a very logical basis, coming into it.
Yes, there is some frequency changes on it and those people that want to
go back and just lay down: Well, Ill just wait for it to happen. Its
not going to happen. YOU got to do it. You have to take an active part in
raising your consciousness, which is the frequency changes.
Voice: Well Ive done all that, and I know what I know. [audience
crosstalk] But, George, I mean, realistically we want something
practical, some really practical guidelines on how we can make a
difference here.
I mean, Im frustrated to hell with hearing all this stuff, knowing all
this stuff, doing all this stuff. Ive been doing it for 30 years, and
nothing is changing. What have we got to do to change the paradigm,
change the energy structures and do this?
Voice: Its her fault! [laughter]
G: Did she say shes been doing it for 30 years? Well it should have
been done. [laughter]
Voice: Ive been doing all the research, I mean with you and everybody
else. I mean, were all here, knowing the
G: Were all here to understand that we all have to collectively do
things, but we will be guided. Im telling you, we will be guided.
Voice:
the truth is, wouldnt you say, we build a machine
G: No.
Voice: Were going to be knocked up, were going to be knocked over and
killed like so many other people have done before. I mean we need to
know what we can practically do to do this. I mean, what
Stephen Greer
did in 2001, I thought was fantastic.
Disclosure made a lot of
difference to a lot of
G: Well then, what we have to look at is what will make a difference on
the planet. Im asking for guidance. And you know what my guidance is?
To come out to awaken people out here, to let them instill in themselves
whats coming down and get ready for it all. Thats what my guidance is.
Voice: Were ready. Were ready.
G: No youre not.
Voice: Not really.
G: Youre waiting for something to happen. Youre waiting for
something
to happen.
Voice: No. We want to do something. We want to be able to participate
and do something.
G: Then start a community. Help other people get going so they can
survive this.
Voice: Im here. Im here.
G: OK. Then youre starting. [to audience] Yes, Alphonso?
Alphonso (A): Just curious two questions. What do you know about the
600 FEMA camps in the U.S. and ah
G: I dont know a thing about 600. Its 1400.
A: 14! [laughter, crosstalk]
G: Oh yeah. Actually they have a list of them on the internet. You may
have them on Camelot or youve made reference to them.
Voice: What is the question?
G: FEMA. What do I know about the
600 FEMA camps across the United
States?
Thats Federal Emergency Management Agency thats all setting up. Why do
I know about the military, one of our Divisions coming back to say
theyre getting ready to round up and control the people that are going
to be in these camps? Right?
The camps are because people are going to be out of money, out of work,
and everything else. And theyre going to have to be, what? Nannies. So
the FEMA camps are set up.
Thats where, when I was asked to be, you know, the Finance Chairman,
and asked to build an enemy prisoner of war camp. It says Enemy right on
the sign as you go to Vegas. And my question is: Who is the enemy? You
know. It could be Patrick or Henrietta, or Darren.
Voice: Trading with the enemies.
G: Well we are. Were all trading with the enemies.
I dont have all the answers. I know, I run around with the guys that
are planning this and they plan it every day, something different,
because it didnt work out well. Same thing with you. You design a
building. I build a building, and I get the thing up there.
I stayed in Beijing. I stayed with a guy where the people were building
their apartments. I said: Thatll never work, the way they were doing
it. Are you familiar with Chinese thinking?
Voice: A little bit.
G: Well, the Chinese at that time were building what we called
poured-in-place concrete buildings, structures. And youre required to
take care of your parents. So theyd have one room for the parents, one
room for you the living room - and the other room was for the bedroom
for them and the kids. And the kitchen was one end of the complex, for
everybody on the floor. And the other end was the necessary room,
actually a hole in the floor. And thats how they built these
structures.
But I found out - when I talked to them, I said: It doesnt work.
Because, crazy me, I built an apartment complex out in Colorado and its
like a deck of cards. You pour the concrete down and you put the
reinforcement on and you pick up all of them and put them into place. It
makes sense, doesnt it?
Let me tell you what the problem was, because I had to tear down this
apartment. I got the building up, everything down. Everybody loved the
thing. And then the wintertime came in. And one of the problems is we
didnt put insulation on the walls.
And thats the same way they did in it China, no insulation. So what we
did is, the heat that we set up there, by osmosis it brought in moisture
on the walls. What happened to the walls with the moisture and the heat
in the wintertime? Can you tell me?
Voice: Mold?
G: Mold. The most pitiful mold. Everywhere. Every part. Im standing
there, looking: Oh my God. What did I do? And then we looked at it.
Theres no way you can get rid of it. Well, I took a bulldozer. I had
to. [laughter] It was the only way to deal with the problem.
Voice: Just a question: How would you advise people to transfer their
wealth during this economic
G: From a very standard basis, were in a world economy that trades
business-to-business. Right? Well, in Ecuador right now you can go start
a business, a corporation. They advise you to do that. It costs you
whatever the attorneys are, well, $1,500.
Voice: $1,500?
G: $1,500, you can get them in Cuenca. If theres different ones, you can
negotiate with and get your thing. Anyway a corporation then is an
existing entity. Now by that, a corporation is a person. And you get to
control that person. Right? This country now says there has to be two
legitimate people, one at least an Ecuadorian, on the corporation to do
it. Thats the new rules.
But now the corporations going, and you have it. You can transfer money
from your other corporation, or any money that you have, to the
corporation and theyre not going to say anything. So thousands and
millions of dollars can be transferred without a problem.
In the States, there was one state that allowed you to incorporate, only
needing one officer. You had 100% rule. Now theyre coming out with new
rules, too, so everythings being controlled. Let me just tell you,
theyre coming down to squeeze all the things down.
But if you have money, they dont have any problem with transferring
money in here right now. Now, its going to be in dollars. And thats
the reason why Im looking into other facilities.
My friends over in Panama, they have the biggest banks there. Theyre
concerned too, because what do they do? Theyre laundering all the drug
money and everything else. Right? So they got billions.
But we got to go to the next step - Columbia. Theyve got what they call
the Columbianization of Mexico. Seriously. And the Bush signed an
Executive Order saying you could not talk about Mexico and whats going
on right now, because they were talking about the new currency,
supposedly uniting them all.
Well, the Prime Minister of Canada says: No way. Right? I dont know him
at all. I did spend some time [there] when I was asked to be finance
chairman for Carter. I sat with Pierre [Trudeau] and his wife. So I knew
them.
Other things go on - you have no idea - behind the scenes. Because
what is told to the public is totally different than may be behind the
scenes, and theyre running the agenda. And it all follows the money.
Follow the money.
You could be the best guy in the world. Even my senator said that within
six months you will not recognize the dollar. And Im looking at that.
[to audience] Let me get you another question.
Voice: Do you know where in Ecuador you can buy gold coins or gold?
G: The people who want to buy gold coins, if youll put together your
name and telephone number, I have the people that have them. And you can
buy and take control, and theyll be ready, hopefully in the next two
weeks. They were trying to get governmental approval, like Monday or
Tuesday of next week. And theyll have everything ready to roll and then
down in Cuenca you can get one-ounce pieces.
They were laughing about this. They were going to call it the Rose, or
the Panda, or whatever, you know. Its beautifully designed. But these
will be available in a week. So give me your name, or give to Brian.
Theyll give to me and Ill tell you how to get it. And theyll contact
you.
[to audience] Yes sir?
Voice: George, you mentioned about gold coins in Ecuador.
Hugo Chavez
said he was going to try to organize some more South American countries,
for a South American currency.
G: Yeah. The question is: Hugo Chavez is trying to organize several
South American countries together to create a new central bank for all
of them. And its for all of them. Its called the South American Bank.
Its on
the internet.
They havent got it 100% put together, all the details, because theres
still some arguing about how to fund all this stuff. Some of the
countries have money; some dont have it right now. Right?
They want to create a currency, like the Euro was created out of thin
air? Well the Euro - theyre fighting among each other right now and
dont want to join in. The Euros in Spain. And somebody said that
Greece is no longer good. And, you know, Germanys controlling that.
Unemployments growing like crazy.
And in America we have the same problem. Its happening there. Its a
world-wide phenomenon. So thats where were at at that point.
Anyway, you were asking about whats going on on that. I was for that
because it would make a basic currency. I was hoping they would go with
the gold base.
Now, my senator in Idaho is this week I believe, presenting a bill to
create a currency in Idaho - our own currency to use within the state,
backed by silver.
[to audience] Yes?
Voice: What about playing other semi-sane independent currencies, say,
like Australia? Or like New Zealand? We played the Euro maybe for a
while. I dont really know how long term, but at least as an alternative
to the dollar and having gold. (inaudible)
G:
EVERBANK in Florida allows you to set up a basket of currencies in
your account.
Voice: There are a lot of places too that want to do that. How long will
this other trend continue and will they benefit from the drop in the
dollar, at least for a while, even though they could be damaged by that?
G: You know, frankly Im looking at a shut-down for a while, so I dont
know whether youre going to have any currency whatsoever.
Voice: I understand. But think about it. The worldwide shut-down is
possible to come after a devaluation of the dollar.
G: What you want to do is make money off of everybody elses
Voice: No, but
G: What I want you to do is preserve your assets.
Voice: That is exactly what Im talking about. In the last six months to
a year, getting out of the dollar and getting into gold was, you know,
devastating to many people. First off, dealing with a manipulative
situation is very difficult to do.
G: Well
Voice: We lost money in silver. We lost money in gold. We lost money.
G: A lot of people were making money in gold and silver this last year,
too, so you cant say all.
Voice: Oh, absolutely not. Its a trading kind of deal. It always is.
Its what you said
we dont know
G: I have a problem, as an underwriter. I predict theyre going to shut
the market down.
Voice: Is that the market worldwide? Or the market in the U.S.?
G: In the U.S.
Voice: Yeah, so thats not worldwide.
G: But theyre all interconnected.
Voice: I know that, but will they allow all these countries to go into
it with the crash?
G: Thats the reason why World War III has to start. Whos going to end
up on the top of the heap?
Voice: I see what youre saying, but I dont actually believe it. It
could happen in stages. I mean, think about it. Theyre not going to
want the whole world to crash.
G: Yes they are.
Voice: They want to end up somewhere on top, as you say.
G: No. We dont know whos going to be on top.
Voice: Right. I agree with you.
G: I sat in on a meeting with a dozen people who were talking about
using chemicals, biologicals, everything. Right? We adjourned. About six
of us went into another room and said: We want to get rid of some of the
people in the other room. [laughter]
They dont even care. And I cant tell you whos going to be up on top
when we get through, in the world. But I know that world leaders -
world - not just the United States, that world leaders want to
reduce
the world population.
And isnt keeping the economic game because youre just a human resource
and so is your money.
And somebody just told me this: Theyre putting up a law right now.
Theyre trying to put it together in England. They want to tax your
savings. [laughter]
Voice: I understand. Were all trying to do a day-to-day.
G: Its a day-to-day. I dont have an answer for you.
Voice: I understand.
G: I just dont have an answer. Im just saying, my own personal self,
everythings in metal.
[to audience] Yes?
Voice: George, I find this utterly valuable, and I wish to know whether
you have made an arrangement, or commitment, or decision that you will
have this talk released on the internet soon, or released so we can
purchase it?
G: You have to talk with somebody else in this room back here because
theyre planning on putting it up on their own site, Project Camelot.
Voice: So Camelot will? OK.
G: Im asking. Will Camelot do it? Yeah, they are.
Voice: Im curious. When do you foresee the COMEX fold which manipulates
the gold and silver prices?
G: If you pull up Gavin [Wendt] are you familiar with Gavin? Anyone
familiar with Gavin?
Voices: Yes.
G: Theyre pretty much the guys that are monitoring it. When I was over
at the Silver conference
There was a conference from all over the world
silver - I was there about a month and a half ago and they were
concerned too. See, its affecting them. Theyre shutting down the mines
in the United States right now.
And the same thing with the oil companies. Oil companies are shutting
down production because oil is down cheaper than when it
It should be
about $80 a barrel right now for oil at this point rather than the $40
they have. So they know its going to come back up.
Voice: What about
Lindsey Williams suggestion that they are doing this
with the prices in order to bankrupt the Arabs?
G: No. You know, I know what Lindsey said and hes coming out with all
these things. The Arabs
And their problem is, they dont tell anybody
how much oil they have left in the ground. And so we have: Yeah, we have
a lot of oil. But remember, thats been the currency but now that
currency is collapsing. So its causing a lot of oil people to come
down, you know, to stop them. Its the same thing.
But its not just this. This is a world thing. So Im telling you, in
order to get the Arab nations worked out, lets get the war started.
And, you know, Obama gets in. Hes going to be stuck with a stacked deck
pretty soon and because all this money they put out in loans are all
short-term loans. Theyre not 20-year loans. Theyre all day loans.
When you borrow, hear this.
[to audience] Yes maam?
Voice: Going back to the gold question. Here in Ecuador, Correa is going
to allow mining, open-pit mining for gold, because the largest reserves
in the world are here in Ecuador.
G: I know.
Voice: Theyre going to ruin our mountains. Theyre going to ruin our
water supply just because of the gold everybody is seeking now. What is
the sense in it?
G: Theres no sense in that. And Ive wanted to talk to him about it.
And there are some things in there so they will not affect the
environment as such. But hes also trying to
Voice: How? Theres no such thing as open-pit mining without affecting
the environment.
G: Yeah there is, there is. Theres a brand new
I was with the mining
company.
Voice: How can they do it?
G: Well, we have a new mining vehicle that basically doesnt do any of
that. It goes through all the stuff, and as long as its the right kind
of stuff
But we can go out and there are ways to take it out without
polluting it all.
Voice: Do they still need cyanide and mercury?
G: No! No,
Another Voice: No. No mercury.
G: They have new tech. I looked at the machine. Im sitting there
looking at it. This guys the largest silver miner in the world, thats
the President of the company. He doesnt sell any to somebody else. And
hes going to come down.
And I was working with the Peña Brothers - Anybody know of them? They
have this huge process that the Inca - the old Inca gold stuff on it.
And by looking at the information on it, it was a way we could go and
process it. But I was going to use the new processing equipment that
they have and then have the government endorse this stuff and then we
can create the gold for the government to use as a reserve and create
the best currency.
Voice: Exactly.
Another Voice: But the government is a disappointment. They want to sell
the rights to the mining to the foreign companies.
G: Well theres no money in it. [audience talk] Theres a very new law,
and theres no money in it.
Voice: (crosstalk)
G: Well, anyway, the government situation is changing on a day-to-day
basis. Theyre working on it. In my little way Im trying to assist them
to analyze it. Most people wont even recognize the transfer because it
goes by the piece of paper that you have. [to audience] Yes?
Voice: What you predict, that these people want to get the world down to
500 million?
G: Yeah, they put it in writing.
Voice: So I was wondering, really, if that many people were to die from
all these different
what is it going to matter, a big box of gold? I
mean, whos going to really care?
G: Theyre not. Theyre not.
Voice: Whats the point of it?
G: The gold is merely a storage of wealth, temporarily, while we can
acquire some things to order this, to facilitate yourself, because your
dollars going to go down a whole lot faster than gold. When its all
over, gold wont be worth anything, either. Itll be your seeds
Voice: Right. Its back to the land.
G: Yeah, and even that
People have said the only thing is going to be land. And even that is going to be subject to: Whos going to enforce
the ownership of the land? What legal system do you have? You know, real
estate. Its the old thing that I used to tell people: You have
contractual right to use the air space because the government owns it.
And as long as there is a government that will enforce what theyre
talking about, which is
How many people in Ecuador? 13 million?
Voice: 13 million. Thats right.
G: About 13 million people, so thats not a big thing to take care of.
The land area is about the same size as Colorado, you know, my home
state.
And its the same type of thing, a lot of minerals, a lot of everything.
But youve got incredible vegetation. You have a lot of protection,
natural protection, because of these mountains and everything. And the
water has not been too polluted as yet.
You know, they dump everything into the ocean down there in Guayaquil
and everything. That throws things off, but thats happening all over
the planet. Look at the United States. Theres not any rivers in the
world right now that actually reach the ocean that arent polluted.
[to audience] Yes sir?
Voice: Ive thought about when the dollar crashes and Ecuador is using
the dollar, so Ecuador will have to change currencies.
G: The paper for printing the new currency is here in the country right
now. Theyre in the process - youve probably read that - in the
process of printing.
Voice: So Americans that are migrating to Ecuador, do you think there
could be some backlash as far as the Ecuadorians with the American
currency bottoming out and therefore Ecuadorians losing a lot of money
or savings, as well?
G: Well, again, youre asking something hypothetical. I talked to the
representative from the Swiss bank. A lot of Ecuadorians with money have
moved it to Switzerland - the dollar.
Ive talked to some other people down here. Yeah, theyre very concerned
about it. Im actually lecturing at the University this next week, to
all the students, on the economic thing, to give them the whole thing.
The school itself is in a dilemma because theyre telling their students
how they can live economically in a world thats been based on trading
goods and stuff on the systems that exist, and theyre all coming apart.
And I cant tell you whats going to happen, I just live day-by-day. I
go down and have my assets in metal and I can play with them.
Voice: What about shipping into Ecuador, as long as shipping continues
from other places in the world?
G: Well, you know in the United States theyre stopping a lot of the
shipping down there because the big ships didnt have any money. They
were shipping the stuff on Letter of Credits rather than on the actual
cost of running them over.
But their fuel costs last year were running like about $22,000 a day for
fuel to run those big ships, and it went up to $80,000, which is
transferred back into the goods again. Right?
And the shipping thats going to be done here, youre going to keep
doing it because we are still exporting out of Ecuador. Youll be
exporting products and everything for a while. Im looking at this as
If a global war gets going, all bets are off on everything. All bets.
[to audience] Yes sir?
Voice: Ive battled with remaining in the United States versus going
somewhere else. Ive got a family infrastructure, people, so you dont
want to leave the people youre with. But what youre describing is
pretty serious. If theres something that tremendous going to happen in
the U.S., it almost seems you wont even be unable to leave, as if well
be in lock-down.
G: There will be a lock-down. So if youre going to make any move, its
like
Voice:
Martial law?
G: Of course. Theyve got that all set up, martial law, and again,
theyve got it selected. If youre going to make your move - my wife,
she says: if you havent made your move now, youve got maybe 60 days or
so to do anything. After the 60 days
And shes feeling the same way. She sees the future of it. Shes telling
me about April. I said I dont know. April or May. I know the second
quarter makes economic sense for the guys that are planning. You see,
the gaming is to see how long they can keep it together, squeeze out the
last of the money.
Voice: Yeah, thats exactly
Another Voice: The money stops, then the airports stop.
G: Thats right.
Another Voice: If you cant buy a ticket, you cant do anything.
G: Well, if youre over in Miami like my friend just did
I have a CIA
guy that dropped out of the CIA. He went over and bought a little
26-footer boat. And he took off, and he ended up down in guess where?
Hes in Colombia today. He said theyre not going to know. Hes going to
hide out. Theyre going to have to come out and get me. So
[laughter]
[to audience] Yes?
Voice: Colin Powell and Joe Biden said on two different interviews that Obama will face a crisis on the 21st or 22nd of
[audience crosstalk]
And that he will take a decision that the people might not like. Do you
have any idea what this crisis is?
G: Heres my analysis of that, because everybodys looking at dates.
When
Bush put these things into it, he tabled everything up to those
approximate dates, on the economy. And theyre all saying the economy is
the big thing.
They dont have an answer right now other than collapsing the whole
economy because they havent addressed all of the Derivatives. I mean
theres over $100 trillion in Derivatives unaccounted for that are
keeping our whole country together, supposedly, in our trading system,
but nobodys buying it.
Foreign governments say: Prove its value. Well, how can you do it?
Accounting-wise, theres no such thing.
[to audience] Sir?
Voice: Yes. George, according to your sources and your information, what
is your best understanding as to whats going to happen on
December 21,
2012?
G: People are aware the 2012 date is all coming up and thats a point
within our universe which the planet travels through, this cycle. And
were reaching a point where the end-beginning of this cycle, as
the
Mayans say, and well begin a new one.
And thats only going into the Aquarian age, talking from one standpoint
on it. That goal is where, possibly, when were going to be in a part of
the universe where everythings aligning, where the possibility is,
during that same year, that the planet may flip on its axis.
So we have all these geophysical things that are going to be escalating.
My sources are saying beginning this year and next, we escalate. So
everybodys aware theres something going on. It isnt going to be an
overnight thing. For some people it will be overnight.
[to audience] Yes?
Voice: What about
Planet X, Nibiru, theyre talking about coming back?
G: Nibiru? Well its the same time. See, all these things coincide. Its
a, you know, 3,600-year cycle. [to audience] Yes.
Voice: If theres a lock-down, will foreigners that are living in the
United States be able to exit the country or will they also be in
lock-down?
G: The whole countrys going to be in a lock-down. And thats the reason
why we mentioned the FEMA camps, the 4000. There are going to be so many
people and youre going to go over there. The rule book says if youre
over age 44, youre going to be eliminated unless you have a talent they
can use. And eliminated by all means necessary, again.
Voice: What is your understanding of what will happen in Europe and
Australia?
G: Well, Australia because of all the
.Again, the world effects are down
there. Theyre having the same kind of problems. Their economy is now
collapsing. They have weather down there that theyve never had before.
So we have all of this chaos that you have to address.
What I want you to do is forget worrying about the chaos and that and
get yourself, again, into groups to prepare yourself with as much
knowledge as you need to get at this point.
I mean, you and I can talk about these dates and all the rest of it. And
I can call my friends up there and they say: Were going to do it on
next Thursday. But as soon as we say a date then somebody else is going
to change it because, you know, one guy comes in.
And the guys that are up on top, they want this program to go on. And
theyre looking for other triggers to blame somebody else on it. Thats
exactly what they are.
[to audience] Yes?
Voice: I know were here to discuss solutions, and I think thats very
savvy. But I want to go back to the concept of intention, the 100th
Monkey concept, and hope. I would like to hear your thoughts on
Arent
there enough people intending? Isnt there enough critical mass?
G: [to the audience] Did you hear the question? The Law of Intent that
theyre talking about?
Voice: Mm hm. Yeah.
G: Im just going to re-read. If its OK, Im going to re-read just the
last couple of pages. This is the last messages that I got for the
public thats involved
in this book, which will answer it. All right?
As noted before in the materials, multiple far-reaching cycles are
coming to completion simultaneously. As in current expression, this
brings on the good news and the bad news.
Those who have the eyes to see and hear will celebrate the good news of
the opportunity to at last, at long last, complete the human experience
cycle.
Those who choose not to hear or see will have the privilege of the bad
news, of being allowed to begin over again. Being left behind is not a
happy experience.
Those who complete will not be chosen. They will choose to be chosen.
Will you learn what you need to know through the traditional
institutions of science or religion? Not in their present forms.
That is not to say that its not possible for them to change in their
focus of maintaining their current dogmatic beliefs at all cost. The
question lies as to whether its worth the risk to wait to find out.
If your present group focus hasnt begun to offer more than its usual
fare, it is suggested that you, at the least, begin to supplement the
teachings by looking outside and considering material that contains a
newer and larger focus.
This does not include the information available thats focused on
religion-bashing or science-bashing. This is not a constructive use of
your attention.
That you may observe certain inadequacies in the teachings and
information made available by these institutions is one thing. But the
focus should be on building a foundation of openness towards a change of
attitude and the introduction of new ideas and thought processes.
The history of the human experience has been purposely obscured and
distorted, not to say that the teachers are not sincere or that they do
not believe in what theyre teaching.
A composite can be gleaned from the currently available New
Information that indicates truth, but its scattered among multiple
publications and authors. Most important is the search for the truthful
in the human experience as a whole.
Why are you here? What is it that is not being accomplished that must be
accomplished in the short time yet before the completion of these
cycles? The wheels within the wheels will not pause even for a moment
for individuals to catch up.
Its a do-or-die, now-or-almost-never
moment in cosmic history.
Voice: Yes.
G:
Is there an urgency being conveyed in these messages? Indeed, there
is! Dead center or sliding back are both dangerous modes to be within.
Will Jesus or any other Saint do it for you? Sorry, but no. Help
you? Absolutely, yes!
You will receive your help to support you and encourage you
through YOUR
process.
Each of them was caught up in an experience similar to your own. They
are now who they are because it was important for them to change their
experience and move onward in their individual process which, in turn,
serves the cosmic plan for all.
Think of it as a great ladder with always a helping hand to make the
next rung. The hand is there, but you must choose to reach out and grasp
it for the purpose of getting to the next rung.
Its not there to give sympathy, nor listen to excuses, or hear blame of
someone else or a corrupt system. Each must exercise discernment, use
wisdom earned through the experience and choose to keep on keeping on.
The energy to do this is now there to be used in the process. It does
not come first. Now is the time to wake up, become aware of what
surrounds you and decide if it is good enough, or whether more worth
desiring is enough to commit to attaining at all cost.
Those who are able to look back, so to speak, desire whole-heartedly
that you choose carefully. Its a monumental decision.
Its time-out for this repetitive series of experiences, and to
experience life as it was intended within the perpetual moment, not
perpetual repetitive cycles of the karmic glue. You are blessed with a
restless urge to complete your cycle. Listen to it!
Its with regret that we inform you that
the window of opportunity to
salvage your planet and its human inhabitants is now closing. We are
grateful for those beings that have heard the warnings and have turned
their attention towards the creation of a more desirable outcome.
Regretfully, that number is too few to make any measurable difference.
The days ahead will be difficult and discouraging for those who now know
what might have been. It is our suggested advice that those who are
committed to their service as ground crew redouble their efforts to
draw to themselves a circle of believers to support each other through
the days ahead.
There is now more important activity for this viable force of so few in
order to focus the attention on the survival of some awake and aware
individuals through times to come. Its vitally important that this be
done!
These words are the most discouraging message that has been given to you
from this source. Its not intended to indicate that your assistance in
this cause is finished, but instead it is more important than ever.
Depressing as they sound, they simply indicate that each must draw from
within themselves the ability to become more committed than ever to the
intention of finding ways to apply the universal laws in every situation
that arises in daily life.
Within every circumstance there is opportunity! The laws do work. But,
remember the laws work for all who apply them, but more cooperatively
with those that apply them in harmony with the creative flow of energy
intended to expand and enhance the evolvement of conscious
awareness toward perfect wisdom.
As difficult as the planetary situation is, there is a purpose to it.
Mankind MUST learn to be a responsible being individually, which then in
composite form is reflected in the planetary whole.
It also must be remembered that the adversarial energies that have been
applied have been carefully planned and carried out over eons of
sequential time, not just now.
Humanity has been considered only as pawns in a chess game that contains
more power-plays than the third dimensional mind can grasp. This does
not relegate humanity to an unimportant role, conscious awareness at the
top of the creational pile and not to be taken lightly.
However, it is for this same conscious awareness to become aware of
itself and its purpose through the experience gained in self-created
circumstances based on the Law of Attraction.
And remember, youre the extension of that, so were all part of this
incredible multi-level game. I wont go any farther than that. Theres a
couple more pages of it, and it just says
Ill read you one more
paragraph because it does apply to us.
In the days to be experienced by humanity as time winds down, its
necessary for those of you who are now in the know, so to speak, to
begin to focus on what might be called holding the pole.
Do you know what that means? Stay in the observer mode. Its a huge play
thats being set up. Youre getting all kinds of information. Observe
the play as its coming on. Dont get caught up with it.
Only get caught up in the play that you are doing in creating stuff, and
dont look for any outside help to help you because its a
do-it-yourself project again. Theres so much information in these
things that itll blow you away!
[to audience] Any more questions back there?
Voice: I dont know a lot of the things that youre talking about. I
know them intuitively, but Im not really financial. I dont look at
that. I feel changes coming with finances. I felt it when it started to
go down last year in the fall. And I was actually talking about that in
January of last year.
But what I know is this, is that timelines and information that comes
from the ETs is always questionable, as far as what it is thats going
to take place.
So, although you read that one line that said, you know: The window is
closing, they did not say: The window is now closed, period. You said:
The window is now closing. So that is partly where hope comes in.
Also, youve been talking about the
Plan 2000. And again, Im not
familiar with that information. But what I do hear and what I sense in
the information that I have, is that we still, although there are not
massive numbers of us that are extremely awake and aware of whats going
on, that we as human beings have even thrown that off course.
So, we do still have hope, but we need to prepare for the worst and
understand that theres always hope for the best in any scenario. Thats
my comment on that.
G: The suggestions and the information she has is valid, except for
we
now have to come in to a timeline from a scientific standpoint.
The universe has got some finite points that were going to be hitting
which happen to coincide with all of these things. And so we have to
look at that.
And remember, all the information that we have has been well-studied by
the guys upstairs. They have analyzed everything down to the detail, and
so they know the timing and they have it, as far as the universal stuff.
Now, their goals: Theyre behind schedule, so you know it isnt all
working! I mean we saw that in the year 2000, so you know, theyre just
behind.
Voice: So, you know, if the other side, so to speak, is taking
precautions and theyve got these underground military bases that house
over a million people and
G: Theres no million people.
Voice: Huh?
G: Theres no million people underground.
Voice: Underground space for them?
G: No.
Voice: When this happens?
G: No. Its a limited number.
Voice: Oh, OK.
G: Australia was 35,000. I didnt get one of the tickets. [laughter]
Voice: OK. So therefore, where does that leave us that are, even though
were south of the equator, if were above ground?
G: You have a better chance being here. I just told you that the
Northern Hemisphere is going to be the most devastated.
Voice: Right. I know that.
G: So this side of the thing, you have a better chance.
Voice: But now do we have to start looking at underground housing? Would
we be better off?
G: No, but I think you can start looking
Watch the winds change.
Seriously. Watch the winds, the currents of the weather.
Domes are
Ecologically they set up, the ones that I build. I mean you
can heat them with ten 100-watt light bulbs. Seriously!
Voice: And theyll withstand the winds, etcetera?
G: Well, if you look at it and you study that
I show you one on my
website and in my video. My wife said: Can I have one of those? And I
built it myself. Weve got one out there in Vegas on the strip. Ive
been building them. My wife lived in one for five years. I mean, her
average utility bill was $50 a month year round.
Voice: Can we get any down here?
G: Sure. You can get them anywhere. Were working on a project right now
in Cuenca and if I have enough time to do all of this stuff, we may be
doing it out of adobe, in a new system.
But I dont have all these answers yet, guys. Im sitting here with you
and I should be over with some of these other guys that are trying to do
the same thing. And theyre aware
Voice: Which website has the information about the domes?
G: Well,
monolithic dome. Yeah, monolithic dome. Look it up. Theyll
tell you about all the domes.
Kerry Cassidy (K): But actually we have a witness that says
G: A witness?
K:
that those domes are not going to withstand the winds. Not just the
winds, but the trees that are turned into, like, projectiles.
G: Lets talk about what youre talking about.
K: Theyll hit the domes.
G: No, I will. We build them. Im sitting here looking at it. We
discussed that problem with David South whos the president of the
company and he says: Look, Im not worried about it. Ive been building
them for years.
Were not worried about the winds particularly. Its those tree limbs
that are going through the air at 400 miles an hour?
Voice: Yes.
G: Right. But because we use the reinforced concrete and we lay it out
in a certain way
yeah, the tree may hit it, but youre going to have a
little hole that you can easily patch up.
Im not worried about the over-all structural thing. Its an egg. Its
the strongest thing you can have!
And were also looking at coming down several feet underground and also
going underneath to build basements and stuff underground with that on
top. So you have the winds against that. We have
K: Theres also
Earthships. I dont know if you know. Their sites on
the web. Earthships are built out of earth and, you know, they can be
built partially underground. Theyre self-contained.
G: Thats great. Thats part of the process Im going to be talking this
week up in Cuenca with people that have the ground and want to use this.
And I have my friends that are engineers on the subject that are flying
down to help.
So we have all these things that are happening. Im just telling you. I
cant
You guys have to start doing this stuff. I can help assimilate
some of it.
[to audience] Yes, sir.
Voice: George, theres another major way to build dome houses. An
Iranian architect by the name of Khalil [ed. note:
Nader Khalili] a very
kind man, attempted to create housing out of the off-casts of war, using
barbed wire and sandbags, and hes created this system.
If you fill these bags
and they actually make continuous bags now so
they can be filled with sand if you have sand, clay if you have
whatever. And the website is
calearth.org. Khalili has passed away. Are
you familiar with this?
G: Yeah. Well, Tom Hyde was my architect in Denver. We built a church
that way. Wed use
What we did was took all the sand, we had all the sand companies bring
in all the sand, huge mounds of sand, and wed come in with the concrete
and pour it over and then we tooled it. Then we took all the sand out
from underneath.
So that was another way you can do that. Just to tell you theres a lot
of ways we can do that.
Another problem that you have with the monolithic dome deal, which I
love
is because they put four inches of insulated foam it makes it so
theyre basically, you know, totally energy-efficient. And like I say,
you can heat them with ten 100-watt light bulbs. I mean, we dont have
this kind of, you know, air space and everything down around it, and
also because of the dome
And I looked at all the other things. I had a friend that built a dome
down in Arizona, down in Sedona, and he used little pieces of like nails
through the steel. And I objected to that. I mean, its built down
there. Youve probably seen it. Well, they have it down there. We had a
friend, too.
But I looked at it and I said: Now from an engineering standpoint all
you have is a bunch of nails. Whats really holding it together?
The reinforced concrete
we wire them and set it up so, there we
wouldnt have any slippage.
Voice: Well, what I described is just the initial idea. Its gone way
beyond that. But one of the differences between all these ideas that
have been discussed
this is a low-tech, very low cost, basic material
format.
G: Were planning on doing the same thing in Cuenca. For $20,000 you get
a house. Is that all right?
Voice: Were talking a tiny fraction of that.
G: Well, you cant because you have to end up with
Look the price of
the house is nothing. Its the crazy utensils on the top, running the
copper wiring, you know, the stuff you have inside.
When you add in
What does a fixture cost for the bathroom right now? I
mean, you guys know. You can spend $20,000 putting in a bathroom or you
can spend $4,000.
The outside structures only one thing. I mean, were talking about
using domes. Theyre basically made with adobe bricks. Were setting
them up in a new form, a better one.
Were working on it. I have people working on it. I cant do everything.
Maybe thats your job. [laughter]
Voice: Hearing about all the living underground and the Earth shift and
the domes and stuff and living in the Southern Hemisphere. I dont know,
it seems like you cant [unclear] if you have to live in some of these
domes and youve got conspiracies and youve got big trees coming at
you. [laughter]
G: I mean its really
Voice: But the really poor people, maybe theyre enlightened in
different ways. They dont get to hear all this and theyll never
G: Yesterday or the day before yesterday, I was approached to fund a
seven billion dollar Euro bond issued by another country, two of them
away from here, so they could build $10,000 homes for their people. You
know, Chavez again. He wants to get the money to build low-income
housing.
So we all have to address these things. How cheap can we have it? And as
long as you make the place, remember the other thing: putting something
together that will survive all this stuff.
Thats your job now, is to research and find out what it takes to build
a low-income house.
Voice: Well, I mean
even then. I dont know. Not everyone in the world
can change all of a sudden and build these new-style houses.
G: They cant?
Voice: Not all of a sudden. I dont think they can. What about the
people living on a dollar a day? Whos going to do that for all of them?
G: They dont. Theyre in trouble. Theyre in major trouble. I mean,
seriously. Im sorry about that, but thats again
Bill Ryan: Whats your positive suggestion?
G: Yeah, we have to have a positive. [to audience] Yes?
Voice: Whos the architect in Cuenca that youre working with?
G: Well, were not
You know, I was bringing down Barry Green out of Las
Vegas. Now Barry - thats not the same name, no relation at all. Hes
built the domes for me. Weve been partners in some of the building, and
hes done a lot of research on doing that.
So I dont have that yet. But, again, in the next couple of weeks Ill
have some telephone numbers and things.
I just got back down here last week. My God, you got to
[inaudible]
[laughter] I mean, this time, it was a year ago, right, Brian? We took a
week when we were just enjoying ourselves trying to get
Well, I did a
lecture in Cuenca the last time, but this is a different format that
theyve sprung on me.
Voice: George, Gary and I
My husband and I have been considering
We
have twenty-eight acres in Cotopachi that were going to build on.
G: Yeah.
Voice: And, as youre talking about this partly underground dome thing,
thats exactly the vision Ive been having. And were talking to an
architect in Cuenca who
Hes Ecuadorian but hes Berkeley trained. Hes
an environmental scientist and landscape architect named Gustavo
Gonzalez. So you might want to
G: Gustavo Gonzalez? You know, Im welcome for all these things. I dont
have all the time to assemble all these things. Ive got other people
around here Im trying to lay it off and let them follow up on it.
I want to give you an overview on what Ive experienced personally. I
mean, I was gung-ho to expose all these people. You know, the very first
thing when I got the whole deal, when I got the Plan 2000, I believed it
and I said: No!
And then I went public.
Voice: Thank you for that.
G: You try to tell people whats going on, but they dont
Most people
dont want to listen.
[to audience] Yes, Arlene?
Arlene: I want to back-track a little bit to the de-population. What was
the criteria for the people that were going to be left? Did they have to
be a certain age or certain income bracket?
G: Yeah. Well, no, theres no income because you wont have any income.
They dont care about that. Here, let me tell you what theyve done.
Their research, and Im sitting here looking at it; again, its logic.
Most people work about the best they can up until about age 44. So 44
was the date that they cut off.
Using their research, thats the most productive youve had, up to that
age. From 44 on, youre downhill.
Now, let me give you a better
From the actuary standpoint, of every 100
people who start out in life at age 25, by the time you get to 100, one
out of three are dead. Did you know that? 30%... basically 30%.
If you
look back at your classmates, how many are gone?
Voices: A lot.
G: Anyway, the age 44 deal? You will be allowed to exist if you have a
talent that they can use. If youre not doing anything that they can use
right now, youll be eliminated.
Voice: Based also on that, is the government going to cut off money?
Because people still need a little bit of money, like Social Security.
G: There will be no Social Security!
Voice: No Social Security, no Medicare, no programs?
G: There wont
These last four months, theyve cut down Medicare
already! Theyre cutting it down. Theyre cutting down the people who go
into the V.A. hospitals. Theyre cutting down all of the benefits.
Right now in Ecuador, to give you an idea, the TAME pilots have two
jobs. Did you know that? One of them, theyre military pilots, and then
they work part-time being pilots on TAME.
And the government just last month says by, this is April 1st, they will
no longer be able to do that A) unless they speak English, and they
cant have two jobs.
[to audience] Yeah, Dana?
Dana: What are some of the qualities that theyre looking for if youre
over 44? [laughter]
G: I know that engineers and scientists and stuff will be able to have
jobs.
Voice: Well watch the right movies and well get it figured out.
[laughter]
G: I dont know if theres any right thing or not. I was very upset when
I started looking at it, and then, you know, Im listening to the
governor and he said: Well I got my ticket. And nobody talked to me
about any ticket. [laughter and audience comments] So, obviously Im not
one of the ones thats going to be around. Right?
Voice: Its my opinion that the remedy to all of this comes to spiritual
identity. Im curious what your thoughts are on the concepts of spirit
and soul. Is there a difference? Or what your thoughts are.
G: We briefly talked
The question was: Whats the difference between
the spirit and the soul? This is a good question.
My understanding is that the spirit within ourselves, if you want to
look at our soul, is this conglomeration of thought that has accumulated
at this point from the creation. Its located at the bottom part of your
heart and its a hydrogen conglomeration thats holding together all
this thought process.
Now, is it a soul or is it a spirit? Im not too sure.
As you know, I tell everybody, were just nothing more than a spirit
inside this Rent-a-Wreck. Right? Weve designed this outside body to
maintain it all, and the outside body is being corrupted by everything,
thats all.
So, I dont know if theres really
Thats a question Ill have to find
out. Its nomenclature. What is the soul against the spirit?
I do know that the spirit comes in and does move about. You have
out-of-body experiences. You do all kinds of things. So you have that
ability, and youll stick around for about three days when you get rid
of this body. And thats to allow the collected thought to be continued
on so youre on your soul journey.
Many people have done studies on this, you know, Journey of Soul and
other things that are out there but I dont have
I havent
Well, lets put it this way: They wont let me remember my previous
lives and what I did before. And they said on purpose, because the
instructions that I had right now from my previous thing, if I woke up
to who I was, Id cut out of here. I wouldnt be here. [laughter] So, I
volunteered.
[to audience] Yes?
Voice: Do you know who theyre targeting to put into these camps and if
theyre doing it in stages? Like first these people, then these people,
then...
G: No, everybodys going to be lined
Kerry: Actually, were first. [laughter] Yeah. Im being honest with
you. People like George, me, Brian. Were all first.
G: Im not going! [laughter and comments]
K: You know how it is. Theres a saying about that, you know: First they
came and got the communists, then they came and got
Voice: But if youre down here
K: Well, hey! Yeah. Take your chances. Lay your bets and, you know, live
it out the way you see fit, because youre going to be in the right place
at the right time for the experience that you need to have when this all
comes down. And your body is a temporary vehicle so its, you know
Dont get all over-anxious and desperate.
G: The Ecuadorian government - and I talked to them just Friday, or
Thursday, whenever I came down, when I was discussing this situation -
they love Americans that come down because most Americans who are coming
down here are very intelligent, they have a little bit of money and
theyre creating jobs for other Ecuadorians and theyre making things
better.
And they wont allow Colombians, for instance, to come over here, and
they wont allow people from Peru to come up here either. So theyre
kind of watching to keep everything, as much as they can.
[to audience] Yes?
Voice: Say for example, the people were successful and overwhelmed the
elites. The world would still be over-populated. How would you deal with
that?
G: Youre not going to overwhelm them because
Howre you going
to do it?
Voice: Well, just hypothetically.
G: I dont know what you could do, if you could overwhelm all the people
on top. Theres always
Unfortunately, society is always dog-eat-dog if
youre moving yourself up to the top.
To give you an idea how it works in Washington: I was in Washington, DC,
inside the Beltway. You know: The District of Criminals? DC? [laughter]
Anyhow, I was in there talking to them, and I said: Well, weve got a
new crack at this - this change in the government again, like whats
going on right now. In other words, we have a whole bunch of new people
that are taking offices.
It is a requirement now in the government that when they come in there,
the people that come in have to hire the employees underneath that have
already been there. So all were doing is changing the anthill, were
just changing the people on the top.
The corruption is clear on down. So, yeah, we can get rid of everybody
on top, but the whole anthills corrupt. Where do they get their money?
Theyre going to protect their jobs! People will do that. They want
their income protected.
Well, the incomes going away, too, so were going to have mass chaos in
the streets, especially in the UK, where youre from
Well, youre
already starting.
Voice: May I ask a question, George?
G: Yes.
Voice: I speak as a South American that speaks Spanish, and a lot of
people speak Spanish, beginning in Mexico, down all the way to Tierra
del Fuego. And I feel that all of this information is very valuable.
Would you know of any source that is already translated into Spanish so
we could convey?
G: You mean the Handbook and stuff?
Voice: Yes.
G: Well, last time I was down here I talked to a group in
Do you know
Judy?
Voice: Judy?
G: That girl up in Cuenca that has
kind of like Rob, if you look at it
Anyway, I gave them the books and nobody has done it, because it isnt a
translatable work. I have computers that can do that.
Voice: We have a volunteer.
G: You do?
Voice: Ill do it.
G: Have you got the books? What we have to have
We can translate it.
Its not just the words, its the meaning.
Voice: I know.
G: Thats the hard part, but if you can translate it, Ive got people
out there who would immediately put it in print. Ill put it up on the
internet so you can have it. Look, Im not out here to make money on
these things, guys.
Voice: Just say so.
K: OK.
Camelot has an interview with George that hes telling everything
he told here, basically. And we have whats called transcripts already
in Spanish on our site.
G: Oh, do you?
K: Yes.
G: Oh great!
Voice: And this is even more information thats already there.
Voice: OK. What site was that?
G: No, I want you
If youve got the information, Id like to have it so
I can put it
Its the same thing
K: ProjectCamelot.org
G: Id like to have them and well print them. OK?
K: But you also have had, you know, given speeches which were translated
and you have the audio on that. Right?
G: Um
Some. But a lot of other languages
Theyve already translated it
into Portuguese and they did it into
I dont know. Theres a lot of
other languages thats coming down.
I put the French ones up on the site. You probably saw that there in
French. We get Demers up in Canada whos done that.
But people have to have that spirit on the inside that says: Oh, this is
my job to help. You know, I cant speak all this stuff and do it in the
meaning thats there.
But Id appreciate it if you could do that. Just contact me and well
get it out. Well get it printed and well compare it. Well have the
comparison with the one that you have up there.
K: Sure.
G: [to audience] Yes?
Voice: Another thing that could help, that could also be posted on the
website is if you would make a list of the top 20 websites that you
think are powerful. And we could circulate that and everybody could just
put a check against the ones that they see. Then we could see among us
which websites people are finding the most helpful. Then you could put
it up on Project Camelot, too.
G: Well, I think youve done some of that. I mean, in the United States
a lot of people go to
well, your sites going on there.
ConsciousMediaNetwork.com is there.
Voice: Rense.com.
G: Yeah, Rense.com. Jeff puts up with his stuff. He has the daily stuff
on there all the time.
[to audience] Yes, Maam.
Voice: George, just one thing: Whats your information about CIA
influence here and in Latin America generally? And the influences of The
Powers That Be?
G: Rather than give you that - John Perkins latest book
(Confessions of An Economic Hit Man). Who in here
has John Perkins book?
Voice: I have it.
G: You have it? Whats the name of the title?
Voice: I cant remember. [laughter]
G: Well, its in my catalog.
Voice: Actually, Ive got the catalog.
Brian OLeary (B): Ive got it downstairs in the library.
G: He hasnt got it here, but it gives you all of the CIA stuff, even
including Ecuador stuff. My CIA guys
You know, the CIA is really crazy. I mean I sat with my CIA buddy whos
in charge of Latin America, and we went in the Russian Embassy and the
guys were freely taking on the former KGB. Theyre sitting there talking
back and forth with each other and theyre all in the same camp. Theres
no difference between them, when you look at it. So the CIA is
definitely here.
Correa, the president here now, is looking into the influence and trying
to get rid of the people up here that are trying to manipulate this
country. So thats good. Theyre doing that right now.
Voice: The Manta base is going or is gone? Or whats the story there?
G: About what?
Voice: There was an American base in Manta. Air Force. Whats going on
with that?
G: I dont know. I havent followed that.
Voice: I can address that.
G: Pardon? Theres someone in the back that can answer your question on
that.
BO'L: Uh, I can address that.
G: He can
Theres a man over here in front that can address that.
[laughter] Lets let this man talk.
BO'L: Yeah, umm, to my way of thinking, and Ive been following these
things very closely as Pondoz, our resident-elder aging-hippie
news-service. Weve been monitoring these things very carefully, and
also Ive had a few interactions with the government myself, mostly on
the environmental issues.
But Correa has done some, I think, really remarkable things. This
country politically has come a long way since the previous
administrations, which were almost always evicted by the banging of pots
in front of the presidential palace [laughter], because they became very
corrupted.
Usually they were junta leader-types like the previous one, Gutierrez.
All he had to do was spend twenty minutes in the Oval Office with Bush
to completely change his mind and not go for the indigenous rights, but
instead pocket a tremendous amount of money in corruption, and so forth.
Correa was elected and has done the following: He has evicted the U.S.
Air Force. Its the only U.S. Air Force base in all of South America,
the Manta Air Force Base.
The lease is up this year, later this year, and he did not renew it. In
fact, his response to the possible renewal of it is to say: Well, Ill
renew it if you let Ecuador have an Air Force base in Miami. [laughter]
Well, the U.S. didnt go along with that.
And then there have been several other things that hes done that were
very positive. There was a constituent assembly.
Theyve come up with a
new constitution, one of whose provisions is that Nature has rights,
which is a wonderful provision if its enforced.
