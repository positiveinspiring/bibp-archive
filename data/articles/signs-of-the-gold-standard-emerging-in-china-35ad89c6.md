To get rich is glorious.
- Deng Xiaoping
As noted
in last weeks column about the rising recognition by authorities in
Germany about the virtues of gold,
the gold standard is receiving impressive
new recognition internationally.
The GOP plank calling for a commission to
study possible ways to set a fixed value for the dollar - with an
unmistakable nod to gold - is the most prominent element of the 2012 GOP
platform still being heard to reverberate around the world.
Meanwhile, it continues to gain impressive
momentum in the United States.
CNNs Kevin Voigt writes, in The
China Post, Currencies:
Re-evaluating the ghost of gold:
One platform of the recent U.S. Republican
National Convention that, ultimately, could reverberate around the world
is a plan to study a possible return of the U.S. to the gold standard.
While it was perceived as a move to appease
the partys extreme right wing, economists like Mundell think the world
needs a limited return to the gold standard.
This is by no means an isolated blip on the
economic radar screen of China watchers.
As Christopher Potter, president of
Northern Border Capital Management, so astutely observed in a column
entitled Chinas
Preparing for the End Game - Are We Paying Attention, published in
The Lehrman Institutes TheGoldStandardNow.org
- which Potter advises (and this columnist professionally edits):
-
China is
increasing its monetary gold
reserves at an alarming rate. Five years ago China surpassed the US
in gold production and five years from now it will own more gold
than the US Federal government.
-
China is preparing for a world beyond
the inconvertible paper dollar, a world in which the renminbi,
buttressed by gold, becomes the dominant reserve currency.
-
The Chinese government has recently,
-
removed all restrictions on
personal ownership of gold
-
legalized domestic gold exchange
traded funds
-
is currently purchasing 100% of
domestic gold mine production
-
imported over 750 tons of gold
(27% of global output) in the last 12 months
-
stated publicly its intention to
add 1,000 tons per year to its central bank gold reserves
-
buying major stakes in foreign
gold mining companies
The scale of this initiative is
extraordinary.
-
Commenting on the recently announced
acquisition of African Barrick Gold Ltd. by state-owned China
National, CEO Sun Zhaoxue stated,
-
As gold
is a currency in nature, no matter if its for state
economic security or for the acceleration of renminbi
internationalization, increasing the gold reserve should
be one of the key strategies of China.
This is not the first emergence of authoritative
attention to the power of gold as the monetary unit by China in recent
years.
Wikileaks provided a
notable cable
dated February 8, 2010 sent from the U.S. embassy in Beijing excerpting a
story from Shanghais China Business News that observed:
If we use all of our foreign exchange
reserves to buy U.S. Treasury bonds, then when someday the U.S. Federal
Reserve suddenly announces that the original ten old U.S. dollars are
now worth only one new U.S. dollar, and the new U.S. dollar is pegged to
the gold - we will be dumbfounded.
This implies a preposterous devaluation, which
is not the direction toward which the key gold standard proponents are
progressing.
Golds proponents have no interest in scalding creditors
or
debtors.
A better grasp of the implications of gold is
demonstrated by Zhou Qiren, Dean of Peking Universitys National
School of Development and a member of the Peoples Bank of China Monetary
Policy Committee.
Zhou was interviewed by China
2011 Economy staff reporter Ye Weikian last year.
Q; Proposals to go back to the gold
standard are now reappearing. Do you think this is feasible?
A; If the currency of each major
country is bound to gold, financial headaches would of course be
reduced. Taking QE2 as an example, if this were the 1880s, the
currencies of the major western countries would be measured in gold.
Unless the U.S. Treasury suddenly gained a
large quantity of gold reserves, it would be impossible for (U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben) Bernanke to print US$ 600 billion to
purchase long-term debt.
If there is a commitment to a gold standard
system, such as the
Bretton Woods system in place until 1971,
the
FED
could not easily ease its monetary policy, because not only could each
country with dollar holdings hold them accountable, they could also
redeem their dollars for gold to see how much Uncle Sams promise is
worth.
A gold standard also would eliminate
exchange rate wars. Since all major currencies could be exchanged for
gold or other currencies pegged to a currency that follows the gold
standard, exchange rates would remain stable without anyone doing
anything.
Where would exchange rate disputes come
from? In short, the gold standard would effectively prevent each
countrys government from recklessly levying inflation taxes
domestically and passing troubles to others by manipulating currency
exchange internationally.
Of course, this is an excellent monetary
system.
Dean Zhou presented, later in the interview, as
pessimistic about the political possibilities of implementing the gold
standard. He shouldnt be.
Respected figures from the United States are now
taking a more forward leaning stance in growing recognition of golds
potential significance. Joint Economic Committee Vice Chairman Kevin
Brady addressed the Prosperity Caucus on September 19th in
Washington DC.
He alerted the Caucus to the significant and
rapidly growing support for
the Sound Dollar Act.
This columnist has termed that bill, sponsored
in the Senate by Sen. Mike Lee, the most important monetary reform
legislation in 40 years.
The Sound Dollar Act isnt the gold
standard. Yet it is widely seen as a major step toward creating a process
to enable the reform of American monetary policy to a rule-based
one. Furthermore, the Sound Dollar act is well designed to provide a
context in which official reconsideration of which rule - the Taylor Rule or
the classical gold standard - is, empirically considered, the better
foundation for American monetary policy.
The day after Rep. Bradys address Rep. Ron
Paul held what likely will prove his final hearing as chairman of the
House Domestic Monetary Policy subcommittee.
Its purpose was to review the economic
distortions caused by artificial manipulation of interest rates by the
FED. The hearing featured two of the leading proponents of what could be
called the American Principle gold standard: journalist/belle-lettrist
James Grant and financier/philanthropist Lewis Lehrman.
Both Grant and Lehrman outlined the severe
problems that the FEDs central planning of our financial system are
causing.
Rather than focusing on the fiendish problems
caused by paper money, Lehrman extolled the dignity and moral heroism of Ron
Paul for keeping the issue of monetary reform alive and concluded:
Now we are able to formulate an authentic,
bipartisan program to restore 4 percent American economic growth over
the long term
[T]hese reforms can be made effective for America and the
world by a modernized gold standard and stable exchange rates.
The most riveting political commercial of the
2010 election cycle was an independent expenditure by Citizens Against
Government Waste entitled Why do great nations fail? - generally known as
the Chinese Professor.
It portrays a Chinese Professor, in Beijing
2030, attacking Obamas profligate spending policies and the debts America
incurred. It concludes, to the laughter of the audience, and now they work
for us, and received millions of YouTube views.
Chinese mercantilist policies are beginning to
emerge as a subject of the 2012 presidential race. Rather than engaging in a
blame - and maybe trade - war, however, a more optimistic possibility is
emerging: the gold standard.
The road to the restoration of harmony, and
mutual prosperity, is becoming the subject of renewed recognition both in
China and America (as well,
as noted last week, in Germany both by Deutsche Bank and the Bundesbank
president Jens Weidmann).
The classical gold standard, conjoined with
other free market policies, offers the very real, very attractive,
possibility of renewed worldwide prosperity.
To quote one of the great supply-siders of
modern history, Deng Xiaoping:
致富光荣: To get rich is glorious.
There is a dawning recognition, the hilariously
reactionary Paul Krugman notwithstanding, that the road to prosperity
is paved with gold.
