# WikiLeaks - Whose Agenda?

Those tracking the agenda now advancing behind
the
WikiLeaks fa√ßade should check for the undisclosed bias among
editors at the four newspapers chosen to select what was leaked.
And when it
was leaked...
The pro-Israeli bias of The New York Times needs no citations. In London,
WikiLeaks releases are overseen by Deputy Editor Ian Katz at The
Guardian.
What about Le Monde in Paris and Der Spiegel in Berlin?
The tipping point for German media dates to 2003 when Haim Saban
purchased ProSiebenSat1, Germany's second largest media conglomerate.
Why this particular acquisition? Because
"Germany is critical to Israel" conceded Steve Rattner, Saban's
investment banker - now under indictment in New York for fraud.
Saban's support was key to putting Angela Merkel in office in 2005.
Thus Netanyahu's comment on November 29th about Germany becoming
Israel's new 'partner for peace' in the Middle East - while Tel Aviv
collapsed U.S.-sponsored peace talks.
On December 10th, Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton chose the Saban Center
at the Brookings Institution in Washington to announce the end of this
latest charade of talks.
Saban has long been close to
the Clintons...
Ex-President Bill Clinton helped
him sell advertising. Though Saban paid for the building now housing the
Democratic National Committee, he is doubtless thrilled that Republican
Congressman
Eric Cantor, a Jewish-Zionist, will
take the reins in January as House Majority Leader.
Both political parties are critical to Israel.
Entropy - Again
The collapse of peace talks marked the success of yet another Israeli
entropy strategy.
When negotiating with Zionists, the relevant
question is always:
What's Next From Israel - Entropy or Outrage?
Take your pick:
perpetual delay or another
well-timed provocation. Or both...
In 2007, Haim Saban, a self-described
Zionist, acquired control of
Univision, the
most popular U.S. media outlet for Latinos.
As America's fastest-growing
voting bloc, their support is also critical to Israel. This latest
acquisition confirms the systematic imbedding of pro-Israeli influence in
opinion-shaping domains, including media, think tanks and politics.
Israel is waging war on the U.S. by way of deception. That strategy can only
succeed if this war is waged in plain sight by its adept
game theory war planners.
Tel Aviv's agenda requires a critical mass of control over key "in between"
domains - between "the mark" (that's us) and the facts that We The People
require for a system of governance reliant on our informed consent.
The modus operandi on display at every turn: displacement of facts with
false beliefs.
Thus the role of media, think tanks and pro-Israeli policy-makers in selling
Americans on consensus beliefs around,
-
Iraqi WMD
-
Iraqi ties to Al Qaeda
-
Iraqi meetings with Al Qaeda in Prague
-
Iraqi mobile biological weapons
laboratories
-
Iraqi uranium from Niger...
All were false yet all were widely
believed.
The entirety of the phony intelligence that induced the U.S. to invade Iraq
is traceable to Israeli or pro-Israeli sources. The invasion was marketed to
a trusting American public by a mainstream media dominated by those sharing
the same undisclosed bias.
In the Information Age, if that's not treason, what is?
With Friends Like
This
When in human history were fabricated beliefs first deployed to deceive?
At the heart of this ancient craft one finds
proponents of the oldest of the three "religions of the book" promoting a "Clash" between its two derivatives:
Christianity and Islam.
Displacement is the key to this mental and emotional manipulation. Within
hours of WikiLeak's November release of diplomatic cables, peace talks were
displaced by renewed talk of
war with Iran. WikiLeaks concedes it had
those cables since May.
Barack
Obama has no better grasp of this long-running treachery than
George Bush, Bill Clinton, G.H.W. Bush, Reagan, Carter, Ford,
Nixon, Johnson, Kennedy, Eisenhower, Truman, FDR, Coolidge, Harding or
Wilson.
Only with clarity on the common source of this duplicity can a
long-deceived global public ensure accountability for the many conflicts
engineered by those skilled at pitting two sides against the middle while
profiting off the misery of both.
By wielding their influence in key in-between domains, those complicit prey
on the good faith of others. We Americans will remain unwitting players in a
fabricated drama (The Clash of Civilizations) so long as we believe a
narrative sustained in plain sight by those skilled at deception.
To betray, one must first befriend; to deceive, one must first create a
relationship of trust. No one can persuade Americans to forfeit their
freedom. We must be induced to freely embrace the forces that, step-by-step,
displace our freedom. That's called
Zionism.
To restore the true self to self-governance requires that Americans recover
enough self-confidence to follow facts wherever they may lead. And trust in
themselves enough to act consistent with those facts - despite what those
complicit would deceive them to believe.
Our freedom now depends on it.
