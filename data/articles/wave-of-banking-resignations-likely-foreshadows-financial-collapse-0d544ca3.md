On March 20, 2012, I wrote an article entitled
Worldwide Banking Resignations Triple According To Revised Numbers: Why
Now? which listed the latest banking, CEO, and financial institution
resignations as compiled by independent blog, American Kabuki.
At the time of the writing of that article, the
list of resignations had reached a total of 358.
This was in fact the third article I had written on the subject; the second
being a discussion on the
statistics provided by American Kabuki regarding
the average number of resignations in years past compared to those currently
being announced which, if the information is correct, skyrocketed in late
2011.
In all three of the articles in which I addressed this topic, I ended the
piece by asking the obvious question - Why?
Why are so many bankers, board members, and CEOs suddenly resigning from
their posts? More specifically, why are they resigning now?
Unfortunately, as of this writing, these questions remain unanswered. In
fact, there is not even a hint as to why this mass exodus is occurring.
Nevertheless, let us briefly consider a few possibilities.
Initially, one might suspect that these individuals, acting on some sort of
insider information (which they are obviously doing), are exiting the ranks
of institutions that will soon be the focus of a massive investigation by
relevant authorities. One might logically suspect that the rats are jumping
ship to save their own skins which will be all the more in danger if they
remain in their positions when the investigation begins.
However, although this may be one of the first reasons for such resignations
that come to mind, upon further examination, one finds some major holes in
this theory.
For instance, if one has been part of a major crime (as the vast majority of
these institutions have been), it is not likely that the mere prospect of
being retired or employed by another institution would prevent prosecution
once that crime has come to light.
In fact, one might be better served by remaining on board so as to be in an
even better position by which to cover up evidence and confound the
investigators. That is, if one did not think the effort completely hopeless.
Keep in mind, many individuals who were in a
position to provide or deny evidence regarding the record put options on
American Airlines, United Airlines, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter shortly
before 9/11, would not have been able to remain stone silent if they had not
remained in their position so that they could be
deputized during the
investigation.
Of course, if one did find a cover-up to be impossible, it is also likely
that one would resign in protest, being appalled at the corruption
witnessed inside the institution. Yet, with that in mind, it should be noted
that there have been very few protest resignations announced in the latest
wave of departures.
It is almost universally recognized that large banking institutions are rife
with corruption, fraud, and predatory practices.
The 2008 housing crisis is
case in point. Here, large institutions were
intentionally giving loans that
were nothing more than ticking time bombs to recipients whom they knew would
never be able to repay them.
Indeed, it was found that the majority of these
loans
were completely fraudulent from the start with the borrowers being
fooled into accepting them.
Not only that, but the 2008 housing crisis was
merely a smokescreen cover for the larger crisis of derivatives looming
above them - another banker-engineered scam that is threatening to bring
down the world economy at some point in the near future. (See Webster G. Tarpleys excellent book,
Surviving The Cataclysm to understand the full
extent to which derivatives threaten the world economy.)
But it was the
agencies such as the SEC, who are tasked with policing such
behavior, that allowed much of this criminality to continue over and over
for decades. Punishments have been minute where they have been meted out at
all, and the transfer of wealth from the average American to the coffers of
the large international banks has been facilitated by no other institution
more so than the
Federal government.
The Federal Reserve, itself a cartel of private international banks, stood
to gain nothing by acting in the interests of the American people, and they
have acted in obvious knowledge and accordance with this fact.
Therefore, with such massive levels of corruption in every regulatory agency
tasked with policing private banks, it seems there is little concern that a
real, large-scale, investigation with real, large-scale repercussions for
the criminals being investigated will actually occur.
Obviously, if there is
no looming investigation, then our first supposition regarding the
resignations begins to lose its steam.
That is, of course, unless the information provided by individuals like Wilcock and
Benjamin Fulford turns out to be true. Likewise for the
lawsuits filed by Neil Keenan and Joseph Riad.
However, having mentioned the looming derivatives bubble, there is also the
suggestion that many of those resigning are simply bailing out before the
rocket ship they rode to riches crashes back down to earth, taking all of
the little people with it.
Whether it is what now seems to be the foregone conclusion of WW3 in the
Middle East, derivatives, IMF shock therapy, simple default, subversion,
societal unrest, or even natural disasters, one thing is almost for certain
- the house of cards known as the economy is going to fall.
There is little doubt that many of the individuals now cashing in their
chips would be in a position to know when that collapse is coming, and
others may see it coming simply by watching the signs of the times. Whether
its the attitude of Get out while you can, or Our work here is done,
there seems to be a growing trend of aristocrats rushing for the exits while
the rest of us stand around in amazement wondering just what is going on.
But there is also the possibility that the resignation stampede is not a
stampede at all, but something much more orderly. While an economic collapse
seems imminent, perhaps the banking lords are neither abandoning ship nor
rearranging the deck chairs on their sinking vessel -- perhaps they are
simply rearranging the corporate structure.
Perhaps many of those who have recently announced their resignation are not
pulling out of the game entirely, but merely warming the bench for a return
when the next play is called for them. Simply put, what if those who are now
resigning are only waiting to take up new positions in some other
institution?
Going one step further, however; what if, in addition to an economic
collapse, there is also a coming merger that will make some of their current
positions obsolete?
Remember, we have been hearing calls for
world
government structures and
mechanisms of global governance for some time.
Much like the snowballing number of resignations in recent months, we have
also been hearing a flurry of calls for a world banking system that will
control not just world finance but the monetary and fiscal policies of every
nation on the planet.
Of course, I am not claiming that any of these ruminations are definite
answers to why so many resignations have occurred in such a short period. I
am merely presenting some of the more heavily pondered suggestions with
reasons for why they might be true (or not).
The truth is, as I stated earlier, that we simply do not know the reason
why.
At this point, we can only speculate that something significant is
taking shape. Yet the fact is also that, whatever the cause, those resigning
their positions do know the reasons why, even if they only know their own
personal reasons.
This information would likely be very helpful to
those of us who are not part of the elite global cabal.
