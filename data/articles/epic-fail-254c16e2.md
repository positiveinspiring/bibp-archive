PART ONE
23 April 2012
Facts are to the mind what food is to the body.
Edmund Burke
No wonder one third of Americans are obese.
The crap we are shoveling into our bodies is on
par with the misinformation, propaganda and lies that are being programmed
into our minds by government bureaucrats, corrupt politicians, corporate
media gurus, and central banker puppets.
Chief Clinton propaganda mouthpiece, James
Carville, famously remarked during the 1992 presidential campaign that,
Its the economy, stupid.
Clinton was able to successfully convince the
American voters that George Bushs handling of the economy caused the 1991
recession.
In retrospect, it was revealed the economy had been recovering
for months prior to the election. No one could ever accuse the American
people of being perceptive, realistic or critical thinking when it comes to
economics, math, history or distinguishing between truth or lies.
Our government controlled public school system
has successfully dumbed down the populace to a level where they enjoy their
slavery and prefer conscious ignorance to critical thought.
The next six months leading up to the November elections will surely provide
a shining example of the degraded society weve become.
Both parties and their propaganda machines,
SuperPacs, and corporate media sponsors will treat the igadget distracted
masses to hundreds of hours of lies, spin, and vitriol, designed to divert
the public from the fact that both parties act on behalf of the same masters
and have no intention of changing course of the U.S. Titanic to avert the
iceberg dead ahead.
We will be treated to storylines about,
...and of course the economy, stupid...
There are 240 million voting age Americans. About 130 million will likely
vote in the 2012 election based upon recent voter participation results.
This means that 110 million Americans dont give a crap about who runs this
country or theyve come to their senses and realize our votes dont matter.
Between 1840 and 1900 voter participation ranged
between 70% and 82% as Americans took their civic duty seriously and
believed their vote counted.
Since 1913, when the politicians relinquished
control of our currency to a private bank controlled by a small group of
powerful men, voter participation for President has ranged between 49% and
62%. It hasnt surpassed 57% since 1968.
Now that corporations are people and our
candidates are selected by a few rich men, the transformation from a
republic to a corporate fascist state is almost complete. During the coming
interminable political campaign you will hear about jobs until your ears
bleed.
I can guarantee that 98% of the rhetoric will be
false. Neither party wants the American people to understand the truth about
what happened to our economy and jobs over the last 100 years. It has been a
bipartisan screw job and ignoring the facts doesnt change them.
The first fact that cant be ignored is how many Americans are actually
unemployed today.
Here is some truth you wont get from a
politician or media talking head:
-
There are 243 million working age
Americans.
-
There are 142 million employed
Americans.
-
Only 101 million of the employed
Americans are working more than 35 hours per week. This means that
only 41.6% of all working age Americans have a full-time job.
-
According to the government drones at
the BLS, 88 million Americans have chosen to not be in the labor
force - the highest level in U.S. history.
-
The percentage of Americans in the
workforce at 63.8% is the lowest since 1980 and down from a peak of
67.1% in 2000. The difference between these two percentages is 8
million Americans.
-
The BLS reports there are only 12.7
million unemployed Americans in the country, down from 15.3 million
in 2009.
-
The BLS reports the unemployment rate
has dropped from 10% in late 2009 to 8.3% today. Over this time
frame the working age population grew by 5.7 million, while the
number of employed Americans grew by 3.6 million. Only a government
drone could interpret this data and report a dramatic decline in the
unemployment rate.
Any critical thinking human being would examine
the data being reported as fact by our government and regurgitated without
question by the corporate mainstream media and conclude it is false,
misleading and manipulated.
The economy was booming in 2000 and 67.1% of the
working age population were in the labor force. Today the economy is in much
worse shape. More people NEED to work in order to just make ends meet, but
according to the government, 8 million Americans have chosen to not work.
Only an Ivy League economist or CNBC bimbo
pundit would believe such a blatant distortion of reality.
A comparison to prior decades provides all the
evidence you need:
-
In 1980 the working age population was
168 million and the labor force totaled 107 million.
-
By 1990 the working age population grew
by 21 million and the labor force grew by 19 million.
-
By 2000 the working age population grew
by another 23 million and the labor force advanced by 17 million.
-
Since 2000 the working age population
has grown by 30 million, but shockingly the labor force has
supposedly grown by only 12 million.
This data is so twisted that there is absolutely
no doubt the Federal Government is purposely manipulating the numbers to
make the economic situation appear better than the reality.
During the Great Depression propaganda and spin
had not been perfected. There werent multiple definitions of unemployment
designed to confuse and mislead the public. The peak level of unemployment
in the 1930s was 25%.
The current reported level is 8.3%. On a
comparable basis to the 1930s, including short-term discouraged workers,
those forced to work part-time, and the long-term discouraged workers which
were defined out of existence in 1994 by the BLS, the real unemployment rate
is 22% today.
It feels like a depression for millions of
Americans because it is a depression.
The rhetoric from the Obama administration about
a jobs recovery is laughable.
Full time employment peaked in July 2007 at
122.4 million. Today there are 113.9 million people classified as full-time,
with only 101.3 million working more than 35 hours. There are 8.5 million
fewer people with full time jobs today than there were in 2007.
That fact is even more disheartening considering
the working age population has grown by 10.5 million over the same time
span. Taking an even longer term view provides the perspective needed to
assess our true economic state.
Total nonfarm employment hasnt grown in twelve
years, while the working age population has grown by 30 million people.
Obama will tout the fact that weve added 3.6
million jobs since the bottom of this recession.
What he wont tout is that hiring of temporary
workers surged by 37% and accounted for 25% of all the jobs added since
2009. Im sure these temporary workers, with no health or retirement
benefits, are confident about their future.
The facts about jobs and employment are
consistent with the 47 million Americans on food stamps (up from 35 million
when the recession supposedly ended). Its a sure sign of recovery when
spending on food stamps doubles in the last two years.
No depression here, just move along.
Record numbers of Americans being added to the
SSDI rolls for depression and other illusory disabilities is surely a
positive development pointing to a strong economic recovery.
In just the first four months of this year,
539,000 joined the disability rolls and more than 725,000 put in
applications.
We see a lot of people applying for
disability once their unemployment insurance expires, said Matthew
Rutledge, a research economist at Boston Colleges Center for Retirement
Research.
The number of applications last year was up 24%
compared with 2008, Social Security Administration data show. Why
participate in the labor market when you can collect a government check for
life because you are obese or depressed.
These are the people no longer in the labor
force. Once they go on SSDI, they rarely go back to work again.
The government reported figure of 12.7 million
unemployed Americans is an utter falsehood. There are in excess of 30
million Americans that are either unemployed or working part-time that want
full-time jobs.
Government propaganda doesnt change the facts.
Facts dont cease to exist because they
are ignored.
Aldous Huxley
Would You Like a Side
Order of Facts with That Propaganda?
When you watch the Wall Street scam artists paraded on CNBC declaring the
number of people not in the labor force is going up due to Baby Boomers
retiring, you should understand they are propagating a falsehood.
They are either intellectually dishonest or too
lazy to do the most basic of research. They are paid millions to impart
false storylines to anyone dumb enough to watch CNBC expecting facts or a
smattering of truth. If you want some truth, turn to John Mauldin and
John Hussman.
CNBC doesnt invite these outstanding honest
analysts on their station when they can roll out a shill like Abbey Joseph
Cohen or James Paulson. They wouldnt want some factual analysis when they
can have Becky Quick do one of her frequent handjob interviews with that
doddering old status quo fool Warren Buffet.
A critical thinker might wonder how could real disposable income be dropping
over the last three months and only have risen by 0.3% in the last year if
weve had the strong job growth touted by Obama. Could it be the jobs being
created are extraordinarily low-paying? There are signs of desperation
everywhere you look.
The two charts below, from one of John Mauldins
recent articles, reveal the truth about the Baby Boomers retiring storyline.
The first chart shows the employment level for those over the age of 55
since 2007.
There were 25.3 million people over the age of
55 working in 2007 and there are 30.1 million working today. People over 55
have seen their total employment level rise by 4.8 million jobs since the
beginning of the recession, and over 3 million jobs since the 3rd quarter of
2009. Total employment is down by 4 million since 2007, while employment
among those over 55 is up 19%.
John Hussman described the reality about
employment in his recent weekly article:
If you dig into the payroll data, the
picture that emerges is breathtaking. Since the recession ended in
June 2009, total non-farm payrolls in the U.S. have grown by 2.32
million jobs. However, if we look at workers 55 years of age and over,
we find that employment in that group has increased by 3.04 million
jobs.
In contrast, employment among workers under
age 55 has actually contracted by nearly one million jobs, regardless of
which survey you use. Even over the past year, the vast majority of job
creation has been in the 55-and-over group, while employment has been
sluggish for all other workers, and has already turned down.
I wonder how Larry Kudlow will spin this.
Now for the really eye opening facts.
While the labor participation rate has been
plunging, the Boomer participation rate has been skyrocketing. The
participation rate for the over 65 age group is now at an all-time high.
Do you think this has anything to do with home
values dropping 36% since 2005, gasoline prices doubling since early 2009,
food prices surging by 25%, the 1.4% annual return of stocks since 1999, or
the 0,15% senior citizens can earn on their money today versus the 5% they
could earn in 2007?
Intellectually dishonest ultra-liberal Ivy
League defender of
the Federal Reserve-Paul Krugman,
had this to say about Ben Bernankes zero interest rate policy on senior
citizens:
Finally, how is expansionary monetary
policy supposed to hurt the 99 percent? Think of all the people living
on fixed incomes, were told. But who are these people? I know the
picture: retirees living on the interest on their bank account and their
fixed pension check - and there are no doubt some people fitting that
description. But there arent many of them.
It must be comforting living in an ivory tower
or penthouse suite and looking down upon the ignorant masses while caressing
your Nobel Prize.
The millions of senior citizens with $100,000 of
savings could earn $5,000 of interest income in 2007 to supplement their
$18,000 of Social Security income. Today, they can earn $150 while the Wall
Street banks receive the benefits of ZIRP by borrowing for free from the
Federal Reserve and earning billions risk free.
Paulie doesnt think the $4,850 reduction in
income and the 15% increase in inflation since 2007 had a negative impact on
senior citizens. They must be pouring into the work force because they are
just bored, after working for the last 45 years.
John Hussman has a slightly different
viewpoint, based upon facts rather than a false disproven ideology:
Beginning first with Alan Greenspan, and
then with Ben Bernanke, the Fed has increasingly pursued policies of
suppressing interest rates, even driving real interest rates to negative
levels after inflation.
Combine this with the bursting of two
Fed-enabled (if not Fed-induced) bubbles - one in stocks and one in
housing, and the over-55 cohort has suffered an assault on its financial
security: a difficult trifecta that includes the loss of interest
income, the loss of portfolio value, and the loss of home equity.
All of these have combined to provoke a
delay in retirement plans and a need for these individuals to re-enter
the labor force.
In short, what weve observed in the employment figures is not recovery,
but desperation. Having starved savers of interest income, and having
repeatedly subjected investors to Fed-induced financial bubbles that
create volatility without durable returns, the Fed has successfully
provoked job growth of the obligatory, low-wage variety. Over the past
year, the majority of this growth has been in the 55-and-over cohort,
while growth has turned down among other workers.
Meanwhile, broad labor force participation
continues to fall as discouraged workers leave the labor force entirely,
which is the primary reason the unemployment rate has declined.
All of this reflects not health, but
despair, and helps to explain why real disposable income has grown by
only 0.3% over the past year.
Do you believe Krugman or Hussman?
The key takeaway from the data is the
desperation exhibited by average Americans, while the political governing
elite and Wall Street pigs continue to gorge themselves at the trough of
free money provided by the Federal Reserve, while paying themselves obscene
bonuses for a job well done buying the corrupt Washington politicians.
Over the next six months we will hear unceasing
rhetoric from Obama and Romney about how they are going to create jobs.
Neither of these government apparatchiks have a
clue about jobs or desire to change the course that was set one hundred
years ago with the creation of the Federal Reserve. Obama never worked at a
real job in his entire life, while Romney has spent his life firing people
and spinning off heavily indebted companies to unsuspecting investors.
The current deteriorating jobs picture has been
decades in the making and a truly bipartisan effort.
The rhetoric about America being an engine of
growth and the world leader in innovation and entrepreneurship is laughable
when examined with a critical eye. We are an aging empire living in the past
as the facts portray an entirely different reality.
Our fastest growing industries include:
-
Solar panel manufacturing (subsidized by
your tax dollars)
-
For-profit universities (diploma mills
subsidized by your tax dollars)
-
Pilates and yoga studios
-
Self-tanning product manufacturing
-
Social network game development
-
Hot sauce production
The surge in jobs in the last three months is
being driven by these industries:
-
Food services and drinking places
-
Administrative and support services
-
Ambulatory health care services
-
Credit intermediation
-
Hospitals
Is this the picture of a world leading jobs
machine or a delusional, paper pushing, self-involved, obese, sickly, overly
indebted crumbling empire?
The job openings in industries that actually
produce something are barely identifiable on the chart below. Maybe the
University of Phoenix can successfully retrain construction and
manufacturing workers to be waiters, waitresses, and Wal-Mart greeters if
the Federal government can funnel more of our tax dollars into student
loans.
If you thought low wage work was only for
Chinese, Indians, and Vietnamese, you havent been paying attention.
The United States is a world leader. We are by
far the world leader among developed countries in percentage of low wage
workers at 24.8%. I find it hysterical that the dysfunctional insolvent
countries of Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Italy have a much smaller
percentage of low wage workers than the great American empire. We have 142
million employed Americans and 35 million are slaving away in low paying
thankless jobs.
This explains why the half the workers in the
country make less than $25,000 per year.
The top three employment occupations in the
country are:
There are high paying good jobs in America, but
there arent many and on-line college graduates from the University of
Phoenix arent going to get them.
The highest paying jobs today require a high
level of specialization and education, especially in the healthcare and
technology industries. This disqualifies the vast majority of government run
public school graduates. High paying manufacturing jobs which were the
backbone of the country during the 1950s and 1960s are gone forever.
The reasons for this transformation are
multifaceted and will be addressed in Part Two of this article. It didnt
happen by accident and there are culprits to blame.
The conversion of our country from making high
quality things other countries needed to a debt driven service economy of
paper pushers, hash slingers, and retail specialists has slowly but surely
destroyed the middle class. The masses are distracted by the latest
technological marvel that allows them to waste another two hours per day
posting how they feel about the latest episode of Americas Got Something or
Americas Top Whatever.
We have become a country that glories in our
materialism and shallow culture while acting like a thug around the world
with our unparalleled military machine.
This result is not an accident. It was set in motion by the actions of a
handful of rapacious, wealthy powerful men that have been calling the shots
in this country for the last hundred years. It wasnt a planned conspiracy
but the logical result of man-made inflation, a fiat currency not backed by
gold, the craving of rich men to become richer, a willfully ignorant
populace, and a slow devolution of our society into a corporate fascist
state.
We praise and honor psychopathic criminals while
scorning and ridiculing the middle class workers that built this country.
The American dream has become a nightmare for the millions of unemployed and
underemployed.
The acceleration of debt accumulation and money
printing guarantees this rotting carcass of a country will go belly up in
the foreseeable future.
Thus did a handful of rapacious citizens
come to control all that was worth controlling in America.
Thus was the
savage and stupid and entirely inappropriate and unnecessary and
humorless American class system created. Honest, industrious, peaceful
citizens were classed as bloodsuckers, if they asked to be paid a living
wage.
And they saw that praise was reserved
henceforth for those who devised means of getting paid enormously for
committing crimes against which no laws had been passed.
Thus the
American dream turned belly up, turned green, bobbed to the scummy
surface of cupidity unlimited, filled with gas, went bang in the noonday
sun.
- Kurt Vonnegut
In Part Two of this article I will examine how
we got to this point and what is likely to happen next.
