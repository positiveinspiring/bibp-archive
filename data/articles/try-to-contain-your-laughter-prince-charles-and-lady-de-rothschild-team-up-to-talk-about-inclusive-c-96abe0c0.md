Lady de Rothschild
Speaks on Bloomberg News
About the Inclusive Capitalism Conference
-
Now that the worldwide Occupy Wall
Street protest movement has been beaten, pepper-sprayed,
mass-arrested and
hog-tied into submission
-
Now that assorted financial luminaries
have exhorted corporate media to stop giving air time to people
calling bankers evil,
...it's now safe for the 1 percent to take over
the debate - or so the thinking goes in London.
Prince
Charles (below video), who lives
in four mansions in England, Scotland and Wales,
delivered the
opening speech yesterday for a conference on "Inclusive Capitalism" hosted
by
Lady de Rothschild, wife of multi-billionaire Sir
Evelyn Robert de
Rothschild, in the heart of financial skullduggery, the
City of London, Wall
Street's alter ego.
Rounding out the day's speakers were,
-
former
President
Bill Clinton, who repealed the
depression era investor protection legislation known as the Glass-Steagall
Act which deregulated Wall Street and is widely blamed for the
2008
financial collapse and for ushering in the greatest wealth inequality in
America since the Gilded Age
-
former Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers who helped Clinton muscle through the deregulatory legislation.
(You can see the
full-day agenda here.)
The lurking undertone of the conference was not
so much a noblesse oblige gesture to spread the wealth as it was an effort
to address the growing anxiety among the well-heeled that if they don't step
up their PR game, government and/or a populist revolution is going to take
the reins - and possibly their heads.
Lady de Rothschild (Lynn Forester) summed up the
anxiety the day before in an interview with Bloomberg News, saying it's,
"really dangerous when business is viewed as
one of society's problems."
She noted further that 61 percent of Britons say
they will elect the party "that is toughest on big business."
The web site of the Inclusive Capitalism
Initiative which sponsored the conference adds this note to explain its
motivations:
"To avoid heavy-handed government
interference in the banking sector, a revolution in management,
supervision and ethics is required."
Fiona Woolf
Lord Mayor of
the City of London
The participants at the conference came from the
same rarefied air as the speakers. It leaked out that the 250 corporate
execs and financial bigwigs who attended the event control $30 trillion in
assets.
Deutsche Welle wrote:
"Time will tell whether the 'Inclusive
Capitalism Initiative' bears any fruits other than more of the sort of
conferences at which extremely wealthy people arrive in private jets to
spend a pleasant few hours together and reassure each other that they're
doing their best for society."
Serving as something of a co-host for the
day-long conference was Fiona Woolf, the Mayor of the City of London who
goes by the 12th Century title, "Lord Mayor."
(Watching a partial web cast of the proceedings
was akin to sitting through an animated children's fairytale set in the 12th
Century with repetitions of Prince, Lord and Lady tumbling off everyone's
lips.)
Prior to her Lord Mayor-ship, Woolf was a
partner at the 3,000 lawyer-strong law firm of CMS Cameron McKenna, which
has a heavy presence in finance and banking.
Woolf sounded absolutely dazzled with
anticipation when she wrote at the Huffington Post yesterday:
"Today, I am hosting one of the most
star-studded gatherings of recent times at the City's Mansion House.
Economic and political luminaries from across the globe are attending
"
("Star-studded" and "inclusive" do not
immediately spring to mind as synonyms.)
Could it be any more fitting for the first half
of the day's events to be held in a place called "Mansion House" - a
Palladian mansion whose first stone was laid in 1739 and which regularly
hosts grand dinners for 250 guests on the taxpayers' dime.
The mansion
serves as both residence and office for the Lord Mayor of the City of London
who functions as a roving goodwill ambassador for financial interests in
London.
According to the official web site, the Lord
Mayor, as a,
"dedicated ambassador, supporting and
promoting the City as the world leader in international finance and
business services, the Lord Mayor travels extensively, in liaison with
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, fostering goodwill and boosting
British trade, particularly the markets and services of the City."
Christine Lagarde,
Managing
Director, IMF
Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of
the International Monetary Fund, also addressed the conference but,
apparently, hadn't gotten the memo about not calling the bankers evil.
Lagarde noted that,
"the most recent poll conducted by the
Edelman Trust Barometer, for example, showed that less than a fifth of
those surveyed believed that governments or business leaders would tell
the truth on an important issue."
Lagarde also made the following points:
"Since 1980, the richest 1 percent increased
their share of income in 24 out of 26 countries for which we have data.
"In the US, the share of income taken home by
the top one percent more than doubled since the 1980s, returning to where it
was on the eve of the Great Depression. In the UK, France, and Germany, the
share of private capital in national income is now back to levels last seen
almost a century ago.
"The 85 richest people in the world, who could
fit into a single London double-decker, control as much wealth as the
poorest half of the global population - that is 3.5 billion people."
Mark Carney,
Head of the Bank
of England, Speaking on Inclusive Capitalism
The final speaker of the evening was the head of
the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who brought up those pesky issues of
rigged markets (which in effect are part of an institutionalized wealth
transfer system).
Carney said:
"In recent years, a host of scandals in
fixed income, currency and commodity markets have been exposed.
Merely
prosecuting the guilty to the full extent of the law will not be
sufficient to address the issues raised. Authorities and market
participants must also act to re-create fair and effective markets."
Prosecuting the guilty to the full extent of the
law? That's a very novel idea on this side of the pond...
