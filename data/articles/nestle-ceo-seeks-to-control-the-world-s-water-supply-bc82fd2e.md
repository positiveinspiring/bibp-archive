Gun control may be a hot topic, but what about water control?
Recent comments from Nestle CEO
Peter Brabeck
imply that the world's water will soon come under the control of
corporations like his. Brabeck makes the astonishing claim that water is not
a human right, but should be managed by business people and governing
bodies.
He wants water controlled, privatized, and delegated in a way that
sustains the planet.

Water control hitting the United States
All of this means that Brabeck's future plans include monitoring and
controlling the amount of water people use.
One day, cities and towns may be
forced by international law to limit each household to a set amount of
water. People may have to obtain permits to dig wells or pay fines for
collecting rainwater. Laws like these are already in motion in the United
States.

rainwater now illegal in many states as Big Government claims ownership over
our water".
Nestle's CEO thinks all water should have a price
In the interview, Brabeck touts that his company is the largest foodstuff
corporation in the world with over $65 billion in profit each year. He
proudly claims that millions of people are dependent on him and his company.
Does this guy think he is a god?
He calls water a "foodstuff" that needs an assigned value. Who controls the
price of water? Brabeck bases his sustainability projects on the fact that a
third of the world's population may face water shortages within 15-20 years.
By price controlling water, Brabeck believes he may save the planet from
food and water shortages in the coming years.
-
With the threat of future water shortages, is it necessary to strip all
humans of their natural liberty to water, as Brabeck suggests?
-
What might happen if international controls are placed on water sources as a
select few corporate dictators rule over the water supply?
-
Can a free and thriving people find better ways to conserve and respect
water with their own liberty, rather than allow global corporations to
control it?
Nestle CEO applauds GMO farming and criticizes organic practices
Putting a person like Brabeck in control of water would create a tyrannical
monopoly on something that was meant to be free.
If influential corporations
put a lock on the water tap, then they could dictate which farms received
water. Nestle could protect GMO farming. In fact, in the interview, Brabeck
said organic food is "not the best" and he went on to say that genetically
modified food is perfectly safe and causes no disease.
With this philosophy,
a Brabeck economy would cut off organic farming from the water supply and
allow genetically modified food to reign over the people.
Working together to preserve our right to water
Free people everywhere must work together to preserve their natural right to
water.
If one wants to dig their own well and tap the ground water, so be
it. They are responsible for their keep. If one wants to collect their own
rain water to sustain their own garden, then so be it. If one wants to
purify their own water trough charcoal gravity fed filters and ditch bottled
water companies altogether, then they will be better off for doing so.
Is it
time to reject a bottled water industry that is brainwashing people to
submit to price controlled water?
Humans can self sustain and work together,
managing their own water. Greedy corporate CEOs are not the answer. No one
is dependent on them. Water should remain unadulterated, free and available
as a right to all.

Nestle CEO Says...
Water Isn't A Human Right

Water Theft
In a candid interview for the documentary
We Feed the World, Nestle CEO Peter Brabeck makes the astonishing claim that water isn't a human right.
He
attacks the idea that nature is good, and says it is a great achievement
that humans are now able to resist nature's dominance. He attacks organic
agriculture and says genetic modification is better.
Nestle is the world's biggest bottler of water. Brabeck claims - correctly -
that water is the most important raw material in the world. However he then
goes on to say that privatization is the best way to ensure fair
distribution. He claims that the idea that water is a human right comes from
extremist NGOs. Water is a foodstuff like any other, and should have a
market value.
He believes that the ultimate social responsibility of any CEO is to make as
much profit as possible, so that people will have jobs.
And just to underline what a lovely man he is, he also thinks we should all
be working longer and harder.
Consequences of water
privatization
The consequences of water
privatization have been devastating on poor
communities around the world.
In South Africa, where the municipal workers'
union SAMWU fought a long battle against privatization, there has been
substantial research about the effects (see "The
Age of Commodity - Water Privatization in Southern Africa").
Water privatization lead to a
massive
cholera outbreak in Durban in the year 2000.
The Nestle boycott
Nestle already has a very bad reputation among activists.
There has been a
boycott call since 1977. This is due to
Nestl√©'s aggressive lobbying to get
women to stop breastfeeding - which is free and healthy - and use infant
formula (sold by Nestle) instead. Nestle has lobbied governments to tell
their health departments to promote formula.
In poor countries, this has
resulted in the deaths of babies, as women have mixed formula with
contaminated water instead of breastfeeding.
Tell Nestle they are wrong - water is a human right
There is Europe-wide campaign to tell the European Commission that water is
a human right, and to ask them to enact legislation to ensure this is
protected.
