# Anonymous' Controversial Message about Donald Trump - The Truth about War 
and Conflict

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_trump30.htm

Anonymous has come
out with a new video on their YouTube channel bringing attention to
the recent events taking place as a result of Trump's call to attack
Syria, which was based on intel his administration received about
Assad's apparent chemical weapons attack on his own people - an
event for which we know there is no evidence.
Things have moved
forward quickly, with military activity increasing around Europe as
tensions continue to build. North Korea has also entered the
picture, as their relationship with the U.S. becomes increasingly
strained.
While no attack has yet broken out, many worry one
is imminent.
What to Consider
War is a big
business and has been used by the elite cabal for many years to not
only take over nations but also control the masses with fear.
The cabal is
typically always pushing for war, and while it may appear to be a
fight between countries, it's not.
It's
often a collaborative effort between powerful individuals to play
out big picture plans by creating conflict at various levels within
a country to justify war.
"I served in all commissioned
ranks from a second Lieutenant to a Major General. And during
that time, I spent most of my time being a high-class muscle man
for Big Business, for Wall Street, and for the bankers.
In short, I was a racketeer for
capitalism."
General Smedley
Butler, one of the
highest ranking generals in American History
At the moment,
everyone is pointing the finger at Trump, which they should given
what he has said on TV and the actions the U.S. has taken under his
'control.'
An interesting
thing to note that has to be shared given the discussion I've had
with insiders is:
Trump's
administration has been receiving cooked intel about what's
happening in other areas of the world from members of the cabal
- in other words, it has been infiltrated.
That being said,
who knows if he's receiving the right information or not?
We know for certain
that a
secret government, for lack of a better term, is really
calling most of the shots. Not many presidents have had the nerve to
oppose these governments, let alone create awareness of them.
Eisenhower did it
when
he warned us about the military industrial complex,
JFK did it
when he mentioned that there are those who want to capitalize on
nationalism to push topics under the rug, and how national security
would be "seized upon" by those who want to conceal information from
the American public.
Trump's campaign
and his promises were largely against the ruling cabal and although
Trump is not the knight in shining armor with a deep conscious
knowing we are all hoping for, he came onto the scene as a non cabal
'leader' that has the opportunity to start dismantling the way
things are done.
This of course is
part of a much bigger picture shift going on where
humanities
consciousness is shifting.
John F. Hylan, the Mayor
of New York City from 1918-1925, referenced this secret government,
saying that it is the,
"real menace of
our Republic," and that "like a giant octopus" it "sprawls its
slimy legs over our cities, states and nation."
He went on to
emphasize how,
"the little
coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the
United States government for their own selfish purposes" and
that "they practically control both parties" as well as "all the
newspapers and magazines in this country."
Here's another
great quote from former President Theodore Roosevelt:
Political
parties exist to secure responsible government and to execute
the will of the people.
From these
great tasks both of the old parties have turned aside. Instead
of instruments to promote the general welfare, they have become
the tools of corrupt interests which use them impartially to
serve their selfish purposes.
Behind the
ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government
owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the
people.
To destroy this
invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between
corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the
statesmanship of the day.

What Does War Really
Show Us?
It's great to see
that more people have become aware of
false flag terrorism.
In fact, other
world leaders are bringing this up with regards to actions the
U.S. takes overseas.
Here's
an article recently published about that, where you can learn exactly what
this phenomenon means. But, as mentioned
above, war isn't really what we've been made to believe it is.
We are, in a sense,
coaxed into accepting it.
That's exactly what false flag terrorism
is all about.
"The statesmen will invent cheap
lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and
every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities,
and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any
refutations of them.
And
thus he will by and by convince himself the war is just, and
will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process
of grotesque self-deception."
Mark Twain

A couple of years
ago, the Dalai Lama put it perfectly after the terrorist attacks
which
occurred in Paris, stating we shouldn't simply pray for Paris,
but rather, we must recognize we ourselves created this mess, and
only we can solve it - not God.
He put up a post on
his website regarding war and large military establishments, stating
that they are the greatest source of violence in our world and they
exist solely to kill human beings.
Echoing the Mark
Twain quote above, he went on to explain how,
"since armies
are legal, we feel that war is acceptable; in general, nobody
feels that war is criminal or that accepting it is criminal
attitude. In fact, we have been brainwashed."

There is currently
a
shift in consciousness taking place, and instead
of seeing war as
a marvelous weapon and a great piece of technology that kills living
people, we are starting to see that world peace and cooperation are
necessary, and that there is truly no reason for us to be so
divided, or for our governments to fight each other.
The justifications
for war are falling by the wayside, and the cabal continues to
invent problems to withhold this justification.
"No matter how malevolent or evil
are the many murderous dictators who can currently oppress their
nations and cause international problems, it is obvious that
they cannot harm others or destroy countless human lives if they
don't have a military organization accepted and condoned by
society."

Some of these
soldiers that are used by their corporate/big bank puppetmasters are
starting to wake up and speak out.
Here is a
video that provides an example, with some shocking
information that many people are still waking up to (graphic footage
warning).
Shifting
Consciousness
If you find
yourself fearing what is taking place and what is unfolding, explore
it.
-
Why is there fear?
-
What is that fear showing you about yourself?
-
Your beliefs?
-
What you
feel is going on?
-
Do you feel empowered?
-
Do you feel as though you
have no control?
Asking ourselves
these questions helps us to understand ourselves and how we operate.
As an individual we
have the power to assist the collective in massive ways by BEING
from a conscious state. Processing our thoughts, worries, fears and
ultimately how we feel powerless is a huge part of shifting our
consciousness.
Fear can serve us
to show something about ourselves, but it does not serve us to
remain in that state. We cannot create change from that state that
is effective and that will lead to a world where we thrive.
The change we are
looking to create deep down will come from a place of peace.
Remember, these
events and what unfolds are a reflection of mass consciousness and
are providing insight into hat humanity is creating and going
through as a whole.
It also gives us the opportunity to reflect and
create the necessary change from within in order to shift our
experience which helps to shift the world.
The purpose of this
is to help dispel the automatic fear state we go into and instead
get us into a place where we can effectively do something from a
place of peace as opposed to fear.
The Message
From Anonymous
While anonymous'
message here is bringing attention to valuable things, it may not be
the full story and thus far, there is not evidence Trump cut a deal
with
the deep state although there are actions being carried out by
his administration that are of the goal of the deep state.
It's important to
make the distinction so we can better understand the complexity of
what is going on as it shows the influence and fight of the cabal as
they lose control.
On April 6th,
2017, on the 100 year anniversary of America's entry into World
War I, Donald Trump launched airstrikes against the Syrian
government, in retaliation for a gas attack supposedly
perpetrated by Assad.
There was no
investigation, not even a hack job of a frame up like we had in
2003. The evidence we do have contradicts the official story,
and the stakes are much higher this time around.
Then before the
dust had even settled, Trump pivoted to Asia, ratcheting up
intimidation tactics, towards North Korea, threatening
regime change and practically begging the already insecure Kim Jong-un to do something stupid.
And that's the point. Provoke a
response, and then play the victim.
If he cant get
it the old fashion way he might just make one up. Trump cut a
deal with the deep state, and the neoliberal, neocon, and
corporate alliance. They got his back now.
As long as they
get their war, everybody's happy...
