The U.S.' increasingly unhinged rhetoric reached a
new level of absurdity this week as U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary
Clinton called on Western nations and their Arab proxies to "make
it clear that Russia and China will pay a price because they are
holding up progress" in regards to the U.S.' premeditated campaign of
terrorism and violent regime change in Syria:
It was made public as early as 2007 by Seymour Hersh in his report "The
Redirection" published in the New Yorker that,
-
the U.S.
-
Israel
-
Saudi Arabia,
...and others were gathering, funding, arming, and deploying a
front of violent sectarian extremists, many with ties to Al Qaeda, to
undermine, destabilize, and eventually lead to the overthrow of
the governments of Lebanon, Syria, and Iran:
The violent campaign was rolled out publicly in
the wake of a similarly premeditated geopolitical ploy, the so-called "Arab
Spring," and has since then been clearly exposed as the work of violent
terrorist networks. Ironically, these terrorist networks are those allegedly
the impetus of the "War on Terror," now paradoxically being funded, armed,
and politically backed by the West.
It was reported that Libyan terrorists
led by Abdul Hakim Belhaj, commander
of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), a
U.S. State Department-listed
"Foreign Terrorist Organization," had
joined the so-called "Free Syrian
Army" (FSA) along with sectarian extremists from Iraq who
specialize in the
indiscriminate terrorist bombings now ravaging Syria.
In fact, the true nature of Syria's "rebels" has become so well known, that
recent attempts to sway public opinion with continued, but unsubstantiated
reports of "atrocities" aimed at demonizing the Syrian government have been
met with skepticism, doubt, and even indignation by the public - giving
nations like Russia and China not only the opportunity to defy Western
dictates, but a moral imperative to do so as well.
Collapsing Legitimacy
Leads to Collapsing Empires
The global hegemony of Wall Street and London has been built behind a facade
of "human rights," "freedom," and "democracy."
As these principles are eroded back home in the
West, their use for dressing up otherwise naked imperialism, corporate
monopolization, and military aggression abroad has become overt and
increasingly ineffective.
While the U.S. Secretary of State attempts to blame Russia and China for
"holding up progress" in the West's campaign of premeditated destabilization
in Syria, it is more likely that the West's own loss of legitimacy is the
true reason it has not successfully convinced the world to go along with
what is increasingly appearing to be a self-serving and very untenable
agenda.
Should the U.S. fail in its attempts to overthrow the government of Syria, and
quite likely even if it does manage to succeed at this late hour, so much
damage has been done to the West's credibility, as well as to the
credibility of its allegedly independent institutions, that future gambits
will be even more difficult to execute.
As the West's economy and geopolitical power
crumbles and its reach becomes less subtle and more adversarial,
shareholders will seek more secure investments, financially, politically,
and even tactically.
Maintaining an empire relies on an immense global infrastructure the West
still possesses - but it is an infrastructure that is meeting competition
from not only rival hegemonies, but from within individual nations as well,
on both a national and grassroots level.
Empires are also built on psychological factors
such as faith in one's institutions and fear of one's military prowess.
The West has been increasingly faltering in all
respects in a world where these concepts are becoming increasingly
challenged by shifting social, economic, and technological paradigms.
What the West should be doing is positioning itself for this changing world
- instead it is
clinging to a crumbling empire, scrambling to build a global
paradigm rendered antiquated long before it has even been implemented.
Boycotting
the corporate-financier interests
behind this attempt at establishing global hegemony will accelerate and
ensure its failure - while resolving ourselves to creating genuine
institutions on a local and national level for and by the people will ensure
that we are not left in disarray once these corrupt globalist institutions
are rendered moot.
