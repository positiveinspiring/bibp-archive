A French secret serviceman acting on the express
orders of Nicolas Sarkozy is suspected of murdering Colonel
Gaddafi, it was sensationally claimed today.
He is said to have infiltrated a violent mob mutilating the captured Libyan
dictator last year and shot him in the head.
The motive, according to well-placed sources in the North African country,
was to stop Gaddafi being interrogated about his highly suspicious links
with Sarkozy, who was President of France at the time.
There are still pockets of support for former leader Muammar Gaddafi's
regime in Libya, despite his death
Nicolas Sarkozy, France's
former president,
allegedly ordered the murder
of former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi
Other former western leaders, including ex
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, were also extremely close to
Gaddafi, visiting him regularly and helping to facilitate multi-million
pounds business deals.
Sarkozy, who once welcomed Gaddafi as a 'brother leader' during a state
visit to Paris, was said to have received millions from the Libyan despot to
fund his election campaign in 2007.
The conspiracy theory will be of huge concern to Britain which sent RAF jet
to bomb Libya last year with the sole intention of 'saving civilian lives'.
A
United Nations mandate which sanctioned the attack expressly
stated that the western allies could not interfere in the internal politics
of the country.
Instead the almost daily bombing runs ended with Gaddafi's overthrow, while
both French and British military 'advisors' were said to have assisted on
the ground.
Now Mahmoud Jibril, who served as interim Prime Minister following
Gaddafi's overthrow, told Egyptian TV:
'It was a foreign agent who mixed with the
revolutionary brigades to kill Gaddafi.'
Gaddafi was killed on October
20 in a final assault on his hometown Sirte
by fighters of the new
regime, who said they had cornered
the ousted despot in a sewage
pipe waving a golden gun.
The moment was captured on
video

Diplomatic sources in Tripoli, the Libyan
capital, meanwhile suggested to the Italian newspaper Corriere della
Serra that a foreign assassin was likely to have been French.
The paper writes:
'Since the beginning of NATO support for the
revolution, strongly backed by the government of Nicolas Sarkozy,
Gaddafi openly threatened to reveal details of his relationship with the
former president of France, including the millions of dollars paid to
finance his candidacy at the 2007 elections.'
One Tripoli source said:
'Sarkozy had every reason to try to silence
the Colonel and as quickly as possible.'
The view is supported by information gathered by
investigators in Benghazi, Libya's second city and the place where the 'Arab
Spring' revolution against Gaddafi started in early 2011.
Rami El Obeidi, the former head of foreign relations for the Libyan
transitional council, said he knew that Gaddafi had been tracked through his
satellite telecommunications system as he talked to Bashar Al-Assad, the
Syrian dictator.
NATO experts were able to trace the communications' traffic between the two
Arab leaders, and so pinpoint Gaddafi to the city of Sirte, where he was
murdered on October 20 2011.
NATO jets shot up Gaddafi's convoy, before rebels on the ground dragged
Gaddafi from a drain where he was hiding and then subjected him to a violent
attack which was videoed.
In another sinister twist to the story, a 22-year-old who was among the
group which attacked Gaddafi and who frequently brandished the gun said to
have killed him, died in Paris last Monday.
Ben Omran Shaaban was said to have been beaten up himself by Gaddafi
loyalists in July, before being shot twice. He was flown to France for
treatment, but died of his injuries in hospital.
Sarkozy, who lost the presidential election in May, has continually denied
receiving money from Gaddafi.
Today he was unavailable for comment, but is facing a number of enquiries
into alleged financial irregularities.
