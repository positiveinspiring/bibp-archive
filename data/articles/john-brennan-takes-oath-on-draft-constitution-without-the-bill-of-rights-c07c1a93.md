New CIA Director
John Brennan on Friday took his oath of
office behind closed doors, vowing to uphold and serve the U.S.
Constitution. It seems like a very uncontroversial event.
However, Brennan is once again
being criticized, this time for a symbolic gesture he made during his
swearing in ceremony.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest told
reporters on Friday that Brennan was,
sworn in with his hand on an original draft
of the Constitution that had George Washingtons personal handwriting
and annotations on it, dating from 1787.
Brennan reportedly asked for a document from the
National Archives that would adequately,
reaffirm his commitment to the rule of
law as he took his oath of office as director of the CIA.
Pretty cool right?
Well, the only problem,
as blogger Marcy Wheeler notes, the
document that Brennan used at his swearing in is missing a very important
part of the U.S. Constitution that governs the country today - the Bill of
Rights.
The vitally important Bill of Rights, which
includes freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to bear arms,
didnt go into effect until December of 1791 after ratification by the
states.
To be clear, there is certainly no evidence to
suggest that Brennan intentionally chose a document that excluded the Bill
of Rights. But the irony of the document selection given the current
controversy surrounding the federal governments drone program is noteworthy
regardless.
The Bill of Rights includes the right to due
process (Fifth Amendment) and the right to trial by jury (Sixth Amendment),
both key issues in the heated debate over drone strikes.
The White House and Attorney General Eric Holder
both
confirmed earlier this week that the executive branch of the U.S.
government does not have the authority to carry out a drone strike on a
non-combatant American citizen inside the United States.
This admission, of course, came only after Sen.
Rand Paul (R-Ky.)
staged a nearly 13 hour long old-school filibuster to block Brennans
nomination on Wednesday, repeatedly demanding an answer on the issue.
Other outlets
criticized Brennan for not using a Bible at his swearing in. It is
unclear at this point whether past CIA directors have used a Bible or
whether it is customary for them to do so.
Do you think it matters that Brennan took his
oath of office on a draft Constitution that excludes the Bill of Rights?
John Brennan Sworn in as CIA Director...
Using Constitution Lacking Bill of Rights

According to the White House,
John Brennan
was sworn in as
CIA Director on a first draft of the
Constitution including notations from George Washington,
dating to 1787.
Vice President Joe Biden swears in CIA
Director John Brennan in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, March 8,
2013.
Members of Brennans family stand with him.
Brennan was sworn in with his hand on an original draft of the
Constitution, dating from 1787, which has George Washingtons personal
handwriting and annotations on it.
That means, when Brennan vowed to protect and
defend the Constitution, he was swearing on one that did not include the
First, Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendments - or any of the other
Amendments now included in our Constitution.
The
Bill of Rights did not become part of our
Constitution until 1791, 4 years after the Constitution that Brennan took
his oath on.
I really dont mean to be an idiot about this. But these vows always carry a
great deal of symbolism.
And whether he meant to invoke this symbolism or
not, the moment at which Brennan took over the CIA happened to exclude (in
symbolic form, though presumably not legally) the key limits on governmental
power that protect American citizens.
Update
Olivier Knox
describes how the White House pushed the
symbolism of this:
Hours after CIA Director John Brennan took
the oath of office - behind closed doors, far away from the press,
perhaps befitting his status as Americas top spy - the White House took
pains to emphasize the symbolism of the ceremony.
Theres one piece of this that I wanted
to note for you, spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters gathered for
their daily briefing.
Director Brennan was sworn in with his
hand on an original draft of the Constitution that had George
Washingtons personal handwriting and annotations on it, dating from
1787.
Earnest said Brennan had asked for a
document from the National Archives that would demonstrate the U.S. is a
nation of laws.
Director Brennan told the president
that he made the request to the archives because he wanted to
reaffirm his commitment to the rule of law as he took the oath of
office as director of the CIA, Earnest said.
Update
Im assuming this copy of the Constitution is
the one Brennan used:
