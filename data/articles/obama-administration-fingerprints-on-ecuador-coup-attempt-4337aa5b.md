With Nobel "Peace" Prize
laureate Barack Obama,
coups against unaccommodating Latin
American leaders would appear to be back in style.
After Honduran President Zalayas
overthrow in June 2009,
Ecuadors Rafael Correa was the
latest target.
An outspoken member of ALBA and Hugo
Ch√°vez close ally,
Correa had been giving Washington a
tough time.
Behind the abortive coup, Wayne
Madsens investigation
not only unveils the modus operandi
of the CIA,
but also lays bare Mossads murky
activities inside Ecuador.
Ecuadorean President Rafael
Correa speaks from the balcony of the Carondolet Palace
as hundreds of supporters
gathered to greet him in Quito
September 30, 2010.
Using the standard CIA playbook on toppling
democratically-elected governments in Latin America, the Obama
administration, which was not happy with Ecuadorian President Rafael
Correas moves to increase state control over oil companies in the
nation and his decision to oust the United States military from its airbase
at Manta, appears to have suffered a major defeat in the failed coup attempt
in Ecuador by police officers and Air Force personnel who were backed by
rightist elements in the National Assembly and business community.
Correa was re-elected with an overwhelming
majority last year after he gave the U.S. military its walking papers from
the Manta airbase.
The Pentagon and CIA have been working to topple Correa
ever since by pumping money into opposition political parties and other
groups through NGOs funded by the U.S.
National Endowment for Democracy.
In a statement from Correa after his rescue from the Police Hospital in
Quito by a military special operations team, the president warned of a
larger conspiracy launched against him by his political opposition, saying
the,
"attempt at destabilization is the result of
a strategy that has been brewing for quite some time. A barrage of
messages and misinformation have been given to the National Police,
which today has been realized through violent actions from a conspiracy
attempt."
Correas predecessor, the pro-U.S. Lucio
Gutierrez, who is wedded to foreign oil company interests in the
country, was accused by the government of covertly supporting the police and
Air Force mutineers.
Although Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a weak statement saying
the United States backed Correa, it came one day after Clinton heaped praise
on former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the person who helped to craft
the September 11, 1973 coup in Chile and the assassination of its
progressive president Salvador Allende.
In fact, Clinton and Obama had given military
and political support to the right-wing junta that ousted
democratically-elected progressive President Manuel Zelaya in Honduras in
June 2009 and has fought against allowing the ousted democratically-elected
president of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to return to his country from
exile in South Africa after the CIA-engineered coup against him in 2004.
Clintons tepid response to the attempted coup against Correa was in marked
contrast to the strong denunciations of the attempted coup and messages of
support for Correa that came from,
-
Venezuela
-
Brazil
-
Argentina
-
Peru
-
Mexico
-
Bolivia
-
Cuba
-
Spain
Riot police repel supporters
of Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa
from reaching the hospital
where he took refuge for protection from police protesters, in Quito
September 30, 2010.
And the fact that Correa, like Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez, who was briefly ousted in an April 2002 coup
organized by the CIA, was held as a virtual hostage at the Police Hospital
in Quito for the greater part of a day provided a grim reminder of an old
CIA tactic in staging coups in Latin America.
Chavez was briefly held hostage on a Venezuelan
island in the Caribbean while a U.S.-registered plane stood by to fly him
into exile. In an emergency Latin American summit meeting in Argentina,
Chavez saw the U.S. behind the events in Ecuador.
He said,
"The Yankee extreme right is trying right
now, through arms and violence, to retake control of the continent."
Chavezs own experience with a CIA backed coup
and the June 2009 coup, supported by the Pentagon, CIA, and Mossad against
his ally Zelaya in Honduras, makes him an expert on CIA and Mossad tactics
in the region.
Informed sources have told WMR [1] that Correa and
Chavez are currently comparing notes on the coups launched against them.

Ecuadorian intelligence will be looking closely at the wereabouts of key CIA
personnel stationed at the CIA station at the US embassy in Quito and a
smaller CIA station within the US Agency for International Development (USAID)
mission in Guayaquil.
In the 2002 coup attempt against Chavez, the US
embassys top CIA and DIA officers were discovered to be helping to direct
the coup from Venezuelan military installations.
Clintons State Department has been casting Ecuador in a bad light
throughout the past two years, calling the country "difficult to do business
in," the only real priority that the Obama administration cares about due to
its total subservience to Wall Street and the fat cat bankers.
The State Departments "Investment Climate
Statement" for Ecuador states:
"Ecuador can be a difficult place in which
to do business... There are restrictions or limitations on private
investment in many sectors that apply equally to domestic and foreign
investors... A 2006 hydrocarbons law imposed new conditions in the
petroleum sector that have been problematic for many companies,
complicated by a 2007 decree that imposed additional restrictions.
A 2008 mining mandate stalled mining
activity, and a new Mining Law is expected in early 2009. Negotiations
for a free trade agreement between the United States and Ecuador, which
would have included investment provisions, stopped in April 2006. The
current Government of Ecuador has not expressed interest in restarting
negotiations."
Correas financial policies, as well as his
foreign policy that saw him order out the American base at Manta and
establish close ties with Venezuela, Iran, and other countries inimical to
American and Israeli hegemony, placed a huge CIA and Mossad target on
Correas back.
In June, Ecuador sponsored a resolution at the
Organization of American State (OAS) summit in Lima condemning Israels
attack on the Turkish aid flotilla transporting humanitarian aid to Gaza.
Ten nations voted with Ecuador in support of the resolution.

military airbase of the
Mariscal Sucre International Airport to force its closure, in Quito
September 30, 2010.
The uprising among Ecuadorian Air Force ranks, with Air Force personnel
taking over and shutting down Quitos international airport, will have
Ecuadorian counter-intelligence personnel looking closely at the possible
role of Israeli technicians and trainers who support the Air Forces 26
Israeli-made Kfir combat planes.
Israel also reportedly sold Python-3
air-to-air missiles to the Ecuadorian Air Force in 1997.
Mossad also has its hooks into the Ecuadorian National Police, where the
main coup plotters received support.
Mossad is chiefly tasked with spying on
Ecuadors large Ecuadorian-Arab community.
The activities of the Mossad
station at the Israeli embassy in Quito before and during the coup attempt
will also draw the attention of counter-intelligence officers.
Last year, Tel Aviv-based
On Track Innovations
received a contract to provide an electronic biometric-based electronic
identification card system to Ecuadors Central Registry Office.
