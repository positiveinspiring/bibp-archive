They, the Powers That Used To Be, are trying it
again.
You know, the whole 'problem, response, solution' thing that they use to
control large numbers of mostly hypnotized people on this planet. They
create a 'problem' that causes you to go into fear mode which is chemically
triggered by the R-complex in your lower brain matrix, and then they control
you through your emotions by manipulating events such that you agree to give
them your power in exchange for them providing a 'solution' to the 'problem'
that they caused.
They had thought that their 'Israel versus Iran' problem would be sufficient
to lever the planetary populace into a middle east focused global war. It
did not work since so many of us were watching for so long.
Note, and you may certainly argue with me, that the planetary populace focus
on the potential for a [nu-war] beginning with the [Israeli mistake] has
contributed to the destruction of potential emotional energy for that war to
exist.
Also note I am not saying anything more than words from
HPH 'participated' in the process of grounding that potential war. It works on
an energetic level beyond the condensate matter plane which is the 'place'
where your body, the planet, universe and all the pies exist. It works at
this energetic level by concentrating 'attention' which is a form of
'directly focused consciousness. (Note... little 'c' consciousness, not BIG
'C").
This directly focused consciousness acts as a spot light may act on a
particularly vulnerable area of a house, which is to say, preventing
burglary and other mischief due to the 'exposure' to the whole neighborhood.
So they fell back to Plan 'B'... also please note that TPTW (The Powers
That Were) undoubtedly have Plan B as a bolded statement in their minds.
This is due to their whole attitude of "we are the grown-ups in this world"
and we have 'really really serious plans'. Yeah... right (sarcastic derision
here).
The Plan B, it appears, is to generate a war between amongst the Korean
peoples. Nope, not as good as getting the whole planetary populace whipped
up about the
Israeli's and Jews versus the
Farsi and Islamists, but hey?
what can you do... it's a plan B.
Ok, so mostly Korea is too far away from
the energy (oil) center of the planet, (note that location matters to TPTW
in their majic plots, so to have to move their war is quite irritating
indeed), and outside the usual emotional framework of the hundreds of
millions of sheeple that TPTW (the powers that were) are trying to herd, but
what the hell. In cases of desperation, you take what you can get.
So they are trying to promote this latest [nu-war] effort into their
[coup-de-grace] that would, in their
twisted reptilian minds, lead to WW3,
then
the NWO, and their wet dream of the great harvest of souls.
They are desperately working their Plan B, this is, by the way, their
response to the
Chinese submarine continental ballistic missile signal off
the coast of California. All this shit is connected... in case you were not
paying attention.
The Plan B, again as an aside, is no where near their
ideal energy draining control-of-planetary-humans optimum, and they, that is
the former powers-that-be, are in a desperate, and intensely fearful state,
as they realize just how shaky their position has become. They know they are
in deep and sinking fast.
So look for them to be both stupid, and careless.
Since the former-powers-that-be are trapped in ritualistic, even reptilian,
thinking, they will re-run one of their previous hits, which is to say,
expect another 'Gulf of
Tonkin' incident. Only this time in the seas off of
Korea, and considerably more violent.
In fact, judging from our emotional
quantifiers and the steady erosion of emotional tone sums within the FPTB
(Former
ThePowersThatBe) entity in our model-space, they will likely have to
pretty much totally destroy at least 1/one large, American carrier group in
the Gulf Of Tonkin Incident, Part Deaux.
Now please note...if you are ignorant of what the Gulf of Tonkin Incident
is, and how it affected your life and the social fabric of the planet,
you
should go look it up now. We will wait till you get back...
Ok, she's back.
And now we have our cultural perspective, yes? The twisted humans that we
all call minions, also known as scummy politicians, are being instructed by
their masters, which include but are not limited to,
the banksters, to
'play' us all with a new war, and to do it NOW.
They will arrange for an 'in your face' provocation to the North Koreans,
that will NOT be visible to anyone other than the North Koreans. This will
be their 'problem statement', that they anticipate will drive the North
Koreans quite batshit, and they in turn will respond violently (as they have
been trained by decades of trauma induced and planned by the old TPTB).
The
violent response is likely to be an unexpectedly sophisticated low flying
missile attack on multiple ships in a carrier group. The attack, as TPTW
hope, would be devastatingly successful since the American fleet commanders
are 'not' aware that they are the sacrificial goats this time.
The use of
the word 'goats' is quite specific as many of the upper echelon naval
surface ship officers are
masons (a secret society abhorrent to regular
humans), and thus really should know better. But, probably they were out the
day of the meeting and so were chosen to be the goat by everyone else. Yes,
masons, I do know of what I speak and the mental image in your mind now is
quite deliberate.
The resultant horrific destruction of ships and men, it is thought by the
former-powers-that-be, would be enough to compensate, energetically, in
sparking their global war.
Will it?
Well... time and all the planetary humans will determine the outcome of
their Plan B approach.
You see, it is a question of energies, not only nuclear and armies of men
and machines, but also of the energy of focused attention by humans. This is
the woo-woo part in case you had not noticed. The focused concentration of
all the planetary humans is now being directed to the stage play organized
by a bunch of twisted/damaged minds around the traumatized Korean peoples.
For them, that is, the twisted fuckers who planned this, the situation
'appears' to be a prime Plan B.
But, as any human knows, plans usually don't work out in manifesting
universe, at least not as conceived inside the limitations of mind. To think
otherwise is delusion... do not kid yourself.
So... what I am doing is to consider the problem of the Korean peoples not
from the view being crafted by TPTW and their loyal but stupid press
minions, but rather to focus my attention on the whole production (getting
my mind away from their narrow perception), and to consider the Korean
peoples not as warring parties, but as a family of related humans, deeply
traumatized by the insidious and hideous actions of a small group of power
elite that behave as though they are not human.
Now then, what is to be done about Plan B?
Well... do not expect me to
answer that question for you. There are thoughts I have, mainly of trying to
heal the trauma state of the Koreans, and yes, some of the healing involves
pie (if you don't get it by now, and can't smell the cinnamon wafting up in
the warm scent of baked apples carried by the gently roasting wheat, then
you seriously need to learn to bake).
And yes, they, the thoughts are a good
start, but obviously not enough. We live in the plane of matter condensed
from the energy of universe.
Some of the thoughts must express themselves on
the material plane... thus this missive. Not a missile. Rather a string of
words designed to excite other words in other minds until maybe, just maybe,
within the storm of words, will arise the necessary vibrational harmonic
that will begin the resonance that will derail Plan B.
We could tell the American navy guys, through their buddies in secret
society criminal activities, the masons, that we know. But you can't warn
them... that would probably be some kind of criminal act under the many
constraining 'laws' from the minions and TPTW (the powers that were).
But,
we could express our sadness - to them, their families will find out soon
enough so don't go adding to their up coming trauma and please stand by to
aid and comfort all of the families of those who will be sacrificed for the
political and banker welfare in this next new war.
This needs to be treated
with respect as these men and women will all soon be dead and deserve no
less than our serious intent to preserve their lives, even if they think the wu-jo to be woo-woo, and their 'mission' to be righteous. If you take their
death and their mission seriously, and acknowledge their courage, even in
the presence of the larger ignorance about their fate, then they may be
reachable. Not that it would, or even could change much.
Been there
(military brat), so I understand the situation that traps these brave
humans.
We could figure out a way to tell the Koreans that they are being 'played by
the elites', but will they listen? Would they recognize the power that they
have to step outside the paradigm being rapidly built to fence them in to a
cage match?
Would they, even if they understand the broader strategy
employed against them, have the raw human courage to stand up and say,
"I am
human. I am courage personified. I fiercely fight for my family, my tribe,
my country, my planet. I do not fight for profit and amusement for twisted
minds. Your fucking war does not start with me."
The Koreans that I know are
such people as to say this. They are the Koreans of the Tae Kwon Do... which
is also an art of peace.
But I am open to suggestion. These are just my thoughts, what are yours?
If we don't do something, the obvious will continue.
This Plan B does not
suit me, how about you?
