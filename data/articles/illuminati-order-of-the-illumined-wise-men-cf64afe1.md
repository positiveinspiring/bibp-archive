May 1, 1776, was the most important date in Freemasonry's Luciferic New World Order Plans.
On that date an obscure Jesuit-trained professor of canon law at the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria, Adam Weishaupt, founded a secret society called the Ancient and Illuminated Seers of Bavaria (AISB for short).
Illuminati was founded on a mixture of:
Masonic secrets (Luciferic Doctrine) Islamic Mysticism (Sufism) Jesuit mental discipline (Hatha Yoga)
Masonic secrets (Luciferic Doctrine)
Islamic Mysticism (Sufism)
Jesuit mental discipline (Hatha Yoga)
A unique and dangerous element was it's scientific use of the drug, hashish, to produce an "illuminated" state of mind-derived directly through the Knights Templar's association with the Order of the Assassins (circa 1050 AD).
Illumination had long been a cherished component of Masonry and other occult groups. The Masonic candidate requests, and is promised "light in Masonry." As he goes up the ladder of initiation, he receives "more light". It is because of this society's emphasis on illumination that the AISB became known by its more common title, the Illuminati. The term Illuminati, is the plural of the Latin, Illuminatus, meaning "one who is illuminated." Thus, it means a person who has received the full extent of the initiation that is available through Freemasonry. Technically, an Illuminatus is a Master Mason who has received all the "light" Masonry can bestow. He is beyond 32째 and even beyond 33째!
Such people are known as the Masters of Masters of the Temple, and collectively are known by several names other than the Illuminati.

Most of The Elite were born elite.
Their upbringing is steeped in tradition and is a kind of secret society in of itself. Their father was a Mason, his father was a Mason, his father's father was a Mason.
Perhaps while growing up the child heard stories of his father's involvement in other secret groups.
'There exists in the world today, and has existed for thousands of years, a body of enlightened humans united in what might be termed, an Order of the Quest. It is composed of those whose intellectual and spiritual perceptions have revealed to them that civilization has secret destiny...The outcome of this 'secret destiny' is a World Order ruled by a King with supernatural powers. This King was descended of a divine race; that is, he belonged to the Order of the Illumined for those who come to a state of wisdom then belong to a family of heroes-perfected human beings.' from 'The Secret Destiny of America' by Manly P.
