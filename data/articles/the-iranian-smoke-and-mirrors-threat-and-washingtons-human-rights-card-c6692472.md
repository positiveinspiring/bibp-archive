In a cycle of habit borne
out repeatedly in the mainstream western media,
demonization and fear mongering against Iran is picking
up pace again in the face of attempts by the new Iranian
President Hassan Rouhani to rebuild relations with the
west and work toward international cooperation.
The techniques and
methodologies used by the west in perpetuating the
geopolitically-motivated, neo-imperialist, agenda
against Iran often come across in the media as clumsy
and awkward in their reasoning.
Before delving into the hard
geopolitical reality, a much needed word on the
disingenuous leveraging of human-rights against
countries such as Iran is critical.
Iran and the Western
"Human Rights Card"
In a recent
Fox News report, Irans
human rights record is criticized by Benjamin Weinthal, a Berlin-based
fellow of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD).
His arguments are employed to
argue against the feasibility of pragmatic negotiations with Iran as
according to his logic, Iran is not a regime "worthy" of practical
negotiation with.
To use the reported human right
violations against religious minorities and Christians and particular as
geopolitical leverage to argue against diplomacy and negotiation with Iran
wreaks of compromised, corporate-financier motivation, especially when
juxtaposed with
the intimate collaboration of the United States
and its allies with one of the most repressive regimes in the Middle East
(and the world), Saudi Arabia.
While Iran is often berated for
its short-comings, these short-comings pale in comparison to the atrocities
perpetuated by the Saudis. In Saudi Arabia, no Jewish or Christian worship
is allowed and possession of a Bible could warrant you various brutal
punishments.
Saudi Arabia has been notorious
for
rigid campaigns against Bible possession and religious symbols,
especially in airport customs searches including the shredding of any Bibles
found and in one case,
harassing a nun
who was passing through Jeddah on a transit flight.
Saudi Arabia, in cooperation with the United States, is
currently promoting a
sectarian-extremist-driven destabilization campaign in Syria whose
byproduct has resulted in nightmarish lives for people across religious
lines which can be described as nothing less than
premeditated genocide with former CIA official Robert Baer
predicting campaigns against Christians in Syria and Lebanon during an
interview with Seymour Hersh for his excellent 2007 article, "The
Redirection."
What is rather ironic in light of western focus on Iran is
that Baer stated that joint US-Saudi-Israeli machinations in Lebanon, which
were generating radical Islamist groups, would necessitate the protection of
Christians which would be done by Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah of
Hezbollah and the Shiites as opposed to the US and France.
Iran is predominantly Shiite and while conservative Islam is
the norm, this conservatism is distinct from the twisted
inventions and atrocities
of radical Wahabism in Saudi Arabia which serve as the hotbed of global Al
Qaeda activity.
Let it not be forgotten that Saudi Arabia is the
primary underwriter of Al
Qaedas proliferation throughout Eurasia, done admittedly and particularly
in line with western imperialist designs of isolating Iran and serving as
geopolitical pawns.
It
is noted that the Taliban and the Wahabi fundamentalists that constitute its
ranks and the ranks of extremists from Nigeria to the Philippines would not
exist without Saudi financing done purposefully to create a twisted brand of
Islam and produce a "Swiss-Army knife" to be used against the targets of
western foreign policy such as
Syria today and previously against
Afghanistan during the 1980s; it has since formed the cornerstone of the
fake "war on terror"
driven by
western neo-imperialist interests.
The
largest arms sale in U.S. history has been to Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia regularly conducts brutal
executions through the means of hooded swordsmen including on religious
charges of being accused of "sorcery
and witchcraft" in the grimly-dubbed "Chop-Chop
Square."
Women are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia
and foreign women cannot visit the country without being accompanied by a
male guardian. In addition to toeing the line of western
corporate-financier geopolitical agendas
in cooperation with Israel such as in Syria, the Saudi establishment
interlocks with these interests as noted in points "6" and "7" in the
article "Introducing
the Gulf State Despots" by Tony Cartalucci.
Iran, which may have its shortcoming, has an
unprecedented standard when compared to Saudi Arabia. Iranian Jews,
Christians, and Zoroastrians are guaranteed their own seats on the Iranian
parliament in proportion to their population.
Iranian Jews, roughly 30,000 in population,
enjoy relatively peaceful lives in Iran with a Jewish hospital, two kosher
restaurants in Tehran, 11 synagogues, many with Hebrew schools, and a Jewish
library including 20,000 titles.
Irans Ayatollah Khomeini issued edits in the
1980s stating that Irans Jewish and Christian populations be "protected."
Many of these points are noted by Benjamin Schetts article "Debunking
Anti-Iran Propaganda" which conflict with the gravely austere picture
painted by western media.
This short
documentary by Journeyman Pictures gives a candid picture of Jewish life
in Iran:
It is often claimed that Iran promotes
institutionalized anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial but
Benjamin Schett explains why this is not true.
Ahmadinejad has made accusations against the
reliability of the Holocaust but this does NOT represent the position of the
Iranian state or people whose state-media even broadcasted a popular,
Hollywood-quality film commemorating the suffering of the Jews and
featuring the story of Abdol Hossein Sardari, an Iranian diplomat who helped
save Jews from the Holocaust by giving them false passports to flee
Nazi-occupied France.
Irans former Jewish Member of Parliament, Moris
Motamed, has
criticized Ahmadinejad for his statements on the Holocaust and even held
a press conference to denounce those statements. However, such sentiments
must not be seen as reflecting the entirety of the Iranian society as
clearly is not the case.
Criticism against Israel is mainstream and
expected but not because of any religious animosity towards the Jews, as
Ahmadinejad himself stated in a speech in Esfahan cited by Schett, but
rather because of the complicated political issues surrounding the
Palestinian plight.
Benjamin Schett notes that it is impossible to give
100% insight of life as a religious minority in a religiously conservative
country without being in that position oneself but unlike in Saudi Arabia,
at least such minorities openly exist.
Of course, such minorities must not settle for the bare
minimum and as a westerner, Im in the tradition of the equality for all.
If and where any cases of rights violations exist, such as
those noted in the original Fox News article by Benjamin Weinthal,
they must be openly addressed but done so in a manner unlike the western
medias purpose which is to highlight certain facts, at the expense of
others, and use any incident they can as propaganda fodder for the sake of
western geopolitical objectives aimed at stifling peace and diplomacy,
substituting it with war-mongering, and covering up the west and its assets
own serial crimes against humanity.
Foundation for the
Defense of Democracies (FDD) - Is it Really About Democracy?
Of particular interest in the Fox News article is that the
author, Benjamin Weinthal, is listed as a fellow at the Foundation for the
Defense of Democracies (FDD), an organization with a vested interest in
promoting western corporate- financier objectives around the world with
human rights simply employed as an easily-leveraged cloak for naked
imperialism.
I will assume good faith on the part of Benjamin Wienthal as
many people drawn into organizations and NGOs that served western subversion
are drawn it by honest intentions which is something that imperialist
systems exploit as
they have in history.
Nevertheless, the overall bulk and existence of
the FDD cannot be casually excused when one gets an insight into the
interests and networks propping it up. Tony Cartalucci in his excellent
article, "The
War on Terror is a Fraud", explains the FDD:
The
Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) is
a corporate and
US State Department-funded policy institute that
claims to be dedicated to promoting,
"pluralism, defending democratic values, and fighting the
ideologies that threaten democracy."
It is decidedly "Neo-Conservative" and focuses almost
exclusively on starting and maintaining wars at Americas expense.
FDDs "executive
team" includes James Woolsey and Clifford May, while its "leadership
council" includes Bill Kristol - all signatories of a recent Foreign
Policy Initiative
letter addressed to House Republicans asking them to discard the UN
mandate for NATOs Libyan intervention and commit more support specifically
for regime change.
Acting
Senator Joseph Lieberman also can be found
on FDDs "leadership council"
and has been a chief proponent of war with Libya, as well as Syria and Iran,
alongside John McCain.
FDD
has a myriad of publications expressing the elation of the
"Neo-Conservative" establishment over current operations against Libya and
the possible springboard the Libyan war serves toward US intervention in
Syria and Iran. FDDs only criticism of Obama is that more should be done,
faster, and at a greater expense to America.
Michael Ledeen, a "freedom scholar," expresses this well in his article
titled, "Lessons
of Libya (and Syria, and, Some Day, Iran)," where he throws in his
organizations collective desire to intervene in both Syria and Iran, for
good measure.
The Atlantic article, "Al-Qaeda
Is Winning," written by FDD "senior fellow" Daveed Gartenstein-Ross,
expresses the true contempt these individuals have toward their audience.
In this piece reflecting on the last 10 years of
the "War on Terror," Gartenstein-Ross claims that Al Qaedas ability to use
cheap means to provoke the United States into a multi-billion dollar defense
is rendering an Al Qaeda victory through a "strategy of a thousand cuts."
Of course, the x-ray machines and other security
apparatuses being installed across the United States and the tremendous
amount of money being used to sustain combat operations around the world
"hunting terrorists," doesnt go into a black hole. Instead, it goes into
the pockets of the very people funding the work of Mr. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross
and his peers throughout his and other US and British think-tanks.
Those who have read
my recent article on Libya will note the entirely illegitimate nature of
the NATO campaign against Libya and the intellectually bankrupt mentality of
those who shamefully perpetuate its talking-points.
The FDD, at the top of the organization, is not
merely concerned with human rights themselves but rather leveraging such
concerns for their own sake, something the US government and the
corporate-financier interests it represents have clearly done before
with regards to China.
It should be noted that the FDD is just one
element in the neo-imperialist racket.
Other corporate-financier, "globalist"
think-tanks, who are the true underwriters of western policy, includes,
In "Naming
Names - Your Real Government", Tony Cartalucci points out who truly
controls the United States/NATO and lists the prominent individuals and
corporations financing and directing them.
Iran and the Western
Geopolitical Struggle
The Brookings Institution is of particular
concern among these think-tanks as it has been the primary facilitator in
the drive for war against Iran founded on distortion and
geopolitically-motivated propaganda.
Contrary to media reports portraying Iran as an
immediate, existential threat to US and Israeli security, the
Brookings Institute
released a policy report that was basically a
handbook for overthrowing nations titled
Which Path to Persia?.
It was written by six prominent analysts within
establishment circles, including
Kenneth Pollack, admitting that Iran poses not a threat to the survival
of the United States and Israels security but their collective regional and
geopolitical hegemony and interests across the region.
It was noted that Iran was playing a strategy of
firmness and even aggressiveness but not recklessness in combating western
hegemony and imperialism as can be seen in its recent economic endeavors in
the
pipeline and gas politics of the region:
It was also noted that Iran was deliberately
avoiding a conflagration with the west and that any possible nuclear weapons
capability for Iran (which is noted as unconfirmed and nonexistent in other
reports) would be used as a deterrence for attack and protecting regional
ambitions Iran has for the region (pg. 24-25).
This is reconfirmed by the recent 2013
RAND Corporation report Iran After the Bomb
which while noting that no evidence exists that Iran is pursuing nuclear
weapons according to the US intelligence community, envisions a post-nuclear
scenario of Iran.
RAND
is another "globalist" think-tank that hosts compromised interests but
manages to give an honest synopsis of the Iranian reality. It is also noted
that Irans "supreme leader" Ayatollah Khamenei has issued religious decrees
labeling nuclear weapons as "against Islamic principles."
Contrary to recent reports circulation by MEMRI TV and mainstream media,
these fatwas are not fake and
actually do exist.
And contrary to some critics, they are not an example of taqiyya (deception)
as Juan Cole
notes.
One thing that is very revealing is the
following statement by RAND which sums up their insightful report:
The Islamic Republic [of Iran] is a revisionist state
that seeks to undermine what it perceives to be the American-dominated
order in the Middle East. However, it does not have territorial
ambitions and does not seek to invade, conquer, or occupy other nations.
Its chief military aim is to deter a U.S. and/or Israeli
military attack while it undermines American allies in the Middle East
[which includes the economic interests of the totalitarian kingdoms of
Saudi Arabia and Qatar whose atrocities in human rights dwarfs anything
Iran is guilty of]
Irans
possession of nuclear weapons will lead to greater tension between the
Shia theocracy and the conservative Sunni monarchies [Saudi Arabia,
Qatar, etc.]
However, Iran is unlikely to use nuclear weapons against
other Muslim countries
The Islamic Republic views Israel in ideological terms.
However, it is very unlikely that Iran would use nuclear weapons against
Israel, given the latters overwhelming conventional and nuclear
military superiority.
(pg. vii)
The Brookings Institution not only enumerates transparently
the similar points that Iran is not an existential threat but goes further
to enumerate a list of strategies for US provocations against Iran to
initiate a war that, according to the report, Iran does not want.
It is even noted that an Iranian retaliation in the case of
American airstrikes would not be inevitable and that Iran may deliberately
refrain from retaliation in order to strategically "play the victim" (pg.
84-85, 95)
Let it not be forgotten how the US and Britain staged the
CIA "Operation Ajax"
in 1953 to oust the democratically-elected Iranian president Mohammad
Mosaddegh, who nationalized the countrys oil, in favor of the pro-American
Shah who ruled as a brutal dictator.
Similar plans for regime change are enumerated in the
Brookings Institute report where it is admitted that the opposition "Green
Movement" in 2009 was orchestrated by the US government through "civil
society and NGOs" in order to provoke Iranian belligerence through regime
change operations, capitalizing on internal dissent.
This is not to deny any legitimate aspirations and calls for
reform in Iran which are prevalent among student groups but merely to point
out how such ambitions are co-opted and used by western interests for their
own agenda (103-105, 109-110).
See this excellent
summary of all these critical points.
Other means proposed included playing upon sectarian and ethnic divisions
inside Iran to destabilize the country and even funding radical Sunni
militant groups, specifically the MEK, which has killed Americans in the
past and is labeled by the U.S. state department as a "foreign terrorist
organization". Its ideology is described by analysts as radical "left-wing"
Islamic-Marxism which makes it interesting to consider the US plans to fully
employ this group as political assets.
MEK
has also collaborated with Saddam Husseins forces in guerilla warfare
against Iran in the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s (113, 117-118).
The
group is against the dominant Iranian establishment and it is noted that the
US has worked covertly with them in the past and that in order to work
overtly with them, the group had to be removed from the terrorist list
(118).
Regarding the MEK on pages 117-118, Brookings states:
"Perhaps the most prominent (and certainly the
most controversial) opposition group that has attracted attention as a
potential U.S. proxy is the NCRI (National Council of Resistance of Iran),
the political movement established by the MEK (Mujahedin-e Khalq).
Critics believe the group to be undemocratic and
unpopular, and indeed anti-American.
In contrast, the groups champions contend that
the movements long-standing opposition to the Iranian regime and record of
successful attacks on and intelligence-gathering operations against the
regime make it worthy of U.S. support.
They also argue that the group is no longer
anti-American and question the merit of earlier accusations.
Raymond Tanter, one of the groups supporters in
the United States, contends that the MEK and the NCRI are allies for regime
change in Tehran and also act as a useful proxy for gathering intelligence.
The MEKs greatest intelligence coup was the provision of intelligence in
2002 that led to the discovery of a secret site in Iran for enriching
uranium.
Despite its defenders claims, the MEK remains
on the U.S. government list of foreign terrorist organizations. In the
1970s, the group killed three U.S. officers and three civilian contractors
in Iran. During the 1979-1980 hostage crisis, the group praised the decision
to take America hostages and Elaine Sciolino reported that while group
leaders publicly condemned the 9/11 attacks, within the group celebrations
were widespread.
Undeniably, the group has conducted terrorist
attacks - often excused by the MEKs advocates because they are directed
against the Iranian government.
For example, in 1981, the group bombed the
headquarters of the Islamic Republic Party, which was then the clerical
leaderships main political organization, killing an estimated 70 senior
officials. More recently, the group has claimed credit for over a dozen
mortar attacks, assassinations, and other assaults on Iranian civilian and
military targets between 1998 and 2001.
At the very least, to work more closely with the
group (at least in an overt manner), Washington would need to remove it from
the list of foreign terrorist organizations."
The compounded criminality of western and
Israeli collaboration with MEK is emphasized
here.
It should be noted that the MEK has recently
been removed from the US list of terrorist organizations as part of the next
phase of using them as a proxy. MEK claims to have killed 40,000 Iranians in
the past and has been trained on U.S. soil in a secret base in Nevada,
published on the Huffington Post and
cited here by Kurt Nimmo in an excellent and well-sourced article
emphasizing the coordinated western agenda against Iran.
In culminating these abhorrent proposals,
Brookings further notes the option of a military invasion and conventional
war against Iran if the above proposals failed to accomplish western
interests.
This is the most alarming option especially in
context to the following admission:
If the United States were to decide that to
garner greater international support, galvanize U.S. domestic support,
and/or provide a legal justification for an invasion, it would be best
to wait for an Iranian provocation, then the time frame for an invasion
might stretch out indefinitely...
However, since it would be up to Iran to
make the provocative move, which Iran has been wary of doing most times
in the past, the United States would never know for sure when it would
get the requisite Iranian provocation. In fact, it might never come at
all (65)
it would be far more preferable if the United States could
cite an Iranian provocation as justification for the airstrikes [as a
catalyst for an invasion] before launching them.
Clearly, the more outrageous, the more
deadly, and the more unprovoked the Iranian action, the better off the
United States would be.
Of course, it would be very difficult for
the United States to goad Iran into such a provocation without the rest
of the world recognizing this game, which would then undermine it (85).
In all this certified criminality, which has
obviously been at play even as the report was being published in 2009, it
must not be forgotten that the
Brookings Institution is of, for, and by big business and their
collective agenda of integrating Iran into their international consensus and
exploiting its 76 million population for their unipolar order.
This is opposed to Irans attempts to foster
national self-sufficiency and develop ties with nations strategic to western
interests including
India, Thailand, China, and Russia.
Brookings Institution is funded by the likes of,
...among others.
Their report even includes a special
acknowledgement of financial support from the Smith Richardson Foundation
upon which
Zbigniew Brzezinski sits as an active
governor as pointed out by Tony Cartalucci and easily verifiable in the
reports preface.
Such international criminality is magnified when
Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist
Seymour Hersh revealed in his article "Preparing the Battlefield" that
the U.S. is cooperating with their anti-Iranian terrorist asset, Saudi
Arabia, in order to fund radical, Al Qaeda-linked, Sunni-groups
like the Jundallah to destabilize and
destroy Iran as a viable geopolitical opponent.
Al Qaeda, directed by the Saudis in cooperation
with western geopolitical objectives, has been leveraged as a "Swiss army
knife of destabilization" across the Middle East in the fake "war on terror"
as Seymour Hersh exposed in another report titled "The
Redirection" published in 2007.
In that report, Hersh reveals that the U.S. and
Saudi Arabia have been working since 2007 to destabilize Syria and Lebanon
with a wave of sectarian-extremists currently being marketed in the media as
a "political uprising" and a "revolution".
This is different from the legitimate internal
political opposition in Syria that has collaborated with the Syrian
government in a reform initiative and maintains distinctiveness from the
extremist and terrorist elements that clearly constitute the bulk of the
"Syrian rebels" supported by the west.
In his report, Seymour Hersh states:
To undermine Iran, which is predominantly
Shiite, the Bush Administration has decided, in effect, to reconfigure its
priorities in the Middle East. In Lebanon, the Administration has cooperated
with Saudi Arabias government, which is Sunni, in clandestine operations
that are intended to weaken Hezbollah, the Shiite organization that is
backed by Iran.
The U.S. has also taken part in clandestine
operations aimed at Iran and its ally Syria.
A by-product of these activities has been the
bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision of Islam
and are hostile to America and sympathetic to Al Qaeda
[Saudi Arabia's
Prince] Bandar and other Saudis have assured the White House that "they will
keep a very close eye on the religious fundamentalists."
Their message to us was Weve created this
movement, and we can control it. Its not that we dont want the Salafis
[Al Qaeda] to throw bombs; its who they throw them at - Hezbollah, Moqtada
al-Sadr, Iran, and at the Syrians, if they continue to work with Hezbollah
and Iran.
There is no doubt that there is an
anti-Iranian proxy conflict being waged in Syria by a
joint US-Saudi-Israeli effort to further the
Wall Street-London geopolitical consensus.
Undermining and destabilizing Syria would
further isolate Iran and perpetuate
the united geopolitical front against Iran that has been the objective
of western politicians and think-tanks. Iran would ultimately serve as a
vital door into central Asia and a springboard against
Russia and China who are the
ultimate target for absorption within the western design of a unipolar world
order.
Former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, who is an active agent
in the networks of these machinations, makes it no secret in his book
The Grand Chessboard
that U.S. "global pre-eminence" (a euphemism for
Wall Street/London
geopolitical domination and a unipolar world order) is the agenda along with
American influence in central Asia to which Iran is a doorway.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has also spoken of hegemonic
ambitions on the part of the west to establish a unipolar order at a
2007 Munich conference:
Vladimir Putin... Exposes the NWO
In addition to this evidence of open
subversion, it must be noted that
Clinton Bastin,
former director of US nuclear weapons production programs,
has sent an open letter to President Obama in December 2011 claiming
that there is no nuclear weapons threat from Iran, stating the following on
Irans nuclear weapons program:
The
ultimate product of Irans gas centrifuge facilities would be highly
enriched uranium hexafluoride, a gas that cannot be used to make a
weapon.
Converting the gas to metal, fabricating components and
assembling them with high explosives using dangerous and difficult
technology that has never been used in Iran would take many years after
a diversion of three tons of low enriched uranium gas from fully
safeguarded inventories.
The resulting weapon, if intended for delivery by
missile, would have a yield equivalent to that of a kiloton of
conventional high explosives.
As
warmongering against Iran is expected to drastically pick up pace as western
designs for domination across the Middle East show increasing signs of
faltering, it is absolutely critical to be educated on these matters in
order to undermine and extinguish the effects of
the media propaganda
echo-chamber.
This
is not to deny any human rights accusations against Iran altogether but one
must guard themselves from being misguided and swayed by disingenuous
corporate-financier, globalist interests seeking to expand their empire.
It
is imperative for people around the world to recognize the corporations and
institutions perpetuating systematic atrocities and genocide across the
planet and realize that once they eliminate the sovereignty of other
countries, they will then turn their attention fully to the people within
their own borders in the west.
A
real revolution will come by boycotting the degenerate corporations and
financier interests seeking to enslave humanity and building up our own
communities to create a world order
in our own image and not in the image of Wall Street and London.
