Think about it.
-
Where is this seemingly staged Wikileaks
furor taking us?
-
While we participate in digging into the
juicy tidbits of information that incriminate just about anybody and
everybody, where is it all going?
One of their central themes and modus operandums is Ordo Ab Chao- order
out of chaos.
Lessons of 9/11
While 9/11 served as a wake up call to those awake and aware enough to see
the obvious demolitions and misinformation and resultant Pearl Harbor
effect, most of the world fell for it.
And now people are literally bending over, as in
airport screenings, to the onslaught of police state fascism worldwide.
Its staggering. In fact, its Orwellian. The armies, police and private
sector are at war with the vague concept of terrorism - an unbeatable enemy
in a war that can be drawn out indefinitely and fought in any arena
necessary.
And what was the result of this declared war on terrorism?
Not a 'war
on terror,' but an increase in fear and terror, all to justify
the economic, social and political clampdown that has followed.
What will the
Wikileaks debacle herald?
You guessed it-the last bastion of freedom of information and expression, a
free Internet, will topple.
After all, if information is now the enemy, we
must carefully police any and every aspect of this dangerous medium-all for
the safety and protection of we the people.
Oh, well still have the Internet, just like you can still fly. Youll just
have to be on the approved list, screened, stamped, zapped, mugged and
molested if you want to get on the net. No biggie.
Thanks Julian - job well done.
Warning Signs
-
Wikileaks
WAY too approved and publicized. Every
TV and cable network, press worldwide, official recognition from
every level of government. Heck, he even does a TED talk! Wheres
anyone else trying to expose the agenda? Only Julian. Hmmm.
-
Biggie
This supposed system fighter says the
9/11 truth issue is a distraction. Mustnt step on your bosses
toes now, should we Julian.. Very suspicious if you ask me.
-
Wikileaks and Assanges sketchy
background
-
The WikiLeaks website first appeared
on the Internet in December 2006.[15][16] The site claims to
have been founded by Chinese dissidents, journalists,
mathematicians and start-up company technologists, from the US,
Taiwan, Europe, Australia and South Africa.[5]
The creators of WikiLeaks have not
been formally identified.[17] It has been represented in public
since January 2007 by Julian Assange and others. Assange
describes himself as a member of WikiLeaks advisory board.[18]
(Wikipedia)
Also, Assange reportedly wrote for both the New York Times and the
Economist which is fishy as well-not a real enlightened or
alternative mindset.
His mysterious persona also plays well
to the Wikileaks furtive image so people wont expect to know too
much, which also is very convenient for keeping anything hidden.
[NOTE: There
doesn't have to be deliberate, conscious involvement in some agenda
on Wikileaks' part, but it helps. He, they, could be 'useful idiots'
whose program has been conveniently co-opted by the controllers to
serve their purpose. Either way, look for the pattern and the
effects.]
-
Watch the hype
Theres a growing crescendo of anger and
hate that is now being whipped up-to the point that Assange is being
called a new kind of terrorist-and more disturbingly, and as
expected, the comparison is now being drawn between Assange and
Bin Laden:
-
Social Media Leaks Categorize Julian
Assange As the Osama Bin Laden Of The Internet
The founder of WikiLeaks is not only a wanted man by the
American authorities, his now infamous Web site.
WikiLeaks is also under attack by notorious hackers, while its
services are being cut-off by Amazon and EveryDNS.net. Although
not officially announced, Julian Assange might be considered
todays public enemy number-one, taking the place of the
illusive Osama bin Laden. Not since 9/11 has any one figure
reached such notoriety due to what many consider acts against a
state.
Like bin Laden, Assange has no permanent address, does not
maintain a headquarters, employs only a select few confidants
and has taken to hiding in covert areas. Younger than bin Laden,
Assange at 39 years-old may be a little more mobile than the 53
year-old, choosing to hopscotch the globe versus hibernating in
the mountains of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
While his face resides on the covers of magazines and newspapers
around the world, similar to a Wild West Wanted poster, little
is known about his day-to-day activities.
Like bin Ladens video addresses,
while the CIA and other mercenaries are seeking his
where-a-bouts, its amazing that he still finds ways to release
updates justifying his actions.
(SOURCE)
Notice also how weve been hearing about
Wikileaks exploits for a few years now, giving us time to make the
connection between it and sensational and destructive informational
terrorism.
Similarly we heard about Osama through
the Yemen and Nairobi attacks being attributed to him, imprinting
his brand on the collective mind which led to the foregone phony
conclusion that he had masterminded the 9/11 attacks.
Ah, But what about these apparent exposures? Would they attack
their own?
Could all these serious indictments against their own just be a
deflecting smokescreen to hide the real purpose? Sure worked last
time. So why wouldnt they risk taking down some of their own to
give this psychological operation credibility?
The Tactic Is Very Familiar -
Know Your Enemy
First theres the Hegelian Dialectic - create a problem, provoke a reaction
and then implement the pre-planned solution.
The
staged 9/11 attacks, including the internationally inhabited
World Trade Center, justified the ensuing wars and worldwide clampdown on
freedoms in the name of security, including the horrendous Patriot Act
that was already written and just waiting for an excuse to be signed and
implemented.
Similarly, this attack over the international Internet and drawing in
diplomatic communities worldwide by exposing state secrets from a variety of
countries will greatly help usher in international measures in the name of
security, probably spearheaded once again by the fascist US government
with coinciding EU, Canadian & Australian measures.
Its already under way with the
Department of Homeland Security confiscating websites.
All they need is the right incident to justify bringing on full control.
Like Internet Terrorism? They just cant use that term enough now, can
they.
After all, its a war on terror, and,
if youre not for us, youre for the
terrorists.
The ultimate false choice, just like everything
else they foist on the human consciousness.
Those manipulating world events belong to a cult, a brotherhood that hides
behind many names and guises, and to which they pledge their absolute
loyalty above everything, even their own flesh and blood. Commonly referred
to as
the Illuminati, this cult has an agenda
they work to fulfill using certain rituals, methods and tactics.
One of their central themes and
modus operandi is Ordo Ab Chao -
order out of chaos.
Create the chaos, pitting anyone against anyone
while controlling and fomenting both sides - hence the double headed red
phoenix symbol - for any reason, even killing or exposing their own, to
create an illogical madness that they think only they can see through and
understand. All the while they are manipulating world governments, banks,
armies and corporate leaders and drawing the net on the outcome they have
already planned.
Fear and confusion is the climate they love to foment. As long as theres a
confused and uninformed populace, the ignorant and fearful masses will be
crying out for help from the powers that be - the very powers that be
that caused all the problems in the first place.
Theyre not out to help, theyre out to control.
At any cost, by any means necessary...
