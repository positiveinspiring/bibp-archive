Sometimes it is beneficial to pause and try to
intellectually understand what the American people are fighting against.
We see the daily struggles (e.g. threats to our
pensions, bank accounts and civil liberties), however, what seems to be
missing is a narrative which provides a macro view which reveals that there
is a centralized plot designed to bring the nations of the world and its
people to its knees and then impose one centralized political and economic
authority.
I will not mince words here, this is also a classic battle between good and
evil and for now, evil is winning hands down.
You Are Playing In a Rigged
Game
Lets take a moment and examine the financial ground rules that we all live
by.
First, you need to realize that the first and
only rule of
the New World Order is that there are no
hard and fast rules of the New World Order. I understand that in order to
wrap your mind around this concept, it will require a huge paradigm shift
because you have been raised to follow a set of established rules.
This constitutes a naive world view and you need
to realize that the rules that we are made to follow were only designed by
the central bankers to keep you and me in line and to limit our ability to
collectively compete with them both financially and politically.
Even though there are no rules when we deal with the structure of the
central bankers, there are, however, two things that you can generally count
on.
Number one, most of you spend a significant
portion of your day earning money to keep the wolf from the door. Your life
is largely predicated on meeting your financial obligations so that you can
survive. This principle was established by the elite in order to keep you
working for them for your entire life.
They have built a financial system in which they
know how much to pay you and still keep you dependent on their system.
Their system is a conscious predication of
making you overpay on your home for 30 years because this keeps you working
until just before you drop dead. Also, your retirement is the carrot they
dangle in front of you for 50 years in order to keep you working for them.
For most of us, we work for peanuts in comparison to the wealth our labors
collectively generate.
On the other hand, the global elite spend their
day trying to contemplate ways to add to their bottom line and, more often
than not, your earned resources are their target. Directly, or indirectly,
you work for the global elite and they compensate you with a miniscule
fraction of what you make for the elite.
Then your financial masters concoct plots
designed to separate you from your money by using the power of government.
We see evidence of this paradigm with the
MERS mortgage fraud, stealing depositors
money, rigging the stock market and the central bankers printing their own
money so they can acquire hard assets.
Even though Americans have participated in a
rigged game, mostly since 1913 with the inception of
the
Federal Reserve, the system has minimally sustained the middle
class in this country.
However, as I have written extensively about the
economic assault against the American people over the past several weeks,
these central banksters are preparing to collapse the system and any
semblance of law and order in our financial systems will disappear.
Most Americans will prove to be easy prey to
this strategy because their collective cognitive dissonance will not permit
them to see all the danger signs.
In short, the people in our country expect our
political leaders and our captains of industry to follow the same rules that
they impose upon us and this is a grossly naive and fatal world view.
We Exist In a
Predatory, Not a Benevolent World
Have you figured this game out yet?
You are playing in a predatory game where "might
makes right" is the standing order of the day.
The
global elite constitute the hunters and your resources are the
hunted.
Every strategy, and I mean every strategy being
employed by the central bankers is geared towards the fulfillment of one
goal:
Separate the middle class from their money
and then use that money to purchase hard assets in anticipation of the
dollar collapsing, for when the smoke clears, the elite will have all
the toys and the middle class will have all the debt.
This is a classical Marxist example of total
class warfare.
However, before you judge the institutions of
the global elite, please realize that they are fighting for their very
lives.
The Food Chain
Comprising the Global Banking Empire
If you want to know who is controlling the money in the world and who has
the power to decide what direction the global economy will take, simply
follow the money to its source:
As far as can be determined, the global economy
has three players.
-
Lets call the executive directors of
this grand economic scheme, the Bank of International Settlement.
-
The second level of power is the one
that we see making decisions on a daily level.
These organizations include the global
central banks. In the United States, this group is called the
Federal Reserve Board which is an unelected cabal of private
bankers who have wrestled the financial power of this country away
from Congress and control the nations money.
If an entity controls the money, they
also control those who use their money (you and me), through the
establishment of a predatory debt enslavement system.
You learned this principle of finance as
a teenager when your parents told you,
"For as long as you live under this
house, you will do what I say."
The power of the purse determines who
controls behavior.
-
The third level of power of this unholy
system are the financial institutions of a nation. In our case in
America this would be institutions such as Goldman Sachs, other
lesser Wall Street investment houses as well as the megabanks (e.g.
Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, etc.).
Technically, there is a fourth level and that would be you, me and
the sheep of this country.
However, this group has no real power because we
have fallen victim to the global elites designed divide and conquer
strategies (e.g. gay vs. straight, citizen vs. illegal, abortion vs. right
to life, Democrat vs. Republican, etc.).
If the fourth element comprising the people
would develop a collective consciousness and some competent leadership, we
could make the first three levels of power disintegrate.
Dont hold your breath, we are all too
brainwashed by the system to achieve this level of awareness.
The BIS and Sun Tzu
Over 2,000 years ago, Chinese military
strategist, Sun Tzu, imparted a knowledge of military strategy
(The
Art of War) which is still being taught in our service academies
and in our war colleges.
One of the primary principles of Sun Tzu
consists of the concept of placing ones soldiers on "deaths ground" if you
want them to fight hard and achieve victory against all odds.
The best military example that comes to mind is
what happened to the WWII Normandy invasion force at Omaha Beach on June 6,
1944. These men were thrown onto a beach where there was no retreat
and they were only going to leave the beach dead or victorious.
The BIS has employed a Sun Tzu strategy
of placing its second level of power on deaths ground.
The BIS developed the money game that we refer to today as
futures derivatives. It is a
Ponzi scheme in which brokers quickly flip
a product or service at a greatly inflated price in the hope of a huge
profit and it does not matter if the selling price matches the real value of
the product.
The rules are to get into the game early, flip
some product and then get out before it all collapses.
As with all money games, eventually the game
quickly rolls up and only the individuals and organizations who began
the game are the only ones who make money.
When the derivatives were introduced, the second
tier of economic power on the planet (i.e. the central banks and its
financial enforcement arms) could not resist the allure of a quick financial
score.
No more patiently waiting for the 4% margin of
profit to come to fruition through wise and deliberate investing. Profits of
100%, 1000% and much more were possible by following the new money game
called derivatives.
What caused the global economy to collapse is that most developed nations
require that derivative transactions be backed by financial organizations
capable of endorsing and underwriting the transaction with their line of
credit. It is the equivalent of a parent co-signing for a car loan for their
children.
When the Ponzi scheme eventually dried up these
financial transaction guarantors were on the hook for the losses.
Hence, this is the reason that former Goldman
Sachs executive, and then, Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson told
Congress that if they did not provide the bailouts, the ensuing economic
crisis would cause massive and violent civil unrest resulting in a brutal
form of martial law.
In short, the BIS money game policies have now
placed the second tier of financial power on this planet on deaths ground
and this was all by design.
The Goal of the BIS
The overall goal of the global elite as
expressed through the BIS, is
to
establish a New World Order which means the total elimination of
the sovereign nation state which will enslave all the remaining people on
the planet.
They want a system in which they control the
economy through one dominant currency and they desire to politically control
the world through
the United Nations through such
policies as Agenda 21.
In order to achieve these goals, two objectives
must be accomplished.
-
First, the rank and file must be
economically devastated so that they will accept a global currency
along with a new set of economic policies. To accomplish this
objective, the people have to placed in such dire straits that they
will beg for relief from a relentless and crushing debt.
-
As far as the second goal, political
consolidation of the planet can only occur through WWIII in which
all of the stubborn nation state members of the planet (e.g. Russia,
China, Syria, Iran, etc.) are drawn into a war and are crushed.
Crushing the Global
Economy
As the Ponzi schemes of the derivatives market began to fail and
institutions such as Goldman Sachs were crumbling, this constituted placing
this second tier of power on deaths ground.
Institutions such as Goldman Sachs and to some
degree, the central banks were having their very existence threatened. With
a debt of at least $1 quadrillion dollars created by the derivatives, which
is 16 times greater than the entire gross product of the planet, these
institutions turned even more predatory than before in an attempt to stay
one step ahead of the burning bridge.
As a result, the American people are facing a
pack of level two wounded and desperate animals designed to steal every
financial asset that they can.
Now,
There is one other consideration in that the
second tier of financial power on this planet will eventually run out of
assets to plunder and will begin to prey upon each other.
This is the breeding ground of WWIII in which
both goals of the BIS can be accomplished.
Since
Obama failed to deliver the beginnings of WWIII by not being
able to
invade Syria, he will not likely finish his term of office. I
expect that he will be given one more chance to get us militarily into Syria
as a starting point, or a scandal (Benghazi, IRS harassment scandal, etc.)
will end his presidency.
This is why Obama needs a false flag
followed by martial law.
The Endgame is to create a pretext for
war and to eliminate all competition to his mandated views and
subsequent actions.
Prior to the commencement of WWIII, more plundering is continuing. In fact,
the IMF will soon be into your personal bank account in just another plot of
the long line of financial tyranny being imposed by the second level of
economic power on this planet.
