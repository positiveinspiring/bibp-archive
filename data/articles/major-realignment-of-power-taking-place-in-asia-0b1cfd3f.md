There has been a major change in the power
balance in Asia during the past week or so following the death of North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il, according to Asian intelligence sources.
The biggest changes are happening in Japan where
a series of arrests of bureaucrats, police officials and politicians has
begun.
One prominent casualty has been former Japanese Finance and Economy Minister
Heizo Takenaka who has been arrested and is underground vigorous
questioning, according to Japanese military intelligence sources. Takenaka
is apparently singing like a canary, the sources said.
If this information from highly placed sources
is correct, Takenaka will be explaining why he handed over control of
Japans commercial banks to foreign oligarchs, including the Rockefeller
and Bush clans. The situation in the Korean peninsula is also now headed
for the biggest change since the Korean war in the 1950s the sources say.
North Korea, as always, remains a difficult place to report about because of
the cloak of secrecy hanging over the peninsula.
However, Japanese right-wing sources, a North
Korean agent in Japan and others claim that Kim Jong Il was killed
about two years ago by a Swedish prostitute who gave him a stroke-causing
poison. Since then, a communal leadership has been ruling while using two
Kim Jong Il look-alikes.
Both look-alikes have now been killed so the
collective leadership decided to go ahead and announce the new regime with
Kim Jong Un as its nominal leader.
Two of the sources also claim that Kim Jong Un is actually the son of
Megumi Yokota, a Japanese national who was kidnapped and taken to North
Korea when she was 13. The evidence both sources cited is that Yokota was
the younger Kims companion when he was studying in Switzerland.
This author has previously heard from multiple
North Korea watchers and one North Korean opera singer that Yokota is now a
senior North Korean agent who has no wish to return to Japan.
Perhaps soon there will be enough disclosure
from North Korea to ascertain if this is true or not.
As
mentioned last week, Rothschild family sources are claiming that
North and South Korea will be unified with North Korea taking a leading role
in the new political regime. In exchange, a Rothschild central bank will be
set up in the Korean peninsula and a major development drive will take place
there. There will also be about 1 million refugees arriving there from the
United States.
The US military will also be asked to leave the
peninsula, these sources say.
One public sign of a major change has been an agreement between China and
Japan to directly trade each others currencies announced during Japanese
Prime Minister Yoshihiko Nodas visit there this week. These days about 60%
of Japan/China transactions take place via the US dollar.
In Japan, leaders of the old regime, including former Prime Ministers
Yasuhiro Nakasone and Junichiro Koizumi are said to be struggling to
maintain their power bases amidst the ongoing arrests. Many of the officials
being arrested are being charged with illegally using Bank of Japan funds
for private purposes, the sources claim.
The changes in Asia will have strong repercussions in Europe and the US in
the New Year. The Europeans are still finding it impossible to get
investments in government bonds from the rest of the world. This is why the
announcement of a 489 billion Euro infusion of money by the European Central
Bank failed to lower Italian government bond interest rates below the
unsustainable rate of 7%.
The situation among the major European and US money center banks is expected
to get critical towards the end of January when these large institutions are
supposed to settle accounts with each other.
The word from CIA officers involved in the situation is that,
-
Citibank
-
Deutschebank
-
Bank of America
-
Goldman Sachs
-
J.P. Morgan,
...may not survive.
Goldman Sachs is controlled by
J. Rockefeller, these same sources
claim.
What is certain is that there has been a fundamental split in the ranks
among the families that own the large banks that in turn own
the
Federal Reserve Board. There is still an arrogance about these
people that is difficult for the average human to fathom. They still do not
plan to go quietly into the night.
However, a Gnostic source has told the
White Dragon Society that
George Bush Senior is no longer their leader and that their
group supports White Dragon Plans for a plan to end poverty and stop
environmental destruction.
They are opposed to bloodline dynastic rule and promise major havoc in
Europe and North America next summer when the warm weather makes large
demonstrations viable.
For the year
2012 the White Dragon Society proposes a major campaign to end
poverty and stop environmental destruction followed by a huge global party.
They also propose ending the world on December 21st, 2012.
They would then restart the world on December
25th, 2012 in the old calendar by renaming it as January 1st
of the year zero. The battle to remove
the
old criminal elite will have to end in victory for humanity,
though, if we are to make this possible.
Humanity can free itself simply by deciding
collectively to do so.
