La Via Campesina (www.viacampesina.org), a global peasant
movement representing small farmers, landless workers, fisherfolk, rural
women, youth and indigenous peoples, with 150 member organizations from 70
countries on five continents, has denounced the
Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation Trusts recent acquisition of
Monsanto Company shares.
The Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation was founded in 1994 by Microsoft founder William H.
Gates, and today exerts a hegemonic influence on global agricultural
development policy. The Foundation channels hundreds of millions of dollars
into projects that encourage peasants and farmers to use Monsantos
genetically-engineered (GE) seed and agrochemicals.
In August the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which manages the $33.5 billion asset trust
endowment that funds the Foundations philanthropic projects (and to which
Bill & Melinda are trustees) disclosed that it purchased 500,000 shares of
Monsanto shares for just over $23 million.(1)
According to Dena Hoff, a diversified family farmer in Glendive, Montana and
North American coordinator of La Via Campesina,
The Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation Trusts purchase of Monsanto shares indicates that the Gates
Foundations interest in promoting the companys seed is less about
philanthropy than about profit-making. The Foundation is helping to open new
markets for Monsanto, which is already the largest seed company in the
world.
Since 2006, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has collaborated with the
Rockefeller Foundation, an ardent promoter of GE crops for the worlds poor,
to implement the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), which is
opening up the continent to GE seed and chemicals sold by,
The Foundation has given $456 million to AGRA, and in 2006
hired Robert Horsch, a Monsanto executive for 25 years, to work on the
project.
In Kenya about 70 percent of AGRA grantees work directly with
Monsanto (2), nearly 80 percent of Gates' funding in the country involves
biotech, and over $100 million in grants has been made to Kenyan
organizations connected to Monsanto.
In 2008, some 30 percent of the
Foundation's agricultural development funds went to promoting or developing
GE seed varieties (3).
In April the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and finance ministers from the
US, Canada, Spain and South Korea pledged $880 million to create the Global
Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), managed by
the World Bank to
tackle world hunger and poverty. (4)
In June GAFSP announced that it gave
$35 million to Haiti to increase smallholder farmers access to
agricultural inputs, technology, and supply chains. (5)
In May Monsanto
announced that it donated 475 tons of seed to Haiti, which is being
distributed by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). The
administrator of USAID is Rajiv Shah, who worked at the Gates Foundation
before being appointed by the Obama administration in 2009.
According to Chavannes Jean-Baptiste of the Haitian Peasant Movement of Papaye and Caribbean coordinator of La Via Campesina,
It is really shocking
for the peasant organizations and social movements in Haiti to learn about
the decision of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to buy Monsanto shares
while it is giving money for agricultural projects in Haiti that promote the
companys seed and agrochemicals.
The peasant organizations in Haiti want to
denounce this policy which is against the interests of 80 percent of the
Haitian population, and is against peasant agriculture - the base of Haitis
food production.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also funds the US governments
Feed the
Future initiative, administered by the State Department.
At a July 20
congressional subcommittee hearing on Feed the Future, executive vice
president for Monsanto Gerald Steiner testified that,
Feed the Future is
exciting not least because it recognizes both the business imperatives by
which Monsanto and other companies must operate
We want to do good in the
world, while we also do well for our shareholders.
Steiner mentioned
Monsantos project to develop drought resistant maize for Africa, also
funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.(6)
According to Hoff,
Foundations, however well meaning, should not be setting
food and agricultural policies for any nation of peoples. Democracy demands
the informed participation of civil society to determine what is in the best
interest of each nation's population. Doing well for our shareholders
seems an ulterior motive for meddling in the health and welfare of the
planet and all its inhabitants in order to make a profit.
Perhaps not by coincidence, in July Monsantos chief executive officer and
president Hugh Grant purchased $2 million of company shares, and vice
president and chief financial officer Carl M. Casale bought $1.6 million of
shares.
Grant and Casale have pocketed nice sums from selling Monsanto
shares over the years. (7)
Purchase of Monsanto shares by Gates, Grant and Casale could have been in anticipation of last weeks news that researchers
published the genome for wheat, the staple grain for one-third of the
world's population.
For Monsanto, a quality wheat genome map could
potentially help in our efforts to bring better wheat varieties to farmers,"
said Monsanto. (8)
In 2008, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded
$26.8 million to Cornell University to research wheat, and in May awarded
$1.6 million to researchers at Washington State University to develop
drought-resistant GE wheat varieties.(9)
The Gates Foundation continues to push Monsantos products on the poor,
despite mounting evidence of the ecological, economic and physical dangers
of producing and consuming
GE crops and agrochemicals.
In June the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled on Monsanto Co. vs. Geertson Seed Farms, its first case
about a GE crop. The Court recognized that genetic contamination of non-GE
crops from transgene flow of DNA from GE crops, which occurs through the
spread of pollen by wind and bees, is harmful and onerous to the environment
and farmers.
According to the web site of the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation,
AGRA and its partners have released more than 100 new varieties
of improved seed across the [African] continent. (10)
La Via Campesina maintains that the best way to ensure healthy food, adapt
to climate change, conserve soils, water and forests, and revitalize rural
economies is with policies that promote food sovereignty and small-scale,
agroecological farming systems - the foundation of which is native seed
varieties.
The United Nations estimates that 75 percent of the worlds plant
genetic diversity has been lost as farmers have abandoned native seed for
genetically-uniform varieties offered by corporations such as Monsanto.
Genetic homogeneity increases farmers vulnerability to sudden changes in
climate and the appearance of new pests and diseases, while seed agrobiodiversity
- with native seed adapted to different microclimates,
altitudes and soils - is fundamental for adapting to climate change.
Saving
and replanting native seed increases agrobiodiversity and strengthens crops
genetic plasticity (their capacity to adapt rapidly over generations to
changing growing conditions).
According to Henry Saragih, general coordinator of La Via Campesina in
Jakarta,
"La Via Campesina condemns this missappropriation of humanitarian
aid for commercial ends and the privatization of food policies"
