It is one thing for tungsten-filled gold bars to
appear in the UK, or in
Germany: after all out of sight, and across the Atlantic, certainly must
mean out of mind, and out of the safe.
However, when a 10 ounce 999.9 gold bar bearing
the stamp of the reputable Swiss Produits Artistiques Métaux Précieux (PAMP,
with owner MKS) and a serial number (serial
#038892, likely
rehypothecated in at least 10 gold ETFs across the world but that's a
different story), mysteriously emerges in the heart of the world's jewerly
district located on 47th street in Manhattan, things get real quick.
Moments ago,
Myfoxny reported that a 10-ounce gold bar costing nearly $18,000 turned
out to be a counterfeit.
The discovery was made by the dealer Ibrahim Fadl, who bought the PAMP bar in question from a merchant who has sold him
real gold before.
"But he heard counterfeit gold bars were
going around, so he drilled into several of his gold bars worth $100,000
and saw gray tungsten - not gold. The bar was filled with tungsten,
which weighs nearly the same as gold but costs just over a dollar an
ounce."
What makes so devious is a real gold bar
is purchased with the serial numbers and papers, then it is hollowed
out, the gold is sold, the tungsten is put in, then the bar is
closed up. That is a sophisticated operation.
MKS, the Swiss manufacturer of the gold
bars, said customers should only buy from a reputable merchant. The
problem, he admits, is that Ibrahim Fadl is a very reputable merchant.
Raymond Nessim, CEO Manfra, Tordell &
Brookes, said he has reported the situation to the FBI and Secret
Service. The Secret Service, which deals with
counterfeits, said it is investigating.
And cue panic on the realization that virtually
any gold bar in the world, not just those in Europe and Australia, which
have already had close encounters with Tungsten substitutes, but also New
York may be hollowed out and have a real worth of a few dollars max.
Which, sadly, is fitting considering our main
story from last night was the realization that an unknown amount of Chinese
iron ore had either never existed or had simply vaporized, and was no longer
serving as the secured collateral to various liabilities circulating in the
electronic ether.
After all, only the most naive out there could conceive of
gold being sacrosanct when every other asset class is being diluted to
infinity by a regime that has long since run out of money.
As for gold-based transactions on West 47th
street:
look for that market to grind to a halt at least for as long as it
takes for this scandal to be forgotten too.
The only open question remaining will be how
much of the gold located 90 feet below
Liberty 33 is in the same Tungstenized
format. For what it's worth: it is unlikely we will ever find out.
This is what glaring gold counterfeiting looks
like.
And for the reading challenged:

All that said, with false flags
rampant these days, we would not be surprised if this is merely yet
another attempt to discredit gold, this time physical, as an undeletable
medium of warehousing wealth.
So buyer beware: in a time when everyone is
broke, triple check before exchanging one store of wealth for another.
