Court Docs Reveal
Blackwaters Secret CIA Past
It was the U.S. militarys most notorious security
contractor - but it may also have been a virtual
extension of the CIA.
Last month a three-year-long federal prosecution
of Blackwater collapsed.
The governments 15-felony indictment - on such
charges as conspiring to hide purchases of automatic rifles and other
weapons from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives -
could have led to years of jail time for Blackwater personnel.
In the end, however, the government got only
misdemeanor guilty pleas by two former executives, each of whom were
sentenced to four months of house arrest, three years probation, and a fine
of $5,000.
Prosecutors dropped charges against three other
executives named in the suit and abandoned the felony charges altogether.

But the most noteworthy thing about the largely failed prosecution wasnt
the outcome.
It was the tens of thousands of pages of
documents - some declassified - that the litigation left in its wake.
These documents illuminate Blackwaters defense
strategy - and its a fascinating one: to defeat the charges it was facing, Blackwater built a case not only that it
worked with
the CIA - which was already widely known - but that it was in
many ways an extension of the agency itself.
Founded in 1997 by Erik Prince, heir to an auto-parts family fortune,
Blackwater had proved especially useful to the CIA in the early 2000s.
You have to remember where the CIA was
after 9/11, says retired Congressman Pete Hoekstra, who served as the
Republican chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence from 2004 to 2006 and later as the ranking member of the
committee.
They were gutted in the 1990s. They were
sending raw recruits into Afghanistan and other dangerous places. They
were looking for skills and capabilities, and they had to go to outside
contractors like Blackwater to make sure they could accomplish their
mission.
But according to the documents Blackwater
submitted in its defense - as well as an email exchange I had recently with
Prince - the contractors relationship with the CIA was far deeper than most
observers thought.
Blackwaters work with the CIA began when
we provided specialized instructors and facilities that the Agency
lacked, Prince told me recently, in response to written questions.
In the years that followed, the company
became a virtual extension of the CIA because we were asked time and
again to carry out dangerous missions, which the Agency either could not
or would not do in-house.
A prime example of the close relationship
appears to have unfolded on March 19, 2005.
On that day, Prince and senior CIA officers
joined King Abdullah of Jordan and his brothers on a trip to
Blackwater headquarters in Moyock, North Carolina, according to lawyers for
the company and former Blackwater officials.
After traveling by private jet from Washington
to the compound, Abdullah (a former Jordanian special-forces officer) and
Prince (a former Navy SEAL) participated in a simulated ambush, drove
vehicles on a high-speed racetrack, and raided one of the compounds shoot
houses, a specially built facility used to train warriors in close-quarters
combat with live ammo, Prince recalls.
At the end of the day, company executives presented the king with two gifts:
a modified Bushmaster AR-15 rifle and a
Remington shotgun, both engraved with the Blackwater logo.
They also presented three Blackwater-engraved
Glock pistols to Abdullahs brothers.
According to Prince, the CIA asked Blackwater to
give the guns to Abdullah,
when people at the agency had forgotten to
get gifts for him.
Three years later, the ATF raided the Moyock
compound (Blackwater is based in Moyock, North Carolina).
In itself, this wasnt unusual; the ATF had been
conducting routine inspections of the place since 2005, when Blackwater
informed the government that two of its employees had stolen guns and sold
them on the black market.
Typically, agents would show up in street
clothes, recalled Prince.
They knew our people and our processes.
But the 2008 visit, according to Prince, was
different.
ATF agents had guns drawn and wore tactical
jackets festooned with the initials ATF. It was a cartoonish show of
force, he said.
(Earl Woodham, a spokesman for the Charlotte
field division of the ATF, disputes this characterization.
This was the execution of a federal
search warrant that requires they be identified with the federal
agency, he says. They had their firearms covered to execute a
federal search warrant. To characterize this as anything other than
a low-key execution of a federal search warrant is inaccurate.)
During the raid, the ATF seized 17 Romanian
AK-47s and 17 Bushmaster AR-13 rifles the bureau claimed were purchased
illegally through the sheriffs office in Camden County, North Carolina.
It also alleged that Blackwater illegally
shortened the barrels of rifles and then exported them to other countries in
violation of federal gun laws.
Meanwhile, in the process of trying to account
for Blackwaters guns, the ATF discovered that the rifles and pistols
presented in 2005 to King Abdullah and his brothers were registered to
Blackwater employees.
Prosecutors would subsequently allege that
Gary Jackson - the former president of Blackwater and one of the two
people who would eventually plead guilty to a misdemeanor - had instructed
employees to falsely claim on ATF forms that the guns were their own
personal property and not in the possession of Jordanian royalty.
In all of these instances - the purchase of the rifles through the Camden
County sheriff, the shipment of the guns to other countries, and the gifts
to Abdullah - Blackwater argued that it was acting on behalf of the U.S.
government and the CIA. All of these arguments, obviously, were very much in
Blackwaters legal interest.
That said, it provided the court with classified
emails, memoranda, contracts, and photos. It also obtained sealed
depositions from top CIA executives from the Directorate of Operations,
testifying that Blackwater provided training and weapons for agency
operations. (A CIA spokesman declined to comment for this story.)
One document submitted by the defense names Jose Rodriguez, the
former CIA chief of the Directorate of Operations, and Buzzy Krongard,
the agencys former executive director, as among those CIA officers who had
direct knowledge of Blackwaters activities, in a section that is still
partially redacted.
This document is the closest Blackwater has come
to acknowledging that Prince himself was a CIA asset, something first
reported in 2010 by Vanity Fair. One of the names on the list of CIA
officers with knowledge of Blackwaters work in the document is Erik P -
with the remaining letters whited out.
This document made Blackwaters defense clear:
the CIA routinely used Blackwater in
missions throughout the world, it said.
These efforts were made under written and
unwritten contracts and through informal requests. On many occasions the
CIA paid Blackwater nothing for its assistance. Blackwater also employed
CIA officers and agents, and provided cover to CIA agents and officers
operating in covert and clandestine assignments. In many respects,
Blackwater, or at least portions of Blackwater, was an extension of the
CIA.
When I asked Prince why Blackwater would often
work for free, he responded,
I agreed to provide some services gratis
because, in the wake of 9/11, I felt it my patriotic duty. I knew that I
had the tools and resources to help my country.
Moreover, according to still-sealed testimony
described to us, the agency had its own secure telephone line and a facility
for handling classified information within Blackwaters North Carolina
headquarters.
CIA officers trained there and used an area -
fully shielded from view inside the rest of the Blackwater compound by
20-foot berms - to coordinate operations.

In the wake of the major charges being dropped, the U.S. attorney who
prosecuted the case against Blackwater, Thomas Walker, told me that
it would be wrong to dismiss the prosecution as a waste of time.
The company looks completely different now
than before the investigation, he said. For example, in 2009, Erik
Prince was the sole owner. This company now has a governing board that
is accountable.
In 2010 Prince sold Blackwater, which is now
known as
Academi, for an estimated $200 million.
Prince retains control of numerous companies affiliated with Academi, but he
told me that he had ceased providing any services to the U.S. government.
Walker would not discuss Blackwaters relationship with the CIA. But he did
say the defense that the company was acting for the government did not
excuse any violations of federal law.
Our evidence showed there was a mentality
at the company that they considered themselves above the law, Walker
said. That is a slippery slope. There came a time when there had to be
accountability at Blackwater.
David Boies, the lawyer who represented
Al Gore in Bush v. Gore, took up Gary Jacksons case last fall.
Boies told me he did so because he saw the
prosecution as an abuse of power.
These people were functioning really as an
arm of the CIA at a time when the CIAs resources were strained, he
said. I think that Erik Prince and Mr. Jackson and other people at
Blackwater thought they were being patriots.
Reflecting on the prosecution and the scrutiny
of the company he founded, Prince said the charges against Blackwater
executives left him perplexed and angry.
Blackwater carried out countless
life-threatening missions for the CIA, he said. And, in return, the
government chose to prosecute my people for doing exactly what was asked
of them.
