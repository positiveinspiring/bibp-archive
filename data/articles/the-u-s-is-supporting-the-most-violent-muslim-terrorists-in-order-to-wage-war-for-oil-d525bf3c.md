The Government,
Which Has Taken
Away Our Liberties
and Destroyed Our
Prosperity to Fight An Endless War On Terror,
Has Been Arming,
Funding and Otherwise Backing
the
'Very
Terrorists' Who Are Carrying Out Most of the Attacks
Sunni Muslims commit more terrorist acts
worldwide than any other group.
For example, the
National Counterterrorism Centers 2011 Report on Terrorism found that:
Sunni extremists accounted for the greatest number of terrorist attacks
and fatalities for the third consecutive year. More
than 5,700 incidents were attributed to Sunni extremists, accounting for
nearly 56 percent of all attacks and about 70 percent
of all fatalities.
Among this perpetrator group, al-Qaida (AQ)
and its affiliates were responsible for at least 688 attacks that
resulted in almost 2,000 deaths, while the Taliban in Afghanistan and
Pakistan conducted over 800 attacks that resulted in nearly 1,900
deaths.
Secular, political, and anarchist groups
were the next largest category of perpetrators, conducting 2,283 attacks
with 1,926 fatalities, a drop of 5 percent and 9 percent, respectively,
from 2010.
(Thankfully, the percentage of Muslim terror
attacks in the U.S. is
relatively small).
Saudi Arabia is the center of the Sunni branch
of Islam. It is also the center of the
most violent and radical sect of Islam
the Wahhabis
(also called Salafis).
But the U.S. has
long supported the Madrassa schools within Saudi Arabia which teach
radical Wahabi beliefs.
Indeed, the U.S. has directly inserted itself
into a sectarian war between the two main Islamic sects, backing the
Sunnis and attacking the Shiites (also called Shia). See
this,
this and
this.
For example, American political leaders have
been very close to Saudi (i.e. Sunni) leaders for decades:
Obama is no different:
Why? Because of Saudi oil. (Virtually all
geopolitics are based on
oil and
other hydrocarbons.)
Indeed,
-
the Co-Chair of the Congressional
Inquiry into 9/11 and former Head of the Senate Intelligence Committee
-
a former 6-year congressman and MSNBC talk show host have both said that
- even if the Saudi government was behind 9/11 -
we need Saudi oil too much to do anything about it
Our backing of the most violent branch of Sunni
Muslims has had real consequences:
* The question of
false flags is beyond the scope of this post.
And McClatchy interviewed an Al Qaeda terrorist
fighting against the Syrian government - with U.S. backing - as
saying:
When we finish with Assad, we will fight the
U.S.!
Do you still doubt that the U.S. is supporting
Sunni terrorists?
The U.S. National Security Adviser
admitted that the U.S. created, organized and armed the Mujahedeen
in Afghanistan - including Bin Laden and his lieutenants - to fight the
Soviets.
The Mujahedeen are predominately Sunni. The
Mujahedeen eventually morphed into Al Qaeda,
which is a
Sunni organization. During various times and places, the U.S. has
also
backed
the Muslim Brotherhood
another
Sunni group.
In addition, the American government has
supported:
Pulitzer prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh
reported in 2007:
In Lebanon, the [Bush] Administration has
cooperated with Saudi Arabias government, which is Sunni, in
clandestine operations that are intended to weaken Hezbollah, the Shiite
organization that is backed by Iran.
The U.S. has also taken part in clandestine
operations aimed at Iran and its ally Syria. A by-product of these
activities has been the bolstering
of Sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision of Islam and
are hostile to America and sympathetic to Al Qaeda.
And the rebels in
Syria who weve
been supporting are
Al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood.
The New York Times
reports this week:
In Syrias largest city, Aleppo, rebels
aligned with Al Qaeda control the power plant, run the bakeries and head
a court that applies Islamic law. Elsewhere, they have seized government
oil fields, put employees back to work and now profit from the crude
they produce.
Across Syria, rebel-held areas are dotted
with Islamic courts staffed by lawyers and clerics, and by fighting
brigades led by extremists. Even the Supreme Military Council, the
umbrella rebel organization whose formation the West had hoped would
sideline radical groups, is stocked with commanders who want to infuse
Islamic law into a future Syrian government.
Nowhere in rebel-controlled Syria is there a secular fighting force
to speak of.
Do you get it?
The government has taken away our liberties and
destroyed our prosperity in order to fight an endless war on terror. Americans have become
the most spied upon people in history. Never-ending war has
destroyed our economy.
And yet the government has been arming, funding
and otherwise backing the very terrorists who are
carrying out the biggest percentage of terror attacks.
As we
noted last year:
In the name of fighting Al Qaeda or
associated forces or those who support those bad guys, the U.S.
government has authorized:
In other words, the government has shredded
our constitution and destroyed our freedom and liberties in order to
fight Al Qaeda and associated forces.
And yet the government is itself supporting
- with
money, arms, and logistical support - Al Qaeda and associated forces
in a number of nations.
People who believe that were in a new
post-9/11 reality should remember that everything happening now
started before 9/11, and that current U.S.
policy towards the Middle East and North Africa was
determined many decades ago.
Its not just the Neocons who planned
this strategy.
Jimmy Carters National Security Adviser (Zbigniew
Brzezinski) helped
to
map out the battle plan for Eurasian petroleum resources over a decade
ago, and Obama is clearly
continuing the same agenda.
Sadly - by any measure - the U.S.
causes much more terror than we prevent
all to justify our
geopolitical goals.
