# Currency Reset and Gold Backed Trade Note on 2014

On Dec. 26, financial analyst and
statistician Dr. Jim Willie provided a look at major economic
events that will take place and shape the global financial system in
2014.
Of the several key changes set to occur in
how nations trade amongst one another, the two primary events, that of a
currency reset and the implementation of a gold backed trade note, will
be the catalyst for China's vision of a de-Americanized financial order.
The next year will feature many powerful
new effects.
The Indirect Exchange will become a
prominent fixture, its channel filled. It will direct many $billions
in US Treasury Bonds from large scale asset acquisitions by Eastern
and BRICS players, sent back to New York and London.
The payments for the asset purchases
will be done in
US TBonds, as the Eastern entities
dump them as fast as they can before the great devaluation.
But the biggest shock waves will come
from the currency reset followed by the introduction of the Gold
Trade Settlement. The return of
the Gold Standard is near, but it
will arrive on the trade vehicles, not the FOREX currency or SWIFT
bank platforms.
It will feature the Gold Trade Note,
used as letter of credit.

At least 23 nations have already prepared
for a new trade system that will occur outside the dollar and Swift
systems.
Through their moves away from reliance on
the dollar via the creation of new currency
swap lines, major economic powers are
transitioning away from the 42 year old petro-dollar system that saw
America devalue its currency nearly 98%, and export inflation to the
rest of the world.
A global currency reset is inevitable,
especially when you consider that the historic
life cycle of a purely fiat currency is
only 30 years, with a maximum length of 42 years. This falls in line
with the U.S. dollar which has been a purely fiat currency since
President Nixon took America off the gold standard in 1971, and
subsequently allowed the central bank to grow the economy with debt
rather than sound money and real production.
2013 will go down in history as the year of
global currency wars. But intermixed in this financial conflict will be
the rise of China, and their plans for a new financial order.
And as Dr. Willie points out in his
assessment for the coming year, when the global currency reset happens,
the vacuum that will occur will not be void for long, and will be
quickly filled by China with two new options that promise greater
stability than what the U.S. had offered for more than a decade.
Additional Information
US Dollars are Federal Reserve
Notes issued by
the private Federal Reserve Bank as
debt instruments. They're created out of thin air and backed up by
nothing, but we're charged interest for every dollar we hold, even
though the bank sacrificed nothing to issue them.
Oh yeah, they do sacrifice something...
purchasing power and the end users who are holding these debt
instruments.
Treasury Dollars are issued by the Treasury Department of the
US government, at no interest. Hopefully, they will be backed up by
silver, gold, or both. But if they are backed up by nothing... they
would still be a lot better solution than sticking with the US
Dollar by signing up for another 100 years of indentured servitude.
At least with the Treasury Dollar we
aren't going to be paying interest on the national debt, because
there won't be a national debt. Which means income taxes can go way
down, maybe to nothing, as was the case before 1913.
Hopefully the Treasury Dollar will be
backed up by precious metals. I think that it's important the
monetary system become constitutional again.
At first, the Treasury dollar will be devalued against other
currencies.
