For a long time Ive recognized that the death
of the U.S. dollar is inevitable. It is so thoroughly debauched that it
should be worthless right now, but its also such a vital instrument that
nobody can afford to let it die, at least not yet.
Moreover, as Ive learned over the years, while
its easy to predict what is going to happen thats usually just a matter
of logical deduction its nearly impossible to predict when its going to
happen. I have to admit that Ive been awed by the acumen of the
powers-that-be to keep levitated the corrupt system we have today.
I guess when you own the worlds reserve
currency, the worlds most powerful military and have a media empire in your
back pocket you can do pretty amazing things, for a while anyway.
Nevertheless, the other day I ran across an article titled,
Bank Holiday Coming? Prepare?,
that contained a quotation that left me sort of shaken.
The quotation,
attributed to Bob Chapman over at
The International Forecaster,
read,
Some US embassies worldwide are being
advised to purchase massive amounts of local currencies; enough to last
them a year. Some embassies are being sent enormous amounts of US cash
to purchase currencies from those govts, quietly. But not £s (british
pounds).
Inside
the State Dept there is a sense of sadness & foreboding that something
is about to happen, unknown re a datejust that within 180 days, but
could be 120-150 days.
As I said, for a long time Ive accepted as
inevitable the death of the U.S. dollar, and I have also anticipated an
eventual nationwide bank holiday, so stories along those lines dont work
me up into a lather anymore.
The above quotation, however, is something
completely new.
The only reason U.S. embassies would be
instructed to purchase massive amounts of other countries currencies is if
someone was anticipating that the U.S.s own currency was going to become
worthless, and as indicated in the above quotation, soon. I contacted Mr.
Chapman, for whom I have great respect and trust, and he confirmed that the
quotation cited above is his own and that he stands behind it, even a month
after writing it.
I read hundreds of articles a week, particularly about international
financial matters, and Ive been developing a growing gut feeling (not just
a growing gut) that Fall, 2009 is shaping up to be a momentous period. Fall,
2007 was a turning point, when the housing bubble audibly popped. Fall, 2008
was when the banking crises became manifest and the U.S. stock markets
peaked.
Its increasingly looking as though Fall, 2009
may yield the biggest blow up of all, the acknowledged bankruptcy of the
U.S. Government itself and the destruction of its currency.
Among the myriad tiny clues pointing to Fall, 2009, a few specific,
intriguing ones are noteworthy.
The first is from a guy named
Benjamin Fulford, who, while not exactly inspiring trust and confidence, claims to be
in contact with some of the elites running the world, and much of what he
says sounds credible.
In one of
his recent posts he wrote,
The US financial system may not collapse until September 30th of this year,
according to our latest intelligence. A new, precious-metals backed system
is in place but a split at the highest levels of the US secret government in
preventing its implementation.
Note the date he cites: September 30.
Bob Chapmans quote
I dont
believe Bob and Benjamin travel in the same circles, making their
statements independent was from his May 20 newsletter.
One-hundred-twenty days from Bobs May 20 newsletter is roughly
September 20.
At the outside, one-hundred-eighty days from May 20 is
roughly November 20. In addition,
I have long speculated that a
gold-backed currency might be introduced to replace the U.S. dollar, so
Benjamins inclusion of that tidbit concurs with my own speculation,
giving it more credibility in my opinion.
Then there is a group named
LEAP/E2020,
independent from both Bob Chapman and
Benjamin Fulford, which
cites
September/October, 2009 as the date of inception of major upheaval:
On the contrary, because the origins of the
crisis remain unaddressed, we estimate that the summer 2009 will be
marked by the converging of three very destructive « rogue waves » (2),
illustrating the aggravation of the crisis and
entailing major upheaval
by September/October 2009.
Specifically, they anticipate debt defaults by
the U.S. and U.K. governments and a Wave of terminal crisis for the US
Dollar, US T-Bond and GBP. (Recall from Bobs quote above that the U.S.
embassies are not to buy British pounds.)
Since the U.S. Government must borrow one half
of its annual budget today, amounting to $1.8 trillion of borrowing in a
single year, what will happen if it is unable to raise that sum? The U.S.
Government currently spends approximately half a trillion dollars annually
on debt service. If it cannot borrow the money to service that debt, then a
default will occur. If it resorts to printing money to service the debt,
then thats simply a disguised form of default which would hasten the U.S.
dollars demise.
The formerly inconceivable notion of a U.S.
Government debt default is no longer inconceivable.
Then there is this article, titled The Hammer Drops (below insert),
by Douglas McIntosh, who also cites Fall, 2009 as an ominous date.
Referring to a coming wave of state and local government fiscal crises
beginning after July 1, 2009, he writes,
The Feds will follow them starting on
October 1st, the beginning of the new Federal fiscal year 2010.
Then there is the mystery of the
Japanese
couriers carrying $134.5 billion in U.S. bonds, which certainly seems
consistent with an imminent demise of the U.S. dollar.
I mean, if you were an insider and knew that
the dollar was about to expire, wouldnt you take steps to protect yourself
by quietly getting rid of your dollars?
Additionally, the article that referenced Bob
Chapmans newsletter cited above included this interesting sentence, also
relating to Japan,
Bob quotes another source that Panasonic
has told their people to be back in Japan by Sept 09.
In my reading, I have run across many diverse
clues from independent sources, most of them tiny, but collectively creating
an ominous pattern that appears ready to visibly emerge in the fall of 2009,
between the end of September and the end of November.
To tell the truth, I honestly hope Im wrong and
that things just keep going the way they are going, for even I have no idea
how to cope with a currency that suddenly becomes worthless.
