"Let Purpose guide the little wills of
men".
It is not a coincidence that we are
celebrating both the 50th anniversary of
the Great Invocation and
the United Nations. Both in
different ways are pivotal to the Plan and much as yet remains to be
done before the purpose of either can be fully realized. Let us
therefore utilize our opportunity today and continue to hold and
deepen the group's spiritual tension.
Let us together, complete the triangle
of light, love and power and from this vantage point, let us
contemplate that world body - "the hope of humanity" - which was
conceived just 50 years ago under the impulse of the three spiritual
Festivals.
(falling on March 28th, April 27th
and May 26th)
As the dream that arose from a nightmare, it
gave hope to the world at a time when people were in despair. Pronouncing an
end to the scourge of war and envisioning a world of justice, peace and
progress for all peoples of the earth, the United Nations has been called
humanity's most far-sighted and significant undertaking.
It was on April 25, 1945 two days previous to the full moon of Taurus
and the Festival of Wesak that delegates from 50 nations, met in San
Francisco for a conference known officially as the United Nations
Conference on International Organization.
Appalled at the atrocities they had witnessed and the hell they had
undergone, their mission was to create an organization that would forever
end the scourge of war and serve as a mechanism for future peace.
Of this period the
Tibetan Master tells us:
"Not for nothing is this conference being
held during the five days of the Wesak Full Moon. It will be a time of
supreme difficulty, in which the Forces of Light will face...'the forces
of selfishness and separativeness.'"
(The Externalization of the Hierarchy)
The Hierarchy kept a keen vigilance over
the events of this period and especially over the conference in San
Francisco which was of such significance that it called forth the attention
of those great lives in Shamballa.
We are told that,
"Year after year, ever since the Buddha
achieved His goal of illumination, an effort has been made to increase
the flow of enlightenment into the world and to throw the light of
wisdom, experience and understanding into the minds of men. At each Full
Moon of May this has been the effort of the spiritual Forces which are
working out the Will of God."
In 1945, a supreme effort was made during the
five days of the Full Moon from April 25 to April 30. At that time a great
Triangle of Force was created as the nucleus through which the Forces of
Enlightenment could work.
The three Lives controlling that released energy
were:
-
The Light of Life Itself; the Lord of
the World
-
The Buddha, the Lord of Wisdom, bringing
spiritual light to the Hierarchy and revealing what is the divine
purpose
-
The Christ, the Lord of Love, presenting
the demand of humanity and acting as the distributing Agent for the
Forces of Enlightenment.
(The Externalisation of the Hierarchy)
The conference was also under the subjective
influence of the Hierarchy who we are told were facing a major test of Their
hierarchical power - not a test of their love, but of their power. (ExtH p.
450)
The consequent stimulation which effected both
the unselfish as well as the selfish aspects of humanity was of such potency
that it would determine the destiny of humanity for centuries to come.
For almost nine weeks the Conference went on - nine weeks of intensive work,
day and night, by hundreds of delegates, advisors, translators, and more;
and, at the end, the mission was accomplished: the final version of the
10,000-word Charter of the United Nations was approved and passed
unanimously late in the evening of June 25th. Four months later, on October
24th, after the necessary ratification signatures, the United Nations
officially came into existence.
Uncertainty about the outcome of the conference gripped both the Center of
Light and the Center of Love:
-
Could the little wills of men and women
and the love-wisdom of Hierarchy be aligned with the purpose of
Shamballa?
-
Would the disciples of the world and the
members of the new group of world servers be able to call forth the
will-to-good sufficiently so that the Forces of Light would
predominate?
-
Would the energy of goodwill swell
within the hearts of men and women so as to significantly impact
public opinion?
The precarious, touch and go nature of the event
is described by a U.S. delegate to that conference who tells us that,
"the cynics, the negators, the doubters, [and]
the Armageddonites, among the public and... the media, were strident in
their assertions that the 50 nations could never be brought to agreement
and that a third world war by 1970 or 1975 was inevitable".
He then gives the following account of how the
tide was turned:
"As we began...regular explanations to the
media and to nongovernmental representatives who increasingly came to
San Francisco, public sentiment began to swing in a hopeful manner.
Virginia Gildersleeve, one of the eight-member delegation from the
United States, came forward with the preamble concept of 'We the
People'. [From then on] progress in our work and in public opinion
accelerated to the point where all 50 delegations agreed unanimously and
signed on June 26.
(Harold Stassen, New Realities
Conference, 1993)
So it was that divine purpose was able to guide
the little wills of men.
Fifty years into its existence, what can we say about the working out of
that purpose through the UN today? I'm reminded here of a passage from the
Agni Yoga book, Supermundane, wherein Master Morya refers to the ceaseless
Battle the Hierarchy leads against the forces of darkness.
Therein he says:
"We may receive communications that a
conspiracy against constructiveness has developed and we hasten to
prevent it, but you yourself know how few listen to us".
(par. 45, p. 78)
So it seems to me is the plight of the United
Nations today. So many good works, so many enlightened intentions, so many
fine achievements and so few people to sing its praises or appreciate the
significance and potential of this world body.
Yet, the accomplishments are there and they are many.
For our purposes here,
I'd like to have us consider just a fractional sampling of these. First on
that list has to be the fact of its sheer existence: a synthetic global body
where the center, humanity, under one roof, is represented in its great
diversity and multiplicity - one synthetic body which over the years has
increasingly recognized the interdependent nature of not only humanity, but
of all life on our planet.
Next on that list must be The Universal Declaration of Human Rights which
declares that all people should act towards one another in a spirit of
brotherhood. Via this Declaration, the United Nations has provided humanity
for the first time ever with a collective, global conscience.
Often without attracting attention, the UN and its family of agencies are
engaged in a vast array of work that touches every aspect of peoples' lives
around the world. For example, it works at alleviating chronic hunger and
rural poverty in developing countries. It has generated a worldwide
commitment in support of the needs of especially children and refugees. It
is the eyes and ears of our global environment.
It works to strengthen international law and it
was a major factor in bringing about the downfall of the apartheid system in
South Africa; it works to reduce the effects of natural disasters and fights
drug abuse, it promotes worker's rights and the UN even makes possible our
international mail.
Is the UN perfect? Has it fulfilled the purpose for which it was founded? Of
course, the answer is a resounding "NO".
Recognizing, for example, that about 1.3 billion of us live in absolute
poverty, that only 10% of us participate fully in the institutions that
shape our lives and that close to one trillion dollars a year are spent for
military purposes, we can plainly see that our world is neither just nor at
peace and progress for all the peoples of the earth as the Charter promises
- is at best, a remote dream.
From the outset it was hoped that this great "experiment" - as it is
referred to - would bring about the liberation of humanity into a new era of
peace, justice and cooperation; that it would demonstrate the potency of
such spiritual values as practical love and understanding by insuring that
the basic needs of all for food, housing and health care would be met
through the collective sharing of the physical, economic and cultural
resources of the planet.
Through the General Assembly of the UN, under the influence of the Avatar of
Synthesis and the Forces of Reconstruction it was hoped that the theory of
unity could slowly be turned into practice, and that the word "United" could
come to have a true significance and meaning. (The Reappearance of the
Christ, p. 93)
No, the UN has not yet realized the purpose for which it was founded.
However, with all its faults, limitations, weaknesses and nationalisms, the
United Nations according to the Tibetan Master is focusing the conflict
between the Angel and the Dweller. He further says that The United Nations
are... gradually and most decisively throwing the weight of their effort and
aspiration on to the side of the Angel, thus restoring the lost balance and
slowly producing on a planetary scale those attributes and conditions which
will eventually dispel illusion, dissipate glamour and devitalize the
prevalent maya.
This they are doing by the increased clear
thinking of the general public of all the nations,...by their growing
ability to conceive ideas in terms of the whole...and [by] their capacity to
discriminate between the Forces of Light and the potency of materialism.
(Glamour A World Problem, p. 163)
At the time that the UN was being contemplated, The Tibetan Master
emphasized how essential it was for all aspirants and disciples to throw the
weight of their spiritual development and the light of their souls on the
side of the Forces which were attempting to plan for the good of humanity as
a whole rather than for any one particular nation. That same resounding need
exists today.
It is at this juncture that our work here today and over the coming years
becomes so crucial. Eleanor Roosevelt reminded the public of her day that
"The United Nations is a piece of machinery and the people of the world must
make it work".
That same thought has recently been expressed by the current
Secretary-General of the United Nations who said:
"At this moment the first words of the
Charter, "We the Peoples of the United Nations" convey a meaning
originally intended but perhaps never before fully comprehended. We - all
of us - are the United Nations. The UN is...what we choose to make of it.
"
(Boutros Boutros-Ghali Message in the
UN50 Press Kit)
The Tibetan Master reminds us that it is the
demand of the disciples of the world which will bring in that which the
world needs. (Discipleship In the New Age, Vol. I, pp. 297/8)
What is needed
today is for the purpose which the Masters know and serve to increasingly
guide the little wills of men.
Purpose - the magnetized line along which the fire may travel. Purpose - the
motivating life behind all that emanates from Shamballa, that which impulses
all the activities of the Hierarchy and that which implements the Plan.
Within Shamballa, it is the Registrants of Purpose - as they are called -
who keep the channel open between our Earth, the planet Venus and the
Central Spiritual Sun.
We are told that the basic purpose of Sanat Kumara is to bring about right
relations in every field of his manifested life. And, although an elementary
revelation of the divine Purpose is possible only at the 3rd initiation, the
encouraging factor is that the activity of humanity itself, for the first
time, is concerned with the entire subject of right human relations and how
to bring it about. (The Rays and the Initiations p. 394)
Through our attempts at world understanding, our demand for unity, and our
intent to dynamically "force" the energy of the will-to-good into the world,
we can significantly aid in the work of the UN. It is this focused
will-to-good which can and must evoke the Shamballa energy - the only energy
that can overcome the opposing forces which would obstruct the spiritual
progress of humanity.
As it is manifested, the average man and woman
responding unconsciously will then express the energy of goodwill.
The particular genius of each nation within the United Nations can then be
evoked for the enriching of the entire human family and human brotherhood
can become a realized accomplishment.
I would like to end by having us reflect on the following thought from
The Externalization of the Hierarchy which underlines this role of the
United Nations:
When the United Nations has emerged into factual and actual power, the
welfare of the world will then be assured.
-
What is that welfare but love in action?
-
What are right human relations but love
among men, groups and nations?
-
What is international cooperation but
love on a world scale?
Those are the things which the love of
God
in Christ expressed, and those are the things which we are working
here today to bring into being. We are attempting to do it on a vast scale,
and this in spite of opposition - an opposition which can only temporarily
succeed, such is the potency of the awakened spirit of man.
These are the things which the Hierarchy, in its
already successful procedures, is aiding and will continue to aid.
(p. 603)
So let us once again affirm the invocation:
"Let purpose guide the little wills of men".
