I am lately reminded of an assignment when my
metro editor sent me to cover a gentle protest over the Gulf War of the
1990s in Jackson, Mich.
(Dont remember that war - or what it was about?
Thats OK - because it was probably security and oil, and
George W.
ultimately righted his dads failure to see that war action through to its
completion: killing Saddam Hussein, or at least dismantling his government.
But I digress.)
It was an after-hours event, likely on a weekend (as that was my beat). And
when I arrived at the designated time, well after sundown, I found one lone
woman walking the length of a wall at an armory or similar government-type
outpost with, not a flashlight, but a real, flickering candle. Back and
forth, in the dark, trudging in the snow.
No one else had shown up - except me, that is.
The place was deserted and,
as I recall, not on a busy road. I actually had to drive by twice before I
even saw her candle and a small chair she set up for herself when she got
tired. It occurred to me that, if I walked away, it would have been the same
as if shed never been there at all. Yet, incontrovertibly, there she was:
protesting a war that, at the time, no one was particularly riled up about.
It wasnt a story, really.
But I decided to speak with her anyway. I walked with her for about an hour
and asked questions. Apart from understanding that my editors expected my
story for the next days edition, I also sensed that there could be a story
to tell - and that, if I didnt, no one might ever consider an opposing view
that, while solitary, might be worth listening to.
Id have to dig through years of clips to find that story now. (Im sure it
resides in the Jackson Citizen Patriot morgue). But its not the story
thats important to me now.
Its that I covered it at all - and that my editors were grateful I did. And
that readers seemed to value the fact we were there to capture a moment in
their community they would otherwise not have known about.
MORE THAN A WEEK AGO, a small band of peaceful protesters descended on
Zuccotti Park (formerly Liberty Park) in New York City, not far from Wall
Street. They dubbed their little movement Occupy Wall Street.
And, on the
first weekend, starting Sept. 17, they had quite a number of people join
them in marches and speeches that essentially claimed the 99% of Americans
who arent the 1% of uber-rich are disenfranchised - and have critical needs
related to unemployment, cost of living, and a range of other social issues
that are either being ignored outright or largely swept under the rug by our
finance-focused government.
These young people, accompanied by like-minded Xers and a few Boomers,
didnt get much coverage to start. (I doubt any authentic movement, at the
outset, ever does.)
The media that did arrive briefly aired the same
complaint:
They are a loosely organized group of disaffected youth who are
more like hippies and have no real goal, they yawned. Nothing to see here,
but weve done our job by covering it in our blogs, they seemed to say to
New Yorkers and anyone outside the Big Apple paying attention. This too
shall pass.
The only problem is, it hasnt. And I suspect after this weekend, it isnt
going to.
Now in its 10th day, protestors are very much entrenched at Zuccotti Park
(with people across the United States and around the world watching their
activities via live-streaming video, as well as sending them supplies and
money, even pizza via local vendors).
This past Saturday afternoon, there
was a large march to Union Park, through Washington Square (and, at times,
through moving traffic - which was pretty incredible to watch in real time)
- and all seemed to be going well with chants and songs as the trek was
covered by Occupy Wall Streets new media team, such as the young woman Net
followers dubbed 50/50 Anchor Lady, with hair that was half blonde, half
brownish-black.
As I say, all was well - that is, until a phalanx of NYC police moved in and
started making mass arrests.
Twitter was the only way most of us knew it
actually happened; the media team, scarily, was picked off shortly after the
march gained momentum near Washington Park.
Its not like no one was aware the police were coming. I myself could hear
what was going down on the police scanner, which I alternately monitored
while toggling back and forth between live-streaming and searching for news
updates on Google.
The tension was building - you could feel it while watching from hundreds of
miles away as the protestors kept dodging orange fencing and an increasingly
ominous presence of officers. The marchers were peaceful - but resolute in
their efforts to keep marching.
Then, right in the thick of things, the live-streaming ended just before the
mass arrests and some disturbing instances of outright police brutality
(documented and later distributed via cellphone photos).
But, I should note,
not before the world had already witnessed some of those protestor/cop
encounters. It was shocking, actually, to watch people pushed with real
force or slammed to the ground when, to my eye, they hadn't provoked
anything remotely requiring that kind of police-state response.
I had been one of the hundreds, then thousands, to witness the march from
nearly beginning to end - and that was not how Id expected things to turn
out. But, almost on cue (as if to underscore the government's fear this
would spread), things escalated quickly and publicly in the glaring view of
the Twitterverse, very likely to the chagrin of the NYPD, Michael Bloomberg
and anyone on Wall Street who didnt want this little movement to earn
attention or gain credibility.
Within a matter of minutes, thousands of people were logging into the
live-streaming site or retweeting the police presence.
Yet, the media still
werent covering the event, except as an aside, almost. I recall the Village
Voice reported on several key tweets from Occupy Wall Street - laudable in
providing real time updates, but I never could tell if they sent an actual
reporter to the site at the time. (Back in the day, my own editors would
have pushed me out the door. And sent back-up reporters.)
Not to be flip, but if 60-80 people were arrested for dog-fighting, or for
wrangling outside a tony nightclub, or protesting at the United Nations,
that might have gotten coverage. Im pretty sure that would have received
some attention.
But this: In my humble opinion, it got very little.
Some,
finally - but people had to be hurt, and the police department's reputation
tarnished, when neither was necessary if the media were operating as it
should.
Since then, media coverage has been defensive. (Said one reporter, and Im
paraphrasing here: Its not fair to say Occupy Wall Street hasnt been
covered. And then a short list of stories was included to prove the point.)
And the coverage has been light: I was impressed Keith Olbermann, Rachel
Maddow and even Stephen Colbert have noted this is more than dismissive
hippy-ism; but no major news organization has (to the best of my knowledge)
paid more than the barest attention thus far.
Why?
Perhaps its because no one wants a popular movement or peaceful rebellion
to spread at a time when many Americans are fed up with their dysfunctional
government leaders.
We have enough problems, the leaders and media friends
might be thinking: Why stir the pot?
Perhaps its because they sense, as does Bloomberg, that once a train like
this gets going, it can be hijacked by the wrong people and cause real
damage. (That, alone, is worthy of another story altogether.)
But is that a
reason to quell coverage, really?
In the end, though, a large-scale failure to acknowledge and cover this
small group of protestors - now growing in numbers, thanks to outrage at
the rough-housing NYPD, and quickly propagating similar groups in other
cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., etc. - is akin to a
media blindness.
The medias job is not to turn a blind eye. The medias job is to report.
Period.
Which is yet another reason why Americans are not trusting the
modern media. And I have to say, given what Ive witnessed in recent days in
and around Zuccotti Park, that I clearly understand why my profession is
much maligned these days.
If people are there, and they have something worthwhile to say - regardless
of whether it is popular or potentially alarming or against the political
status quo - it is news. Good reporters should be covering it, regardless of
their personal political preferences - and let Americans come to their own
conclusions.
Is it a media blackout?
Sure seems that way to me. If I can cover one voice about a Gulf War, and
contribute to societys understanding of our greater human experience, then
the media can certainly begin paying attention to thousands of marchers -
and what appears to be the beginnings of an American movement.
I would call upon our news organizations to acknowledge their collective
mistake in ignoring this story, remember that their calling is higher than
the profit motive, and begin covering news that engages our thinking skills.
America needs the media now more than ever.
To find it absent, while the
entire world is watching this unfolding and increasingly important story
(and they are) is a travesty and a statement about how far we have fallen as
a nation built on freedom of speech and thought.
These are voices worth hearing at this time of trouble and strife. Hundreds
of those voices are gathering in New York and other cities right now,
representing diverse people and backgrounds and views - and trying to send a
message that change, Real Change, must happen.
I want to hear what they have to say. As an American, I need to hear. As a
media consumer, I demand to hear.
Don't you?
