UN Official: Clear evidence Rumsfeld ordered
torture
by David Edwards
United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture Manfred Nowak told CNNs
Rick Sanchez that the U.S. had an obligation to investigate whether
Bush administration officials ordered torture.
Nowak believes that there is already enough
evidence to prosecute Donald Rumsfeld.
We have clear evidence. In our report that
we sent to the United Nations, we made it clear that former Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld clearly authorized torture methods and he was
told at that time by Alberto Mora, the legal council of the Navy, Mr.
Secretary, what you are actual ordering here amounts to torture. So,
there we have the clear evidence that Mr. Rumsfeld knew what he was
doing but, nevertheless, he ordered torture.
