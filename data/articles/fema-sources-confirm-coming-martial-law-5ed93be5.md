WMR (Wayne Madsen) has learned from
knowledgeable Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
sources that
the Bush administration is putting the
final touches on a plan that would see martial law declared in the United
States with various scenarios anticipated as triggers.
The triggers include a continuing
economic collapse with massive social unrest, bank closures
resulting in violence against financial institutions, and another fraudulent
presidential election that would result in rioting in major cities and
campuses around the country.
In addition, Army Corps of Engineer sources report that the assignment of
the 3rd Infantry Divisions 1st Brigade Combat Team (BCT) to
the Northern Commands U.S. Army North is to augment FEMA and federal law
enforcement in the imposition of traffic controls, crowd control, curfews,
enhanced border and port security, and neighborhood patrols in the event a
national emergency being declared.
The BCT was assigned to duties in Iraq before
being assigned to the Northern Command.
On April 3, 2008, WMR reported on a highly-classified document regarding the
martial law scenario: WMR has learned from knowledgeable sources within the
US financial community that an alarming confidential and limited
distribution document is circulating among senior members of Congress and
their senior staff members
that
is warning of a bleak future for the United States if it does
not quickly get its financial house in order.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is among those
who have reportedly read the document.
The document is being called the "C &
R" document because it reportedly states that if the United States
defaults on loans and debt underwriting from China, Japan, and Russia, all
of which are propping up the United States government financially, and the
United States unilaterally cancels the debts, America can expect a war that
will have disastrous results for the United States and the world.
"Conflict" is the "C word" in the
document.
The other scenario is that the federal
government will be forced to drastically raise taxes in order to pay off
debts to foreign countries to the point that the American people will react
with a popular revolution against the government.
"Revolution" is the documents "R word."
