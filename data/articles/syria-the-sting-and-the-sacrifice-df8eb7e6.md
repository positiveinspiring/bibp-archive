The world is awakening at an exponential rate, thanks largely to
Washingtons war mongering madness despite world wide outcries. The more
they push, the more galvanized the awakening becomes.
Apparently their efforts are about to reach a frenzied crescendo. That or
their drunken spree in the face of global protests would make no sense
whatsoever. These idiots are clearly itching to let it fly.
A false flag here, a hyped-up false accusation there, and then theyll do
the big nasty show down. No way theyre going to back down on their march to
Iran and WW3, sorry to say.
Theyre mad. But the wake up is getting plenty of driving wind for its sails
of conscious awareness.
And thats always a good thing. Just beware of the threatened raptor. Its
vicious and does not act rationally, despite its paralyzing pretense to do
otherwise on perhaps a few politically and militarily camouflaged occasions.
Ahem.
Heres the gambit.
In their minds theres no problem with the UK Parliament voting down
participation and other powers being on the fence at this time. Once Iran
jumps in, or Israel takes some serious hits, itll be all in for the UK and
anyone else of import who may have hesitated.
Align with the overbearing aggressor or be aggressed upon. Again...
Another Sacrificial Rite
Not to say Israel has any vested interest in this conflagration taking
place, but hear me out about the most inhospitable
neighbor anyone could dread.
Before we go on any further with our easily lucid argument, coincidentally
Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year and the beginning of the high
holy days leading up to Yom Kippur, is coming up quick on September
5 and 6 this year.
Not far behind it beginning on September 13th
and ending the next day is the said Yom Kippur, the highly celebrated day
of atonement, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar.
This day of atonement has always been typified by animal, and human,
sacrifice and the sprinkling of blood.
Now get the connection between the two holidays:
According to Jewish tradition, God inscribes
each persons fate for the coming year into a book, the Book of Life, on
Rosh Hashanah, and waits until Yom Kippur to seal the verdict.
During the Days of Awe, a Jewish person
tries to amend his or her behavior and seek forgiveness for wrongs done
against God (bein adam leMakom) and against other human beings (bein
adam lechavero). The evening and day of Yom Kippur are set aside for
public and private petitions and confessions of guilt (Vidui).
At the end of Yom Kippur, one hopes that
they have been forgiven by God.

Days of Awe ring a bell?
as in Shock and Awe?
Included in this supposed reflection and personal atonement is a strangely
evil Talmudic Zionist teaching, by those perpetrating whatever act of horror
or high strangeness for the defense of and promulgation of Zionism, no
matter the cost, damage and collateral effect, is pardoned ahead of time
during an ominous religious ceremony at the beginning of each year.
Kol Nidre... is an Aramaic declaration recited in the synagogue
before the beginning of the evening service on every Yom Kippur, the Day of
Atonement.
Though not a prayer, this dry legal formula and
its ceremonial accompaniment have been charged with emotional undertones
since the medieval period, creating a dramatic introduction to Yom Kippur on
what is often dubbed Kol Nidrei night.
It is written in Aramaic, not Hebrew. Its name
is taken from the opening words, meaning all vows.
Kol Nidrei has had an eventful history, both in itself and in its
influence on the legal status of the Jews. Introduced into the liturgy
despite the opposition of some rabbinic authorities, it was attacked in the
course of time by some rabbis and in the 19th century expunged
from the prayer book by many communities of western Europe.
Actual vow:
All [personal] vows we are likely to
make, all [personal] oaths and pledges we are likely to take between
this Yom Kippur and the next Yom Kippur, we publicly renounce.
Let them all be relinquished and
abandoned, null and void, neither firm nor established. Let our
[personal] vows, pledges and oaths be considered neither vows nor
pledges nor oaths.
The leader and the congregation then say
together three times,
May all the people of Israel be
forgiven, including all the strangers who live in their midst, for
all the people are in fault.
(quoting Numbers 15:26.)
The leader then says:
O pardon the iniquities of this people,
according to Thy abundant mercy, just as Thou forgave this people
ever since they left Egypt.
And then the leader and congregation say
together three times,
The Lord said, I pardon them according
to your words.
(quoting Numbers 14:20).
The Torah scrolls are then replaced, and the
customary evening service begins.

Yes, one of the darkest, ugliest truths youll
ever run into; virtually a premeditated exploitation, torture and murder
vow.
Youll find similarly cloaked and non cloaked incantations in occult satanic
doctrines and ceremonies everywhere, from the Mossad to
the Jesuits,
ancient
secret societies still active today to the the darkest satanic rituals.
Those involved in these murderous acts against
the innocent have been pardoned ahead of time.
Not really necessary
for a
psychopath to take action, but a nice way to encourage the troops to get at
it and never mind any twinges of conscience, all while adding an extra dose
of vibrational blood lust.
In fact, well displayed throughout Talmudic teachings.
What they teach is
that
anyone except their own kind are lesser beings akin to animals there
for their use, abuse, slaughter and even consumption.
Every Jew, who spills the blood of the
godless (non-Jews), is doing the same as making a sacrifice to God.

The Simple Truth - The
War On Syria Was Set in Motion Years Years Ago
Long term planning has always been in effect. Nothing of public geopolitical
importance is spontaneous, democratically decided or accidental.
In this excellent piece including a terrific expose of the Syrian chemical
attack lies, this
poignant clip by Col Wesley Clark weve seen for
years tells the tale. If youve never seen it or havent passed it on, nows
the time:
Endgame - Baiting the Trap
for Global Hegemony
An excellent piece
posted on PressTV today on this subject
ends with the following practically rhetorical challenge:
Are Americans aware that Washington is
conducting military exercises all over the world, is surrounding Russia
and China with military bases, and now has an Africa Command?
Have Congress and the American people signed
off on Amerika Uber Alles? Shouldnt Washington and the
military/security complex be reined in before Washingtons aggression
triggers a nuclear war?
The Russians and Chinese have both clearly
warned the American led cabal that action on Syria will have dire
consequences.
To go ahead with this plan is as insane as the
idea that Assad would launch a chemical attack, not only fulfilling
Washingtons projected meme, but on the very the day UN inspectors arrive.
You cant make this stuff up.
More than that. The IAs - Insane Aggressors - know Syria and Iran have a
defense treaty. If one is attacked the other will come to its rescue. Now
wouldnt that be convenient.
The problem again is,
what
psychopathic reason could they come up
with to justify on the world stage such a massive move on potentially
both countries?
Yes. A
mega
false flag of unspeakable horror. One that would make 9/11 look
like childs play.
Theyre well capable of such a horrific act.
They Know Whats Going On
The one good thing to come of all this is the awakening its catalyzing.
And right on cue out of the reptoid mouth of CFR
mainstay 'Zbigdeal Blowzinski' comes his reminder of their thorns in
the side:
During a short interview with Germanys DW News last Monday, former US
National Security Adviser and
Trilateral Commission co-founder
Zbigniew Brzezinski commented on the growing inefficiency of
war due to the increased political knowledge of the public.
Given the contemporary reality of what I have called in my writings
Global Political Awakening, a policy of force based primarily on
Western and in some cases former colonial powers does not seem to me
a very promising avenue to an eventual solution to the regional
problem, said Brzezinski, referring to the situation in Syria. -

Despite Brzezinskis
noted long-term relationship with Obama which included
a top foreign policy adviser position, Brzezinski denied any specific knowledge of his plans regarding Syria, saying that if the administration has a strategy,
its a very well-kept secret.

This of course hails back to the classic
previous mention of the problem of a global awakening, followed by his
chilling instructions to all listeners,
Today... it is infinitely easier to kill a
million people than to control a million people.
If youre not familiar with the
Council on Foreign Relations or the Neocons, Zionism or
the depopulation agenda et al, those terms are free for the
searching.
Well worth serious time investment and they will
lead you down many an intriguing, enlightening and empowering rabbit hole.
The Darkest Hour is Before
Dawn
Even more war is at our doorstep.
Too much has been invested and put into place.
Hopefully it can be partially aborted if enough world powers force a stand
down, but the potential for escalation into a much greater conflagration is
ever before us.
Do prepare but keep doing what you can to help expose this perfidy. Every
bit of truth about the agenda that is brought into conscious awareness makes
a big difference - and one truth leads to another
and another..
Keep on. They may look like the dominant force, but they are having to react
to us now.
We are the true power. Darkness cannot stand the light. All they can do is
rage against it.
Dont fear. Stay in love.
