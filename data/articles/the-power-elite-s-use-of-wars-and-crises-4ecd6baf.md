When Congressional Reece Committee research
director Norman Dodd's legal assistant Kathryn Casey looked at the planning
documents for the founding of the Carnegie Endowment, she found something
quite revealing.
She found that they determined war would be helpful in
furthering their objectives. Relevant to this, Rene Wormser in FOUNDATIONS:
THEIR POWER AND INFLUENCE (1958) wrote that the head of the endowment,
Nicholas Murray Butler, used the endowment's funds to get the U.S. into
World War I.
The year after the endowment was founded in 1910, Robert Minor's cartoon in
the ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH in 1911 depicted members of the power elite
(John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, J.P Morgan, etc.) welcoming Karl Marx
and his "socialism" to Wall Street. The next year Woodrow Wilson ran for
president, and his "handler" for the power elite, Colonel Edward M. House,
assured his bosses that Wilson would support
the Federal Reserve's
establishment in 1913.
The year after that (1914), the power elite arranged the first World War
long before the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28 by
members of the
Narodna Odbrana (Black Hand) secret society.
On May 29,
Colonel House in Berlin wrote to President Wilson:
"Whenever England
consents, France and Russia will close in on Germany and Austria."
The trick
would be to make Germany think England would not enter the war. This was
done by British Secretary of State Sir Edward Grey misleading German
Ambassador to England Prince Karl Max Lichnowsky. Grey was close to the
(Lord Alfred) Milner Group which was executing power elite member Cecil
Rhodes' plan for world government.
Milner was the power behind the scenes in British government. He, not Prime
Minister David Lloyd George, actually ran British foreign affairs. Milner
was favorably disposed to Marxian socialism, and pro-Bolshevist Sir Basil
Zaharoff (an armaments dealer who had sold arms to both sides in several
wars) was consulted by President Wilson and Prime Minister George before any
major military operation.
This is according to author Donald McCormick, who
said Zaharoff sought to divert munitions away from anti-Bolshevists.
When World War I began, Helmuth Johannes Ludwig von Moltke was head of the
German General Staff. Interestingly, he was married to Dorothy Rose-Innes,
the daughter of Sir James Rose-Innes, a member of Rhodes' Association of
Helpers, as was their son Helmuth James von Moltke.
It was important for the power elite to drag the U.S. into the War, and so
Lord Esher (executive committee member of Rhodes' secret Society of the
Elect) wrote in his diary on August 3, 1917:
"Can there be any doubt that
the war has made for progress?"
He followed this on August 11 with,
"Mr.
Henry Morgenthau asked me to call on him.... He was one of the principal
supporters of President Wilson.... They are ready to sacrifice the lives of
American citizens.... Mr. Morgenthau realizes the importance... (of)
shedding American blood at the earliest possible moment."
Morgenthau would
be a founding member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which was
largely funded and staffed by J.P. Morgan and
John D. Rockefeller interests.
One of the key connections to these interests was William Boyce Thompson,
who in 1914 became the first full-term director of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York.
And the WASHINGTON POST (February 2, 1918) reported:
"William
B. Thompson, who was in Petrograd from July until November 1917, has made a
personal contribution of $1,000,000 to the Bolsheviki for the purpose of
spreading their doctrine in Germany and Austria."
While in Russia from July to November 1917, Thompson was head of the Red
Cross mission there.
The Red Cross was heavily dependent upon Wall Street
and especially J.P. Morgan interests for donations. Therefore, these
interests were able to use the Red Cross to further their goals.
Thompson's
assistant, Cornelius Kelleher, is quoted in George Kennan's RUSSIA LEAVES
THE WAR as stating:
"The Red Cross complexion of the mission was nothing but
a mask."
FDR adviser and Soviet agent in the 1940s Harry Hopkins was
assistant to the general manager of the Red Cross in Washington, D.C.
In
December 1917, Raymond Robins succeeded Thompson as head of the Red Cross
mission in Russia, and on December 26 Robins called Morgan senior partner
Henry Davison (chairman of the War Council of the American Red Cross, whose
son in 1920 would become a member of Skull & Bones) asking him to urge
President Wilson to continue intercourse with the Bolshevik Government.
Both Robins and his wife were associated with Bolshevik activities in the
U.S. Robins was a protégé of Colonel House and one of his heroes was Cecil
Rhodes.
According to Bruce Lockhart (sent to Russia by Lord Milner and Prime
Minister George) in BRITISH AGENT (1933),
"Robins was the only man whom
Lenin was always willing to see and who ever succeeded in imposing his own
personality on the unemotional Bolshevik leader."
Lenin capitulated to
Robins' ultimatum to remove Saalkind as Assistant Commissar for Foreign
Affairs.
Carroll Quigley in
Tragedy And
Hope
(1966) wrote:
"More than 50 years ago
(before 1916) the Morgan firm decided to infiltrate the Left-wing political
movements in the United States."
And the Morgan-controlled American
International Corporation (AIC) was probably the primary supporter of the
Bolsheviks.
On October 17, 1917, AIC director William Saunders (deputy
chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) wrote to President Wilson:
"I am in sympathy with the Soviet form of government as that best suited for
the Russian people."
Other AIC directors in 1917 were Pierre du Pont, J.
Peter Grace, Otto Kahn, Percy Rockefeller (Skull & Bones member), Frank Vanderlip (president of Rockefeller's National City Bank), and others.
Julius Hammer (chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corporation) and his son
Armand (who was a Soviet citizen) were also strong supporters of the
Soviets.
Colonel House in 1912 authored
Philip Dru - Administrator
promoting
"socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx." And one of his aides, Kenneth
Durant, became assistant secretary for the Soviet Bureau in the U.S. When
the premiers of France and Italy (Clemenceau and Orlando) later expressed
concern about the Bolsheviks and their westward expansion, Colonel House in
his diary wrote that he deliberately misled them into thinking there was
nothing that could be done about it.
President Wilson was simply a puppet of the power elite, manipulated by
their agent Colonel House. And on November 28, 1917, Wilson ordered there
should be no interference with the Bolsheviks' revolution.
Not long
thereafter, the U.S. legation in Bern, Switzerland cabled Washington,
"asking
why the president expresses support of Bolsheviki, in view of rapine, murder
and anarchy of these bands"
(U.S. State Department decimal file 861.00/1305,
March 15, 1918).
What is telling about American members of the power elite
supporting the Bolsheviks is the fact that even before the war ended, Soviet
troops were fighting and killing American soldiers in the Archangel region!
Robert Minor, whose cartoon I mentioned earlier, was a socialist who went to
Russia in March 1918 and then worked in the Commissariat for Foreign
Affairs. He even prepared propaganda against American soldiers and was
arrested, but Colonel House and President Wilson intervened on his behalf
and he was released without going to trial (probably because he was not
doing anything different than Thompson and Robins).
Colonel House was managing the power elite's plan to bring about "socialism
as dreamed of by Karl Marx," and the First World War was a necessary part of
that plan.
After the war, the CFR was founded largely by Colonel House's
group "the Inquiry," and in the CFR's FOREIGN AFFAIRS (June 1923) Colonel
House wrote:
"If war had not come in 1914 in fierce and exaggerated form,
the idea of an association of nations would probably have remained dormant,
for great reforms seldom materialize except during great upheavals."
The first association of nations the power elite planned, the League of
Nations, didn't materialize as the world government they desired, and
therefore a Second World War had to be arranged.
In case you don't believe
World War II was planned,
-
How else do you explain that power elite agent H.G.
Wells in 1933 in his THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME said in about six years the
war would begin over a German-Polish dispute, and Germany invaded Poland on
September 1, 1939 with Britain and France declaring war on Germany two days
later?
-
Moreover, how else do you explain power elite agent Sir Julian Huxley
on December 5, 1941, saying he hoped America and Japan would be at war "next
week," and the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred Sunday, December 7, 1941, the
first day of the next week?
The power elite knew that the second
"association of nations," the U.N., formed after World War II, would also
not be their desired world government, as H.G. Wells in
The Shape of Things to Come
said they would succeed on their third attempt resulting from a
conference in Basra, Iraq.
This is why the current war in Iraq was planned
by the power elite.
Cecil Rhodes' and the power elite's goal was and still is the establishment
of a World Socialist Government via linking regional economic arrangements,
and Lenin and Stalin were important parts of this. In Vienna in January
1913, Stalin had advocated national loyalties become subservient to regions.
And the year after Colonel House's FOREIGN AFFAIRS article appeared, Stalin
in April 1924 said that according to Leninism,
"a single world system of
economy constitutes the material basis for the victory of socialism."
It was also in this time (1920s) that Jean Monnet developed his plans for
the first of these economic regions, the European Union.
His lawyer was a
young John J. McCloy, the successor to Colonel House in managing the power
elite's plan.
In 1936, McCloy sat in Hitler's box at the Berlin Olympics,
and during the 1940s Secretary of War Henry Stimson (Skull & Bones member
who initiated George H.W. Bush into Skull & Bones) questioned
"whether
anyone in the Administration ever acted without having a word with McCloy."
From 1953 to 1970, McCloy was the chairman of the CFR, during which time he
swam with Soviet dictator Nikita Khrushchev in late July 1961 at the Black
Sea.
In the early 1950s, Frederick Schuman in THE COMMONWEALTH OF MEN: AN
INQUIRY INTO POWER POLITICS AND WORLD GOVERNMENT wrote that one way
permanent peace is attainable is,
"through the voluntary merging of
sovereignties in a global polity, with a World-State emerging out of
agreement."
McCloy was followed as CFR chairman by David Rockefeller from 1970 to 1985.
During that time, Bahai leader John Ferraby in ALL THINGS MADE NEW (1975)
wrote similarly to Schuman that,
"we have entered a new era, in which the
unification of mankind can be adequately organized only by a world state."
"World State" and "New World Order" were both terms used by
H.G. Wells to
refer to a world government.
This concept was adopted by a number of people,
and in JOURNEYS FOR A BETTER WORLD (1994), U.N. Secretariat official
Jean Richardot declared that,
"a prosperous united world representing a true New
World Order could only be attained step by step. While we are still far from
world government, we must first focus on essential issues that work in that
direction."
As I have written before, a single global currency is an important part of
this effort to achieve a world government.
In that regard Sarah Perry
(director of VISA's Strategic Investment Program) is quoted in THE SINGLE
GLOBAL CURRENCY (2006) as remarking in 2001:
"When VISA was founded 25 years
ago, the founders saw the world as needing a Single Global Currency for
exchange. Everything we've done from a global perspective has been about
trying to put one piece in place after another to fulfill that global
vision."
And how will the single global currency be brought about?
Nobel prize winner Robert Mundell (known as "the Father of the Euro") in a speech titled "A
Decade Later: Asia New Responsibilities in the International Monetary
System" delivered in Seoul, South Korea, May 2-3, 2007, revealed:
"International monetary reform usually becomes possible only in response to
a felt need and the threat of a global crisis. The global crisis would have
to involve the dollar," and a single global currency would be "a
contingency" to this global dollar crisis.
As you are aware, the dollar is
currently in crisis, plummeting in value.
David Rockefeller in his MEMOIRS (2002) admitted being part of a secret
cabal conspiring with others to bring about a world government.
This plan
was revealed 100 years ago by Robert Hugh Benson in LORD OF THE WORLD
(1907), in which he wrote that
"in 1917... communism really began.... The
new order began then."
Ten years before the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in
Russia, Benson foretold it.
Benson also wrote of a future European
Parliament, American Socialism, and "the final scheme of Western Free Trade"
occurring after 1989. He revealed that in the end, continent would unite
with continent, the appearance of peace would deceive many, and that "the
Humanity Religion was the only one."
This final replacement of God by man as the final moral authority will
characterize biblical end times.
As I mentioned in my December 31, 2007
NewsWithViews.com column "Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan," Ezekiel 38:5 indicates
that in the prophecy regarding Gog and Magog, Persians (Iranians) will come
against Israel.
According to Joseph Farah, recently on Israeli secular
television were in-depth reports on Gog and Magog describing the forces that
will be aligned against each other in Revelation 20. On one side will be
Israel, the U.S., Britain, France and Germany. On the other side will be
Iran, Russia, China, Syria and North Korea.
The Gog and Magog war is also
mentioned in the Koran in Sura 18:94 and 21:96, and the Iranian mullahs have
also recently been referring to this.
According to the Koran, the people
paid tribute to "The Conqueror" Dhu al Qarnayn, popularly understood to be
Alexander the Great (who was at the time considered Lord of the West, the
East, Persia, etc.), to erect barriers against the wild and lawless tribes
of Central Asia (Mongols from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, etc.).
However, in a
prognostication of the approaching "Judgment" of the world, the tribes break
through the barriers when the people degenerate morally, and the wild tribes
"swiftly swarm from every hill" against the formerly protected people
written about in the Koran.
Writing of Alexander the Great in this part of the world was Rhodes Trust
member Rudyard Kipling (who has swastikas on his early books) in THE MAN WHO
WOULD BE KING.
What is happening is the unfolding of Rhodes' plan for
world
government, which in turn will lead to the fulfillment of end times biblical
prophecy.
