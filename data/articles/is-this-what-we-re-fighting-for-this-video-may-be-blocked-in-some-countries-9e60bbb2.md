No, this is not a spoof or a put on.
This is what's actually going on in the field.
What kind of psychopathic criminals would send American troops to fight and

By the way, the US and UK news media rants on and on about the Taliban
supporting themselves with opium and heroin trading.
Since the invasion, Afghanistan now provides at least 80% of the world's
opium.

Note that the Taliban's take is around $200 million.
For people who can do math, that's less than 10% of the total score.
So who's getting the rest? Friends of Uncle Sam...
