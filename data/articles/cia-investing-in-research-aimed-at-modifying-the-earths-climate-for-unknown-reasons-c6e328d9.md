The US Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA)
is participating in funding a $630,000 study
on geoengineering for reasons which are not
entirely clear as of yet.
Geoengineering is the practice of using highly
experimental techniques to modify the climate of the Earth in various ways,
something which researchers like Dane Wiggington contend
is highly dangerous.
This particular 21-month-long study has a final
report due in the fall of 2014 and was commissioned in concert with the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS).
The costs will be split between the,
...according to
Mother Jones.
The NAS
website for the project specifically states that it,
has support from the National Academy of
Sciences and the U.S. Intelligence Community.
William Kearney, a spokesman for the NAS,
told Mother Jones that the above phrase refers to the CIA.
However, Edward Price, a CIA spokesman,
would not confirm the notoriously secretive agencys role in the project.
Yet Price did state that,
Its natural that on a subject like
climate change the Agency would
work with scientists to better understand the phenomenon and its
implications on national security.
The study will reportedly focus on techniques
like solar radiation management (SRM) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) while
commenting,
generally on the potential impacts of
deploying these technologies, including possible environmental,
economic, and national security concerns.
Interestingly, the study will only briefly
explore what
individuals like Wiggington would contend are major issues like,
potential societal and ethical
considerations related to geoengineering, according to the NAS.
Beyond the broad national security concerns
outlined by the NAS, the real motivations of the CIA in funding such a
project are unclear.
The Verge points out that the CIA has
reportedly played around with the environment in the past, even
allegedly sprayed a French village with LSD in the 1950s.
Separately,
the US military has attempted to modify local weather for combat
advantages and security, trying
to create rain clouds during the Vietnam
War that would turn a trail into mud, and experimenting with
silver iodides effects on hurricanes, The Verge
notes.
Mother Jones rightly notes,
The CIAs decision to fund scientific work
on geoengineering will no doubt excite conspiracy theorists.
Yet its not much of a theory to point out that
the military has modified the climate in the past, as they outline in their
article.
Why would one expect the CIA to have some kind
of altruistic end in mind when they spend
money on geoengineering research? To hold to such a contention, one
would be forced to simply abandon the entire stated mission of agencies like
the CIA as well as their history.
