I wish to thank my former fellow members of the staff of the Library
of Congress whose very kind assistance, cooperation and suggestions
made the early versions of this book possible.
I also wish to thank
the staffs of the Newberry Library, Chicago, the New York City
Public Library, the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia,
and the McCormick Library of Washington and Lee University,
Lexington, Virginia, for their invaluable assistance in the
completion of thirty years of further research for this definitive
work on the Federal Reserve System.
