The end game for
the Western elite is becoming clear now that food riots
have once again begun erupting around the world.
The elite has worked long
and hard to ensure they controlled a
monopoly on the worlds grain trade.
They have also forced most countries that submitted to IMF austerity
programs to give up food production in exchange for production of inedible
commodities that can be traded for dollars.
This has been part of their
long term plan to conquer humanity by controlling their minds, their
stomachs and their lives (through threat of violence).
However, as the recent overthrow of the family mafia government in Tunisia
shows, when ordinary people face starvation, they no longer behave like
sheep. The fact of the matter is that global hunger (there are over 1.1
billion people on the brink of starvation) is a logistics problem that could
be solved within 2 months.
This logistics operation will start soon after
the mass
arrests of the criminal element of the Western elite begins.
People
have been waiting for a long time but multiple, high-level sources say this
time the arrests really are imminent. It is merely a matter of a few
technical, legal operations that are now close to completion.
-
Already, as a preliminary, UN Secretary General
Ban Ki Moon has been ordered
to resign
-
Also Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has had his
immunity from prosecution removed
-
There have also been arrests of Chinese
who were compromised by bribes from
the Bush clan
This is just a mere and
slight foretaste of what is to come.
One sign of the high level panic is a recently taped conversation between
Fiat heir Giovanni Agnelli, head of financial services at Davos Giancarlo
Bruno and self declared Satanist Prince
Leo Zagami.
At the recorded meeting, Agnelli told Bruno and Zagami that they had to sign their own death
warrants. After that, according to senior intelligence agency sources, Agnelli ordered Zagami to leave the room. At that point he told Bruno that
Zagami was such a blabbermouth that he threatened the monarchy and that he
had to go.
Correction
Above, we incorrectly reported that Giovanni Agnelli was tape recorded having a conversation with Giancarlo Bruno and Leo
Zagami. As many readers pointed out Giovanni Agnelli died several years ago.
We asked our CIA source which Agnelli he was referring to and he said,
All I
heard is that it was one of the Agnelli brothers.
We apologize for the
mistake. It occurred because we used Google to find the first name of the
most famous member of the Angelli family and assumed it was him.
In any case, a senior source in the
Knights of Malta has independently
confirmed the conversation was recorded and says the investigation and
observation of the Italians and the Davos gang has now gone above Giancarlo
Bruno.
The monarchy refers to
the heir of Victor Emmanuel III who
appears to have wanted to create a global Roman empire.
In other words, a
group of inbred Italian families, who have married between cousins since the
time of Caesar, have been plotting global conquest for 2000 years. Just as
they thought they were on the verge of accomplishing their goals with the
massacre of 4 billion innocents, they now find themselves in deep danger for
their very lives.
The fact of the matter is that a critical mass within,
...and police forces around the
world, have been investigating this elite group for a long time and are now
poised to start a major series of arrests prior to the announcement of the
new financial system.
The various
royal families that have lead major clans around the world, for
their part, are aware of the crisis and have been cooperating with the new
system in order to make sure the world does not descend into chaos and
anarchy.
Although secrecy surrounding the emergency meeting of royal
families from around the world that took place around new years in Vienna,
Austria, a few details have leaked.
Our sources tell us that strategic marriages between the British, Dutch and
other European families are being considered with members of Arabian,
Chinese and other royal families.
Since some of these families have secretly
controlled large sections of monotheistic
religions, the long term
implications of such inter-marriage would be truly historical, possibly
leading to an integration between christianity, islam and confucianism.
The anti-royalist coalition, for its part, is insisting on the establishment
of meritocratic organizations to manage the planet earth.
One such
organization would be a world economic planning organization. This
organization would systematically gather public opinion from around the
world about humanities dreams of the future. It would then gather the
worlds experts to find the most practical way of making these dreams come
true.
Anybody would be able to apply to join this organization and
complete
freedom of information would be implemented to ensure it does not become
corrupt. This organization would in no way impinge on either individual or
national sovereignty.
The anti-royalist coalition will accept the need of family elders
represented by the royal families to act as guardians against anarchy but
will never accept absolute monarchist rule by primogeniture.
The
White Dragon Society, for its part, will soon raise itself from
semi-dormant to semi-active mode.
