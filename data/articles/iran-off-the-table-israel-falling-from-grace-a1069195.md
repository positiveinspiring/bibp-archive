Over the weekend four very strange events happened. First, Israeli jets were
scrambled to intercept a private plane Tony Blair was on, and
threatened to shoot it down! It is reported that they were under the
impression that Blair was a terrorist coming to attack their country. Right
thought, wrong context, guys.
Reportedly, they
threatened to shoot the plane down when
they tried to talk to Blairs people, and got no response.
What?!
This isnt Joe Smith from some small town
in Indiana, this is Tony Blair, 1000 proof
Illuminati. Are we supposed to
believe that he just waltzes from country to country without calling first?
I feel like Im watching some show like 24, which treats me like Im a total
idiot or something.
And here comes the best part:
According to the report in the Times,
the former prime minister was unaware of the situation.
They were unaware of it while they were
on the plane, Ruti Winterstein, a spokeswoman for Mr Blairs office
in Israel, told the paper. They didnt hear about it until
afterwards, from the media.
I can understand that maybe, in the heat of the
moment, the crew might have been rushing about to cover their butts, but
being moments from possible death and he has to wait to know until the media
tells him what happened? Thats not the sort of situation anyone would
overlook or forget.
Hmm
sounds like something might be brewing
behind the scenes here.
The second thing is Jimmy Carter coming out at
a press conference in Wales saying that
Israel had a stockpile of at least 150 nukes. Thats been known for like 25
years now after Mordechai Vannu brought that out to the public in the
80s. He paid the price for that. Kidnapped by the Mossad, taken back to
Israel, put away for 20 years in prison (much of it in solitary), and being
arrested many times after that even when he was released.
A real eye-catcher though was what he said about
the treatment of Palestinians in Israel.
One of the greatest human rights crimes on
earth is the starvation and imprisonment of 1.6m Palestinians, he said.
The former US president cited statistics which
he said showed the nutritional intake of some Palestinian children was below
that of children in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as saying the European
position on Israel could be best described as supine.
All true. And they love to
sonic boom the Palestinian kids on purpose
while theyre going to school in the morning. To punish them for the
crimes of someone who they most likely didnt know who got in a shootout
and killed one or two soldiers. Cold thugs.
A former military intelligence chief got mad at
Carter for throwing the light on their guns, calling him irresponsible and
adding:
The problem is that there are those who can
use these statements when it comes to discussing the international
effort to prevent Iran getting nuclear weapons, he said.
Damn right. If they have a conscience that is.
Poor baby mad. Poor baby dont get to kill millions of Innocent people. Baby
cry! And they have dragged totally brainwashed, weak minded fools worldwide
into their orbit, mimicking their psychosis and getting power trips thinking
they are right there with the Israelis, showing the scum Palestinians whos
boss.
Heres
an example right here. Too outrageous for
words.
You have to wonder though what is up here with Carter. This guy is a
lifelong, one world government pushing insider to the hilt. He was a
founding member of the Trilateral Commission with
David Rockefeller (who called Maos
killing of 60 million Chinese a successful social experiment) and
Zbigniew Brzezinski.
Also is a member of the
Council on Foreign Relations whose real goal, unknown to most the
members is the
dissolution of Americas borders to create
a North American Union to set the stage for the Earth Union. When someone
like him, who as President gave
the slave labor
utilizing, mass murdering Chinese full diplomatic and trade
relations starts talking about human rights, it should make one quite
suspicious.
Third on the list is the story out there of Israels Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert taking illegal payments of cash
totaling $150,000.
This is a fast growing story out there these
past few days which is quite surprising considering when
the Israeli President raped several women,
it barely got any attention in the media.
And finally, Zbigniew Brzezinski (above
image), the daywalker himself, coming out and
saying some unique things (for someone of
his position) about Israel and AIPAC, the Israel lobby tentacle in the US.
Mr Brzezinski said:
Its not unique to the Jewish community
but there is a McCarthyite tendency among some people in the Jewish
community, referring to the Republican senator who led the
anti-Communist witch hunt in the 1950s.
They operate not by arguing but by slandering, vilifying, demonizing.
They very promptly wheel out anti-Semitism. There is an element of
paranoia in this inclination to view any serious attempt at a
compromised peace as somehow directed against Israel.
This one is ruthless to the core.
Co-founder of the
Trilateral Commission, friend of Henry Kissinger, and was
key in goading the Soviets into invading Afghanistan through US funding of
the mujahedeen fighters.
A fact which he bragged about in a 98 interview
with the French paper Le Nouvel Observateur (below insert).
When asked if there were any regrets about this,
he said:
Regret what? That secret operation was an
excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the
Afghan trap and you want me to regret it?
This occupation from 1979-89 left more than a
million Afghans dead, left land mines which kill dozen a month, and weakened
the country so no one could effectively resist either the Taliban or the
coalition forces after them. Just look at this ghoul.
This thing will most likely be the next national
security advisor to President Obama of the USA.
He also lays out a plan for Palestine and Israel.
In Mr Brzezinskis view, whoever is the next US leader must persuasively
propose the following dramatic steps to peace:
-
Palestinians give up the right of return
from Jordan
-
demilitarize of the Palestinian state
-
Israel share Jerusalem
-
Israel return to its pre-1967 war
borders with equitable adjustments
Equitable for who, though?
Well, we know that Ziggy is backing Obama.
Obama would actually be perfect for this because of his skin color, which
actually might help him be a sort of middle man between the predominantly
European Israeli population and the darker skinned Palestinian Arabs.
And he has the Arab middle name which would
appeal to the Arab Palestinian population. He also does not have the history
of a McCain or Clinton, who are seen as too Israel oriented. All he
would really have to do is to lay in one of those magic holy speeches of
his, and theyd swing the votes his way.
The West is already against an armed Iran conflict, having learned lessons
from Iraq and Afghanistan.
These four unprecedented things here show that
the bloodthirsty Israeli government, (not the people) behind the scenes, are
being given a serious message that they arent as powerful as they think
they are, and to curb their fangs on Iran and perhaps, even Palestine. I
wouldnt be surprised to see some new stories come out about
Israel
funding Hamas or some other groundbreaking thing of that nature.
It seems there is a feud going on between the Israel controlling
Rothschilds and the British-USA
controlling Windsors. Brzezinski seems to want to do things by guile,
bloodlessly, while the other faction seems to want to carry things out
brutally and with maximum bloodshed.
Which side will win?
Well, its like Alien vs. Predator,
whoever we let win, we lose.
