A veritable re-engineering of the entire planet
has been taking place in front of our eyes for many decades now. However,
since it is gradual, most people do not notice or understand what is
happening.
Just like the proverbial frog that if thrown into boiling water painfully
jumps out and survives, but will be cooked and die if thrown into lukewarm
water where the heat rises one degree every 5 minutes
What goes under the name of New World Order, Globalization or (my
favorite) World Government describes the long-term objectives of a highly
powerful Global Power Elite embedded inside every country, notably the US
and Europe, that owns, operates and channels every countrys resources,
-
oil
-
finance
-
economic strength
-
military prowess
-
natural resources,
... from inside to promote their supranational
agenda.
This highly complex, holistic and extensively planned process helps explain
much (if not all) of the on-going violence, chaos and injustice we see in
the realms of finance, politics and the economy. But good strategic planning
also requires experimentation, trial and error, scenario building and war
games.
My native country, Argentina (and Latin America as a whole), have been
repeatedly used for such experimentation, as happened here ten years ago
when
the international banking cartel aligned to the IMF/World Bank, US
Treasury Department, rating agencies and the qualified mainstream media,
worked together to collapse Argentinas financial and monetary system, but
at the same time managed to save all their banks that operated in the
country.
Argentines saw their money locked up in the banks, their Dollar deposits
were arbitrarily changed into local devalued pesos at fraudulent rates of
exchange as local Caretaker Governments (to this very day) take measures
always aligned to local and international banker interests.
The results for Argentina?
-
GDP fell by 40% in 2002
-
50% of our population fell below the
poverty line (most never made it back up again)
-
violence and death on our streets
-
foreclosures
-
bankruptcies
-
full-fledged social war (that stopped
just short of civil war),
...and yet
. not one single bank folded!
If we fast-forward to,
-
Greece
-
Ireland
-
Italy
-
Spain
-
the US
-
UK
-
Portugal
-
Iceland,
...today, we see the same scene over and over
again.
Clearly, not mistakes made by specific
governments, but a veritable model designed to control whole nations
imposing unnecessary and fraudulent public debts.
One of the key lessons they learned in Argentina was how to control We the
People through PsyWar (Psychological Warfare) exerted by the controlled
media so that the population ends up accepting all the hardship, whilst the
banker and government perpetrators get to keep all the money and stay in
power.
I wonder whether the European Union might not be a similar experiment but on
a much vaster and grander scale? An experiment on how to bring very
different countries with different languages, legal systems, cultures,
histories of war and hatred amongst them, all under a straight-jacket of
bureaucratic union that increasingly sweeps away national sovereignties?
A sort of How To on promoting voluntary
submission by the EUs 27 member states to accept one legal bureaucracy, one
parliament, one unelected president, one military force, one flag, and one
currency
-
What lessons are Globalists learning
from the troubles of the EU?
-
Are todays growing Euro-woes a
reflection of the fact that, after more than half a century of
Euro-building we now see the controlled demolition of the EU in
order to (re)build it into something new?
-
Perhaps, moulding it into something
closer to their hearts desire, as the old 19th Century
British Fabian Society urging gradual socialist world government
once envisioned?
-
Is the EU an intermediate stage on the
Hard
Road to World Order suggested by Council on Foreign
Relations member Richard Gardner in a seminal April 1974 article in
Foreign Affairs?
-
A stage in which legal, political,
trade, financial, social, cultural, media, monetary, military and so
many, many other complexities have been iron-out, re-designed and
re-tooled to serve a greater purpose?
-
Will we soon see the break-up of the
Euro, not as an unfortunate accident but as a planned mega-process
which (together with the hyper-inflated US Dollar) will be allowed
to tailspin into a controlled collapse only to be replaced by a new
global currency issued and managed by Global Power Elite private
interests from a coming world central bank of some sort?
-
Does the EU have an Expiry Date?
The
Vatican, always well informed, seems to think so as we see
from their recent call for revamped global institutions; a sure sign that
the old men who walk the Vatican Corridors are again reserving their place
under the coming sun
The controlled collapse of the Euro (through its break-up) and of the
US Dollar (through inflation) coupled with a suitably engineered version of
the Arab Spring for Europe, the US and others, that further erodes
national sovereignties on a planetary scale, fuelled by controlled
sequential wars and supported by increasing PsyWar emanating from the
Western media monopolies
All just one big mistake or merely different views of the same
planetary Leviathan bent on imposing
World Government on us all?
