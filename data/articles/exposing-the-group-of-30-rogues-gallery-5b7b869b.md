# Exposing The Group of 30 - Rogues Gallery

The long period of extremely easy
monetary conditions has not generated
inflationary pressures in the advanced
market economies (AMEs), as many
initially feared.
However, it might well
have contributed to further
misallocations of real resources in the
economy, to reducing potential output,
and to unsustainable increases in asset
prices.
The
emerging market economies
(EMEs) have imported similar undesirable
forces, in part due to their own efforts
to hold down exchange rates subject to
the influence of large-scale capital
inflows.
There seems to be widespread
agreement that central banks must exit
from these abnormal policies at some
point.
However, uncertainty about both
the modalities and implications of such
an exit implies a bias toward this
happening too late rather than too soon.
Evaluation of a number of possible
scenarios reveals a growing and
worrisome set of exposures to future
economic instability despite seven years
of extraordinarily easy monetary
conditions.
Let's attempt to break down the above
pile of word goo and put it language anyone
can understand.
The long period of extremely easy
monetary conditions has not generated
inflationary pressures in the advanced
market economies (AMEs), as many initially
feared.
Explain to me why housing prices have
gone up as much as they have, what about
food, education, health care and utilities?
This is the first lie in the first statement
of this chapter.
If inflation is measured by
the number of MB a computer now contains
versus the same computer last year, then no,
inflation is not a real problem. However,
you can not eat an iPad, nor is an iPad
necessary to function or sustain life.
However, it might well have
contributed to further misallocations of
real resources in the economy, to reducing
potential output, and to unsustainable
increases in asset prices.
As Richard Fisher stated several months
ago, the Federal Reserve
front loaded a wealth effect that now has to
go through a digestive period.
As the
Federal Reserve has continued to pump up the
S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average
stock markets this has created an illusion
that covers up the fact the U.S. economy has
never recovered from the 2006-2008 financial
crisis the banks caused in the first place.
To say these stock markets can not sustain
this illusion is an understatement. The
crash that will occur will make the previous
crash look like child's play.
There seems to be widespread
agreement that central banks must exit from
these abnormal policies at some point.
Once the current policies of
Quantitative
Easing (QE) and
Zero Interest Rate Policy
(ZIRP) are discontinued our economy will
come to a grinding halt. The illusion will
be fully exposed. You now know who is to
blame for this coming nightmare.
However, uncertainty about both the
modalities and implications of such an exit
implies a bias toward this happening too
late rather than too soon.
We are well past the time when the damage
could be contained or managed. The time to
have stopped this madness
was in 2008 when
the too big to jail banks were allowed to
swindle the American people out of trillions
of dollars of wealth. That wealth will never
be returned to the American people.
How will
the G30 be able to morph this illusion into
the next leg of theft without blowing the
system apart?
Evaluation of a number of possible
scenarios reveals a growing and worrisome
set of exposures to future economic
instability despite seven years of
extraordinarily easy monetary conditions.
Even with seven years of ongoing, in
broad daylight, theft it is not enough and
the G30 must find a way to sustain the theft
or find the next economy to pillage.
As soon
as these unrealistic economic experiments
come to an end there are only two outcomes
that I can see - the system simply implodes
or the Group of 30 find a way to
implement the next leg of theft that will be
sold the world as a saving grace to protect
them from the evils of "terrorism" or some
other set of lies, deceit and propaganda.
This is just the Synopsis of this one
chapter! As you can see each word is very
important and usually runs contrary to the
reality of what we face here in everyday
life.
For those paying attention this may
help with a deeper understanding of what is
actually happening in the background. For
those that are new, welcome, and what you
have just learned can not be unlearned.
I have reached the conclusion the G30 may
be the most evil group of people on the
planet. The purpose of this group is to
carry forward Rothschild's original thought
about controlling a nations currency/money
supply.
Here is what
Mayer Rothschild had to
say about the best way to
steal a nations wealth:
"Let me issue and control a nation's
money and I care not who writes the laws."
Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812)
founder of the
House of Rothschild.
The G30 is charged with carrying on the
tradition.
Here are the faces that make up the
current Group of 30 (currently 32 members):
