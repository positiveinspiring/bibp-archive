It must be pretty clear now - even to the
densest of individuals - that Bush and his fellow weasels
deliberately lied the US into the Iraq war.
So how does the US news media respond to a former press secretaries account
of this reality? They question his loyalty, his accuracy, his motivations.
And it's largely working....
These questions have framed the discussion of the McClellan book.
Not the fact that we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that Bush and
Rove and Rice and Cheney lied, betrayed the
country and did it for personal gain.
-
How many Iraqi civilians dead now?
-
How many US servicemen and women dead or
injured gravely?
-
How many innocent lives destroyed?
And the f%$%ing brain dead news media is talking
about whether or not McClellan was good team player?
