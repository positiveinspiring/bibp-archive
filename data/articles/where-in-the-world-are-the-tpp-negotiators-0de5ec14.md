News broke late last week in a few
subscription-only, on-line, trade journals that while the next full
round of negotiations of the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) are slated
to take place in Malaysia in mid-July,
the negotiating group on rules of origin
will meet June 23-29 in San Francisco, according to Peruvian government
resolutions published on June 16 and 17 in the countrys official
newspaper.
Often occurring under the radar, intersessionals,
meetings that take place between official TPP negotiations, are happening in
advance of the session in Malaysia to try to keep the free trade talks on
track for conclusion this fall.
Last month, negotiators of the ever
controversial
investment chapter met in Vancouver and were challenged with a teach-in
on TPP, a night-time light
projection of anti-TPP messages and a protest organized by the
TPPxBorder Network.

A meeting in San Francisco on Rules of Origin?
As Arthur Stamoulis from the
Citizens Trade
Campaign explains,
One
of the least talked about chapters of the TPP is something called Rules
of Origin.
Rules
of Origin are the standards that must be met in order for a product to
be labeled Made in the USA, Made in Brunei, Made in Vietnam or
wherever in order to qualify for the provisions set by the overall TPP
Agreement.
There
are different ways of evaluating a products origin, but one common way
is by looking at the value of the parts that make up a finished product
thats to be exported.
So, for example, if the Rule of Origin on cars is
set at 50% - at least half of the parts in a finished automobile need to
come from Japan in order to be labeled Made in Japan under the pact.
If the
Rule of Origin is only set at 30%, up to 70% of the parts can come from
elsewhere and the car can still be labeled Japanese.
We thought that the Rules of Origin negotiators
would like to hear from
former sweatshop worker Chie Abad, who once suffered under an
earlier version of these Rules of Origin in the U.S. protectorate, Siapan.
Working for GAP, and other U.S. retailers
through the SAKO garment factory, she sewed Made in the USA labels into
clothing, yet enjoyed none of the worker protections which U.S. workers do.
In fact, she was fired for attempting to organize a union.
Again, Arthur explains how the TPP takes
advantage of the experience Chie had, and make it
worse,
Brand-name
product companies, as well as retailers like Walmart and Target, want
low Rules of Origin that enable them to source parts from wherever in
the world they can get them for the cheapest price and then assemble
them in low-wage TPP countries and still qualify for the zeroed-out
tariff rates and quotas the TPP will provide.
Often this
means sourcing production wherever labor is the most exploited and
environmental regulations the weakest.
Because the government of Vietnam, which
promotes its country as a low-cost labor alternative to China, is siding
with the major transnationals in pushing for much lower Rules of Origin than
most other countries within the TPP negotiations, wed heard that the Rules
of Origin negotiations are very heated.
Despite photos of friendly handshakes after the
recent full round in Lima, Peru, countries are far from reaching
agreement, and continued disagreement over the chapter possesses
the potential to sink the entire pact.
We tried for days to contact the Rules of Origin
negotiators, but with no luck.
We called the top hotels in the city and found
that not only did most people not know where the negotiatiors were meeting,
they also didnt know what the TPP is, so we decided to take to the streets
and look ourselves (and do some public education at the same time!).
Heres what happened:
The TPP - Where Are the Negotiators?
TAKE ACTION!
