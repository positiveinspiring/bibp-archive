Them Here

Freedom of information is so important
these days.
As people battle to determine and
uncover the truth, they are met with lies, manipulation, and half
truths from media, government, and other large official bodies.
Thankfully, our collective demand for
truth has become so fierce that 'the few' are finding it
increasingly difficult to hide it from us.
In yet another big leak,
Wikileaks has published a gold mine archive of 1258 emails from
Hillary Clinton's private server. All of these emails pertain to the
Iraq war. This presents an amazing opportunity for humanity that is
discussed near the end of this article.
This leak was promised by WikiLeaks
founder Julian Assange when he revealed he had collected
sufficient evidence for
the FBI to indict Clinton.
"We could proceed to an indictment,
but if
Loretta Lynch is the head of the [Department of Justice]
in the United States, she's not going to indict Hillary
Clinton," he said.
Translation:
if the elite protect their own, she
will walk, and maybe even still become president, but there is
enough evidence here to indict her.

The Full List
Via this direct link to Wikileaks, you
can view the entire collection of emails regarding the Iraq War,
gathered from Clinton's private server.
This comes ahead of the
Chilcot Report, a British public inquiry into the nation's role
in the disastrous war launched in 2003, which critics say caused the
destabilization of the Middle East.
This recent collection of emails is part
of a larger bundle released by the State Department in February
under the
Freedom of Information Act.
Clinton's Indictment
Clinton has been facing the threat of
FBI indictment for quite some time over her use of a private email
server during her time as Secretary of State from 2009-2013.
Her actions put state secrets at risk
and also raised questions about Hillary's desire to keep secrets
from prying government and public eyes, with the Clinton Foundation
repeatedly accused of catering to special interests, including
foreign interests.
Many believe she has received millions
in campaign contributions from the Saudi monarchy.
Clinton is the Democratic Party's
frontrunner and presumed nominee for the presidency. But those in
her campaign see this FBI investigation as a looming storm cloud
over Clinton's head that could end her bid for the top role.
Republican rival Donald Trump has
repeatedly threatened to put her in prison over the scandal,
claiming,
"everyone knows she's guilty."
While he may be right, the fact remains
that many in power would be turning their backs on a powerful
ally by going through with the move.
Interesting
Opportunity Here
We have a unique situation.
It's been made publicly clear with
substantial evidence that Hillary has acted illegally and should be
indicted and likely go to prison given the rules set forth by
government.
-
If this does happen, we're witnessing quite a shift in
the way our world is run, the loss of power of the cabal and perhaps
even more power returning to the people.
-
If she does not go to prison, and
somehow becomes president, not only will be know criminals run some
countries but it will become even more clear to the public that
there is something behind the scenes going on that is protecting a
certain few.
This will lead to even greater understandings of the
manipulation that is going on in our world.
With some final thoughts here, I'd like
to point out that in the giant network I have online and of all the
people I've spoken to over the past few months, not a single person
said they support or would vote for Hillary Clinton.
So where are her voters and where is her
popularity? I'm not saying my network is an entire snapshot, but
simply that I can't seem to figure out who actually supports this
woman for presidency.
Let's not forget, the only reason she is
the candidate instead of Bernie Sanders is because of Superdelegates.
The public wanted Bernie.
So,
Wikileaks has been responsible for a
number of
important revelations over the past several years.
Thank you whistleblowers! Every one of
you is helping to put an end to the cabal and their secrets...
