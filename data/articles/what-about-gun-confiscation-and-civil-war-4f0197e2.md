What about Gun Confiscation
and
Civil
war?
This Awareness indicates that this
is a priority before a New World Government could be established. This Awareness
indicates that it does not appear that it will be an easy event or easy goal
for the globalists to conclude. It appears that there will be great resistance
to having the guns removed from the citizens, and they will not likely attempt
any action until the guns are removed. This Awareness indicates that the possibility
exists that if there is not a consensus among or a majority among the masses
in favor of gun controls, and if this does not catch on among the masses,
then the indication would suggest the people have no intention of giving up
their guns, and it may be sufficient to keep the globalists from enacting
their scenario of bringing in UN troops to confiscate guns from people's homes.
Gun Control
will come in increments
This Awareness indicates that instead,
the approach would be to disarm them in small increments, taking away certain
rights, requiring registration of guns and so forth, beginning with what is
obvious: the disarming of children, which is obviously a necessity, and moving
from there to the next step, registering guns and investigating gun buyers
before selling a gun to them, et. cetera. By creating many little laws regarding
the ownership of guns, the hope is that there can be a gradual changing in
the consciousness in regard to licensing and regulating gun ownership, and
if entities can be licensed, then everyone who owns a gun is known in terms
of location and the ownership of the gun, which makes it easier for ever future
government to locate those people having guns,.
There can also be taxation placed
on guns at some future date, and there can also be the action of government
control over the bullets, and in so controlling the bullets and the making
of the shells for these guns, the government can make the guns useless, or
near useless. This Awareness indicates that there are many ways whereby the
government may attempt through one increment after another to disarm the people,
even if they cannot get them to give up their ownership of their hand-gun.
Government
and criminals may combine
If the criminals and the government
forces should join together to enslave the people, there is little that can
be done by the people to avoid this. In many people's minds the criminal organizations
may be seen not so much as independent of government control, but as part
of a greater conspiracy using the criminal organizations by the government.
For example, down through history, there were many governments who used those
forces from that group know as assassins. This Awareness indicates that the
same has been suggested in regard to the government use of the Mafia, whereby
if a legitimate government agency was not effective in dealing with a particular
individual or group, the government might enlist the Mafia to take part in
the assassination.
How Gestapo
tactics by government can snowball
This Awareness indicates that with
this recognition, there are as many people who consider it their patriotic
duty to keep the right to bear arms
This Awareness indicates if all entities
were without any protection of arms and it were known all over the United
States that only government officials had the right to bear arms, do you not
think that these Gestapo tactics would increase ten-fold, and become much
more belligerent and threatening in their expression? This Awareness indicates
that as long a s people have some protection, protection against their own
elected officials, against their own bureaucratic appointees, and the organizations
that have been created from the executive branches of various administrations
down through the years of lobbyists from special interest groups, as long
as these entities do not feel they have proper justice in this country and
these lobbyists and special interest groups can buy off government to create
agencies that protect their special interests, such as the FDA or the IRS
or other groups such as the firearms and alcohol and housing authorities or
whatever, do you not think that before long you might also have postal inspectors
raiding your home because of some product you are mailing or sending through
the mail or because of some information you have been sending or receiving
through the mail?
Do you not think it might spread
to other government bureaucratic agencies so that perhaps the welfare mother
will be invaded by welfare agents who come to check to find out what she eats,
or what she does with her money? This Awareness indicates if entities are
totally helpless, those in power tend to bully, even if they are supposed
to be the servants of the people.
This Awareness indicates that your
choice of medical care may some day be classed as criminal, if you have no
power left, and if these entities have strengthened their power by your total
disarmament as a citizenry. This awareness indicates that therefore, the struggle
for total domination of the people by those in position of bureaucratic status
can become either a curse upon the people, or the people can remind the bureaucrats
where they are, and who they serve.
This Awareness indicates that if
the power base is given to the bureaucrats, then the people are really nothing
more than victims dependent on the good will and altruism of those who carry
the guns. This Awareness indicates that there will be a time some day in
the future wherein guns can be eliminated from consciousness, but it is
not appropriate to eliminate these tools of protection while there are still
others out there who are willing to use these tools as weapons of control.
The lone
Berserk gunman scenarios will these increase or decrease?
This Awareness indicates that it
is being used to give the impression that the control of guns will stop the
senseless violence. This Awareness indicates that the same could be said for
automobiles. Entities could also say that if they were seeking to get rid
of automobiles, for example, they could point to the accidents that occur
and these could be broadcast on television, to show that even though entities
have a right to automobiles, that they should have that right curtailed, that
they should lose all rights to drive automobiles.
This Awareness indicates that they
could show the dangers and the continued accidents that are occurring and
make a good argument that entities should have their automobiles taken from
them. This Awareness indicates that many entities driving automobiles would
feel very paranoid about these arguments and would cling tighter to their
automobiles, and they might be made to feel somewhat guilty for having an
automobile when other people are giving up their automobiles, and in the case
wherein money was offered by the state for entities to bring in their automobiles,
there might be be some who will bring in their old automobile that does not
run well anyway, in order to give themselves the feeling that they are complying
with the wishes of the government and of the majority of their peers who are
opposed to automobiles, but they may keep or turn around and take the money
to buy another automobile.
This is what has happened in some
of the areas wherein guns were taken, wherein entities were paid to bring
in their guns, wherein the state or the police would buy guns from the citizenry.
They would receive old guns that were almost worthless or ineffective and
pay for those guns and the people would take the money and go out and buy
a better gun. This Awareness indicates that the people who bear guns and know
that they have the intelligence to use them properly, are not likely to give
up their guns any more than they would give up their automobiles, and the
government has already begun to realize this.
In some areas where there were laws
passed that entities could not have guns, instead of entities turning in their
guns, they went out and bought more, and there were more guns being sold in
that general area than had been sold before. This Awareness indicates that
there is something in this that makes people realize the reason for the article
2 in the Constitution, the Right to Bear Arms. This Awareness indicates that
more and more, as these efforts are made to disarm the people, the people
will begin to appreciate the Constitution that gives them the rights and they
will begin to assert themselves in promoting the Constitution and the efforts
to take away the Constitution and the right to bear arms is likely to backfire
on the globalists so that rather than having One World Government, they will
themselves be targeted for being traitors to the nation and may be called
criminals for treasons.
This Awareness indicates there would
be a great excitement among most entities if indeed they could trust a One
World Government if that government had the kind of guarantees offered in
the U.S. Constitution for all of the citizens of the world. Most entities
would be highly excited and glad to support such a government, but who in
their right mind, would support a world government that wants to destroy the
U.S. Constitution, and offers no clear discussion of what the NWO will be,
other than control by the UN and its troops over all countries and people
who do not comply with the NWO and its agenda?
This Awareness indicates that who
needs as vague undefined leader or structure that does not define what it
offers, when you already have something that defines the kind of freedom,
the kind of protection that entities in other countries give their lives for,
which entities in the past have given their lives to promote and create?
This Awareness indicates that most
entities appreciate the freedoms of your country guaranteed by your Constitution.
They would like in fact, to have even more guarantees and freedoms made available.
This Awareness indicates it does not appear likely that even with the control
of the press and the media that the globalists will indeed sustain and survive
in their efforts to destroy the U.S. Constitution and enslave the masses under
the NWO, although it is quite possible that many entities will be destroyed
in their efforts to do so.
(Freedom will not be taken easily from citizens)
A world
revolution will throw of the yoke
This Awareness indicates that as
this comes closer, entities will begin to react, with greater suspicion, with
more questions and eventually a great revolution will occur throughout the
world to throw off those who would impose
the NWO. This Awareness indicates
that it may need to come very close, and its teeth may need to hurt before
entities react sufficiently, but in the end, the NWO will have a very short
life, perhaps not even completely being established before it is thrown off.
This Awareness indicates that the process, however, can be painful for all
of humanity. This Awareness indicates there are many entities in the police
and military forces throughout the world who will begin to see what this NWO
really is and will turn their energies into resisting and stopping the action
rather than assisting in the oppression of the masses.
Centuries-Old
Plans Are now Culminating Today
This Awareness indicates It cannot
guarantee that the masses will have smooth sailing in the coming years, that
there will not be suffering, for you are in the midst of a culmination of
a plan that has been brewing for many decades, even centuries, wherein these
entities have sought to create a One World Government for several centuries
and have accumulated many tools and techniques and methods for accomplishing
that purpose and wherein they have garnered many individuals under their control
in particular positions wherein they control the media, much of the political
arena, the money system, medical system and other bureaucratic agencies and
organizations where they have fingers extending into the religions of the
world, to control these areas.
It is indeed likened unto a giant
octopus with tentacles reaching into all areas of one's life, and these entities
are arrogant and believe they have total control, yet in the end, there is
something in the souls of entities that remains free to some extent, even
in the most totalitarian case or situation.
