"Why should I believe you?"
John L. Young asks that question a lot. When he poses it to me, leveling his
intense, glassy blue eyes at mine across a barroom table on a muggy evening
in late May, it is less a direct attack on my credibility than a cruel
epistemological riddle.
Over the previous week, I had exchanged e-mails and
spoken on the telephone with Young, a 71-year-old architect, spy buff, and
proprietor of a strange and engrossing website called
Cryptome, to set up an
interview.
In doing so, I supplied him with certain data: my name [John
Cook], occupation [reporter], employer [Radar magazine], location [216 E.
45th St.], e-mail address [redacted], telephone number [redacted]. Young
craves data. He covets it, collects it, triangulates it, and uploads it to Cryptome
- an online repository of forbidden information - where it collides
with more data, gig after gig sloshing around in chaotic digital clouds.
There are high-resolution satellite photos of
President Bush's Crawford
ranch, technical documents detailing how the National Security Agency
spies
on computer traffic, even the home addresses and telephone numbers of
government officials, including former Director of National Intelligence
John Negroponte.
But Young knows that raw data is suspect.
Before it is loosed on the
Internet, scrubbed, cross-referenced, and interrogated by the hive mind for
inconsistencies and cracks, it can be used to deceive. People lie.
Misinformation is everywhere. People will use you; they will try to get you
to believe things that aren't true in order to advance their own agendas.
It
is, as Young likes to say, "standard tradecraft."
I could hand him a
business card, show him a magazine, look him firmly and earnestly in the
eye, and swear up and down that I am who I say I am.
"But," he'll reply with
a caustic smile, "that's how liars talk."
There is no way out of this for John Young. He has a very good reason to
suspect me, but he has good reasons to suspect everyone. Inquisitive
reporters could have ulterior motives. Even the most casual of social
interactions could be an attempt to shake him down for information.
Every
smiling stranger could be a Trojan horse; each friendly e-mail the beginning
of a sting. It must be exhausting.
Cryptome is, in the words of washingtonpost.com columnist and NBC News
military analyst William Arkin, "the Google of national security." It is a
meticulously maintained online compendium of information - some previously
available to the public, some not - devoted to plumbing and exposing the
secrets of the intelligence world. With a clean, crisp design, it presents,
in no discernible order, simple red links to documents and text files
against a white background.
Much of the material Young collects is
stultifyingly dull - "RFC Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code" will take
the reader to an announcement in the Federal Register concerning a
"mechanism for message authentication using cryptographic hash functions and
shared secret keys" from the National Institute of Standards and Technology,
for instance - but some of it is dangerous and even breathtaking.
WHO'S LOOKING OUT?
Bill O'Reilly's home in Manhasset, NY, published on Cryptome last year
During the past few years, Young has published detailed overhead satellite
imagery of Site R, a military installation in Pennsylvania that he claims is
Vice President Dick Cheney's undisclosed location.
Hours after the FBI
announced charges in June against four men for plotting to blow up jet-fuel
tanks at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Cryptome ran
photos of the airport tank farms, pointing out the exact route of a jet-fuel
pipeline buried beneath nearby residential neighborhoods. He regularly
publishes satellite photos of the homes of intelligence officials, including
CIA Director Michael Hayden's Washington, D.C., residence.
He has exposed
the names of what he claims are 276 British agents covertly working for MI6,
the names of 400 secret Japanese intelligence agents, and the names and home
addresses of what he claims are 2,619 CIA sources.
Young is a mad scientist of secrecy, working with little more than
monomaniacal focus and an Internet connection to turn the tables on the
spooks and expose what he regards as a worldwide criminal network of
intelligence operatives.
And the spies don't like it. After he posted the
MI6 list in 1999, the British government reportedly asked his Internet
service provider at the time to shut the site down. The company refused, but
in May of this year, his hosting service suddenly, without explanation,
announced that it would no longer have anything to do with the site. (Young
promptly relocated to another service.)
He says he has received three visits
to his home from the FBI, including one from a pair of agents with the Joint
Terrorism Task Force.
Young's enemies have tried to shut the site down with
denial-of-service attacks. Officials at the National Security Agency read
his site with interest, and everyone wants to know where he gets his
information.
So why should he believe me? As it turns out, I am not the first reporter
from Radar to interview Young. Anthony Haden-Guest, a British writer who
splits his time between New York and London and is known as a garrulous,
debonair, and well-traveled tippler, approached Young and spoke with him at
length one year ago for a Radar story that never materialized. Young finds
this curious.
He doesn't understand why Radar is so interested in Cryptome.
"It doesn't seem to be the kind of story that Radar would run," he says.
"You do this interesting, catty stuff. We don't do that. Radar is almost the
antithesis of what we do."
(Though he runs his site independently, Young
says "we" to give credit to his sources, without whom he says Cryptome
wouldn't exist.)
He watches me, gauging my reaction. He thinks there's a
story here, but it's not about him. It's about something else entirely.
"People eat your stuff up," he says.
"Congratulations on your success. The
thing is, I'd like them to eat something more toxic."
EYEBALLING JFK
Young published these shots of JFK's jet-fuel tanks hours
after a terrorist plot to blow them up was unraveled.

John Young doesn't look his age.
He "is fit and spry, and, with his coat,
tie, and "close-cropped gray hair, the picture of upper-middle-class
propriety.
Though he lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side, he wouldn't for a
moment look out of place standing on a train platform in a Connecticut
suburb with a briefcase in one hand and a Wall Street Journal in the other.
He is soft-spoken, polite, and capable of delivering vicious insults in a
measured, calm voice with just the hint of a twinkle in his eye. He has a
wicked sense of humor and an impish smile that he flashes like a
switchblade. He likes to fuck with people.
Young cheerfully agreed to meet
me in the bar of New York's Princeton Club, where his wife is a member, last
spring. It wasn't until halfway into our two-hour conversation, during which
Young was cryptic and reluctant to divulge anything but the most basic
personal details, that I realized that it wasn't an interview.
It was an
operation.
Young was born in 1935. His parents were "marginal people" and his father
worked at "menial tasks," he says, refusing to elaborate. He grew up in West
Texas.
He didn't tell me where, exactly.
"We were at the very bottom of the
social scale," he says. "And authority was the enemy. That's the
psychological background."
He attended Rice University in Houston and did a
stint in the Army Corps of Engineers before moving in 1967, at age 32, with
a wife and four children in tow, to New York to pursue a graduate degree in
architecture at Columbia University.
He studied there under James Marston
Fitch, considered the father of the historic preservation movement.
"Jim
Fitch said he was the best student he ever had," says Tyler Smith, a fellow
student and friend of Young.
In 1968, Young participated in the week-long seizure of Avery Hall, which
housed the architecture school, during Columbia's student strike. He wasn't
particularly radical, and says he joined in the protest "mainly because it
seemed much more interesting than going to school."
But the strike, and the
intellectual climate surrounding it, ignited something in him.
"He came to
Columbia as a very traditional thinker - a conservative," says Alan Feigenberg,
another student involved in the Avery Hall takeover. "A lot of the stuff we
were talking about was shocking to him. He went through a metamorphosis."
Young and his fellow Avery Hall activists founded Urban Deadline, an
activist group-cum-architecture practice that sought, improbably, to change
the world through design.
Throughout the early 1970s, Urban Deadline donated
services to the poor, built storefront schools for high school dropouts, and
scraped by on whatever paid contracts it could land.
Young, who was a few
years older than his colleagues, reluctantly took on a leadership role
despite the group's nominally egalitarian structure. Everyone wrote out
their own paychecks at the end of each week. Young's first wife died of
cancer either shortly before or shortly after his arrival at Columbia
(memories of his former classmates differ, and Young wouldn't say), leaving
him to raise their children on his own.
But, according to his fellow Urban Deadliners, he was single-mindedly devoted to the group and its radical
goals.
He delighted in his own political obstinacy, and in poking his finger
in the eye of whatever establishment figures were within reach.
"The best
term that could convey a sense of him is erratic," says Feigenberg. "And
eccentric."
When Columbia offered him a teaching position, he argued with
the dean that he shouldn't receive any payment since he had no prior
teaching experience.
Young once took out a series of ads in the small type
along the bottom of the front page of the New York Times attacking I.M. Pei:
"I.M. Pei: Why so many bad buildings?"
When he was invited to say a few
words at an opening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he told the audience
of patrons,
"I've just had a chance to look around briefly, but if you move
that Rubens and the Rembrandt and store them down in the basement, we could
put 32 units of housing in here. We're prepared to start right now."
"I have no idea how John figured out how to make a living," says Tony
Schuman, another Urban Deadliner. "I remember times when the electricity was
shut off in his apartment because he was so wrapped up in this stuff that he
hadn't bothered to find paying work. We were eating rice and beans."
Over
the years, financial necessity caused Young's classmates to peel off and
start their own practices, and Urban Deadline effectively dissolved in the
late 1970s.
"I felt like you couldn't make a life of it," says Feigenberg,
today a professor of architecture at the City College of New York. "John
felt differently. He felt that it was his life."
Cryptome started in 1994, when Young was a member of an e-mail Listserv
called Cypherpunks, whose members included such online luminaries as John
Gilmore, one of the earliest employees of Sun Microsystems, and Tim May, a
former chief scientist with Intel.
Young happened across the group when he
first got online.
The cypher-punks concerned themselves with the policy
implications of encryption technology, which at the time was a hotly debated
topic. For the first time in the history of the electronic age, private
citizens had access to powerful encryption software that allowed them to
communicate with one another without government agencies having the option
of listening in.
The NSA, which exists for no other purpose than to listen
in, objected, and a series of protracted legal battles ensued between the
federal government and privacy activists.
Philip Zimmermann, a cypher-punk
and the creator of the Pretty Good Privacy e-mail encryption software, was
investigated by the federal government in 1993 for making his software
available online, on the grounds that doing so constituted the criminal
unlicensed export of a weapon (charges were never filed).
When cypher-punks, many of whom were engineers and mathematicians working as
government contractors, needed a way to leak classified technical documents
about encryption, Young volunteered as a conduit, first using the small
hosting space that his ISP provided and later launching Cryptome as a
stand-alone site.
"My defense is, I don't know what these documents are," he
says. "It was pretty arcane stuff. We said, 'We'll put up anything that no
one else wants to put up.' That was our motto."
Within months, he started to see daily visits from
NSA computers. He'd
gotten their attention. The site quickly shed its focus on cryptography,
becoming a catch basin for random bits of information - data - about national
security and government secrecy.
Young and his wife, Deborah Natsios, who
helps him run Cryptome, assembled it all in one permanent archive, where
readers can fall through the rabbit hole for hours, scanning presidential
motorcade security procedures, reading declassified CIA case files, and
viewing enhanced photos of that mysterious bulge in the back of President
Bush's suit jacket caught on camera during the 2004 debates.
Young has
posted 41,000 files so far and averages roughly 50,000 visitors per day.
"There's a massive organization of hundreds of thousands of people around
the world totally counting on secrecy," he says of the intelligence agencies
he covers. "They are the most ?unreliable people in the world. And it's
corrupted our culture. There's nothing that should be secret. Period."
"He's a Johnny Appleseed of information," says Michael Ravnitzky, a former
investigative reporter who has made the results of his Freedom of
Information Act requests available to Young for posting. "Every time you go
there, you find things that alter your worldview and make you look at things
in a new light."
"He's a hero in a lot of ways," says Cindy Cohn, the legal director of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation. "He's done such an amazing thing in such a
quiet, steadfast way."
Young reads the Federal Register every day, files FOIA requests,
electronically clips news coverage of the intelligence world, and tracks
down court documents.
He once paid a court reporter $9,000 for the complete
transcripts of the New York trial of Osama bin Laden and 21 others for the
Kenya and Tanzania embassy bombings. (He sells a DVD archive of everything
on Cryptome for $25 apiece and sells ads on the site; aside from that, Young
covers Cryptome's costs himself.)
"Cryptome functions like a kind of scout
in the field of national security," says Steven Aftergood, director of the
Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists.
"John Young sees many things that others do not see, and posts things others
do not, or would not, post. What makes it most useful to me is not the wild
stuff, but the day in and day out monitoring of the national security
landscape."
The wild stuff: In July of 2000, a disgruntled former agent of the Public
Security Intelligence Agency, Japan's version of the CIA, leaked Young a
list of more than 400 PSIA operatives, which Young promptly published.
The
Japanese government complained about the list to the FBI, and two agents
called Young at his home to ask him to take it down.
"It was very
descriptive, and that poses a safety risk," says an FBI spokesman.
Young
refused, and published the names of the agents who called him. Three years
later, two agents with the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force dropped in on
Young unannounced.
They asked him to stop posting detailed aerial and
street-level photos of nuclear installations, and to pass along any
information he received that might help them unravel terrorist plots.
"The
complaint was, 'Is there some way to persuade you not to do these things?'"
Young says. "They were nice guys, always very polite. They were a little
sheepish about it."
Young refused to take down the offending images, and
told the agents that if he came across any information about terrorist
threats, they could read about it on the site. After they left, he published
the names of his visitors on Cryptome.
EXPLODED VIEW
On the eve of Bush's second inaugural,
Young published a
"survey of presidential protection,"
including this illustration of the
presidential Cadillac swiped from popularmechanics.com
The British Secret Intelligence Service, also known as MI6, was too canny to
approach him directly, but it did reportedly try to get him booted off his
ISP, after he published, in 1999, a list of more than 100 MI6 agents that
had been released originally by former agent Richard Tomlinson on sites
based in the U.S. and Switzerland.
Those sites removed the list at the
request of the British government, but Young grabbed it before it went
offline.
Since then he's added two more batches of names.
"We don't discuss
personnel," says an SIS spokesperson. "But it's obviously unhelpful and
dangerous when these names are published."
"I would regard the damage he's doing as considerable," says Peter Earnest,
a 36-year veteran of the CIA who now serves as the executive director of the
International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C.
Earnest is also the chairman of
the board of directors of the Association for Intelligence Officers, a group
of retired spies, military intelligence officers, and even some journalists
who cover intelligence, whose membership list - complete with addresses - Young
published in 2000.
"I think it's serious. We just finished a trial over Valerie Plame, and that was just one person. I don't know what purpose it
serves aside from aiding people who would do them harm."
Even Young's admirers admit he goes over the line.
"I think it's
irresponsible," says Aftergood. "Publishing the home address of the Director
of National Intelligence is not something I'd fight for. If an individual
whose cover was exposed on Cryptome comes to harm, or if a facility that's
highlighted - I can't even say it."
To Young, complaints about agents' safety is pure tradecraft. You can't
argue with spies, because everything they say is a lie. Former covert
operatives have told him as much, he says.
"They say, 'Don't believe that,
it's just standard fare. It's a ploy.' If you believe any of this, you don't
understand how spies operate. They lie so much and run so many false
operations and plant so many false agents. They expose their own agents so
much - there's nothing you can do that they haven't already done. In fact,
they hope you will do it. To muddy the waters."
UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS
Young took this photo at Site R, the Pennsylvania
mountain bunker
that reportedly served as Dick Cheney's "undisclosed
location" after September 11
For 90 minutes, through one and a half salted margaritas, John Young has
been eyeballing me, speaking softly, fidgeting with the digital recorder
I've placed in front of him.
He's heard all the questions I am asking
before, and he answers them carefully and pleasantly. Then he tells me why
he's here.
A few years ago, Anthony Haden-Guest called Young and asked to meet him for
a drink. Haden-Guest, who wrote a book about Studio 54's glory days and is a
two-time winner of Spy magazine's Ironman Nightlife Decathlon, is known in
media circles as something of a hapless rogue, full of astonishing, barely
believable yarns. His brother is Christopher Guest, one of the creators of
This Is Spinal Tap and the director of A Mighty Wind.
Haden-Guest has a
habit of calling magazine editors out of the blue from Chad or Syria with a
great story. He is a contributor to Radar and a personal friend of Radar's
editor in chief.
Haden-Guest wasn't on an assignment when he called Young, he was just
interested in Cryptome. Over drinks, Young says, a loquacious Haden-Guest
offered a confession: He has been accused of being an agent for MI6, he told
Young. In fact, Young says, Haden-Guest revealed that he actually had on one
occasion done some unpaid work, as a favor, for British intelligence by
writing a report while traveling in the Middle East.
This was all in the
strictest of confidence, Young says:
"He said, 'You must never repeat
this.'"
Afterward, Haden-Guest wrote a brief, laudatory article about Young
for a British newspaper. Roughly one year prior to my interview with Young,
Haden-Guest called Young again and proposed doing a more involved story on
him for Radar. They met at Haden-Guest's New York apartment for three hours,
Young says, and Haden-Guest tape-recorded the conversation. Young never
heard from him again.
Young dribbles out this information in bits and pieces, changing the subject
abruptly before returning to Haden-Guest and suggestively dropping another
nugget - did I know that he had been incarcerated by the Germans as a child
during World War II? - and studying my reaction. Eventually, it dawns on me
what Young is getting at: He thinks Anthony Haden-Guest is a British agent.
He thinks MI6 sent Haden-Guest to "ping" him - "like a radar ping; try a ping
and see what comes back" - using a fake Radar interview as a pretext.
And he
thinks I have something to do with it.
As it happens, Haden-Guest had indeed written a 565-word story about
Cryptome for Radar. The piece was Radar's idea. When he became too busy to
work on the story, it was killed and reassigned to me.
For months and months, Young had sat on this data he'd collected, waiting to
hear back from Haden-Guest about the story. Nothing. Then, out of the blue,
I'd sent him an e-mail saying that, once again, Radar would like to
interview him.
So he showed up to ping me.
"That's why I'm meeting you," he
says matter-of-factly, locking eyes with mine. "Don't forget, you're all
supposedly suspect. The thing is, I told [Haden-Guest] the full story, and
he got it on tape. And it was sent off somewhere else. Being a reporter is a
standard cover story. So, if you don't know that's out there - that is what I
think about you. It's what I think about him, too."
Young believes that
Haden-Guest and I are both working on stories about him.
But for MI6, not
Radar.
MASTER SPY?
Anthony Haden-Guest
I glance around at the tables next to us, concerned that someone might
overhear our conversation. I don't know if it's because I don't want them to
hear the paranoid rantings of a lunatic, or because I don't want them to
hear the "truth" about Anthony Haden-Guest.
It is a simple and harmless set
of facts: Radar killed Haden-Guest's story and handed it to me. That's not
evidence of espionage. And so what if he bragged that people think he's a
spy? Haden-Guest has been regaling acquaintances with fantastical-seeming
tales for decades.
Why, if he really were an agent, would he volunteer
- to
John Young, of all people - that he's suspected of being an agent?
"It's
standard tradecraft," Young explains.
What seems like a reporter's effort to
butter up a subject by appealing to his interest is also a tactic used by
agents to inoculate themselves against being uncovered. It muddies the
waters.
And why wouldn't MI6 send someone to ping the man who'd ousted 276 of
their agents, to see what clues he may inadvertently give up about his
sources? And who better than a reporter?
In John Young's world, Spy magazine's Nightlife Decathlete may well be an
actual spy. The more Young talks about it, the less absurd it sounds. There
are the random phone calls from third world hotspots. There was the episode
in the 1980s when Haden-Guest was kidnapped in Beirut while traveling with a
DEA informant who claimed he was working undercover on a heroin sting.
There
was the strange story in the British edition of Esquire about the Middle
East intelligence-gathering exploits of his friend "CK," who is "a
mercenary, if you like, one of the rare agents on the ground in this
high-tech epoch." But in the end, this was still the man who once appeared
on a panel discussion with Randy Jones of the Village People.
I slowly come to see the point of Young's constant references to "common
tradecraft," and "standard fare": He lives in this world every day.
We see
headlines now and again. We know - and quickly forget - that the CIA tailed Fox
News Channel's Brit Hume, then a reporter for the late muckraking columnist
Jack Anderson, in the 1970s.
That it kidnapped German citizen Khaled el-Masri
in Macedonia, shoved a tranquilizer suppository up his ass, chained him to
the floor of a plane, and flew him to an Afghan secret prison in 2004. That
the NSA is capable of listening in on any communication, anywhere. This is
what they do. It's not so crazy to imagine they'd check in on someone like
Young. It's standard.
You just have to know what to look for.
As Young lays out his case, he oscillates abruptly, and at a disorienting
pace, between charm and hostility. He is furious at Haden-Guest. He feels
like he's been had.
A relatively well-known media figure has all but told
him that he's an agent, using a magazine as cover, and for some
reason - Affection? Vanity? - Young hasn't posted a word of it to Cryptome.
"Now Cryptome is on the hook," he says. "It was a terrible mistake not to out
this guy. I out everybody else. I agreed to keep a secret. I'm opposed to
secrecy."
He rants about the betrayal, then drops it, and tells me that he's
willing to put me in touch with good sources for national security stories.
Then he insults me. A half-hour ago he said he found Radar "delightful"; now
he finds it insipid.
I point out to him that he's alternating between
affability and belligerence, and he bangs on the table with glee, delighted
that I noticed.
"That is a practiced technique," he says. "It's called
whipsawing."
Young points out how easy it was for me to set up the interview, how
accessible he made himself to me.
"See, it's standard tradecraft in the spy
world to be extremely cooperative to people who are expecting resistance.
You just offer all possible help, and they just walk right into it. Did you
really think I'd let you interview me, rather than me interview you? I'm
plumbing your data. I've learned a lot about how Radar operates. I'm just
doing the usual shit that agents do to recruit other agents."
Am I being recruited?
"Yes."
My mission, should I choose to accept it: Find out what happened to
Haden-Guest's story, and write about Haden-Guest's alleged MI6 connection
in Radar.
If I don't, Young will write about it on Cryptome.
"I don't
believe you for a minute that you're any different from Haden-Guest," Young
rants. "I'm about to get fucked over again. Radar's behind this. Turns out,
you're on my shit list. I'm only talking to you to figure out what happened,
and what I'm going to make of it. It doesn't look good. Until you find out
what this story was and why it was killed, I only have vengeance in my mind
against Radar and anyone associated with it."
"Or you know," he says, flashing his teeth, "maybe it's a fucking con job
I'm giving you, and you're about to get eaten alive by Anthony Haden-Guest.
He's more famous than me. And so it's kind of interesting what you'll do
with this. I'll give you a month."
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
John Young
In person and online, Young casts himself as an outsider and misanthrope.
There is some truth to this portrayal.
At the same time, he has done
architectural work for some of the most powerful members of the political
establishment that he has sworn to attack.
"It's an easy way to make money in New York, to do corrupt work," he says
with a shrug.
He has worked for the
Council on Foreign Relations, the bête
noire of the conspiracy set. He was, for six years in the 1980s, the
consulting architect to the Pierre, a Fifth Avenue apartment hotel that has
been home to Sumner Redstone and Mohamed Al Fayed.
His résumé cites work on
developer Kirk Kerkorian's residence there.
During the renovation of Grand
Central Terminal in the 1990s, he was hired to document the existing
structure and spent days in the rafters above the vaulted Main Concourse,
meticulously measuring beams. He is respected enough in his field to have
been selected, in 1998, for the nominating committee for the Chrysler Award
for Innovation in Design.
He nominated James Bell, a Washington man who was
convicted in 2001 of stalking U.S. Treasury agents, for Bell's online essay,
"Assassination Politics," which Young described as "an imaginative and
sophisticated prospective for improving governmental accountability by way
of a scheme for anonymous, untraceable political assassination."
If it's incongruous to imagine a paranoid, spy-hating anarchist going over
blueprints with Mrs. Kerkorian, consider the preposterous, cosmically
incomprehensible case of John Young's late father-in-law.
Young has been
married at least three times; in 1993 he met his current wife, Deborah Natsios, the daughter of
Nicholas Natsios, a career CIA officer who served
in Vietnam, Iran, and elsewhere.
Young disclosed the fact on Cryptome in
2000:
"My father-in-law was a longtime career officer in the Central
Intelligence Agency, one of its earliest members, and chief of station in
several countries.... He's not talking to Cryptome, and that's regrettable,
for I believe such knowledgeable persons should disclose everything they
know about the global culture of secret intelligence and its profound
effects - to better inform citizens on the true way their governments
function."
When Young published the membership list of the Association for
Intelligence Officers four months later, Nicholas Natsios's name and home
address were on it.
Natsios died in 2004.
When I called his daughter
Christine Natsios - Young's sister-in-law - to ask her what she thought of Cryptome, she replied,
"This is a family matter, and it's none of your
business."
Deborah Natsios's cousin is Andrew Natsios, currently the State Department's
special envoy to Sudan and formerly the administrator of the Agency for
International Development, appointed by George W. Bush. The CIA is commonly
thought to use USAID positions as cover overseas. Disclosing the
relationship on Cryptome, Young described him as a "low-paid hardworking
honest guy mired in a hopelessly venal fat-cat system."
The closest Young comes to explaining to me why he created Cryptome is this:
"I'm a pretty fucking angry guy."
He describes it as a public education
project.
But for every hard data point he offers, there's the ever-present
admonishment that secrecy corrupts everything.
"We caution people, don't
believe anything we publish," he says. "We're totally untrustworthy. We may
be a sting operation, we may be working for the Feds. If you trust us,
you're stupid."
It's like a nihilist art project: Provide your readers with
more than 40,000 files of data the government doesn't want you to have, data
that exposes the lies of the powerful, and then remind them that you can
never, ever know for sure who is lying.
John Young didn't give me a month
The next day he wrote Haden-Guest an
e-mail, which he also posted on Cryptome:
"I have recommended John Cook
speak to you about Cryptome and your dead article for Radar, and yourself.
Cook's interview of me last night evening [sic] was vapid in the Radar
mode - no preparation, ignorant, shallow. He has a recording of it, so you two
might exchange raw data."
He didn't return further e-mails or phone calls.
Several days later, when Young started getting calls and e-mails from
friends alerting him to my inquiries for this story, he posted this:
"Cook
is sucking up to a slew of folks in the U.S. and elsewhere gathering
material for a Cryptome smear.... Excellent, feed him sewage, I urge.... I
referred him to Anthony Haden-Guest... who got three hours on tape of my
crap in 2006 for a Radar story that never appeared. Well, never appeared in
public; who got it can be mused.
Sucking up, Guest bragged of his periodic
voluntary work for MI6, and that he was suspected of being a spy around New
York City (standard bar pick-up talk).... Cook said he didn't have the time
or interest to read Cryptome. Agreed, I said, it's off Radar's screen, so
what's your purpose? He said, 'Who are your sources?' literally pushing the
recorder closer to me."
Young continued to post his correspondence about me with various friends and
relatives I had contacted for this story. His daughter Anina Young, who
operates an online clothing store in New York, asked me to put my questions
in an e-mail; she never replied, but the e-mail showed up on Cryptome two
days later.
Young called Radar a "vile magazine," accused me of "hounding"
his family, and advised his associates that I would tell them a "mixture of
truth and lies" in order to "seduce and betray" them.
"Expect to [be] abused
and hurt by the process if you want to join the nasty fun," he wrote.
When I called Haden-Guest to let him know what Young had been saying about
him, he replied that he had never told Young that he was commonly suspected
of being a spy, or that he worked for British intelligence, and insisted
that he had never done a thing for British intelligence.
He said he wished
he had let Young know about the disposition of his story, but had been
preoccupied with moving back to London from New York City.
He was concerned
that someone like Young would spread a false rumor that he was MI6.
"That's
heavy," he said.
A few days later, Haden-Guest sent Radar an e-mail elaborating on Young's
claims, chalking them up in part to anger over the fact that the original
story never appeared:
"Clearly the non-publication angered Young greatly. At
our second meeting, I had mentioned a piece of reporting I had done at the
beginning of the Iraq war. I had accompanied a buccaneering freelance
intelligence operation in Cyprus, Syria, and Lebanon, looking for WMD.
My
presence had been cleared by a deputy undersecretary at the Pentagon, but
was not greeted with enthusiasm by his British counterpart. Very much the
reverse. The piece was published in Esquire. This is, I suppose, the report
to which Young refers."
Toward the end of my conversation with Young, he returned to the question
that plagues him:
"Why do I believe you? Radar is a piece of shit. Saying
that you work for Radar and we're going to do this in September, that's a
bullshit story."
Then he said he had to wake up early in the morning.
"It
was good to see you," he said with a smile. "I don't get out much."
On our way out, he invited me upstairs to have a look at the Princeton
Club's second-floor lounge area.
He had mentioned earlier in our
conversation that the club had gone downhill, and how pleasant the sitting
area once was. I let him lead the way. His insults were still reverberating
in my head; I was reeling from the notion that I was involved, unwittingly,
tangentially, in an operation to spy on this 71-year-old man. He had been
berating me not 20 minutes earlier, and here he was, utterly charming,
leading me up the wide staircase into an empty room filled with stuffed
chairs and reading lamps.
It was late. We could barely hear the chatter from the bar downstairs.
-
Was
he testing me, to see how I'd react if asked to follow him into a secluded
area?
-
Was I about to feel a sharp pinch in my shoulder blade and fade to
black?
-
Why was he doing this?
We walked into the lounge area. He stopped and let me walk a few feet ahead.
I turned back to look at him.
"It used to be much nicer," he sighed.
THE CRYPTOME FILES
The most controversial posts from John Young's Cryptome
BUNKER BUSTER
With his website,
Cryptome, John Young aims to publish
forbidden information,
including these photos of Dick Cheney's mountain
bunker
John L. Young, the obsessive genius behind
Cryptome, has been infuriating
governments worldwide for years by assembling a library of sensitive, often
classified, information about intelligence-gathering and national security.
Below is a list of some of his more illuminating chestnuts:
-
Dick Cheney's "undisclosed location": Satellite photos and aerial maps of
"Site R," a military installation dug into a Pennsylvania mountainside that
Young says is Cheney's secret hideaway. He also posted photos he took during
a field trip to the site.
-
The names and addresses of 2,619 "CIA sources": Young first published this
list in December 2000, describing it as a list of CIA sources passed on by
an anonymous tipster. It turned out to be the membership directory of the
Association for Intelligence Officers, a group largely made up of retired
CIA agents. One of the names on the list was Nicholas Natsios, Young's
father-in-law, who was a career CIA officer.
-
The names of 276 British intelligence agents: Young first published 116
names of agents for MI6, Britain's foreign intelligence arm, in 1999; by
2005 he'd collected 276 names. The British government reportedly tried to
get Young's ISP to take the list down; it refused. An MI6 spokesperson told
Radar that publishing the names is "unhelpful and dangerous."
-
The names of roughly 600 Japanese intelligence agents: After Young published
this list of names of operatives for Japan's Public Security Investigation
Agency - the Japanese equivalent of the CIA - an FBI agent called Young and
asked him to take the names off his site. He refused.

Photos of the jet fuel tanks and pipelines surrounding John F. Kennedy
International Airport, posted immediately after the announcement of a
"terrorist plot" to blow them up in June.
