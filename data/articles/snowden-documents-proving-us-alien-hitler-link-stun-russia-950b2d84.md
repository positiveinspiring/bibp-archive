Former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden revealed documents providing incontrovertible proof that an alien/extraterrestrial intelligence agenda is driving US domestic and international policy, and has been doing so since at least 1945, some media reports said. A stunning Federal Security Services (FSB) report on the nearly two million highly classified top-secret documents obtained from the United States Department of Defense (DOD) run National Security Agency-Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) by the American ex-patriot Edward Snowden states that this information is providing,
"incontrovertible proof" that an "alien/extraterrestrial intelligence agenda" is driving US domestic and international policy,
...and has been doing so since at least 1945, Whatdoesitmean.com reported. Edward Snowden is a computer specialist, a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former NSA/CSS contractor who disclosed these classified documents to several media outlets in late 2012 and was granted temporary asylum in Russia in 2013 after his designation by the Obama regime as the,
"most wanted man on earth."
This FSB report further states that Snowden, in December, 2012, contacted the highly respected American columnist, blogger, and author Glenn Greenwald by an email headed with the subject line stating,
"I and others have things you would be interested in...?"
In Snowden's own words, this report continues, he outlined to Greenwald the reason for his highly secretive group obtaining and releasing these documents by warning that that there,
"were actually two governments in the US, the one that was elected, and the other, secret regime, governing in the dark."
As to who is running this "secret regime" Snowden and his cohorts were warning about, FSB experts in this report say, was confirmed this past weekend by former Canadian defense minister Paul Hellyer who was given access to all of Snowden's documents by Russian intelligence services and stated they were, indeed, "accurate." Even though Defense Minister Hellyer's exact statements to the FSB in regards to Snowden's documents remain classified, shortly after his "extensive electronic interview" by the FSB he was allowed to appear on Russia Today's program SophieCo this past fortnight where he shockingly admitted that aliens have "been visiting our planet for thousands of years" and described several types of these extraterrestrials, including "Tall Whites" who are working with the US Air Force in Nevada.
Of the many explosive revelations in this FSB report, the one most concerning to Russian authorities are the Snowden's documents "confirming" that the "Tall Whites" (further revealed by Defense Minister Hellyer as noted above) are the same extraterrestrial alien race behind the stunning rise of Nazi Germany during the 1930's. In just one example of the many outlined in this FSB report, it shows that with this "alien assistance," at the end of the 1930's, when Nazi Germany possessed just 57 submarines, over the four years of World War II it built 1,163 modern technologically advanced submarines at its dockyards and even put them into operation. Snowden's documents further confirm, this report says, the "Tall Whites" (Nordic) meetings in 1954 with US President Dwight D. Eisenhower where the "secret regime" currently ruling over America was established. Most disturbingly, this FSB report warns, is that the "Tall White" agenda being implemented by the "secret regime" ruling the United States calls for the creation of a global electronic surveillance system meant to hide all true information about their presence here on earth as they enter into what one of Snowden's documents calls the "final phase" of their end plan for total assimilation and world rule. Unbeknownst to the FSB, this report confirms, are those still in the US government backing Snowden, but whose presence Russian intelligence experts note is "unmistakable" and shows a cataclysmic power struggle is currently underway against this "secret regime" now headed by Obama by "forces unknown." Most to be feared by Russian policy makers and authorities, this report concludes, is if those opposing the "Tall White" 'secret regime' ruled over by Obama have themselves aligned with another alien-extraterrestrial power themselves.
Note
This report has been wired from Whatdoesitmean.com.
As you can see, we have both mentioned and hyperlinked the source of this report and also released it in the wire section of our website to notify our viewers that all responsibility for the veracity, authenticity and reliability of this report lies with its original source, whatdoesitmean.com.
The wired report further mentioned that former Canadian Defense Minister Paul Hellyer has confirmed Snowden's remarks and expressed his supportive views in an interview with Russia Today after he was given access to all of Snowden's documents by Russian intelligence services.
To help our readers with more relevant sources of information we included the video of Hellyer's interview with RT, where he said extraterrestrial beings are amongst us and if we down at least one UFO, we'll be facing an interstellar war, and that Apollo astronaut, Edgar Mitchell, told him there were something around two and twelve spices of aliens visiting the Earth, and that the aliens have provided people in the American government with military technology.
The interview had been released on December 30, 2013 that is a few days before the whatdoesitmean report. Yet, again this does not mean that we support or reject Hellyer's views. What is interesting here is how professional media outlets in the West, who are well informed of the wiring rules and technique, have tried hard to attribute the story to FNA in naive forms, ignoring the hyperlinked source and the RT video completely, and the first western media which rushed to make some use of this story to somehow link it to the worldview of a part of the Iranian political community was Washington Post, while a brief look at the archives of the western media outlets shows how they were trying to convince the world for even two decades after the World War II that Hitler and the Nazi Germany were driven by extraterrestrial beings.
A February 1957 report by Reuters and Washington Post went so far to say that the Nazi Germany developed flying saucers that could flew 1,000 miles an hour to invade the US. Most western media outlets have either completely ignored the RT video and the wired nature of this report, or mentioned its original source only at the end of their stories to first convince their readers that the story fully belongs to FNA. And to those of you who may ask why we have basically carried this story, we should say that FNA has been seeking to inform its viewers of those stories which are ignored by the mainstream media, specially in the West.
A part of our daily efforts is focused on such reports. In doing so, we sometimes try to cover some specially controversial - topics with different reports to give our viewers a chance to study them from various perspectives.
When the Occupy Wall Street Movement was ignored by the mainstream media in the West, we were almost among the first in the world to cover it on a daily basis for months. It is also interesting that on the same day that the 'whatdoesitmean story' was released, we also wired a report, 'PRISM Mining UFO Data - Targets False Flag ET Invasion as Pretext to Space Wars', from Examiner to provide an opportunity for our viewers to deal with this topic from a different perspective.
Yet again the mainstream media in the West which is looking for a scapegoat to blame Iran and the Iranians ignored it completely. Finally, some of our viewers have complained that they have not been able to view the video and demanded a script of the Former Canadian Defense Minister's statements.
For those of our viewers, here is the full text of Mr. Hellyer's remarks according to Russia Today:
