Iceland President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson tells Al Jazeera's Stephen
Cole that Europe should let banks that are ran "irresponsibly" go bankrupt.
Speaking at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Grimsson also held his
country as a model of economic recovery after its near-collapse four years
ago.
"We didn't follow the traditional prevailing
orthodoxies. And the end result four years later is that Iceland is
enjoying progress and recovery."
"Why do
we consider banks to be like holy churches?",
...
is the rhetorical question that Iceland's President asks (and answers) in
this truly epic three minutes of truthiness from the farce that is the World
Economic Forum in Davos.
Amid a week of back-slapping and
self-congratulatory party-outdoing,
as John Aziz notes, the Icelandic President
explains why his nation is growing strongly, why unemployment is negligible,
and how they moved from the world's poster-child for banking crisis 5 years
ago to a thriving nation once again.
Simply put, he says,
"we
didn't follow the prevailing orthodoxies of the last 30 years in the
Western world."
There are
lessons here for everyone - as Grimson explains the process of
creative destruction that remains much
needed in Western economies - though we suspect his holographic pass for
next year's Swiss fun will be reneged...
