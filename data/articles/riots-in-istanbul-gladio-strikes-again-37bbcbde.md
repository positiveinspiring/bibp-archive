Is Turkey next for the CIAs
spring cleaning?
It certainly looks that way, from all the clues
surrounding the huge riots
that have developed seemingly overnight in
Istanbul
and other large cities.
Ostensibly the trouble began over the plans by
the Istanbul municipality to redevelop part of Gezi Park close to Taksim
(Constitution) Square, situated in the heart of the countrys largest city.
Suddenly - and suspiciously - numbers or
protestors swelled dramatically and the police, never renowned for their
lightness of touch,
moved in with full-scale anti-riot tactics.
In the subsequent violence the situation turned
from an ecological occupy sort of protest to a
rolling stone with all the
indications of the popular demonstrations which appeared in not dissimilar
circumstances in Egypt, Tunisia and Tripoli.
Each demonstration of the popular pro-democracy
will ended with the removal of the existing authorities. Libyas leader,
Colonel Gadaffi, was murdered. Turkeys Erdoğan has
already called the protesters "marauders."
Turkey has long been a source of discontent in
western circles, notably the CIA and the US state department. This is
entirely because the country is in the hands of soft Islamic power which won
three victories in a row by landslide majorities.
The election of the Justice and Development
Party (AK Party) emerged as a source of hope after years of instability,
chaos and economic backwardness. The new AK leaders switched on a humming
dynamo of economic reforms which transformed the slothful
economy into a huge source of growth.
Only last week, the government repaid the last
installment on an outstanding loan contracted from the IMF by the former
secular governments, whose only legacy was massive unemployment and zero
growth.
The AK people crossed an especially dangerous
red line when they fell out with
Israel
over the Marmara Incident, in which nine
Turkish citizens on board a Gazan relief vessel were killed by Israel
commandoes. Ankara all but broke off of full diplomatic relations with
Israel. Effectively long established friendly co-operation between Turkey,
the second largest NATO power, and Israel pitched into the deep freeze.
Turks are tasting sweet success for the first
time since the reign of the founder Mustapha Kamal Ataturk, which
matters a good deal more than scrap
with Israel.
The AK party managed for the first time to
bridge the gap between the pious Islamist majority, the quiescent
conservatives seeking dramatic reforms, and neo-liberals. The coalition did
not include the stoutly secular army or the former secular parties who
suddenly found themselves out in the cold, all their power and privileged
snatched away.
So why are Turks now apparently in a revolting
mood against the very authorities who delivered the long sought boons of
prosperity? The answer is this: some are, but the majority of Turks are
against any change in government and still less any meddling with the hugely
beneficial forms.
We see before us the classic example of
rent-a-crowd. Many of the violent demonstrators are off duty members of the
armed forces acting as agents provocateur (an old story in Turkey).
They are deployed by the military High Command
which seeks vengeance for
the long running Ergenekon scandal which has seen many of the most
senior officers arrested, tried and jailed for conspiring to overthrow the
government.

Ergenekon (it means iron
mountain in Turkish) is the
direct successor of Counter-Guerilla, the NATO sponsored deep state
force involved in four attempts at overthrowing elected Turkish
authorities, three successful, two of them extremely bloody.
These new disturbances feature all the same
players: the whisky generals of the Turkish High Command, extreme Right
anti-Islamic paramilitaries, secretive units of the national gendarmerie,
gangs associated with the Turkish criminal underground, and not least the
very same secular parties (notably the main opposition force, CHP) who found
all the sweet joys of office and power snatched away when the AK leadership
came to power.
Turkeys Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,
generally a master tactician, for once failed to spot the looming danger. He
refused to treat the original eco protest seriously, still less appreciate
the fuel supplied by the anti-Islamic forces backed by western interests.
When the protests spilled into the highly
emotional Taksim Square (traditionally the seat of popular protest), he
miscalculated the increasing danger to the AK authorities.
It is not too late to turn the situation around,
but that would require a defeat for Erdogan who is bent on a plan to turn
Istanbul into the most impressive modern metropolis on earth.
There are many Turks uneasy at the huge
demolitions required for the projected third Bosporus bridge, for example.
Erdogan reacted insensitively and found himself accused of steam-rolling
popular resentment and concern.
So he now finds himself the victim of a long
prepared plan, quiet kept in the locker, to overthrow the AK government when
the appropriate circumstances ripened. They have.
We are watching a new roll-out of the
Counter-Guerrilla/Gladio
blueprint which undermined and brought down previous Turkish
governments that strayed across the lines of political correctness in the
eyes of to western strategists.
Erdoğan and the president and chief ally,
Abdullah Gul, will need a good deal more than and courage soothing words
- still less over-reactions on the ground - to put this fire out.
These are perilous times for all Turks.
