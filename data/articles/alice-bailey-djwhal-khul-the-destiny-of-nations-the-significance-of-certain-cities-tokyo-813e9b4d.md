I would here point out that in these interrelations is no inevitable fate or unavoidable destiny. The aim of the individual disciple is to handle the forces which play through him in such a manner that only constructive good can eventuate. He can misuse energy or employ it for soul ends. So it is with nations and races. The fate of a nation lies in the hands of its leaders usually; they marshal the nation's forces, focus the national intent (if intuitive enough) and develop the characteristics of the people, leaving in fact behind them the memory of symbols of national intent, ideals or corruption. This can be seen as it worked out in a demonstrable way in the two great guiding groups of world leaders during the war. The three Axis groups of leaders, dominated by the evil German group, with Italy and Japan fighting at intervals against the evil influence (consciously seldom but unconsciously often), and the second group - the leaders of the Allied Cause. No matter what past history may indicate in connection with many of the allied nations (past aggressions, ancient cruelties and wrong doing), they were and are today seeking to cooperate with the Forces of Light and are endeavoring to salvage human freedom - political, religious and economic.
