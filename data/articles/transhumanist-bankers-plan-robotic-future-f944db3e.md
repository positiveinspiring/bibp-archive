International airports in Britain greet arrivals and departures with the
letters 'HSBC' and the words "The World's Bank" plastered boldly over plane
docking bays and passenger corridors.
For those not in the know
HSBC is,
"A British multinational banking and
financial services organization headquartered in London, England."
"It is One of the largest banking and
financial services institutions in the world, servicing around fifty
eight million customers through four Global Businesses."
Now the thing about HSBC is that it is
interested in more than just banking (in common with most others) and it
believes that it has 'seen the future'.
Walking down the ramp to enter the plane for Poland at London's Stansted
airport, I was greeted once again by HSBC's pervasive branding. However this
time, the letters appeared above a large picture of a bumble bee... but the
humble bumble didn't look quite right; it had been half engineered into
a 'bee-bot (robot)'.
In large letters above this unfortunate insect
appear the words,
"In The Future - Nature and Technology Will
Work as One".
Now mechanized, non animal 'bots' (officially 'nano-bots')
are the latest little flying military spy machines.
No bigger than an actual bee - they are
apparently capable of flying in swarms straight through your open living or
bedroom window - and flying out again replete with photographic data gleaned
while hovering around your home. Their creators suggest that the 'bots'
might be capable of dispensing a lethal sting into their victim as well.
It's like mini drone technology whose intended
victims are none other than... us?
Seeing "In the Future - Nature and Technology Will Work as One" with 'HSBC'
in bold above it - gave me on of those "Oh my God!" moments.
HSBC is implicated up to it's neck in most of
the rotten scams that
the banking fraternity has pulled on it's
customers over the past decade or so - and is now continuing in the same
vein by planting an almost surreally dark message into the public mind.
The message being conveyed is simple enough:
the bankers are to continue their power play
for total control by announcing their backing of the ultimate mutation
of nature.
The ultimate mutation of nature?
That's close enough to the mark:
how would you describe the conjoining of
nature and technology within a living organism for the purpose of
advancing the total dehumanization of homo sapiens?
Put another way:
the usurping of the natural laws that govern
our behavior through the substitution of man-made simulated versions
governed by a programmed computer chip.
In the case of the 'bots' - a chip instructing
its vehicle to carry out covert and overt spying and assassination raids
on... well, maybe anyone who refuses to be a slave.
It's a regime that intends to make it impossible to make any distinction
between an 'engineered animal' and an 'animalized engine'. Needlessly to
say, both concepts are nefarious aberrations and should never even get as
far as a drawing board.
Yet this kind of thing is not exactly new. There are plenty of examples of
animals having been used and abused to carry out war-like missions against
stubborn enemies; or indeed being the subject of thousands of laboratory
experiments of various kinds.
Today, laboratories continue their experiments
with the
genetic engineering of farm animals to turn
them into walking butchers' shops.
Laboratory design teams have already managed to
splice human growth promoting genes into pigs - with biotech corporations
expressing the desire to patent the resulting transgenic animals so as to
claim ownership of their blood-lines. Franken Foods remain an ever
present threat to us all.
What we have with HSBC's 'nano-bots' is a direct extension of transgenic
engineering. Their advert is an in-your-face pronouncement that the bank
'has seen the future' and is going to put it's customers' savings into
making that future come to be.
Say this advertisement had announced,
"We are splicing your genes into our pigs -
enjoy your dinner", that would, in all probability, have provoked an
instant outcry by outraged citizens.
But "In the Future - Nature and Technology Will
Work as One" will likely not have that affect upon the majority of 21st
century neocortex's.
On the contrary - it probably will sound rather
soothing - like 'ah, no more painful conflicts with nature.' And that is
undoubtedly the intention.
But just under the surface lies an extraordinary admission of dark intent by
this leading British bank - bringing into razor sharp focus just how
pathologically insane the world of big business has become.
Also just how immersed governments have become
in holding hands with these corporate despots and jointly paving the way to
a post Orwellian 'New
World Order'.
The nano-bot is an accompaniment of
the Transhumanist Movement. A movement that
coolly informs that at some point in the future, humans will be out-competed
by cyborgs.
That
the 'brain' we invent will outperform the
one we used to invent it. That 'humans' will become redundant while
soul-less automatons that can 'think and feel' will take over all areas of
society where human hands and minds once prevailed.
Their 'decisions' will then challenge ours and
courts of law will be hard pressed to know how to sentence or convict an
insentient cyborg when it has carried out an act of murder, or any other
crime for that matter.
While one can perhaps share a hollow laugh at the thought of such a bizarre
state of affairs, we cannot easily dismiss it's rapid ascension into the
world of earthly reality.
As if to fortify this point, Jaron Larnier,
the author and inventor of
Virtual Reality, recently warned that
digital infrastructure was,
"moving beyond human control."
We are perhaps 50% down that road at this very
moment.
Many have already been hypnotized by their gismo
dominated daily lives and by the ease and speed with which transactions,
free from any human contact, can take place 'online'. Many have been seduced
by the 'thinking' I-pod/smart phone and become accustomed to spending hours
in virtual realities.
Places that subtly prepare the unwary for the
'virtual' to make it's next appearance as the 'actual'.
Many have been anaesthetized to the point where
their actions become out of sync with their brains; so when something deeply
shocking is experienced - it is proceeded by a certain numbness - and a
failure to react with emotional empathy or natural spontaneity.
We are, in other words, being moved ever closer to the machine state,
while the machine is being moved ever closer to the human state.
What the HSBC is proclaiming is the crossing
over point. A time when the majority of mankind will have surrendered
itself to blind belief in the technology it invented - and accepted a
sterile, inhuman and robotic second place for itself:
The blue pill...
You would be surprised by the seductiveness of this 'take-over'. It fulfils
a barely human, yet prevalent desire in many to relieve themselves of
responsibility for the management of their lives and of the fate of this
planet. It offers an escape route through which can pass all those who feel
overwhelmed by the task of making rational decisions or of giving birth to
creative instincts.
In fact, for most unquestioning followers of the
status quo - it follows a natural progression from their current state of
insentient, dumbed down conformity.
I'm painting this dark, because it is. But I don't believe it's
the future - I believe it's the present - and that 'thinking
humanity' can and will overcome this Orwellian fate.
We are there. We have arrived at that great threshold - that great turning -
which offers all who can still feel a sentient living pulse of life coursing
through their veins - the chance to renew their contract with our Creator.
To choose Life. To celebrate Life! And to draw a symbolic Arthurian sword
against all that debases, destroys and dehumanizes our divine fire.
We will not and cannot capitulate. We are indeed enormously fortunate to
have this chance to look the devil straight in the eye. We humans have never
been more overtly confronted with the deathly masque of deception than we
are today.
It's shouting at us on the front page of every
national newspaper, every TV news program, every political maneuver, every
military maneuver, every large scale banking transaction, every hypermarket
and shopping mall sell and in every artifice of mass consumerism.
All designed to fog, torment and torture that
divine spark that is our living essence.
The cyborg sycophants and the HSBC's of this world feed on those who fear
the realization of their own inner powers. Pay them no heed my friends, for
we are just entering a long period of rejoicing in the dazzling beauty of
those very powers - and will not be bowing to anyone or anything that tries
to block our collective emancipation.
Now is the time to draw on the true light that is so freely available, at
all times, to all people. Use it to unmask and unseat those who think they
are in control of our destinies. Reveal them for the empty cyphers they
truly are.
Their threats are paper thin when held against
the flame of truth and the well-spring of love - and will turn to ashes
under the steadfast gaze of an enlightened soul.
Sure, it will be a bumpy ride! So oil your springs.. stay steadfast in
truth. Be the being you are. Be ever ready. Tend to your fire, and do not
shirk from boldly confronting all who aim to kill the spirit.
For it is through our actions that the future we
want will be realized.
