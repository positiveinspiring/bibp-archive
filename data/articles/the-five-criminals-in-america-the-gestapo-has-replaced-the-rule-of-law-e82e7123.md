published a photo of
5
presidential appointees lying through their teeth to Congress.
All five of these Gestapo wannabes are in violation of their oath of
office to protect the Constitution of the United States. They have
relentlessly violated the Constitution, which makes these five, who are in
charge of US intelligence and black operations, traitors to the United
States.
Yet, they have not been arrested and put on
trial.
Congress is content to sit there and listen to
their ongoing lies time after time after time, despite the fact that these 5
have committed more and worse crimes against our country than the
"terrorists" that serve as an excuse for the crimes committed by the
intelligence agencies.
Remember, it is a crime for you to lie to any federal agent even if
you are not under oath or before Congress.
James Clapper, who has the grand title of
Director Of National Intelligence, is an admitted liar to the US
Congress but nevertheless remains in office.
That Clapper is still in office is a good
measure of the decline both in the integrity of the US government
and in the integrity that Congress, media, and the public expect from the
government.
President Nixon was driven from office
for a very small thing: Nixon lied about when he learned about a burglary
with which he had nothing to do.
Clapper brazenly lied to the US Congress,
denying that he was spying on members of the US Congress. Clapper is not
only in violation of the Constitution, he has committed a felony, especially
under the stretched interpretation of laws that is the norm for Department
of Justice prosecutions.
Huge numbers of Americans are in prison for
offenses that are molehills compared to Clappers, or for that matter, any
of the other five sitting there lying to Congress.
The Five Criminals told Congress that
Edward Snowden, who is under the
protection of the Russian government, must be made to give back the evidence
of NSA spying on the entire world before some US troops or diplomats are
killed by terrorists in some future war started by Washington, which
routinely dismisses the victims of its war crimes as "collateral damage."
None of the Five Criminals were able to specify how Congress could
make the Russian government hand over Snowden.
Rabid Republican warmongers have falsely and
propagandistically accused Snowden of being "a Russian spy." What utter
dishonesty!
The only reason Snowden is in Russia is that the
US, in violation of international law, refuses to allow an airplane to fly
from Russia with Snowden to any of the South American countries that have
granted Snowden asylum. The fact that Snowden is in Russia is entirely the
fault of Washington.
As I have written and said on many occasions, facts mean nothing to
Washington, to
the presstitute media, and to most of the
American population, who prefer comforting lies to reality.
No one in the American media or most Internet sites will dare tell you that
the reason the Five Criminals are again lying to Congress is to
deflect Congress and an insouciant public and media from the fact that they
have violated the law and their oath of office, and that the only purpose of
invoking "national security" is to protect the criminal actions of the
security agencies from being discovered.
"National Security" is the blanket under which
the crimes of government are hidden.
All that "national security" means is that,
"we are not going to let anyone
find out that we are nothing but a gang of criminal thugs, and we are going
to use the cover of national security to demonize Snowden who told on us."
The so-called "security agencies" and their media whores have created a
wartime atmosphere of fear as if the "worlds only superpower" was about to
be destroyed by a handful of lightly armed fighters thousands of miles away
who resist Washingtons invasions of their countries in corners of the earth
that most Americans cannot find on a map.
What kind of superpower is so terrified by
peoples that the superpower chooses to invade and murder? If the wronged
people are so threatening, the superpower should stay at home and leave them
alone.
Listen to this bullshit from Clapper:
As a consequence of Snowden, "the nation is
less safe and its people less secure."
The truth is the opposite of what Clapper
states.
Snowden alerted us to the fact that Clapper was
shredding the US Constitution that is our greatest protection. Clapper, who
should be in the dock for treason, has stolen our rights and our shield
against harm and abuse from arbitrary government power. Clapper is an enemy
of every American.
Listen to this bullshit from Lt. Gen, Michael Flynn, director of the
US Defense Intelligence Agency, who stupidly asserts that Snowdens
revelations of illegal mass spying on the US citizens and the world caused
"grave damage" to "national security."
What the general means is that it caused damage to his reputation and
brought him some cause for anxiety by revealing that he was engaged in
criminal activity.
But the general knew how to invoke the sympathy
and support of the right-wing superpatriots.
He declared that the greatest cost of Snowdens
revelations is,
"the cost of human lives on tomorrows
battlefield or in some place where we will put our military forces when
we ask them to go into harms way."
He is, of course, talking about the next time
that Washington criminally attacks another country in total violation of the
Nuremberg standard.
Senator Barbara Mikulski listening to this bullshit said that what
was needed was a Supreme Court ruling,
"to determine the constitutionality of these
programs."
Was this sincere or a cop-out? Why is Mikulski
passing the buck? The current Republican Supreme Court is corrupt and will
not defend the Constitution.
One of the leading Republican lights, as dimly
lit as he is, Justice Antonin Scalia, truthfully said that
concentration camps are a likely future reality for Americans and that the
Supreme Court would not do anything about the tyranny should the executive
branch think it necessary.
Senator Ron Wyden told the Five Criminals,
"I dont think this culture of
misinformation [that the Five Criminals represent] is going to be easily
fixed."
Nothing will be fixed until the Five
Criminals are arrested and put on trial for treason and until Congress
defunds the illegal wars and states firmly, backed up with the threat of
impeachment, that there is no such thing as "the unitary executive" who is
above law, Constitution, Congress, and the federal courts.
The Supreme Court will not protect us. Congress
must put the executive branch on notice that it is not above the law and the
Constitution. Americans have lost the rule of law.
Unless Congress quickly restores it, the country
is lost...
