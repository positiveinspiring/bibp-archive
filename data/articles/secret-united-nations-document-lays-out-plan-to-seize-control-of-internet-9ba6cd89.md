# Secret United Nations Document Lays Out Plan to Seize Control of Internet

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_internet132.htm

A report by a
United Nations organization calls for the international
body to seize control of information shared over the Internet should
the governments of member nations fail to pass sufficient cybersecurity
regulations.
In the document, called Trends
in Telecommunication Reform - Smart Regulation in a Broadband World,
the UNs
International Telecommunications Union (ITU) points to the specter
of an attack on the cyber infrastructure of a country as justification
for the world bodys assumption of regulation and monitoring of traffic
on the information superhighway.
That frightening prospect was first reported
by the
News Limited Network out of Australia.
Paola Totaro and Claire Connelly
write:
A draft of the proposal, formulated in
secret and only recently posted on the ITU website for public perusal,
reveal that if accepted, the changes would allow government restriction
or blocking of information disseminated via the internet and create a
global regime of monitoring internet communications - including the
demand that those who send and receive information identify themselves.
Their summary is accurate.
Citing,
the increased use of online
applications and services to communicate and do business (such as
social media, cloud services, e-payment and other m-banking
services), the ITU proposal calls on stakeholders (read:
countries that are members of the United Nations),
...to increase their regulatory control over
the Internet lest the threats to cybersecurity become an unmanageable
problem.
In what likely comes as no surprise to those
familiar with the UNs policy of consolidating power through the
eradication of national sovereignty, the ITU draft proposal would grant
the government of any member nation the right to throw the "kill switch"
on the Internet should that government suspect that information being
exchanged threatens their own or a fellow participating countrys
national security.
Although the document admits that when it
comes to policing the Internet,
the principles of privatization,
competition, and liberalization have been of central importance over
the past two decades, the time has now come, the UN body insists,
for government to assume greater responsibilities over the flow of
information through the Internet.
Thankfully, a coalition of civil rights
groups, labor unions, and large cybercorporations have come together to
oppose the UNs plan to police the Internet.
As
reported by Common Dreams, this coalition,
opposes the plan by some telecommunications
companies and countries including China and Saudi Arabia.
If approved, it would allow the UN's
International Telecommunications Union to charge users for services such
as email and restrict access to the internet and monitor activity
online.
The International Trades Union Conference,
representing 6.2 million union members in Britain,
wrote that the proposal could "restrict political freedoms and harm
civil society." Such changes would hit users from developing countries
particularly hard, according to the ITUC.
The website for
Stop the Net
Grab warns:
The internet as we know it is at risk.
Unless we act now, our right to freely communicate and share information
could change forever.
In less than four weeks time, the
International Telecommunications Union (or ITU), a United Nations
agency, is planning to adopt new rules to clamp down on the fundamental
freedoms of citizens online.
And:
So far the proposal has flown under the
radar, but its implications are so serious that we must act quickly to
show the ITU and its member countries that citizens will not stand by
while our right to communicate freely is undermined.
Chris Disspain, CEO of auDA,
told ITWire that a drive to consolidate power is behind the UNs net
grab.
He also said that,
"for some countries it is about a belief
that they can control things more easily if they go through the UN."
Later in the ITWire piece, it is reported
that Greenpeace and the ITUC sent a letter to UN Secretary General
Ban Ki-moon to,
"express their 'deep concern about a
potentially very damaging change to the governance of the
Internet.'
As for the reaction from Congress, Common
Dreams reports:
At a hearing last May of a U.S. House Energy
& Commerce Subcommittee, Republicans and Democrats were united in their
opposition to any move by Russia and China to transfer control of the
Internet to the U.N.,
according to Steve Elwart of the Koinonia Institute, a subject
matter expert for the Department of Homeland Security.
President Obama, as The New
American has reported, isnt willing to wait on Congress to pass
any measure addressing the alleged precarious state of U.S.
cybersecurity.
Promises of the White Houses imminent
issuing of the edict have been coming for months.
The Associated Press (AP)
obtained a leaked draft version of the
order, but indicated that the source of the document didnt disclose
when the president would sign the order.
Greater evidence of the imminent issuing of
the order came on September 19, when Department of Homeland Security
Secretary Janet Napolitano said the executive order granting
the president sweeping power over the Internet is close to completion.
In testimony before the Senate
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Napolitano said
that the order is still being drafted and vetted by various high-level
bureaucrats. But she also indicated that it would be issued as soon as a
few issues were resolved.
Assuming control of the nations Internet
infrastructure is a DHS responsibility, Napolitano added.
DHS is the Federal governments lead
agency for securing civilian government computer systems and works
with our industry and Federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial
government partners to secure critical infrastructure and
information systems, she informed senators.
Napolitanos report on the role of DHS
squares with the information revealed in the seven-page version of the
order the AP has read.
According to the report of their findings:
The draft order would put the Department of
Homeland Security in charge of organizing an information-sharing network
that rapidly distributes sanitized summaries of top-secret intelligence
reports about known cyber-threats that identify a specific target.
With these warnings, known as tear lines,
the owners and operators of essential U.S. businesses would be better
able to block potential attackers from gaining access to their computer
systems.
The new draft, which is not dated, retains a
section that requires Homeland Security to identify the vital systems
that, if hit by cyberattack, could "reasonably result in a debilitating
impact" on national and economic security.
Other sections establish a program to
encourage companies to adopt voluntary security standards and direct
federal agencies to determine whether existing cyber security
regulations are adequate.
The presidents de facto re-routing of all
Internet traffic through federal intelligence officers deputizes more
than just DHS as cybertraffic cops. The AP reports that the Pentagon,
the
National Security Agency (NSA), the director of national
intelligence, and the Justice Department will all cooperate in the
surveillance - in the name of national security, of course.
Evidence of President Obamas impatience was
found Thursday in
a story published by the Washington Post that reported,
President Obama has signed a secret
directive that effectively enables the military to act more
aggressively to thwart cyberattacks on the nations web of
government and private computer networks.
Although unpublished as of press time, that
directive, Presidential Policy Directive 20, reportedly,
lays out a process to vet any
operations outside government and defense networks and ensure that
U.S. citizens and foreign allies data and privacy are protected
and international laws of war are followed.
The citing of international law as
authority for such an unconstitutional exercise of authority is nothing
new.
As has happened so frequently during
the
Obama administration, government - national and
international - demands that liberty be sacrificed on the altar of
national security.
As for execution of the UN's plan, the
193-member ITU will
meet December 3-14, 2012 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
Draft Order Would Give Companies...
Cyber-Threat Info

WASHINGTON (AP)
A new White House executive order would
direct U.S. spy agencies to share the latest intelligence about
cyberthreats with companies operating electric grids, water plants,
railroads and other vital industries to help protect them from
electronic attacks, according to a copy obtained by The Associated
Press.
The seven-page draft order, which is being finalized, takes shape as the
Obama administration expresses growing concern that Iran could be the
first country to use cyberterrorism against the United States.
The military is ready to retaliate if the
U.S. is hit by cyberweapons, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said.
But the U.S. also is poorly prepared to prevent such an attack, which
could damage or knock out critical services that are part of everyday
life.
The White House declined to say when the president will sign the order.
The draft order would put the Department of Homeland Security in charge
of organizing an information-sharing network that rapidly distributes
sanitized summaries of top-secret intelligence reports about known
cyberthreats that identify a specific target.
With these warnings, known as tear lines,
the owners and operators of essential U.S. businesses would be better
able to block potential attackers from gaining access to their computer
systems.
An organized, broad-based approach for sharing cyberthreat information
gathered by the government is widely viewed as essential for any plan to
protect U.S. computer networks from foreign nations, terrorist groups
and hackers. Existing efforts to exchange information are narrowly
focused on specific industries, such as the finance sector, and have had
varying degrees of success.
Yet the order has generated stiff opposition from Republicans on Capitol
Hill who view it as a unilateral move that bypasses the legislative
authority held by Congress.
Administration officials said the order became necessary after Congress
failed this summer to pass cybersecurity legislation, leaving critical
infrastructure companies vulnerable to a serious and growing threat.
Conflicting bills passed separately by the
House and Senate included information-sharing provisions.
But efforts to get a final measure through
both chambers collapsed over the GOP's concerns that the Senate bill
would expand the federal government's regulatory power and increase
costs for businesses.
The White House has acknowledged that an order from the president, while
legally binding, is not enough. Legislation is needed to make other
changes to improve the country's digital defenses. An executive order,
for example, cannot offer a company protection from liabilities that
might result from a cyberattack on its systems.
The addition of the information-sharing provisions is the most
significant change to an earlier draft of the order completed in late
August.
The new draft, which is not dated, retains a
section that requires Homeland Security to identify the vital systems
that, if hit by cyberattack, could "reasonably result in a debilitating
impact" on national and economic security. Other sections establish a
program to encourage companies to adopt voluntary security standards and
direct federal agencies to determine whether existing cyber security
regulations are adequate.
The draft order directs the department to work with the Pentagon, the
National Security Agency, the director of national intelligence and the
Justice Department to quickly establish the information-sharing
mechanism.
Selected employees at critical
infrastructure companies would receive security clearances allowing them
to receive the information, according to the document. Federal agencies
would be required to assess whether the order raises any privacy or
civil liberties risks.
To foster a two-way exchange of information, the government would ask
businesses to tell the government about cyberthreats or cyberattacks.
There would be no requirement to do so.
The NSA
has been sharing cyberthreat information on a limited basis with
companies that conduct business with the Defense Department. These
companies work with sensitive data about weapon systems and technologies
and are frequently the targets of cyberspying.
But the loss of valuable information has been eclipsed by fears that an
enemy with the proper know-how could cause havoc by sending the
computers controlling critical infrastructure systems incorrect commands
or infecting them with malicious software.
Potential nightmare scenarios include
high-speed trains being put on collision courses, blackouts that last
days or perhaps even weeks or chemical plants that inadvertently release
deadly gases.
Panetta underscored the looming dangers during a speech last week in New
York by pointing to
the Shamoon virus that destroyed
thousands of computer systems owned by Persian Gulf oil and gas
companies. Shamoon, which spreads quickly through networked computers
and ultimately wipes out files by overwriting them, hit the Saudi
Arabian state oil company Aramco and Qatari natural gas producer RasGas.
Panetta did not directly connect Iran to the Aramco and RasGas attacks.
But U.S. officials believe hackers based in
Iran were behind them.
Shamoon replaced files at Aramco with
the image of a burning U.S. flag and rendered more than 30,000
computers useless, Panetta said.
The attack on RasGas was similar, he said.
A spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Caitlin Hayden,
said the administration is consulting with members of Congress and the
private sector as the order is being drafted.
But she provided no information on when an
order would be signed.
"Given the gravity of the threats we
face in cyberspace, we want to get this right in addition to getting
it done swiftly," she said.
