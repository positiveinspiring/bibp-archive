# Putin Tired of 'Russian Hack Lies' Sends a Message Directly to the 
American People

Ever since
Hillary Clinton lost
the
2016 U.S. presidential election, we have seen some very
interesting things happen.
From sheer panic to claims of
Russian hacks to blaming
'fake news'
(below video),
everything under the sun has been pulled out to blame someone or
something for why she lost...
CNN Goes Nuts
....Over Russians and Fake News, Claim Trump Lost Election
The two apparent reasons that have
seemed to raise to the surface the most, and the mainstream seems to
be running with, are the idea that Russia hacked
the DNC and caused
the problem and that the spread of fake news got people so
disinterested in Hillary that they voted for Trump.
We covered this years election
cycle a lot and have discussed the DNC hack, Hillary's campaign
intentionally knocking out Sanders and more.
Off the top, it could be easy to see how
Russia would perform a hack of the DNC if you believe the propaganda
coming from
mainstream U.S. news, but upon closer look and by
listening to more than one worldly news outlet like,
...you will begin to hear a different story.
Once these claims began floating around,
we reached out to various high level contacts that might be able to
help u s get to the bottom of what was really going on here.
-
How did
Trump actually win?
-
Who was providing WikiLeaks with all of the
information?
-
The elite is clearly panicking, but what are they going
to do next?
From those sources, who we can't name at
the moment for obvious reasons but are connected to individuals
inside the FBI and CIA, we've heard that the leaks came from the
inside.
They came from people who were tired of
having to play the elite and cabals game for so long and watching as
it negatively began to affect their own country and life.
In essence, these people,
like Snowden,
had seen enough and were fed up with the constant lies, cover up and
manipulation of people, so they decided to do something about it...
Strong Evidence?
There is also something to be said about
how
weak the evidence is that Putin/Russia had anything to do with a
hack, and the fact that the entire focus is on a hack versus someone
simply handing over documents they would have had access to i.e.
inside people, is quite telling.
The way I see it, if the evidence was so
strong, there wouldn't be as much of an argument or debate.
It's one
thing to have some level of disagreement, but Russia's involvement
is so speculative and yet such a powerful U.S. propaganda tool that
you almost have to question the legitimacy of it.
Judging from the following statement put
forth by Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it seems they've
grown tired of the U.S.' push to blame Russia. This public statement
addresses the issue quite clearly and is one the American people
should note when questioning what is
really going on in this Putin/hacker story.
This
message has been directly copied off a section of Russia's Foreign
Policy on their government website. Of course, take this for
whatever resonates with you, that is the key here!
But
alternate perspectives are important.
"Frankly speaking, we are tired of lies about Russian hackers
that continue to be spread in the United States from the very
top.
The
Obama
administration
launched this misinformation half a year ago in a bid to play up
to the required nominee at the November presidential election
and, having failed to achieve the desired effect, has been
trying to justify its failure by taking it out with a vengeance
on Russian-U.S. relations.
However, the truth about the White House-orchestrated
provocation is bound to surface sooner or later. In fact, this
is already happening.
On
December 8, U.S. media quoted Georgia's Secretary of State
Brian Kemp as
saying that the local authorities tracked down the origin of a
hacker attack on his voter registration database after the
election.
The
attack was traced to an IP address of the Department of
Homeland Security.
This was followed by an attempt to quickly cover up this
information by a flood of new anti-Russian accusations that did
not contain a single piece of evidence.
We can only add that if Washington takes new
hostile steps, it will receive an answer.
This applies to any actions against Russian
diplomatic missions in the United States, which will immediately
backfire at U.S. diplomats in Russia.
The Obama administration probably does not care
at all about the future of bilateral relations, but history will
hardly forgive it for this apr√®s-nous-le-deluge attitude."

What To Do With This
Information
As stated many times on our news
platform, we take an approach of informing, creating a shift in
perspective and then inspiring action from that new perspective.
By seeing the world's happenings through
different perspectives and fresh eyes, we can begin to
shift our
consciousness and ultimately create a world that better reflects
what people want versus what their governments/the elite are
creating.
Again, we help to shed light on how
things truly function, as oppose to the illusory story mainstream
news and media project.
The more we understand how our world
really functions, the more we can begin to see through the lies and
manipulation being used to control us and keep us down. This isn't
about us versus them and having to fight back, it's about KNOWING.
When you become aware you begin to see
the world very differently and ultimately you make different
choices.
You no longer just follow along your
daily actions robotically, you get in touch more with YOU and your
own stream of thought.
