# TRUE DEMOCRACY SUMMER 2001

Haystack (Buttes) USAF Laboratory,
Edwards AFB, CA
A 30 levels deep, extreme security facility reportedly engaged in alien
technology retro-engineering.
Retro-engineering is defined as analysis of existing components or assemblies
normally but this description is centered on "aliens" so could it be that
this definition of retro-engineering pertains to human beings?
Many people claim that they see UFOs while the military denies them catagorically.
I suspect that the military is deceiving us.
If we discontinue the funding of this aspect of Edwards AFB, then we should
obtain the truth. Moreover, when, not if, we do what President Kennedy wanted
to do, then we will find out a multitude of information.
