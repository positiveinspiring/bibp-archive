The desperate and cornered
Federal Reserve Board crime family
attacked Haiti with an earthquake weapon and then invaded it in
order to seize the Haitian central bank.
By seizing the central bank the Feds got access
to codes for the new financial system and tried to launder the fraudulently
obtained dollars and
drug money via the nearby Dominican
Republic. This is why the announcement of a new financial system we were
promised would take place on January 19th has been delayed.
As the end of the Fed approaches desperate
battle lines are being drawn by the cornered rats.
The Bush-Clinton family is planning to replace
Obama
with Hillary Clinton, forcing Vice President Biden and Nancy Pelosi
to step aside (this information was obtained by our own sources
independently of Christopher Story. We earlier reported the initial plan
called for President Pelosi and VP Hillary).
Kenyan born Obama has to prove his US citizenship to a judge on January 26th.
The judge is an ex-marine who has the backing of the US military and he is
not going to submit to pressure. That is why the Bush/Nazi faction was
Hillary. Another group wants to set up an emergency government to oversee
new elections and return the US to constitutional rule.
There is a big accounting date on January 30th and it is not
clear how the Feds intend to make it past that date. We need to be on
extreme alert as we are dealing with desperate, cornered gangsters.
Meanwhile the Black Dragon Society *
has decided not to wait for the financial war raging in the Western world to
end and has started building factories in Asia to develop heretofore
forbidden technology.
* The Kokuryukai - 黒龍会, has
complained about our use of their name in Japanese. Since there is no point
for groups with similar philosophies to quarrel over a name, we will refer
to our group was the BDS or Black Dragon Society both in Japanese and
English.
There have also been complaints about
or referral to the Emperor visiting Washington because many Japanese right
wingers refuse to believe such a thing would be allowed. Our source for this
information was Casper who claims to have dealt directly with him.
There is a lot of disinformation and
misinformation out there so, ultimately readers will have to judge the truth
for themselves.
