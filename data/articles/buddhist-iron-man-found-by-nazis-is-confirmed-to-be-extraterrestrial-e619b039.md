# Buddhist 'Iron Man' Found by Nazis is Confirmed to Be Extraterrestrial

Remember how in Raiders of the Lost
Ark the Nazis send that creepy Toht fellow to Nepal to track
down the headpiece of the Staff of Ra so they can find the Ark of
the Covenant and use it to unleash Gods face-melting wrath on their
enemies in battle?
Change Nepal to Tibet, Toht to zoologist
and SS officer
Ernst Schäfer, the Ark of the Covenant to the
roots of the Aryan race, and the Staff of Ra to an
iron statue of a Buddhist deity and it all really happened
(okay, not the face-melting...)
In 1938, Himmler sent Schäfer on
an expedition to Tibet to trace the purported roots of the Aryan
race.
Schäfer himself, being an actual
scientist instead of a mysticism-obsessed ignoramus like Himmler,
was not keen on this plan. His goal was to document the geology,
climate, flora, fauna and inhabitants of the region, but he had
joined the SS in 1933, ostensibly just to be allowed to keep on
working, so by 1938 he was well-versed in dirty Nazi compromise.
Between May of 1938 and August of 1939,
Schäfers team traveled from the Indian Himalayan state of Sikkim to
Lhasa to the Yarlung River Valley in western Tibet.
They took tens of thousands of pictures,
collected dozens of animal specimens, thousands of seeds, head casts
and head measurements of hundreds of locals, a Tibetan mastiff and
one iron statue of a deity with a swastika on his breastplate.
The swastika is of course an
ancient symbol of the sun and good fortune, first appearing in the
Indus Valley civilization about 3500 years ago.
It came to religious prominence in the
Far East with the spread of Buddhism but also appears in
pre-Buddhist traditions like the early
Bön religion of western Tibet,
which included the swastika in its iconography in the 8th
and 9th centuries.
Since Aryanist theology held that the
master race had conquered Asia after they fled the
destruction of
Atlantis (yeah, I know...), Schäfer could well have thought this
curious artifact would satisfy Himmler, who was very much into
Hinduism and Buddhism and thought the Buddha himself might be the
Aryan descendant of the post-Atlantis Nordic master race.
After Schäfers team returned to Munich,
the iron statue dropped out of sight.
It wasnt until 2007 that its anonymous
new owner reached out to a team of scientists led by Dr. Elmar
Buchner from the Institute of Planetology at the University of
Stuttgart to see if they could find out more about it. He only let
them test the figure in a very limited way, however.
They werent allowed to take any
significant samples; they could only literally scrape the surface in
an attempt to determine what the statue was made of.
In 2009, the Iron Man, as he became
known, was sold at auction. Since then, it has been in the hands of
one of Buchners team and they have had full access to do whatever
tests they wish on it.
The statue weighs about 23 pounds and is
about 10 inches tall and 5 inches wide.
Its hard to determine exactly who it
depicts, but Buchner thinks its a Bön culture artifact from the 11th
century portraying a version of the Buddhist deity
Vaiśravana, known in Tibet as
Jambhala. He is the god of fortune and wealth (which would be in
keeping with the swastika), or sometimes a god of war (which would
be in keeping with the armor hes wearing).
There are things missing, though;
iconography and attributes you see in later depictions of Vaisravana
are not present here. Some, like a flaming trident he holds in the
crook of his left arm, could have been lost over the centuries.
Buchners working theory is that the
statue is a transitional figure that incorporates both pre-Buddhist
and Buddhist elements, which is why its non-standard in some ways.
The most unusual part of it is not the
iconography, but rather its composition.
Buchner knew from the moment their eyes
met across a crowded lab that Iron Mans iron came from a meteorite.
He could tell from thumb-like impressions left on the surface when
the meteorite melted during its crash landing.
Geochemical analyses confirmed that the
Iron Mans iron wasnt just from a meteorite, but from the rarest of
them all: an
ataxite.
The high levels of nickel and cobalt in
the iron marked it as an ataxite class meteorite. Less than 1% of
iron meteorites and less than .1% of all meteorites are ataxites.
Even more exceptionally, the researchers
were able to pin down exactly which meteorite it had been carved out
of.
The geochemical data match those of the
Chinga meteorite which fell to
earth between Mongolia and Siberia about 15,000 years ago. The first
reports of its discovery were made in 1913, but someone found a
piece a lot earlier than that, almost a thousand years earlier than
that, in fact.
The carver had to have known it was
special because chiseling this kind of iron is a tough, tough job.
Perhaps he had an inkling it came from
the sky - theres a long history of meteorites being treated with
religious reverence in many cultures - or perhaps he just thought it
was so unique it was perfect for depicting a god.
After the carving, the figure was forged
around the edges and base, and then gilded. Only traces of the
gilding remain today.
Other meteorites that have been held to
be holy were worshipped in rock form. Objects like knives and
jewelry have been found carved from meteorites, as have animal
figures like eagles.
There are references in the historical
record to the Tibetan craft of carving sky iron, but that craft
has long since died out and none of the references mention the
carving of humans or anthropomorphic deities.
As far as we know, this statue is the
only depiction of a human figure carved into a meteorite thats ever
been found.
