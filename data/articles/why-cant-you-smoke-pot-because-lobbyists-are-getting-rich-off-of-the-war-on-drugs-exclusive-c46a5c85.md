Police union lobbyist
John Lovell
John Lovell is
a lobbyist who makes a
lot of money from making sure you cant smoke a joint.
Thats his job. Hes a lobbyist for the police
unions in Sacramento, and he is a driving force behind grabbing Federal
dollars to shut down the California marijuana industry. Ill get to the
evidence on this important story in a bit, but first, some context.
At some point in the distant past, the war on drugs might have been popular.
But not anymore - the
polling is clear, but beyond that, the
last three Presidents have used illegal
drugs.
So why do we still put hundreds of
thousands of people in steel cages for
pot-related offenses? Well, there are many reasons, but one of them is, of
course, money in politics. Corruption.
Whatever you want to call it, its why you cant
smoke a joint without committing a crime, though of course you can ingest
any number of pills or drinks completely within the law.
Some of the groups who want to keep the drug illegal are police unions that
want more members to pay more dues. One of the primary sources for cash for
more policing activities are Federal grants for penalizing illegal drug use,
which help pay for overtime, additional police officers, and equipment for
the force.
Thats what Lovell does, he gets those grants.
He also fights against democratic mechanisms to legalize drugs.
In 2010, California considered Prop 19, a measure to legalize marijuana and
tax it as alcohol. The proposition gained more votes than Meg Whitman,
the former eBay executive and Republican gubernatorial nominee that year,
but failed to pass.
Opponents of the initiative
ran ads,
organized rallies, and spread conspiracy
theories about billionaire George Soros to confuse voters.
Lovell managed the opposition campaign against Prop 19.
He
told Time Magazine that he was pushing
against the initiative because,
the last thing we need is yet another
mind-altering substance to be legalized.
But Republic Report reviewed lobbying contracts
during the Prop 19 fight, and
found that Lovells firm was paid over
$386,350 from a wide array of police unions, including the California Police
Chiefs Association.
While Lovell may contend that he sincerely opposes the idea of marijuana
legalization, he has constructed an entire business model predicated on pot
prohibition.
Shortly after President Obamas stimulus program passed, Lovell went to work
channeling the taxpayer money for California into drug war programs.
According to documents Republic Report
obtained from the Police Chiefs
Association, Lovell helped local departments apply for drug war money from
the Federal government.
Heres a copy of
one letter sent to a police department in
Lassen County, California:
There is big money in marijuana prohibition.
Lovell represented a police union in a
bid to steer some
$2.2 million dollars into a Marijuana Suppression
Program.
In 2009 and 2010, California police
unions sought a
$7,537,389 chunk of Federal money for
police to conduct a Campaign Against Marijuana Planting program.
The anti-marijuana money went directly into the paychecks of many officers.
For example, police departments in Shasta, Siskiyou, and Tehama Counties
formed a North California Eradication Team to
receive $550,000 in grants that helped pay
for overtime, a new officer, and flight operations:
The total amount awarded was $550,000, to be
split between Shasta, Siskiyou and Tehama counties, which make up the
Northern California Marijuana Eradication Team (NorCal-MET).
Broken down in the agenda worksheet, the
sheriffs office is expecting to spend $20,000 on flight operations,
$94,895 for the full-time deputys salary and benefits, $16,788 for the
administration assistant salary and benefits and $29,983 to cover up to
666.29 hours of overtime.
The Federal anti-marijuana "honey-pot" might have
dried up if Prop 19 had passed. Legalizing marijuana would have generated
billions in tax revenue for the state of California, while also reducing
victimless crime prosecutions.
But for lobbyists like Lovell, legalization was
a direct assault on hundreds of thousands of dollars in potential fees for
helping to solicit taxpayer money for his clients.
Police unions also
contributed about $100,500 to a campaign
account used to coordinate opposition to Prop 19.
Of the $386,350 in fees paid by police unions to
Lovell through 2009 and 2010, status update reports reviewed by Republic
Report reveal that Lovell worked on a number of issues, from advocacy
against Prop 19 to channeling grants and monitoring legislation.
Of course, police unions arent the only interest group with a stake in
maintaining broken drug laws. The
beer industry,
alcohol corporations, and prison guard
unions also contributed money to help Lovell stop Prop 19.
Howard Wooldridge, a retired police officer who
now helps push for legalization as a citizen advocate,
told Republic Report that
drug company
lobbyists also fight to keep marijuana illegal because they view pot as a
low-cost form of competition.
