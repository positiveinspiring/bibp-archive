# Putin is Defeating More than ISIS in Syria

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_russia51.htm

Russia and its President, Vladimir Putin, a little more than a
year ago, in July 2014 were the focus of attention in Europe and
North America, accused, without a shred of forensic evidence, of
shooting down an unarmed civilian Malaysian airliner over
eastern Ukraine.
The
Russians were deemed out to restore the Soviet Union with their
agreement to the popular referendum of Crimean citizens to annex
into the Russian Federation and not Ukraine. Western sanctions
were being thrown at Russia by both Washington and the EU.
People spoke of a new Cold War.
Today the picture is changing, and
profoundly.
It
is Washington that is on the defensive, exposed for the criminal
actions it has been doing in Syria and across the Middle East,
including creating the recent asylum crisis in Germany and large
parts of the EU.
As a student of international
politics and economics for most of my adult life, I must say the
emotional restraint that
Vladimir Putin and the
Russian government have shown against tasteless ad hominem
attacks, from people such as
Hillary Clinton who
likened Putin to Adolf Hitler, is remarkable.
But more than restraint is required
to bring our world from the brink or some might say, the onset
of a World War III. Brilliant and directed action is essential.
Here something extraordinary has
taken place in the very few days since President Vladimir
Putin's
September 28, UNGA speech in
New York.
What he
said
What Putin said to the UN General
Assembly must be noted to put what he and Russia did in the days
immediately following into clear focus.
First of all he made clear what the
international law behind the UN Charter means and that Russia is
scrupulously abiding by the Charter in actions in Syria. Russia,
unlike the US, has been formally asked by the legitimate Syrian
government to aid its war against terror.
To the UN delegates and heads of
state Putin stated,
"The
decisions debated within the UN are either taken in the form
of resolutions or not.
As diplomats say, they either pass or they
don't. Any action taken by circumventing this procedure is
illegitimate and constitutes a violation of the UN Charter
and contemporary international
law."
He continued,
"We all know that after the end of the Cold
War the world was left with one center of dominance, and
those who found themselves at the top of the pyramid were
tempted to think that, since they are so powerful and
exceptional, they know best what needs to be done and thus
they don't need to reckon with the UN, which, instead of
rubber-stamping the decisions they need, often stands in
their
way."
Putin followed this with a clear
message to Washington and NATO governments on the subject of
national sovereignty, something anathema to many who embrace the
Nirvana supposed to come from globalization, homogenization of
all to one level:
"What
is the meaning of state sovereignty, the term which has been
mentioned by our colleagues here?" Putin rhetorically
asked.
"It basically means freedom, every person and every state
being free to choose their future. By the way, this brings
us to the issue of the so-called legitimacy of state
authorities. You shouldn't play with words and manipulate
them.
In international law, international affairs, every
term has to be clearly defined, transparent and interpreted
the same way by one and
all."
Putin added,
"We are all different, and we should respect
that. Nations shouldn't be forced to all conform to the same
development model that somebody has declared the only
appropriate one.
We should all remember the lessons of the
past.
For example, we remember examples from our Soviet
past, when the Soviet Union exported social experiments,
pushing for changes in other countries for ideological
reasons, and this often led to tragic consequences and
caused degradation
instead of progress. "
Those few words succinctly point to
what is fundamentally wrong in the international order today.
Nations, above all the one
proclaiming herself Sole Superpower, Infallible Hegemon, the
USA, have arrogantly moved after the collapse of the main
adversary, the Soviet Union in 1990, to create what can only be
called a global totalitarian empire, what
G.H.W. Bush in
his September 11, 1991 address to Congress called a
New World
Order:
I believe with conviction that
borders do matter, that respect for different cultures,
different historical experiences is essential in a world of
peace.
That is as much true with nations as with individual
human beings. We seem to have forgotten that simple notion amid
all the wars of the past decades. Vladimir Putin reminds us.
Then the Russian president goes to
the heart of the matter.
He lays bare the true activities of
the Obama Administration in Syria and the Middle East in arming and
training "moderate" Islamist terrorists to attack Washington's
bÃªte noire, Syria's duly-elected and recently re-elected
President, Bashar al Assad.
Putin states,
"instead of learning from other people's mistakes, some
prefer to repeat them and continue to export revolutions,
only now these are "democratic" revolutions. Just look at
the situation in the Middle East and Northern
Africa
problems have been piling up for a long time in this
region, and people there wanted change.
But what was the
actual outcome?
Instead of bringing about reforms,
aggressive intervention rashly destroyed government
institutions and the local way of life. Instead of democracy
and progress, there is now violence, poverty, social
disasters and total disregard for human rights, including
even the right to
life."
Then in a remark addressed to
Washington and their NGO Color Revolutions known as the Arab
Spring, Putin pointedly asks,
"I'm urged to ask those who created this situation: do you
at least realize now what you've
done?"
Putin, without naming it, addresses
the US and NATO
role in creating ISIS, noting with precision the
curious anomaly that the sophisticated new US Treasury unit to
conduct financial sanctions against terrorist organizations, has
utterly ignored the funding sources of ISIS, their oil sales
facilitated by the Turkish President's own family to name just
one.
The Russian President stated,
"
the Islamic State itself did
not come out of nowhere.
It was initially developed as a
weapon against undesirable secular regimes. Having
established control over parts of Syria and Iraq, Islamic
State now aggressively expands into other regions.
It seeks dominance in the Muslim
world and beyond
The situation is extremely
dangerous.
In these circumstances, it is hypocritical and
irresponsible to make declarations about the threat of terrorism
and at the same time turn a blind eye to the channels used to
finance and support terrorists, including revenues from drug
trafficking, the illegal oil trade and the arms
trade."
And what
Putin is doing
Russia in the last weeks has
completely out-maneuvered the diabolical, and they are
diabolical, agenda of the Obama Administration not only in Syria
but also
in the entire Middle East and now in the EU with
unleashing the flood of refugees.
He openly reached out to
invite Obama in their New York September 30 meeting to cooperate
together in defeating ISIS.
Obama stubbornly insisted that first
Assad must go, despite the fact that Christine Wormuth, the
Pentagon Undersecretary responsible for the Syrian war,
confirmed Russian statements about Assad's essential role today
in any defeat of ISIS.
She told the US Senate that Assad's
military,
"still
has considerable strength," adding, "it's
still the most powerful military force on the ground. The
assessment right now is the regime is not in imminent danger
of
falling."
Now come the howls of protest from
neo-con warhawks, like the ever-ready-for-war Senator John
McCain, chairman of the NGO International Republican
Institute of the democratic revolution exporting US-backed NGO,
National Endowment for Democracy. Or we hear flaccid protests from
President Obama.
This is because Washington finds itself deeply
exposed to the light of world scrutiny for backing terrorists in
Syria against a duly-elected state leader and government.
The US warhawks accuse Russia of
hitting "the moderate opposition" or civilians.
Emperor's
New Clothes
Russia's Putin is playing the role
ever so elegantly, even gracefully, of the small boy in the Hans
Christian Anderson classic fairy tale from 1837,
The Emperor's
New Clothes.
The boy stands with his mother amid
thousands of other villagers in the crowd outside the vain
Emperor's palace balcony, where the disassociated king struts
around the balcony naked, thinking he is wearing a magnificent
new suit of clothes.
The boy shouts, to the embarrassment
of all servile citizens who pretend his clothes are magnificent,
"Mother, look the Emperor has no clothes!"
What do I mean?
In the first four
days of precision bombing of select sites in Syria Russian
advanced fighter jets firing Kh-29L air-to-surface laser-guided
missiles that strike targets with a precision less than two
meters, managed to destroy key ISIS command centers, munitions
depots and vital infrastructure.
According to the Russian Defense
Ministry,
"official reports, with photos,
Su-34 bombers attacked an ISIS special training camp and
munition depot near Al-Tabqa, Ar-Raqqah province," a
critical ISIS outpost captured in August, 2014 after bitter
battles.
"As a result of explosion of the
munition depot, the terrorist training camp was completely
destroyed," the Russian Defense Ministry spokesman stated.
Russian Su-25 jets have also
attacked training camp of the Islamic State in the Syrian Idlib,
destroying a workshop for explosive belt
production.
Moscow states its air force has,
"engaged 3 munition, fuel and
armament depots of the illegal armed groups. KAB-500
aviation bombs detonated the munition and armament," and
they used BETAB-500 concrete-piercing bombs to destroy four
command posts of the ISIS armed groups.
"The facilities with terrorists
are completely destroyed," the Moscow spokesman added.
Russia's aviation conducted 20
flights and carried out 10 airstrikes against facilities of the
Islamic State (ISIL) terrorist group in the past 24 hours.
Then Moscow announced they had also
hit key outposts of other terror groups such as the Al
Qaeda-franchise, Al Nusra Front.
These are the so-called "moderates"
that McCain and the Washington warhawks are weeping over.
Washington has been creating what it calls the "New" Syrian
Forces (NSF), which they claim is composed of "moderate"
terrorists, euphemistically referred to as "rebels."
Imagine how recruitment talks go:
CIA recruiter:
"Mohammed, are you a moderate
Islamist? Why yes, my dear CIA trainer. Please take me,
train me and arm me in the fight against the ruthless
dictator Assad and against ISIS. I'm on your side. You can
trust me
"
In late September it was reported
that Major Anas Obaid a.k.a. Abu Zayd, on completing his CIA
training in Turkey, defected from the train-and-equip program to
join Jabhat al-Nusra (Al Qaeda in Syria) immediately on entering
Syria.
Incredibly, US officials admit that
Washington does not track or exercise command-and-control of its
Jihadist proxies once they enter Syria.
Abu Zayd's defection after being
trained in advanced warfare techniques by the US, is typical.
Other elements of the New Syrian Forces directly handed all
their weapons to Nusra upon entering Syrian territory at the
town of Atareb at the end of
September.
These latest "moderate" defections
to join Al Qaeda's Al-Nusra Front affiliate in Syria come less
than two weeks after Gen. Lloyd Austin III, head of the US "war
against ISIS," during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing
on Syria, admitted that the US military program that intended
produce 5,400 trained fighters a year has so far only resulted
in "four or five" who still remain on the ground and active in
combat.
The rest have all joined ISIS or Al
Nusra Front of Al Qaeda, the US-backed "moderate opposition" to
ISIL.
What the successful Russian
precision airstrikes have done is expose in all its ugly
nakedness the Emperor's New Clothes.
For more than one year, the Obama
Administration claims it has committed the most awesome airpower
on the planet allegedly to destroy ISIS, which has been
described as a,
"ragtag band of militants
running around the desert in basketball shoes."
Curiously, until last week,
ISIS has only expanded its web of power in Syria and Iraq under
US bombings.
Now, within 72 hours, the
Russian military, launching only 60 bombing runs in 72 hours,
hitting more than 50 ISIS targets, has brought the ISIS
combatants into what the Russian Defense Ministry spokesman
described as a state of "panic" where more than 600 have
deserted.
And, according to Moscow, the
fight is only beginning, expected, they say to last three to
four months.
The Obama Administration has been
training terrorists of Al Qaeda/Al Nusra, allegedly to fight
ISIS, much like the disgraced General David Petraeus did in Iraq
and Afghanistan along with Obama's special ISIS coordinator, the
just-resigned General John Allen.
The US-trained "moderate" terrorists
were being readied, it's now clear to all the world, in reality,
to battle Assad and open the way for
a Muslim Brotherhood
takeover of Syria and a real plunge into darkness for the world
if that were to succeed.
Now, with the truth in the open,
exposed by the remarkable successes of a handful of Russian
fighter jets in four days against ISIS, accomplishing more than
the US "anti-ISIS coalition" in more than one year, it is clear
to the world Washington has been playing a dirty double game.
Now that
hypocritical Obama
Administration mask has been blown off with the precision hit of
a Russian laser-guided Kh-29L missile.
As German and other EU governments
have admitted, much to the strong objection of Washington, Putin
has demonstrated that Russia is the essential part of any
peaceful resolution of
the Syria war. That in turn has a huge
bearing on the
current asylum-seeker crisis in Germany and other
parts of the EU.
It also has a huge bearing on
prospects for world peace.
The Norwegian Parliament's Nobel
'Peace' Prize Committee, rather than consider John Kerry,
might consider Vladimir Putin and Russian Defense
Minister, Sergey Shoygu, for the prize.
