# Alice Bailey & Djwhal Khul - The Externalization of the Hierarchy - II - The
New Group of World Servers

The new
group of world servers believes that (through the agency of goodwill) the new world order
can be firmly established on Earth. Today, in the interim period of the war, preparation
for reconstruction can go forward simultaneously with the effort to defeat the
totalitarian powers.
The men and women of goodwill must not be energized into activity with the note of
sacrifice. The war has exacted much of that from them. The clarion note of joy through
goodwill activity must be sent out. Let the beauty of what can be, the glory of the vision
and the spiritual, scientific and physical rebuilding of humanity be held before them,
inspiring them to renewed effort.
Through the work earlier done all over the world by the men of vision and of goodwill,
there exist today many thousands of people in Europe, America and elsewhere who are
waiting for the guidance which will start them into right activity. In every land the men
and women of goodwill are to be found, ready to respond to a clear call and intelligent
organization in the service of reconstruction. Let them be found.
The message to be taught prior to any future peace consists of the following three
clear and practical truths:
- That the errors and mistakes of past centuries, culminating in the present world war,
are the joint errors and mistakes of humanity as a whole. This recognition will lead to
the establishing of the principle of sharing, so needed in the world today.
- That there are no problems and conditions which cannot be solved by the will-to-good.
Goodwill nourishes the spirit of understanding and fosters the manifestation of the
principle of cooperation. This cooperative spirit is the secret of all right human
relations and the enemy of competition.
- That there is a blood relationship between men which, when recognized, dissolves all
barriers and ends the spirit of separativeness and hate. The peace and happiness of each
is the concern, therefore, of all. [207] This develops the Principle of responsibility and
lays the foundation of right corporate action.
These are the basic beliefs of the men and women of goodwill and provide the incentive
to all service and action. These three practical and scientific truths embody the three
basic facts and the initial acceptance of all world servers. They are contrary to no world
position, subversive of no government or religious attitude and are innate in the
consciousness of all men, evoking immediate response. Their acceptance will
"heal" international sores.
I call on all the men and women of goodwill in the world to study the principles of the
new world order. I call upon them, as they fight for justice and the rights of the little
nations and the future of the children of all nations, to begin to educate those whom they
can reach, in right attitudes and in that foresighted vision which will make the mistakes
of the past impossible in the future.
One basic divine attribute is not yet as strong as it should be in humanity - the
attribute of forgiveness. It is still associated with magnanimity. It is not seen to be
essentially a condition of future relation between all nations, based upon a recognition
of our common humanity. Germany, under her misguided and evil rulers, needs forgiveness.
All the great Powers have also sinned in some degree and all have grievously erred in the
past. Germany has precipitated the evil which has come upon the world, but she has within
herself the seeds of her own punishment; these seeds will not come to fruition if
excessive punishment is inflicted from outside.
Three recognitions will save the world when the guns cease firing:
- The recognition of joint responsibility for past world conditions. The truth that
"all have sinned" must be faced.
- The recognition that, though the German people weakly acquiesced in the rule of Hitler,
they are basically the victims of an organized deception. [208] Since 1914 they have been
told only lies. The future new world order will inaugurate an era of truthful propaganda
and national and international information.
- The recognition that the past has gone with all its evils, and that a future of
unlimited possibilities for good and for constructive changes lies ahead. The future must
be developed by all nations in the closest collaboration.
These three points must be constantly presented to the public in the simplest language,
because it is the inert mass of unthinking people who will constitute the hardest problem.
Appeal must be made to the best that is in them, because the immediate task ahead is the
development of those right attitudes without which no peace can be lasting and justice
will not be possible. Peace must not be imposed by those who hate war. Peace must
be a natural outcome and expression of the human spirit, and of a determination to change
the world attitude into one of right human relations.
