The investment arms of the CIA and Google are
both backing a company that monitors the web in real time - and says it uses
that information to predict the future.
The company is called
Recorded Future, and it scours tens of thousands of
websites, blogs and Twitter accounts to find the relationships between
people, organizations, actions and incidents - both present and
still-to-come.
In a white paper, the company says its temporal analytics
engine goes beyond search by,
looking at the invisible links between
documents that talk about the same, or related, entities and events.
The idea is to figure out for each incident who
was involved, where it happened and when it might go down.
Recorded Future then plots that chatter, showing
online momentum for any given event.
The cool thing is, you can actually predict
the curve, in many cases, says company CEO Christopher Ahlberg, a
former Swedish Army Ranger with a PhD in computer science.
Which naturally makes the 16-person Cambridge,
Massachusetts, firm attractive to Google Ventures, the search giants
investment division, and to
In-Q-Tel, which handles similar duties for the
CIA and the wider intelligence community.
Its not the very first time Google has done business with Americas spy
agencies. Long before it reportedly
enlisted the help of the National
Security Agency to secure its networks, Google
sold equipment to the secret
signals-intelligence group.
In-Q-Tel backed the mapping firm
Keyhole, which
was bought by Google in 2004 - and then became the backbone for Google
Earth.
This appears to be the first time, however, that the intelligence community
and Google have funded the same startup, at the same time. No one is
accusing Google of directly collaborating with the CIA.
But the investments
are bound to be fodder for critics of Google, who already see the search
giant as overly cozy with the U.S. government, and worry that the company is
starting to forget its dont be evil mantra.
Americas spy services have become increasingly interested in mining open
source intelligence - information thats publicly available, but often
hidden in the daily avalanche of TV shows, newspaper articles, blog posts,
online videos and radio reports.
Secret information isnt always the brass
ring in our profession, then CIA-director General
Michael Hayden told a
conference in 2008.
In fact, theres a real satisfaction in solving a
problem or answering a tough question with information that someone was
dumb enough to leave out in the open.
U.S. spy agencies, through In-Q-Tel, have
invested in a number of firms to help them better find that information.
Visible Technologies
crawls over half a million
web 2.0 sites a day, scraping more than a million posts and conversations
taking place on blogs, YouTube, Twitter and Amazon.
Attensity applies the
rules of grammar to the so-called unstructured text of the web to make it
more
easily digestible by government databases.
Keyhole (now Google Earth)
is a staple of the targeting cells in military-intelligence units. Recorded Future strips from web pages the people, places and activities they
mention.
The company examines when and where these events
happened (spatial and temporal analysis) and the tone of the document
(sentiment analysis). Then it applies some artificial-intelligence
algorithms to tease out connections between the players.
Recorded Future
maintains an index with more than 100 million events, hosted on Amazon.com
servers.
The analysis, however, is on the living web.
Were right there as it happens, Ahlberg
told Danger Room as he clicked through a demonstration. We can assemble
actual real-time dossiers on people.
Recorded Future certainly has the potential to
spot events and trends early.
Take the case of Hezbollahs long-range
missiles. On March 21, Israeli President Shimon Peres leveled the allegation
that the terror group had Scud-like weapons. Scouring Hezbollah leader
Hassan Nasrallahs past statements, Recorded Future found corroborating
evidence from a month prior that appeared to back up Peres accusations.
Thats one of several hypothetical cases Recorded Future runs in its
blog
devoted to intelligence analysis.
But its safe to assume that the company
already has at least one spy agencys attention. In-Q-Tel doesnt make
investments in firms without an end customer ready to test out that
companys products.
Both Google Ventures and In-Q-Tel made their investments in 2009, shortly
after the company was founded. The exact amounts werent disclosed, but were
under $10 million each. Googles
investment came to light earlier this year
online. In-Q-Tel, which often announces its new holdings in press releases,
quietly uploaded a
brief mention of its investment a few weeks ago.
Both In-Q-Tel and Google Ventures have seats on Recorded Futures board.
Ahlberg says those board members have been very helpful, providing
business and technology advice, as well as introducing him to potential
customers.
Both organizations, its safe to say, will profit handsomely if
Recorded Future is ever sold or taken public. Ahlbergs last company, the
corporate intelligence firm
Spotfire, was acquired in 2007 for $195 million
in cash.
Google Ventures did not return requests to comment for this article.
In-Q-Tel Chief of Staff Lisbeth Poulos e-mailed a one-line statement:
We
are pleased that Recorded Future is now part of IQTs portfolio of
innovative startup companies who support the mission of the U.S.
Intelligence Community.
Just because Google and In-Q-Tel have both invested in Recorded Future
doesnt mean Google is suddenly in bed with the government.
Of course, to
Googles critics - including
conservative legal groups, and
Republican
congressmen - the
Obama Administration and the Mountain View, California,
company slipped between the sheets a long time ago.
Google CEO Eric Schmidt hosted a town hall at company headquarters in
the early days of Obamas presidential campaign.
Senior White House officials like economic chief
Larry Summers give speeches at the New America Foundation, the
left-of-center think tank chaired by Schmidt. Former Google public policy
chief Andrew McLaughlin is now the White Houses deputy CTO, and was
publicly (if mildly) reprimanded by the administration for continuing to
hash out issues with his former colleagues.
In some corners, the scrutiny of the companys political ties have
dovetailed with concerns about how Google collects and uses its enormous
storehouse of search data, e-mail, maps and online documents.
Google, as we
all know, keeps a titanic amount of information about every aspect of our
online lives.
Customers largely have trusted the company so
far, because of the quality of their products, and because of Googles
pledges not to misuse the information still ring true to many.
But unease has been growing.
Thirty seven state Attorneys General are
demanding answers from the company after Google hoovered up
600 gigabytes of
data from open Wi-Fi networks as it snapped pictures for its Street View
project. (The company swears the incident was an accident.)
Assurances from the likes of Google that
the company can be trusted to respect consumers privacy because its
corporate motto is dont be evil have been shown by recent events such
as the Wi-Spy debacle to be unwarranted, long-time corporate gadfly
John M. Simpson
told a Congressional hearing in a prepared statement.
Any business dealings with the CIAs investment
arm are unlikely to make critics like him more comfortable.
But
Steven Aftergood, a critical observer of the intelligence
community from his perch at the Federation of American Scientists, isnt
worried about the Recorded Future deal.
Yet.
To me, whether this is troublesome or not
depends on the degree of transparency involved. If everything is
aboveboard - from contracts to deliverables - I dont see a problem with
it, he told Danger Room by e-mail.
But if there are blank spots in the
record, then they will be filled with public skepticism or worse, both
here and abroad, and not without reason.
