The Pentagon's advanced research wing has
announced its latest budget - and whoa, does
DARPA
ever have some ambitious plans for the future.
Their new Biotech unit will be harnessing
biology for national security, and dealing with everything from stopping
plagues to building synthetic soldiers. DARPA's commitment to cutting-edge
innovation is unquestioned.
The very essence of the defense agency is to
make sure that U.S. military technology is more sophisticated than that of
the nation's rivals.
Among its many current initiatives, DARPA is
working on,
In addition to these projects, DARPA has been
busy at work on various biotechnology-related endeavors, but these attempts
to date have lacked cohesion and focus.
Looking to change this, DARPA has announced the
creation of its
Biological Technologies Office (BTO) - an effort to,
"explore the the
increasingly dynamic intersection of biology and the physical sciences."
The new division will expand upon its
Defense Sciences (DSO) and
Microsystems Technology (MTO) Offices.
Speaking to the U.S. House of Representatives
last week, DARPA Director Arati Prabhakar said that,
"Biology is nature's ultimate innovator, and
any agency that hangs its hat on innovation would be foolish not to look
to this master of networked complexity for inspiration and solutions."
Indeed, the new division will look into three
incredibly promising research areas.
The Transhuman Soldier
A priority for DARPA is in restoring and
maintaining the abilities of its war-fighters. It wants to maintain peak
soldier abilities and then restore those abilities as soon as possible after
an injury.
This will include the development of advanced
prosthetics (featuring mind-controlled limbs), neural interfaces, the
ability to survive blood loss, and even neurotechnological solutions to
treat psychological trauma such as PTSD.
DARPA has already made tremendous strides in
this area.
Speaking to
NPR's Marketplace, Prabhakar noted:
We had quadriplegic volunteers who agreed to
have brain surgery, essentially have a small array placed on the surface
of their brains, to pick up these neural signals for motor control, and
then to use those to control these new, very sophisticated, robotic,
prosthetic arms.
In a sense we've opened a door - a
connection between the human brain and the rest of the world. You can
let your imagination go wild about where that's going to take us.
No doubt - many of these therapeutic
technologies will be leveraged to enhance the capacities of soldiers.
For example,
work on memory impairments is leading to new insights into the brain's
functioning. This will inform the development of technologies that will help
soldiers interact with complex systems; future interfaces and tools will
deliver information to soldiers in a way that's easier for them to
understand (which is a growing problem - our systems are starting to operate
faster than human comprehension).
As Prabhakar says, there's,
"going to be a future where we start
learning radically new ways to interact between the complexity of the
human brain and the complexity of the world around us."
And with the introduction of its
biochronicity program, DARPA could get a handle on human metabolism and
aging, resulting in enhanced human combat performance and freakishly
resilient soldiers (both in terms of resisting and recovering from physical
injury and resistance to disease).
In addition, DARPA is looking to develop
technologies that will identify and protect against infectious diseases,
such as tools that will neutralize biological threats.
To Seek Out - And Create - New
Life
The Pentagon also wants to dabble in artificial
life as a way to create completely new biological systems, products, and
materials.
It's hoping to gain a better understanding of
natural process and the underlying design rules that govern the behavior of
biological systems, and then apply that knowledge to forward-engineer new
systems and products with completely novel functionality.
This is particularly interesting news
considering that
biologists have recently built an artificial chromosome from scratch.
Once refined, this biotechnology will allow for
the creation of entirely new organisms, while adding new capacities (or
"features") to existing ones - including humans. Imagine a soldier who never
needs to sleep, requires minimal sustenance, or who has
cat-like infrared vision.
Artificial chromosomes could pave the way
towards this kind of future - technologies that could eventually trickle
into the civilian domain (much like the Internet and GPS has - both military
innovations).
Interestingly, this meshes well with DARPA's
existing
BioDesign program which is studying the potential for synthetic
organisms to be engineered for immortality and programmed with a kill switch
that allows it to be turned off at any time.
This recently prompted Motherboard's
Meghan Neal to
ask,
"Why bother with mechanical robots when you
can engineer fake human replicants to fight your battles?
We haven't heard much about the Pentagon's
would-be synthetic soldiers since then, but the BioDesign program got a
bump from $11.4 to $19.3 million in
next year's budget."
As part of the BTO initiative, DARPA's Living
Foundries program will focus on:
...creating a biologically based
manufacturing platform to provide rapid, scalable access to new
materials with novel properties that can enable a new generation of
mechanical, electrical, and optical products.
While its Chronicle of Lineage Indicative of
Origins (CLIO) program aims to:
-
make biological engineering safer by
establishing enduring control elements that protect against
intentionally harmful genetic engineering
-
prevent illegal acquisition or misuse of
proprietary strains,
-
provide novel forensic tools to assist
in the investigation of biological incidents
-
allow responsible investigators to
document compliance with safe biological manipulation practices
Preventing Plagues
Smartly, DARPA is also looking into ways of
preventing and mitigating the effects of a global pandemic.
The complexity and unpredictability of
outbreaks, it says, is a reflection of our poor understanding of the
dynamics involved. In addition, the research agency wants to study larger
biological and ecological phenomena, including population-level effects of
relevance to agriculture and food security.
With its launch of BTO, DARPA says it also
wants to consider the implications of what it's doing.
To that end, DARPA will periodically
converse with experts in these issues to discuss relevant
ethical, legal, and social issues
