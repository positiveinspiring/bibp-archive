Democrats who had been programmed to blindly vote for Hillary Clinton are picking their jaws up off the floor after learning the truth about Hillary's ties to Monsanto.
The ties run so deep that she's now being dubbed the "Bride of Frankenfood." Shockingly, Hillary Clinton's ties to Monsanto are new information to her liberal support base.
It drives home the important point that nearly everyone supporting Hillary Clinton has no idea who she really is, as evidenced by this stunning new video from Mark Dice and Luke Rudkowski.
"Hillary Rodham Clinton's ties to agribusiness giant Monsanto, and her advocacy for the industry's genetically modified crops, have environmentalists in Iowa calling her 'Bride of Frankenfood'," reports the Washington Times. "A large faction of women voiced strong support for Mrs. Clinton's candidacy until the GMO issue came up, prompting them to switch allegiances to Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, a liberal stalwart challenging her for the Democratic nomination."

Oh my, how little they really know about the real Hillary Clinton... keep reading to find out more...
Monsanto and Bill Gates are top donors to the Clinton Family Foundation
A quick look at this table of Clinton Family Foundation donors reveals both the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Monsanto as two of the heavy-hitting donors to the Clinton "Crime" Family Foundation. Bill Gates, of course, pushes vaccines on the world, while Monsanto pushes GMOs. It's a toxic one-two punch for global depopulation. Hillary Clinton's donors also include,
the drug maker Pfizer ExxonMobil Dow Chemical Goldman Sachs Procter & Gamble Coca-Cola,

...and many more.
It's a who's who compilation of the most evil corporations and institutions on planet Earth, and they've all given huge money - tens of millions of dollars - to Hillary Clinton. All the corporations are, of course, buying influence with the Clintons. This obvious fact was wildly attacked by extreme leftist Democratic party operatives like George Stephanopoulos, who turned out to have hidden his own $75,000 in donations to the same Clinton Foundation.
He claims he thought he was donating to halt "deforestation." Hillaryious!
If you're still not convinced that Hillary Clinton has strong ties to Monsanto, ask yourself why she just hired a prominent Monsanto lobbyist to run her campaign. As True Activist reports:
Hillary Clinton recently announced that she will be appointing long-time Monsanto lobbyist Jerry Crawford as adviser to her "Ready for Hillary" super PAC... Over the years, Crawford has been instrumental in fighting against small farmers in court and protecting Monsanto's seed monopoly.

Over the years, Crawford has been instrumental in fighting against small farmers in court and protecting Monsanto's seed monopoly.
Jerry Crawford is an "equal opportunity payola operative" who hands out political bribes to members of both parties.
"Crawford has mostly worked with Democratic politicians in the past, but has also put his support behind Republican candidates as well. Anyone who was willing to support Monsanto's goals would receive support from Crawford," says TrueActivist.com.
Back in the 1990s, during the era when Vince Foster was murdered for what he knew about the Clintons, Hillary Clinton was a partner at the Rose Law Firm.
This law firm counted Monsanto as its client:
"Her history of backing GMO dates back to her early days in Arkansas as a lawyer with the Rose Law Firm, which represented Monsanto and other agribusiness leaders," reports the Washington Times.
Almost none of today's activist voters are even old enough to remember the Rose Law Firm, the Clintons' Whitewater scandal, or even the fact that Hillary Clinton ran the media attacks on all the women who tried to go public with claims of being sexually violated by Bill Clinton. (Yes, Hillary ran the "blame the victim" campaign to protect Bill!) Yet in an age where progressives demand full transparency on all the issues that matter to them most - immigration, gay marriage, gun control and so on - Hillary finds herself squarely on the wrong side of the GMO issue.
She's a puppet for Monsanto and all its toxic practices that destroy life and destroy the environment.
At every opportunity, Hillary Clinton pushes toxic chemicals, pesticides and herbicides that contaminate the food supply, promote human diseases like Alzheimer's and even threaten destruction of the environment.
Hillary Clinton, Bride of Frankenfood, is also a "chemical holocaust" pusher who works hard to make sure every woman and child in America eats food laced with cancer-causing glyphosate.
"In the GMO debate, Mrs. Clinton has consistently sided with the chemical companies," says the Washington Times. "A new scientific study bolstered environmentalists' concerns by finding the herbicide Roundup could be linked to a range of health problems and diseases, including Parkinson's, infertility and cancers. The study published last month in the scientific journal Entropy also reported evidence that residue of glyphosate, a chief ingredient in the weed killer, has been found in food."

That food, of course, enriches Monsanto and the other biotech firms, many of which kick back huge donations to Hillary Clinton as long as she keeps pushing poison. A vote for Hillary, it turns out, is a vote for Monsanto.
It's not just GMOs, either, that haunt the real history of Hillary Clinton.
As The Atlantic reported this year, Hillary Clinton was also instrumental in handing the Russian government a near-monopoly over nuclear weapons uranium supplies. All the while, money was flowing into the Clinton foundation from uranium interests:
In total, people affiliated with Uranium One or its predecessor gave more than $8 million to the Clinton Foundation between 2008 and 2010. Meanwhile, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech in Moscow, paid for by a bank boosting Uranium One stock.
Why does this matter to the Clinton voter support base? Because progressives are rightly anti-nuclear power and anti-nuke weapons.
Yet their gender champion Hillary Clinton is out there promoting the proliferation of nuclear fuel and nuclear weapons, all while raking in millions of dollars for her own foundation in exchange for selling her influence to the highest bidder.
Suddenly a Clinton presidency doesn't sound so "progressive," does it?
Just to make sure no one is confused about where Hillary Clinton really stands on the issue of GMOs and biotech, she openly parrots Monsanto's quack science talking points in public. In 2014, she spoke at the Biotechnology Industry Organization and practiced running Monsanto's talking points, saying:
I stand in favor of using seeds and products that have a proven track record... And to continue to try to make the case for those who are skeptical that they may not know what they're eating already. The question of genetically modified food or hybrids has gone on for many many years. And there is again a big gap between what the facts are and what perceptions are...

During the speech, Clinton basically says that all anti-GMO people are anti-science idiots who don't know "the facts."
Those "facts," of course, are all contrived by Monsanto itself and its deep network of financial influence over scientists, universities and even the lamestream media.
Hillary Clinton basically concludes that since you don't know you've already been eating GMOs, then it's safe to keep doing so. See the sickening video here:
If you've ever wondered why there's almost no willingness among 100+ million Democrats to challenge Hillary Clinton for the nomination, it's because Democrats are terrified of Hillary. As the joke goes, Hillary Clinton not only knows where all the bodies are buried... she ordered them put there in the first place! For decades, the Clintons were able to control the official narrative and construct a false image of who they really are and what they really believe. But now, thanks to the Independent Media which is now dominating in viewership and is trusted far more than the mainstream media, the Clintons can't roll out their usual revisionist history and expect it to work. The simple truth - to the great horror of progressives everywhere - is that Hillary Clinton has long sold out to chemical agriculture and biotech. She's your RoundUp-Ready she-whore... your Monsanto Matriarch... the "Glyphosate Mamma" armed with fists full of toxic fury.
And she wants your vote because she's going to dethrone the one percent? Seriously? Pathetic.
Hillary Clinton is FUNDED by the one percent! If you think Hillary Clinton opposes the one percent, you must also believe ExxonMobil opposes drilling for oil.
There are so many ties between Clinton and Monsanto that the evil biotech corporation is practically Hillary's running mate.
Clinton / Monsanto for President, 2016! And if Clinton becomes president, you can expect the full Monsanto agenda to be aggressively pushed as national policy:
A nationwide federal ban on GMO labeling. Immediate USDA approval of all experimental GMO crops. Extreme, politically motivated attacks against all anti-GMO activists, scientists and journalists. Huge increases in taxpayer-funded subsidies for farmers who grow GMO crops. Aggressive corporate imperialism push to overturn bans on glyphosate and GMOs by other nations. Possibly even attempts by the FDA to outlaw non-GMO Project Verified labels in the same way they attacked hormone-free labels for cow's milk.

Make no mistake: A vote for Hillary is a vote for Monsanto.
