Water is not scarce. It is made up of the first
and third most common elements
in the universe, and the two readily react to
form a highly stable compound that maintains its integrity even at
temperature extremes.
Hydrologist Dr. Vincent Kotwicki, in his
paper
Water in The Universe, writes:
"Water appears to be one of the most
abundant molecules in the Universe. It dominates the environment of the
Earth and is a main constituent of numerous planets, moons and comets.
On a far greater scale, it possibly contributes to the so-called
'missing mass' [i.e., dark matter] of the Universe and may initiate the
birth of stars inside the giant molecular clouds."
Oxygen has been found in the newly discovered
"cooling flows" - heavy rains of gas that appear to be falling into galaxies
from the space once thought empty surrounding them, giving rise to yet more
water.
How much is out there? No one can even take a
guess, since no one knows the composition of the
dark matter that makes up
as much as 90% of the mass of the universe.
If comets, which are mostly ice,
are a large constituent of dark matter, then, as Dr. Kotwicki writes,
"the
remote uncharted (albeit mostly frozen) oceans are truly unimaginably big."
Back home, Earth is often referred to as the
"water planet," and it certainly looks that way from space. H2O
covers about 70% of the surface of the globe.
It makes all life as we know it possible.
The Blue Planet?
However it got here - theories abound from
outgassing of volcanic eruptions to deposits by passing comets and ancient
crossed orbits - water is what gives our planet its lovely, unique blue
tint, and there appears to be quite a lot of it.
That old axiom that the earth is 75% water...
not quite. In reality, water constitutes only 0.07% of the earth by mass, or
0.4% by volume.
This is how much we have, depicted graphically:

What this shows is the relative size of our
water supply if it were all gathered together into a ball and superimposed
on the globe.
The large blob, centered over the western US, is
all water (oceans, icecaps, glaciers, lakes, rivers, groundwater, and water
in the atmosphere). It's a sphere about 860 miles in diameter, or roughly
the distance from Salt Lake City to Topeka. The smaller sphere, over
Kentucky, is the fresh water in the ground and in lakes, rivers, and swamps.
Now examine the image closely. See that last,
tiny dot over Georgia? It's the fresh water in lakes and rivers.
Looked at another way, that ball of all the
water in the world represents a total volume of about 332.5 million cubic
miles. But of this, 321 million mi3, or 96.5%, is saline - great
for fish, but undrinkable without the help of nature or some serious
hardware. That still leaves a good bit of fresh water, some 11.6 million mi3,
to play with.
Unfortunately, the bulk of that is locked up in
icecaps, glaciers, and permanent snow, or is too far underground to be
accessible with today's technology. (The numbers come from the USGS;
obviously, they are estimates and they change a bit every year, but they are
accurate enough for our purposes.)
Accessible groundwater amounts to 5.614 million
mi3, with 55% of that saline, leaving a little over 2.5 million
mi3 of fresh groundwater.
That translates to about 2.7 exa-gallons of
fresh water, or about 2.7 billion billion gallons (yes billions of billions,
or 1018 in scientific notation), which is about a third of a
billion gallons of water per person. Enough to take a long shower every day
for many lifetimes...
However, not all of that groundwater is easily
or cheaply accessible.
The truth is that the surface is the source for the
vast majority - nearly 80% - of our water. Of surface waters, lakes hold
42,320 mi3, only a bit over half of which is fresh, and the
world's rivers hold only 509 mi3 of fresh water,
less than 2/10,000 of 1% of the planetary
total.
And that's where the problem lies. In 2005 in
the US alone, we humans used about 328 billion gallons of surface water
per day, compared to about 83 billion gallons per day of
water from the ground. Most of that surface water, by far, comes from
rivers.
Among these, one of the most important is the
mighty Colorado.

Tapping Ol' Man River
Or perhaps we should say,
"the river formerly
known as the mighty Colorado."
That old Colorado - the one celebrated in
centuries of American Western song and folklore; the one that exposed two
billion years of geologic history in the awesome Grand Canyon - is gone. In
its place is
well, Las Vegas - the world's gaudiest monument to hubristic
human overreach, and a big neon sign advertising the predicament now faced
by much of the world.
It's well to remember that most of the US west
of the Mississippi ranges from relatively dry to very arid, to desert, to
lifeless near-moonscapes. The number of people that could be supported by
the land, especially in the Southwest, was always small and concentrated
along the riverbanks.
Tribal clusters died out with some regularity.
And that's the way it would have remained, except for a bit of ingenuity
that suddenly loosed two powerful forces on the area: electrical power, and
an abundance of water that seemed as limitless as the sky.
In September of 1935, President Roosevelt
dedicated the pinnacle of engineering technology up to that point:
Hoover
Dam.
The dam did two things. It served as a massive hydroelectric generating
plant, and it backed up the Colorado River behind it, creating Lake Mead,
the largest reservoir in the country.
Early visitors dubbed Hoover Dam the "Eighth
Wonder of the World," and it's easy to see why. It was built on a scale
unlike anything before it. It's 725 feet high and contains 6 million tons of
concrete, which would pave a road from New York to Los Angeles. Its 19
generators produce 2,080 MW of electricity, enough to power 1.75 million
average homes.
The artificially created Lake Mead is 112 miles
long, with a maximum depth of 590 feet. It has a surface area of 250 square
miles and an active capacity of 16 million acre-feet.
Hoover Dam was intended to generate sufficient
power and impound an ample amount of water, to meet any conceivable need.
But as things turned out, grand as the dam is, it wasn't conceived grandly
enough... because it is 35 miles from Las Vegas, Nevada.
Vegas had a permanent population in 1935 of
8,400, a number that swelled to 25,000 during the dam construction as
workers raced in to take jobs that were scarce in the early Depression
years. Those workers, primarily single men, needed something to do with
their spare time, so the Nevada state legislature legalized gambling in
1931. Modern Vegas was born.
The rise of Vegas is well chronicled, from a
middle-of-nowhere town to the largest city founded in the 20th
century and the fastest-growing in the nation - up until the 2008 housing
bust.
Somehow, those 8,400 souls turned into a present
population of over 2 million that exists all but entirely to service the 40
million tourists who visit annually. And all this is happening in a desert
that sees an average of 10 days of measurable rainfall per year, totaling
about 4 inches.
In order to run all those lights, fountains, and
revolving stages, Las Vegas requires 5,600 MW of electricity on a summer
day. Did you notice that that's more than 2.5 times what the giant Hoover
Dam can put out? Not to mention that those 42 million people need a lot of
water to drink to stay properly hydrated in the 100+ degree heat. And it all
comes from Lake Mead.
So what do you think is happening to the lake?
If your guess was, "it's shrinking," you're right.
The combination of recent drought years in the
West and rapidly escalating demand has been a dire double-whammy, reducing
the lake to 40% full. Normally, the elevation of Lake Mead is 1,219 feet.
Today, it's at 1,086 feet and dropping by ten feet a year (and
accelerating). That's how much more water is being taken out than is being
replenished.
This is science at its simplest. If your
extraction of a renewable resource exceeds its ability to recharge itself,
it will disappear - end of story. In the case of Lake Mead, that means going
dry, an eventuality to which hydrologists assign a 50% probability in the
next twelve years. That's by 2025.
Nevadans are not unaware of this. There is at
the moment a frantic push to get approval for a massive pipeline project
designed to bring in water from the more favored northern part of the state.
Yet even if the pipeline were completed in time, and there is stiff
opposition to it (and you thought only oil pipelines gave way to politics
and protests), that would only resolve one issue. There's another. A big
one.
Way before people run out of drinking water,
something else happens:
When Lake Mead falls below 1,050 feet, the
Hoover Dam's turbines shut down - less than four years from now, if the
current trend holds - and in Vegas the lights start going out.
What Doesn't Stay in
Vegas
Ominously, these water woes are not confined to
Las Vegas. Under contracts signed by President Obama in December
2011, Nevada gets only 23.37% of the electricity generated by the Hoover
Dam.
The other top recipients:
-
Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California (28.53%)
-
state of Arizona (18.95%)
-
city of Los Angeles (15.42%)
-
Southern California Edison (5.54%)
You can always build more power plants, but you
can't build more rivers, and the mighty Colorado carries the lifeblood of
the Southwest.
It services the water needs of an area the size
of France, in which live 40 million people. In its natural state, the river
poured 15.7 million acre-feet of water into the Gulf of California each
year.
Today, twelve years of drought have reduced the flow to about 12
million acre-feet, and human demand siphons off every bit of it; at its
mouth, the riverbed is nothing but dust.
Nor is the decline in the water supply important
only to the citizens of Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. It's critical
to the whole country. The Colorado is the sole source of water for
southeastern California's Imperial Valley, which has been made into one of
the most productive agricultural areas in the US despite receiving an
average of three inches of rain per year.
The Valley is fed by an intricate system
consisting of 1,400 miles of canals and 1,100 miles of pipeline.
They are
the only reason a bone-dry desert can look like this:
Intense conflicts over water will probably not
be confined to the developing world. So far, Arizona, California, Nevada,
New Mexico, and Colorado have been able to make and keep agreements defining
who gets how much of the Colorado River's water.
But if populations continue to grow while the
snowcap recedes, it's likely that the first shots will be fired before long,
in US courtrooms.
If legal remedies fail
a war between Phoenix
and LA might seem far-fetched, but at the minimum some serious upheaval will
eventually ensue unless an alternative is found quickly.
A Litany of Crises
Water scarcity is, of course, not just a
domestic issue. It is far more critical in other parts of the world than in
the US. It will decide the fate of people and of nations.
Worldwide, we are using potable water way faster
than it can be replaced.
Just a few examples:
-
In Africa, desertification is proceeding
at an alarming rate. Much of the northern part of the continent is
already desert, of course.
But beyond that, a US Department of
Agriculture study places about 2.5 million km2 of African
land at low risk of desertification, 3.6 million km2 at
moderate risk, 4.6 million km2 at high risk, and 2.9
million km2 at very high risk.
-
"The region that has the
highest propensity," the report says, "is located along the desert
margins and occupies about 5% of the land mass. It is estimated that
about 22 million people (2.9% of the total population) live in this
area."
-
A 2009 study published in the American
Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate analyzed 925
major rivers from 1948 to 2004 and found an overall decline in total
discharge. The reduction in inflow to the Pacific Ocean alone was
about equal to shutting off the Mississippi River.
The list of
rivers that serve large human populations and experienced a
significant decline in flow includes the Amazon, Congo, Chang Jiang
(Yangtze), Mekong, Ganges, Irrawaddy, Amur, Mackenzie, Xijiang,
Columbia, and Niger.
Supply is not the only issue. There's also
potability.
Right now, 40% of the global population has
little to no access to clean water, and despite somewhat tepid modernization
efforts, that figure is actually expected to jump to 50% by 2025. When
there's no clean water, people will drink dirty water - water contaminated
with human and animal waste. And that breeds illness.
It's estimated that fully half of the world's
hospital beds today are occupied by people with water-borne diseases. Food production is also a major contributor to
water pollution.
To take two examples:
-
The "green revolution" has proven to
have an almost magical ability to provide food for an
ever-increasing global population, but at a cost. Industrial
cultivation is extremely water intensive, with 80% of most US
states' water usage going to agriculture - and in some, it's as high
as 90%. In addition, factory farming uses copious amounts of
fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides, creating serious problems
for the water supply because of toxic runoff.
-
Modern livestock facilities - known as
concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) - create enormous
quantities of animal waste that is pumped into holding ponds. From
there, some of it inevitably seeps into the groundwater, and the
rest eventually has to be dumped somewhere. Safe disposal practices
are often not followed, and regulatory oversight is lax. As a
result, adjacent communities' drinking water can come to contain
dangerously high levels of E. coli bacteria and other
harmful organisms.
Not long ago, scientists discovered a whole new
category of pollutants that no one had previously thought to test for:
drugs.
We are a nation of pill poppers and needle
freaks, and the drugs we introduce into our bodies are only partially
absorbed. The remainder is excreted and finds its way into the water supply.
Samples recently taken from Lake Mead revealed detectable levels of birth
control medication, steroids, and narcotics... which people and wildlife are
drinking.
Most lethal of all are industrial pollutants
that continue to find their way into the water supply. The carcinogenic
effects of these compounds have been well documented, as the movie-famed
Erin Brockovich did with hexavalent chromium.
But the problem didn't go away with Brockovich's
court victory. The sad fact is that little has changed for the better. In
the US, our feeble attempt to deal with these threats was the passage in
1980 of the so-called Superfund Act.
That law gave the federal government - and
specifically the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) - the authority to
respond to chemical emergencies and to clean up uncontrolled or abandoned
hazardous-waste sites on both private and public lands. And it supposedly
provided money to do so.
How's that worked out?
According to the Government Accountability
Office (GAO),
"After decades of spearheading restoration
efforts in areas such as the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay,
improvements in these water bodies remain elusive
EPA continues to face the challenges posed
by an aging wastewater infrastructure that results in billions of
gallons of untreated sewage entering our nation's water bodies
Lack of rapid water-testing methods and
development of current water quality standards continue to be issues
that EPA needs to address."
Translation: the EPA hasn't produced.
How much of this is due to the typical drag of a
government bureaucracy and how much to lack of funding is debatable. Whether
there might be a better way to attack the problem is debatable. But what is
not debatable is the magnitude of the problem stacking up, mostly
unaddressed.
Just consider that the EPA has a backlog of
1,305 highly toxic Superfund cleanup sites on its to-do list, in every state
in the union (except apparently North Dakota, in case you want to try to
escape - though the proliferation of
hydraulic fracking in that area may
quickly change the map, according to some of its detractors - it's a hotly
debated assertion).
About 11 million people in the US, including 3-4
million children, live within one mile of a federal Superfund site.
The health of all of them is at immediate risk,
as is that of those living directly downstream.
We could go on about this for page after page.
The situation is depressing, no question. And even more so is the fact that
there's little we can do about it. There is no technological quick fix.
Peak oil we can handle. We find new sources, we
develop alternatives, and/or prices rise. It's all but certain that by the
time we actually run out of oil, we'll already have shifted to something
else.
But "peak water" is a different story. There are
no new sources; what we have is what we have. Absent a profound climate
change that turns the evaporation/rainfall hydrologic cycle much more to our
advantage, there likely isn't going to be enough to around.
As the biosphere continually adds more billions
of humans (the UN projects there will be another 3.5 billion people on the
planet, a greater than 50% increase, by 2050 before a natural plateau really
starts to dampen growth), the demand for clean water has the potential to
far outstrip dwindling supplies. If that comes to pass, the result will be
catastrophic.
People around the world are already suffering
and dying en masse from lack of access to something drinkable...
and the problems look poised to get worse long before they get better.
Searching for a Way Out
With a problem of this magnitude, there is no
such thing as a comprehensive solution.
Instead, it will have to be addressed by
chipping away at the problem in a number of ways, which the world is
starting to do.
With much water not located near population
centers, transportation will have to be a major part of the solution. With
oil, a complex system of pipelines, tankers, and trucking fleets has been
erected, because it's been profitable to do so. The commodity has a high
intrinsic value. Water doesn't - or at least hasn't in most of the modern
era's developed economies - and thus delivery has been left almost entirely
to gravity.
Further, the construction of pipelines for water
that doesn't flow naturally means taking a vital resource from someone and
giving it to someone else, a highly charged political and social issue
that's been known to lead to protest and even violence.
But until we've
piped all the snow down from Alaska to California, transportation will be
high on the list of potential near term solutions, especially to individual
supply crunches, just as it has been with energy.
Conservation measures may help too, at least in
the developed world, though the typical lawn-watering restrictions will
hardly make a dent. Real conservation will have to come from curtailing
industrial uses like farming and fracking.
But these bandage solutions can only forestall
the inevitable without other advances to address the problems.
Thankfully, where there is a challenge, there
are always technology innovators to help address it. It was wells and
aqueducts that let civilization move from the riverbank inland, irrigation
that made communal farming scale, and sewers and pipes that turned villages
into cities, after all. And just as with the dawn of industrial water,
entrepreneurs are developing some promising tech developments, too.
Given how much water we use today, there's
little doubt that conservation's sibling, recycling, is going to be big.
Microfiltration systems are very sophisticated and can produce recycled
water that is near-distilled in quality. Large-scale production remains a
challenge, as is the reluctance of people to drink something that was
reclaimed from human waste or industrial runoff. But that might just require
the right spokesperson.
California believes so, in any case, as it
forges ahead with its
Porcelain Springs initiative.
A company called APTwater has taken on the
important task of purifying contaminated leachate water (below video) from
landfills that would otherwise pollute the groundwater:
This is simply using technology to accelerate
the natural process of replenishment by using energy, but if it can be done
at scale, we will eventually reach the point where trading oil or coal for
clean drinking water makes economic sense. It's already starting to in many
places.
Inventor Dean Kamen of Segway fame has
created the Slingshot, a water-purification machine that could be a
lifesaver for small villages in more remote areas.
The size of a dorm-room refrigerator, it can
produce 250 gallons of water a day, using the same amount of energy it takes
to run a hair dryer, provided by an engine that can burn just about anything
(it's been run on cow dung). The Slingshot is designed to be
maintenance-free for at least five years.
Kamen says you can,
"stick the intake hose into
anything wet - arsenic-laden water, salt water, the latrine, the holding
tanks of a chemical waste treatment plant; really, anything wet - and the
outflow is one hundred percent pure pharmaceutical-grade injectable water."
That naturally presupposes there is something
wet to tap into.
But Coca-Cola, for one, is a believer. This September, Coke
entered into a
partnership with Kamen's company, Deka Research, to distribute
Slingshots in Africa and Latin America.
Ceramic filters are another, low-tech
option for rural areas. Though clean water output is very modest, they're
better than nothing. The ability to decontaminate stormwater runoff would be
a boon for cities, and
AbTech Industries is producing a product to
do just that.
In really arid areas, the only water present may
be what's held in the air.
Is it possible to tap that source? "Yes," say a
couple of cutting-edge tech startups.
Eole Water proposes to extract atmospheric moisture using a wind
turbine. Another company, NBD Nano, has come up with a
self-filling water bottle that mimics the Namib Desert beetle. Whether
the technology is scalable to any significant degree remains to be seen.
And finally, what about seawater? There's an
abundance of that. If you ask a random sampling of folks in the street what
we're going to do about water shortages on a larger scale, most of them will
answer, "desalination." No problem. Well, yes problem.
Desalination (sometimes shortened to "desalt")
plants are already widespread, and their output is ramping up rapidly.
According to the International Desalination Association, in 2009 there were
14,451 desalination plants operating worldwide, producing about 60 million
cubic meters of water per day. That figure rose to 68 million m3/day
in 2010 and is expected to double to 120 million m3/day by 2020.
That sounds impressive, but the stark reality is that it amounts to only
around a quarter of one percent (0.25%) of global water consumption.
Boiling seawater and collecting the condensate
has been practiced by sailors for nearly two millennia.
The same basic principle is employed today,
although it has been refined into a procedure called "multistage flash
distillation," in which the boiling is done at less than atmospheric
pressure, thereby saving energy. This process accounts for 85% of all
desalination worldwide.
The remainder comes from "reverse osmosis,"
which uses semipermeable membranes and pressure to separate salts from
water.
The primary drawbacks to desalt are that a plant
obviously has to be located near the sea, and that it is an expensive,
highly energy-intensive process. That's why you find so many desalt
facilities where energy is cheap, in the oil-rich, water-poor nations of the
Middle East.
Making it work in California will be much more
difficult without drastically raising the price of water. And Nevada? Out of
luck. Improvements in the technology are bringing costs of production down,
but the need for energy, and lots of it, isn't going away. By way of
illustration, suppose the US would like to satisfy half of its water needs
through desalination.
All other factors aside, meeting that goal would
require the construction of more than 100 new electric power plants, each
dedicated solely to that purpose, and each with a
gigawatt
of capacity.
Moving desalinated water from the ocean inland
adds to the expense. The farther you have to transport it and the greater
the elevation change, the less feasible it becomes. That makes desalination
impractical for much of the world.
Nevertheless, the biggest population centers
tend to be clustered along coastlines, and demand is likely to drive water
prices higher over time, making desalt more cost-competitive. So it's a cinch
that the procedure will play a steadily increasing role in supplying the
world's coastal cities with water.
In other related developments, a small tech
startup called NanOasis is working on a desalination process that employs
carbon nanotubes. An innovative
new
project in Australia is demonstrating that food can be grown in the most
arid of areas, with low energy input, using solar-desalinated seawater.
It holds the promise of being very scalable at
moderate cost.
The Future
This article barely scratches the surface of a
very broad topic that has profound implications for the whole of humanity
going forward.
The World Bank's Ismail Serageldin puts it succinctly:
"The
wars of the 21st century will be fought over water."
There's no doubt that this is a looming crisis
we cannot avoid.
Everyone has an interest in water. How quickly we respond
to the challenges ahead is going to be a matter, literally, of life and
death. Where we have choices at all, we had better make some good ones.
From an investment perspective, there are few
ways at present to acquire shares in the companies that are doing research
and development in the field. But you can expect that to change as
technologies from some of these startups begin to hit the market, and as the
economics of water begin to shift in response to the changing global
landscape.
We'll be keeping an eye out for the investment
opportunities that are sure to be on the way.
While profit opportunities in companies working
to solve the world's water woes may not be imminent, there are plenty of
ways to leverage technology to outsized gains right now.
One of the best
involves a technology so revolutionary, its impact could rival that of the
printing press.
