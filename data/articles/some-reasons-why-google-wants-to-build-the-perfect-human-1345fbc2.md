Andrew Conrad, molecular biologist and
lead researcher for
Google X has
been behind the latest push by the tech corporation to get to know their
users better - by collecting data on DNA in order to decipher what a
healthy, normal human being should look like.
If Google X could analyze the DNA of enough
participants, it is suspected that "prevention based treatment strategies"
would allow for the possible removal of traits that cause those diseases
such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer and neurological disorders.
As a side project, Google Ventures has
invested $161
million into 23andMe, a home genetics test that identifies mutations in the
genome that can be removed if desired.
The sample taken from the saliva would be run
through a
gene chip provided by Illumina for deciphering of genetic ancestry and
information on genetic risks, propensities and "mutations" that could lead
to disease during the individual's lifetime.
According to the patent:
"What eye colors their child might have or
if their child will be able to perceive bitter taste or be lactose
intolerant."
Indeed, the clients can peruse a "shopping list"
of genetic traits that can be enhanced or suppressed such as:
Anne Wojcicki, former wife of Google founder
Sergey Brin, said:
"You could say whether you want a kid with
blue eyes or green eyes, a long lifespan, or less risk of colorectal
cancer. Or more risk of colorectal cancer, if that's what you're into.
The system then runs the database of your
genes against others, to recommend a mating match that would be likely
to produce a child with said traits."
Google X has
been developing animal-inspired
robots, self-driving cars and even "smart" contact lenses (below

Conrad
explained:
"With any complex system, the notion has
always been there to proactively address problems. That's not
revolutionary.
We are just asking the question: If we really wanted to
be proactive, what would we need to know? You need to know what the
fixed, well-running thing should look like."
The Google Baseline Study project (BSP) is a
ginormous genetic and molecular collection of "anonymous" from 175
participants. It is hoped that this number will grow to help create,
"the fullest picture of what a healthy human
being should be."
Conrad's team consists of 70 to 100 biologists,
biochemists and experts in imaging, physiology and molecular biology in
order to increase our understanding of disease in the human body.
Conrad said:
"The study may, for instance,
reveal a biomarker that helps some people break down fatty foods
efficiently, helping them live a long time without high cholesterol and
heart disease.
Others may lack this trait and succumb to
early heart attacks. Once Baseline has identified the biomarker,
researchers could check if other people lack it and help them modify
their behavior or develop a new treatment to help them break down fatty
foods better."
Duke University (DU) and Stanford University
(SU) and other academia are
collaborating with Google X to identify,
"molecular and genetic markers to compare
with corresponding medical records."
Earlier this month, Alcon, the eye care company
for the Swedish pharmaceutical Novartis, obtained
licensed technology for a "smart lens" from Google X.
The two corporations are focused on
assisting diabetics with a smart lens that will,
"measure the tear fluid
in the eye and track the glucose levels in the patient."
Brian Otis and Babak Parviz, founder of the
smart lens project for Google X, explained:
"We're now testing a smart
contact lens that's built to measure glucose levels in tears using a tiny
wireless chip and miniaturized glucose sensor that are embedded between two
layers of soft contact lens material.
We're testing prototypes that can generate a
reading once per second."
Google X said:
"It's still early days for this technology,
but we've completed multiple clinical research studies which are helping
to refine our prototype. We hope this could someday lead to a new way
for people with diabetes to manage their disease."
The lens is bordered with sensors and microchips
that could attempt to correct vision problems for patients with presbyopia
via an autofocus capability.
Research for this device began
several years ago with the University of Washington (UoW) and the National
Science Foundation (NSF) who invested funding.
Beta-testing of the lens was conducted
on volunteers in in the San Francisco Bay area.
Concerning U.S. regulators, Google said:
"We've
completed multiple clinical research studies which are helping to refine our
prototype
We're in discussions with the FDA, but there's still a lot more
work to do to turn this technology into a system that people can use."
