The relation between the suspected Boston Marathon bombers and,
...is a point of contention and controversy.
The FBI, at first, claimed no knowledge of the bombing suspects but later
was forced to admit having received at least two sets of intelligence
reports, one from Russian officials and another from the CIA, identifying
one of the suspected bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, as a potential
security threat - linked to a Chechen terrorist organization.
Testimony from Tsarnaev's mother and father indicates that
the
FBI was active in following, harassing and interrogating the
suspect before the bombing.
Despite general directives from the US
Departments of Justice and Homeland Security mandating US security to
aggressively pursue 'Islamist terrorists', the FBI claims to have made no
effort to follow-up on the Russian and CIA security alerts, especially after
Tamerlan Tsarnaev returned from Russian state of Dagestan last year where he
allegedly met six times with a known Chechen terrorist, Gadzhimurad
Dolgatov, in a fundamentalist Salafi mosque.
The official government and corporate media versions claim the FBI may have
'over-looked' the security risk posed by Tsarnaev.
Congressional critics argue that the FBI was
'negligent' in following up leads provided by the Russians and the CIA. A
more likely explanation is that the FBI was actively engaged with Tsarnaev
and deliberately encouraged the conspiracy for self-serving purposes.
The most benign hypothesis is that the FBI was using Tsarnaev as a means of
infiltrating and securing intelligence on other possible 'terrorists'.
A more plausible hypothesis is that the Boston
office of the FBI had set the pair of brothers up for a sting operation in
order to enhance their anti-terrorist credentials - and that the 'operation'
got out of hand - with Tamarlan having his own agenda.
The most likely hypothesis is that the FBI
facilitated the bombing in order to revive the flagging fortunes of the 'war
on terror' foisted on a war-weary and economically depressed
American public.
The FBI in Boston has a long and notorious history of working with and
protecting certain leaders of organized crime in return for information
about targeted rivals:
The most notorious example is the FBI's
20-year 'partnership' with one of Boston's most feared gangland killers,
James 'Whitey' Bulger, where the mobster was provided with protection
and collaboration in return for his information about a rival crime
family and other competitors.
In 2012, Bulger was finally indicted for 19
murders mostly committed under FBI 'protection' - although one of his
closest mob-partners claims he murdered 40 people in his lifetime.
The 'Boston Bombings' served as a detonator to mobilize the entire US
security apparatus; it has led to the suspension of constitutional
guaranties. It has been accompanied by an intense mass media campaign
glorifying police state operations and the
imposition of virtual martial law in the Boston metropolitan area
of over 4.5 million inhabitants.
The military police operation and media campaign
aroused fear and terror among the public.
Instant psychodrama produced mass worship of the
'heroic' police:
they were portrayed as having saved
the public from unknown numbers of armed terrorists lurking in their
neighborhoods.
The police, the FBI and the entire Security
Apparatus, were repeatedly 'honored' at public spectacles, sports and civic
events, lauded as 'guardians' and 'saviors'.
The sordid role of FBI in organizing entrapment
operations was never mentioned.
The hundreds of billions wasted in futile
overseas 'wars against terror' went down the memory hole. The opposition to
Washington's cuts in social programs was diverted almost overnight to
support new funding for US military intervention
in Syria and North Korea, a greater arms
build-up in Israel and domestic security.
The 'Boston Bombings' coincided with the White House dictating a new round
of domestic police state measures and launching a series of aggressive
military moves in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. The Pentagon has
organized its biggest and most threatening air, sea and land military
exercises right on the borders of North Korea.
The White House has encouraged and promoted
Japan's belligerent military posture toward China regarding disputed islands
in the South China Sea.
Secretary of State Kerry has increased
military aid to the Syrian terrorists by at least $130 million and
dispatched hundreds of Special Forces to Jordan to train the jihadi-mercenaries
against the Syrian government.
The White House concocted charges that Damascus
deployed chemical weapons against the rebels to justify direct US military
intervention in Syria.
Closer to home, the White House has given
unconditional support to the violent Venezuelan opposition's post-election
campaign designed to provoke a civil war - while refusing to recognize
the
internationally certified election victory
of President Maduro.
It is very clear
the Obama regime wants to turn the
clock back a decade to recreate the terrible political climate of 2001-02.
He seeks to fabricate a sense of an imminent terrorist threat based on the
'Boston Bombings' in order to re-launch another global military campaign.
Instead of Iraq - the 'threat' is now Syria,
Iran and Lebanon.
Today, the threat is North Korea - tomorrow it
could be China. Today, it is Venezuela - next it could be Argentina, Bolivia
and Ecuador
and the entire edifice of Latin American regional integration.
The civilian casualties and deaths resulting from the 'Boston Bombings',
linked to the US backing and sheltering of Chechen terrorists, are a small
price for Washington to pay if it results in escalating global wars and
greater impunity for the National Police State.
Re-launching a new and more virulent version of militarized global empire
building is of the highest priority.
The targeted countries have global significance:
Venezuela and Iran are oil producing giants,
the backbone of OPEC and adversaries of Israel.
China is the second biggest economy in the
world and the principle challenger to US economic dominance.
Cowering and confusing millions of downwardly
mobile Americans weakens the principle domestic obstacle to bigger and more
comprehensive cuts in social programs in order to finance global wars.
Indeed, the 'Boston Bombings' have larger political and economic
consequences; they set the stage for a new round of wars abroad and
regressive (and repressive) changes at home.
