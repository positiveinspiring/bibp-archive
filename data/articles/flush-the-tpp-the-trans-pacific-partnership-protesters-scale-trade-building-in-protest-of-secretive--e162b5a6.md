Ongoing protests seek to drag
'destructive' trade deals
into the
light...
Protesters
scaled the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative on Monday and dropped banners
calling for greater transparency and an end to "corporatocracy" over the
ongoing and
secretive Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP) trade agreement currently in
the works between the United States and several Pacific nations (Australia,
Brunei, New Zealand, Singapore, Chile, Peru, Vietnam, Malaysia...)
Those negotiations, which have been brokered
entirely behind closed doors, are certain to put corporate profits ahead of
both human rights and environmental concerns, opponents of the pact have
argued.
Today's banner drop comes as part of a series of
actions that started with a
rally on Friday outside of the trade office and will
continue throughout the next several days.
Groups involved in the
ongoing protests include,
Regulating Wall Street is what we need.
Its time to flush the TPP," Melinda St. Louis, international campaigns
director for Public Citizen,
said to the crowd on Friday as she stood in front of a large
cardboard-constructed roll of toilet paper labeled the TPP Death Star.
"Protecting workers is what we need, she
said.
"Americans cannot afford another back-room
deal that offshores manufacturing and service jobs, reduces tax revenues
and pushes down wages and benefits in the jobs that remain," Arthur
Stamoulis, executive director of Citizens Trade Campaign
said Friday.
"Unless exposed to the light of day and real
public participation, the TPP is poised to enrich corporate interests at
the expense of the economy, the environment and public health at home
and abroad."
While the U.S. public and the press have been
locked out of TPP meetings, corporate "trade advisers" have participated and
been given copies of the agreement.
President Barack Obama
announced
Thursday he will push fast-track legislation, otherwise known as Trade
Promotion Authority, which will allow him to push through trade agreements
while taking away congressional powers to amend.
"This is the grand-daddy of trade deals, a
very destructive project, and it is happening completely under the
radar," Chris Townsend, political director for United Electrical, Radio
and Machine Workers of America (UE),
told Common Dreams on Friday.

Citizen's Melinda St. Louis at the protest on Friday:
