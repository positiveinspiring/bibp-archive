# Why Are Globalist Think-Tank Documents Public?

Q. Why are such research documents -
Which Path to Persia?
or "String
of Pearls" - made public on the web?
If these are in fact strategic and provide a
view into the world of powers that run the show on our globe, why would
they allow such "sensitive" information and "plans" to be made public
for everyone to read?
A. You can't keep global empire a secret - by necessity you need
people to believe in your cause - even if you dress it up and spin it as
something other than naked conquest.
The global corporate-financier elite manage
access to information by marketing different levels of it to different
demographics. This has been done throughout all of history.
The
reasoning done with the aristocracy to keep them in line was more
straight-forward and pragmatic than the absolute fantasies used to dupe
and manipulate the common man.
It works in layers - papers like "Which Path to Persia?" being toward
the top are aimed at people who believe in
global governance and
globalization - professors, senior editors, CEOs etc. who falsely
believe they have a stake in the process - and while it is made public,
it is generally inaccessible to the average reader because of its use of
academic English, length, and very high minimal requirements in
understanding the history, strategy, geopolitics, and human nature
necessary to understand the contents.
On
Brookings own website you will also see their policy makers pen
articles & op-eds for newspapers, sufficiently dumbed-down, in plainer
English, and with noticeably more spin in place of the straight-forward
frankness of pieces like "Which Path to Persia?"
Consider Kenneth Pollack, co-author of
"Which Path to Persia?," then penning this fluff piece, "Iran's Covert
War Against the US" for the Daily Beast.
Below that is your corporate-media propaganda which is almost entirely
useless and also the most widely viewed by the greatest number of
people. Those that believe anything they see on CNN or Fox are generally
unaware that organizations like Brookings even exist - despite their
"experts" often being brought on for commentary & analysis.
As much as the alternative media has grown, a tremendous amount of
ordinary people have still never heard of PNAC, Agenda 21, Brookings
(let alone any specific work of theirs) and so on.
Also keep in mind that "Which Path to
Persia?" while being incredibly frank and incriminating, is not
necessarily the pinnacle manifestation of their conspiracy which most
likely would not be "public." However, human nature being what it is -
we can take what they do make known, and what human history has already
taught us and extrapolate what indeed they are really up to and why.
I am acutely aware of a possible strategy of tension created by
dictating the tempo & nature of global conflict by publicly releasing
apparent intentions - then again the global elite of Wall Street and
London really are subverting governments with US/UK funded NGOs and
there is a paper trail overtly, publicly proving it.
Since these NGOs are defended publicly as
doing "humanitarian" work when targeted governments crackdown on them,
they must show where their funding comes from and appear, at least to
the ignorant, as legitimate.
Despite both governments - the aggressor and
the besieged - knowing the truth, the fact that so many gullible people
don't understand that
the "National Endowment for Democracy" is actually
a corporate fascist front, tips the balance of power in favor of the
greater propagandist - Wall Street/London.
Of course, the only thing we can ever be sure of is ourselves, our
family and friends, and people in our immediate community.
That is why facing the vast landscape of
geopolitics and a means of implementing change across it is better off
being started in your own backyard, on your own block, and in your own
community.
It is easy to identify those in society who
have acquired unwarranted influence, and just as easy in many cases to
immediately begin boycotting and replacing them with local solutions.
