# NSA Secretly Exploited Devastating Heartbleed Bug for Years - Report

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_nsa82.htm

No matter how hard you try to stay safe, some
aspects of securing your online data are completely out of your hands.
That fact was made painfully obvious on Monday,
when the Internet got caught with its collective pants down thanks to a
critical vulnerability affecting a fundamental tool for secure online
communications.
Called
Heartbleed, the bug has been in the wild for more than two years now. It
allows attackers to exploit a critical programming flaw in OpenSSL - an open
source implementation of the SSL/TLS encryption protocol.
When exploited, the flaw leaks data from a
server's memory, which could include SSL site keys, usernames and passwords,
and even personal user data such as email, instant messages, and files,
according to Finland-based Codenomicon, the security firm that first
uncovered Heartbleed in concert with a Google researcher.
That's bad. Real bad, though it's important to
note that Heartbleed only affects OpenSSL and not the security protocol
itself.
But due to OpenSSL's popularity with website
administrators, the potential number of affected websites is huge. Security
and Internet research firm Netcraft estimates that Heartbleed affects around
half a million "widely
trusted websites."
Yahoo has already said it was hit by the
Heartbleed bug and
Yahoo-owned Tumblr is advising users to update their passwords ASAP.
"On the scale of 1 to 10, this [Heartbleed]
is an 11," respected security expert
Bruce Schneier said on his blog.
Yes, this bug is pretty serious and almost
certainly affects at least one of your online accounts.
But now that we've got the scary stuff out of
the way, let's talk about some of the practical measures you need to know
about.
Keep calm and...
Thanks to Hearbleed it's possible that some
unscrupulous actors online could have your username and password. And you
should definitely change your password on any site that says it was
affected.
But here's the thing:
While OpenSSL already has a fix available,
changing your username and password before a site patches its
servers achieves nothing.
In fact, it could make things worse.
"You should change password after
the service provider has patched their site. Otherwise you just
contribute to the data that can be stolen," Codenomicon spokesperson Ari
Takanen told us via email.
...don't carry on
Heartbleed was publicized on Monday.
So by now, many sites should have scrambled (or
are scrambling) to patch their servers. You can find out if a site is still
affected by Heartbleed using online checkers provided by
LastPass,
Qualsys, or
Filippo Valsorda.
If you find that a site you use often is still
affected by the vulnerability, Codenomicon advises to take a "day off" from
that site.
Heartbleed only exposes data that's held in a
server's memory (RAM). This isn't a break-in and read the database type
flaw. Your data needs to be in a server's memory when it's attacked to be
exposed.
That's one reason why changing your password
before a site is patched could actually be worse than doing nothing,
especially now that Heartbleed is public knowledge.
Other considerations
Security flaws like this are also a good time
for some reminders about how best to secure your online accounts.
You should really be using two-factor
authentication for all your accounts that offer it. Two-factor
authentication requires you to enter an extra code before accessing your
online accounts.
The code is typically generated by a smartphone
app or keychain dongle, but you can also receive codes to your phone via SMS.
This extra step requires attackers to know how to generate your two-factor
authentication code before they can login to your account.
In the case of Heartbleed, two-factor
authentication may not have been as useful a defense, but in general this
extra step helps keep your account safer than it was.
Use a password manager
Now's a good time to start using a password
manager especially if you're going to be changing some user logins over the
next few days.
A password manager makes it easy to generate
randomized passwords using a combination of letters, numbers, and special
characters. It also relieves you of having to memorize every one of those
overly complex codes.
Password managers often come with other features
as well such as secure notes, and autofill for online forms.
There are many options out there for password
managers, but some of our favorites include
LastPass,
Dashlane, and
KeePass.
LastPass recently said in a
blog post that it was using the version of OpenSSL affected by
Heartbleed; however, because the service encrypts your data before
transmitting it online, the company says its users were not at risk of
having their data exposed to the bad guys.
Heartbleed is certainly a nasty little bug that
needs to be taken seriously. But considering it's been in the wild for more
than two years, there's not much a user can do now except wait patiently for
affected sites to patch their servers before changing any passwords.
Once those sites are patched, however, you'll
want to change your password as soon as possible.
Critical OpenSSL 'Heartbleed' Bug Puts...
Encrypted Communications at Risk
by Jeremy Kirk
April 8, 2014
from
PCWorld Website
Computer security experts are advising
administrators to patch a severe flaw in a software library used by millions
of websites to encrypt sensitive communications.
The flaw, nicknamed "Heartbleed," is contained
in several versions of
OpenSSL, a
cryptographic library that enables SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS
(Transport Security Layer) encryption. Most websites use either SSL or TLS,
which is indicated in browsers with a padlock symbol.
The flaw, which was introduced in December 2011,
has been fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1g, which was released on Monday.
The vulnerable versions of OpenSSL are 1.0.1
through 1.0.1f with two exceptions: OpenSSL 1.0.0 branch and 0.9.8,
according to a special
website set up
by researchers who found the problem.
If exploited, the flaw could allow attackers to
monitor all information passed between a user and a Web service or even
decrypt past traffic they've collected.
"This allows attackers to eavesdrop
communications, steal data directly from the services and users and to
impersonate services and users," the researchers wrote.
The bug was discovered by three researchers from
Codenomicon, a computer security
company, and Neel Mehta, who works on security for Google.
The scope of the problem is vast, as many modern
operating systems are suspected as having an affected OpenSSL version.
Operating systems that may have a vulnerable
version of OpenSSL include,
-
Debian Wheezy
-
Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS
-
CentOS 6.5
-
Fedora 18
-
OpenBSD 5.3
-
FreeBSD 8.4
-
NetBSD 5.0.2
-
OpenSUSE 12.2,
...they
wrote.
The "oldstable" versions of Debian Squeeze and
Suse Linux Enterprise Server are not vulnerable.
OpenSSL also underpins two of the most widely
used Web servers, Apache and nginx. The code library is also used to protect
email servers, chat servers, virtual private networks and other networking
appliances, they wrote.
The problem, CVE-2014-0160, is a missing bounds
check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension, which can then be used
to view 64K of memory on a connected server, according to another
advisory.
It allows attackers to obtain the private keys
used to encrypt traffic. With those keys, it is also possible for attackers
to decrypt traffic they've collected in the past.
The attackers can only access 64K of memory
during one iteration of the attack, but the attackers can "keep reconnecting
or during an active TLS connection keep requesting arbitrary number of 64
kilobyte chunks of memory content until enough secrets are revealed,"
according to the website.
It's unclear if attackers have been exploiting
the flaw over the last two years, which was just publicly revealed on
Monday. But attacks using the flaw "leaves no traces of anything abnormal
happening to the logs," the researchers wrote.
Administrators are advised to apply the
up-to-date version of SSL, revoke any compromised keys and reissue new keys.
