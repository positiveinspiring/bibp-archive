TRUE DEMOCRACY SUMMER 2001 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Financial Department
Federal Reserve System
Cartel of private banks overseen by elite superwealthy
financiers, such as the
Rockefellers, Mellons, DuPonts,
Rothschilds, etc.,
which dictates to the Government the flow of money, worth of money, and the
interest rates.
According to the Kennedy assassination researcher, a man named Claude Manor,
who researched the Kennedy assassination for 34 years, President Kennedy knew
that the Federal Reserve Bank is a privately owned bank. John F. Kennedy was
going to give the Treasury the power to issue Silver Certificates against
Silver bullion, silver or any Standard Silver Dollars in the Tresury. The
EO#11110 [Executive Order] could have prevented the National Debt. from getting
to where it is today. The reason for this is obvious. If
enough Silver Certificates are in circulation, they would eliminate the need
for Federal Reserve notes. This is because the Silver Certificates
are backed by Silver, and the Federal Reserve Notes are not backed by anything.
For this reason alone we must disband the Federal Reserve System and the
Federal Reserve Notes and mandate either silver certificates or gold certificates
to back the dollar now. This is better late than never as the elites would
have it.
