Supposedly warnings about the latent
inflationary threat posed by simply ridiculous non-financial debt levels (as
presented most recently here yesterday), not to mention financial debt
(which as MF Global's rehypothecated implosion demonstrated so vividly can
be any number between minus and plus infinity, thank you London
"regulators") from the blogosphere can be ignored ($15 trillion melting ice
cube that is shadow banking which also doubles as the best inflationary
buffer known to man, notwithstanding).
After all, what does the blogosphere know:
remember, Libor has been repeatedly proven to not be manipulated, as the
mainstream media so sternly claimed year after year after year until it had
no choice but to do a 180 and pretend its advertiser paid for lies in the
past 3 years never existed.
But when these same warnings emanate from the
"very serious people" at UBS, economists with a Ph.D. at that, it may be a
little more difficult to dismiss them.
So here it is: "Hyperinflation Revisited" from
Caesar Lack, PhD, economist.
From UBS, highlights ours.
Global Risk Watch -
Hyperinflation Revisited
Hyperinflation:
Paper money only has a value
because of the confidence that the money can be exchanged for a certain
quantity of goods or services in the future.
If this confidence is
eroded, hyperinflation becomes a threat. If holders of cash start to
question the future purchasing power of the currency and switch into
real assets, asset prices start to rise and the purchasing power of
money starts to fall.
Other cash holders may realize the falling
purchasing power of their money and join the exit from paper into real
assets. When this self-reinforcing cycle turns into a panic, we have
hyperinflation. The classic examples of hyperinflation are Germany in
the 1920s, Hungary after the Second World War, and Zimbabwe, where
hyperinflation ended in 2009.
Indeed, hyperinflation is not that rare at
all. Economist Peter Bernholz has identified no fewer than 28 cases of
hyperinflation in the 20th century.
Our monthly global inflation barometer tracks
the risks to our global inflation outlook as part of our Global risk watch
series.
Apart from deflation and high inflation, we identify hyperinflation
as a third risk to our view of moderate global inflation rates. We currently
see it as very unlikely that any of these three risk scenarios will
materialize over the next 12 months, i.e. we estimate their probability at
below 10%. However, given the devastating effects hyperinflation would have,
we want to explore the risk of hyperinflation in more detail.
Hyperinflation has little to do with "normal" price inflation. In
particular, hyperinflation is not an escalation of "normal" inflation.
"Normal" inflation denotes a steady and continuous decline in the purchasing
power of money, which is ultimately attributable to an increase in the money
supply.
Hyperinflation, on the other hand, is a collapse of confidence in money,
which results in an accelerating flight out of money into real assets and
goods, and thus an accelerating loss of the purchasing power of money.
Hyperinflation is a
fiscal phenomenon
Ultimately, hyperinflation is a fiscal phenomenon; that is, hyperinflation
results from unsustainable fiscal deficits.
Peter Bernholz notes that
historically, cases of hyperinflation have been preceded by the central bank
monetizing a significant proportion of the government deficit.
After
investigating 29 hyperinflationary episodes, 28 of which happened in the
20th century, Bernholz writes:
"We draw the conclusion that the creation of
money to finance a public budget deficit has been the reason for
hyperinflation."
When government deficits become unsustainable, austerity is often the first
reaction.
Austerity is deflationary, recessionary, and painful. If the
austerity necessary to balance the budget is deemed to be too painful, a
government can either choose to default or to inflate the currency.
If the country concerned has its own currency, it will usually choose to
inflate it. If government finances do not improve sufficiently, confidence
in the currency may evaporate at some point and hyperinflation may arise.
Hyperinflation is more closely related to deflation than to "normal" high
inflation, as hyperinflation can be viewed as the result of a failed attempt
at printing money to avoid the deflation that would be caused by austerity.
In our view, there is some risk that hyperinflation could arise in one or
more large currencies.
As a consequence of the burst credit bubble, we are
seeing unsustainable government deficits in many large countries.
Deleveraging and austerity are deflationary and recessionary. Central banks
around the world are fighting these deflationary and recessionary tendencies
by massively easing monetary policy.
Having exhausted the interest rate
instrument, global central banks are increasingly turning to the alternative
measures of
quantitative and qualitative easing. While direct
government debt monetization by central banks is still the exception, the
elaborate toolbox of central banks allows for indirect debt monetization,
for example, by accepting government bonds as collateral in temporary but
repeated operations.
In the two following sections, we illustrate the
current unsustainable developments in global fiscal and monetary policy.
Government debt rising at an unsustainable speed In the wake of
the financial crisis of 2008, government deficits increased massively around the
world. However, despite widespread commitments to austerity, government
deficits are still at unsustainable levels (see Fig. 1).
According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates, the combined
government net borrowing of the world's 10 largest deficit countries will
amount to USD 2.657 trn (or 5.9% of GDP on average) in 2012, half of which
is due to the US alone.
The 2012 deficits are only slightly lower than the
deficits in the three previous post-crisis years.
Before the financial
crisis (19902007), average net borrowing of the Top 10 deficit countries
amounted to 3.7% of GDP; from 20092012, net borrowing climbed to 7.4% on
average. Average annual nominal GDP growth since 1990 has amounted to 5% in
these countries.
In order to be sustainable, i.e. in order for a country's
government debt/GDP ratio to decline, its deficit must fall below the
nominal growth rate of GDP. Given the current low growth and inflation
environment, the deficits would actually have to fall significantly below
the 5% mark in order to stabilize the debt/GDP ratio.
Note that the 2012 IMF
forecast of a net borrowing of 5.9% for the 10 high-deficit countries could
well turn out to be too optimistic, as the recent negative economic news has
worsened the fiscal outlook.
Global monetary policy
expansion accelerated
Fig. 2 illustrates the accelerating expansion of monetary policy after the
financial crisis of 2008.
In the years leading up to the collapse of Lehman
(20022008), the global monetary base grew at an average annual rate of
10.5% (in local currencies, weighted by GDP). Since
the Lehman collapse, the
average annual growth of the global monetary base has more than doubled to
21.6%.
Currently, the global monetary base amounts to USD 14.1 trn and is up
20.4% on the previous year.
Fig. 3 shows the global monetary policy expansion and the combined net
borrowing of the Top 10 deficit countries.
In fact, in 2011, the global
central bank balance sheet and the global monetary base expansion were about
equal to the deficit countries' combined net borrowing.
Although central
banks do not directly monetize government deficits (with some exceptions),
one can argue that central banks are at least accommodating the current
excessive governments deficits.
Neither the government deficits of many large countries nor the speed of the
current global monetary policy expansion are sustainable. If government
finances do not improve and the global monetary policy expansion is not
halted in time, hyperinflation could set in.
However, it is not clear how
much fiscal and monetary policy can expand before a loss of confidence in
paper money sets in.
Countries at risk
Bernholz notes that preceding a case of hyperinflation, government deficits
usually amount to more than 20% of government expenditures, and that
deficits amounting to 40% or more of government expenditures clearly cannot
be maintained.
Of the Top 10 deficit countries,
-
India
-
the U.S.
-
Japan
-
Spain
-
the UK,
...all
exhibit government net borrowing above 20% of government expenditures (Table
1). However, Spain does not have its own currency and therefore cannot
trigger hyperinflation on its own.
The government net borrowing of the Eurozone as a whole amounts to only 11% of total government expenditures.
The euro is therefore not a prime candidate for hyperinflation, as long as
the core countries do not leave the currency union.
Although India is one of
the Top 10 deficit countries, an outbreak of hyperinflation there would be
of relatively minor concern to the global investor. Unlike the US and the
UK, Japan is a creditor nation and not a debtor nation.
In fact, Japan has
the world's largest net international investment position (see Fig. 4),
while the US is the world's largest net debtor.
We think that a creditor
nation is less at risk of hyperinflation than a debtor nation, as a debtor
nation relies not only on the confidence of domestic creditors, but also of
foreign creditors.
We therefore think that the hyperinflation risk to global
investors is largest in the US and the UK.
Indicators to watch
The more the fiscal situation deteriorates and the more central banks debase
their currencies, the higher the risk of a loss of confidence in the future
purchasing power of money.
Indicators to watch in order to determine the
risk of hyperinflation therefore pertain to the fiscal situation and
monetary policy stance in high-deficit countries. Note that current
government deficits and the current size of central bank balance sheets are
not sufficient to indicate the sustainability of the fiscal or monetary
policy stance and thus, the risk of hyperinflation.
The fiscal situation can
worsen without affecting the current fiscal deficit, for example when
governments assume contingent liabilities of the banking system or when the
economic outlook worsens unexpectedly.
Similarly, the monetary policy stance
can expand without affecting the size of the central bank balance sheet.
This happens for example when central banks lower collateral requirements or
monetary policy rates, in particular the interest rate paid on reserves
deposited with the central bank.
A significant deterioration of the fiscal
situation or a significant expansion of the monetary policy stance in the
large-deficit countries could lead us to increase the probability we assign
to the risk of hyperinflation.
Gold - the canary in
the coalmine
Due to its long standing as the foremost, non-inflatable, liquid alternative
currency, gold is the first destination for wealth fleeing from paper money
into real assets.
Gold can be considered a hyperinflation hedge, and its
price can be considered an indicator for the probability of hyperinflation.
A sudden rise in the price of gold would be a warning sign that the risk of
hyperinflation is increasing, in particular if it went along with a
worsening of the fiscal situation in the deficit countries and an easing of
monetary policy.
Not only gold, but also other commodities, as well as the
stock market, would profit from investors fleeing from money and from
government debt.
Thus a strong rise of gold, commodities, and stock markets,
accompanied by a fall in the currency and in government bond prices (i.e. a
rise in yields) could signal the approach of hyperinflation.
We will
continue to monitor global inflation developments and change our risk
assessment in the global inflation monitor according to current events.
