Do not be confused...
Globalists whether Wall Street capitalists, corporatists, collectivist authoritarians or devoted internationalists, all share a common mindset - a worldwide financial system must control commerce and dictate economic activity.
Under this formula, trade has little to do with free market transactions. Monopolies are the rule and real competition is fatal.
So when the financial press emphasizes the difference between the IMF - World Bank faction and the newly aligned BRICS association, the conclusion usually misses and ignores that all the players are part of a globalist cabal committed to a New World Order.
Trade wars are diversionary skirmishes performing a skit of musical chairs vying for an improved method to destroy national independence and domestic economies.
The by word, interdependency has been sold as a heretical religion.
Almost a year ago an essay, The BRICS - Challengers to the Global Status Quo made the case that the BRICS economic alliance to the western financial establishment could pose as a real alternative model to the international institutions that control world trade.
However, the author Walden Bello also acknowledged the following:
"The BRICS have been among the key beneficiaries of corporate-driven globalization, owing their rise to the marriage between global capital and cheap labor that has followed the fuller integration of formerly non-capitalist or dependent capitalist countries into the global capitalist system over the last 30 years. This union was among the factors that kept up the rate of profit and raised global capitalism out of its crisis of stagnation in the 1970s and 1980s. Make no mistake: the BRICS are capitalist regimes - albeit with large central apparatuses capable of controlling workers."

Make no mistake: the BRICS are capitalist regimes - albeit with large central apparatuses capable of controlling workers."
Mr. Bello proposes that the future of the BRICS could go in two directions.
"One option is for the BRICS to become more integrated with each other and with other developing country economies, along the lines of the 'South-South Trade' or 'South-South Cooperation' strategies that have long been propounded by many progressive economists. Further integration is one of the key topics in the BRICS summits that now take place every two years. The other solution, which the BRICS elites are not too enthusiastic about, is for the BRICS to adopt policies aimed at radically reducing income inequality and thus creating vibrant domestic markets. This would involve no less than promoting a social revolution in these countries, since powerful interest groups have congealed around the current economic regimes."

The Asia pivot in geo-political terms feeds into the emergence of the BRICS shift in institutional evolution.
Europe's Smart Asian Pivot provides a case to advance trade agreements that only benefit globalist elites, while sucking the very essence out of national economies.
"The E.U. must engage with Asia on at least three mutually beneficial fronts, with trade being the most important. The trade-liberalization agreements that the E.U. has in the pipeline with Asia's vibrant economies (including South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Vietnam, Japan, and Thailand) are more ambitious in scope than previous bilateral deals. As large-scale regional free-trade arrangements take shape, the E.U. continues to signal unequivocal commitment to free trade through sophisticated bilateral agreements."

The end result is more consolidation under a Chinese prototype of a corporate/state/NWO system. The robber barons of the 19th century would be filled with envy by the degree of financial mastery that has been imposed.
In keeping with the rash of trade agreements that are unremittingly being pushed on the world, Forbes reports on the Leaked TISA Documents Reveal Privacy Threat.
Remember that every component of these trade agreements is designed to tighten the noose on consumers and their natural rights.
"Under the draft provisions of the latest trade deal to be leaked by Wikileaks, countries could be barred from trying to control where their citizens' personal data is held or whether it's accessible from outside the country.
Wikileaks has released 17 documents relating to the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), currently under negotiation between the US, the European Union and 23 other nations. These negotiating texts are supposed to remain secret for five years after TISA is finalized and brought into force.
The deal, which has been under discussion behind closed doors since early 2013, is intended to remove barriers to trade in services. It's a sort of companion piece to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which cover trade in goods - but potentially far bigger, with Wikileaks claiming that 'services' now account for nearly 80 per cent of the US and EU economies."

Read the full details in this Trade in Services Agreement.
WikiLeaks releases today 17 secret documents from the ongoing TISA (Trade In Services Agreement) negotiations which cover the United States, the European Union and 23 other countries including,
Turkey Mexico Canada Australia Pakistan Taiwan Israel,
Turkey
Mexico
Canada
Australia
Pakistan
Taiwan
Israel,
...which together comprise two-thirds of global GDP.
"Services" now account for nearly 80 per cent of the US and EU economies and even in developing countries like Pakistan account for 53 per cent of the economy.
While the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has become well known in recent months in the United States, the TISA is the larger component of the strategic TPP-TISA-TTIP 'T-treaty trinity'.
All parts of the trinity notably exclude the 'BRICS' countries of,
Brazil Russia India China South Africa
Brazil
Russia
India
China
South Africa

While, service category agreements may not receive the same coverage as manufacturing, it should be noted that incorporating global regulations upon all these segments of commerce will force radical internationalist interference into every aspect of our economy.
Now if you think that BRICS nations will abide under these same standards, you must be a "true believer" in the international community. America has been sold short by brand named companies that only sell their products, produced and shipped from overseas facilities.
This next example proves this point.
Nike-backed group pushes Trans-Pacific Partnership in Oregon is shameless in its disingenuous deceit.
"Faced with a backlash from members of his party's liberal base as well as skepticism from some fiscal conservatives over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), President Barack Obama recently traveled to Nike's world headquarters in Oregon, promising new jobs for American workers. The shoe and apparel behemoth currently produces around 96 percent of its footwear in Southeast Asia, according to a National Journal review of the company's SEC filings. It has been a supporter of the proposed trade deal and the fast track authority it grants the president to speed negotiations, which the company claims could help it create 10,000 new American jobs."

Let's get real. Nike is a prime globalist supporter that markets overpriced stylish sneakers to ignorant trendy consumers.
Such an economy may work for BRICS environments, but is absolutely destructive to our country.
It might be helpful if the BRICS alliance would actually offer a constructive alternative to the IMF, WTO and World Bank system, but the linkage between the two "so called" trading systems are both dedicated to a controlled global economy.
Thus, the passage of caustic international trade agreements only hastens the day of our own demise and the emergence of more foreign intrusion into our internal business.
Aspects of an actual trade war is less about competition between established and up and coming factions, then about who will become, or remain, dominate as an economic power and financial system.
As long as the globalists are writing the rules and refuse to allow legitimate free enterprise to thrive, the prospects for worldwide prosperity are nil.
You should be well aware that the lack of transparency is the hallmark of international trade agreements. Likewise, the mantra of "Free Trade" policy is a pseudo version of real voodoo economics.
Review the article, Right and Left Agree - TPP about Corporate Control for more in-depth information.
If a loss of financial liberty is incidental, you are entering paradise. However, if you retain even a semblance of self-respect, become vocal with your opposition on all these phony trade agreements.
Without involvement the rot of this reign of terror will spread into every corner of the economy.
The rightful trade war that needs to be fought is against the global corporatists.
Return to The BRICS
Return to American "Empire"
Return to Globalization and The European Union
