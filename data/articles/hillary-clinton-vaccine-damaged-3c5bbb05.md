Severe Brain Damage Symptoms
Suffered by former Secretary of State
Revealed in New Book.
A new book astonishingly claims that Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton is suffering from a plethora of health issues, leading some to believe that perhaps she is unfit to lead the country. According to excerpts from the book 'Unlikeable - The Problem with Hillary' that were published by Radar Online, 67-year-old Clinton has been "frequently plagued" by "blinding headaches" and even small strokes over the course of her campaign, ailments that have left her second-guessing her chances of winning the presidency in 2016.
"For the first time I've known her, she's showing self-doubt about her strength and vitality," a friend of Clinton's told author Edward Klein, who has penned tomes about the Obamas and Kennedys previously.
The Democratic frontrunner - who has been slipping in some polls for months - has also been dealing with bouts of insomnia that have,
"worried her, because it sapped her energy just when she needed it most for the campaign," writes Klein. "She is exhausted and depressed a lot of the time," according to a friend who is not named but quoted, adding that Clinton has even resorted to taking sleeping pills to deal with the problem, but they have not been helping. "She said they made her less sharp the next day," the friend said.
In late 2012, Clinton suffered from a life-threatening blood clot in her brain that has since left her "constantly worried" she will eventually have to deal with another one, Edward Klein asserts. For her part, Clinton says she's in great health and has released a letter from her doctor over the summer alleging her fitness. As noted by the New York Post:
Dr. Lisa Bardack of Mount Kisco, NY, outlined Clinton's medical history, which included her treatment for a brain concussion, an analysis of blood clots affecting her legs and brain on separate occasions, an underactive thyroid gland examination, and a complete family history of heart disease.
Klein, however, says Clinton is really just keeping her ailments a secret - like her emails when she served as Secretary of State.
"There were incidents on the campaign trail when she felt faint and nearly swooned," he claimed. "Those incidents were kept secret."
According to Radar Online, an insider says that Clinton's closest aide, Huma Abedin, even sleeps in her room to keep a closer eye on her.
The site noted:
Clinton has a history of blackouts, falls, memory loss, blinding headaches, vision problems and collapses dating back at least a decade. In 2005, she fainted during a luncheon speech in Buffalo, N.Y. Four years later, thenSecretary of State Clinton broke her right elbow in a mysterious fall in a U.S. State Department garage. In 2011, Clinton collapsed while boarding a flight in Yemen, but insisted she'd simply slipped.

As reported, Clinton is also exhibiting all the signs of vaccine poisoning, which can cause brain damage. In an interview over the summer during what her spokespeople billed as a "listening tour" in New Hampshire, Clinton seemed more like someone stricken with a medical condition than a potential leader who was interested in what people have to say. A below video of Clinton sitting with a half-dozen "everyday Americans" at a children's toy and furniture factory shows her uttering the phrase, "uh-huh" a whopping 88 times:
The response appeared to be "a nervous tic" that the former first lady and U.S. senator from New York has developed, The Daily Caller observed. Is this who we really want to control the military, decide whether or when to use nuclear weapons, deal with foreign leaders and trust to make leadership decisions that are in our country's best interests?
