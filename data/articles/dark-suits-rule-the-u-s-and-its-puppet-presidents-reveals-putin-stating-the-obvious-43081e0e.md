Vladimir Putin
states aloud what aware people have come to realize:
the dark suits of the NWO make up the Deep State
and rule the U.S. & its puppet presidents.
Dark suits run the U.S. and whatever figurehead puppet president that gets installed in the White House.
The same goes for many countries, including Russia, the home of President Vladimir Putin himself.
However, there is something distinctly and extraordinarily entrenched about the Shadow Government, Parallel Government or Deep State in the USA, which is of course what Putin was referring to in the below video.

The dark suits are the unelected bureaucracy or true ruling class that stays in office no matter which party on the spectrum is temporarily in power.
The dark suits are the international bankers. The dark suits are the mighty MIC (Military Intelligence Complex), the sprawling collection of 16 agencies (including the nefarious NSA and CIA, lesser known but still massive agencies like the DIA and NGA, and ominous agencies like the NRO [whose mission patches proudly proclaim mottos like "We Own the Night"]).
The diabolical influence of these dark suits can already be seen in the first 100 days of the Trump presidency, e.g. in the disgraceful ways Trump has flip-flopped more than a fish out of water on a multitude of issues.
Those aware of how the game works can see that the dark suits have already got to Trump.
In a recent interview (May 30th 2017, above video) with French media outlet Le Figaro, Putin joked about those in dark suits telling every successive and incoming U.S. presidential administration exactly what to do:
"You know, I've communicated with one U.S. president, and with the second, and with the third presidents come and go but the politics remains the same. Do you know why that is? Because the bureaucracy has a lot of power. So a person is elected, he comes with his ideas. Then people with briefcases come to visit him - well dressed, in dark suits, kind of like mine. Except instead of a red tie it's black or navy. And then they explain what to do, and the whole rhetoric changes, you see? This happens from one administration to the next."

The dark suits ensure the agenda, the New World Order agenda of a globalized central dictatorship with a,

...always stays on course no matter which puppet is in power.
The ever eastwards-expanding NATO,
who recently absorbed Montenegro into its ranks.
But it's purely for defense right?

Putin also remarked on NATO's internal contradictions:
"What interested me, from the recent NATO summit, is that they stated that they wished to improve relations with Russia. Why then increase the defense budget? Who are you going to war against? There are some internal contradictions here - but it's none of our business. You decide within NATO who should be paid and how much - we're not worried about it. We look after our own defense capability, we do it well and with a vision for the future. We are assured in ourselves."

Like Government in general, NATO needs an enemy in order to justify its own existence.
Logically, that enemy has to be Russia, since NATO has already absorbed many Western and Atlantic nations into its organization. It just gobbled up Montenegro in the Balkans to ensure Russia doesn't get too much of a foothold there.
In the beginning, NATO was set up to stop the spread of Soviet communism into the West via Europe. If Western leaders suddenly embraced Russia and begin to cooperate with it rather than demonize it, NATO would become irrelevant and, dare I say it obsolete.
Speaking of obsolete, remember what Trump said about NATO and "obsolete"?

Trump:
"NATO is no longer obsolete"
(after the dark suits spoke to him)
So it suits the Western leaders of the world right now to continue propagating the myth of the grave "Russian threat", both,
for foreign policy (justifies military spending, buildup and wars) for domestic policy (justifies more draconian surveillance and laws in the name of stopping "Russian interference" in the election, as famously happened in the U.S. but also cropped up in France)

A constant theme of Putin's message for over a decade now has been for the nations of the world to unite against terrorism:
"First you invent [the mythical Russian threat], then you scare yourselves on this basis formulate policy. This kind of policy has no future - there is only a future in a policy of cooperation across all spheres, including security. The main security threat in the world today is what? Terrorism. They blow up Europe; in Paris, in Russia, in Belgium. There is a war in the Middle East. This is what we should be thinking about, but here we are debating the threat that Russia poses."

The dark suits:
they've sold their souls and
(as Dutch whistleblower Ronald Bernard says)
frozen their consciences at -100Â°
to become devoid of humanity and empathy.
History repeats itself, because we subconsciously and unconsciously create similar scenarios in the outer world based on our underlying inner psychological states.
Paul Craig Roberts recently wrote (Van Cliburn: America's Greatest Diplomat) about how other previous U.S. and Russian presidents had to contend and struggle with their respective bureaucracies and military men who thrived on suspicion, fear and war, rather than cooperation, trust and peace.
He writes:
"Khrushchev achieved the de-Stalinization of Russia and worked with U.S. President John F. Kennedy to defuse the Cuban Missile Crisis. Their cooperation opened an end to the Cold War. However, hardliners in both countries removed both leaders from office, thus condemning the world to the ever present risk of nuclear Armageddon The Zionist neoconservatives and the military/security complex have succeeded in destroying the accomplishment of Reagan and Gorbachev, and have resurrected the prospect of nuclear Armageddon."

Presidents and prime ministers have a hard job in many ways.
The hardest aspect may well be resisting the urge of the dark suits around them to constantly feed the fear, create new enemies, inject life into old enemies and play the game of separation politics.
It seems in Putin there is a leader who is genuinely prepared and able to go beyond those childish games and strive for cooperation and peace.
Is Trump mature and strong enough for that task?
Being a bully shows weakness of character; building a relationship of mutual trust and cooperation requires strength.
