For years, Internet advocates have warned of the
doomsday scenario that will play out on Monday:
Google and Verizon will announce a deal that
the New York Times reports, "could
allow Verizon to speed some online content to Internet users more
quickly if the content's creators are willing to pay for the privilege."
The deal marks the beginning of the end of the
Internet as you know it.
Since its beginnings, the Net was a level
playing field that allowed all content to move at the same speed, whether
it's ABC News or your uncle's video blog. That's all about to change, and
the result couldn't be more bleak for the future of the Internet, for
television, radio and independent voices.
How did this happen?
-
We have a Federal Communications
Commission (FCC)
that has been denied authority by the courts to police the
activities of Internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast.
All because of a bad decision by
the Bush-era FCC
-
We have a pro-industry FCC Chairman who
is terrified of making a decision, conducting back room deal-making,
and willing to sit on his hands rather than reassert his agency's
authority.
-
We have a president who promised to
"take a back seat to no one on Net Neutrality" yet remains silent
-
We have a congress that is nearly
completely captured by industry
Yes, more than half of the US congress will do
pretty much whatever the phone and cable companies ask them to.
Add the clout of
Google, and you have near-complete
control of Capitol Hill.
A non-neutral Internet means that companies like AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and
Google can turn the Net into cable TV and pick winners and losers online.
A problem just for Internet geeks? You wish.
All video, radio, phone and other services will
soon be delivered through an Internet connection. Ending Net Neutrality
would end the revolutionary potential that any website can act as a
television or radio network. It would spell the end of our opportunity to
wrest access and distribution of media content away from the handful of
massive media corporations that currently control the television and radio
dial.
So the Google-Verizon deal can be summed up as this:
"FCC, you have no authority over us and
you're not going to do anything about it. Congress, we own you, and
we'll get whatever legislation we want. And American people, you can't
stop us."
This Google-Verizon deal, this
industry-captured FCC, and the way this is playing out is akin to the
largest banks and the largest hedge funds writing the regulatory policy on
derivative trading without any oversight or input from the public, and
having it rubber stamped by
the SEC.
It's like BP and Halliburton ironing out the
rules for offshore oil drilling with no public input, and having
MMS sign
off.
Fortunately, while they are outnumbered, there are several powerful Net
Neutrality champions on Capitol Hill, like,
-
Nancy Pelosi
-
Harry Reid
-
Henry Waxman
-
Jay Rockefeller
-
Ed Markey
-
Jay Inslee,
...and many others.
But they will not be able to turn this tide
unless they have massive, visible support from every American who uses the
Internet - whether it's for news, email, shopping,
Facebook, Twitter - whatever.
So stop what you're doing and tell them you're
not letting the Internet go the way of Big Oil and Big
Banks.
The future of the Internet, and your access to
information depends on it.
Author's note
Notice how a company can change their tune in
the name of profit-making.
From
Google in 2006:
"Today the Internet is an information
highway where anybody - no matter how large or small, how traditional or
unconventional - has equal access.
But the phone and cable monopolies, who
control almost all Internet access, want the power to choose who gets
access to high-speed lanes and whose content gets seen first and
fastest.
They want to build a two-tiered system and
block the on-ramps for those who can't pay."
