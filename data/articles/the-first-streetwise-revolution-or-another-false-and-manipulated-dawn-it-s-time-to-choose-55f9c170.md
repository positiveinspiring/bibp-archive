Any protest, any change or revolution not
founded on the list below - at the very least the list below - has got no
chance of changing anything.
These very pillars of the system must fall or
they will block any transformation of the human condition. The system does
not need to be tinkered with or even fundamentally changed (on the surface).
The whole bloody lot must go... starting with...
-
An end to creating money out of thin air
on computer screens and charging interest on it (fractional reserve
lending).
-
An end to governments borrowing
fresh-air money called credit from private banks and the people
paying interest on this money that has never, does not and will
never exist. Governments (and that concept must change radically)
can create their own currency - interest free.
-
An end to private banks issuing
non-existent money called credit at all and thus creating money
as a debt from the very start.
-
An end to casinos like Wall Street and
the City of London betting mercilessly on the financial and
commodity markets with the lives of billions around the world.
-
An end to all professional lobby groups
that earn their living and their clients living from corrupting the
professionally corruptible - vast numbers of world politicians and
the overwhelming majority on Capitol Hill.
-
An end to no-contract government in
which mendacious politicians can promise the people they will do
this and that to win their support and then do the very opposite
after they have lied themselves into office (see
Obama).
-
An end to the centralization of power in
all areas of our lives and a start to diversifying power to
communities to decide their own lives and thus ensure there are too
many points of decision making for any cabal to centrally control.
That is just for starters. There is so much more where that came from.
What
good will come from rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic? NONE.
The
banking system as we know it does not need to be changed - it needs to
be gone. It is a criminal activity based on fraud, extortion and, through
its effect, on worldwide mass murder.
Its replacement needs to be decided by the population - not the very people
who created it in the first place and are covertly manipulating a new global
structure of financial control based on a world central bank.
Isn't that right, Mr.
Rothschild, Mr.
Rockefeller, Mr.
Soros?
The tail is not wagging the dog - the tail is
wagging the elephant
so many are there in servitude to the few.
