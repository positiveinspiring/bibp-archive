This week President
Barack Obama personally
leads an attempt to persuade the U.S. Congress to authorize a U.S.
militarily attack against the Syrian regime in response to a chemical
weapons attack on rebel held areas in Damascus on August 21.
Casualties range from 355 to 1729 dead,
with three times as many being injured in the attack.
Obama lays
responsibility squarely at the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Obama claims intelligence sources confirm with
'high confidence' that the attack was launched by the regime even if Assad
did not give the order.
This is reflected in a
German Intelligence report that has just
emerged that suggests that the attack was conducted by government forces
without Assads approval.
For many military analysts and independent
observers the timing of the attack raises many troubling questions for the
scenario depicted by Obama.
-
Why would the Assad regime resort to chemical
weapons when it was winning the war using conventional forces?
-
Why
would the regime launch chemical weapons during a visit by United Nations
chemical weapons inspectors?
According to U.S.
Ambassador Samantha
Powers, the attack was timed to show the contempt of the
Assad regime to international norms, and its intent to increasingly use
chemical weapons.
Not so according to the majority of alternative
media sources.
The consensus that has quickly emerged is that it was
Syrian rebels themselves
that launched a
chemical weapons attack on rebel held suburbs in Damascus Syria in a false
flag attack to provoke Western military intervention.
What both President
Obamas administration and the alternative media are not considering is a
shadowy "Third Force" operating in Syria.
There is evidence that a "Third Force" is
operating in Syria that plans to decimate Damascus for an otherworldly "exopolitical"
agenda.
Let me begin by describing this shadowy "Third
Force" which can also be described as the "Hidden Hand" of both world
politics and the relatively new field of exopolitics.
The "Hidden
Hand Dialogue" is a set of questions and answers given by a
self-described Illuminati insider and members of the
Above Top Secret Forum that was recorded in October 2008.
The insider responds to questions in a sincere
and consistent way, and reveals valuable information about the secret
control mechanisms used by an elite group of insiders s/he calls "The
Family".
S/he wrote:
I am a generational member of a Ruling
Bloodline Family
Our Lineage can be traced back beyond antiquity. From
the earliest times of your recorded "history", and beyond, our Family
has been 'directing' the 'play' from behind the scenes, in one way or
another.
Among the many insights s/he gives is that the
leadership of the family is very much aligned with a
group of extraterrestrials that has been on Earth for millennia:
I want to be clear on this Bloodline issue.
The ones you know, they are of earthly lineage. Yes, they have their
place in the Family, but the Real Power lines, do not originate from
this planet.
This echoes the apocryphal
Book of Enoch where a band of 200 fallen
angels/extraterrestrials arrived on Earth and mate with humanity to create a
new bloodline of ruling elites - the Nephilim.
Preston James has just written
an article on Veterans Today describing the Luciferian extraterrestrial
aspects of this "Third Force:"
Some credible insiders have claimed that
most top world leaders have had to enter into a contract with the Third
Force which is really lucifer, the fallen one, the great deceiver of
mankind, who has presented himself as
the Anunnaki Master Controller
Chief Alien ET which is claimed to be an an inter-generational,
inter-dimensional entity that is manipulating the world according to his
alien ET agenda.
The Hidden Hand gave detailed answers to
questions, and made some predictions.
Among these was
the following:
"Damascus, will be uninhabitable by the end
of 2010, possibly even sooner
"
Significantly,
Benjamin Fulford, a former Asia Pacific Bureau chief for
Forbes Magazine, claims that someone with connections to what he describes
as a "criminal cabal"
made a threat in September 2011 that,
"Damascus would be made uninhabitable."
Theres no evidence that Fulford was aware of
what the Hidden Hand had predicted back in 2008, so its a curious
coincidence that the same language was used for claiming that Damascus would
become uninhabitable at some point by a mysterious group of individuals with
great power behind the scenes.
In 2008, such a prediction appeared very
fanciful, and indeed did not occur by the predicted date. Fulfords similar
prediction did not have a timeline but clearly suggested that the coming
devastation was to be contrived by the Third Force/criminal cabal.
Now, however, we are witnessing the Syrian
capital of Damascus being slowly destroyed in an expanding civil war where
indiscriminate aerial bombing and artillery force was initially used by the
government as reported by independent organizations such as
Amnesty International.
As the Assad regime continued its use of
indiscriminate force to cow its opponents into submission and punish
civilians supporting the opposition, its not unrealistic to assume that
Assad would eventually resort to chemical weapons as he lost control of
densely populated urban areas.
In retaliation, rebel units could themselves use
chemical weapons they have gained access to against regime forces and areas,
as Assads regime is now claiming. If chemical weapons were used in a large
scale in Syrias capital by opposing forces, then Damascus could indeed
become uninhabitable in the not too distant future.
The tide of the war, however, changed
dramatically for the Assad regime with an influx of Hezbollah fighters from
Lebanon and Quds Force volunteers from Iran.
Cities and territory that had been held by rebel
forces for months began to fall starting with the border town of
Qusayr in April 2013. So why would Assad resort now to the use of
chemical weapons in Syrias capital city? He most likely didnt as some
press reports are now claiming.
Nor is it feasible that the rebels themselves
would target a rebel held area thereby dealing themselves a significant
tactical military setback.
The most likely culprit is therefore a shadowy
Third Force calling itself "The Family" that desires to escalate the
conflict in Syria and fulfill its own prophesy that Damascus would become
uninhabitable.
The ultimate fate of Damascus will be a sign
that the revelations of the Hidden Hand and Benjamin Fulford were accurate -
the Earth has been controlled by a "Family" or "Criminal Cabal" of ruling
bloodlines with enormous power behind the scenes that manipulates both sides
in international conflicts.
A book by William Bramley, the
Gods of Eden, traces how the Third Force -
he calls them "the custodians" - has historically manipulated both sides of
conflicts to achieve its long term goals.
Numerous witness reports suggest that most
visiting extraterrestrials, however, are not part of the Third Force, and in
fact are in conflict with them. According to multiple contactees and the
Book of Enoch, the Third Force was a criminal band of extraterrestrials
banished to Earth millennia ago.
President Obamas attempt to persuade the U.S.
Congress to authorize military force against Assads regime is facing
heavy resistance and may fail.
More people than ever have become educated by
the alternative news media about false flag events, and strongly suspect
that the chemical weapons attack in Ghouta, Damascus was indeed a false flag
operation.
It was not however an attack launched by the
Assad regime or by the rebels who both had no clear interest in authorizing
such an attack.
Instead, ultimate responsibility lies with the Third Force
which explicitly mentioned years ago that Damascus would in future suffer
from calamitous events that would make it uninhabitable.
We are very likely witnessing the beginning of a
chain of events that may fulfill this dire prophesy.
However, the power of the alternative media to
educate the general public about false flag events and a historic
extraterrestrial presence (exopolitics) is a positive development. It may
culminate in the planned chain of destructive events in Damascus involving
chemical weapons and U.S. intervention not occurring.
There is good reason to believe that the power
of the Third Force to manipulate humanitys fate is being increasingly
exposed, and will eventually come to an end.
