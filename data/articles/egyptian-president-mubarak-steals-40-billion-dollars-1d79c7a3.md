President Mubaraks Steals 40 Billion.
President Mubaraks stash is
worth 40 billion dollars as his personal
worth or what he stole from the Egyptian people has risen to epic
proportions. Mubaraks name can be added to the names of wealthy dictators
throughout the world that most likely received the aide from the United
States in their attempt to affect influence in foreign country politics.
The policy does not seem to be very successful
at this time since the dictators are basically leaving their country
penniless and stealing the money for themselves. The leader of Afghanistan
is another example of a man who is taking the bribes from the US and
amassing his own wealth while his country starves for help.
The overthrow of his 30 years of a dictatorship regime and the military
taking over his corrupt government today January 28, 2011 has army tanks
fighting back protesters but actually many sympathize with the protesters.
Hosni Mubarak has taken real estate, liquid cash, royal yachts, and has 40
billion in cash and assets hidden away in banks around the world for easy
access namely in:
-
Germany
-
United States
-
UK
-
Switzerland
-
Scotland
-
England
-
Dubai
-
Madrid,
...and other countries.
The Alaa Mubarak has properties both inside the
country or in the United States major cities of Washington, LA and New York
on the finest streets of the land. His wife Mrs. Suzanne Mubarak and
their two sons also are incredibly wealthy and the first lady has another
3-5 billion for her own personal use.
Mubaraks wealth also has ties to large
corporate US interests such as:
-
Marlboro
-
Hermes
-
Mcdonalds
-
Vodafone
-
Hyundai
-
Chili,
...and other large corporations.
It is no surprise that the people of Egypt are
starving, jobless and have been robbed of their countries wealth because
President Mubarak and his greedy relatives have stolen all from his own
country.
MUBARAK PERSONAL WEALTH
AT 40 BILLION DOLLARS STOLEN
FROM EGYPT
Today Egyptians said enough is enough and have
taken to the streets 20 thousand strong to oust the 30 years of dictatorship
and corruption. In recent weeks we have seen the same in Tunisia as their
dictator Ali fled the country.
Alis relatives are seeking asylum in a wealth
neighborhood in Montreal Canada.
It is clear that the dictator days in Egypt are over as Mubarak has only one
option and that is to flee his country immediately and allow a democratic
rule to take place.
Editors Note - Jan. 29, 2011
It appears the use of bribery has backfired for
the United States in many examples where the US has attempted to prop up a
dictator who later is thrown out of government by the people.
When the US realizes that the people run a
country and not a puppet government they will use real diplomacy rather than
throwing billions of dollars of so called foreign aid which is essentially
bribery,
JP news, Jouhina Portal News.
How does a low life dictator amass a bundle of cash to the tune of 40
billion dollars? Easy, the US government gave it to him to run the country
as a form of bribery the Americans have propped up this dictator and meddled
yet again in a foreign countrys affairs.
The US must stop the meddling and the bribery
for decades and obviously they have engaged in disturbing the political
balance of Egypt. Bribery does not work since if the man will betray his
country for money, he will betray the lender of the money also. The US has
to stop using bribery as their main focus of influencing political powers in
the Middle East by way of the use of money.
In the long run bribery only gets you so far and
dealing with a ruthless dictator by giving him billions of dollars one would
assume would go into his pocket rather than supporting his country.
Every given country from,
-
Iraq
-
Afghanistan
-
Egypt
-
Tunisia
-
even Haiti,
...that have been receivers of billions of
dollars of aide and incentives have all betrayed the United States by
stealing the money for themselves.
Update
The headquarters of the national democratic
party has been burned to the ground, sources at CNN say the police did the
burning. It appears the army and police are taking the side of the
protesters.
