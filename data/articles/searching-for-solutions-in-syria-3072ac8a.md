For sixteen months, the people of Syria have undergone economic hardship,
tremendous human suffering and the unparalleled horrors of war.
As the Syrian opposition officially abandons the
ceasefire and calls for foreign intervention and the imposition of a no-fly
zone [1], US Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton has announced a
new transition plan that would topple the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, signaling the increasing possibility of intervention
outside the mandate of the United Nations [2].
Following clashes between militant rebel groups
and government forces that claimed the lives of 80 Syrian troops [3],
rebels in Aleppo have reportedly taken 11 hostages and vowed to release them
only when a new state is established [4].
While Bashar al-Assad attributes the
perpetuation of Syrias crisis to outside forces [5], Iran has
expressed its readiness to mount an armed resistance against foreign
military forces in Syria [6].
Regardless of who perpetrated the recent
killings in Qubayr and Houla, the profoundly disturbing images of lifeless
children begs the question, has the Syrian crisis reached a point of
incorrigibility?
Western media has largely relied on unconfirmed opposition accounts
crediting the Shabiha, pro-government Alawite militias with carrying out
massacres across Syria as a result of the Assad government brainwashing the
militia into believing the Sunni majority was their enemy, as
reported by
The Telegraph. [7]
Germanys Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has
recently reported that anti-Assad Sunni militants carried out the massacre
in Houla, targeting pro-government Alawi and Shia minorities,
Those killed were almost exclusively from
families belonging to Houlas Alawi and Shia minorities. Over 90% of
Houlas population is Sunni. Several dozen members of a family were
slaughtered, which had converted from Sunni to Shia Islam.
Members of the Shomaliya, an Alawi family,
were also killed, as was the family of a Sunni member of the Syrian
parliament who is regarded as a collaborator.
Immediately following the massacre, the
perpetrators are supposed to have filmed their victims and then
presented them as Sunni victims in videos posted on the internet.
[8]
Human Rights Watch has also released a report
entitled Syria
- Armed Opposition Groups Committing Abuses, documenting the
outstanding cases of violence exercised by the Syrian opposition, who have
been accused of kidnapping, detaining, torturing and executing of members of
the Syrian military and civilian government supporters [9].
HRW reports that attacks by opposition groups
are conducted largely on sectarian grounds, motivated by anti-Shia and anti-Alawite
sentiments, citing abuses committed by militant Salafist groups and members
of the opposition Free Syrian Army.
Although UN observers admit they are unable to
determine the perpetrators of the recent massacre in Qubayr with no firm
evidence to inculpate the Syrian government, UN chief Ban Ki-moon has
declared that the Assad government has lost its legitimacy [10],
channeling calls by President
Barak Obama, US Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton and British Prime Minister David Cameron for Assad to step down
[11].
Reports of massacres have been framed to fit a pre-determined conclusion, in
line with the foreign policy objectives of Western capitals by implicating
the Assad regime with orchestrating violence in order to build popular
support for aggressively toppling the Syrian government.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
has recently accused external forces of inciting violence by providing arms
and material assistance to militant opposition forces, stating,
They want the international community to be
filled with indignation and start a full-blown intervention in Syria.
[12]
Following the killings in Qubayr, US Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner called on the world to exert "maximum
financial pressure" on Assad's government through strong sanctions that can
help hasten the day the Assad regime relinquishes power," while assuring
that the US would support the use of force against Syria as authorized under
Chapter 7 of the United Nations charter. [13]
Although Hillary Clinton has openly acknowledged that members of Al-Qaeda
and other groups on the State Departments terror list are fighting
alongside opposition rebels supported by the United States [14],
countries belonging to both NATO and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have
provided extensive financial and material support to the militant
opposition.
Former FBI translator turned whistleblower Sibel
Edmonds has reported that NATO/American-affiliated troops have conducted
operations on Jordanian soil near Syrian border in the village of Albaej
[15], as US troops reportedly train members of the Free Syrian
Army along with Jordanian forces in order to prepare them for an
international military drill in the country [16].
Syrian officials report the presence of
intelligence operatives from Mossad and the CIA, as well as employees of
private military contractors such as
Blackwater in Syria; security forces
have reportedly detained French, Turkish, Gulf, Iraqi, and Lebanese gunmen
operating inside Syria. [17]
The Washington Post reports in their article, Syrian rebels get influx of
arms with gulf neighbors money, U.S. coordination, that Persian Gulf
nations such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar with coordination from the United
States have spent millions arming and funding militant opposition groups
battling the Assad government [18].
The United States has admittedly spent $6
million training opposition journalists and activists between 2006 and 2010,
while funneling approximately $6.3 million to the Movement for Justice and
Development, a London-based dissident organization that broadcasts
anti-government news into Syria [19]. As a further indication of foreign
elements at work in Syria, members of the Syrian opposition have also
adopted tactics seen by Al Qaeda in Iraq.
Reuters reports in their article, Outgunned
Syria rebels make shift to bombs, that rebels have adopted suicide bombing,
booby-trapped car bombs and roadside explosions.
Joseph Holliday of the US-based Institute
for the Study of War adds:
"There's no question that a lot of Syrians
fought with al Qaeda elements in Iraq [against the United States] and
it's likely that many rebels today learned bombing skills fighting
there". [20]
While the editorial policy of The New York Times
permits the publication of pieces such as the ostentatiously titled Assad,
the Butcher, which incongruously accuses the foreign ministries of Russia
and China of living in a fantasy world before calling on those nations to
receive comprehensive punishments for being complicit in more than 12,000
Syrian deaths, the Western and Gulf capitals strategy of arming militant
opposition forces and extremist groups has worked to foment atrocities and
further enflame regional sectarian tension, invalidating any attempt to
abide by Kofi Annans Peace Plan. [21]
Publications released by The Brookings
Institution, a US think-tank noted for its influence on American foreign
policy, provides further insight into the nature of Washingtons objectives
in Syria.
Brookings March 2012 Middle East Memo titled
Saving Syria
- Assessing Options for Regime Change, is a testament to the
underlying politicization of the Responsibility to Protect in Syria, as
atrocities are orchestrated as a pretext to protect civilians, to warrant
toppling the Syrian government and furthering Washingtons geopolitical
objectives in the region.
Brookings Memo meticulously theorizes ways to overthrow the Assad
government, including the use of crippling economic sanctions to further
incite unrest and the leveraging of human rights abuses to aggressively
intervene in Syria,
Working with its Arab, regional, and
Western partners, Washington can push for a more effective humanitarian
response and pave the way for more aggressive intervention options to
topple Asad. [22]
Due to budget restraints and a public wary of
fighting wars overseas, Washingtons strategy is to lead from behind by
prompting other countries to lead the charge militarily,
Israel could posture forces on or near the
Golan Heights and, in so doing, might divert regime forces from
suppressing the opposition. This posture may conjure fears in the Asad
regime of a multi-front war, particularly if Turkey is willing to do the
same on its border and if the Syrian opposition is being fed a steady
diet of arms and training. [23]
While Hilary Clinton and others pay lip service
to supporting the ceasefire proposed by the Annan Plan, Brookings advisers
suggest Washington,
pin down the Asad regime and bleed it,
keeping a regional adversary weak, while avoiding the costs of direct
intervention". [24]
The US continues pressuring neighboring
countries like Jordan and Turkey to provide support for the militant Syrian
opposition,
These allies would have to provide secure
bases for the opposition on Syrias borders, protected by their own
armed forces. Their militaries could do much of the arming and training,
in conjunction with the United States. Area intelligence services,
perhaps including Israels, could also work behind the scenes to
undermine Asads regime and bolster the opposition. [25]
Brookings Memo highlights Washingtons
commitment to overthrowing the Syrian government using the most cost-effect
means possible,
the hope is that the United States could
fight a clean war from 10,000 feet and leave the dirty work on the
ground to the Free Syrian Army, perhaps even obviating a massive
commitment to Iraq-style nation-building. [26]
The toppling of the Assad government would offer
the United States and its allies in Tel Aviv and Riyadh substantial
strategic advantages, as the underlying object of supporting insurgent
activity against Damascus is to undermine Iranian influence in the Arab
world.
Syria under Bashar al-Assad is the fundamental
channel that links Hezbollah with Iran, serving as a transit point for
conducting training operations and distributing material assistance to the
Palestinian resistance.
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has
theorized that the toppling of Assad would,
be a major blow to the radical axis [Syria,
Iran, Hezbollah] and a major blow to Iran. It's the only kind of outpost
of Iranian influence in the Arab world and it will weaken dramatically
both Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. [27]
Although Syrias opposition in power after the
downfall of Assad would be a compliant entity to the foreign powers
supporting it, the SNC would likely be unable to conjure the political
leverage needed to enforce order, and heinous violations of human rights
would no doubt occur under it.
If Salafist elements were able to usurp
authority, Syrias Alawite, Druze and Christian populations would likely be
subject to sectarian violence and persecution.
Israel can potentially reap significant gains from regime change in Syria by
working to reduce Irans influence in the region and by increasing its
commercial exploits in Syrias Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which
supplies one-third of Israels water supply [28] and holds an
estimated $24 million in oil and gas reserves. [29]
Over time, resistance movements in Lebanon and
occupied Palestinian territories may be unable to defend their territory
without outside support, allowing the Netanyahu government to more
effectively pursue its aspirations to create a "Greater Israel".
Saudi Arabia is motivated by the prospect of
becoming a dominant regional power and the ideological aspirations of
quelling the expansion of Shia identity through neutralizing the governments
of Tehran and Damascus, as adherents to Sunni Islam recognize Alawites as
part of the Shia sect.
Turkey is also determined to increase its
influence in the region and possibly expand its territory by annexing
northern regions of Syria under appropriate circumstances.
While foreign military intervention would inevitably continue to produce
civilian causalities and collateral damage, it is important to recognize
that the Syrian people have already experienced the spoils of war at this
stage in the conflict. The unspeakable nature of the killings in Syria
inevitably brings one to contemplate how diplomacy can be successfully
utilized given the current state of affairs.
The immediate cessation of violence in Syria
through diplomatic and non-abrasive means should be the ultimate objective
of those individuals charged with enforcing the Annan Plan, even if it means
drastically increasing the presence and financial expenditure of a neutral
United Nations peacekeeping mission.
For all its shortcomings and adherence to
aggressive policies of the United States, Israel, and others,
the United
Nations is the only institution currently established to undertake such a
mission in Syria.
Certain steps can be taken by the international community to ease tensions
at the administrative and grassroots levels, namely by encouraging direct
talks with between Bashar al-Assad and representatives of all internal
opposition organizations, including members of the Free Syrian Army, the
Syrian National Council,
the Muslim Brotherhood and the National
Coordination Committee, a coalition of left-leaning political parties
staunchly opposed to foreign intervention. [30]
Although both the opposition and the Syrian
government have exercised inappropriate and excessive force indiscriminately
throughout the conflict, the government of Bashar al-Assad is the legitimate
legal authority in Syria.
The Assad government has issued reforms allowing
for multi-party competition, the establishment of an independent judiciary,
a two-term limit on the presidency and political pluralism through
inaugurating a new constitution passed in a referendum held in February
2012. If a ceasefire can be upheld through a power-sharing agreement between
representatives of various opposition groups and the current government in
Syria, the international community should rightfully encourage such a
transition.
Furthermore, representatives of the Syrian government and its allies should
have a place at future Friends of Syria meetings and any international
mediation conference to work towards a balanced solution to the crisis.
The United Nations or any other legitimate
neutral institution must investigate the nation states and institutions
responsible for illegally exporting arms into Syria and issue substantial
fines and sanctions to those responsible parties. Neutral institutions must
secure Syrias borders and thoroughly inspect all incoming and outgoing
persons and cargo; in addition, an arms embargo must be established and
respected by all sides with a focus on subduing illegal smuggling.
Both sides must be encouraged to use the maximum
amount of restraint, no matter how severe the provocation. In the case of
successful dialogue between the Assad government and representatives of the
opposition, the creation of UN-administered arms-free zones can be
established in population centers if opposition leaders can be persuaded to
call for the gradual disarmament of rebel forces.
Given the degree of brutality exerted by those responsible for the
atrocities in Houla and elsewhere, it is to be expected that certain
individuals would not respect such a ceasefire; the motivation for their
brutal actions may be sectarian, ideological, or financial.
Neutral external individuals and institutions
could encourage inter-faith dialogues between regional spiritual leaders,
and perhaps influential clerics can be persuaded to issue fatwas or the
equivalent against the further perpetuation of violence in an attempt to
cool sectarian tensions. If the Syrian government and members of the
opposition can come to a conducive transitional agreement where all parties
have a degree of influence, joint security coalitions can be formed
comprised of UN personnel, Syrian soldiers and former rebels to ensure that
the ceasefire is exercised.
Those who act outside the ceasefire using
illegally procured arms and explosives could be individually prosecuted or
dealt with by force if they pose an immediate security threat.
Outside forces must be held accountable for engaging in activities that have
brought the Syrian crisis to this dismal stage, namely by paying substantial
penalties that can be used to temporarily resettle Syrian refugees and fund
efforts to secure Syrias borders.
All efforts must be made to transition the
Syrian people into a climate of normality, including the removal of economic
sanctions. At this crucial stage, the Syrian government should exercise
strict curfews to ensure the safety of civilians, making it more difficult
for terrorist groups to operate. Even if an agreement can be reached between
Bashar al-Assad and representatives of Syrias various opposition groups,
terrorists groups would likely continue to provoke violence for whatever
their purpose.
Until both the Syrian government and the
opposition can unite under the common goal of providing security to the
people of Syria, no viable political transitions can be agreed upon.
The government of Bashar al-Assad must continue to make tangible reforms
that legitimize dissent and promote expression, and the Free Syrian Army
must agree to gradually disarm and come to a political compromise. The
implications of both foreign military intervention and the administrative
usurpation of sectarian fanatics hold unacceptable consequences for the
Syrian people and the entire region.
Even if internal actors agree upon a solution,
it will take years for the people of Syria to recover from this conflict and
begin to forgive each other.
If the majority of Syrian people desire a change
in leadership, the world must respect their aspirations, however such a
decision can only be reached once the domestic security situation has
transitioned to appropriate levels by both sides respecting the ceasefire.
Those individuals who value stability founded on
the pillars of peace, compromise and conflict aversion must make their
voices heard and stand with the Syrian people to help steer them out of
these dark times, and eventually, help them heal.
