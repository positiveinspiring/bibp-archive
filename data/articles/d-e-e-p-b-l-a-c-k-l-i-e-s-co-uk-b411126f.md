APPENDIX 6.13
Reproduced
below is chapter 31 in its entirety extracted from the
Marcos
Legacy Revisited subtitled: Raiders of the Lost
Gold, by Erick A. San Juan, published in 1998 in
Makati City, Philippines. My thanks to
"Dirk" for providing this.
Of interest is
the sloppy prose style and typographical errors that
closely correspond to the "mistakes"
contained on all of Peter Johnston's gold bullion
certificates - perhaps indicating that this,
also, was written with "deniability"
in mind?
CHAPTER 31
The
Trilateral Commission's Aborted Deal with FM
The aborted deal of the CORPORATION INTERNATIONAL with the
late Pres. Ferdinand Marcos (better known as the Trilateral
Commission) involved an agreement in which the president was
promised power for life and a guarantee of an Investment Loan
to be coursed through a Mini-Marshall plan to save the failing
Philippine economy. All these in exchange for his gold
bullion.
The original document showing specifically how much gold
Marcos kept at Fort Knox was given to me by an emissary of
President Marcos which I handed, in trust, to Reynaldo Fajardo,
who was supposed to write a book on this. This was the very
same document brought by Ambassador Philip Habib to Manila in
February 1986 for Marcos' signature. Marcos, however, didn't
sign the document because THE CORPORATION wanted the gold
bullion for themselves alone and merely offered to give him an
investment loan in exchange. Soon after, through Cardinal
Jaime Sin's call for people support, and armed with "Plan
C," employing the Marxist principle "Religion is the
opium of society." EDSA People Power came to the fore.
This marked the beginning of Marcos' downfall.
A photocopy of these records was passed on to me by my friend,
Col. Adex Villalon (RES). Had Marcos known of an impending
conflict between the Philippine Government and his family, he
could have immediately signed Habib's document and could have
lived happily ever after.
The following is the text of the Trilateral Commission's
communique with the late president Ferdinand Marcos under the
letterhead, THE CORPORATION INTERNATIONAL, brought by then
U.S. Ambassador Philip Habib for F.M.'s approval and
subsequent signature. The deal turned sour because the
CORPORATION wanted to get everything, simply leaving Marcos a
so-called investment loan out of his total gold hoard. On my
visits to Hawaii, Marcos made it clear to me that he did not
sign the document because, in his own words "para akong
pinirito sa sarili kong mantika" (I would have been fried
in my own lard). He further added that he had all those years,
invested so much of his time, expertise, strategies, and a lot
of guts, just to safeguard all the wealth which he intended to
offer his countrymen's future and that of our children's
children. This was also the reason why he was forced to leave
Malacanang to regroup in Paoay, Ilocos Norte, but instead, he
claimed to have been kidnapped, taken by force and against his
will by the Americans and flown to Hawaii.
NOTE: The photocopy clearly displayed the entire logo of THE
CORPORATION INTERNATIONAL, with the words "CLOAKED WITH
SECRECY" stamped on every page, together with the
following details on each page's right-hand margin:

REQUEST ATTENTION TO:
____________________
____________________ THRU:
1. THE CODED PRIVATE SELLER OF SCATTERED GOLD BARS IN THE
PHILIPPINES
INVESTMENT LOANS:
SUCCESFULLY AND DISCREETLY LOANS ARRANGED FROM 1980 TO 1985
INCLUSIVE WITH 216 PRIME LEAD BANKS BY PN-1518254 AND HIS 25
SECRET GROUPS: WITH PARTICIPATIONS OF CODED GROUPS FROM USA
AND EUROPE.
SUBJECT :
READINESS AND AVAILABILITY AND BLOCKED U.S. DLRS 100 BILLION,
OR U.S. DLRS 150-BILLION INITIALLY AS INVESTMENT LOANS OFFERED
TO THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT THRU THE CODED PRIVATE SELLER OF
THESE 62,321 METRIC TONS OF GOLD BARS OR MORE.
THESE USDLRS BILLION FUNDS AS INVESTMENT LOANS HAVE BEEN
ARRANGED-NEGOTIATED SINCE 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984 WITH
USDLRS 600-BILLION CAN BE REACTIVATED WITH 1,000 PRIME BANKS
IN THE U.S.A. AND EUROPE WITHIN 20 DAYS FROM ACCEPTANCE AND
REPAYABLE WITH 62,321 METRIC TONS OR MORE OF THESE GOLD BARS
OF RECORDED 999.9% PURITY OF DIFFERENT SIZES OR DENOMINATIONS
OWNED AND POSSESSED BY PHILIPPINES/ CODED PRIVATE SELLER IN
THE PHILIPPINES.
C O N F I D E
N T I A L
1) 62,321 METRIC TONS OF GOLD BARS IN THE PHILIPPINES, ETC.
Hereunder in simple words are the facts and events in a
nutshell to which we adhered and by reasons of which, we, thru
the code 'U.S.A.D.T' the World-Sole-Financially Established
lenders-buyers and the European Lenders-Buyers, have both
recognized without any reservation, the rights, possession,
ownership and disposition of these gold bars with recorded
999.9% purity of different sizes and denominations of
your/Philippines and for which we agree, as we have agreed to
give INVESTMENT LOANS repayable with these gold bars in the
Philippines, vice-versa.
2) IN THE PHILIPPINES
These 62,321 Metric Tons or more of gold bars are in the
Philippines, but secretly, per our calculations only about
43,200 Metric Tons of these gold bars had been found and
excavated from 1972 to 1980, the other 20,000 Metric Tons, or
more, are still to be located and 'excavated' (?), or already
very secretly-shrewdly in the hands of some retired/active
Generals (?) and/or private Hunters-Priests, alike.
3) READINESS OF UNLIMITED USDLRS-BILLION FUNDS AS
INVESTMENT LOANS: PHILIPPINES IN CRISIS
The Philippines is in a sort of serious political and economic
crisis. Every and all bankers in the world are refusing to
give financial aids and no more foreign banks and foreign
institutions would lend money to the Philippine Government due
to its huge unpaid external debts, and the only salvation as
we believe and know pretty clear are these gold bars of the
coded seller thru 'Authority' under the principle of 'Pares
Patria' thru, the initial USDLRS IOO-Billion and up to USDLRS
150-Billion which had long been blocked and ready since
December 2, 1985 and the USDLRS 600-Billion can be easily
reactivated by fiduciary-principals of ours, thru code: "U.S.A.D.T."
and the European groups with its 1,000 prime banks within 20
days, more or less, if these offers are accepted. And all
these U.S. BILLION FUNDS are all for INVESTMENT LOANS for the
Philippine/coded seller and repayable with all these 62,321
Metric Tons, or more, of gold bars of any size or denomination
with 999.9% purity.
4) BEGINNING OF NEGOTIATIONS ABROAD WHOEVER THE CODED
PRIVATE SELLER
Therefore Sir, with much due respect to the private coded
seller authorized for these huge transactions in connection
with these scattered gold bars of different sizes in the
Philippines 999.9% purity and 24 carat - we wish you to know,
thru the undersigned coded Chairman of the Confidential
Committee, in order these highly classified messages may
eventually reach the coded seller of these 62,321 or more
Metric Tons of gold bars with different sizes or denominations
that initially USDLRS 100-Billion or USDLRS 150-Billion as
Investment-Loans have long been readied and blocked and can be
reactivated within a very reasonable time. To be repetitious,
all these INVESTMENT LOANS as cited above, initially USDLRS
100-Billion have had already been readied and blocked since
December 2, 1985 up to the present with 1,000 prime banks in
the USA continents and in some 500 primebanks in the European
countries---with USDLRS 600 Billion or more can be reactivated
within 20 days or more, are all for direct INVESTMENT LOANS to
the Philippines/coded seller who is naturally under the 'Pares
Patria' of the President of the Philippines and which are
repayable in 24 hours only with these 62,321 Metric Tons or
more of gold bars of different sizes and denominations and
with 999.9% purity. These USDLRS BILLION DOLLARS can be
verified on bank-to-bank levels only.
5) MAN CODED PNI518254 AND HIS SECRET GROUPS INTERNAL AND
ABROAD
If only to help the Philippines and his countrymen thru his
beloved President to secure the unlimited U.S. Billion Dollars
as Investment loans and overcome the political and economic
uncertainties of the Philippines, this coded man, PN1518254 or
code '12241942/AA (BBRP) ABLLIB' had resigned from his gainful
banking-finance-law practices giving up his retainership of 43
private corporations and even went to the extent of, at the
great sacrifice of his family and relatives of encumbering his
properties some of which have already been forfeited and
spending with his groups both foreign and local to the tune of
more than 315,000 dollars had worked and still is working very
hard with HIS AFORESAID GROUPS TO TIGHTLY HOLD ON THESE 8,000
foreign banks and to successfully secure these unlimited U.S.
Billion Dollars as Investment Loan, all repayable with these
gold bars in the Philippines.
6) OUR FOREIGN FIDUCIARY PRINCIPALS' REQUIREMENTS
Therefore, thru our foreign fiduciary
principals-lenders-buyers, we request the following:
1. Ocular inspection of all these (Physical stocks) gold bars
in the Philippines or elsewhere abroad by PN1518254 soonest
with coded 'U.S.A.D.T.' representative and the certification
of availability and genuineness of aforesaid gold bars from
the International Prime Trust bank of seller on the deposit of
these gold bars or two hard copies authorization from the
President of the Philippines or his authorized Minister
confirming the availability of these gold bars about 62,321
Metric Tons or more of any sizes and purity of 999.5% or
999.9% and the readiness and willingness to accept our
Investment Loan offers which are all repayable with these
aforesaid gold bars and after assay and determination of the
genuineness of gold bars of the U.S.A.D.T./USA and the
European Legitimate Lenders-Buyers, will pay thru coded
sellers' prime banks, or on any suggested procedures from
coded authorized seller/ Philippine coded Authority that can
be mutually agreed upon.
2. These U.S.A.D.T./LENDERS-BUYERS GROUPS from the USA,
together with the European groups, shall always be FLEXIBLE
and UNDERSTANDING to the secret requirements of the Authority/
Coded Private Seller, knowing these huge transactions have to
partake of a very PRIVATE TRANSACTION IN NATURE.
3. All incentives and commissions are deducted at source with
international tariff of 10% and incentives of 7% less 2% for
PN1518524/Foreign Groups/Local VIPS/GROUPS.
4. That our U.S.A.D.T. Lenders-Buyers groups in the USA will
pay CASH ONE THIRD of the total prices based on the London
Second Fix of all these gold bars of any sizes, minus/less
above international Tariff 10% and 7% commissions deducted at
source, with remaining balance corresponding to the prices of
all these gold bars, shall be paid depending on the
"WISHES" of the coded Seller assigned for this
purpose.
7) MECHANICS OF USDLRS-BILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT LOANS FOR
THE PHILIPPINES
The mechanics of these unlimited USDLRS-BILLION DOLLARS as
INVESTMENT LOANS are as follows:
1. Since these huge confidential transactions involving USDLRS
983 Billion which are "perhaps" the actual price of
these gold bars in the Philippines, which price is based on
London Second Fix, less the ten (10%) percent tariff for
rebaring, recasting and reassaying deductible for every
release of these USDLRS-BILLION funds as INVESTMENT LOANS and
less further the seven (7%) percent as incentives and tax
sales abroad (to 7% less 2% for codes LOCAL VIPS/ GROUPS AND
PN1518524 and 1,000 to 2,000 members groups)--- are purely
private transactions --- and no world financing agencies will
ever know any of these huge transactions, except the coded
private seller and the confidential Philippine AUTHORITY.
2. It will appear in all banks documentation of these coded
"U.S.A.D.T." LENDERS-BUYERS GROUPS from the USA, as
well as from the EUROPEAN LENDERS-BUYERS GROUPS - the former
represented by the private company while the latter is
represented also by private company, respectively, that all
these initial USDLRS100-Billion or more will appear exactly as
'VOLUNTARY INVESTMENT LOANS' to coded seller for
"PHILIPPINE AUTHORITY" and for that reason, as if
an, repeat as if an, INVESTMENT LOANS AGREEMENT shall be
signed at the office of the Philippine President, when in
truth, it is the acceptance of these US-HUNDREDS BILLION
DOLLARS FUNDS very secretly and the simultaneous turn-over to
our two groups of all those gold bar's with 999.9% purity.
3. And behind these INVESTMENT LOANS --- for the reasons the
initial USDLRS 100-Billion or initial USDLRS 150-Billion as
irrevocably certified by our 10 to 40 lead prime international
banks and these funds are good as CASH - thus there will only
be two permanent and exclusive contracts to be signed with the
coded private seller under the umbrella of "Code1 "
of the Philippines in favor of our two world most financially
established democratic lenders-buyers groups, i. e. the
U.S.A.D.T / LENDERS-BUYERS GROUPS from the USA and the
EUROPEAN GROUPS, and which contracts shall be signed in the
physical presence of that "Authority" of the
Philippines, at Malacanang Palace, Manila, Philippines:
4. Simultaneously, within 10 days, after such agreements and
acceptance of the Initial USDLRS-100 Billion, or USDLRS
150-Billion, with our licensed international assayers of these
two world most established Financial coded groups, as
buyers-lenders shall proceed to personally conduct the
assaying of all the physical stocks of these gold bars which
may last up to May 30, 1986; thereafter, these physical stocks
of gold bars, if found genuine, the coded "U.S.A.D.T."
LENDERS-BUYERS GROUPS will immediately issue so-called
Certified funds from International Prime Banks for the
balance.
8) ABSOLUTE GUARANTEE BY THESE TWO LENDERS-BUYERS GROUPS
The U.S.A.D.T world most established Financial Legitimate
moneyed groups from the USA thru its front company and with
the EUROPEAN LENDERS-BUYERS GROUPS thru its front-company
hereby mutually, thru the undersigned committee Chairman, has
IRREVOCABLY, UNEQUIVOCALLY AND ABSOLUTELY guaranteed that the
private coded seller and his "AUTHORITY" of the
Philippines shall be free and exempt from any civil or
criminal liability or international suits that may arise in
connection with these gold bars transactions which these two
most financially established groups are buying with the
processes and mechanics of so-called "INVESTMENT LOANS
AGREEMENTS"; and the undersigned members and chairman of
the finance confidential committee of these USADT-LENDERS-BUYERS
from the USA and the EUROPEAN-LENDERS-BUYERS will all do the
hauling and transporting of all these gold bars very quietly
at their expense without any obligations whatsoever from
private coded seller and his "Authority" after the
assay are finished up to May 1986, through the U.S.A. 90,000
deadweight tons Aircraft Carrier in one or two shipments only
and very confidentially. Further whatever PENDING CASES this
coded seller or his "AUTHORITY" has filed against
them with the International Court of Justice or International
Forum, these two word most established financial and moneyed
groups through the undersigned members and chairman of the
Finance Committee shall be answerable and responsible and
hereby, these coded world's group assume any and all
obligations unconditionally and responsibility thereto.
9) FINAL OFFER AND CONCLUSION
The acceptance of these USDLRS 600-Billion up to USDLRS
983-Billion, with initial USDLRS 100-Billion and/or
USDLRS150-Billion already BLOCKED since December 2, 1984 and
November 7, 1985 as INVESTMENT LOANS, and all repayable very
secretly and CONFIDENTIALLY with all these gold bars in the
Philippines of about 62,321 Metric Tons or more with 999.9%
purity --- the first and primary "contact" to be
made by said "AUTHORITY" /coded private seller (thru
its seller's international bank) should be coursed first its
acceptance of these UNLIMITED-US-BILLION DOLLARS as Investment
Loans to the same man coded as PN1518254 or "12241942/ AA
(BBRP) ABLLIB" and with coded seller will know where to
immediately "contact" this PN1518254.
With the foregoing facts and events and more practically our
aforesaid adherence and firmed and complete recognition of the
Philippines' rights, possession, ownership and disposition of
all those gold bars, we, thru the coded "U.S.A.D.T."
MONEYED-LENDERS-BUYERS from the USA and with the European
lenders-buyers groups, ---now wish to call the special
attention of:
10) CODED SELLER THRU HIS "AUTHORITY" CONCERNED
On these "INVESTMENT LOANS" long negotiated and
finally arranged from 1980 to 1984 inclusive with 216 foreign
prime banks by the man coded as PN1518254 or "12241942 (BBRP)ABBLIB"
and his groups, with the principal participations of Foreign
groups (USA) and the European groups.
Consequently, the READINESS and AVAILABILITY of all these
UNLIMITED US-BILLION DOLLARS as INVESTMENT LOANS cited above
are all blocked since December 2, 1985 exclusively intended
for the Philippine' coded seller repayable with these 62,321
Metric Tons of gold bars, or more, in the Philippines. And
with these huge sums as INVESTMENT LOANS are still intact,
"frozen" so to say with the 3,000 prime banks in the
USA and in 500 prime banks in the European continents earning
nothing since December 2, 1985 up to the present while other
end users /countries in the world are all in bad need of these
"BLOCKED-US BILLION DOLLARS."
These two-world-moneyed groups thru the undersigned had agreed
with coded seller that all these gold bars transactions should
be treated as very PRIVATE IN NATURE and no involvement of any
public officials nor Philippine embassies abroad, and we shall
always be FLEXIBLE, UNDERSTANDING and SYMPATHETIC to the
"requirements" of the Philippine "coded
seller." And finally, with the successful and
confidential conclusion of this transaction, it becomes
necessary immediately to convert the present Central Bank
Minting facilities to an internationally accepted gold bullion
refinery, either as subsidiaries of world renown minting firms
such as the Johnson Mathey, National Mint or the likes or as
separate private company under the Trilateral supervision.
Now, it's up to YOU, SIR, to make the 54 Million Filipino
people happy and economically and industrually stable and
solid with these UNLIMITED BILLION USDLRS INVESTMENT LOANS
repayable with these 62,321 Metric Tons of gold bars or more
in your country. Don't wait for others to claim this IMMORTAL
CREDIT. Kindly do it while you are in your solid possession
and right and you alone can do it and alone can claim immortal
glory as the greatest man in Asia.
Yours very respectfully,
