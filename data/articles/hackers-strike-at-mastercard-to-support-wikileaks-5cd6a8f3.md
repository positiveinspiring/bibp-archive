LONDON
Hackers rushed to the defense of WikiLeaks on
Wednesday, launching attacks on MasterCard, Visa, Swedish prosecutors, a
Swiss bank and others who have acted against the site and its jailed founder
Julian Assange.
Internet "hacktivists" operating under the label "Operation Payback" claimed
responsibility in a Twitter message for causing severe technological
problems at the website for MasterCard, which pulled the plug on its
relationship with WikiLeaks a day ago.
MasterCard acknowledged "a service disruption" involving its Secure Code
system for verifying online payments, but spokesman James Issokson said
consumers could still use their credit cards for secure transactions. Later
Wednesday, Visa's website was inaccessible.
The online attacks are part of a wave of support for WikiLeaks that is
sweeping the Internet. Twitter was choked with messages of solidarity for
the group, while the site's Facebook page hit 1 million fans.
Late Wednesday, Operation Payback itself appeared to run into problems, as
many of its sites went down. It was unclear who was behind the
counterattack.
MasterCard is the latest in a string of U.S.-based Internet companies -
including Visa, Amazon.com, PayPal Inc. and EveryDNS - to cut ties to
WikiLeaks in recent days amid intense U.S. government pressure.
PayPal was
not having problems Wednesday but the company said it faced,
"a dedicated
denial-of-service attack" on Monday.
WikiLeaks' extensive releases of secret U.S. diplomatic cables have
embarrassed U.S. allies, angered rivals, and reopened old wounds across the
world. U.S. officials in Washington say other countries have curtailed their
dealings with the U.S. government because of WikiLeaks' actions.
PayPal Vice President Osama Bedier said the company froze WikiLeaks' account
after seeing a letter from the U.S. State Department to WikiLeaks saying
that the group's activities,
"were deemed illegal in the United States."
Offline, WikiLeaks was under pressure on many fronts.
Assange is in a
British prison fighting extradition to Sweden over a sex crimes case.
Recent
moves by,
-
Swiss Postfinance
-
MasterCard
-
PayPal,
...and others that cut the flow
of donations to the group have impaired its ability to raise money.
Neither WikiLeaks nor Assange has been charged with any offense in the U.S.,
but the U.S. government is investigating whether Assange can be prosecuted
for espionage or other offenses. Assange has not been charged with any
offenses in Sweden either, but authorities there want to question him about
the allegations of sex crimes.
Undeterred, WikiLeaks released more confidential U.S. cables Wednesday. The
latest batch showed the British government feared a furious Libyan reaction
if the convicted Lockerbie bomber wasn't set free and expressed relief when
they learned he would be released in 2009 on compassionate grounds.
Another U.S. memo described German leader Angela Merkel as the "Teflon"
chancellor, but she brushed it off as mere chatter at a party.
American
officials were also shown to be lobbying the Russian government to amend a
financial bill they felt would disadvantage U.S. companies Visa and
MasterCard.
The most surprising cable of the day came from a U.S. diplomat in Saudi
Arabia after a night on the town.
"The underground nightlife of Jiddah's elite
youth is thriving and throbbing," the memo said. "The full range of
worldly temptations and vices are available - alcohol, drugs, sex - but
all behind closed doors."
The pro-WikiLeaks vengeance campaign on
Wednesday appeared to be taking the form of denial-of-service attacks in
which computers are harnessed - sometimes surreptitiously - to jam target
sites with mountains of requests for data, knocking them out of commission.
Per Hellqvist, a security specialist with the firm Symantec, said a network
of web activists called Anonymous - to which
Operation Payback is affiliated
- appeared to be behind many of the attacks.
The group, which has previously focused on the
Church of Scientology and the music industry, is knocking offline websites
seen as hostile to WikiLeaks.
"While we don't have much of an affiliation
with WikiLeaks, we fight for the same reasons," the group said in a
statement.
"We want transparency and we counter censorship... we intend
to utilize our resources to raise awareness, attack those against and
support those who are helping lead our world to freedom and democracy."
The website for Swedish lawyer Claes Borgstrom,
who represents the two women at the center of Assange's sex crimes case, was
unreachable Wednesday. The Swiss postal system's financial arm, Postfinance,
which shut down Assange's bank account on Monday, was also having trouble.
Spokesman Alex Josty said the website buckled
under a barrage of traffic Tuesday.
"Yesterday it was very, very difficult, then
things improved overnight," he told the AP. "But it's still not entirely
back to normal."
Ironically, the microblogging site Twitter -
home of much WikiLeaks support - could become the next target.
Operation
Payback posted a statement claiming,
"Twitter you're next for censoring Wikileaks
discussion."
Some WikiLeaks supporters accuse Twitter of
preventing the term "WikiLeaks" from appearing as one of its popular
"trending topics." Twitter denies censorship, saying the topics are
determined by an algorithm.
Twitter's top trending topics are not the ones people are discussing the
most overall, but those they are talking about more right now than they did
previously, Twitter explained in an e-mail Wednesday. If tweets were ranked
by volume alone, the weather or other mundane topics would dominate the
trends.
WikiLeaks angered the U.S. government earlier this year when it posted a
video showing U.S. troops on a helicopter
gunning down two Reuters
journalists in Iraq.
Since then, the organization has leaked some 400,000
classified U.S. war files from Iraq and 76,000 from Afghanistan, which U.S.
military officials say could put people's lives at risk. In the last few
weeks, the group has begun leaking a massive trove of secret U.S. diplomatic
cables.
U.S. officials have directed their anger at Assange, but others have begun
to ask whether Washington shares the blame for the diplomatic uproar.
"The core of all this lies with the failure
of the government of the United States to properly protect its own
diplomatic communications," Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said
Wednesday, criticizing the fact that tens of thousands of U.S.
government employees had access to the cables.
Assange, meanwhile, faces a new extradition
hearing in London next week where his lawyers plan to reapply for bail. The
39-year-old Australian denies two women's allegations in Sweden of rape,
molestation and unlawful coercion, and is fighting his extradition to
Sweden.
In a Twitter message Wednesday, WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson
shrugged off the challenges.
"We will not be gagged, either by judicial
action or corporate censorship... WikiLeaks is still online," Hrafnsson
said.
