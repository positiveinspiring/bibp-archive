If Al Qaeda and their ideologues were able to secure a nuclear
arsenal
I think you would look back and say, Why did George
Bush not hold the line? We cannot show weakness in this world
today.
George W. Bush, 2004

The mythology of hope and change is often assumed to be THE great
American myth.
Pioneers taming the wilderness, making the world
better every day in every way and eventually, perhaps, creating a Kingdom of
God on earth, leading the whole world to endless progress or ultimate
redemption: What could be more American than that?
But a second mythology, less often noticed, has been intertwined with the
first from the very beginning of white immigration to the British colonies
of North America:
the mythology of homeland insecurity.
The founders of
Jamestown in 1607 chose the site largely because it was almost completely
surrounded by water.
To reinforce their sense of security they built
a wooden fortress to surround their settlement. Their certainty that they
were planting civilization inside their fortress, while savagery was kept
outside its wall, was another way they struggled to keep their insecurity at
bay.
Ever since, boundaries - natural, constructed, and imaginary - have served
not only to demarcate the frontier being pushed ever further into the west
and the future, but, equally importantly, to protect against the threatening
forces that were believed to lie beyond the frontier in every direction. The
oceans, rivers, mountains, and deserts were not only challenges for
Americans to cross, driven by the hope of creating change.
They were also bulwarks to prevent others from
invading the American homeland and to prevent the fear of invasion from
overwhelming the nation.
Boundaries were drawn on maps and guarded by
armed men for the same defensive purposes, as were symbols of imagined
demarcation, from the churches of the earliest colonial settlements to the
nuclear umbrella and the Star Wars shield. All were depended on for
security.
Before exploring the mythology of homeland insecurity, lets briefly
consider the very idea of security. Security is never an objective thing,
like a rock or a telephone. What looks like a secure situation to one person
or nation can look very insecure to another.
Is insecurity, then, just a subjective feeling, an emotion? Insecurity may
surely generate anxiety and other emotional responses. But it may not.
For example, when pollsters ask,
Do you expect the U.S. to be struck again
by terrorists? some sizeable number of respondents will say Yes.
Yet few of those people are likely to have
sweating palms or a faster pulse rate at that moment, much less all the
time.
The basic sense of insecurity - the one they
carry around all the time - is not an emotion. It is a judgment about their
situation, a belief, an attitude, a point of view. If the judgment seems
certain it becomes a conviction, and then it may very well function as if it
were an immediate perception of an objective reality.
Although everyone is ultimately free to form their own judgments, views on
large societal issues are hugely influenced by the culture in which we live.
They are shaped by, expressed in, and sustained by the prevailing national
myths. Certainly, our sense of national security and insecurity is shaped by
the web of myth that our culture weaves into our lives.
The further away the purported danger, the more true that is. If my house is
on fire, I dont need cultural forces to tell me Im in danger.
But suppose Im convinced that some people in a
mountain hideout on the other side of the world are plotting to set my house
on fire, or to destroy my way of life. Unless Ive seen and talked with them
directly, that conviction comes solely from the mythic images that my
culture provides.
The culture of the colonists, though filled with hope for positive change,
was also pervaded by mythic images of insecurity. People who saw themselves
as fundamentally secure were not likely to leave Europe. For most of the
early emigrants, there was obvious danger as well as opportunity in coming
to a land imagined as surrounded on three sides by wilderness and savagery,
while from the fourth side, in Europe, colonial powers vied for control of
North America.
In the first decades after the United States was born, perceptions of danger
continued to shape the national experience. Along the frontier, territorial
expansion inevitably triggered conflict with native peoples, who served as
the primary representation of threat to individuals and communities.
Thus the frontier was well fortified and its
white residents were heavily armed.
Closer to the seaboard, there was a widespread fear that the very existence
of the nation was threatened by foreign enemies - Spain, France, and most
commonly England. Every early president, in his own way, contributed to a
growing tradition of a proud, resolute foreign policy dedicated to keeping
the nations borders inviolable.
The War of 1812 gave a powerful boost to this
tradition and pride. Yet British conquest of the U.S. was still feared in
some quarters as a real possibility through the 1840s.
The nations mission and its very existence were again thrown in doubt when
a group of states became, for four years, a foreign nation.
Lincoln, like so many of his contemporaries,
cast the war in apocalyptic terms: A negotiated peace was unthinkable
because it would destroy the Union; overwhelming military might was the only
bulwark against catastrophe. (Of course the Confederacy legitimated itself
with similarly apocalyptic language.)
The end of the Civil War temporarily laid to rest doubts about the nations
survival. Within a few decades the threat from native peoples had ceased,
too, though insecurity was heightened by growing nativist fears of the many
foreigners flooding to Americas shores. But by the end of the 19th
century, as the U.S. began to play a greater role in international affairs,
the nations life seemed again entangled in a world of dangerous conflict.
The redeemer nations rising vision of global
mission and its rising military (especially naval) might could hardly avoid
breeding a sense of insecurity.
At the outset of the 20th century,
war in the Philippines made it vividly clear that the frontier might now
appear anywhere in the world, seemingly overnight, calling for resolute
defensive action.
Woodrow Wilson is best remembered for his devout of expressions of hope that
American participation in World War I would insure a far better, perhaps
millennial, postwar world of universal democracy. But a central part of his
vision was a world of national borders everywhere kept inviolable.
And his rhetorical campaign to foster public
support for the war effort relied heavily on apocalyptic warnings:
A German victory would spell the end of the
American way of life, which would mean (and here Wilson merely repeated
a staple of the nations mythic tradition) the end of civilization
itself.
National insecurity - fears for the nations
existence - spiked rapidly during World war I.
Then the fears abated just as rapidly and seemed
quite distant for the next two decades.
FDR AND THE MYTHOLOGY
OF NATIONAL INSECURITY
Of course, there was still plenty of evidence of insecurity, including
(among others) poverty-stricken farmers, white supremacist vigilantes,
organized criminal syndicates, striking workers and the forces that
suppressed them, and ultimately the Great Depression, bringing disillusion
and its anxieties to nearly everyone.
On Inauguration Day, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt warned not merely of
fear but of a nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror haunting the land,
and he promised to make sure that America defeated both the terror and the
Depression just as it had defeated the Germans.
During his first term in the White House, FDR
did much to help the nation recover its confidence that democratic
capitalism would survive.
By the middle of his second term, though, the focus of public anxiety was
shifting toward Europe, where another war seemed a growing possibility. When
FDR was quoted in 1939 as saying that Americas frontier was now on the
Rhine it was a fairly accurate paraphrase of what he told some senators
privately. [ii]
But the resulting public storm forced him to
deny he ever said it.
Few Americans could yet imagine, much less
endorse, sending their sons to fight another foreign war.
Roosevelts most lasting accomplishment - even more influential than the
changes he wrought in domestic policy - was to change foreign entanglement
from unthinkable to inevitable in the nations mythic life. By December 7,
1941, even the most diehard anti-interventionists were likely to accept the
necessity of war in Europe as well as the Pacific.
FDRs masterful rhetorical campaign made every
other option seem irrelevant.
Virtually single-handedly Roosevelt (helped by skilled speechwriters)
created the modern American mythology of national insecurity. Theres no
evidence that he did so intentionally. He was using his great talent for
mythic language to build support for specific policies in response to
specific, rapidly shifting situations.
Like any great myth-maker, he constantly created
new variations and elaborations of his story. But he wove them all around a
single, consistent foundational narrative.
That narrative can be summed up rather
concisely:
We Americans have always wanted whats best
for ourselves and for the world.
Our national policies have never
intentionally aimed to hurt anyone. Yet we have enemies who want to
destroy us, our way of life, and civilization itself. The threat is
apocalyptic in magnitude. Since nations are now interwoven in a global
network of relationships, we are open to attack everywhere. The world
has become an endless reservoir of potential enemies.
Our own policies played no role in generating these dangers. Our
enemies are motivated by irrational impulses we can never understand. So
we cannot conciliate our differences with them.
Since our own policies
bear no responsibility for their acts of resistance, we have no reason
to reconsider our policies or look for alternative approaches. The only
thing left to do is to resist our foes, using violence when necessary.
That may well provoke resistance from them in return. But we are
obviously acting only in self-defense, seeking only a benign peace. So
we have every reason to see our foes resistance as further evidence
that we truly do face an apocalyptic peril. We have no choice but fight
on - or prepare to fight - everywhere, forever.
Through no fault of our own, we are stuck in
a permanent cycle of insecurity.
This was Roosevelts public myth.
Privately, among policymakers and elite leaders,
he endorsed the economic and geopolitical paradigm most often called liberal
internationalism, which came to dominate U.S. foreign policy during his
presidency.
Though liberal internationalism was a broad and
complicated movement, its main thrust was to demand a single, unified global
capitalist marketplace braced up by more or less democratic political
systems everywhere. Ultimately it was - and remains today - a mythic vision:
America would lead the great capitalists powers in creating and then
guaranteeing the continued existence of this global system.
In this narrative, security means imposing a substantial degree of American
economic and geopolitical control all over the world.
The euphemistic code words for this goal of
control are security and stability. If we achieve stability everywhere - if
no one can challenge our vital interests anywhere - then we can live at
peace.
Peace and security and its synonym, peace and
stability, are the mantras of American foreign policy.
All manner of violence seems acceptable as long
as it serves this goal.
Of course this privately circulated myth, when enacted in policy, is very
likely to generate resistance in various parts of the world at various times
- places and times that prove to be unpredictable. The cycle of conflict and
the need to be constantly on guard are inescapable.
So it is no accident that the modern obsession
with national security was born in the same era as liberal internationalism.
They were conjoined twins; the same historical process gave birth to both
and made them inseparable.
The private mythology of national security is, even more than the public,
actually a mythology of national insecurity.
Thus, while Roosevelt was intentionally bringing
the nation a feeling of freedom from fear in some respects, he was at the
same time, albeit unintentionally, laying the foundations of a fear-based
political culture that would endure long after he was gone.
THE MYTHOLOGY OF
INSECURITY TRIUMPHANT
The tears of mourning for FDR were hardly dry when the American news media
reported that a terrible new weapon, exploded over Japan, might some day be
used against the United States itself.
Fear of nuclear holocaust was soon attached to
an overwhelming fear of the Soviet Union; yesterdays heroic ally became
todays monstrous enemy. Soon millions of Americans felt the fear of
internal communist subversion that we call the McCarthyite witch-hunt.
By 1950, when the U.S. police effort in Korea received almost universal
approbation, it was clear that Roosevelts mythology of national insecurity,
though developed to address one particular set of enemies, was not tied to
that set. It could be successfully transplanted to interpret any foe or any
danger that seemed to threaten on any new frontier, foreign or domestic.
In 1953 the new Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower, embraced the
Democrats doctrine of containment.
By this time the Rooseveltian vision of a
unified, global capitalist system was well on the way to being realized, at
least in the free world where that system prevailed. The logic of liberal
internationalist discourse dictated that change of any fundamental sort in
the free world should be resisted, because the risks of fundamental change
were so terrifying that they outweighed its benefits.
Ike told aides that he aimed to build an
impermeable dike [iii] around the communist bloc.
Change can never be escaped, though, as Eisenhower acknowledged when he
proclaimed that the U.S. faced not a moment of peril but an age of peril.
For eight years he kept up his warnings of impending, communist-initiated
nuclear catastrophe. Cold war fear was now the new normal, one of his
staffers wrote, [iv] echoing his bosss premise that the peril
could never be ended.
The only option Eisenhower offered was to impose
enough control over the nations foes to manage apocalyptic threats forever.
His policy of containment - I have called it
apocalypse management - was more truly intended to create a dike that
would surround the free world, and especially America, on every side, to
maintain its status quo in the face of any and all threatening changes.
Ironically, though the liberal internationalists had defeated the
anti-interventionists (the so-called isolationists) and their policy of
fortress America, it was the liberal internationalist policy of
containment that effectively turned America into a mythic fortress,
sheltered behind walls of symbolic safety on every side.
Eisenhowers version of the mythology of
national insecurity crystallized a defensive and conservative stance that
became the dominant pattern of U.S. foreign policy discourse throughout the
cold war era. Ikes political success made it clear that his version of the
Rooseveltian story would have bipartisan support.
Indeed, John F. Kennedy charged that the Republicans were not taking the
permanent threat seriously enough, that the United States now faced its
hour of maximum danger.
To confront that danger, he ordered a massive
increase in the U.S. military arsenal and the dispatch of more troops to
Vietnam, where the line encasing the free world seemed most vulnerable.
Lyndon Johnson turned the Vietnam mission into a full-scale war, because the
alternative seemed too frightening to contemplate.
With that decision, he set in motion events that
would briefly tear away Americas mask of confidence and reveal the
political, social, and cultural chaos simmering beneath the surface.
Political-cultural movements and trends that were not based on fear
flourished briefly during the Vietnam war years, but they never took hold as
dominant trends.
Since then, American culture has been somewhat more conscious of the anxious
uncertainty that had actually plagued the nation long before the Vietnam war
era.
But the demand for apocalypse management has not
abated. It was clear among elites even after the cold war ended.
The Republican General Colin Powell
warned that the U.S. needs,
the ability to respond to the crisis nobody
expected
The real threat is the unknown, the uncertain. [v]
The Democratic pundit Thomas Friedman
explained that,
the emerging global order needs an
enforcer. Thats Americas new burden.; The hidden hand of the market
will never work without a hidden fist. McDonalds cannot flourish
without McDonnell-Douglas. [vi]
The public affirmed the mythic narrative of
insecurity again in full force on September 11, 2001.
George W. Bush articulated the nations dominant assumptions
when he promised to hold the line against an apocalyptic threat with no
foreseeable end, a threat that would destroy the nation, and indeed the
whole civilized world, if America did not stand steadfast against it.
To that end he created a new Department of
Homeland Security - which might be better named the Department of Homeland
Insecurity.
Barack Obamas support for the
rapidly growing Department
and for so much of Bushs anti-terrorism campaign is the clearest sign of
continued bipartisan support for what is now best termed the mythology of
homeland insecurity.
The triumph of this mythology since the 1940s has had profound effects on
American political culture in the domestic as well as foreign arenas.
It is no accident that, with the exception of
those few brief years of the Vietnam war era, the political trend has moved
decidedly toward the right. No matter what the issue, we ask our elected
officials, above all, to protect us from dangerous change.
As Maureen Dowd
has written,
Every election has the same narrative: Can
the strong father protect the house from invaders? - invaders, she
might have added, who lurk everywhere and aim to burn the house down.
That has indeed been the dominant question of
every presidential election since 1932; since 1940, the invaders have most
commonly been identified as armed foreign forces.
But the name of the enemy is a secondary matter. It might any feared people:
communists, terrorists foreign and domestic, immigrants, drug dealers,
hippies, the religious right, etc.
It might be, not people, but abstract forces:
totalitarianism, economic disaster, crime,
big government, secular humanism, bigotry...
...the list is potentially endless.
The mythology of homeland insecurity requires
only the claim that someone or something endangers - and will always
endanger - the very existence of the nation.
This mythology dictates that Americas primary task is not to create a
millennial transformation or, indeed, any fundamental positive change at
all. Rather, the task is to stand firmly united, forever, against the
dreaded foes; to safeguard the existing global system, one way or another,
against any forces that might create fundamental change.
Peril and uncertainty now seem to be the basic,
enduring foundations of the nations life.
