In March 1991, Random House published The Seeker's Handbook - The
Complete Guide to Spiritual Pathfinding (TSH).
The book was carefully timed to serve the need
it defined, a need I identified in the social-spiritual trends of that
moment: namely, the need for orientation to, and clarification of, the
options presented in the
New Age movement (NAM), loosely known
as alternative spirituality.
The dawn of the 1990s saw that movement peaking.
My intention with this book was to offer a
pathfinding tool, something like an intellectual compass for navigating
through the huge array of books, teachers, programs, and practices that had
been proliferating massively since the 1960s.
To that end, I proposed the metaphor of the labyrinth to describe the
multiple winding pathways facing modern truth-seekers. I also suggested that
in our time, due to the very multiplicity of options for spiritual
development - everything from Baha'i to Buddhism to body work, from alchemy
to zen - the task of pathfinding itself becomes an art.
Sorting out what principle, program, or person
you are going to follow in undertaking a spiritual practice to guide your
life is on its own terms a challenging practice, regardless of which
practice you finally adopt!
This observation is as true now, I would say, as
it was when I wrote the book.
The Hermetica
It has not always been so, of course.
I dedicated a long section of TSH to ,
"how the radio came to the beach."
That is to say, how it developed historically
that Western society today faces such a vast range of options for
self-development along spiritual, metaphysical, and mystical lines.
Without going back beyond the Dark Ages to the
destruction of the Mysteries - another investigation, covered at length in
Not in His Image - I came forward from the
Renaissance.
The key event that laid the foundation for
today's eclectic New Age spirituality was the discovery of a sheaf of
writings entitled
The Hermetica.
The Lexicon of 1,000 entries in TSH defines
Hermetics:
From Greek, Hermes, equivalent to the
Egyptian Thoth, the God of writing, calculation and the sacred arts.
Loosely, the body of technical and inspirational teachings believed to
be derived from the secret schools of the Egyptian Mysteries.
Specifically, the corpus of thirteen rare
manuscripts introduced into Europe in the 15th century, which opened the
way to independent spiritual seeking in the West, especially through
disclosure of the concept of theogeny.
The inception of New Age spiritual pathfinding
happened in an almost single-handed way due to the influence of a Florentine
nobleman, Cosimo de Medici (1389-1464).
When he received the Egyptian manuscripts,
Cosimo deemed the "ancient wisdom" preserved therein to be of higher value
than the Bible, and predating Moses. He instructed Marsilio Ficino,
appointed by him to head the Florentine Academy of Arts and Sciences, to
translate the Hermetica from Greek into Latin for the edification of the
trendy Italian intelligentsia of his court.
In that single act, Cosimo initiated a chain of
events that led ultimately to the New Age movement of today.
TSH summarizes sixteen key themes of the modern alternative spirituality,
contrasted to conventional faiths such as Judaism, Christianity (Roman,
Protestant, and Orthodox), and Islam:
-
ancient wisdom
-
Gaia, goddess revival
-
shamanism
-
masters
-
planetisation
-
channeling
-
holistics and healing arts
-
East/West studies
-
martial arts and the warrior path
-
paranormal reality and psychic powers
-
reincarnation
-
earth changes
-
service and group effort (Aquarian
idealism)
-
metahistory (parallel or secret history)
-
para-physics, chaos/complexity theory,
physics of consciousness
-
co-creation
In the context of this essay, the final theme
has a telling import.
In the ultimate sense, it could be said that the
Hermetica introduced two closely linked themes into Western society, and
from this dyad all other aspects and ramifications of the New Age outlook
are generated.
These themes are,
-
co-creation, "you create your own
reality"
-
theogeny, "you become as gods, knowing
good and evil"
'Theogeny' is a made-up word I propose, not to
be confused with 'theogony,' meaning an account of the origin and
genealogy of the gods - as found in Hesiod's poem,
Theogony, for instance.
Theogeny means,
"the birth or genesis (-geneos) of divine
potential (theo-) in the human species."
The assertion of this god-like potential and the
call to cultivate it, is the hallmark of New Age philosophy and ethics at
its best.
It is also the key point of heresy that
distinguishes alternative spirituality from conventional faith.
Not Illuminati
Gnostics of the Mysteries designated the root of human potential by the
Greek word nous, "divine intelligence," basis of the term noetic.
The Mystery Schools were a network of regional
campuses where illumined teachers called telestai, "those who are aimed,"
taught a vast range of sciences, arts, and vocations. These illumined
teachers were most certainly NOT illuminati-type psychopaths bent on mind
control and social engineering.
They were dedicated teachers who had attained an
advanced realization of the nature of consciousness (noesis) and the
consciousness of nature (epitomized in a living being, the goddess Sophia,
also called Sapientia).
In
Fragments of a Faith Forgotten, Theosophic
scholar G.R.S. Mead restated,
"the persistent tradition in connection with
all the great Mystery-institutions was that their several founders were
the introducers of all the arts of civilization
they were the teachers
of the infant races [who] taught the arts, the nature of the gods, the
unseen worlds, cosmology, anthropology, etc."
Mead's view is echoed by S. Angus, author of
The Mystery-Religions:
"The Mysteries were the last redoubts of
Paganism to fall. Prior to that their adherents were the educators of
the ancient world."
Today it is widely argued that the Mystery
Schools of pre-Christian antiquity were think tanks for the predecessors
of the current CEOs of
the New World Order (NWO),
psychopathic control-freaks who aim to
deceive, divide, and enslave humankind.
Investigators such as
David
Icke and Michael Tsarion expostulate endlessly on the
nefarious doings of the NWO gang, making them out to be dazzling adepts of
occultism who hold the world under their spell.
Unfortunately, Icke, Tsarion and others
consistently attribute NWO methods and aims to Paganism (grossly and
ignorantly equated with Satanism) and the Mystery Schools. Nothing could be
further from the truth.
At this crucial moment in human history, when the moment comes to defeat the
NWO agenda, it is a grotesque mistake to associate the globalist psychopaths
with benevolent teachers of the Pagan Mystery Schools. There does not exist
one shred of evidence linking the latter-day NWO agenda, derived from
the Bavarian Illuminati of 1776, to those
sacred institutions of education and enlightenment.
I have repeatedly emphasized that self-styled
detectives of the NWO agenda, having failed to do their homework, wrongly
equate the rites of theocratic empowerment in ancient times with initiatory
rites in the Mysteries.
But the aim of the Mysteries was connection with
the Great Goddess,
Sophia, embodied in the earth, not social
engineering under the insane presumptions
of theocracy. Failure to make this
distinction has mislead many investigators, not to mention those who
uncritically follow them.
The fact that some modern (alleged or self-declared) Illuminati might
attribute their origins to the Mysteries does not mean it is so. In reality,
the distinguishing mark of the Illuminati today is the patent error, not to
say insanity, of their views on themselves, their power, and their origins!
The Illuminati represent the extreme distortion
of human egotism toward behaviors of psychotic deviance that threaten all
life on earth. That behavior identifies the Illuminati, regardless of what
principles and pretensions are assigned to them, and no matter what
ancient pedigree they attribute to themselves.
That behavior is what has to end right now if
humanity is to survive and thrive in an "Aquarian" world based on social
enlightenment, harmony with nature, and mutual aid.
NWO Endgame
Many developments unfolded after the Renaissance, leading to the New Age
movement (NAM) as it stands today
I cannot possibly summarize even the basic
outlines of this trajectory in a short essay. (Readers may consult TSH for a
more complete treatment.) Suffice it to say that
the
NWO agenda, if it is to be defeated, has to be seen as it relates
to the
New Age agenda.
One must ask, how are the two related? Both
present visions for a global or planet-wide society, but obviously two
extremely different conceptions of such a society.
Or are we considering one vision in two
different guises?
It has been argued that the NAM, especially in
the visionary scheme formulated by Theosophists Madame Blavatsky and
Alice A. Bailey, is nothing but a disingenuous program to sucker
people into the NWO nightmare of globalist mind control, disguised as a vast
spiritual awakening, guidance by a spiritual elite, the unity of all
religions, etc.
The prospect of
one world religion would indeed fit into
the globalist plan for planet-wide centralization and domination by a
self-elected elite, but,
-
Was the recent historical version of the
NAM platform, following Blavatsky and others, originally conceived
with that intention in mind?
-
Does the Illuminati hell of globalist
tyranny, implemented in the style that combines
1984 and
Brave New
World, incorporate for its purposes the pernicious lure of an
Aquarian heaven on earth?
One could debate endlessly on this touchy issue.
To do so would open up enough rabbit holes to
occupy a team of 1,000 researchers for decades.
For instance,
how would you determine if
the Lucis Trust - established by Alice
A. Bailey to further the aims of the Himalayan Masters of the Great
White Brotherhood (GWB), "the
externalization of
the
hierarchy" - due
to having its offices at
the United Nations, is accessory to the UN plan for world
domination, bureaucratic tyranny, destruction of national sovereignty,
elimination of personal and civil rights, etc?
In other words,
-
How can you prove that the hierarchy of
Himalayan Masters, alleged to be the "elder brothers" of humanity
who guide its long-term evolution, are not backing the NWO?
-
Or that the GWB, whether or not it is a
fiction (as I strongly suspect), is not being used as a psyop to
that end?
I assure you, anyone undertaking these issues
will have one hell of a task to sort out the players, real and fictional,
and define the agendas at play, not to mention the strategies for
implementing those agendas.
So, allow me to propose a shortcut to determine if the global endgame of the
NWO is working in lockstep with the supposed social idealism and religious
syncretism of the NAM.
The entire tentacular mess of speculations
surrounding this topic can be resolved by considering this question:
How do the NWO gang view those two key
themes of co-creation and theogeny, compared to the views and
assumptions of New Agers on the same matters?
If these two views coincide and complement each
other, we can infer that NWO orchestrations of social evil are indeed
cooperating with NAM principles, perhaps by deliberately co-opting them, or
merely due to contamination, guilt by association.
It remains then for people who place themselves
in alignment with New Age idealism to see through their own naiveté
and abandon their views, or, if possible, reclaim them from co-optation.
Let's consider in more detail the specifics of
this little exercise in spiritual discrimination.
Hijacking Truth
Around 1904, at the height of the Occult Revival in Europe - a late
ramification of the Renaissance recovery of Hermetics and Pagan mysticism -
self-styled magus
Aleister Crowley declared a code for
the
Aeon of Horus, his version of the Aquarian
Age:
"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the
Law. Love is the law, love under will."
A great deal has been made of this banal
proposition, as if it were a cosmic revelation of sorts.
Crowley himself has been ridiculously idolized
by a cult following, including David Bowie and many other denizens of
the entertainment world - as if such attention whores need a mystical
pretext for their egomania.
Crowley was a sadistic, manipulative narcissist
whose delusions of grandeur far exceeded actual skill in the magic arts -
though his delusions were to prove highly contagious.
The Book of The Law,
channeled by his wife Rose Kelly, is endlessly cited as a lofty
declaration of magical empowerment.
In fact, the above words present nothing more
than a hijacking and distortion of the Wiccan Creed:
"An it harm none, do as ye will."
Significantly, Crowley dropped the crucial
qualification, "an it harm none."
Hence, his thelemic law of magic comes across as
an unqualified call for narcissistic indulgence, regardless of how it
affects others.
The hijacking of the Wiccan Creed, and its perversion by exclusion of
crucial syntax, exemplifies how self-serving psychopaths twist genuine and
benevolent alternative spiritual principles to evil ends. Wicca is a genuine
and benevolent path of alternative spirituality and Gaian ethics, closely
aligned to the animist path of shamanism common to indigenous cultures
around the world - known crudely as "nature worship."
But whatever is potentially correct for humanity
in New Age philosophy can readily be twisted against human benefit.
Almost everything for social control proposed
under the NWO agenda today can be evaluated by asking how it adopts and
perverts some principle of the New Age movement, or a truth drawn from
indigenous wisdom.
This is especially so for the two seminal
principles that come to definition via Hermetics around 1500:
co-creation and theogeny.
Consider theogeny first: correctly understood,
this is cultivation of the divine potential inherent to the human species.
But hijacked and perverted, it turns into the
theocratic con of
the ruling elite who take themselves for
gods on earth, superhuman rulers of the world.
This is a vivid example of a NAM concept perverted into a NWO imperative.
Clearly, the behaviors generated by those who
enact this delusion will be destructive to the world at large, and
ultimately to themselves. So it goes with one of the major trends of the NWO
agenda, epitomized in the toxic
insanity of transhumanism.
Now consider that other key theme, co-creation.
According to Hermetic sciences rooted in the
Mysteries, co-creation meant the process of humanity achieving its divine
potential by working with nature, via alchemical collaboration.
Alchemists of genuine achievement, distinguished
from the many charlatans, regarded themselves as heirs of the Hermetic
sciences.
In that spirit, they advised:
"Nature performeth her operations gradually;
and indeed I would have thee do the same: let thy imagination be guided
wholly by nature.
And observe according to nature, through
whom the substances regenerate themselves in the bowels of the earth.
And imagine this with true and not with fantastic imagination."
(The Art of Goldmaking, 17th Century)
In the Mystery School tradition, which might be
considered the most reliable basis for genuine alternative spirituality in
our time, co-creation went hand in hand with theogeny.
The initiates of the Mysteries taught that
humankind has been endowed with god-like potential (divine faculties, not
divine identity) so that we can develop it within the setting of the divine
experiment on this planet, the laboratory of nature.
Clear enough, and that is about as cogent as it
gets, perhaps - but what do the NWO psychopaths contrive when they hijack
and pervert this proposition? They construct ecofascism as the cover for
their program of looting nature and keeping all the spoils for themselves.
Ecofascism is a kind of false flag attack on nature, blaming humanity for
posing a lethal threat to the environment and then demanding that humans pay
for the crime of breathing.
This ploy is an insidious perversion of the
"Great Work" of co-creation:
create a unique human reality on earth, an
Aquarian utopia, by working in harmony with nature.
Note that this principle so stated avoids the
narcissistic assumption that,
"you (alone) create your own reality."
The assertion that we as a species create
reality by using the power of imagination cooperatively with nature is a
premise of the Sophianic vision of the Mysteries, recovered today in
Planetary Tantra.
The notion that anyone creates their own reality
alone, without interaction with nature and collaboration with other people,
is a narcissistic delusion of the New Age.
Discrimination
It may appear that I have tackled the daunting issue of how NWO schemes
relate to New Age principles, including the Aquarian ideal, in a somewhat
general and roundabout manner.
But it would be impossible to make a
satisfactory analysis of particulars in an essay of this length. Also, as I
said, the number of rabbit holes to explore would be prohibitive even to a
large team of investigators.
Normally, I favor the inductive method of
Socrates: argument from individual to general cases.
But with the tricky and ambiguous issue of NWO/NAM
overlay, the grasp of generalities is essential and favors sorting out the
details and particulars of the larger picture.
In my analysis, principles and proposals of New Age or Aquarian Age
spirituality may be adopted to the NWO agenda, but they can also remain free
of that association.
It depends wholly on who is trafficking in these
principles and proposals, and for what purposes.
-
To observe that ecofascism is a hijacked
perversion of the alchemical principle of co-creation, does not mean
that alchemists were predecessors of the current ecofascist scam.
-
To observe that Gnostics taught theogeny,
our endowment of divine potential, does not mean that Gnostics were
forerunners of transhumanism and cybernetic immortality.
-
To observe that Wiccans revere nature as
a living presence does not mean that they are accessory to the
insane scheme to depopulate the world on the phony pretext of
unburdening Mother Earth.
Deep ecology also asserts that nature has an
intrinsic value on its own, regardless of it uses for human purposes.
As I show in Not in His Image, this
position is closely aligned to the Sophianic vision of the Mysteries,
holding the earth as the embodiment of a divine being, the wisdom goddess.
Any of these legitimate propositions can be
perverted to the NWO agenda of domination by the elite, but that does not
mean they were originally conceived to support such an agenda.
Let's get these issues straight on general principles. Then we will be all
the more prepared to interpret particular issues and instances in which the
NWO agenda appears to draw from alternative spirituality, Wicca, Gnosticism,
and Pagan culture.
In conclusion, I might add my personal view that the danger posed by NWO
appropriation of alternative spirituality, including shamanism and
indigenous wisdom, is amplified by the cowardice and naiveté of New Agers
who refuse to look social evil in the face.
Cocooned in their white-light jump suits of
magical thinking, New Agers and other fantasists, including proponents of "The
Secret" (below video), persist in narcissistic con-games that blind them to the
perversions of human nature to be seen in the NWO predators.
But the god-complex of the NWO psychopaths and
the self-fulfilling deification of NAM drones, are two poles of the same
festering narcissistic disease.
Whether the NWO control-freaks are using New
Age idealism or not, the vast majority of New Agers are so lacking in
discrimination, not to mention basic savvy for social observation, that they
would not even know if their precious ideals were indeed being played in
that manner.
That ignorance is the real and present danger
inherent to the New Age movement, making it the possible and plausible
accessory to insidious agendas of
social manipulation and mind control.
Ultimately, the two socio-historical trends leading toward the NWO hell and
New Age heaven might converge, which would be a huge victory for the
globalist psychopaths.
To prevent such a horrific development, one
paramount skill has to be mastered by those who embrace the New Age
philosophy of Aquarian idealism:
the skill of discrimination...
