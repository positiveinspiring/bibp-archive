One of the least discussed and least reported issues is the Obama
administrations effort to bring
the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement to
the forefront, an oppressive plurilateral US-led free trade agreement
currently being negotiated with several Pacific Rim countries.
Six hundred US corporate advisors have
negotiated and had input into the TPP, and the proposed draft text has not
been made available to the public, the press or policymakers.
The level of secrecy surrounding the agreements
is unparalleled - paramilitary teams scatter outside the premise of each
round of discussions while helicopters loom overhead - media outlets impose
a near-total blackout of reportage on the subject and US Senator Ron
Wyden, the Chair of the Congressional Committee with jurisdiction over
TPP, was denied access to the negotiation texts.
The majority of Congress is being kept in
the dark as to the substance of the TPP negotiations, while
representatives of U.S. corporations - like Halliburton, Chevron, PhaRMA,
Comcast and the Motion Picture Association of America - are being
consulted and made privy to details of the agreement, said Wyden, in a
floor statement to Congress.
In addition to the United States, the countries
participating in the negotiations include,
-
Australia
-
Brunei
-
Chile
-
Canada
-
Malaysia
-
Mexico
-
New Zealand
-
Peru
-
Singapore
-
Vietnam
Japan has expressed its desire to become a
negotiating partner, but not yet joined negotiation, partly due to public
pressure to steer-clear.
The TPP would impose punishing regulations that
give multinational corporations unprecedented rights to demand taxpayer
compensation for policies they think will undermine their expected future
profits straight from the treasuries of participating nations - it would
push
the agenda of Big PhaRMA in the developing
world to impose longer monopoly controls on drugs, drastically limiting
access to affordable generic medications that people depend on.
The TPP would undermine food safety by limiting
labeling and forcing countries like the United States to import food that
fails to meet its national safety standards, in addition to banning Buy
America or Buy Local preferences.
According to leaked draft texts, the TPP would also impose investor
protections that incentivize offshoring jobs through special benefits for
companies - the TPP stifles innovation by
requiring internet service providers to police user-activity
and treat small-scale individual downloads as large-scale for-profit
violators.
Most predictably, it would rollback regulation
of finance capital predators on Wall Street by prohibiting bans on risky
financial services and preventing signatory nations from exercising the
ability to independently pursue monetary policy and issue capital controls -
signatories must permit the free flow of derivatives, currency speculation
and other manipulative financial instruments.
The US-led partnership - which seeks to impose
Shock and Awe Globalization - aims to abolish the accountability of
multinational corporations to the governments of countries with which
they trade by making signatory governments accountable to corporations for
costs imposed by national laws and regulations, including health, safety and
environmental regulations.
The proposed legislation on Intellectual Property will have enormous
ramifications for TPP signatories, including Internet termination for
households, businesses, and organizations as an accepted penalty for
copyright infringement.
Signatory nations would essentially submit
themselves to oppressive IP restrictions designed by Hollywoods copyright
cartels, severely limiting their ability to digitally exchange information
on sites like YouTube, where streaming videos are considered copyrightable.
Broader copyright and intellectual property
rights demands by the US would lock up the Internet, stifle research and
increase education costs, by extending existing generous copyright from
70 years to 120 years, and even making it a criminal offense to
temporarily store files on a computer without authorization.
The US, as a net exporter of digital
information, would be the only party to benefit from this, said
Patricia Ranald, convener of the Australian Fair Trade and Investment
Network.
In the private investor-state that the TPP is
attempting to establish, foreign corporations can sue national governments,
submitting signatory countries to the jurisdiction of investor arbitral
tribunals, staffed by private sector attorneys.
International tribunals could have authority to
order governments to pay unlimited cash compensation out of national
treasuries to foreign corporations and investors if new or existing
government policy hinders investors expected future profits.
The domestic taxpayer in each signatory country
must shoulder any compensation paid to private investors and foreign
corporations, in addition to large hourly fees for tribunals and legal
costs.
A good example of how this agreement neuters
national sovereignty comes from Malaysia, which was able to recover from the
1997 Asian Financial Crisis more quickly than its neighbors by introducing a
series of capital control measures on the Malaysian ringgit to prevent
external speculation - the TPPs proposed measures would restrict
signatory nations from exercising capital controls to prevent and
mitigate financial crises and promote financial stability.
The TPP regime ensures that foreign investors and multinational corporations
retain full rights to undermine the sovereignty of participatory nations by
skirting domestic regulations and limiting the abilities of national
governments to issue independent economic policy.
There has never been such a sweeping corporate
assault on sovereignty, and that includes US sovereignty.
Leaked TPP documents detail how the Obama
administration intends to surrender US sovereignty to international
tribunals that operate under World Bank and UN rules to settle disputes
arising under the TPP, specifically designed to leave Congress out in the
cold while creating a judicial authority higher than the US Supreme Court.
In theory, the TPP would give international
judicial entities the authority to override US laws, allowing foreign
companies doing business in the United States the privilege of operating in
a legal environment that would give them significant economic advantages
over American companies that remain tied to US laws, placing domestic
companies who do not move offshore at a competitive disadvantage.
Facing the emergence of strong developing economies like the BRICS group and
other nations that seek greater access to industrial growth and development,
the
Obama administration realizes
that it must offer Pacific nations - who would otherwise have greater
incentives in deepening economic ties with China - an attractive stake in
the US economy.
As the Pentagon repositions its military muscle
to the Asia-Pacific region, the TPP is clearly the economic arm of the Asia
Pivot policy, roping strategic economies into a legally binding
corporate-governance regime, lured in by the promise of unfettered access to
US markets.
The Obama administration is essentially
prostituting the American consumer to foreign corporations to usher in a
deal that would impose one-size-fits all international rules that even limit
the US governments right to regulate foreign investment and the
appropriation of natural resources, solidifying a long-discussed model of
finance capital-backed global governance.
Of the 26 chapters of the proposed TPP draft text, it is reported that only
two chapters cover trade issues, related to slashing tariffs and lifting
quotas.
The TPP would obligate the federal government to
force US states to conform state laws to over a thousand pages of detailed
stipulations and constraints unrelated to trade - from land use to
intellectual property rights - authorizing the federal authorities to use
all possible means to coax states to comply with TPP rules, even by imposing
sanctions if they fail to do so.
According to
leaked documents, US standards for property rights protection
would be swept away in favor of international property rights standards, as
interpreted by TPPs unelected international tribunals, giving investors
principal control over public land and resources,
that are not for the exclusive or
predominant use and benefit of the government.
Due to the unconstitutional nature of the TPP,
members of Congress would likely object to many of its stipulations -
naturally, the Obama administration is employing its executive muscle to
restrict congressional authority by operating under fast-track authority,
a trade provision that requires Congress to review an FTA under limited
debate in an accelerated time frame subject to a yes-or-no vote so as to
assure foreign partners that the FTA, once signed, will not be changed
during the legislative process.
No formal steps have been taken to consult
Congress as the agreement continues to be negotiated, and Obama looks set to
subtly ram the treaty into law.
Such is the toxic nature of US policies that
seek to bring in disaster-capitalism on a global scale, while keeping those
whose lives will be most affected by deal completely in the dark. The
message behind this unfettered corporate smash and grab is simple - bend
over!
Recent statistics claim that the combined
economic output of Brazil, China and India will surpass that of Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States by 2020.
More than 80% of the worlds middle class will live in the South by 2030,
and what a different world that would be.
The United States is economically ailing, and
the TPP - Wall Streets wet dream and Washingtons answer to its own
dwindling economic performance - is designed to allow US big business a
greater stake in the emerging Pacific region by imposing an exploitative
economic model on signatory nations that exempt multinationals and private
investors from any form of public accountability.
The TPPs origins go back to the
second Bush administration, and it still remains in the
negotiating phases under Obamas second administration.
The overwhelming lack of transparency
surrounding the talks lends credence to what is known already - that the
contents of this trade agreement serve the interests of
those on the top of the economic food chain while the rest of us
stagnate on the menu.
