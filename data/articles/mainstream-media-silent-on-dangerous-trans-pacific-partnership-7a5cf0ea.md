# Mainstream Media Silent on Dangerous Trans-Pacific Partnership

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_tpp05.htm

Despite the many unconstitutional provisions
purportedly contained in the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
agreement, the mainstream media has ignored the subject almost entirely.
A
survey of television news coverage of the TPP reveals that a,
transcript search of
CBS Evening News with Scott Pelly,
ABC's World News with Diane Sawyer,
and NBC Nightly News with Brian
Williams from August 1, 2013 through January 31, 2014 found no mention
of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
The TPP received one mention on PBS'
Newshour, when Doug Paal of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argued that approving the TPP
would improve relations with Asian nations.
The 24-hour cable news channels have been
almost as silent.
The report indicates that,
"the three largest cable networks - CNN,
MSNBC, Fox News - covered the ongoing negotiations 33 times during
their evening programming. The overwhelming majority of these
mentions (32) originated on MSNBC and aired during
The Ed Show."
That the pro-Establishment media should
ignore a threat to the Constitution is no surprise, particularly since
their political patrons do likewise.
The problem with the information embargo on
the TPP is that there are millions of Americans who still rely on
the
so-called "mainstream media"
for their news.
Perhaps this is the precise purpose behind
the decision to keep the TPP out of the headlines and off the nightly
news.
The "Fast Track" to
Tyranny
Forbes reports,
for example, that only President Obama can close the deal on the TPP.
Part of that includes persuading Congress to
"fast track" negotiation of the TPP, in the form of a
Trade Promotion
Authority (TPA) bill. The TPA is a tool that the president demands be in
the U.S. trade representatives bag when he sits down with his
colleagues from the other TPP participants.
Again, from
Forbes:
TPA or "fast track" is essential for the
President to complete negotiations. Negotiators for our trading partners
would be foolish to sign off on a treaty unless they knew that the
Congress could not amend it.
And:
A TPA bill would allow the Trans Pacific
Partnership Treaty, said to be in its final stages, to be completed and
ratified. In addition to its trade and economic benefits, TPP is the
most prominent piece of the Obama "pivot to Asia," his attempt to
exercise more leadership in the area.
TPP is supposed to lead the region to our
version of open, reciprocal trade rather than have the region move
toward the Chinese mercantilist model.
That would be a little more believable were
it not for the fact that the president himself has entertained the
inclusion of China in the TPP.
Obama Seeks Chinese
Participation in TPP
As The New
American reported, President
Obama has signaled that he would
entertain the idea of the
Chinese communist governments partnership in the bloc.
Now, word from Taiwanese media reveals
mainland China's increasing interest in getting in on the TPPs
destruction of American economic prosperity.
After citing South Koreas interest in
joining the trade pact negotiations, the
China Post reports:
Now, China is also indicating interest.
Foreign Minister Wang Yi, while outlining diplomatic priorities for
2014, said that economic diplomacy would be a major focus of Chinese
diplomacy in the new year and that,
"China will face the member states of
the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks with an open attitude, as well
as other regional or cross-region FTA initiatives."
President Obamas fascination with
intertwining the economic welfare of the United States with China is
perhaps one reason a recent commentator called the TPP,
"another disaster from
a proven liar."
Perhaps it is this sinister ulterior motive
that has prompted the president to steadfastly protect the secrecy that
has shrouded the drafting of the TPP treaty from the beginning.
Secret Surrender of
Sovereignty
In November 2013, portions of the TPP draft
agreement published by WikiLeaks contained sketches of
President Obamas plans to surrender American sovereignty to
international tribunals.
Another WikiLeaks disclosure in January revealed that the president was attempting to surrender
sovereignty over U.S. environmental policy to international bureaucrats
interested in lowering those standards to mirror those of our TPP
partner nations.
U.S. copyright laws, Internet freedom, and
web-based publishing would also be obliterated by the TPP, and, although
it hasnt been widely reported, the TPP would give the global government
sweeping surveillance powers, as well.
Although the American people (and the people
of all nations involved in the pact) are prevented from seeing or
commenting on the treaty being ostensibly negotiated on their behalf,
multinational corporations have seats at the trading table.
While the TPP grants corporate giants such
as Walmart
and Monsanto the power to bypass Congress
and the courts, the
elected representatives of the American people are kept from even seeing
the draft version of the agreement.
As with the multitude of similar trade pacts
the United States has formed, the ultimate aim of the TPP is the
creation of a regional super government, thus the stonewalling of
federal lawmakers who dare seek to assert some sort of oversight.
Economic and
Political Integration as a Step Toward Global Government
In the case of the TPP, the zone would be
called the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP).
Members of the proposed "free trade" bloc
include all the current TPP participants:
-
Malaysia
-
Singapore
-
Japan
-
Vietnam
-
Brunei
-
Australia
-
New Zealand
-
Peru
-
Mexico
-
Chile
-
Canada
-
the United States
The regional trading partnership is intended
to establish,
"a comprehensive free trade agreement
across the region."
The ultimate goal of the TPP isnt just the
creation of an FTAAP, though.
Supporters of the deal insist that the TPP
is a,
"trade agreement designed to achieve
broad liberalization and a high degree of economic integration among
the parties."
Integration is a word that is painful to the
ears of constitutionalists and those unwilling to surrender U.S.
sovereignty to a committee of globalists who are unelected by the
American people and unaccountable to them.
Integration is an internationalist tool for
subordinating American law to the globalist bureaucracy at
the United
Nations.
Economic and political integration will push
the once independent United States of America into yet another
collectivist bloc that will facilitate the complete dissolution of our
country and our states into no more than subordinate outposts of a
one-world government.
In an article examining the devastating
effects of the TPP, William Jasper, senior editor of
The New American,
identified the end game for these globalists (read 'How
the Free Trade Agenda Is Knocking Down America') and their secretly
planned trade pacts.
Wrote Jasper:
The architects and promoters of the TPP and
FTAAP frequently point with admiration to the "integration" process of
the European Union (EU) as the model they would like to see implemented
for the Asia-Pacific rim nations.
As with the Transatlantic Trade and
Investment Partnership (TTIP), the Trans-Pacific Partnership has been
designed to follow the EU example of relentless widening and deepening,
constantly eroding national sovereignty, while building "transnational
governance" that is not restrained by the checks and balances of
national constitutions.
Equally significant is that 600 industry
lobbyists and "advisors," as well as unelected trade representatives,
are at the table, while representatives from the public at large and
businesses other than huge monopolies, are conspicuously absent.
Each of the "partners" to the pact,
including foreign corporations, would be exempted from abiding by
American laws governing trade disputes.
Moreover, the sovereignty of the United
States and the Constitutions enumeration of powers would once again be
sacrificed on the altar of global government by subordinating U.S. laws
passed by duly elected representatives of the people to a code of
regulations created by a team of transnational bureaucrats.
Americans who study the subject realize that
the redrawing of national boundaries and domestic legal processes being
carried out in secret by the globalists sitting around the TPP
negotiating table is an attack on,
If television news has its way, however,
millions of Americans whose lives will be substantially changed by the
TPP will never hear a word about it.
