# Agenda 21 and The Steady-State Techno-Corporatocracy - An Introduction

One must make a new
system
that makes the old
system obsolete.
Buckminster Fuller
Once upon a time, we worried about a possible
New World
Order. A plan to create a One World Government. We read
books and watched films that gave us glimpses of what was
coming.
These days we can feel it is
already here, as each day the tales of tyranny come thick
and fast.
Big
Brother breathes hotly down our necks
Yet still there is much dis-unity among us, a fragmentation
of interests, which leaves us vulnerable to the whims of
those who would control us.
Going forward,
exposing Agenda 21 must be our focus... because theres
a lot more to it than most people realize. Its aim is to
replace our current system with (what will be called) a
steady state economy.
Every single profitable aspect
of nature is being priced, in preparation for this system:
food, land, water, carbon, the ocean, the atmosphere, soil
formation, nutrient cycling, biomass, genetic resources,
and, yes, even the tourism value of a nice view is being
priced.
This is but one of many intangibles which are said
to have value in the economy, and includes a variety of
aesthetic, cultural and spiritual services provided by
nature.
The Global Alliance of
Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities on Climate Change
against REDD+ and for Life are living proof of the effects
of this system, and proclaim the green economy to be,
...nothing more than
capitalism of nature; a perverse attempt by
corporations, extractive industries and governments to
cash in on Creation by privatizing, commodifying, and
selling off the Sacred and all forms of life and the
sky, including the air we breathe, the water we drink
and all the genes, plants, traditional seeds, trees,
animals, fish, biological and cultural diversity,
ecosystems and traditional knowledge that make life on
Earth possible and enjoyable.
...Under
the green economy, even the rain, the beauty of a
waterfall or a honey bees pollen will be reduced to a
barcode price tag and sold to the highest bidder.
At the same time, the green
economy promotes and greenwashes environmentally and
socially devastating extractive industries like logging,
mining and oil drilling as sustainable development.

However, Agenda 21 has even more
sinister aims - part of the commodification process already
includes prices being calculated for 'Gross National Happiness.'
This involves measuring the
value provided by human capital (a corporation gets much
more profit from a fit and happy worker than one who is
chubby and depressed!), and social capital (such as having
lots of friends!).
Measuring the well-being of all peoples
will require surveillance, and mental and physical
profiling, which will then enable computer simulations to
make predictions.
Prices are being put on all of these things, even though
many of them are not normal commodities; because the value
of many of the new assets are only concepts, such as
happiness, they are classed as intangibles. These
so-called assets are wide open to statistical manipulation,
as are the range of values calculated for water, air, and
carbon.
For the steady-state system, defined and imposed on us by
the corporate and globalist elites, we will all have to be
good little consumers and producers to maintain the
prescribed degree of equilibrium, and avert the
ever-present danger of running out.
For this, we must
be surveilled: measured and assessed for our place in the
ecosystem of life.
Agenda 21 is the key to Global Government, one-world
religion, one way of life, inched forward with NewSpeak
incantations like sustainable development and rights and
responsibilities.
The bright ideas of people with good hearts are being
subverted to facilitate the ultimate in power - an "eco-fascist"
techno-corporatocracy based on eco-social currencies, with
the whole system run by a
giant quantum computer, which alone can defend the
pretense of global climate prediction, and the pretense of
managing the steady-state system, as it will be the only
computer that can.[1]
The
Full Agenda
A standardized version of Agenda 21 has been popularized
across the alternative media; as a result, most activists
understand it to be a document designed, in 1992, to be a
blueprint for global domination, using sustainable
development and zoning.
This attack on land and property
rights had a history (conservation orders, etc.) and thus
immediate implications for a number of researchers, such as,
...and many others.
Niki Raapana, and her daughter Nordica, have also worked
tirelessly to explore and explain these issues in great
detail - especially the communitarian zeitgeist which
informs global governance, and its
Fabian roots.
Raapana has personally experienced
community zoning and policing.
Patrick Wood has exposed the link between technocracy
and the environmental movement, and the involvement of the
global smart grid. He also alerts us to the likelihood of
carbon currency being introduced.
Most of the time though, the way Agenda 21 is interpreted is
as a way to control humanity by defining where and how we
live, through zoning and other restrictions brought about by
smart growth.
This, however, tells only half the story. Apart from
communitarianism, smart growth and smart grids, and
One
Religion for One World, Agenda 21 entails quantifying
natural, human, and social capital.
This involves:
-
Creating a brand new
economy from the new capital assets
-
Surveilling our
well-being
-
Social pressure to be
well, be nice, and live sustainably
-
De-growth (in the West),
to ensure balance and avert scarcity
-
Ownership of all
resources, and even concepts
-
Genetically modified
organisms
-
Staggeringly large
biomass monocultures, such as algae
-
The façade of community
- biozones will feature specialized production
clusters, to maximize efficiency.

Its time now to bring all these
threads together, and to see Agenda 21 as the blueprint for
the steady state system, a concept which stems from
Fabianism, and has evolved to encompass ecological
economics, and the technocratic method.
Throughout, we see the influence
of
the Rockefellers and
the Club of Rome - a self-indulgent
dogma
for the elite, designed to engineer their very own
Utopia.[2]
Man's conquest of Nature, if
the dreams of some scientific planners are realized,
means the rule of a few hundreds of men over billions
upon billions of men.
There neither is nor can be
any simple increase of power on Man's side. Each new
power won by man is a power over man as well.
C. S. Lewis,
The Abolition of Man
(1943)
The Steady-State System
Agenda 21 is but one strand of a global effort to
entirely alter the global system.
Our lives are to be
scientifically micro-managed in order to ensure balance -
births are to equal deaths, consumption is to equal
production, or at least, thats what well be told. Its
called a steady state system, and nature, and the global
stock of human capital, are already being commodified in
preparation for this system.
The fiat economy is to be
replaced with regional, and global, currencies based upon
the exchange of energy.
The science of caring for the earth, and for each other,
will be our new religion. This means counting your carbon as
well as your calories, and foregoing self-interest for the
sake of future generations.
Earth is being incorporated, and stock taking will entail
monitoring all transactions which may affect the overall
balance; this requires technocratic management of (the new)
capital assets, of identities, and of energy, aka the
smartgrid and the internet of things.
The techno-corporatocracy will be overseen by a
quantum
super-computer, whose decisions cannot be questioned, since
there will be no computer more powerful than it.
This has already been achieved
by the global warming is all about carbon heist - the
science is settled. From now on, its all a question
of optimization. Or so they say.
The powerful bankers and corporations who promote the Green
Economy have been busy acquiring land and other forms of
natural capital for decades, such as through
debt-for-nature swaps.
The Smart World Order will use
this natural capital to create a perpetual stock of
assets, and profit from huge GM biomass monocultures,[3]
which can be used to make fuel, paint, plastic, etc., and
perpetuate the myth of maintaining a balanced ecosystem,
such as through the
Cradle to Cradle® scheme. [4]
Most of these monocultures will
be in the developing world, where the infrastructure is
being upgraded, to make the production line more efficient.
As this is achieved, the workers need to be kept just as
happy as their Western counterparts, as this is an
essential requirement of optimal production.
As Alan Watt has
described, all we need is a smart-phone, so we can be kept
happy and distracted from our austerity, but tracked and
traced for the global economy and homeland security.
Thus the owners and over-seers will continue their rampage
of destruction, and call it caring for the earth.
The theories of the steady state
economy will merely be used to justify and control further
plunder of the earths resources. Theres no doubt, after
all, that the earth is being despoiled, so it is all the
more shocking that the billionaires and very-unsustainable
corporations have been allowed to control the green agenda,
and milk it for all its worth.
Were never going to know when
were in equilibrium, because we will never be able to
find out.
The knowledge will be in the hands of the quantum
controllers,
Although most of the people who have advanced the
environmental movement to its current state are likely
honorable and caring, it is untenable to claim the same can
be said of the hordes of mega-rich who have financed and
promoted the cause.
They have taken the ideas of
people with passion, and used them to extend, promote, and
defend the consolidation of power that comes with the
acquisition of natural resources.

Notes
[1] In a
TED talk (below video)on quantum computing, Michelle Simmons
indicates the power of these computers, measured by qubits:
30 qubits is more powerful than a supercomputer but...
300 quibits would be more powerful than all the
computers in the world connected together.
This
indicates the advantage held by Google, NASA, and the
non-profit Universities Space Research Association (USRA)
who are now running the new 512-qubit
D-Wave Two quantum computer. (Source)
[2] Articles to follow this will,
(i) explain and
critique steady-state economics
(ii) postulate on the
next revolution, based on natural capital and biomass
for the circular economy
(iii) attempt a full
history of Agenda 21, a sort of before and after
(over a century), which sets it in context,
explaining how it came about and, more importantly,
who has funded it
[3] There is even scope to classify nuclear energy as
renewable; so beware of the label 'cleantech'!
[4] The
Cradle-to-Cradle® design, part of the circular
economy idea, includes biomass in its certification,
and is used to excuse planned obsolescence.
