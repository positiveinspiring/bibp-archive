# Wealth Gap - 10% of Americans Own 91% - But the Queen and Rothschilds 
Still Own Almost Everything...

Are you fighting for your servitude as if for your
salvation?
Then you have been well-deceived. You have been sheeple-compromised. Your thoughts are not your own. Your
actions are not your own. You are in all ways a conditioned
puppet who is under the delusion that it is free, and the
psychopaths of the world are your uncompromising puppet
masters.
Gary 'Z' McGee
Every few months for the last couple of years, a new story
pops up declaring the
"official" wealth gap
- the one most public sources will
admit to - is getting wider and wider at a faster and faster
rate.
This is the
real economic crisis. The wealth gap in America, for example, is insane these days.
Check out this fresh report from
Nation of Change (an ironic name considering the topic):
Just 10 percent of Americans own 91 percent
of the nation's stocks and mutual funds, according to
economist
Edward Wolff (Table 7).
Most of the remainder is held by
a "middle class" that is steadily losing ground. The bottom
60 percent is almost entirely shut out (Table 2).
Stock owners, some of whom made billions of
dollars
last year, can defer their income taxes indefinitely,
pay a reduced capital gains tax when they decide to cash in,
or pass on the capital gains
tax-free to their heirs
$2 of every $5 owned today was created in the last
five years, most of it from the financial markets, and
almost all of it going to the richest 10 percent.
Unfathomably, the richest 1 percent took anywhere from
95 percent to
116 percent of the new income gains after the recession.
Yes, 116 percent, because almost everyone else went
backwards.
Median wealth dropped about
40 percent from 2007 to 2013.
And it just keeps getting worse.
Remember that big report that came
out last year about how the 85 richest people in the world -
only 85 people - own as much wealth as the bottom 3.5
BILLION poorest?
This isn't set up to let
more people
get in the club fake American dream style either. Only people
who are still asleep believe that.
No, the elite are closing ranks. The report about the 85
versus 3.5 billion came out in January 2014. It was quickly
followed up by a new report just a couple months later that it
was down to a mere 67 people
sixty-seven people
who own more than the bottom
half of everybody in the whole entire world.
The number is likely smaller now.
But Who Are the Real Owners?
This number, as most of us have come to realize, is totally
skewed anyway because no one anywhere in traditional media print
wants to admit that the real owners (as
George Carlin would call them) - the 0.0000001% of whatever
they are - own so much wealth most of us cannot conceive of
numbers that big without frying our grey brain matter like eggs
on the sidewalk in Hell.
Facts like the
Queen of England is truly one of the world's richest people
and the world's largest land owner, with holdings worth
approximately Â£17,600,000,000,000.
Although an estimate is hard
to truly make because she has a lot of proxies, it is estimated
that woman is worth some obscene amount like $33 trillion
(that's trillion, with a 'T').
Of course, someone did
the math on that figure back in 2007, nearly a decade ago, so
who knows what the number is now.
She nominally owns
6.6 billion acres of land on a planet that only has 36.8
billion acres of inhabitable land. She has so much money at this
point that she has no clue what a hundred bucks means to the
average human being if she ever did.
This woman could literally
end world poverty and hunger all by herself if she wanted to.
It's that much.
Think about that - we live in a world where
one person can
own 1/6 of the land on the entire planet and so much money no
one would have to be poor or suffer, but hey,
-
Where's the power
in that?
-
On an aside, did you know
she controls uranium the way De Beers controls diamonds?
-
Speaking of De Beers, did you know that company was founded
on Rothschild capital?
-
Who are the Rothschilds? Why, the people who own the Queen.
Yes,
the Rothschilds.
Now we're talking numbers like $500
trillion. That's half a QUADRILLION dollars. I couldn't even
begin to tell you how to visualize that in terms that make
mental sense. Just know that more than half the wealth that
exists on this planet, they own.
Now we're talking about people who aren't even on the list
over at Forbes. There's a reason. Mostly it's because then
Forbes wouldn't have a list.
Just
watch this:
The world cannot continue this way forever.
There are way
more poor people than rich and the latter group is dwindling
further and further all the time.
Pretty soon that huge number of poor are going to start to
wonder why they can never catch a break, why they should even
try
and why so few are making life-changing decisions for so
many based on their immense wealth.
People like
Bill Gates with all his vaccines and population control
agenda,
Warren Buffett with his smart grid enslavement,
George Soros buying civil unrest by the millions, and
Michael Bloomberg buying gun control come immediately to
mind.
More and more people are going to start to wonder who owns
them
and why
and how do they ever get truly free from
this utterly corrupt world order system?
