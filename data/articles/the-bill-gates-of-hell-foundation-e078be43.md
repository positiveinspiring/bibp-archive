Why mince words when the planet's
being destroyed and we're all being systematically murdered?
When it finally dawns on you what
these New World Order elite globalists are up to it can be staggering.
And it can't be more in your face
than it is right now.
We have
chemtrails continually 'playing' on the
world's biggest screen, our skies - horrific displays of absolute disregard
for all things living. And yet the majority doesn't even see them and
there's total silence about it from authorities and the media.
Flocks of birds are falling from the sky and millions of dead fish are
washing up on our shores, and they all act dumb, like they have no idea what
the hell is going on.
The Gulf of Mexico has been killed, the vital loop current disrupted, the
weather shot to hell, the food and water are deliberately poisoned and
altered, and then they screw with the stratosphere and magnetosphere with a
host of devilish devices.
Never mind the deliberately trashed economy and the fabricated 'war
on terror' while the police state clampdown continues.
And we're not supposed to notice?... or think this is deliberate destruction
of our world?
Enter the Two Man Wrecking
Crew
And so they trot out a "friendly, respectable face" for this deliberate
destruction and depopulation, hoping we won't notice the havoc being wreaked
in front of our eyes, all the while making us think they're doing us a favor
and 'pioneering our future'.
...And with a message straight
from
the Bilderbergers which seems to say..
'It's time to step up the depopulation plan'...
So good, so clean, so 'successful', so giving...
Right...
Bill and Melinda Gates Tapped
To Be "The Friendly Face of Eugenics"
As F. William Engdahl in
Financial Sense
wrote:
Microsoft founder and one of the worlds wealthiest men,
Bill Gates,
projects an image of a benign philanthropist using his billions via his (tax
exempt) Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to tackle diseases, solve food
shortages in Africa and alleviate poverty.
In a recent conference in
California, Gates reveals a less public agenda of his
philanthropy -
population reduction, otherwise known as eugenics.
Gates made his remarks to the invitation-only Long Beach, California
TED-2010
Conference, in a speech titled, Innovating to Zero!.
Along with the
scientifically absurd proposition of reducing man-made CO2 emissions
worldwide to zero by 2050, approximately four and a half minutes into the
talk, Gates declares,
First we got population. The world
today has 6.8 billion people. Thats headed up to about 9 billion.
Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care,
reproductive health services, we lower that by perhaps 10 or 15
percent.
Hard To Believe?
Watch this clip for yourself if you haven't seen it yet, as he builds
false premise upon false premise, like they all do as if we're stone cold
idiots, and then he gives his chilling solution on how to "Innovate to
Zero"...
The Decade of Death
By the way, they've set a goal for their vaccine program they love so much.
Is this a signal to their own?
Bill and Melinda Gates Pledge $10 Billion in Call for Decade of Vaccines
DAVOS, Switzerland
Bill and Melinda Gates announced today that their
foundation will commit $10 billion over the next 10 years to help research,
develop and deliver vaccines for the worlds poorest countries.
...said
Melinda Gates, Weve made vaccines our number-one priority at the
Gates Foundation because weve seen firsthand their incredible impact on
childrens lives.

"Incredible impact", alright.
And Not Just Vaccines,
Folks...
Besides vaccines, the Gates are funding
10 different projects researching
new contraception methods, including their latest that involves sterilizing
men by putting ultrasound on their testes. (Nice one, Bill. Hope you're
trying it out nightly.)
But more importantly, the Gates of Hell also fund two other major thrusts
towards the destruction of earth's eco-system and the extermination of its
inhabitants:
'Bill Gates's Hidden Dreams of Geoengineering Revealed'
Bill Gates has already proven his interest in geoengineering schemes with
his earlier
co-patent filing for reducing the intensity of killer
hurricanes.
So perhaps we're not too surprised that
Science Insider has dug
up the Microsoft chairman's past projects on altering the Earth's climate,
ranging from filtering carbon dioxide to reflecting sunlight via brighter
clouds.

And...
'Gates Foundation Funded Approval of Genetically
Modified Mosquitos'
Bill Gates, who recently bought
500,000 shares of Monsanto stock, is reportedly funding the approval of
genetically modified mosquitoes.
It seems that not only will genetically
modified salmon enter the environment along with unforeseen changes, but
a new self-sterilizing mosquito may be joining them.
The plan, concocted by United Nations' Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs, involves creating genetically modified mosquitoes
that either kill or sterilize themselves.
The United Nations aim is to
combat Dengue fever through the genetic manipulation of nature.
As with other genetically modified organisms, the long-term
repercussions are widely unknown, and introducing a genetically modified
creature into the environment may make for the genetic coding of an
entire species to be altered.

The Monsanto
Connection
Besides funding and profiting tax free from this horrific company, there's
an 'image problem' there too for which they're trying to use
Bilderberg Bill
and Melinda.
The immediate impact of these partnerships is to enhance the public image of
Gene Giants that are donating royalty-free genes to needy farmers.
But the
longer-term goal is to create the enabling environments (bio-safety
regulations, intellectual property laws, positive media coverage to promote
public acceptance) that will support the market introduction of genetically
engineered crops and related technologies.
Its a package deal wrapped in
a philanthropic fa√ßade - and it comes with strings attached

The Elite Call To Arms?
For those of you 'awake and aware' to what's going on, that the world's
self-appointed 'elite' are planning a great 'culling of the herd' comes as
no surprise. What's remarkable is how blatant they've become about the
subject.
This possibly denotes two things:
-
They feel comfortable with how well
they've programmed and entranced most of society to accept such
nonsense as
global warming and carbon footprints, never mind the
mythical 'war on terror' and a host of other lies
-
They're signaling to their own the program's ratcheting up
And the Bill and Melinda Gates (of Hell)
Foundation is the new poster child
and sanitizing ploy.
But while every effort is being made to give the Gates
Foundation a benign, philanthropic appearance, their primary program is
clearly population reduction, just wrapped in brighter elitist "do gooder"
package.
"Awwwww. Look how they're giving back and leading these new
technologies..."
Right... just wait and see.
But they're throwing everything at it. And telling the others it's time to
throw in as well.
"A Time To Give, Brethren"
President Barack Obama met with Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. Chairman Warren Buffett and Microsoft Corp. co-founder
Bill Gates this morning at the White House to discuss the economy and
the billionaires philanthropic endeavors, an administration official
said.
Obama called for the Oval Office meeting, which also included Gates
wife, Melinda, to discuss the Giving Pledge project, started by Buffett
and Gates to encourage wealthy U.S. individuals and families to give
most of their fortunes to charity, the administration official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.

Why not...
The
old money will soon be worthless
when we go through the 'transition' they have planned for us.
"Use it for a
good cause men. We're going to make the earth our own private country club!"
Other Signs
Still wondering?
Why do you suppose they just locked up supplies of all the
world's natural seeds in
an underground vault in Norway, but are busy
altering the genetic make up of the seeds WE'RE supposed to eat?
Think about that.
Norway seed vault
And why are they feverishly burrowing their monstrous underground
cites
while trashing the environment on the surface of the earth?
Oh, you don't know about that?
Or don't believe it or "they woulda
told us"?
Please, pull your head out.
Are they preparing to board their
underground 'arks'?
Yeah, it's ugly stuff to hear about.
Would you rather just let the
train run over you and I and others not say anything?
Sorry to say, this isn't theory, it's fact.
Read up on "depopulation" and "eugenics" and
you'll find this has been their MO for centuries, periodically "culling the
herd" with wars and epidemics, gutted economies and famines, all while
keeping the world in one form of social slavery or another.
It's nothing
new. It's just that the expanding growth of humanity is accelerating at such
a rate, our numbers frighten them, and besides, they want all those
resources for themselves.
Have you noticed they tend to hoard slightly?
The Rothschilds alone are
worth an estimated 500 trillion dollars... with a 'T'. The
queen of England
and the Vatican could bail out AND support half the world.
They're not real big on sharing if you haven't noticed, yet they make you
feel guilty for devouring the earth's resources.
Why believe anything they say?
Useless Eaters
The Herd
This is how they view us.
We're now chillingly referred to as "human
resources".
Spot your social 'security' number?
Epilogue
Bill Gates is one of many
eugenicists, but he's channeling gobs of money and
a lot of perceived clout, and apparently they think he has the image to pull
this off.
That global warming and the other scams still have such traction is hard to
believe, but that's the image the media is portraying. And people are
swallowing it, I'm sorry to say, and will likely sit back and watch our
demise and blame themselves for it.
A neighbor mentioned the weird yesterday
and added,
"Do you think it's God's way of punishing us for what we've done
to the planet?"
I know. Lunacy. It's endemic.
The manipulated masses have been so dumbed down and indoctrinated, if the
adulterated planet doesn't kill them, they will practically volunteer for
death to reduce their carbon footprint. That's the cumulative effect and
logical deduction you could arrive at. And it's all by design.
It's amazing to behold. People get all snotty about their energy saving
Prius or recycling efforts, while joining hands and singing kumbaya with
benign exterminator Bill and his conniving ilk over 'the woes of global
warming and human swarming'.
Little do they know what their "final solution"
really is.
This mass mind manipulation of guilt and lies is the drumbeat of the elites,
while we sw-allow their planet destroying programs and march into the
chemtrail sunset trying to eliminate our carbon footprints.
Only one way to do that...
How manipulated are
you?
Stay conscious. They're spraying hard, closing down on our food supply, and
more fabricated troubles are on their way.
Keep your loved ones close and
spread the word to the hungry.
