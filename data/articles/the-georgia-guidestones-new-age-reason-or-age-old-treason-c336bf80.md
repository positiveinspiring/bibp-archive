Eastwood Goes to Granite City Elberton, Georgia, USA March 7, 1999
If you know your Hebrew ...then you know what this 16 foot tall, 21 ton hunk of granite says. If not, perhaps you will have a better time reading it in Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, or even Swahili? Still no?
Well, don't be concerned, because the folks that spent all that money to erect this modern "Stonehenge" wanted to make sure that everyone could read it and understand its message...
The Ten Commandments for the New Age were provided to the world back in March 1980 by "a small group of Americans who seek The Age of Reason".
Oh, my... what's this?
The first commandment says we need a population of only 500 million people on the Earth. Gee, that's only about 9% of what we currently have worldwide... Does this mean that 9 out of 10 people that I know today must die for a better tomorrow? Am I one who needs to be terminated for the good of Mother Gaia? Well, I suppose they've been warning us for years:
In order to stabilize world population, we must eliminate 350,000 per day. - Dr. Jacques Cousteau
The ten commandments are as follows:
Maintain humanity under five hundred million in perpetual balance with nature Guide reproduction wisely, improving fitness and diversity Unite humanity with a living new language Rule passion, faith, tradition, and all things with tempered reason Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts Let all nations rule internally, resolving external disputes in a world court Avoid petty laws an useless officials Balance personal rights with social duties Prize truth, beauty, love...seeking harmony with the infinite Be not a cancer on earth...leave room for nature...

Avoid petty laws an useless officials
Balance personal rights with social duties
Prize truth, beauty, love...seeking harmony with the infinite
Be not a cancer on earth...leave room for nature...
Here is the message
"Let These Be Guidestones to an Age of Reason"
written in Classical Greek, one of four dead languages used on the capstone. The others are Babylonian Cuneiform, Egyptian Hieroglyphics and Sanskrit. Why the dead languages? I suppose those civilizations are thought to have given way to newer, more advanced ones... Is that what we are being asked to do? This granite plaque tells us a little more about the author: R. C. Christian (a pseudonyn).
They misspelled it, not me!
They also buried a time capsule six feet deep but neglected to carve the burial or excavation dates! What did they bury for a future generation to find?
Further Information
This neo-megalithic site is an intricate and well-designed astronomical observatory built of granite in 1979 near the small town of Elberton under the direction of the pseudonymous "R. C. Christian," who presumably named himself after "Christian Rosenkreutz," the pseudonymous 17th century author of "The Chemical Wedding." In addition to astro-calendrical features, it also boasts didactic New Age messages of the "ten commandments" type in numerous languages. The Guidestones are located just outside of Elberton, in Georgia. They weigh a total of 237,746 lbs, and were carved using thermal lances rather than using water-jets. The lettering was then carved into the stones to carry the various messages. The stones themselves site on slabs which are flush with the surface, and the entire site was, when visited, located in a pasture. The Gnomen, or Center Stone, has a small window through its center which is aligned with the Pole Star. This alignment changes over the years, so that the star will not always be in the center of the view. This is unlike the UMR Polar window, which was made large enough to retain the star position for the next 4,000 years. At an erosion rate of one inch every thousand years, it is our hope that by that time the window will have grown to accommodate any additional size changes required.
