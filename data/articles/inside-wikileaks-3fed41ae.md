Julian Assange report by Mark Davis

Dateline's Mark Davis was filming as Assange prepared to release his massive
cache of highly classified US documents and as he weathered the media storm
that followed.
The documents reveal hundreds of civilian
casualties, secret hit squads to track and kill Taliban leaders, a steep
increase in Taliban attacks, and collusion between Pakistan's intelligence
service and the Taliban leadership.
Davis first connected with the mysterious
whistleblower in Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Australia for a story broadcast
in May, called The Whistleblower.
This time he has been filming in London where
Assange was working with journalists from The Guardian, The New York Times
and Germany's Der Spiegel.
The release of the documents has rocked the
White House and drawn comment from Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard.
Some of the classified reports refer to
Australia's military operations in
Afghanistan.
In a move that will further shake governments
and top military brass around the world, WikiLeaks says they have delayed
the release of a further 15,000 reports, but these will eventually be
released in full.
Hero or villain, Julian Assange stunned the world when he leaked more than
90,000 war files.
Accompanying Assange through every step of the unfolding
drama, this report reveals a man on a mission.
"We get attacked not in proportion to
whatever we are doing wrong or doing right, but in proportion to the
impact that our material is having. They'll attack the messenger and try
to discolour the message by proxy."
Shaking off claims that he has endangered lives,
Assange is determined:
"this historical archive belongs to the
people of Afghanistan".
Speaking from a temporary HQ in London, Assange
and his nomadic team may be staying on the move, but they don't plan on
staying in hiding.
Packing up his rucksack and heading 'to the bunker in The
Guardian' to prepare for the release, the whistleblower is stoic:
"My function in Wikileaks is to take all the
heat. I've had my baptismal fire".
And he isn't showing signs of stopping;
threatening to release a further 15,000 reports, his message is clear:
"stay tuned".
