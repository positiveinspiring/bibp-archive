WASHINGTON
Since 2010, the National Security Agency (NSA)
has been exploiting its huge collections of data to create sophisticated
graphs of some Americans' social connections that can identify their
associates, their locations at certain times, their traveling companions
and other personal information, according to newly disclosed documents
and interviews with officials.
The spy agency began allowing the analysis
of phone call and e-mail logs in November 2010 to examine Americans'
networks of associations for foreign intelligence purposes after NSA
officials lifted restrictions on the practice, according to documents
provided by
Edward J. Snowden, the former NSA
contractor.
The policy shift was intended to help the
agency "discover and track" connections between intelligence targets
overseas and people in the United States, according to an NSA memorandum
from January 2011.
The agency was authorized to conduct
"large-scale graph analysis on very large sets of communications
metadata without having to check foreignness" of every e-mail address,
phone number or other identifier, the document said.
Because of concerns about infringing on the
privacy of American citizens, the computer analysis of such data had
previously been permitted only for foreigners.
The agency can augment the communications
data with material from public, commercial and other sources, including
bank codes, insurance information,
Facebook profiles, passenger manifests,
voter registration rolls and GPS location information, as well as
property records and unspecified tax data, according to the documents.
They do not indicate any restrictions on the
use of such "enrichment" data, and several former senior Obama
administration officials said the agency drew on it for both Americans
and foreigners.
This slide from an
NSA PowerPoint presentation
shows one of the ways
the agency uses e-mail and phone data
to analyze the
relationships of foreign intelligence targets.
NSA officials declined to say how many
Americans have been caught up in the effort, including people involved
in no wrongdoing.
The documents do not describe what has
resulted from the scrutiny, which links phone numbers and e-mails in a
"contact chain" tied directly or indirectly to a person or organization
overseas that is of foreign intelligence interest.
The new disclosures add to the growing body
of knowledge in recent months about the NSA's access to and use of
private information concerning Americans, prompting lawmakers in
Washington to call for reining in the agency and President Obama
to order an examination of its surveillance policies.
Almost everything about the agency's
operations is hidden, and the decision to revise the limits concerning
Americans was made in secret, without review by the nation's
intelligence court or any public debate.
As far back as 2006, a Justice Department
memo warned of the potential for the "misuse" of such information
without adequate safeguards.
An agency spokeswoman, asked about the
analyses of Americans' data, said,
"All data queries must include a foreign
intelligence justification, period."
"All of NSA's work has a foreign
intelligence purpose," the spokeswoman added. "Our activities are
centered on counterterrorism, counter-proliferation and
cyber-security."
The legal underpinning of the policy change,
she said, was a 1979 Supreme Court ruling that Americans could have no
expectation of privacy about what numbers they had called.
Based on that ruling, the Justice Department
and the Pentagon decided that it was permissible to create contact
chains using Americans' "metadata," which includes the timing, location
and other details of calls and e-mails, but not their content.
The agency is not required to seek warrants
for the analyses from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
NSA officials declined to identify which
phone and e-mail databases are used to create the social network
diagrams, and the documents provided by Mr. Snowden do not specify them.
The agency did say that the large database of Americans' domestic phone
call records, which was revealed by Mr. Snowden in June and caused
bipartisan alarm in Washington, was excluded.
(NSA officials have previously acknowledged
that the agency has done limited analysis in that database, collected
under provisions of the Patriot Act, exclusively for people who
might be linked to terrorism suspects.)
But the agency has multiple collection
programs and databases, the former officials said, adding that the
social networking analyses relied on both domestic and international
metadata.
They spoke only on the condition of
anonymity because the information was classified.
The concerns in the United States since Mr.
Snowden's revelations have largely focused on the scope of the agency's
collection of the private data of Americans and the potential for abuse.
But the new documents provide a rare window into what the NSA actually
does with the information it gathers.
A series of agency PowerPoint presentations
and memos describe how the NSA has been able to develop software and
other tools - one document cited a new generation of programs that
"revolutionize" data collection and analysis - to unlock as many secrets
about individuals as possible.
The spy agency, led by Gen. Keith B.
Alexander, an unabashed advocate for more weapons in the hunt for
information about the nation's adversaries, clearly views its
collections of metadata as one of its most powerful resources.
NSA analysts can exploit that information to
develop a portrait of an individual, one that is perhaps more complete
and predictive of behavior than could be obtained by listening to phone
conversations or reading e-mails, experts say.
Phone and e-mail logs, for example, allow
analysts to identify people's friends and associates, detect where they
were at a certain time, acquire clues to religious or political
affiliations, and pick up sensitive information like regular calls to a
psychiatrist's office, late-night messages to an extramarital partner or
exchanges with a fellow plotter.
"Metadata can be very revealing," said
Orin S. Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University.
"Knowing things like the number someone
just dialed or the location of the person's cell-phone is going to
allow them to assemble a picture of what someone is up to. It's the
digital equivalent of tailing a suspect."
The NSA had been pushing for more than a
decade to obtain the rule change allowing the analysis of Americans'
phone and e-mail data.
Intelligence officials had been frustrated
that they had to stop when a contact chain hit a telephone number or
e-mail address believed to be used by an American, even though it might
yield valuable intelligence primarily concerning a foreigner who was
overseas, according to documents previously disclosed by Mr. Snowden.
NSA officials also wanted to employ the
agency's advanced computer analysis tools to sift through its huge
databases with much greater efficiency.
The agency had asked for the new power as
early as 1999, the documents show, but had been initially rebuffed
because it was not permitted under rules of the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court that were intended to protect the privacy of
Americans.
A 2009 draft of an NSA inspector general's
report suggests that contact chaining and analysis may have been done on
Americans' communications data under the Bush administration's program
of wiretapping without warrants, which began after the Sept. 11 attacks
to detect terrorist activities and skirted the existing laws governing
electronic surveillance.
In 2006, months after the wiretapping
program was
disclosed by The New York Times, the
NSA's acting general counsel wrote a letter to a senior Justice
Department official, which was also leaked by Mr. Snowden, formally
asking for permission to perform the analysis on American phone and
e-mail data.
A Justice Department memo to the attorney
general noted that the "misuse" of such information "could raise serious
concerns," and said the NSA promised to impose safeguards, including
regular audits, on the metadata program.
In 2008,
the Bush administration gave its
approval.
A new policy that year (2008), detailed in
"Defense Supplemental Procedures Governing Communications Metadata
Analysis," authorized by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and
Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey, said that since the Supreme
Court had ruled that metadata was not constitutionally protected, NSA
analysts could use such information,
"without regard to the nationality or
location of the communicants," according to an internal NSA
description of the policy.
After that decision, which was previously
reported by The Guardian, the NSA performed the social network graphing
in a pilot project for 1Â½ years "to great benefit," according to the
2011 memo.
It was put in place in November 2010 in "Sigint
Management Directive 424" (sigint refers to signals intelligence).
In the 2011 memo explaining the shift, NSA
analysts were told that they could trace the contacts of Americans as
long as they cited a foreign intelligence justification. That could
include anything from ties to terrorism, weapons proliferation or
international drug smuggling to spying on conversations of foreign
politicians, business figures or activists.
Analysts were warned to follow existing
"minimization rules," which prohibit the NSA from sharing with other
agencies names and other details of Americans whose communications are
collected, unless they are necessary to understand foreign intelligence
reports or there is evidence of a crime.
The agency is required to obtain a warrant
from the intelligence court to target a "U.S. person" - a citizen or
legal resident - for actual eavesdropping.
The NSA documents show that one of the main
tools used for chaining phone numbers and e-mail addresses has the code
name Mainway. It is a repository into which vast amounts of data flow
daily from the agency's fiber-optic cables, corporate partners and
foreign computer networks that have been hacked.
The documents show that significant amounts
of information from the United States go into Mainway.
An internal NSA bulletin, for example, noted
that in 2011 Mainway was taking in 700 million phone records per day. In
August 2011, it began receiving an additional 1.1 billion cell-phone
records daily from an unnamed American service provider under Section
702 of the 2008 FISA Amendments Act, which allows for the collection of
the data of Americans if at least one end of the communication is
believed to be foreign.
The overall volume of metadata collected by
the NSA is reflected in the agency's secret 2013 budget request to
Congress.
The budget document, disclosed by Mr.
Snowden, shows that the agency is pouring money and manpower into
creating a metadata repository capable of taking in 20 billion "record
events" daily and making them available to NSA analysts within 60
minutes.
The spending includes support for the
"Enterprise Knowledge System," which has a $394 million multiyear budget
and is designed to,
"rapidly discover and correlate complex
relationships and patterns across diverse data sources on a massive
scale," according to a 2008 document.
The data is automatically computed to speed
queries and discover new targets for surveillance.
A top-secret document titled "Better Person
Centric Analysis" describes how the agency looks for 94 "entity types,"
including phone numbers, e-mail addresses and IP addresses.
In addition, the NSA correlates 164
"relationship types" to build social networks and what the agency calls
"community of interest" profiles, using queries like "travelsWith,
hasFather, sentForumMessage, employs."
A 2009 PowerPoint presentation provided more
examples of data sources available in the "enrichment" process,
including location-based services like GPS and TomTom, online social
networks, billing records and bank codes for transactions in the United
States and overseas.
At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing
on Thursday, General Alexander was asked if the agency ever collected or
planned to collect bulk records about Americans' locations based on
cell-phone tower data.
He replied that it was not doing so as part
of the call log program authorized by the Patriot Act, but said a fuller
response would be classified.
If the NSA does not immediately use the
phone and e-mail logging data of an American, it can be stored for later
use, at least under certain circumstances, according to several
documents.
One 2011 memo, for example, said that after
a court ruling narrowed the scope of the agency's collection, the data
in question was "being buffered for possible ingest" later.
A year earlier, an internal briefing paper
from the NSA Office of Legal Counsel showed that the agency was allowed
to collect and retain raw traffic, which includes both metadata and
content, about "U.S. persons" for up to five years online and for an
additional 10 years offline for "historical searches."
