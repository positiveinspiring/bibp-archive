Collapse

Alessio Rastani: ...it's going to crash and
it's going to fall pretty hard. Because markets are ruled right now by
fear.
Investors and the big money, the smart money ...I'm talking about
the big funds, the hedge funds, the institutions, they don't buy this
rescue plan. They basically know that the market is toast.
They know
that the stock market is finished, the Euro as far as they're concerned
they don't really care, they're moving their money away to safer assets
like Treasury bonds, 30 year bonds, and the US dollar.
So it's not going
to
work.
Maxine Croxall: We keep hearing that whatever the politicians are
suggesting - it's all been rather wooly - isn't right. Can you pin
down exactly what would keep investors happy, make them feel more
confident?
Alessio Rastani: Ah, that's a tough one. Personally, it doesn't matter.
I'm a trader, I don't really care about that kind of stuff. If I see an
opportunity to make money, I go with that.
So for most traders we don't
really care that much how they're going to fix the economy, how they're
going to fix the whole situation. Our job is to make money from it and
personally I've been dreaming of this moment for three years.
Personally, I have a confession to make, I go to bed every night and I
dream of another recession. I dream of another moment like this.
Why?
Because people don't seem to maybe remember, but the '30's depression,
the Depression of the '30's wasn't just about a market crash.
There were
some people who were prepared to make money from that crash and I think
anybody can do that. It isn't just for some people in
the elite, anybody
can actually make money, it's an opportunity. When the market crashes,
when the Euro and the big stock markets crash, if you know what to do,
if you have the right plan to set up you can make a lot of money from
this.
For example, hedging strategies is one, then investing in bonds,
Treasury bonds that sort of stuff.
Maxine Croxall: If you could see the people around me, jaws have
collectively dropped at what you've just said. I mean we appreciate your
candor, but it doesn't help the rest of us does it, or the rest of the Eurozone.
Alessio Rastani: I will say this, listen. I would say this to everybody
who's watching this, this economic crisis is like a cancer. If you just
wait and wait thinking this is going to go away, just like a cancer it's
going to grow and it will be too late.
What I would say to everybody is get
prepared.
This is not a time right now to wishful think that
the
Government is going to sort things out. The Governments don't rule the
world,
Goldman Sachs rules the world. Goldman Sachs does not care about
this rescue package neither does the big funds. So actually, I would
actually tell people, I want to help people.
People can make money from
this, it isn't just traders. What they need to do is learn about how to
make money from a downward market. The first thing people should do is
protect their assets, protect what they have because in less than 12
months, my prediction is that savings of millions of people is going to
vanish and this is just the beginning.
So I would say, be prepared and
act now. The biggest risk people can take right now is not acting.
Maxine Croxall: Alessio Rastani thank you very much for talking with
us.
