On January 18, 2012, thousands of websites from around the world came out in
protest of two pieces of legislation that threaten to censor the internet as
we know it.

NaturalNews,
...and thousands of other websites censored
portions or all of their homepages and content in protest of the Stop
Online Piracy Act - SOPA (HR 3261), and the Protect IP Act - PIPA
(S 968), which would essentially give large media conglomerates and the
federal government unbridled power to censor the internet.
The website SopaStrike.com says the protest is the "largest online protest
in history," and its creators are urging everyone who encounters a censored
page to contact their Congressmen and oppose both SOPA and PIPA.
The page also contains a full list of confirmed
participants in the blackout, as well as an "unfiltered list" of all
additional sites that said they planned to participate:

Wired.com, for instance, participated in the protest by censoring most of
the headlines from its landing page with black boxes, while Google did the
same thing over its own logo - both of the websites were still functional,
however.
The Daily Paul went even further by literally
censoring all the content on its page, and redirecting all links to the
SopaStrike.com page where defenders of freedom are encouraged to take
action.
Over at reddit, which normally contains all sorts of user-submitted content,
visitors were greeted with a "REDDIT IS DOWN," message, as well as live
updates about the status of both SOPA and PIPA.
WordPress also took aggressive action against
the two censorship bills by blocking all user content from its homepage.
Why SOPA and PIPA
threaten legitimate web content with censorship
Last summer,
NaturalNews warned that the Preventing
Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of
Intellectual Property bill was basically a Trojan Horse that would allow
the US government to bypass normal legal procedures in targeting websites
that may contain, or link to, pirated content.
And its sister bill in the House of
Representatives, the now infamous SOPA bill,
threatens to do the very same thing.
Both bills have been crafted under the guise of protecting intellectual
property rights against piracy, particularly overseas piracy by foreign
websites, which is a valid purpose.
But as we have said numerous times before, the
broad scope of the language in the bills threatens many legitimate websites
with arbitrary takeover or shutdown by the US Justice Department, with
powerful groups like the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA),
the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and others
prompting and guiding this enforcement action behind the scenes.
Protest leads to
temporary 'shelving' of SOPA, PIPA still to be voted on January 24
The outcry against SOPA and PIPA has been so loud and effective that,
according to House majority leader Eric Cantor, SOPA will now be shelved,
and no vote will take place "unless there is consensus on the bill."
This decision represents a huge victory in the
short term - but a potential vote on the bill could still rear its ugly head
at any time, and most likely at a time
when nobody is looking.
PIPA is also still a threat as it is reportedly set to be vote on January
24.
This is why it is important to continue
bombarding Congress NOW with opposition to both bills.
