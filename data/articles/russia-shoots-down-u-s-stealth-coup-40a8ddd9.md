# Russia Shoots Down U.S. Stealth Coup

"Even if you look at the
ongoing processes through the microscope, you cannot see
any foreign political or domestic political components
in the demonstrations. People do not want electricity to
grow in price. That's all," said Pashinyan.
He said electric power is first of all a product: the
Electric Networks sells it and the citizens buy it.
"The protest actions should
be considered as protection of consumers' rights.
Politics is nowhere near," he said.
But politics were very near,
including politicians like Pashinyan himself, who made it a
point to visit jailed protesters throughout the failed uprising
and even at one point called for the construction of a "human
wall" of prominent Armenian personalities between protesters and
police.
US State Department-funded 'Armenia
Now' (of
the New Times Journalist Training Center) reported in
their article, "Politics
in the Middle - Lawmakers, public figures form "human wall"
between police, protesters," that:
The appeal to create a human wall was made by opposition
lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan late on Tuesday as he urged all
former and current MPs, scholars, show-biz representatives,
lawyers, reporters, religious representatives and other
public figures to visit the standoff site in order to ensure
no force is applied against the protesters.
Other obvious ties between the
protests,
Nikol
Pashinyan, and US-backed NGOs
have been laid out by geopolitical analyst Andrew Korybko
in his article, "'Electric
Yerevan' is Sliding Out of Control."
Despite these links, some have
attempted to claim Pashinyan was merely an opportunist and that
his US-backing, and attempts by US NGOs to manipulate the
protests had little to do with the protests themselves.
But nothing could be further from
the truth.
Stealth
Agitators
America's next generation of "color
revolutions" attempt to obfuscate all possible ties between
themselves and their agitators in an attempt to take back the
strategic initiative by maintaining maximum plausible
deniability.
But if one knows where to look, they
will find that no amount of obfuscation and subterfuge can cover
the links between the US State Department and its mobs.
The protests were the work of the
"No To Plunder" group, led by lawyers and activists emanating
from the,
...who openly coordinated efforts
with "No To Plunder" to pressure the government on a number of
issues.
At least 2 members of AYLA, Ara
Gharagyozyan and Arthur Kocharyan, were identified as
core members of "No To Plunder."
AYLA's news website "Iravaban"
would list a number of young lawyers and activists attending
one of its internship programs in 2014. Iravaban
would also cover the protests in intricate detail from start to
end, as well as report on activities AYLA and the Helsinki
Citizens' Assembly Vanadzor Office undertook to support the
protests.
A number of other pro-protest "news
sites" included Hetq,
which while it admits it is funded by convicted financial
criminal George Soros' Open Society Foundation, does not list
the US NED as a sponsor -
NED however does list Hetq.
There is also Media.am,
funded by USAID as well as the European Endowment for
Democracy. All of this adds up to a large network of
locally-based but foreign funded and directed media outlets that
help add the illusion of consensus to disinformation spread
regarding the protests.
Together with US-funded training
programs indoctrinating students and training lawyers and
activists in the finer arts of sedition, then allowing them to
go off on their own to lead mobs, the US believes sufficient
plausible deniability has been created to hide ties between
themselves and protest leaders.
Similar efforts have been made in
both Hong Kong and more recently in Thailand, where overtly
US-backed mobs have been replaced by students trained, then
unleashed by US-proxies.
Despite this careful arrangement,
the "Electric Yerevan" protests never reached critical mass.
The reason for this is simple - they
were suspected of being US-backed and the more overt US assets
that would eventually need to move in to lead the protests were
unable to, lest they confirmed that suspicion and undermined the
entire effort.
Without these more mainstream assets
moving in and providing support, larger protests are
logistically and politically impossible.
How to Shoot
Down a Stealth Coup
Russia's emerging media influence on
the world stage played an essential role in unmasking and
disrupting America's efforts to destabilize and overthrow the
government in Armenia.
The ability to be one step ahead of
the Western-narrative and expose the players before
they even take to the stage, meant that people already knew
what to look for.
When the protesters hit the streets,
and as the protests dragged on, US NGOs and Western media
reports supporting the protests confirmed initial Russian
warnings. When clumsy, overt assets like Pashinyan began getting
involved, there was little doubt that electrical prices, while a
real point of contention, were being used as a means to create a
larger, more disruptive, and ultimately dangerous attempt at
foreign-backed regime change.
In the future, the government of
Armenia should be careful about giving such points of contention
for foreign interests to use in the first place - meaning that
dedication to economic and social progress cannot be ignored,
even if one is confident they can tamp down potential protests.
Other nations around the world have
a lot to learn from how Russia disrupted this latest attempt by
America to project power beyond its shores and disrupt the lives
of a sovereign people thousands of miles away.
By simply,
...people in Armenia were able to
assess for themselves whether or not to support the
mobs - they chose wisely not to.
Were Armenia to adopt similar laws
as Russia's regarding NGOs - mandating that they declare openly
and often their foreign funding - people can better assess
whether or not mobs these NGOs are supporting are truly marching
for their interests, or Wall Street and Washington's.
