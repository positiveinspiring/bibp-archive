The United Nation's Human Rights
Council in Geneva reviews the human rights record
of the United States on the 5th
of November 2010,
on the occasion of the Ninth Session
of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), 1 to 12 November 2010.
The following is a presentation
given by Dirk Adriaensens in Geneva on 3 November.
Just days after the devastating attacks of 9/11 Deputy Defense secretary
Paul Wolfowitz declared that a major focus of US foreign policy would be:
ending states that sponsor terrorism.
Iraq was labeled a terrorist state and targeted for ending.
President Bush went on to declare Iraq the major front of the global war on
terror. US forces invaded illegally with the express aim to dismantling the
Iraqi state. After WWII focus of social sciences was on state-building and
development model. Little has been written on state-destruction and
de-development. We can now, after 7 years of war and occupation, state for
certain that state-ending was a deliberate policy objective.
The consequences in human and cultural terms of the destruction of the Iraqi
state have been enormous:
-
notably the death of over 1,3 million civilians
-
the degradation in social infrastructure, including electricity, potable
water and sewage systems
-
over eight million Iraqis are in need of
humanitarian assistance
-
abject poverty: the UN Human rights report for the
1st quarter of 2007 found that 54% of Iraqis were living on less than $1 a
day
-
the displacement of minimum 2.5 million refugees and 2.764.000
internally displaced people as to end 2009
-
one in six Iraqis is displaced
-
ethnic & religious minorities are on the
verge of extinction
UN-HABITAT, an
agency of the United Nations, published a 218-page report entitled State of
the Worlds Cities, 2010-2011. Prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003,
the percentage of the urban population living in slums in Iraq hovered just
below 20 percent.
Today, that percentage has risen to 53 percent:
11 million
of the 19 million total urban dwellers.
Destroying Iraqi
education
The UNESCO report Education Under Attack 2010 - Iraq, dated 10 February
2010, concludes that,
Although overall security in Iraq had improved, the
situation faced by schools, students, teachers and academics remained
dangerous.
The director of the United Nations University International
Leadership Institute published a report on 27 April 2005 detailing that
since the start of the war of 2003 some 84% of Iraq's higher education
institutions have been burnt, looted or destroyed.
Ongoing violence has
destroyed school buildings and around a quarter of all Iraqs primary
schools need major rehabilitation. Since March 2003, more than 700 primary
schools have been bombed, 200 have been burnt and over 3,000 looted.
Populations of teachers in Baghdad have fallen by 80%. Between March 2003
and October 2008, 31,598 violent attacks against educational institutions
were reported in Iraq, according to the Ministry of Education (MoE).
Since
2007 bombings at Al Mustansiriya University in Baghdad have killed or maimed
more than 335 students and staff members, according to a 19 Oct 2009 NYT
article, and a 12-foot-high blast wall has been built around the campus. MNF-I,
the Iraqi Army and Iraqi police units occupied more than 70 school buildings
for military purposes in the Diyala governorate alone, in clear violation of
The Hague Conventions.
The UNESCO report is very clear:
Attacks on
education targets continued throughout 2007 and 2008 at a lower rate - but
one that would cause serious concern in any other country.
Why didnt it
cause serious concern when it comes to Iraq?
And the attacks are on the rise
again, an increase of 50%, as these statistics show:
(On the 20th of March 2008, Reporters Without Borders reported
that hundreds of journalists were forced into exile since the start of
US-led invasion.)
Eliminating the Iraqi
middle class
Running parallel with the destruction of Iraqs educational infrastructure,
this repression led to the mass forced displacement of the bulk of Iraqs
educated middle class - the main engine of progress and development in
modern states.
Iraqs intellectual and technical class has been subject to a
systematic and ongoing campaign of intimidation, abduction, extortion,
random killings and targeted assassinations.
The decimation of professional
ranks took place in the context of a generalized assault on Iraqs
professional middle class, including doctors, engineers, lawyers, judges as
well as political and religious leaders. Roughly 40 percent of Iraq's middle
class is believed to have fled by the end of 2006. Few have returned.
Up to
75 percent of Iraq's doctors, pharmacists and nurses have left their jobs
since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.
More than half of those have emigrated.
Twenty thousand of Iraqs 34,000 registered physicians left Iraq after the
U.S. invasion. As of April 2009, fewer than 2,000 returned, the same as the
number who were killed during the course of the war.
To this date, there has been no systematic investigation of this phenomenon
by the occupation authorities. Not a single arrest has been reported in
regard to this terrorization of the intellectuals.
The inclination to treat
this systematic assault on Iraqi professionals as somehow inconsequential is
consistent with the occupation powers more general role in the decapitation
of Iraqi society.
Destroying the Iraqi
culture and erasing collective memory
All these terrible losses are compounded by unprecedented levels of cultural
devastation, attacks on national archives and monuments that represent the
historical identity of the Iraqi people.
On Americas watch we now know that
thousands of cultural artifacts disappeared during Operation Iraqi
Freedom.
These objects included no less that 15.000 invaluable Mesopotamian
artifacts from the National Museum in Baghdad, and many others from the
12.000 archaeological sites that the occupation forces left unguarded.
While
the Museum was robbed of its historical collection, the National Library
that preserved the continuity and pride of Iraqi history was deliberately
destroyed. Occupation authorities took no effective measures to protect
important cultural sites, despite warnings of international specialists.
According to a recent update on the number of stolen
artifacts by Francis Deblauwe, an expert archaeologist on Iraq, it appears that no less than
8.500 objects are still truly missing, in addition to 4.000 artifacts said
to be recovered abroad but not yet returned to Iraq.
The smuggling and trade
of Iraqi antiquities has become one of the most profitable businesses in
contemporary Iraq.
The attitude of the US-led forces to this pillage has been, at best,
indifference and worse. The failure of the US to carry out its
responsibilities under international law to take positive and protective
actions was compounded by egregious direct actions taken that severely
damaged the Iraqi cultural heritage.
Since the invasion in March 2003, the
US-led forces have transformed at least seven historical sites into bases or
camps for the military, including
UR, one of the most ancient cities of the
world and birthplace of Abraham, including the mythical Babylon where a US
military camp has irreparably damaged the ancient city.
Destroying the Iraqi
state
Rampant chaos and violence hamper efforts at reconstruction, leaving the
foundations of the Iraqi state in ruins.
The majority of Western
journalists, academics and political figures have refused to recognize the
loss of life on such a massive scale and the cultural destruction that
accompanied it as the fully predictable consequences of American occupation
policy.
The very idea is considered unthinkable, despite the openness with
which this objective was pursued.
It is time to think the unthinkable. The American-led assault on Iraq forces
us to consider the meaning and consequences of state-destruction as a policy
objective. The architects of the Iraq policy never made explicit what
deconstructing and reconstructing the Iraqi state would entail; their
actions, however, make the meaning clear.
From those actions in Iraq, a
fairly precise definition of state-ending can be read. The campaign to
destroy the state of Iraq involved first the removal and execution of the
legal head of state
Saddam Hussein and the capture and expulsion of Baath
figures. However, state destruction went beyond regime change. It also
entailed the purposeful dismantling of major state institutions and the
launching of a prolonged process of political reshaping.
Bremer's 100 orders turned Iraq into a
giant free-market paradise, but a hellish nightmare for Iraqis.
They colonized the country for capital -
pillage on the grandest scale. New economic laws instituted low taxes, 100%
foreign investor ownership of Iraqi assets, the right to expropriate all
profits, unrestricted imports, and long-term 30-40 year deals and leases,
dispossessing Iraqis of their own resources.
This desecration of the past and undermining of contemporary social gains is
now giving way in occupied Iraq to the destruction of a meaningful future.
Iraq is being handed over to the disintegrative forces of sectarianism and
regionalism. Iraqis, stripped of their shared heritage and living today in
the ruins of contemporary social institutions that sustained a coherent and
unified society, are now bombarded by the forces of civil war, social and
religious atavism and widespread criminality.
Iraqi nationalism that had
emerged through a prolonged process of state-building and social interaction
is now routinely disparaged.
The regime installed by occupation forces in
Iraq reshaped the country along divisive sectarian lines, dissolving the
hard-won unity of a long state-building project. Dominant narratives now
falsely claim that sectarianism and ethnic chauvinism have always been the
basis of Iraqi society, recycling yet again the persistent and destructive
myth of age-old conflicts with no resolution and for which the conquerors
bear no responsibility.
Contemporary Iraq represents a fragmented pastiche
of sectarian forces with the formal trappings of liberal democracy and
neo-liberal economic structures. We call this the divide and rule technique,
used to fracture and subdue culturally cohesive regions.
This reshaping of
the Iraqi state resulted in a policy of ethnic cleansing, partially revealed
by
the Wikileaks files.
The Wikileaks
documents
The Wikileaks documents, first made public on 22 October 2010, show how the
US military gave a secret order not to investigate torture by Iraqi
authorities discovered by American troops.
The data also reveal how hundreds of civilians were killed by coalition
forces in unreported events, how hundreds of Iraqi civilians: pregnant
women, elderly people and children, were shot at checkpoints.
There are numerous claims of prison abuse by coalition forces even after the
Abu Ghraib scandal. The files also paint a grim picture of widespread
torture in Iraqi detention facilities.
Two revelations await the reader of
the Wikileaks section dealing with civilian deaths in the Iraq War:
The documents record a descent into chaos and horror as the country plunged
into so-called civil war. The logs also record thousands of bodies, many
brutally tortured, dumped on the streets of Iraq.
Through the Wikileaks files we can see the impact the war had on Iraqi men,
women and children. The sheer scale of the deaths, detentions and violence
is here officially acknowledged for the first time.
A thorough research of these documents will give us a further insight into
the atrocities committed in Iraq. The Wikileaks logs can serve as evidence
in courts. They are important material for lawyers to file charges against
the US for negligence and responsibility for the killing of thousands.
A
fair compensation for the families of the victims and the recognition of
their suffering can help to heal the wounds. In the first official US State
Department response to the massive WikiLeaks release of these classified
Iraq War documents, spokesman P.J. Crowley shrugged off the evidence that US
troops were ordered to cover up detainee abuse by the Iraqi government,
insisting the abuse wasnt Americas problem. This response is infuriating.
The perpetrators of this violence and those who ordered the soldiers to turn
a blind eye when being confronted with torture and extra-judicial killings
should be convicted for war crimes. The US and UK forces and Governments
clearly refused to fulfil their obligations under international law as a de
facto occupying power.
However, these logs reveal only the 'SIGACT's or Significant Actions in the
war as told by soldiers in the United States Army: the reports of the
regular US troops.
The logs contain nothing new, they merely confirm and officialize what the Iraqis and un-embedded Western observers have been
trying to convey to the public for years. While all of the press is now
reporting the Wikileaks story, few media outlets are going back to their own
coverage and acknowledging how they have failed to honestly report about the
crimes.
What these 400.000 documents do not reveal is the US involvement of
irregular troops in Special Operations, counter-insurgency war and death
squads activities.
When will the documents of the dirty war be revealed?
The
BRussells Tribunal, monitoring this horrendous invasion and occupation
since 2003, is convinced that the leaked logs only scratch the surface of
the catastrophic war in Iraq. What we can extract from the Wikileaks
documents is only the tip of the iceberg.
It is time to take a dive into the
troubled waters of the Iraq war and try to explore the hidden part of the
iceberg.
Ethnic cleansing
It became clear after the invasion in 2003 that the Iraqi exile groups were
to play an important role in the violent response to dissent in occupied
Iraq.
Already on January 1st 2004, it was reported that the US government
planned to create paramilitary units comprised of militiamen from Iraqi
Kurdish and exile groups including the Badr brigades, the Iraqi National
Congress and the Iraqi National Accord to wage a campaign of terror and
extra-judicial killing, similar to the Phoenix program in Vietnam: the
terror and assassination campaign that killed tens of thousands of
civilians.
The $87 billion supplemental appropriation for the war in November 2003
included $3 billion for a classified program, funds that would be used for
the paramilitaries for the next 3 years.
Over that period, the news from
Iraq gradually came to be dominated by reports of death squads and ethnic
cleansing, described in the press as sectarian violence that was used as
the new central narrative of the war and the principal justification for
continued occupation. Some of the violence may have been spontaneous, but
there is overwhelming evidence that most of it was the result of the plans
described by several American experts in December 2003.
Despite subsequent American efforts to distance US policy from the horrific
results of this campaign, it was launched with the full support of
conservative opinion-makers in the USA, even declaring that,
The Kurds and
the INC have excellent intelligence operations that we should allow them to
exploit
especially to conduct counterinsurgency in the Sunny Triangle as a
Wall Street Journal editorial stated.
The Salvador Option
In January 2005, more than a year after the first reports about the
Pentagons planning for assassinations and paramilitary operations emerged,
the Salvador Option hit the pages of Newsweek and other major
news-outlets.
The outsourcing of state terrorism to local proxy forces was
regarded as a key component of a policy that had succeeded in preventing the
total defeat of the US-backed government in El Salvador. Pentagon-hired
mercenaries, like
Dyncorp, helped form the sectarian militias that were used
to terrorize and kill Iraqis and to provoke Iraq into civil war.
In 2004 two senior US Army officers published a favorable review of the
American proxy war in Colombia:
Presidents Reagan and Bush supported a
small, limited war while trying to keep US military involvement a secret
from the American public and media. Present US policy toward Colombia
appears to follow this same disguised, quiet, media-free approach.
It reveals the fundamental nature of dirty war, like in Latin America and
the worst excesses of the Vietnam War.
The purpose of dirty war is not to
identify and then detain or kill actual resistance fighters. The target of
dirty war is the civilian population. It is a strategy of state terrorism
and collective punishment against an entire population with the objective to
terrorizing it into submission. The same tactics used in Central America and
Colombia were exported to Iraq.
Even the architects of these dirty wars in
El Salvador (Ambassador John Negroponte and James Steele) and in Colombia
(Steven Casteel) were transferred to Iraq to do the same dirty work.
They
recruited, trained and deployed the notorious Special Police Commandos, in
which later, in 2006, death squads like the Badr Brigades and other militias
were incorporated. US forces set up a high-tech operations centre for the
Special Police Commandos at an undisclosed location in Iraq.
American
technicians installed satellite telephones and computers with uplinks to the
Internet and US forces Networks. The command centre had direct connections
to the Iraqi Interior Ministry and to every US forward operating base in the
country.
As news of atrocities by these forces in Iraq hit the newsstands in 2005,
Casteel would play a critical role in blaming extrajudicial killings on
insurgents with stolen police uniforms, vehicles and weapons. He also
claimed that torture centers were run by rogue elements of the Interior
Ministry, even as accounts came to light of torture taking place inside the
ministry headquarters where he and other Americans worked.
US advisers to
the Interior Ministry had their offices on the 8th floor, directly above a
jail on the 7th floor where torture was taking place.
The uncritical attitude of the Western media to American officials like
Steven Casteel prevented a worldwide popular and diplomatic outcry over the
massive escalation of the dirty war in Iraq in 2005 and 2006, consistent
with the disguised, quiet, media-free approach mentioned before.
As the
Newsweek story broke in January 2005, General Downing, the former head of US
Special Forces, appeared on NBC.
He said:
This is under control of the US
forces, of the current Interim Iraqi government. Theres no need to think
that were going to have any kind of killing campaign thats going to maim
innocent civilians.
Within months, Iraq was swept by exactly that kind of a
killing campaign.
This campaign has led to arbitrary detention, torture,
extra-judicial executions and the mass exodus and internal displacement of
millions. Thousands of Iraqis disappeared during the worst days of this
dirty war between 2005 and 2007. Some were seen picked up by uniformed
militias and piled into lorries, others simply seemed to vanish.
Iraqs
minister of human rights Wijdan Mikhail said that her ministry had received
more than 9,000 complaints in 2005 and 2006 alone from Iraqis who said a
relative had disappeared. Human rights groups put the total number much
higher.
The fate of many missing Iraqis remains unknown. Many are
languishing in one of Iraq's notoriously secretive prisons.
Journalist Dr. Yasser Salihee was killed on June 24th 2005 by an American
sniper, so-called accidentally.
Three days after his death
Knight Ridder
published a report on his investigation into the Special Police Commandos
and their links to torture, extra-judicial killings and disappearances in
Baghdad. Salihee and his colleagues investigated at least 30 separate cases
of abductions leading to torture and death.
In every case witnesses gave
consistent accounts of raids by large numbers of police commandos in
uniform, in clearly marked police vehicles, with police weapons and
bullet-proof vests. And in every case the detained were later found dead,
with almost identical signs of torture and they were usually killed by a
single gunshot to the head.
The effect of simply not pointing out the connection between the US and the
Iranian-backed Badr Brigade militia, the US-backed Wolf Brigade and other
Special Police Commando units, or the extent of American recruitment,
training, command, and control of these units, was far-reaching. It
distorted perceptions of events in Iraq throughout the ensuing escalation of
the war, creating the impression of senseless violence initiated by the
Iraqis themselves and concealing the American hand in the planning and
execution of the most savage forms of violence.
By providing cover for the
crimes committed by the US government, news editors played a significant
role in avoiding the public outrage that might have discouraged the further
escalation of this campaign.
The precise extent of US complicity in different aspects and phases of death
squad operations, torture and disappearances, deserves thorough
investigation. It is not credible that American officials were simply
innocent bystanders to thousands of these incidents.
As frequently pointed
out by Iraqi observers, Interior Ministry death squads moved unhindered
through American as well as Iraqi checkpoints as they detained, tortured and
killed thousands of people.
As in other countries where US forces have engaged in what they refer to as
counter-insurgency, American military and intelligence officials
recruited, trained, equipped and directed local forces which engaged in a
campaign of state-sponsored terror against the overwhelming proportion of
the local population who continued to reject and oppose the invasion and
occupation of their country.
The degree of US initiative in the recruitment, training, equipping,
deployment, command and control of the Special Police Commandos made it
clear that American trainers and commanders established the parameters
within which these forces operated. Many Iraqis and Iranians were certainly
guilty of terrible crimes in the conduct of this campaign.
But the prime
responsibility for this policy, and for the crimes it involved, rests with
the individuals in the civilian and military command structure of the US
Department of Defense, the CIA and the White House who devised, approved and
implemented the Phoenix or Salvador terror policy in Iraq.
The report of the Human Rights Office of UNAMI, issued on September 8th
2005, written by John Pace was very explicit, linking the campaign of
detentions, torture and extra-judicial executions directly to the Interior
Ministry and indirectly to the US-led Multi-National Forces.
The final UN Human Rights Report of 2006 described the consequences of these
policies for the people of Baghdad, while downplaying their institutional
roots in American policy. The sectarian violence that engulfed Iraq in
2006 was not an unintended consequence of the US invasion and occupation but
an integral part of it.
The United States did not just fail to restore
stability and security to Iraq. It deliberately undermined them in a
desperate effort to divide and rule the country and to fabricate new
justifications for unlimited violence against Iraqis who continued to reject
the illegal invasion and occupation of their country.
The nature and extent of involvement of different individuals and groups
within the US occupation structure has remained a dirty, dark secret, but
there are many leads that could be followed by any serious inquiry.
The Surge
In January 2007, the US government announced a new strategy, the surge of
US combat troops in Baghdad and Al-Anbar province.
Most Iraqis reported that
this escalation of violence made living conditions even worse than before,
as its effects were added to the accumulated devastation of 4 years of war
and occupation. The UN Human Rights report for the 1st quarter of 2007 gave
a description of the dire conditions of the Iraqi people. The violence of
the surge resulted i.e. in a further 22% reduction of the number of
doctors, leaving only 15.500 out of an original 34.000 by September 2008.
The number of refugees and internally displaced has risen sharply during the
period 2007-2008.
Since Interior Ministry forces under US command were responsible for a large
part of the extra-judicial killings, the occupation authorities had the
power to reduce or increase the scale of these atrocities more or less on
command.
So a reduction in the killings with the launch of the security
plan should not have been difficult to achieve.
In fact, a small reduction
in violence seems to have served an important propaganda role for a period
until the death squads got back to work, supported by the new American
offensive.
The escalation of American firepower in 2007, including a five-fold increase
in air strikes and the use of Spectre gun-ships and artillery in addition to
the surge was intended as a devastating climax to the past 4 years of war
and collective punishment inflicted upon the Iraqi people. All
resistance-held areas would be targeted with overwhelming fire-power, mainly
from the air, until the US ground forces could build walls around what
remained of each neighborhood and isolate each district.
Its worth
mentioning that General Petraeus compared the hostilities in Ramadi with the
Battle of Stalingrad without qualms about adopting the role of the German
invaders in this analogy. Ramadi was completely destroyed as was Fallujah in
November 2004.
The UN Human Rights reports of 2007 mentioned the indiscriminate and illegal
attacks against civilians and civilian areas and asked for investigations.
Air strikes continued on an almost daily basis until August 2008 even as the
so-called sectarian violence and US casualties declined. In all the
reported incidents where civilians, women and children were killed, Centcom
press office declared that the people killed were terrorists, Al Qaeda
militants or involuntary human shields.
Of course, when military forces
are illegally ordered to attack civilian areas, many people will try to
defend themselves, especially if they know that the failure to do so may
result in arbitrary detention, abuse, torture, or summary execution for
themselves or their relatives.
Forces involved in
Special Operations
Another aspect of the surge or escalation appears to have been an increase
in the use of the American Special Forces assassination teams.
In April 2008 i.e. President
Bush declared:
As we speak, US Special Forces are launching
multiple operations every night to capture or kill Al-Qaeda leaders in
Iraq.
The NYT reported on 13 May 2009:
When General Stanley McChrystal
took over the Joint Special Operations Command in 2003, he inherited an
insular, shadowy commando force with a reputation for spurning partnerships
with other military and intelligence organizations.
But over the next five
years he worked hard, his colleagues say, to build close relationships with
the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. (
) In Iraq, where he oversaw secret commando
operations for five years, former intelligence officials say that he had an
encyclopaedic, even obsessive, knowledge about the lives of terrorists, and
that he pushed his ranks aggressively to kill as many of them as possible.
(
)
Most of what General McChrystal has done over a 33-year career remains
classified, including service between 2003 and 2008 as commander of the
Joint Special Operations Command, an elite unit so clandestine that the
Pentagon for years refused to acknowledge its existence.
The secrecy
surrounding these operations prevented more widespread reporting, but as
with earlier US covert operations in Vietnam and Latin America, we will
learn more about these operations over time.
-
an article in the Sunday Telegraph in February 2007 pointed towards clear
evidence British Special Forces recruited and trained terrorists in the
Green Zone to heighten ethnic tensions.
An elite SAS wing, called Task
Force Black, with bloody past in Northern Ireland operates with immunity
and provides advanced explosives. Some attacks are being blamed on Iranians,
Sunni insurgents or shadowy terrorist cells such as Al Qaeda.
-
the SWAT teams (Special Weapons and Tactics), extensively used in
counter-insurgency operations.
The mission of SWAT is to conduct high-risk
operations that fall outside the abilities of regular patrol officers to
prevent, deter and respond to terrorism and insurgent activities. It was
reported that,
On 7 October 2010 the Official website of US Forces in Iraq
reported that,
-
The Basrah SWAT team has trained with various Special Forces
units, including the Navy SEALs and the British SAS. The 1st Bn., 68th Arm.
Regt., currently under the operational control of United States
Division-South and the 1st Infantry Division, has taken up the task of
teaching the SWAT team.
-
the Facilities Protection Services, where the private contractors or
mercenaries, like Blackwater, are incorporated, are also used in
counter-insurgency operations.
-
the Iraq Special Operations Forces (ISOF), probably the largest special
forces outfit ever built by the United States, free of many of the controls
that most governments employ to rein in such lethal forces.
The project
started in Jordan just after the Americans conquered Baghdad in April 2003,
to create a deadly, elite, covert unit, fully fitted with American
equipment, which would operate for years under US command and be
unaccountable to Iraqi ministries and the normal political process.
According to Congressional records, the ISOF has grown into nine battalions,
which extend to four regional "commando bases" across Iraq. By December 2009
they were fully operational, each with its own "intelligence infusion cell,"
which will operate independently of Iraq's other intelligence networks. The
ISOF is at least 4,564 operatives strong, making it approximately the size
of the US Army's own Special Forces in Iraq.
Congressional records indicate
that there are plans to double the ISOF over the next "several years."
Conclusion
The dirty war in Iraq continues.
Even as President
Barack
Obama was announcing the end of combat in Iraq, U.S. forces were still in
fight alongside their Iraqi colleagues. The tasks of the 50,000 remaining US
troops, 5,800 of them airmen, are advising" and training the Iraqi army,
"providing security" and carrying out "counter-terrorism" missions.
According to the UN Human Rights report, upon a request for clarification by
UNAMI, the MNF confirmed that,
the US government continued to regard the
conflict in Iraq as an international armed conflict, with procedures
currently in force consistent with the 4th Geneva Convention,
...and not that
the civil rights of Iraqis should be governed by the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights and other human rights laws, because this
would have strengthened the rights of Iraqis detained by US or Iraqi forces
to speedy and fair trials.
The admission that the US was still legally
engaged in an international armed conflict against Iraq at the end of 2007
also raises serious questions regarding the legality of constitutional and
political changes made in Iraq by the occupation forces and their installed
government during the war and occupation.
Legitimizing torture
When the public revelations of abuse and torture at Abu Ghraib prison
created a brief furor in the world, the ICRC, Human Rights First, AI, HRW
and other Human Rights groups documented far more widespread and systematic
crimes committed by US forces against people they extra-judicially detained
in Iraq.
In numerous human rights reports they established that command
responsibility for these crimes extended to the highest levels of the US
government and its armed forces.
The forms of torture documented in these reports included,
-
death threats
-
mock executions
-
water-boarding
-
stress positions, including excruciating
and sometimes deadly forms of hanging
-
hypothermia
-
sleep deprivation
-
starvation and thirst
-
withholding medical treatment
-
electric shocks
-
various forms of rape and sodomy
-
endless beatings, burning, cutting with
knives
-
injurious use of flexicuffs
-
suffocation
-
sensory assault and/or
deprivation,
...and more psychological forms of torture such as sexual
humiliation and the detention and torture of family members.
The ICRC
established that the violations of international humanitarian law that it
recorded were systematic and widespread.
Military officers told the ICRC
that,
between 70% and 90% of the persons deprived of their liberty in Iraq
had been arrested by mistake.
All these facts are well known, but only the lower ranks in the Army were
mildly punished.
The Commands Responsibility report revealed that the
failure to charge higher ranking officers was the direct result of the key
role that some same officers played in undermining chances for full
accountability. By delaying and undermining investigations of deaths in
their custody, senior officers compounded their own criminal responsibility
in a common pattern of torture, murder and obstruction of justice.
Senior
officers abused the enormous power they wield in the military command
structure to place themselves beyond the reach of law, even as they gave
orders to commit terrible crimes. It was in recognition of the terrible
potential for exactly this type of criminal behavior that the Geneva
Conventions were drafted and signed in the first place, and that is why they
are just as vital today.
Nevertheless, the responsibility for these crimes is not limited to the US
army. The public record also includes documents in which senior civilian
officials of the US government approved violations of the Geneva
Conventions, the 1994 Convention against Torture and the 1996 US War Crimes
act.
The United States government should thus be held accountable for this
terrible tragedy it inflicted upon millions of Iraqi citizens and should be
forced to pay appropriate compensations to the victims of its criminal
policy in Iraq.
RECOMMENDATIONS
We learned that on Tuesday the 26th of October the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay urged Iraq and the United States
to investigate allegations of torture and unlawful killings in the Iraq
conflict revealed in the Wikileaks documents.
We are very surprised by this
statement.
Does the High Commissioner think it is appropriate for criminals
to investigate their own crimes? Wijdan Mikhail, the Iraqi Minister of
Human
Rights in Iraq has called for putting
Julian Assange on trial instead of
investigating the crimes.
And since the Obama administration has shown no
desire to expose any of the crimes committed by US officials in Iraq, an
international investigation under the auspices of the High Commissioner of
Human Rights is necessary.
Different Special Rapporteurs should be involved:
i.e.
-
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary
executions
-
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human
rights while countering terrorism
-
the Special Rapporteur on torture and
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
A Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq should be urgently
appointed.
Although
the United Nations did not authorize the invasion of Iraq, it did legalize
the occupation a posteriori in
UNSC resolution 1483 (22 May 2003), against
the will of the overwhelming majority of the world community, that didnt
accept the legality or the legitimacy of that UN resolution. And it was
during the occupation that the war crimes brought to light by WikiLeaks took
place.
As should the U.S., the U.N. has the moral and legal duty to respond.
The world community has the right to know the complete and unbiased truth
about the extent and responsibilities of American involvement in Iraqs
Killing Fields and demands justice for the Iraqi people.
We appeal to all states to ask the US about all these crimes against the
Iraqi people during the UPR on the 5th of November.
We also demand that procedures be set up to compensate the Iraqi people and
Iraq as a nation for all the losses, human and material destruction and
damages caused by the illegal war and the occupation of the country lead by
the US/UK forces.
