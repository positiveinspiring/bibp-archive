# Obama's Bizarre Threats Indicate U.S. Desperation in Syria

US-led NATO forces armed,
funded, trained, and even provided air support for
Libyan terrorists emanating out of Libya's eastern
Cyrenaica region - most notably Benghazi which had
served as the premier international terrorist recruiting
ground in the world,
according to the US Army's Combating Terrorism Center,
producing a percentage per capita of militants
outstripping even that of Saudi Arabia.
Operating under the banner of the "Libyan Islamic
Fighting Group" (LIFG), a,
...listed international terrorist
organization, and officially merged with Al Qaeda in
2007, its commanders including
Abdul Hakim Belhaj and
Mahdi al-Harati led NATO's military proxy forces on
the ground as US, French, and British planes destroyed
the nation from the air.
These very same commanders of this very same
listed-terrorist organization would then turn its cash,
weapons, and fighters on Syria,
as early as November 2011, arriving on the
Turkish-Syrian border to enjoy yet another NATO safe
haven and logistical networks
overseen by Western intelligence along with US
funding and arms laundered through Gulf Cooperative
Council (GCC) members such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

United Nations, and the

- listed
terrorist organization, the Libyan
Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG),
addressing fellow terrorists in
Syria. Harati is now commanding a
Libyan brigade operating inside of
Syria attempting to destroy the
Syrian government and subjugate the
Syrian population. Traditionally,
this is known as "foreign
invasion."
In essence, just as Al Qaeda
had served as an "Arab Foreign Legion" for the US in
Afghanistan in the 1980's during its inception, it once
again is serving as a foreign legion inside Syria,
fighting Washington's proxy war against the Syrian
government.
It appears however that unlike in Afghanistan where Al
Qaeda fought alongside a sizable indigenous force
against foreign Soviet troops, the tactical environment
is reversed - where Washington's proxy terrorist forces
are foreigners facing a highly motivated, well
organized, and better armed indigenous Syrian Army.
US
Machinations Unraveling - Shareholders Face
Liquidation
Coordinated attempts by NATO and its proxy forces to
invade and overrun the cities of Damascus and Aleppo in
July and early August have failed, with proxy forces
being expelled after suffering sizable loses.
An attempt
to decapitate Syria's leadership in a bombing in central
Damascus also fell flat, with high ranking officials
quickly replaced, followed quickly by a cohesive
military counter offensive.
The bombing was also followed by
the mysterious disappearance of Saudi Arabia's Bandar
"Bush" Bin Sultan, who if confirmed assassinated,
may indicate that NATO's plans are suffering at even the
highest levels of organization.
Compounding the West's attempts to overthrow the
government of Syria, is the increasing support Syria has
been receiving due to Iranian efforts
to assemble international forums representing half
of the world's population, condemning the support of
foreign interference and promoting alternatives to the
violent destabilization being carried out by the West.
A
30 member conference was held ahead of the annual
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) meeting in Tehran, Iran - and
another meeting will be held again on the sidelines of
NAM toward the end of August.
An impressive counter to the
so-called "Friends of Syria" confabs
held by Wall Street and London
corporate-financier interests in an
attempt to sway global opinion
toward a repeat of Libya's
destruction at NATO's hands,
the International Consultative
Conference hosed by Iran seeks
to end the flow of foreign arms into
militant hands and resolve political
differences through more civilized
means.
With the tactical situation
inside Syria deteriorating for Western proxies and
international consensus shifting in unprecedented
directions against Washington and London, shareholders
in the West's latest adventure appear to be making tacit
moves to divest their support and protect their own
interests, lest they be left with the ignominious
results of an increasingly compounding failure.
Obama's Recent Threats
With this in mind, the US has been making increasingly
unhinged "Bush-esque" remarks regarding "weapons of mass
destruction" in Syria and attempting to expand the
pretexts under which it could "militarily intervene."
Even the very "movement" of
Syria's "unconventional weapons" in a "threatening
manner," US President Barack Obama
claimed in a recent statement, would constitute a
"red line."
Obama claims that the US "fears" Syria's unconventional
weapons,
"falling into the hands of the wrong people."
If the US is willfully
arming, funding, and threatening to back militarily,
listed Al Qaeda terrorist organizations, then whose
hands is the US referring to?
And while the US struggles
to foment victory in Syria, it seems to have stretched
its support for terrorism all the way to Russia's
Caucasus Mountains, reigniting violence there, linked to
Al Qaeda as well.
The Washington Consensus' shrinking
legitimacy is proportionally matched
to its increasingly untenable
perpetuation. Its unjustified,
disastrous military adventure in
Libya seems to have resulted in a
Pyrrhic victory, hobbling the
institutions and legitimacy it
needed to likewise undermine and
overthrow the Syrian government in a
timely fashion. Overstretched, it
appears the West is even trying to
strike at Russia with terrorist
proxies that now span from North
Africa all the way to the Caucasus
Mountains.
To say that the US is
overstretched is an understatement.
It is overstretched
politically, economically, and tactically. It risks a
historically unprecedented collapse that would destroy
all shareholders invested in its increasingly unhinged
and transparently illegitimate ambitions. Nations, in
particular GCC members, are beginning to realize with
acute alarm that their support of Washington's agenda is
now threatening their very self-preservation.
A victory
even at this point would still likely be Pyrrhic.
No matter how well Syria goes for the West from this
point on, the mechanisms it has used to get here,
including its "Responsibility to Protect" doctrine, the
legitimacy of the UN, the West's so-called commitment to
"human rights," and the narrative of the
so-called "War
on Terror" have been undermined beyond salvage.
One can only imagine the mountains Washington is
promising to move in order to keep its allies lined up
behind them, particularly the ruling governments of
Turkey and the GCC. For an elitist clique that has
prided itself in "realist" political discourse, it has
become increasingly surrealist.
Whether or not Washington's
allies mirror this surrealism all the way to their own
demise, remains to be seen.
