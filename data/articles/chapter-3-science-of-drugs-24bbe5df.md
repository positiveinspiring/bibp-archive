CHAPTER 3.
SCIENCE NO. 3
THE USE OF DRUGS
The science of
Pharmacology (drugs) has given the Programmers a vast array of
mind-altering and body-altering drugs. Some of the drugs are not used to
directly alter the mind, but to change the body (makethe skin burn), or
make the person vomit, or some other reaction that can be harnessed to
further their nefarious programming goals. If they want a little girl to
develop breasts they might give her hormones. Neuroscientists are now
familiar with chemicals which cause personality traits.
If one wants to
create raving paranoia, simply provide the brain with too much dopamine
in the emotional centers of the brain and too little dopamine in the
seat of reasoning area of the brain. Reduce serotonin in the person and
the person will be unable to connect disagreeable consequences with what
provoked them. In other words, they cant protect themselves from
danger.
Thorazine was used regularly at the
CIAs Jonestown, Guyana
group control experiment. Survivors of Jonestown have testified as to
its effectiveness. After this gruesome experiment in mind control came
to its end with a massacre, large amounts of drugs were discovered. Just
one footlocker at Jonestown alone contained 11,000 doses. The
authorities prevented chemical autopsies of the bodies to insure secrecy
of this sophisticated concentration camp which was used for medical and
psychiatric experimentation by the CIA.
An examination of the drugs that
are used in mental hospitals to alter the minds of patients offers a
clear indication of what is being used in the Monarch Mind Control
programming.
DRUGS USED
FOR MIND CONTROL
The CIA/Illuminati programming centers have more than
600-700 different drugs at their disposal.
The following is a partial
list of the drugs available for their mind-control (aka MK-Ultra
Programming). They can make a person feel like he is in heaven, or
burning in hell. The drugs are at times used with elaborate light, sound
and motion shows that produce whatever effect the programmer wants to
produce.
They can make a person believe he is shrinking, or that he is
double (with mirrors), or that he is dying. Before describing how drugs
are used for programming & control, let us list a few which we know have
been used. This list comes from CIA documents obtained from the Freedom
of Information Act and from what Multiples used as Programmers remember.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE USE
Religious groups, shamans, medicine men, witches and
cults have been using mind altering drugs throughout history. The
medieval witches used potions of hemlock and aconite for their flying
ointments. These are herbs (natural drugs) which will create delirium.
Contemporary witnesses reported that covens during the medieval ages
would apply the potion of hemlock and aconite to cause their new witch
to go delirious, and then would transport the person to the Sabbat,
where they would be told they flew there.
The Haitian satanic Vodoun
cult, which has been manipulated by the CIA/Illuminati, has sorcerers
called bokors. The Vodoun cult in Haiti is being used for trauma-based
mind control. One of the items of the cult is to take the plant Datura
stramonium and add this plant with other things. The plant is the active
ingredient of a potent psychoactive drug, the zombi cucumber which
produces amnesia and a pseudo-death of the victim. The brain doesnt
die, but the mind is shut off.
The victim is brought back to life as a
zombie--a slave of the bokor. The powder to create a zombi is called
zombificant in French-creole. The ceremonies to kill and resurrect the
zombie are full of magic and demonology also.
Magic, drugs and demonology have always gone hand in
hand. Drugs remove the part of the will that prevents demonic
possession. Drugs are considered powerful demonizing substances by the
those skilled in Demonology. If demonic possession is seen as part of
mind-control, then cocaine, hashish, crack, and some of the other drugs
are part of the effort to enslave people. (The power of magic to kill,
just as the power of faith can heal, will be discussed in chapter 10.)
In Basutoland in Drakersbergs, the Zulu witchdoctors use drugs and
trauma to create tokoloshes (mind-controlled zombie slaves). It is said
that in recent years, they are using less children and more baboons and
monkeys to get tokoloshes. The point is that drugs have been and
continue to be used by the occult world for controlling people.
The intelligence agencies working through the U.S.
government financed drug research. An example is that Dr. Beecher of
Harvard University was given via the U.S. Army Surgeon Generals Office
$150,000 to investigate the development and application of drugs which
will aid in the establishment of psychological control.
Research into
drugs for mind-control began in 1947 at Bethesada Naval Hospital in
Maryland. A CIA report described this research as to isolate and
synthesize pure drugs for use in effecting psychological entry and
control of the individual. At the California Medical Facility at
Vacaville, Dr. Arthur Nugent, conducted research into drugs for mind
control under the auspices of the CIA. The Bureau of Narcotics worked
with the CIA to establish safe houses where drugs which were seized
were given to victims. Some other hospitals which began working with the
intelligence agencies with dispensing drugs for mind control include
Mount Sinai Hospital, Boston Psychopathic Hospital, University of
Illinois, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Valley Forge
General Hospital, Detroit Psychopathic Clinic, Mayo Clinic, the National
Institute of Health, and Letterman Hospital in the Presideo, CA.
The
military did drug research/programming at the Army Chemical School in
Ft. McClellan, AL and at the Edgewood Chemical Center. In 1958, Dr.
Louis Gottschalk, working for the CIA suggested that addictive drugs be
used to control people. Some GIs who became addicted to pain killing
drugs were subsequently blackmailed by withholding the painkillers until
they complied with the demands asked of them.
Cocaine has been
frequently given to Monarch slaves to get them addicted and give their
handlers more control over them. There is spray cocaine, and powdered
cocaine, etc. Because the Monarch slaves are used to haul drugs and to
launder the drug money, they are right in the middle of large supplies
of drugs. If you hear the expression The snow is falling it is the
Networks lingo for cocaine.
Cocaine is reported to give people a
feeling of power and to act as an aphrodisiac.
APPLICATIONS
FOR DRUGS IN PROGRAMMING
Drugs are used during programming. Although drugs
used to assist programming mean nothing to the common person, they each
have a specific purpose within a certain type of programming.
Some
specific uses for drugs during programming include:
-
Putting people into trance
-
Teaching alters to go deeper into trance to escape drug effects
-
Enhancing the trauma
-
Eroducing out of body experiences e. creating pain
-
Creating blood vessels that hurt, a pulsating pain, that runs through
the body
-
Controlling histamine production
-
Helping create illusions such as no hands, no feet, no face, no head
etc.
-
Teaching alters to stay in position
-
To assist other programming modalities, such as high tech harmonic
machines, which implant thoughts. (The machines are used in conjunction
with designer drugs.)
-
Hormones, for instance GnRH, which regulates the physiology of the
sexual growth, and is given to speed up sexual growth. Other body
developments may also be manipulated.
-
To enhance or reduce memory
-
To build the image of the programmers power
At this point, it is appropriate to point out that
the personalities of a multiple do not respond uniformly to the same
dose of the same drug. Understanding how a drug will effect particular
alters is a science in itself. If an alter is holding the body, it will
receive more of the effect of a drug. Lets say Paraldehyde is given to
a multiple.
A possible reaction would be that some alters will feel no
effect, some will be sedated to a drunken stupor, and child alters may
be unconscious or hyperactive. Chloral hydrate might put some alters to
sleep while others remain wide awake. Sometimes the personality holding
the body may fight the influence of a drug to keep the body.
Prochlorperazine is sometimes given by therapists to help alters cope
with nausea and vomiting. Most alters will be programmed not to accept
drugs except from their master. Lithium suppresses alter switching in
some systems. An alter to protect the system from the therapists
helpful medications may develop allergic responses. Alcohol is a drug.
The reaction of an alter System to it will again be varied. Child alters
may become unconscious, while the adult alters dont even become
inebriated by large quantities of hard liquor.
Within males, dangerous
violent personalities may take the body. Within the medical world, often
an approximate correct dosage will work. However, with the programming
the doses must be extremely fine tuned. Some of the best skilled medical
doctors and assistants help with the programming. The Illuminati will
initially give the small child a small dose of a drug. They will chart
its effect, give it a urinalysis to see how long it stays in the body
etc. This is just the testing stage, they are not doing any programming.
A number of drugs will be tested, but only one at a time. They clear a
childs body of a drug before they give it another one. They prefer not
to mix meds. They will start small to insure they dont overdose and
then increase the dosage until they notice the correct behavior pattern.
This will be charted in detail on the slaves chart.
Each childs body
chemistry is different, so the suggested dosages are only ball park
figures which are not precise enough. If too much of a drug is given,
the programmers can easily turn a child into a psychotic basket case.
One of the secrets of the Illuminati/Intelligence agencies is that they
have secret antidotes for most medications, which, if they have to give
them to a child, then they will. They will use an antidote, for
instance, to keep a child from going into heart failure. The Programmers
will have some helpful drugs and herbs on stock too. It is reported that
Glutamic Acid (1000 mg. 3 times/day) will take care of the intense
headaches that alters get from lots of switching.
Witch hazel leaves and
comfrey root will help internal bleeding.
Putting people into trance
About 90% of the population can be placed into the
somnambulistic (the deepest) hypnotic trance possible simply by giving
them hypnotic drugs. The prior list on pages 47-50 gives over 2 dozen
drugs that can be used to assist taking someone in hypnotic trance.
Special drugs have been designed which will place someone into a deep
trance very quickly.
If an alter is not being cooperative when they are
accessed, they can be locked in place mentally and given a quick shot of
a fast-acting hypnotic-inducing drug. One drug which was popular for
programming was demerol, which would be administered intravenously (an
IV). It takes about 5-7 minutes to take full effect after administration
via an I.V.
The dosage can be administered so that the effect remains
until the programming session is over. It may be administered about
every half hour if appropriate. Children will receive 1 to 2.2 mg/kg
dose. Another drug, a truth serum, also consistently works on people
making them totally compliant to any directive. Under Baradanga people
will give their bank account numbers and anything else a person might
want.
These type of drugs are almost sufficient in themselves to get
compliance out of a person. If one realizes that these drugs are used in
conjunction to torture, elaborate systems of lies and deception,
trauma-bonds, and all the rest of the sciences of mind-control used in
the programming, it is easy to see how they are producing totally
compliant human robots.
Teaching alters to go deeper into trance to escape drug effects and
pain
Much of the training in this area is based upon the
childs horror and fear toward the all powerful master programmer. When
the programmer wants the childs alters to learn to trance deeper, he
will give a drug that the alter doesnt like. The childs alter will
then be told to go deeper into the mind if they want to escape the
effect of the drug.
This enforces the dissociative state being trained
for the alter. The suggestion or story line that is given to the alter
is frequently the picture of a train. The child is told that the
conductor is at the front of the train, but he must move to the back of
the train through the train cars. The child is taught to count cars when
they go by as if they were steps in the mind.
This is training the child
to descend into deeper levels of the subconscious. The train
illustration has been used by programmers when they want the child to
remember the drug experience. The programmer wants this experience
remembered--at least for a while because it helps increase the childs
fear.
If the programmer wants the child to forget the drug experience
while learning trance depths, then the imagery of a plane taking off and
disappearing in the clouds works.
Enhancing the trauma
Drugs will be used to enhance the spinning effect
when the mind is being programmed to have vortexes and to set up traps
within the slaves mind. One particular drug enhances the trauma by 100
times.
Drugs can be useful for instance, to enhance a childs terror of
the experience of this child being placed in a small box in the fetal
position for 24 hours. This helps shorten the programming time, and it
also makes the programming more intense. The programmers know what
antidotes to give to pull the child out of the enhancement. Marijuana
enhances perception of color and noise, but it is not used to enhance
trauma.
The mind does not program well under
marijuana. That is why there has been such a big campaign to keep it
illegal, even though many studies show it to be safer than alcohol.
Producing out of body experiences
Various hallucinogenic drugs, LSD included, will
produce an out of body experience for the victim, if the drugs are
administered correctly. The Programmer will prepare the victim with
various information and story lines during the administration of the
drug. Monarch slaves are being deprogrammed, they may have a memory
where their skin feels inflamed and itchy, like a bad mosquito bite.
The
experience may also have the sensation of floating in an unreal world.
This may well be an LSD trip given the slave during experimentation and
programming. The CIA was using LSD beginning in the very early part of
the 1950s. Several victims report that some type of potion causes a
person to dream while they are awake.
PCP which is angel dust is one
way to disconnect the cortex from the limbic system and go into an
altered state.
Creating pain
This is done with a long list of drugs. Drops of salt
water and pepper water are applied to the eyes of victims to make their
eyes sting. Another pain in the eye takes place when lights are flashed
signalling, I love you, I love you not. The child is pulled two ways
by this message.
Dr. Green (Mengele) enjoyed pulling daisy petals while
saying these words. If the last petal was I love you not, the child
would be put to death. Surviving children were left traumatized.
Creating blood vessels that hurt
Blood pressure is raised by drugs and then certain
drugs are added which make the veins burn. The alter is taught to cut
the burning veins. This is programming which is laid in to control the
slave from straying from the script he or she is given.
If they stray,
then a cutting program is activated which was laid in via a combination
of drugs in the method just stated.
Controlling histamine production
The control of histamine production is an important
secret ingredient to the Monarch Mind Control. The breast implants
placed into women help stimulate histamine production, which is used in
conjunction with drug-assisted programming (See Chapter 8.)
Helping create illusions such as no hands, no feet, no face, no head
etc
A programmer working with a hallucinogenic drug can
make an alter believe that it has lost a particular body part. Because
most of these alters have little memory or no memory and little frame of
reference, what they are told while under the influence of drugs seems
very real to them.
Teaching alters to stay in position
Some alters dont like to stay in position. But
through the use of drugs, and the side effect of drugs, they soon learn
the importance of staying in position. If they are disobedient, the
memory of the bad side effects from not staying in position in the mind
can be pulled up by a code and the alter can relive the pain from having
disobediently moved from position.
This is very effective in teaching
alters to stay in their little position that is assigned them in the
mind.
To assist other programming modalities, such as high tech
harmonic machines, which implant thoughts. (The machines are used in
conjunction with designer drugs.) An example of how drugs can be
important is as follows. The neurons in the hippocampus which is part of
the memory process use acetylcholine.
Drugs that block acetylcholine
interfere with memory. The neurons and the chemical neural transmitters
are understood much better today. Where and how a thought is created in
the brain is understood by the programmers in detail. No one is in a
position to physically prevent the Illuminati and others from taking
their children and others to labs where chemicals and harmonics can be
used in sophisticated computer guided ways to implant thoughts into the
childrens minds. As the childs brain is shaped according to its
environment, the level of everyday brain chemicals and the shape of the
various areas of the brain can be determined by the programmers.
This is
why a recent article on Prozac (Newsweek, Feb. 7, 1994) uses a quote
from Alice In Wonderland for its title, One pill makes you
larger, and one pill makes you small.
This article (on page 38) quotes
brain researcher Restak,
For the first time, we will be in a position
to design our own brain. On the previous page in big letters it reads,
Scientific insights into the brain are raising the prospect of
made-to-order, off-the-shelf personalities.
Another programming modality assisted by drugs is
behavior modification. Aversion therapy using a vomit-inducing drug is
used on children. Another example of drugs helping assist programming is
to give someone LSD and then interview the child while it is
hallucinating.
The hallucinations are then used as programming building
blocks by using hypnotic techniques. One way to build on a LSD trip is
to tell the child if they ever do a particular thing (such as touch
programming, remember programming, and integrate parts, etc.) the victim
is to go crazy and hallucinate like they are presently doing. This means
that they will be locked up in a crazy house for the rest of their life.
Rather than be put in straight-jackets with other crazy people it would
be better for the person to commit suicide. By constantly reinforcing
this message, some alters will adopt the script that they are doing the
body good to kill it if any alter personality touches the programming,
because otherwise the body will be locked up in a crazy house.
Drugs are used in programming to establish a pattern
or a script. There must be a pattern of dissociation. Parts cant just
dissociate into nothing, otherwise there would be nothing to build on.
Drugs will play a major role in the structuring of the alter system,
which is covered in chapter 7.
The child doesnt know where the effect of the drug
is coming from. The programmer will take credit for the power of the
drug. Whoever administers the drug has power in the childs mind. The
mind wants to be safe. I am familiar with a recent example here in
Oregon of someone who escaped from being sacrificed at a Satanic Ritual.
The legal system told the woman she was crazy when she reported to the
police that she had escaped from a Satanic Ritual where they were going
to sacrifice her. To control her, the judge ordered 3 types of antipsychotics, twice the normal dose of two kinds of lithium carbonate
to put her into a lethargic stupor, Paxil as an antidepressant, and
Benztropine mesylate as an antiparkinsonian agent. The antipsychotics
were Thiothixene, Thioridazine hydrochloride, and Perphenazine which are
all addictive.
This woman may or may not be a multiple. But this clearly
shows the type of mental control via drugs that could be slapped onto
someone who dares report Satanic activity to an establishment which has
been sadly corrupted from top to bottom. One victim of government mind
control tried to get free. The first psychiatrist the person tried to go
to was cooperating with U.S. Intelligence and gave her Stelazine, which
aggravated the victims situation.
When the victim spied a generals
uniform in the closet of this psychiatrist, she got another
psychiatrist, who unfortunately turned out to be an ex-DoD employee. He
placed her on Haldol Decanoate, Klonopin, and Benzatropine. The combined
effect of these drugs is to erase memory, and create a dissociative
disorder.
All of the drugs were highly addicted. Another fleeing victim
was given Trazodone by a physician who was cooperating with the
Intelligence agencies. This almost gave the victim a heart attack
because it aggravated her heart condition. And yet another escaping
victim apparently also fell prey to dirty CIA doctors who were
practicing in public without warning people of their intelligence
connections.
This victim was given a combination of Compazine and
Xanax,
in dosages that the Physicians Desk Reference warns against. The
doctor, who prescribed this, worked out of an office named after an MK
Ultra programmer. There are other important things to mention about when
drugs are used in Monarch programming.
Some of the cautions that the
programmers are alert to include:
a. watching the heart so that it doesnt stop. Many
of the children who have been programmed have died from heart failure.
The programmers are very careful to have heart monitors on the victim,
and to have paddles ready to revive the body. Because so much of their
drugging affects the heart, they accept that they will lose a few to
heart failure.
b. making sure that drugs arent given to children
who are allergic to them. The programmers take the time to insure that
they have the family histories of allergies to drugs, and they will test
the children too, before proceeding with drugs. They not only learn the
family & individual responses to drugs, but they can test during
programming to determine a drugs blood level in a child. For instance,
pentobarbital at a blood level of 5 mcg/ml aids hypnosis, at 15
makes the victim comatose with reflexes, and at 30 makes the person
comatose w/ extreme difficulty in breathing. In everyday life, 30 mcg/ml
would kill the child. Pentobarbital blood levels can be tested by an
enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique. For longer-acting Phenobarbital
gas chromatography is used. TCAs are tested by radioimmunoassay,
high-perf. liquid chromatography & thin layer chromatography. Some
hypnotics are tested by colorimetry, photometry, & spectrophotometry.
c. switching to herbs when the body is saturated with
drugs. When the childs body has had all the manufactured drugs it can
absorb, the programmers switch to a vast collection of natural herbs.
d. providing the antidote for AIDS. Monarch slaves
are routinely given the antidote for AIDS and have been since the
1960s-1970s.
e. knowing how much of a drug each part can take,
small young alters cant take as much. Multiples within a single system
have varying levels of tolerance toward drugs. A small child alter may
be killed by an adult dosage, even though the age of the body is that of
an adult. The programmers are acutely aware of how to deal with multiple
personalities.
f. providing salt to balance the electrolytes in the
mind of a programmed multiple personality. An electrolyte imbalance can
cause a multiple personalitys mind to go wacky and start spinning. The
Multiple could possibly go into shock and die. The programmers are very
experienced in understanding the unique requirements of a multiple
personality.
g. An important plant extract for watching brain wave
activity is the large plant enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP).
Perhaps it would be worthwhile to briefly mention
that all the major chemical and drug companies are run by the
Illuminati.
It would take a book to explain who controls what and how
they connect in, and this author could write it. Instead, we will try to
give a quick over view. Rather than cover 2 dozen large drug companies,
three major drug companies have been randomly selected to show a quick
view of how all the drug companies are deeply involved with Monarch
mind-control programming.
Since the purpose of this book is to show how
the mind control is done--this sample of names is given only to convey
to the reader that the drugs that the Illuminati/Intelligence agencies
need are never in short supply.
And the labs to develop designer drugs
for mind-control are not in short supply either.

SUMMARY
As the reader can see, the use of drugs in the
Monarch Trauma-based Mind Control is extensive and requires skilled
technicians, nurses, and doctors.
Because of the long-held control by
the Illuminati families over narcotics and drug manufacture/sales, there
is no difficulty for the programmers to get large quantities of secret
designer drugs. The minor occult cults have to get by with a more
limited supply of mind altering drugs, unless they directly connect in
with the bigger picture.
The power of drugs to control a persons life
is not absolute - although someone who lives with a cocaine addict or
alcoholic might disagree - but when coupled with all the other methods in
a sophisticated system of mind-control, drugs just further reinforce the
absolute power of the Illuminati over an individual.
