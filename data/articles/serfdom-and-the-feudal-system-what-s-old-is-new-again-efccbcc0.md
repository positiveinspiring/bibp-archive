The period of history from the 5th to the 15th
century was known as the Middle Ages.
During this time, the law of the land in Europe was known as
the feudal system. This was the manner in which the upper
10% (the nobility) controlled the lower 90% (the serfs or
peasants).
There were a few kings who were very wealthy and powerful,
who owned all of the land. To maintain control of this land,
it was broken into fiefdoms and pieces were given to friends
of the kings (barons).
The barons then allotted land to their friends and allies in
order to govern efficiently. It was in this manner that the
nobility was created, and the land passed down through
these select few families by manner of inheritances.
The reward of being delegated this control came at a price.
To maintain the control of the fiefdoms, manors and estates,
the nobility had to pledge fealty to the kings and pay them
taxes and homage.
It is estimated that just over 90% of the population of
Europe were peasants. Most peasants were basically slaves.
They were provided with a small shelter on an inferior piece
of land and the protection of the noble in charge of that
area. In return, they worked for the estate, farming the
land with no recompense, paying taxes and having no control
over their own lives.
Some peasants were free and had their own small
businesses: blacksmiths, carpenters, bakers, etc. They paid
for the protection of the lord with money, goods and
services.
Peasants had few rights. They could be taxed at any time,
were obligated to use (and pay for) services of the manor
like mills or large ovens, and had to request permission for
marriages, change of locations or educating their children.
Each year, the peasant was required to give the best part of
his harvest to the lord of the manor. The peasants were not
allowed to own things that made their lives easier, like
oxen or horses, for example.
A
peasant did not own the land on which he lived and was
therefore obligated to live where he was told, grow what he
was told, and farm in the manner in which he was told.
They were not allowed to hunt on the lords land - poaching
was an offense punishable by death. They were not allowed to
cut trees for firewood, but forced to gather fallen branches
in order to stay warm.
A
peasant was not allowed to have real, effective weapons -
those were reserved for the armies of the nobility, in order
to keep the peasants in line and immediately quell any quest
for dignity and independence.
Most of the peasants seemed content with the arrangement
because they received security and safety from the lord. He
was obligated to protect them from marauders and barbarians,
and provide enough land for subsistence.
Serfs could be used as a commodity, and traded.
If the control of the land changed hands, the serfs were
included in the transaction.
Is it really a leap to say that we are
still participating in the feudal system?
Members of
the
Global Elite still meet and choose the leaders of the world,
based on which of those leaders will swear fealty by agreeing to the
agenda set forth by said elite.
The Bilderberg group, with their influence
on world policy and finance, are the king-makers - future leaders are vetted
by them, then their campaigns are fully funded. In this way, control
trickles down but it is just one small group of people who actually call the
shots.
On a more local level, think about the home you
own.
The properties that we think we own are taxed on an annual basis in
most places. As the economic debt goes higher and higher every year, so do
our property taxes. As we improve our properties, our taxes increase. If you
think you really own your home or land, try skipping your tax payment and
youll see how quickly the true owners appear. We are merely tenants.
Our income taxes go up every time the barons government,
needs more money.
This leaves us with less money for us to feed
our families. Income tax is not optional - it comes off your paycheck before
you see a dime of it. You are paying for the privilege of working.
We must be granted permission and pay even more
taxes for the privilege of going about our every day lives. We must purchase
a license to drive on the roads, build on our properties, or hunt and fish
to feed our families.
Even with a license, hunting is only allowed at
certain times per year - self-sufficiently feeding your family with game
outside the specific 2 week windows throughout the year is illegal.
If we farm, we are obligated to comply with
overbearing regulations in order to sell our home-raised food to others. If
we choose to farm without chemicals and toxins, we arent allowed to
advertise the fact without filling out crippling
reams of paperwork.
We must bow to
the FDA and destroy some of the nutrients
in our food (pasteurization) if we want to sell it to others.
Speaking of monopolies,
Monsanto, aided and abetted by friends at
the FDA, is attempting to take over the farming industry. If a farmer
refuses to use the frankenseeds, and a bit of pollen drifts over from a
nearby farm who has sold out to Big Agri, the independent farmer can be
taken to court and sued into oblivion, losing his property and his
livelihood.
If we choose to educate our children at home and
raise independent thinkers, we must also be subject to oversight. Most
states have a governing board which tests home-schooled children on an
annual basis.
Parents are told what their children must learn
and the timeline on which they must learn it. Parents are still taxed to
subsidize the schools that their children do not attend and must pay out of
pocket for the approved educational material they must use to teach the
children.
The government frowns upon children being
independently educated, as this does not create the obedient serfs that the
public schools system is designed to churn out.
In return for all of the permissions we must
purchase annually, we are all under the protective wing of our respective
governments. These feudal lords dole out food via welfare programs,
healthcare and medication via government standards, and brainwashing education
for the children.
In the US, for example,
the rubicon has been
crossed in that more people receive benefits from a government program
than do not. The system is not designed to help people get back on their
feet - it has been created to establish a system of dependency.
People are forcibly injected with toxic vaccines
and doled out psychiatric medications. Whereas once education was not legal,
now people are being purposely dumbed down and chemically subdued in order
to quell any thought of rebellion. A government-induced apathy keeps the
masses tame and docile.
Weapons have already been restricted in many
countries and are being targeted by the US government right now.
Only the knights - er..., the military and the
police - should have weapons, in order to quell any potential rebellion by
the peasants - us. The US government has famously made enormous purchases of
weapons and ammunition over the past year, while working diligently to
remove weapons from the hands of the people.
Agenda 21, a document devised by the United
Nations, goes even further to separate the 90% from the 10%.
In the name of tree-hugging largess,
A-21 is quietly working to round up the peasants and place them in cities,
with massive restrictions on their movement. Through public transit that
only goes to certain places, A-21 is keeping the peasants on the estate.
People are shoehorned into tiny apartments with
no opportunity to become self-sufficient and grown their own food. Using
national land (parks) requires payment in many areas.
Even the collection and use of rainwater is
being targeted by Agenda 21, sending the very clear message: WE OWN
EVERYTHING.
The original
feudal system began to decline with the
Peasants Revolt in 1381.
After
the
Black Death reduced the population by over one-third, there were not
enough peasants to get in the harvests. The serfs seized the
opportunity, refusing to work, refusing to pay rent and running away
from the estates on which they lived. The lords were forced to negotiate
with better terms for the peasants in order to get them to work.
The monarchy,
however, was not pleased with this and began to levy even more taxes on
the peasants (austerity measures?). The peasants ended up revolting
violently, storming the tower of London, executing financiers and
noblemen, and burning down castles.
The nobles
quickly mobilized a militia and squelched the revolt. The leaders of the
uprising were publicly executed.
Although the
revolt was not seen as a success, it was the beginning of the end for
the medieval feudal system, as the nobles realized that the peasants had
the power of numbers behind them and that they could wreak havoc by
simply refusing to work.
What lessons can we take from this?
As there has always been, there are those who
want
a one-world government, divided into small
controllable segments, ruled over by those who will support the power
agenda, swearing loyalty to the elite.
These elite use the following tactics to
manipulate the masses: government sponsored false
flag events, incrementalism, dumbing down the population, programming
opinions through media and popular culture, and entertainment
distractions (bread and circuses).
Only with unified effort will the people to
live in dignity and equality. If only 5% of the people refuse to serve the
elite, there are still billions more to take our places. It is vital to
spread awareness.
Just as the mainstream media drills submission
into the subconscious of the masses, we must hammer away at
their perceived reality.
-
Vote with your wallets - refuse to
support the massive corporations owned by the global elite. Stop
buying into their theories on the latest items you must have.
Dont shop at their slave-labor big box stores, dont eat their
mass-produced food-like substances and dont take their deadly
medications. Put them out of business by refusing to participate
and make sure others know why you are doing it.
-
Strive for self-sufficiency. Grow your
food, purchase what you cannot grow yourself from local farmers and
learn to live with what you can provide for yourself. Providing for
yourself is your God-given right, not a permission to be granted by
the elite, the government or the big corporations.
-
Be aware of the creeping presence of
Agenda 21 - fight it every step of the way by shedding light on the
plan. Contradict the warm fuzzy language and enlighten people about
the land grabs, the ownership of nature and the corralling of humans
into controlled areas.
-
Refuse to participate in benefits
programs - this system is designed to encourage dependency, and
through dependency, control.
The most important step of all is shining the
light on the secret plans of who consider the rest of us peasants, put here
to serve them.
Dont be discouraged if efforts to revolt
against this control do not immediately succeed. It took a couple hundred
years to make feudalism illegal the first time around. Resist. Teach the
next generation to do the same.
Learn from the past to create a different future
- this is just a new spin on a theme that is ages-old.
"Those
who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it."

Winston Churchill
