This chapter of Solving 9-11 reveals a very significant part of the
extensive Israeli and Zionist criminal network, which the evidence indicates
was behind the crime of the century.
The information in this chapter, which
comes from material in the public domain, strongly supports the thesis that
senior officers from Israeli military intelligence agencies were the chief
architects of the false-flag terror of 9-11.
The spectacular explosions that accompanied the crashes (WTC 2)
produced light flame and whitish smoke (seen on left; impact area),
which is indicative of Thermite in the two computer rooms struck.
The bizarre explosions that shot out of the east
and north side of WTC 1 came from the
computer room of Marsh Kroll, a Zionist-owned
company that has profited from the "War on Terror."

"But now, nearly seven years since 9/11, it's past time to be moving on."
- "Only Dust Remains," New York Post, July 9, 2008
There is no reason good can't triumph over evil, if only angels will get
organized along the lines of the Mafia.
- Kurt Vonnegut, A Man Without a Country, 2005
These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the
sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their
country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and
woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
- Thomas Paine, The American Crisis, 1776
Thomas Paine was the most popular and inspirational writer of the American
Revolution.
"The cause of America," Paine wrote in Common Sense (1776), "is
in a great measure the cause of all mankind."
In 1787, having "stood out the storm of one revolution," i.e. the American,
and with "no wish to embark in another," Paine returned to Europe and wound
up playing a role in the French Revolution and nearly losing his head.
To the Citizens of the United States is a series of letters written by Paine
in 1802-03, when he returned to America after an absence of almost 15 years.
In the first letter, Paine wrote:
"But while I beheld with pleasure the dawn
of liberty rising in Europe, I saw with regret the lustre of it fading in
America. In less than two years from the time of my departure some distant
symptoms painfully suggested the idea that the principles of the Revolution
were expiring on the soil that produced them."
"A faction, acting in disguise, was rising in America; they had lost sight
of first principles," Paine wrote. "They were beginning to contemplate
government as a profitable monopoly, and the people as hereditary property."
Two hundred years later, as an American student of history, I made the same
observation: A faction, acting in disguise, was rising in America. This
faction also viewed government as a profitable monopoly, which they sought
to control.
The rising faction I noticed taking control in the 1980s was
primarily Jewish by ethnicity and Zionist by ideology.
LIVING IN JEWISH TIMES

the symbol of the Zionist state of Israel.
Sharon, a known terrorist and war criminal,
became prime minister in 2001.
"I want to tell you something very clear. Don't worry about American
pressure on Israel. We, the Jewish people, control America and the Americans
know it."
- Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to Foreign Minister Shimon Peres,
October 2001
After spending several years in Europe, Israel, and the Middle East, I
returned to the United States in the late 1970s and found the discourse in
the media about Zionism to be extremely one-sided and distorted.
Zionism, a
racist ideology if ever there was one, was grossly misrepresented in the
U.S. mass media as being a progressive and democratic movement of national
liberation while Israel was depicted as being a kosher slice of America in
the Middle East. It was very clear that the people distorting the view of
the Middle East were themselves Jews devoted to the very un-American
political and racial agenda called Zionism, the violent and chauvinistic
nationalism of Eastern European Jews which has brutally occupied Palestine
since 1948.
Honest and unbiased coverage of Israel and the Middle East became
increasingly difficult to find in the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s. The
sale of Ted Turner's progressive Cable News Network (CNN) to
Gerald Levine
of AOL Time Warner and the transformation of the informative Christian
Science Monitor marked the end of the last independent and unbiased news
outlets covering the Middle East. An ethnic minority group with a foreign
agenda Zionism had gained monopoly control over the U.S. mass media.
The Jewish monopoly of the U.S. media coincided with the United States being
drawn more deeply into the Arab-Israeli conflict as the primary supporter,
financier, and political ally of the Zionists.
This combination has been
extremely detrimental for America and disastrous for the people of the
region, as the criminal Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 clearly showed.
U.S. Marines removing the dead
from their bombed barracks in Beirut, 1983.
The U.S. intervention in Lebanon was disastrous
for Americans, Lebanese, and Palestinians.
Aware of the increasing prevalence and dominance of Zionist Jews in the
political, financial, and academic sectors, I came to the conclusion that I
was living in Jewish times.
As an American raised with traditional Christian values, I realized that the
culture I had grown up in was under attack and being reduced to a
sub-culture. Through the Jewish-controlled media, a distinctly foreign and
anti-Christian culture of pornography, perversion, and violence was being
pushed. The producers of this "new culture" were primarily Jews of Eastern
European origin. Through their control of the mass media, film, radio, and
television networks, a diet of perverse entertainment and un-American values
was being force-fed to the unsuspecting American people.
Concurrent with the rise of the Jewish-Zionist faction in the U.S. media was
the significant increase in Jewish power in the executive, legislative, and
judicial branches of government.
Their influence could be seen in the way
the U.S. government and federal courts unfairly prosecuted innocent people,
including the president of Austria, on unfounded allegations of crimes
having been committed decades ago against Jews in distant countries.
Meanwhile, there was a noticeable increase in the number and magnitude of
crimes committed by Jews in the United States and the international arena
that went completely unpunished.
As in the Soviet Union, Jewish criminals in America used the "holocaust" and
the slanderous charge of anti-Semitism as a shield to protect their criminal
network and extortion rackets by intimidating and silencing those who would
dare to expose the monstrous crimes they were involved in.
A secret
"combination" or Zionist network was clearly at work pulling the strings at
the highest level behind the scenes.
THE ISRAELI ARCHITECTS OF 9-11
- "It's very good"

"It's very good."
- Benjamin Netanyahu, when asked what 9-11 meant for U.S.-Israeli relations;
New York Times, September 12, 2001.
"We are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attack on the Twin Towers
and Pentagon, and the American struggle in Iraq."
- Benjamin Netanyahu, as quoted in Ma'ariv, April 16, 2008
The "false-flag" terrorism of 9-11 is a monstrous Jewish-Zionist crime of
our time.
The true culprits of this heinous crime are clearly being
protected by a gang of like-minded Jewish Zionists in the highest positions
of the U.S. government, particularly at the U.S. Dept. of Justice and in the
federal court system where justice for the victims of 9-11 has been
obstructed and delayed for more than 6 years.
The lies and deception about 9-11, spread by the Zionist-controlled media,
have been accepted as truth by millions of Americans. Based on a fairy tale
spun from the outrageous terror spectacle, a fraudulent "War on Terror," a
Zionist construct against our American liberties, and at least three
extremely costly and illegal wars of aggression in Afghanistan, Iraq, and
Somalia, are being waged. Countless thousands of lives have been wasted and
more than one thousand billion dollars have been spent on this criminal
enterprise and there is still no end in sight to the madness.
The controlled media has completely ignored the evidence of Israeli
involvement in 9-11 and refused to investigate any of the unanswered
questions about what really happened that day. Likewise, the media has
avoided doing any serious investigation of the official version of events,
which is simply not believable due to the large number of inconsistencies
and complete lack of supporting evidence.
As a result, the public has been left with a confusing mixture of fact,
fiction, and disinformation from which the truth is very hard to discern. It
is unacceptable for a baseless fairy tale to pass for truth while the real
history is suppressed and muddled.
Solving 9-11 is my attempt to clarify
this muddled history by discovering and exposing the true culprits.
"But let them go on," Paine wrote about the rising faction of his time,
"give them rope enough and they will put an end to their own insignificance.
There is too much common sense and independence in America to be long the
dupe of any faction, foreign or domestic."
Paine was, however, writing long before television became the most pervasive
and powerful thought-control device on the planet. Given the fact that the
majority of Americans now rely on television for their news and
understanding of world events, I am not so sure that America will not
continue to be deceived and manipulated by the Zionist faction that controls
the mass media.
The Jewish faction controlling the media and government has done immense and
irreparable damage to our republic and national prestige. Today, our once
great nation is in dire straits economically, politically, and morally.
Absent a revolution or sea change in political thinking, I am not optimistic
that there will be any justice for the victims and relatives of 9-11 or that
the real culprits will ever be held accountable in a U.S. court.
I am, however, convinced that the truth of 9-11 is of the utmost importance
and that the guilty must be exposed. We all need to know who did it and how
they did it.
The reasons why it was done have become increasingly obvious
from the criminal wars of aggression and oppressive "homeland security"
apparatus that have followed in its wake.
9-11 - THE ISRAELI THESIS
"Consistency is close to being the mark of a set of true beliefs;
it is at least rationally compelling."
- Robin Waterfield on the Socratic dialectic, Plato's Gorgias, 1994
"The worst thing in the world," Socrates said, "the supreme curse, is to do
wrong and not pay the penalty for it."
I believe that the available evidence
and facts are sufficient to disprove the official version and that the truth
of 9-11 is within our reach. The guilty must be found.
9-11 is an unsolved crime; the fairy tale promoted by the government and
controlled media has not been proven because it is not provable. Finding the
truth about 9-11 requires using the Socratic method to ask questions and
develop a thesis from what can be proven to be true.
Since the day it happened, I have been asking questions about Israeli
involvement in 9-11 because of the early and clear evidence, made public, of
prior knowledge by the five dancing Israelis and members of an Israeli
instant messaging network called Odigo. From the beginning, therefore, I
considered the possibility that 9-11 was an Israeli-produced false-flag
terror spectacle. The Zionists, after all, have a long history of doing
these kinds of things.
I investigated and researched to see if the evidence supported this thesis.
I found a great deal of evidence consistent with the Israeli thesis, which I
have examined for nearly 7 years. I have discovered that agents of Israeli
military intelligence or people devoted to the Zionist cause occupied every
key position in the 9-11 saga. This consistency has led me to believe that
the Israeli thesis is correct.
This chapter of Solving 9-11 reveals a very significant part of the
extensive Israeli and Zionist criminal network, which the evidence indicates
was behind the crime of the century. The information in this chapter, which
comes from material in the public domain, strongly supports the thesis that
senior officers from Israeli military intelligence agencies were the chief
architects of the false-flag terror of 9-11.
The truth can be deduced from the available facts and evidence, and as
Socrates said,
"The truth can never be proved wrong."
"THE MAGNITUDE OF PLANNING"
Some day, perhaps, if it's decided that the stories can be told, you'll see
that the state [Israel] has been involved in acts which are a thousand times
more dirty than anything going on in Colombia. But these things were decided
by the government, in cabinet meetings.
As long as the government decides to
do something, something that the national interest demanded, then it is
legitimate. But if an individual wants to do the same thing, it isn't.
That's just the way it is. It's very simple.
- Lieut. Gen. Rafael Eitan, Israeli Chief of Staff, 1978-83
"The Colombia Connection," Jerusalem Post, September 1, 1989
In December 2001, I spoke with Eckehardt Werthebach, the former head of the
Verfassungsschutz, the domestic branch of German intelligence, about the
terror attacks of 9-11.
"The deathly precision" and "the magnitude of
planning" behind the attacks would have required "years of planning," Werthebach said.
Such a sophisticated operation, he said, would have required the "fixed
frame" of a state intelligence organization, something not found in the
"loose group" like the one allegedly led by Mohammed Atta while he studied
in Hamburg. The nebulous Al Qaida and the Taliban of Afghanistan clearly
lacked the "fixed frame" of a state intelligence organization.
Many people would have been involved in the planning of such an operation
and the absence of leaks was a further indication that the attacks were
"state organized actions," Werthebach said.
Andreas von Buelow, the former head of the parliamentary commission that
oversaw the German intelligence agencies, told me that a sophisticated
false-flag operation like 9-11 has an organizational structure with three
basic levels: architectural, operational, and working. Atta and the 19 Arabs
blamed as the "hijackers" of 9-11 were part of the working level, von Buelow
said, and were simply part of the deception. That is, after all, how
false-flag terror works.
Von Buelow said that he believed that the Mossad, Israel's foreign
intelligence service, was behind the terror attacks of 9-11. These attacks,
he said, were designed to turn public opinion against the Arabs, and to
boost military and security spending.
Six years later, with more than one
thousand billion U.S. taxpayer dollars wasted on the fraudulent "war on
terror" and the disastrous and costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, there is
no question that 9-11 has been crassly exploited to push military and
security spending through the roof.
"You don't get the higher echelons," von Buelow said, referring to the
"architectural structure," which masterminds such false-flag terror attacks.
At this level, he said, the organization doing the planning, such as Mossad,
is primarily interested in affecting public opinion.
It goes without saying
that the mass media must be tightly controlled in order for such large-scale
deception to succeed.
"Ninety-five percent of the work of the intelligence agencies around the
world is deception and disinformation," von Buelow said, which is widely
propagated in the mainstream media creating an accepted version of events.
"Journalists don't even raise the simplest questions," he said, adding,
"Those who differ are labeled as crazy."
TERROR AS DECEPTION
"Terror is theatre."
- John Le Carré, The Little Drummer Girl, 1983
"Terror is theatre and theatre is illusion" is the theme of The Little
Drummer Girl , the realistic novel about Israeli false-flag operations in
Europe written by the late John Le Carré.
"On the old reality we impose the new fiction," said Joseph, the Israeli
agent in the book engaged in creating a false history for a Palestinian
"terrorist" in the same way false histories were created for the 9-11
"hijackers".
"Terror is theatre," another character says. "We inspire, we frighten, we
awaken indignation, anger
The guerrilla is the great actor of the world."
Illusion is what theatre is all about, the main character, a British
actress, says:
"Theatre's a con trick. Do you know what that means? Con
trick? You've been deceived."
Le Carré gave a "sincere thanks" to "certain past and serving officers" of
Israeli intelligence in his forward to the book. He expressed "special
gratitude" to General Shlomo Gazit, the former chief of Israeli military
intelligence.
The Israeli characters in The Little Drummer Girl come through without a
scratch while Palestinians and Europeans are blown to bits in engineered
false-flag terrorism. In one scene, a kidnapped Palestinian is put into the
trunk of a car, which is then exploded at a rest area on the German
Autobahn.
"'Disinformation,' we used to call it, designed to misguide the enemy's
eye, and very nice too," Picton, the angry and sarcastic British police
commander scolds the Mossad agent after viewing the Israeli presentation of
fabricated evidence. "But that's too simple for you and Misha. Being a bunch
of over-educated fanatics, you've gone one further. 'No dead meat for us, oh
no! We'll use live meat. Arab meat. Dutch meat.' So you did. And you blew it
up in a nice Mercedes motorcar. Theirs."
Similar Israeli techniques have long been used in "suicide bombs" in
occupied Palestine, Iraq, and Afghanistan to kill and maim thousands of
innocent people and foment sectarian violence.
These terrorist bombings are
now routinely blamed on "suicide bombers" without examining the evidence.
"Of the Palestinians," whose real-life stories informed the plot of The
Little Drummer Girl, "some are dead, others are taken prisoner, the rest
presumably are for the most part homeless or dispersed," Le Carré wrote in
July 1982 as the Israeli military led by the Zionist terrorist and war
criminal Ariel Sharon carried out new atrocities on a daily basis in
Lebanon.
Thousands of Palestinians were slain
in the Israeli-orchestrated massacre
of Sabra and Shatilla in September 1982.
An Israeli commission found Sharon
personally responsible.
18 years later, as a war criminal,
he became prime minister.
Sharon, a well-known genocidaire from the extreme right-wing Likud party
became prime minister of Israel in early 2001 as George W. Bush entered the
White House as an un-elected president, creating the same dangerous
political and ideological conjunction that had produced the illegal invasion
of Lebanon in 1982.
THE "FIXED FRAME" OF 9-11
If one accepts Werthebach's expert judgment that "the magnitude of planning"
behind 9-11 required the "fixed frame" of a state intelligence organization,
then there should be evidence of such an organization connecting the key
players of the operational network behind the crime. If we can only discern
some elements or identify some of the key people in this network, we should
be able to discover other key people involved in the organization through
their mutual connections.
In order to carry out the sophisticated terror attacks of 9-11, the
architects would have had to create an organizational structure in the
United States over a period of years, or even decades. This structure is
needed to connect the key individuals and crucial points of the crime,
including those involved in the on-going non-investigation and cover-up. All
the bases have to be covered.
The organizational structure is required to provide secure channels or
"pipelines" for the criminal organization, the conduits through which the
terror operation is set up and carried out.
A secure conduit could be a
company, a group of people, or even a single individual. The most important
thing is that it be wholeheartedly devoted to the organization. When the
9-11 structure was complete and the wiring in place, the switch was thrown
and the long-planned terror atrocity became real.
There is simply no evidence whatsoever that any such "Al Qaida" or Islamic
terrorist structure ever existed in the United States or that any Muslim or
Arab organization was interested in or capable of carrying out such a
sophisticated attack. There is, on the other hand, a great deal of evidence
that an Israeli military structure, which employed Arab disguises when
necessary, is behind 9-11.
This network connects the highest officers and
veterans of Israeli military intelligence with all the key players,
companies, and funding entities involved in setting up the 9-11 attacks.
There is evidence of an Israeli military intelligence matrix connecting
every key player and entity behind 9-11. At the most crucial position in
U.S. law enforcement, for example, where executive decisions were made
concerning the federal non-investigation, sat Michael Chertoff, an Israeli
whose mother was one of the first agents of Israeli intelligence. Having the
devoted Zionist Michael Chertoff in the key position as Asst. Attorney
General controlling the criminal division of the Dept. of Justice gave the
Israelis the operational security to carry out this massive crime without
fear of exposure or prosecution.
Chertoff also played a central role in the
prosecution of the 1993 false-flag terror bombing at the World Trade Center.
Michael Chertoff, Homeland Security chief,
is an Israeli through his mother.
As Asst. Attorney General running
the Criminal Division at the Dept. of Justice in 2001,
he supervised the "non-investigation" of 9-11.
Likewise, two dedicated Zionists-cum-federal judges named Alvin K. Hellerstein and
Michael B. Mukasey have overseen virtually all the
litigation from the massive death and destruction of 9-11 as well as the
1993 false-flag incident at the WTC.
Small wonder there has yet to be a
single trial for any of the 96 families who chose to seek justice through
the courts rather than accept the government pay-out for the loss of their
loved ones. Less than two months before the 7th anniversary of 9-11, fewer
than 7 of the original 96 cases remain to be settled and still no trial is
planned for any of the victims of 9-11.
This can hardly be called justice
for the relatives. As they say, "Justice delayed is justice denied."
The appalling absence of any significant investigation or discovery, the
egregious acts of confiscation and criminal destruction of evidence, the
escape or removal of all Israeli suspects, and the use of unwarranted
secrecy measures to block discovery in the federal investigation and
litigation processes of the worst terror attack in U.S. history, all
indicate the presence of an Israeli-based terror structure being protected
from exposure.
It stands to reason that the terror network being protected by high-level
Zionist agents is itself a Zionist structure. If it were truly an Arabic,
Islamic, or even American criminal network, it would have been exposed long
ago. The fact that the terror network behind 9-11 has been protected from
the beginning by Zionist agents and the controlled media strongly suggests
it is something they are dedicated and devoted to.
There were certainly early and clear indications of Israeli involvement,
particularly in the form of the five dancing Israelis and the instant
messages conveyed, presumably in Hebrew, on the Israeli-owned Odigo text
messaging system which warned recipients of an imminent terror attack at the
World Trade Center.
MICHAEL GOFF, THE PTECH "CUT-OUT" & GUARDIUM
The Ptech story is a crucial piece of 9/11 because the software was used to
simultaneously coordinate the FAA with NORAD and the Secret Service.
- Jamey Hecht, "Ptech, 9/11, and USA-Saudi Terror," FTW Publications
Ptech was with MITRE Corporation in the basement of the FAA for two years
prior to 9/11. Their specific job is to look at interoperability issues the
FAA had with NORAD and the Air Force in the case of an emergency. If anyone
was in a position to know that the FAA -- that there was a window of
opportunity or to insert software or to change anything -- it would have
been Ptech along with MITRE.
- Indira Singh, "Risk Architect" at 9/11 Citizens Commission, Sept. 9, 2004
Indira Singh and others
pushed false "Arab terror"
links to Ptech.
My discovery in 2005 that the Ptech software company from Quincy, Mass., was
actually a disguised Israeli intelligence operation is key to understanding
the role of Israeli military intelligence in the crimes of 9-11.
This is a
discovery that has helped reveal other key people in the Israeli network
behind the crime.
Michael Goff - the Ptech "cut-out"
Michael Goff was the key person at Ptech when it was founded in 1994. Goff,
a young Zionist lawyer from Worchester, Massachusetts, subsequently worked
for Guardium, an Israeli software company tied to military intelligence.
This is the crucial connection that has helped expose the larger Israeli
military intelligence network working behind the 9-11 scene.
Through Goff's connection to Guardium we can see how a nexus of senior
officers of Israeli military intelligence agencies links all the key
elements of 9-11. This connection also explains how dodgy Israeli enterprise
spy software wound up on critical U.S. government and military computer
networks.
Ptech is the allegedly Arab-owned and Saudi-financed company whose
enterprise software found its way onto the most critical computer networks
of the U.S. government and military. By 2002, Ptech reportedly provided
software to more than 18 federal agencies, including the FBI, U.S. Treasury,
Customs Service, Secret Service, Department of Energy, Army, Navy, Air
Force, Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Postal Service and even
NATO.
Investigators from the U.S. Customs Service searched Ptech's office on
December 6, 2002. Federal authorities were reportedly concerned about
Ptech's ties to a Saudi named Yassin Al-Qadi (a.k.a. Al-Kadi). Qadi's name
had been added to the UN blacklist on October 19, 2001.
Daniel Glaser, a
Jewish deputy assistant secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial
Crimes at the U.S. Treasury, described Al-Qadi in Congressional testimony in
2004 as a "key terrorist financier and facilitator."
In December 2007, after an investigation that lasted six years and two
months, Yassin Abdullah Al-Qadi was exonerated of all charges by judicial
authorities in Switzerland.
Al-Qadi's funds had been unfairly frozen for six
years based merely on the reckless accusations of Daniel Glaser, an
irresponsible Zionist at the U.S. Treasury who went on to negotiate the
freezing and thawing of North Korean funds.
Daniel Glaser, Deputy Asst. Secretary of Treasury,
in Beijing, Dec. 2006; In 2001, Glaser supervised
Dept. of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes.
He represents America?
How a Lebanese Muslim immigrant funded by a Saudi suspected of being "a
sponsor of terrorism" ever sold enterprise software to the entire U.S.
government is never addressed by those, like Indira Singh, who promoted the
post 9-11 myth that Ptech was a central part of the Arab nexus of terror.
Singh is a bit of a mystery.
Why did she promote the Arab terrorism story
without any evidence other than baseless accusations provided by Jewish
insiders?
The discovery that Goff was actually the key person at Ptech; that he was
Ptech's original marketing director; and that he was the person responsible
for "procuring" software for Ptech should have demolished the Arab myth. My
revelation that Goff was working for Guardium, a software company run by
Israeli military intelligence officers, was ignored by the "whistle blowers"
who had pushed the Arab myth as well as by supposedly non-partisan
investigators of 9-11.
The Ptech-Guardium connection through Michael Goff, however, is a key link
to the terror structure behind 9-11. Ptech enterprise software, which has
spy, surveillance, and intervention capabilities, according to "experts"
like Singh, was running on nearly all of U.S. government computer networks
at the time of 9-11.
Goff, who had procured all software for the
"Arab-owned" Ptech and who had been responsible for marketing Ptech's
enterprise software, went on to work for Guardium, a company that is a
branch of the research and development department of the Israeli Air Force.
What's the connection?
WHO IS GUARDIUM?
Guardium is a spin-off of Log-On Software, an Israeli military intelligence
company based in Ramat Gan, Israel.
Log-On Software was founded by Major Gil Migdan and
Joseph Segev, the former head programmer and telecommunications
officer for the Israeli Navy. The vice president of the company is Danny
Zeitouny, the head of logistics programming for the Israeli military, the
Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
One of the directors of Guardium is Gill Zaphrir (a.k.a. Zafrir), an Israeli
colonel who "headed the research and development department of the Israel
Air Force."
Col. Gil Zafrir of Guardium
headed R&D for Israel Air Force
In its "Executive Profile" about Col.
Zaphrir, Business Week says:
Mr. Gill Zaphrir is a Partner at Veritas Venture Partners. He joined Veritas
in 1999 and has been actively managing the funds of Veritas. Mr. Zaphrir has
research and development and management experience in Israel's air force and
aerospace industry. Prior to joining Veritas in 1999, he headed the research
and development department of the Israel Air Force. In 1987, Mr. Zaphrir
served as System Engineer on the first Israeli satellite project, under the
auspices of IAI-MBT.
Mr. Zaphrir is a Director of Bamboo Mediacasting Inc., and Guardium Inc. He
was a Director of eShip-4u Inc. He was born and raised in Israel, served as
a military navigator in the Israel Air Force and is a Colonel (reserve). Mr.
Zaphrir holds a B.Sc. in Aeronautical Engineering from the Technion in Haifa
and an M.B.A. from Bar-Ilan Business School in Israel.
Another founder and director of Guardium is
Amit Yoran, the Israeli who went
to West Point and became the manager of computer network security for the
Pentagon and Secretary of Defense.
Yoran went on to serve as the "czar" of
cyber security for the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security.
Amit Yoran, a high-level Israeli "hacker"
tied to military intelligence,
designed computer security for the Pentagon,
Air Force, and U.S. government.
Business Week says this about "Dr. Yoran":
Dr. [Amit] Yoran is a Co-Founder of Guardium, Inc. and also served as the
Chief Executive Officer and President. He was the President and Chief
Executive Officer at Riptech Inc, which Dr. Yoran co-founded in 1998.
He was appointed by George W. Bush as the administration's Cyber Chief,
responsible for coordinating the nation's activities in cyber security.
Prior to this, Dr. Yoran served as a Vice President for worldwide-managed
security services at Symantec Corp. and was primarily responsible for
managing security infrastructure in 40 countries.
Before working in the private sector, he served as a
Network Security
Manager at the Department of Defense and [was] responsible for maintaining
operations of the Pentagon's network. Dr. Yoran also served as an officer in
the United States Air Force [as the Director of Vulnerability Programs for
Dept. of Defense's Computer Emergency Response Team]. He designed security
architecture for the Pentagon and Office of the Secretary of Defense
networks' backbones.
Dr. Yoran served as a Director at Guardium, Inc. and Director of the
Vulnerability Assessment and Assistance Program for the U.S. Department of
Defense Computer Emergency Response Team. As a Director, he worked with
national and international law enforcement and intelligence organizations to
prevent and respond to security breaches of national infrastructure
networks.
He serves as a Member of the Adjunct Faculty at George Washington
University. Dr. Yoran has conducted a Doctoral research in the area of
Intrusion Detection Technologies.
Michael Goff's working relationship with Amit Yoran and the Israeli
intelligence operation known as Guardium, Inc. is an excellent example of an
Israeli military intelligence "channel" in the United States. I don't have
specific information about exactly when Goff's relationship with Israeli
military intelligence began, but I would assume it began sometime prior to
1994 when he suddenly left his law practice and began working "for the
Arabs" at Ptech.
Goff's father and grandfather were both highest-level Freemasons in the
International (Jewish) Order of the
B'nai B'rith (a.k.a. Benai Berith), an
exclusive Jewish-Zionist (i.e. closed to non-Jews) order of Freemasons
founded in New York City in 1843.
SON OF BENAI BERITH
The B'nai B'rith is a secretive, but extremely powerful and influential
order of Freemasonry. It is, for example, the parent organization of the
Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith (ADL), which has a great deal of
influence with legislators and law enforcement agencies across America.
It
is also the parent of Hillel, an organization for Jewish students found on
virtually every college campus in the United States. The New York Times can
be also be called a B'nai B'rith newspaper due to its ownership by the
Sulzberger family, one of the leading families of B'nai B'rith Lodge No. 1
in New York City.
Goff's relationship with the Israelis who created Guardium appears to have
been the channel through which Israeli spy software was provided to Ptech.
The resulting Israeli-Ptech enterprise spy software was then installed onto
the most critical computer networks of the U.S. government in the years
prior to 9-11.
"The boy's job in this operation is to play cut-out," the Mossadnik in The
Little Drummer Girl says. "That's all he does. He breaks the circuit."
In
real life, Goff played the "cut-out" at Ptech; he was the connection between
the Israeli military programmers and the crucial computer networks of the
U.S. military.
At the time that Goff worked for Ptech, Yoran was Network Security Manager
at the Dept. of Defense designing computer security for the Pentagon. In
this position, Yoran was ideally situated to arrange the installment of
Ptech software onto the critical computer systems of the U.S. military. The
Israeli nexus between Michael Goff, Ptech, Guardium, and Amit Yoran provides
a logical explanation for how Israeli-cum-Ptech enterprise "spy" software
wound up on the critical computer networks of the U.S. government and
military.
Guardium is closely connected with other companies of the Israeli military
intelligence network in the United States. Some of the key Israeli-run
companies linked to Guardium are Amdocs, ViryaNet, Nice Systems, and
CreoScitex. Like Guardium, these companies are all run by senior officers of
Israeli military intelligence.
Amdocs and Nice Systems are especially noteworthy because these two
companies were involved in the espionage network of computer programmers and
demolition experts from the Israeli military who posed as art students as
they tried to infiltrate offices of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)
in 2000 and 2001, according to a leaked DEA document from the summer of 2001
concerning this spying activity.
The "most activity" of the Israeli operation aimed at infiltrating offices
of the DEA was "reported in the state of Florida," according to the report.
"The Hollywood, Florida area seems to be a central point for these
individuals with several having addresses in this area," the DEA report
said. Hollywood is also the area which connected 15 of the 19 Arab
"hijackers" of 9-11.
If the "art student" operation is connected to 9-11, as
it seems to be, then Amdocs and Nice Systems are also involved.
"A majority of those [Israeli "art students"] questioned has stated they
served in military intelligence, electronic signal intercept, or explosive
ordinance units. Some have been linked to high-ranking officials in the
Israeli military. One was the son of a two-star general, one served as the
bodyguard to the head of the Israeli Army, one served in a Patriot missile
unit. That these people are now travelling in the U.S. selling art seems not
to fit their background," the U.S. DEA investigators concluded.
One of the Israeli agents was 27-year-old Lt. Peer Segalovitz, a platoon
leader with Israeli special forces 605 battalion in the Golan Heights.
Segalovitz and the 80-man platoon he commanded "specialized in demolition."
"Segalovitz acknowledged he could blow up buildings, bridges, cars and
anything else that he needed too," according to the report.
If the Israeli
"art student" intelligence operation is connected to 9-11, then the
prevalence of military computer programmers and demolition experts among the
agents would make sense given the evidence that the terror attacks of 9-11
required a great deal of expertise with computer networks and explosives.
NICE SYSTEMS
Nice Systems, Inc., the wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of an Israeli company
with the same name, was headed by Brig. General Shlomo Shamir from April
2001 when he became President and Chief Executive Officer. This is the
precisely the time when Israeli employees of Nice Systems and Amdocs were
caught trying to infiltrate Drug Enforcement Agency and other U.S.
government buildings posing as art students.
Gen. Shamir certainly must have
been aware that his employees had been sent to the United States where they
were arrested for illegal spying activity prior to 9-11.
Brig. Gen. Shlomo Shamir
Brig. Gen. Shamir "built and led the planning division in the IDF [Israeli
military] headquarters and served as Israels military attaché to Germany"
until 1994, when he began working at Scitex America Corp., which he headed
from 1997 and which later became CreoScitex America, Inc.
Avinoam Naor Aharonovich, one of the founders of Amdocs, was President and
CEO of Amdocs Management Ltd., the company's management group from 1995 to
2002.
As Chief Executive Officer of Amdocs Management Limited, Naor had
overall coordination responsibility for the operations and activities of the
company's operating subsidiaries.
Avinoam Naor Aharonovich of Amdocs
A number of senior corporate officers of Amdocs, all Israelis, moved between
Nice Systems, ViryaNet Ltd., and Guardium. Sometimes a person would go to a
company for a while and then return to the previous company.
In some cases,
such as with Gill Zaphrir, a person would be involved in an Israeli "venture
capital" fund supporting a company while serving as a director of the
company he is funding.
Elad Yoran
Elad Yoran [a.k.a. Naftali Yoran], Amit's older brother, held similar dual
positions at Broadview International and Riptech, his brother's company that
specialized in hacking into corporate computer networks while selling them
Riptech's "security" software.
AMIT YORAN'S "ETHICAL HACKERS"
"Mr. [Amit] Yoran is chief executive of Riptech, a U.S. company that employs
'ethical hackers' to test vulnerability of networks, including those of
utility companies," the Irish Times reported on October 5, 2001. "He [Yoran]
says his teams have had success in disrupting utilities' power networks, in
Europe particularly," according to the article, which was aptly titled,
"Welcome to the Art of Electronic Warfare."
The Yorans' company hacked into the computer networks of dozens of energy
companies, the Los Angeles Times reported on August 20, 2001:
Riptech Inc., a security company in Alexandria, Va., has tested security for
dozens of energy-industry clients. In every case, the firm penetrated
Internet-connected corporate networks and often hopped from those networks
into supposedly sealed grid-control systems, according to Riptech's
president, Amit Yoran.
In February 2001, Amit Yoran, then chief executive of Riptech, told the
Associated Press that hackers often break into a system through a computer
that runs a Web site. "Once you break in (to the Web server), there are
fewer protections between it and other parts of the network," Yoran said.
Elad Yoran, Tim Belcher, and Amit Yoran,
the senior hackers of Riptech
Riptech "was founded by Elad and Amit Yoran, two Israeli West Point
graduates who claim years of security experience, and Tim Belcher, a Desert
Storm veteran who serves as the company's chief technology officer," the
Washington Times reported on December 11, 2000.
"Amit Yoran reportedly
helped design the Pentagon's computer security architecture," the Times
reported.
"The threat changes every day. There has always been and always will be a
criminal element out there. [The crooks] are not going away," said Elad
Yoran, the company's chief financial officer. He should know.
He was Riptech's chief marketing officer and vice president for business
development at the time of 9-11.
"Riptech's specialty is in security management and monitoring of corporate
computer networks," the Washington Times reported on October 23, 2000, when
the Yoran brothers' private company of "ethical hackers" announced an
infusion of $23 million in venture capital.
Oddly, the Washington Times reported that Elad Yoran had "joined" Riptech in
August 2001, when he had already been the company's vice president for two
years:
"Elad Yoran joined Riptech as executive vice president for corporate
development and chief marketing officer. Mr. Yoran was a vice president with
Broadview International," the Times reported on August 6, 2001.
But, nearly two years earlier, on October 25, 1999, the Washington Times
reported:
"Elad Yoran has joined RipTech Inc., an information security
application service provider in Alexandria, as executive vice president.
Before joining RipTech, Mr. Yoran was a senior associate with Broadview, an
investment bank that specializes in mergers and acquisitions for information
technology and media companies."
In both cases it was reported that Yoran had been a vice president with
Broadview, one of the mysterious funding entities of Riptech, prior to
joining Riptech. Elad Yoran was clearly performing two functions for
Riptech: funding the company through his position as "vice president at
Broadview International," an unknown source of funds that poured millions of
dollars into Riptech, and as "executive vice president" of Riptech, the
privately-held recipient company he co-founded with his brother in 1998.
It is through such secretive "venture capital" funding entities like
Broadview and Veritas Venture Partners that the hand of Israeli military
intelligence can be clearly seen running the computer network "security"
companies they have spawned, like Guardium.
Before becoming a director of Guardium, for example, Col. Gill Zafrir was
"actively managing the funds of Veritas," and funding Guardium.
Prior to
joining Veritas in 1999, Col. Zaphrir "headed the research and development
department of the Israel Air Force."
SECURITY GROWTH PARTNERS
Elad Yoran is also the CEO and founder of a similar funding company called
Security Growth Partners (SGP). The SGP website says this about the
company's mission:
Security Growth Partners (SGP) mission is to support companies that provide
security solutions for the security market. SGP serves a large and diverse
industry including, among others, information technology (IT) security,
Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), homeland security and their
related markets.
SGP is more than a fund or typical venture capital organization. We identify
desirable opportunities and become extensively involved in the strategy and
operations of each company with which we work.
Rather than simply invest, we capitalize on both our extensive expertise and
experience in the security sector and our strong network of contacts to help
management grow their businesses.
The founder of SGP, Elad Yoran,
"advises leading companies in the security
market and helps guide emerging companies with innovative technology to
rapid growth. Mr. Yoran also advises government and infrastructure
organizations on security and business risk matters."
The list of Elad Yoran's advisors and partners at SGP is very interesting.
It includes his brother Amit Yoran, of course, and previously included
another Israeli named Ilan Juran, which is another spelling of the same
Israeli name.
Ilan Juran works at the Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, New York. Juran
is director of the US-Israel Civil Infrastructure Security Program, an
initiative of the Urban Utility Center, which he is "executive director" of.
Juran's program is,
"designed to foster collaboration, as well as knowledge
and technology sharing, between the U.S. and Israel governments and critical
infrastructure organizations."
Ilan Juran
Tim Belcher, a co-founder of Riptech, the company of "ethical hackers," is
another advisor at SGP.
As Belcher's biographical sketch says:
Mr. Belcher has also conducted security assessments of some of the nations
most critical infrastructure components, including the Federal Aviation
Administrations Air Traffic Control Network. He has also worked with
government organizations such as the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the National Reconnaissance Office, the Office of the
Secretary of Defense, and Space and Naval Warfare Command.
THE KROLL CONNECTION
It is interesting to note that Jeremy M. Kroll, the Managing Director of
Marsh Kroll, is also on the "advisory board" of Elad Yoran's Security Growth
Partners. This is a crucial connection in the Zionist network behind 9-11;
this is where we hit the mainline.
Jeremy Kroll of Marsh Kroll
Kroll, the son of Jules B. Kroll, has been an executive at
Marsh Kroll, a
division of Marsh & McLennan Co. (MMC), since 1996. Jeremy Kroll's
connection with Elad and Amit Yoran through SGP reveals a key link between
the American Zionist network and Israeli military intelligence.
MMC is headed by Jeffrey Greenberg, the son of Maurice Raymond Greenberg
(a.k.a. "Hank"). Maurice Greenberg, the CEO of A.I.G., has been a business
partner with Jules B. Kroll since 1993 when he reportedly bought 23 percent
of Kroll Inc. for $15 million.
In 2004 MMC acquired the rest of Kroll for
the hugely inflated price of $1.9 billion. Jules Kroll reportedly retired in
July 2008.
Jeffrey Greenberg is CEO of MMC.
The first plane flew directly into his company's computer room.
What an amazing coincidence - or was it?
KROLL SECURITY AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
Kroll Associates was responsible for "revamping security at the World Trade
Center after the 1993 terrorist bombing," Douglas Frantz of the New York
Times reported in 1994. This is a crucial point because those who controlled
security at the WTC are prime suspects in the demolition of the twin towers.
It was directly into the computer room of Marsh (Kroll) USA in the North
Tower that the first plane struck, or was precision-guided, on 9-11. The
light orange flame and whitish smoke that exploded out of burning computer
room of Marsh USA are indicative of a Thermite reaction. Burning jet fuel
produces darker orange flames and blackish smoke.
John O'Neill, the former chief of counterterrorism with the FBI, who had
investigated Al Qaida, was the head of security for the World Trade Center
complex, and was reportedly killed on his first day of work on 9-11. O'Neill
had been appointed to this position by the managing director of the Kroll
security company, Jerome M. Hauer.
Kroll evidently continued to manage
security for the WTC complex from 1993 until 9-11.
Jerome Hauer (left), the first director
of Giuliani's Office of Emergency
Management and the person who chose
to locate the command bunker in WTC 7.
Prior to joining Kroll, Hauer, a Zionist Jew, had been the director of Mayor
Giuliani's Office of Emergency Management (OEM), where he had been the
driving force to have the OEM command bunker built in Larry Silverstein's
47-story WTC 7, the tower which fell into its footprint at 5:21 p.m. on
9-11.
Testimony from Larry Silverstein and physical evidence strongly
suggest that WTC 7 was demolished with explosives and Thermite.
HISTORY OF ISRAELI "SECURITY" AT PORT AUTHORITY
There is a very significant, but little-known history of senior Israeli
intelligence officers seeking to gain control of security of New York
airports, ports, bridges, tunnels, and the World Trade Center in the 1980s.
Being in charge of security at the twin towers was obviously crucial to the
9-11 operation. The explosive charges and Thermite that evidently demolished
the three towers could not have possibly been placed in the buildings
without the perpetrators having complete control of security.
Getting control of security at the WTC was something senior officers of
Israeli military intelligence had actively sought since at least 1987. This
was clearly part of the Israeli master plan for 9-11, a plan first
articulated in 1979 by Isser Harel, the former head of Israeli intelligence
(Director Shin Bet, 19481952; Director Mossad, 1947-1963).
Harel, formerly the director of Haganah intelligence in the 1940s, is seen
as the founder of Israeli intelligence. The Haganah and Irgun were the
largest Zionist militia/terrorist organizations in Palestine prior to the
creation of Israel in 1948. Both organizations were involved in the terror
bombing of the King David Hotel and other acts of terrorism.
Harel was evidently involved in the long-term planning of 9-11. More than 20
years earlier he had told Michael D. Evans, an American Zionist missionary,
that terrorism would "come to America."
Arab terrorists would strike the
tallest building in New York City, "a symbol of your fertility," Harel said.
Michael D. Evans is a hard-line Zionist Jew
who poses as a Christian. Here Evans embraces
Menachem Begin, the former terrorist head of the Irgun
who ordered the bombing of the King David Hotel.
Isser Harel told Evans of the plan to bomb the World Trade Center
in 1979, about the time of this photo.
Evans, a Jewish Zionist who has long had close ties to Israeli officials,
wrote about Harel's prediction of 9-11 in several newspaper articles and
talked about it in an interview that followed the publication of his 2004
book entitled The American Prophecies, Terrorism and the Mid-East Conflict
Reveal a Nation's Destiny.
Note: Harel's 9-11 prediction is discussed in greater detail in the previous
chapter entitled "America the Target."
Harel had dinner with Evans on September 23, 1979, according to Evans, and
told him that America's alliance with Saudi Arabia "was dangerous and would
develop a tolerance for terror among Americans."
Harel went on to say that
"Islamic fundamentalists would ultimately strike America."
HAREL'S AMAZING PREDICTION OF 9-11
When Evans asked where the Arab terrorists would strike, Harel said:
"In
Islamic theology, the phallic symbol is very important. Your biggest phallic
symbol is New York City and your tallest building will be the phallic symbol
they will hit."
Now, how did Harel know that, in 1979, if he was not part of
it?
Isser Harel,
founder of Israeli intelligence
"Isser Harel prophesied that the tallest building in New York would be the
first building hit by Islamic fundamentalists 21 years ago," Evans said in
the 2004 interview; how amazingly prescient or telling.
Seven years after Harel's bizarre prediction, a team of senior Israeli
intelligence agents, men who had worked directly under Isser Harel for
decades, obtained the security contract for the Port Authority of New York,
the agency that owned and operated the World Trade Center. The Israeli
false-flag terror of 9-11, designed to create the "War on Terror" and drag
the United States into the Israeli-Arab conflict on the side of Israel, was
evidently planned decades in advance.
A team of senior Israeli intelligence veterans, men who had worked under
Harel since the founding of Israeli intelligence, obtained the security
contract for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PA) in 1987,
according to a Washington Post article from April 12, 1987. The Port
Authority manages operations at New York's airports, as it did at the World
Trade Center prior to the complex being leased to Larry Silverstein in late
July, 2001.
The contract with an Israeli "security" company called Atwell Security of
Tel Aviv was cancelled after the PA learned that the firm was headed by
Avraham Shalom Ben-Dor, the former head of the Israel's General Security
Service (GSS), a.k.a. Shabak or Shin Bet.
The Atwell company appears to have
been created only for the purpose of obtaining the security contract for the
Port Authority and the World Trade Center.
Avraham Shalom Ben-Dor
Avraham Bendor, or Ben-Dor (a.k.a. Abe, Avrum, or Avram Shalom) had been
forced to resign as head of the GSS, which he ran from 1980 to 1986,
following the disclosure that he had ordered the execution of two detained
Palestinian bus hijackers by having their skulls smashed with stones, and
then lied about it.
"Avrum lied and kept lying," a senior security official involved in the Bus
300 affair told the Jerusalem Post in 1995. "He failed because he was too
sure of himself and too used to hearing how great he was."
Shalom, the head of the GSS, was identified by an Israeli Justice Ministry
report in December 1986 as having ordered the murder and subsequent cover-up
of the two Palestinian bus hijackers captured in 1984. Shalom and 10 other
Shin Bet agents were forced to resign, although President Chaim Hertzog
subsequently granted them all pardons.
Shalom corrupted the GSS, as well:
"Some of the vices of the Shalom regime
still plague the GSS," the Post reported in 1995. "One problem
is the lack
of parliamentary control over the GSS."
This is a very important observation
because it indicates that the Shin Bet under Shalom had become a rogue
agency and had a history of being out of control.
"The most disturbing trend
is the recurring episodes in which GSS agents provide misleading information
to officials and the courts," the Post reported.
"The head of Shabak [GSS] has an unusual personal relationship with Prime
Minister Shamir, partly perhaps because of Shamir's own past in the
espionage business," the Jerusalem Post wrote in June 1991.
Shalom had
ordered the murders but tried to blame a senior army officer at the scene
and later claimed that Shamir had given him a free hand.
The former Irgun
and Lehi terrorist Yitzhak Shamir (born Jaziernicki in Belarus) was the
prime minister responsible for Shin Bet at the time.
Yitzhak Shamir was a leader from the extreme right-wing Likud.
After joining the Irgun terrorist group in 1935, he joined its
most militant faction, Lehi, in 1940. He personally authorized
the assassination of the UN representative in the Middle East,
the Swedish Count Folke Bernadotte, in September 1948.
Inset is Shamir's son, Yair.
Edward J. O'Sullivan, director of the office of special plans at the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, simply said that the contract with
Atwell Security of Tel Aviv had been terminated because "we are no longer
satisfied with the agreement," the Washington Post reported in April 1987.
O'Sullivan said the port authority's legal office told him not to comment on
why he was killing the contract. O'Sullivan said he acted after a reporter
inquired about the contract and Atwell's president, Avraham Bendor,
acknowledged that he was also known as Avraham Shalom. Atwell, a subsidiary
of the Eisenberg Group [Shaul Eisenberg of the Mossad], had been chosen
"largely on the basis of Bendor's credentials," O'Sullivan said.
Use of aliases in Israeli intelligence is common, the Washington Post
reported.
"One intelligence expert said that even Bendor may not be the
former Shin Bet chief's real name."
A New York-based senior Israeli intelligence officer,
Peter [Zvi] Malkin,
had acted as a New York representative for Atwell Security of Tel Aviv in
the negotiations with the PA, O'Sullivan said. Malkin is famous for being
the Mossad agent who grabbed Adolf Eichmann during the Israeli kidnapping in
Argentina in 1960.
The executives running the Port Authority in 1987, the mayor, and his first
deputy, all Zionist Jews, certainly must have been aware of the PA decision
to hire a company run by a senior Mossad agent to provide security for New
York's airports, ports, commuter trains, and World Trade Center under its
authority. The people who made the decision to give the security contract to
Avraham Bendor's Atwell Security of Tel Aviv must have known that Zvi Malkin
was a senior Mossad agent; they had negotiated with him, after all.
The executive director of the Port Authority in 1987 was Stephen Berger
(1985-1990). As executive director of the PA, one of the world's largest
transportation agencies, Berger was described by Thomas J. Lueck of the
New
York Times in August 1987 as,
"a man at the center of New York City's
economy, deftly pulling strings in business and government alike."
Today,
Berger is Chairman of Odyssey Investment Partners, a private New York
investment firm that specializes in private corporate transactions.
Berger,
a Jew, is a member of the board of New York's Citizens Budget Commission
(CBC) with fellow Zionist Jews Larry Silverstein and Felix Rohatyn.
Stephen Berger;
director of the Port Authority
when Atwell Security, a Mossad company,
received the security contract in 1987.
Prior to becoming director of the Port Authority, Berger was a principal
with Odyssey Partners (1983-85) with Leon Levy and Jack Nash, both Zionist
Jews. Before joining Odyssey Partners, Berger had been Director of Corporate
Development at Oppenheimer & Co., where Nash and Levy had been "senior-most
partners."
Levy was "a hedge fund pioneer" who founded Odyssey Partners LP with Jack
Nash in 1982.
"Odyssey's leverage buyouts (LBOs) and other investments
reveal a pattern of slash-and-burn management and financial opportunism,"
Brooks Bitterman, Research Director for Local 100 of the Hotel Employees and
Restaurant Employees Union in New York, wrote in September 1995.
"And with
Stephen Berger's return to Odyssey Partners in July of 1993, the firm has
been reinvigorating its LBO investing business," Bitterman wrote.
Philip D. Kaltenbacher, a former running mate of Governor Thomas H. Kean of
New Jersey, was the chairman of the Port Authority's Board of Commissioners
from 1985 to 1990. Prior to becoming a PA commissioner in 1983, Kaltenbacher
had been Chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee.
Kaltenbacher's father, Joseph, was a founder of the New Jersey Chapter of
the American Jewish Committee and a former member of the national board of
governors of the AJC, a major Zionist organization.
Stanley Brezenoff, who later became executive director of the PA in 1990,
was Deputy Mayor for Operations and First Deputy Mayor under Mayor Edward
Irving Koch (1978-89) at the time the Port Authority's security contract was
being negotiated with a senior Mossad agent.
Brezenoff was,
"the second most
powerful official in the Koch administration and was the government's chief
operating officer, often serving as acting Mayor in Mr. Koch's absence,"
according to the New York Times.
Brezenoff directed the day-to-day operations of city agencies, including
police, fire, and transportation. It is hard to imagine that Brezenoff,
whose Yiddish-speaking grandparents had immigrated to the United States in
the early 1900s from Russia and Austria, was unaware of the deal to give the
PA security contract to Atwell Security of Tel Aviv. Malkin was, after all,
a legendary figure among the Zionist Jews of New York.
Malkin was one of the Israeli intelligence agents involved in the kidnapping
of Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires in 1960. Malkin later wrote a book
entitled Eichmann In My Hands, about his role in the kidnapping. It was none
other than Isser Harel, then head of the Mossad, who had sent Malkin and six
others on the mission to find Eichmann, where previous agents had failed.
Harel had worked closely with Shimon Peres and
Teddy Kollek in the pre-state
Haganah militia of the 1940s when they had been responsible for procuring
weapons and smuggling them to Zionist forces.
MOSSAD: AMERICA IS THE ENEMY
Other agents on the seven-person Mossad team involved in the Eichmann
kidnapping were Avraham Shalom Ben-Dor and Rafael "Dirty Rafi"
Eitan, the
senior Mossadnik [not the Chief of Staff with the same name], who ran the
Jonathan Pollard espionage operation against the United States in the 1980s.
Eitan later told the Israeli press that he had been made a scapegoat to
cover for Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir, senior Israeli politicians who
knew about Eitan's espionage network in America, but defended themselves -
and the State of Israel - by saying it was "a rogue operation."
Eitan headed a special spying unit known as the Scientific Liaison Office
and directed a team of agents working out of the Israeli Embassy in
Washington when the Pollard spy operation was exposed in 1985.
For Eitan, a
minister in the current Israeli government and member of the cabinet, the
United States has always been considered "the enemy."
Rafi Eitan, Mossad spymaster,
advisor to Fidel Castro, and Israeli cabinet minister
That Eitan, a senior Israeli intelligence officer and member of the Israeli
cabinet, would say to one of Israel's largest daily newspapers in 1997 that
the United States is an enemy of Israel, and that his position would not be
challenged, is something that, unfortunately, very few Americans understand.
"I failed in the Pollard affair, just as I failed in other intelligence
operations beyond enemy lines," Eitan told the newspaper Yediot Aharonot in
June 1997. "That is the lot of an intelligence officer who runs complex
intelligence operations. When you work a lot and do a lot, especially in the
intelligence field, you win some and you lose some," he said.
"Nobody knows either about your successes or your failures. It doesn't cause
a fuss. But this was a big fuss. You take such a possibility into
consideration, but there is nothing you can do about it."
"I'm surprised he would admit this," Joseph diGenova, the U.S. attorney who
prosecuted the case, said. "But this is basically all stuff that the
evidence in the case shows."
DiGenova said Eitan's statement was unusual in that it contradicted the
"official Israeli position" that the Pollard case had been an unauthorized
"rogue" operation, and in that Eitan "does not refer to the United States as
an ally, which is regrettable."
Eitan's statement about the Pollard operation being an operation "beyond
enemy lines" reveals how Israeli intelligence veterans view the Israeli-U.S.
relationship, something DiGenova seems unable or unwilling to grasp or
articulate.
Eitan said he has close relations with senior Cuban leaders, including Fidel
Castro, and has helped develop the Cuba's agricultural infrastructure with
Israeli irrigation equipment, chemicals, pesticides and fertilizers, along
with agricultural advisers.
According to Eitan, the 10 Israelis actively doing business in Cuba for the
past five years [1992-97] "have more influence than Russia had in the last
30 years."
The business has developed Cuba's corn, citrus fruit and tomato farming for
export, and Eitan represented "a long list of Isareli companies in Cuba."
"We are changing agriculture in Cuba," Eitan said, adding that his business
violated the U.S. embargo and had made U.S. officials "very angry."
He declined to identify his business partners in Cuba, citing a U.S. law
that penalizes foreigners doing business in Cuba who use confiscated
American property.
Eitan's revealing comments were published in the Washington Times of June
22, 1997.
WHO IS ZVI MALKIN?
Peter Malkin (a.k.a. Zvi Malchin or Milchman) was born in Poland in 1928 and
raised in British-occupied Palestine during the mandate period. At age 12,
Malkin joined the Haganah, the Zionist underground militia. In 1950, he
joined the Shin Bet, the Israeli security agency. He became an explosives
specialist and was known as a master of disguises.
Malkin preferred international work and became chief of operations for the
Israeli intelligence agency, the Mossad. "During foreign postings, Malkin
posed as an artist," his March 3, 2005, obituary in the New York Sun said.
A very young Malkin "retired" as head of operations of the Mossad in 1976
and moved to New York, where he worked as "a security consultant" and "posed
as an artist." His "security consultant" work clearly involved brokering the
security contract for the Port Authority and the World Trade Center - for
the Mossad. Malkin had not retired from the Mossad; he'd gone undercover.
Malkin's artist disguise is probably the inspiration for the "art student"
operation to infiltrate DEA offices in 2001. It is interesting to note that
Michael Chertoff's mother, Livia Eisen, one of the first Mossad agents,
owned an art gallery in Elizabeth, New Jersey, when Malkin was posing as a
painter in nearby New York.
These "retired" Mossad "artists" probably spent
a great deal of time together.
Mossad chief Peter Zvi Malkin brokered
a deal in 1987 giving the security contract
for the Port Authority to fellow Mossadnik
Avraham Shalom Ben-Dor. The contract was
cancelled when the PA discovered Ben-Dor's
criminal past, forcing Malkin and Ben-Dor
to change tack and use American partners.
Malkin, supposedly "retired" from the Mossad in 1976 at the very young age
of 48.
This is a very similar profile to that of Shalom Yoran, the former
head of the I.A.I., Israel's aircraft industry, who retired at age 50 and
moved to New York to write and talk about his days as a Zionist soldier.
Malkin moved to New York, where he wrote, painted, and helped his friend,
Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, "on investigations."
Morgenthau helped Malkin get a "green card" and to become a U.S. citizen.
Zvi Malkin, the Israeli intelligence agent who "will forever be known as the
man who captured Adolf Eichmann," continued to work as "a security expert"
in the United States.
"I'm out of the secret service business for sure," he
told Ralph Blumenthal of the New York Times in May 2003. "But I help."
PLUTONIUM SMUGGLERS
The Washington Post revealed the serious nature of the crimes Malkin,
Shalom, and Eitan had been involved in when it reported in 1986 that Rafi
Eitan, posing as a chemist, had travelled, in 1968, to the Pennsylvania
nuclear processing plant that secretly diverted several hundred kilograms of
weapons-grade uranium to Israel.
A declassified FBI document shows that
another Israeli, "Abraham Bendor, department of electronics," accompanied
Eitan on that trip.
Malkin and the same Avraham Bendor were later named as the senior Israeli
intelligence agents who obtained the security contract for the World Trade
Center in 1987, only to lose the contract when Bendor's criminal past was
discovered.
Rafi Eitan, Zvi Malkin, and Avraham Ben-Dor had been working
together on super-secret Israeli missions from 1960 through 1987, when they
obtained the security contract with the Port Authority, the owner of the
World Trade Center.
For the Mossad and the WTC, however, 1987 was just the
beginning.

KROLL, GREENBERG & THE ISRAELIS
Rebuffed in 1987, the Mossad team of Malkin and Shalom didn't give up on
Isser Harel's prophecy of 9-11, which meant getting the Port Authority
security contract. They simply changed tack and decided to work in a less
obvious manner, through dedicated and corrupt American Zionists like Jules
Kroll and Maurice Greenberg.
Shalom went to work for Kroll, according to the
online 9/11 Encyclopedia entry for Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, the CEO of the
American International Group (A.I.G.) insurance company.
Messrs Malkin, Eitan, and Abe Shalom/Ben-Dor crop up frequently in Miami in
the 1980s and 90s:
"Israeli intelligence agent, author and artist Peter Z. Malkin" addressed the Young Leadership Council of the Greater Miami Jewish
Federation, for example, on October 8, 1991, at the Hyatt Regency in Miami,
according to the Miami Herald.

Amazingly, a "Rafi Eitan" and "Abe Shalom" shared the same address in Miami
in the 1990s.
"Abe Shalom" also shared a Miami address at 19707 Turnberry
Way with a Morris (and Lillian) Saffati, a name very similar to that of the
Miami-based Israeli agent who sold weapons to the Medellin drug cartel,
Maurice (and Ilana) Sarfati, a.k.a. Moshe Tzorfati. "Abe Shalom" also lived
in Deal, New Jersey, near Lillian Saffati, the wife of Morris.
Are these the
tracks of the culprits or mere coincidences?
Through Avraham Shalom Ben-Dor, Kroll Associates bought Palumbo Partners,
the Miami-based international security firm in August 1992, reportedly "to
expand in key Latin American markets."
"According to sources in the industry, Palumbo brought with him a personal
history of involvement with the Medellin and other South American narcotics
cartels; his business included helping relocate some of the capabilities of
these cartels out of Colombia," the 9/11 Encyclopedia says.
"The deal to bring Palumbo into Kroll was worked out by Avram Shalom, the
former head of Israel's Shin Bet secret police," the 9/11 Encyclopedia says,
without documenting the claim.
In 1993, Maurice Greenberg became a partner and co-owner of Jules Kroll's
company when A.I.G. bought 23 percent of Kroll. Greenberg is very close to
Henry Kissinger, who became chairman of A.I.G.'s International Advisory
Board in 1987.
Jules Kroll of Kroll Security
Maurice Greenberg
of A.I.G.
Greenberg was deeply involved in China in the 80s, where
Henry Kissinger was
one of his representatives, according to the 9-11 Encyclopedia.
Through the
China trade, Greenberg became close to Shaul Eisenberg, the leader of the
Asian section of the Israeli intelligence service Mossad, and agent for the
sales of sophisticated military equipment to the Chinese military, it
reports. Eisenberg was also the owner of Atwell Security of Tel Aviv.
Greenberg also has a joint venture with the founder of Amdocs. Greenberg's
insurance subsidiary in Israel, called A.I.G. Golden, is a joint venture
with Morris Kahn's Aurec Group (the parent company of Amdocs), an Israeli
private equity firm with cable and telecom investments. Kahn was an original
investor in Amdocs Ltd., of which his Aurec Group is the parent company.
Aurec is meant to signify "golden" from the Latin, hence the gilded name of
the A.I.G. subsidiary.

Jules Kroll is connected with the 9-11 players
Kenneth Bialkin and Larry
Silverstein through the Citizens Budget Commission of New York.
Kroll's
wife, Lynn Korda Kroll, the Vice Chairman of the United Jewish Appeal (UJA)
Federation of New York, is likewise connected to Silverstein, a national
chairman of the UJA, the biggest fund-raising organization for the State of
Israel.
Maurice Greenberg and Jules Kroll are connected to the key players of 9-11
in so many ways that their connections would fill a book. For the purpose of
this chapter, however, there are a few key connections that need to be
underlined:
-
Maurice Greenberg and Jules Kroll became partners in 1993, the same year
Kroll Associates "was chosen over three other companies to advise the Port
Authority on a redesign of its security procedures." "We have such
confidence in them that I have followed every one of their recommendations,"
Stanley Brezenoff, the Port Authority executive director, told the New York
Times in 1994.
-
Kroll controlled security at the World Trade Center complex in 2001 and was
responsible for hiring John O'Neill, the former chief of counterterrorism
for the FBI, who died on 9-11, reportedly his first day on the new job.
-
Greenberg's son, Jeffrey W. Greenberg, became CEO of Marsh & McLennan (MMC)
in 1999 and chairman in 2000. The first plane of 9-11 flew directly into the
secure computer room of Marsh (Kroll) USA, part of Greenberg's company. Mark
Wood, an eyewitness, said: "It looked like a mid-sized executive jet and the
way it turned suggested it was being aimed deliberately at a target."
-
Lewis "Jerry" Bremer, the U.S. proconsul who ran occupied Iraq until the end
of June 2004, joined Marsh Kroll's crisis group shortly after 9-11. Bremer
had worked closely with Kissinger since the 1970s and was managing director
at Kissinger Associates in 2001.
-
Jerome M. Hauer, the former director of Mayor Giuliani's Office of Emergency
Management, was responsible for having the command bunker built in Larry
Silverstein's WTC 7. Hauer was a managing director for Kroll in 2001.
-
Kroll revamped security at the World Trade Center after the 1993 terrorist
bombing. Kroll was reportedly responsible for security at the World Trade
Center on 9-11. "Over the last two years, the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey has paid Kroll $2.5 million to overhaul security at the World
Trade Center and evaluate procedures at the agency's bridges, tunnels and
airports," the New York Times reported on September 1, 1994.
-
Kroll was hired by Kuwait in October 1990 to find the hidden wealth of
Saddam Hussein.
-
Kroll began profiting from the war in Iraq in April 2003 when it received
contracts to provide protection and security for government agencies and
companies in Iraq.
-
Kroll's son, Jeremy M. Kroll, is the Managing Director at Marsh Kroll and
has served as General Manager at Kroll's Information Security Group (i.e.
computer security). He is responsible for business and strategic
development, business intelligence, investigations, forensic accounting, and
security services, such as those Kroll provided to the Port Authority and
the World Trade Center prior to 9-11.
-
Jeremy Kroll serves on the board of the Israel-based Challenge Fund with
Israeli government officials from the highest level, including Israel's
National Security Advisor and Head of the National Security Council, a
former head of Shin Bet, former Directors General of the Ministries of
Foreign Affairs and Defense, former Commanders of the Israel Air Force,
Central Command, and the Technology and Logistic Branch of the IDF, as well
as the head of Boeing (Israel) and the son of Yitzhak Shamir. The Challenge
Fund uses money raised through the Bronfman and Andreas (ADM) families to
fund Israeli companies, like ViryaNet.
KROLL & THE CHALLENGE FUND
The Challenge Fund is an Israeli intelligence funding operation, based in
Israel, that is also known as Etgar, which means "challenge" in Hebrew. This
limited partnership involves the biggest players in the Zionist funding
network in North America with the most senior officers in Israeli military
intelligence. This is one of the key funding entities for Israeli
intelligence operations in the United States.
The operation describes itself as,
"two Delaware limited partnerships focused
on equity investments in Israel-related privately held and publicly traded
companies."
The Challenge Fund was founded in July 1995. A second fund, The Challenge
Fund - Etgar II L.P., was established in 1999. The funds claim to have a
capital base in excess of $200 million, "making them one of Israel's leading
sources of private investment capital."
Challenge Fund investors include "a highly distinguished group of American
and European investors," primarily members of the extended Bronfman and
Andreas families. Charles de Gunzburg, for example, a Bronfman cousin, is on
the funds' "investment committee." Bronfman, which means distiller in
Yiddish, is the family behind Seagram's, the Canadian whisky company.
Andreas is the family behind the grain broker Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).
The funds are managed by the "Challenge Partners," a small team of
"experienced professionals," all Israelis of course, headed by Joseph Ciechanover.

was sponsored by Wiesel and the King of Jordan.

Joseph Ciechanover is the president of the funds and is a member of the
"Investment Committee".
Ciechanover is a former chairman of state-owned El Al Israel Airlines.
Living in New York, he is also a member of the NASDAQ Advisory Board. He
previously served as President of PEC Israel Economic Corporation [P for
Palestine], which was later merged into I.D.B. Holding [Israel Discount
Bank], a private investment and holding company.
Ciechanover served as Chairman of the Board of Israel Discount Bank [how
convenient], Israel's third largest commercial bank, and was a member of the
Bank of Israel Advisory Committee. He also served as Director General of
Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Head of Israel's Defense Mission to
the United States and Canada, and General Counsel to the Israel Ministries
of Defense and Agriculture.
Tamar Ciechanover
Ciechanover's daughter, Tamar, is a "managing partner" of the funds.
Another partner of the Challenge Funds is Maj. General Ilan Biran, the
Chairman of the Board of Rafael Armament Development Authority Ltd. (since
June 2007), former Director General of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, and
president and CEO of Bezeq, the Israel Telecommunication Corp.
During his
military service, Biran served as Commander of the Central Command and the
Technology and Logistic Branch of the IDF.
Maj. General Ilan Biran,
former Director General
of the Israeli Ministry of Defense,
is Chairman of Rafael Armament
Development Authority Ltd.
On the "advisory board" with Jeremy Kroll sit some of the most interesting
people involved in the Challenge Funds.
One is David Ivry, president of Boeing [Israel]. Ivry has held several
senior military and diplomatic related positions, including Commander of the
Israel Air Force (1977-82), an unprecedented ten-year period as Director
General of the Ministry of Defense (1986-96), and Israel's chief
representative to the U.S.-Israel Strategic Dialogue.
Ivry moved from the highest position in the Ministry of Defense to become
the Minister of Strategic Affairs at the Prime Minister's office from 1996
to 1999, and Ambassador to the U.S. from January 2000 through 2002.
Ivry has
served twice as Chairman of the Board of Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI).
Maj. Gen. David Ivry (r) with Shimon Peres (l)
and Rona Ramon at 3rd Ramon Annual Int.
Space Conference, 30 January 2008
From October 1977 to the end of 1982 [i.e. during the period of the most
egregious criminal aerial assaults on Lebanon], Ivry commanded the Israel
Air Force (IAF). Ivry also directed the IAF's criminal destruction of the
Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq. Ivry clearly has a history of directing
criminal actions using aircraft.
In 1962, David Ivry became the commander of the first Israeli squadron of
the French Dassault Mirage fighter jet. During the six-day war of 1967, Ivry
served as a Mirage pilot and the commander of the Mystère squadron. Ivry was
either personally involved in the criminal Israeli attack on the U.S.S.
Liberty with Mirage fighters or commanded those who were. Thirty-four
American servicemen lost their lives in the Israeli attack.
In any case, Ivry has clearly been involved in numerous war crimes and has shown very
little regard for American lives.
Yaakov Peri (a.k.a. Jacob Perry)
Director of Shin Bet 1988-94
Another member of the Challenge Fund advisory board is Jacob Perry (a.k.a.
Yaacov Peri). Perry is another former head of the Shin Bet (Director GSS,
1988-94). In 1995, Perry left the secret service and "joined the business
sector" with his appointment as president and CEO of Cellcom Israel Ltd.,
Israel's largest wireless telephone service provider.
Avi Naor (Aharonovich) of the Aurec Group and president and CEO of Amdocs is
another member of the Challenge Fund's advisory board.
In addition to Ciechanover, the Challenge Fund has been managed by Yair
Shamir, the son of Yitzhak Shamir, the Zionist terrorist who was involved in
numerous assassinations, including the 1947 murder of the U.N. envoy to
Palestine, Folke Bernadotte, a member of the Swedish royal family.
Shamir is
also suspected of being involved in the murder of President John F. Kennedy.
Yair Shamir
During his term in the Air Force, Yair Shamir,
"attained the rank of colonel
and served as head of the electronics department, the highest professional
electronics position within the Air Force," according to his biography.
These are the kind of high-level Israeli intelligence agents that work with
Jeremy Kroll on the "advisory board" of the Challenge Fund. Kroll brings a
degree in fine arts (French and Italian) from Georgetown and his executive
position with Kroll to the table. Who do you think makes the decisions in
this group?
It was, I submit, through these connections with Kroll and Greenberg that
agents of Israeli military intelligence gained control of security of the
World Trade Center and were able to carry out 9-11.
