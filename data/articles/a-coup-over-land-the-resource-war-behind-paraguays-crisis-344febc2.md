Each bullet hole on the downtown Asunción,
Paraguay light posts tells a story.
Some of them are from civil wars decades ago,
some from successful and unsuccessful coups, others from police crackdowns.
The size of the hole, the angle of the ricochet, all tell of an escape, a
death, another dictator in the palace by the river.
On June 22 of this year, a new tyrant entered the government palace. The
right-wing Federico Franco became president in what has been deemed a
parliamentary coup against democratically-elected, left-leaning President
Fernando Lugo.
What lies behind todays headlines, political fights and struggles for
justice in Paraguay is a conflict over access to land; land is power and
money for the elites, survival and dignity for the poor, and has been at the
center of major political and social battles in Paraguay for decades. In
order to understand the crisis in post-coup Paraguay, its necessary to
grasp the political weight of the nations soil.
Here, a look at the history of Paraguay's
resource war for land, the events leading up to the coup, and the story of
one farming communitys resistance places land at the heart of nations
current crisis.
The Coup and the Land
Hope surrounded the electoral victory of Fernando Lugo in 2008, a victory
which ended the right wing Colorado Partys 61 year dominance of Paraguayan
politics.
It was a victory against the injustice and
nightmare of the Alfredo Stroessner dictatorship (1954-1989), and a
new addition to the regions left-leaning governments. The election of Lugo,
a former bishop and adherent to liberation theology, was due in large part
to grassroots support from the campesino (small farmer) sector and Lugo's
promise of long-overdue land reform.
Yet Lugo was isolated politically from the very beginning. He needed to ally
with the right to win the election; his Vice President Federico Franco is a
leader in the right wing Liberal Party and was a vocal opponent of Lugo
since shortly after Lugo came to power. Throughout Lugos time in office the
Colorado Party maintained a majority in Congress and there were various
right wing attempts to impeach the Red Bishop.
Such challenges have impeded Lugos progress and
created a political and media environment dominated by near-constant attacks
and criticism toward Lugo.
At the same time, Lugo was no friend of the campesino sector that helped
bring him into power. His administration regularly called for the
severe
repression and criminalization of the countrys campesino movements.
He was therefore isolated from above at the
political level, and lacked a strong political base below due to his stance
toward social movements and the slow pace of land reform. None the less,
many leftist and campesino sectors still saw Lugo as a relative ally and
source of hope in the face of the right wing alternative.
The issue that finally tipped the scales toward the June 22 Parliamentary
coup against Lugo was a conflict over land. In April of this year, 60
landless campesinos
occupied land in Curuguaty, in northeastern Paraguay.
This land is owned by former Colorado Senator
Blas N. Riquelme, one of the richest people and largest landowners in
the country. In 1969, the Stroessner administration illegally gave Riquelme
50,000 hectares of land that was supposed to be destined to poor farmers as
a part of land reform.
Since the return to democracy in 1989,
campesinos have been struggling to gain access to this land.
The April occupation of land was one such
attempt. On June 15, security forces arrived in Curuguaty to evict the
landless settlement. The subsequent confrontation during the eviction (the
specific details of which are still
shrouded in confusion) led to the death
of 17 people, including 11 campesinos and 6 police officers. Eighty people
were wounded.
While certainly the bloodiest confrontation of this kind since the
dictatorship, it was but one of dozens of such conflicts that had taken
place in recent years in a nation with enormous inequality in land
distribution. The rights response to such conflicts typically involved
siding with the land owners and business leaders, and criminalizing
campesino activists. With the tragedy of Curuguaty, the right saw yet
another opportunity to move against Lugo.
The right blamed Lugo for the bloody events at Curuguaty, an accusation
which was unfounded, but served as fodder for the ongoing political attacks
against the president.
In response to critics,
Lugo replaced his
Interior Minister with Colorado Party member Candia Amarilla, a former State
Prosecutor known for his criminalization of leftist social and campesino
groups, and who was trained in Colombia to export Plan Colombia-style
policies to Paraguay. Lugo also made the Police Commissioner Moran Arnaldo
Sanabria (who was in charge of the Curuguaty operation) the National
Director of Police.
In this way, Lugo handed over the states main security and repressive
powers to the Colorado Party. The move was an an effort to avoid impeachment
from the right,
but it backfired; the Liberal Party opposed Lugos
replacements and, empowered by the criticisms leveled against Lugos
handling of Curuguaty, collaborated with the Colorado Party and other right
wing parties in Congress to move forward with the impeachment.
The process began on June 21, and within 24 hours the Senate gathered and
officially initiated the trial, granting Lugo only two hours to defend
himself. The next day, Lugo was removed from office in a 39-4 vote.
He was accused of encouraging landless farmers'
occupations, poor performance as president, and failing to bring about
social harmony in the country. Lugo stepped down and Vice President and
Liberal Party leader Federico Franco took his place. New elections are now
scheduled to take place in April of 2013.
This Parliamentary coup was condemned as undemocratic and illegal by
many
Latin American leaders who refused to recognize Franco as the legitimate
president. In response to the coup, Latin American trade and political blocs
such as Unasur and Mercosur have suspended Paraguays participation in their
organizations until next years elections.
Unsurprisingly, the Organization of American
States decided to not suspend Paraguays membership in the group because,
according to
OAS secretary general Jose Miguel Insulza, doing so
would create further problems in the country and isolate it regionally.
This is the second such coup in the region in
recent years; in June 2009, Honduran President Manuel Zelaya was
ousted under
similar circumstances.
The backdrop to this political fight is a struggle over how to control, use
and distribute Paraguays vast land. Approximately 2% of landowners control
80% of Paraguays land, and some 87,000 farming families are landless.
While Lugo failed to meet many of his campaign
promises to the campesino sector, he did in fact work to block many of the
rights policies that would worsen the crisis in the countryside. For
example, Lugo and his cabinet resisted the use of Monsantos transgenic
cotton seeds in Paraguay, a move that likely
contributed to his ouster.
Yet even before Lugo was elected, political
alliances and victories were shaped by the question of land.
Multinational agro-industrial corporations are
fully entrenched in Paraguayan politics, and their fundamental enemies in
this resource war have always been the Paraguayan campesino.
A Sea of Soy
For decades small farmers in Paraguay have been tormented by a tidal wave of
GMO soy crops and pesticides expanding across the countryside.
Paraguay is the fourth largest producer of soy
in the world, and
soy makes up 40 percent of Paraguayan exports and 10
percent of the countrys GDP.
An estimated twenty million liters of
agrochemicals are sprayed across Paraguay each year, poisoning the people,
water, farmland and livestock that come in its path.
Managing the gargantuan agro-industry are transnational seed, agricultural
and agro-chemical companies including,
International financial institutions and
development banks have promoted and bankrolled the agro-export business of
monoculture crops - much of Paraguayan soy goes to feed animals in Europe.
The profits have united political and corporate
entities from Brazil, the US, and Paraguay, and increased the importance of
Paraguays cooperation with international businesses.
Since the 1980s, national military and paramilitary groups connected to
large agribusinesses and landowners have evicted almost 100,000 small
farmers from their homes and fields and forced the relocation of countless
indigenous communities in favor of soy fields.
While more than a hundred campesino leaders have
been assassinated in this time, only one of the cases was investigated with
results leading to the conviction of the killer. In the same period, more
than two thousand other campesinos have faced trumped-up charges for their
resistance to the soy industry.
The vast majority of Paraguayan farmers have
been poisoned off their land either intentionally or as a side effect of the
hazardous pesticides dumped by soy cultivation in Paraguay every year.
Beginning in the 1990s, as farmers saw their animals dying, crops withering,
families sickening, and wells contaminated, most packed up and moved to the
city.
The havoc wreaked by agro-industries has created some of the most grave
human rights violations since Stroessners reign.
A report produced by the Committee of Economic,
Social, and Cultural Rights of the United Nations stated that,
the expansion of the cultivation of soy has
brought with it the indiscriminate use of toxic pesticides, provoking
death and sickness in children and adults, contamination of water,
disappearance of ecosystems, and damage to the traditional nutritional
resources of the communities.
The expansion of the soy industry has occurred
in tandem with violent oppression of small farmers and indigenous
communities who occupy the vast land holdings of the wealthy.
Most rural Paraguayans cultivate diverse
subsistence crops on small plots of ten to twenty hectares, but do not have
titles to their land nor do they typically receive assistance from the
state. The Paraguayan government has historically represented the soy
growers in this conflict by using the police and judicial system to punish
campesino leaders.
The small farming community of Tekojoja has been on the front line of this
struggle for years. Its history and struggle is representative of countless
other farming communities in the Paraguayan countryside.
Tekojojas Resistance
The first of several buses we would take from Asunción toward Tekojoja in
April of 2009 heated up like a sauna as polka played on the radio.
Hawkers came on the bus selling sunglasses,
radios, and pirated DVDs. Particularly dedicated salesmen gave impassioned
speeches about the superior characteristics of their product, pushing
samples onto the unwilling and bored passengers. One sales pitch promised
that garlic pills could cure insomnia and cancer.
We passed countless fields of soy and Cargill silos, but also vegetable
stands from small farmers and simple roadside restaurants where people could
escape into the shade with a cold beer. The dirt road from Caaguazú toward
Tekojoja was a rutted expanse of churning red sand; it took us three hours
to travel 50 kilometers.
The bus fought its way over the deep potholes,
the engine reaching a fevered pitch, and every one of its metal bones
rattling along with those of its passengers.
That same night, we arrived in Tekojoja and went to Gilda Roas house, a
government-made structure without running water (though the government built
the buildings, it never completed the plumbing).
A land and farmer rights activist, Roas shirt
portrayed plants breaking through a bar code. Inside her house, the walls
were covered with anti-soy and anti-GMO posters. She pulled up plastic
chairs for us in front of the garden with bright stars as a backdrop, and
began talking.
Roa spent 20002002 in Asunción studying to be a
nurse, and had worked as one in a nearby town. At the time of our visit, in
April of 2009, she was dedicated exclusively to activism in her community.
As Paraguayan folk music played on the radio, and moths bounced around the
lights, Roa told us the story of her community and its fight against GMO
soy.
The community of Tekojoja is home of the Popular Agrarian Movement (MAP) of
Paraguay. It is a place that has faced enormous repression from the soy
farmers and their thugs, and led a legendary resistance against them,
producing many campesino leaders.
Tekojoja stands on land given to campesinos as part of a Public Land Reform
Program.
In the 1990s, Brazilian soy farmers - with armed thugs, lawyers,
and political connections to protect them - gradually expanded onto the
communitys land, forcing a series of violent evictions of the farming
families. In 2003, the MAP began to recover the lands taken from them by
Brazilians, but corrupt judges and the mercenaries hired by soy producers
kept pushing the farmers off their land.
On December 2, 2004, Brazilian land owners accompanied by police burned down
numerous houses and farmland in Tekojoja as part of an eviction process.
A statement from the MAP
described this brutal
act:
[A]fter the tractors destroyed our crops,
they came with their big machines and started immediately to sow soy
while smoke was still rising from the ashes of our houses.
The next day we came back with oxen and
replanted all the fields over the prepared land. When the police came,
we faced them with our tools and machetes. There were around seventy of
us and we were ready to confront them. In the end they left.
The campesinos houses and crops were destroyed
and they had no assurances that the Brazilians would not orchestrate another
eviction. Still, as most had no place to go, the community members decided
to persevere, staying on the land and fighting for legal recognition as the
owners.
Roa explained,
We planted seeds with fear as we didnt
know if our crops would be destroyed. And we began to reconstruct the
houses.
But again at 4 a.m. on June 24, 2005, the
Brazilians and police attacked the community.
They arrested children, blind people, old
men, and pregnant women, everyone, throwing them all in a truck. Roa
said. They threw gas and oil on the houses, burning them all down as
the arrests went on.
In this standoff between the thugs, police, and
unarmed campesinos, two farmers, who the Brazilians mistakenly identified as
MAP leaders and brothers Jorge and Antonio Galeano, were killed by gunfire.
One of the victims was Angel Cristaldo Rotela, a
23 year old who was about to be married, and had just finished building his
own home the day before the police burned it to the ground. The wife of
Leoncio Torres, the other victim, was left a widow with eight children. A
memorial stands in the center of the community in memory of the fallen
campesinos.
After the murders, campesinos and activists from around the country rallied
in support of Tekojoja, supplying the besieged community members with tarps
and food.
Finally, the Supreme Court ruled that the land
should go to the local farmers, and as part of the reparations for the
violence the community suffered, President Nicanor Frutos commissioned the
building of forty-eight homes.
The plight of Tekojoja sheds light on the
situation many farming communities are finding themselves in across
Paraguay. While the residents of Tekojoja remain on their land, many others
are forced to flee to slums in the city as soy producers push them off their
land.
Roa explained this cycle of displacement:
When the small farmers are desperate, and
the pesticides are hurting them, there is no money, and so they sell
their land for a little money, which is more than theyve ever had,
thinking that life in the city will be better, easy - but its not so
easy.
A lot of people who end up gathering garbage
in the city are from the countryside.
They dont know how to manage their money,
so for example, theyll spend all their money on a used, broken-down car
first, and then end up in the city broke, without any jobs or place to
stay.
The victory of Tekojoja was due to the tenacity
of the farmers who refused to leave their land for the false promise of rich
city life.
But their fight is far from over. Though they
tore the soy plants out of their land, residents live sandwiched between
seemingly limitless expanses of soy, and they, their animals, and their
crops continue to suffer from exposure to toxic pesticides.
By dawn the next day, most of Roas neighbors were already up, getting to
work before the sun made labor unbearable. Chickens milled about houses, the
red dirt yards were still damp from the nights dew, and radios tuned in to
a community radio station mixing music with political commentary in Guaraní.
A neighboring community activist invited us to
his house to start the day with Paraguayans essential beverage, yerba mate
served hot in the morning and specially prepared with coconut and rosemary.
We sat in his kitchen as the sun streamed through the cracks between the
boards in the wall, illuminating ribbons of smoke from the fire, while his
children and pigs played on the dirt floor.
An ominous presence loomed over this bucolic scene. The neighboring
Brazilian soy farmers had already shown up with their tractors, spraying
pesticides on nearby crops. I could smell the chemicals in the air already.
We walked toward the fields until the sweet,
toxic odor grew stronger. We passed one tractor very closely as clouds of
the pesticides drifted toward us. I began to feel a disorienting sensation
of dizziness and nausea. My eyes, throat and lungs burned and my head ached,
something the locals go through on a daily basis. The physical illness
caused by the pesticides contributes to breaking down the campesino
resistance.
I am reminded that this is a besieged community, not just because of the soy
crops that circle these islands of humanity, or the pesticides that seep
into every water source, crop, and conversation, but also because the
Brazilian soy farmers live next to and drive through these impoverished
communities with total impunity, and with the windows of their shiny new
trucks rolled up tightly.
Mounted somewhat precariously on the back of a
few mopeds, we bounced along the dirt roads, which petered out into paths to
another cluster of homes. On our way there, we passed one Brazilian who
glared at us until we were out of sight.
Roa knew him:
he had participated
in the razing and burning of their homes.
The fact that he was still free added insult to
injury.
And if the locals were to accuse him, said Roa,
or even yell at the Brazilian murderers, police would show up and haul them
off to jail.
This is the hardest part, she explained.
That we see them and cant do anything.
The moped rolled to a stop in front of Virginia
Barrientos home, a few miles from Roas, directly bordering a soy field.
The land Barrientos lived on for the past four
years is a peninsula jutting into the sea of soy. She occupied her land,
which used to be covered with soy, in February of 2005 and won legal
ownership to it.
But life since gaining the land has been far
from easy; pesticides have terrorized her family since they moved there.
Just before we harvest our food the
Brazilians will spray very powerful pesticides, Barrientos explained.
This spraying causes the headaches, nausea, diarrhea we all suffer.
Her thin children were gathered with her on the
porch of the home.
There are a lot of problems with the
water, she continued. When it rains, the pesticides affect our only
water source.
Barrientos said the pesticides affected her
plants and animals as well, making some of the crops that do actually grow
taste too bitter to eat.
Her pigs newborn babies died, and the chickens
were ill. Part of the problem, she pointed out, is that the Brazilian soy
farmers intentionally choose to fumigate during strong winds which blow the
poison onto her land.
We passed dead corn stalks on the way to her well,
which she insisted on showing us.
It was located at the end of a long field of
soy, so that the runoff from the field dripped into the well, concentrating
the pesticides in her only water source. The family lives in a poisoned
misery, while the soy producer responsible for it lives in comparative
luxury away from his fields.
Isabel Rivas, a neighbor of Barrientos with a big smile and loud laugh in
spite of her grim living situation, told us,
When we drink the water we can smell the
chemicals. It turns out they were washing the chemical sprayers in our
source of water, in a little stream nearby.
Barrientos stood in front of her house while
breastfeeding her baby as chickens pecked at peanuts in the yard.
Her
children stared at us with wide eyes.
We cant go anywhere else.
While Lugos inability and unwillingness to
sufficiently address such hardships was a betrayal of this grassroots
sector, the recent coup against Lugo was also a coup against hope, a coup
against Barrientos and her children, Roas and her neighbors, and the
hundreds of thousands of farmers struggling the countryside.
Behind this coup lies the vast land, some of it
poisoned, some still fertile, and much of it tear and blood-soaked.
Until the demand of land justice is realized,
there will be no peace in Paraguay, regardless of who sleeps in the
presidential palace.
