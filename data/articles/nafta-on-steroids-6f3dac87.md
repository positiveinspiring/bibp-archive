The Trans-Pacific Partnership,
which would grant enormous new powers
to corporations,
is a massive assault on democracy.

While the Occupy movement has forced a public discussion of extreme
corporate influence on every aspect of our lives, behind closed doors
corporate America is implementing a stealth strategy to formalize its rule
in a truly horrifying manner.
The mechanism is
the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Negotiations have been conducted in extreme
secrecy, so you are in good company if you have never heard of it. But the
thirteenth round of negotiations between the United States and eight Pacific
Rim nations will be held in San Diego in early July.
The TPP has been cleverly misbranded as a trade agreement (yawn) by its
corporate boosters. As a result, since George W. Bush initiated
negotiations in 2008, it has cruised along under the radar.
The Obama administration initially paused the
talks, ostensibly to develop a new approach compatible with candidate
Obamas pledges to replace the old NAFTA-based trade model. But by late
2009, talks restarted just where Bush had left off.
Since then, US negotiators have proposed new rights
for Big Pharma and pushed into the text
aspects of the Stop Online Piracy Act, which would limit Internet
freedom, despite the derailing
of
SOPA in Congress earlier this year thanks to public activism.
In June a text of the TPP investment chapter was
leaked, revealing that US negotiators are even pushing to expand NAFTAs
notorious corporate tribunals, which have been used to attack domestic
public interest laws.
Think of the TPP as a stealthy delivery mechanism for policies that could
not survive public scrutiny. Indeed, only two of the twenty-six chapters of
this corporate Trojan horse cover traditional trade matters.
The rest embody the most florid dreams of the 1 percent - grandiose new
rights and privileges for corporations and permanent constraints on
government regulation.
They include new investor safeguards to ease job
offshoring and assert control over natural resources, and severely
limit the regulation of financial services, land use, food safety, natural
resources, energy, tobacco, healthcare and more.
The stakes are extremely high, because the TPP may well be the last trade
agreement Washington negotiates. This is because if its completed, the TPP
would remain open for any other country to join.
In May US Trade Representative Ron Kirk
said he would love nothing more than to have China join.
In June Mexico and Canada entered the process,
creating a NAFTA on steroids, with most of Asia to boot.
Countries would be obliged to conform all their domestic laws and
regulations to the TPPs rules - in effect, a corporate coup d√©tat.
The proposed pact would limit even how
governments can spend their tax dollars. Buy America and other Buy Local
procurement preferences that invest in the US economy would be banned, and
sweat-free, human rights or environmental conditions on government
contracts could be challenged.
If the TPP comes to fruition, its retrograde
rules could be altered only if all countries agreed, regardless of domestic
election outcomes or changes in public opinion. And unlike much domestic
legislation, the TPP would have no expiration date.
Failure to conform domestic laws to the rules would subject countries to
lawsuits before TPP tribunals empowered to authorize trade sanctions against
member countries. The leaked investment chapter also shows that the
TPP would expand the parallel legal system included in NAFTA.
Called Investor-State Dispute Resolution,
it empowers corporations to sue governments - outside their domestic court
systems - over any action the corporations believe undermines their expected
future profits or rights under the pact. Three-person international
tribunals of attorneys from the private sector would hear these cases.
The lawyers rotate between serving as judges -
empowered to order governments to pay corporations unlimited amounts in
fines - and representing the corporations that use this system to raid
government treasuries. The NAFTA version of this scheme has forced
governments to pay more than $350 million to corporations after suits
against toxic bans, land-use policies, forestry rules and more.
The slight mainstream media coverage the TPP has received repeats the usual
mantra: its a free-trade pact that will expand US exports.
But trade is the least of it.
The United States already has free-trade
agreements that eliminated tariffs with most TPP countries, which highlights
the fact that the TPP is mainly about new corporate rights, not trade.
Besides, under past free-trade agreements, US export growth to partner
countries is half as much as to countries with which we do not have such
agreements.
Since NAFTA and similar pacts went into effect,
the United States has been slammed by a massive trade deficit, which has
cost more than 5 million jobs and led to the loss of more than 50,000
manufacturing plants.
How could something this extreme have gotten so far? The process has been
shockingly secretive.
In 2010 TPP countries agreed not to release
negotiating texts until four years after a deal was done or abandoned. Even
the World Trade Organization, hardly a paragon of transparency, releases
draft negotiating texts. This means that although the TPP could rewrite vast
swaths of domestic policy affecting every aspect of our lives, the
public, press and Congress are locked out.
Astoundingly, Senator Ron Wyden, chair of
the Senate committee with official jurisdiction over TPP, has been denied
access even to US proposals to the negotiations. But 600 corporate
representatives serving as official US trade advisers have full access to
TPP texts and a special role in negotiations.
When challenged about the conflict with the
Obama administrations touted commitment to transparency, Trade
Representative Kirk noted that after the release of the Free Trade Area
of the Americas (FTAA)
text in 2001, that deal could not be completed.
In other words, the official in charge of the
TPP says the only way to complete the deal is to keep it secret from the
people who would have to live with the results.
The goal was to complete the TPP this year (2012).
Thankfully, opposition by some countries to the
most extreme corporate demands has slowed negotiations. Australia has
announced it will not submit to the parallel corporate court system, and it
and New Zealand have rejected a US proposal to allow pharmaceutical
companies to challenge their government medicine formularies pricing
decisions, which have managed to keep their drug costs much lower than in
the United States.
Every country has rejected the US
proposal to extend drug patent monopolies.
This text was leaked, allowing government health
officials and activists in all the countries to fight back. Many countries
have also rejected a US proposal that would forbid countries from using
capital controls, taxes or other macro-prudential measures to limit the
destructive power of financial speculators.
However, we face a race against time - much of the TPP text has been agreed
on.
-
Will the banksters, Big Pharma, Big Oil,
agribusiness, tobacco multinationals and
the other usual suspects get away
with this massive assault on democracy?
-
Will the public wake up to this threat
and fight back, demanding either a fair deal or no deal?
The Doha Round of WTO expansion, the FTAA and
other corporate attacks via trade agreements were successfully derailed
when citizens around the world took action to hold their governments
accountable.
Certainly in an election year, we are well
poised to turn around the TPP as well.
