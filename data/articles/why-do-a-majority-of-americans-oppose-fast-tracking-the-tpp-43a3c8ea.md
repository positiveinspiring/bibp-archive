# Why Do a Majority of Americans Oppose Fast-tracking the TPP?

A recent poll reveals a majority of
Americans oppose giving President
Obama the power to make an end run
around the Constitution by "fast tracking" the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP).
In a press release issued by Communications
Workers of America, survey results indicate that 62 percent of
respondents totally oppose,
"having Congress give the president
fast-track authority [aka Trade Promotion Authority] for a new
Pacific trade agreement."
One of the questions asked by pollsters Hart
Research and Chesapeake Beach Consulting accurately explained that if
the president were given this authority,
"Once the administration's negotiations
are completed, Congress must take an up-or-down vote on the
agreement as a whole, and could not make any amendments or changes
in the agreement."
Given the myriad difficulties dogging
negotiators from the 12 countries currently included in the trade pact
region, blocking the granting of such sweeping power is critical.
Additionally, in light of significant
bipartisan opposition to the agreement, it would seem that only
President Obama can close the deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Part of that includes persuading Congress to "fast track" negotiation of
the TPP, in the form of a Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) bill.
The TPA is a tool that the president demands
be in the U.S. trade representative's bag when he sits down with his
colleagues from the other TPP participants.
Forbes
reports:
TPA or "fast track" is essential for the
President to complete negotiations. Negotiators for our trading partners
would be foolish to sign off on a treaty unless they knew that the
Congress could not amend it.
And:
A TPA bill would allow the Trans Pacific
Partnership Treaty, said to be in its final stages, to be completed and
ratified. In addition to its trade and economic benefits, TPP is the
most prominent piece of the Obama "pivot to Asia," his attempt to
exercise more leadership in the area.
TPP is supposed to lead the region to our
version of open, reciprocal trade rather than have the region move
toward the Chinese mercantilist model.
That would be a little more believable were
it not for the fact that the president himself has entertained the
inclusion of China in the TPP.
As
The New American reported,
President Obama has signaled that he would entertain the idea of the
Chinese communist government's partnership in the bloc.
President Obama's fascination with
intertwining the economic welfare of the United States with that of
China is perhaps one reason one commentator called the TPP,
"another disaster from
a
proven liar."
Perhaps it is this sinister ulterior motive
that prompts the president to doggedly protect the secrecy surrounding
the drafting of the TPP treaty.
In spite of strident efforts on the part of
all TPP partners to keep the deal hidden, in November 2013, portions of
the
TPP draft agreement published by WikiLeaks contained sketches of
President Obama's plans to surrender American sovereignty to
international tribunals.
Another WikiLeaks disclosure
in January of
this year revealed that the president was attempting to surrender
sovereignty over U.S. environmental policy to international bureaucrats
interested in lowering those standards to mirror those of our TPP
partner nations.
U.S. copyright laws, Internet freedom, and
Web-based publishing would also be obliterated by the TPP, and, although
it hasn't been widely reported, the TPP would give
the developing global
government,
sweeping surveillance powers, as well.
Although the American people (and the people
of all nations involved in the pact) are prevented from seeing - and
therefore commenting on - the treaty being ostensibly negotiated on
their behalf, multinational corporations have seats at the trading
table.
While the TPP grants corporate giants such
as Walmart and
Monsanto the power to bypass Congress and the courts, the
elected representatives of the American people are kept from even seeing
the draft version of the agreement.
As with the multitude of similar trade pacts
the United States has formed, the ultimate aim of the TPP is the
creation of a regional super government - thus the stonewalling of
federal lawmakers who dare seek to assert some sort of oversight.
In the case of the TPP, the zone would be
called the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP).
Members of the
proposed "free trade" bloc include all the current TPP participants:
-
Malaysia
-
Singapore
-
Japan
-
Vietnam
-
Brunei
-
Australia
-
New Zealand
-
Peru
-
Mexico
-
Chile
-
Canada
-
the United States.
The regional trading partnership is intended
to establish,
"a comprehensive free trade agreement
across the region."
The ultimate goal of the TPP isn't just the
creation of an FTAAP, though.
Supporters of the deal insist that the TPP
is a,
"trade agreement designed to achieve
broad liberalization and a high degree of economic integration among
the parties."
Integration is a word that is painful to the
ears of constitutionalists and those unwilling to surrender U.S.
sovereignty to a committee of globalists who are unelected by the
American people and unaccountable to them.
Integration is an internationalist tool for
subordinating American law to the globalist bureaucracy
at the United
Nations.
Economic and political integration will push
the once-independent United States of America into yet another
collectivist bloc that will facilitate the complete dissolution of our
country and our states into no more than subordinate outposts of a
one-world government.
If constitutionalists and other parties
interested in keeping the power of enacting trade, manufacturing, and
environmental laws at home as mandated in the Constitution, perhaps the
next poll will show an impressive increase in the number of Americans
ready to reject President Obama's effort to shove the secret surrender
of sovereignty down our throats.
