Bill Gates, the heavy Monsanto investor who purchased 500,000 shares of the biotech giant in 2010, has been touting Monsantos genetically modified creations as a tool that is necessary to prevent starvation in poor nations.
The same poor nations where thousands of farmers routinely commit suicide after being completely bankrupt by Monsantos overpriced and ineffective GM seeds.
The same company that we recently exposed to be running slave-like working conditions, forcing poor workers to operate the corn fields for 14 hours per day while withholding pay. According to Gates, this is the company whose GMO crops are going to save the world from starvation. Of course, along with saving the world from starvation, GMO crops also bring along a large number of unwanted health and environmental effects. A prominent review of 19 studies examining the safety of these crops found that consumption of GMO corn or soybeans can lead to significant organ disruptions in rats and mice - particularly in the liver and kidneys.
Are Monsantos Devastating Creations Really the Answer to World Hunger? Whats more is that Monsantos best-selling herbicide, Roundup, has been completely devastating farmlands for years through the creation of resistant superweeds.
Experts estimate Roundup usage to result in the destruction of over at least 120 million hectares of farmland thanks to these superweeds. Is it any wonder that in 2008 a startling report uncovered Monsantos blatant abuse of poor farmers in the very poor countries that will supposedly benefit from GMO crops?
Thanks to an article in the Daily Mail, it was revealed that thousands of farmers were committing suicide after using Monsantos GM seeds.
Due to failing harvests and drastically inflated prices, the bankrupt poor farmers began taking their lives - oftentimes drinking the very same chemical concoctions provided by Monsanto as a method of suicide.
We are ruined now, said the dead mans 38-year-old wife. We bought 100 grams of BT Cotton. Our crop failed twice. My husband had become depressed. He went out to his field, lay down in the cotton and swallowed insecticide.

Monsanto actually conned the farmers into buying their GM seeds, majorly overpriced and performing far worse than even traditional seeds.
Monsanto went as far as to charge these poor farmers Â£10 for 100 grams of GM seed, while they could have purchased 1,000 times more traditional seeds for the same amount.
The result? A career-ending harvest that led to mass farmer suicide. It is quite clear that Monsanto really has no intention of helping these farmers fight starvation in their communities, as Monsanto investor Bill Gates would have you think.
You can view Bill Gates' speech about how GMO crops are the answer to starvation and see for yourself how he puts such strong emphasis on that selling point:
Return to Monsanto - A Multinational Factory of Death
