Following the
Obama administration's
deeply controversial decision to
cede U.S. control over key elements of the Internet's
architecture, experts and former officials are warning that the
United Nations and its largely autocratic member regimes are already
plotting to tax and censor the World Wide Web.
According to analysts, the UN would almost
certainly start small - perhaps levying tiny "fees" on certain Web-based
activities, or regulating content that virtually everybody would find
objectionable - before quickly expanding the global Internet regime to raise
vast sums of taxpayer cash while censoring free speech.
The battle, however, is likely to be fierce.
Among the most troubling scenarios envisioned by
multiple experts is the very real possibility that, by imposing taxes on Web
use, the UN would finally be able to free itself from the last remaining
constraint on its growth and power - the fact that it currently depends on
member governments for funding.
Indeed, at least one university professor is
even sounding the alarm about the new "robber barons" at the UN, salivating
over the prospect of imposing planetary taxes via control of the Internet.
However, Prof. Karl Borden, who teaches
financial economics at the University of Nebraska, warned in a
Wall Street Journal column that the
threat posed
by United Nations taxers would be even more severe and hard to fight.
The original "robber barons," he explained, were
13th century extortionists along the Rhine River who forced passing ships to
pay tribute in exchange for passage.
If the UN gets its way on global Internet taxes,
though, the damage would be far worse than the havoc caused by powerful
German thieves of centuries past.
"Should the U.N. end up in charge, it would
have a chokehold on the global economy and a vast stream of revenue that
would make it even more unaccountable than it already is," Borden
explained, adding that global Internet taxes would start modestly before
ballooning out of control, much like the U.S. income tax.
"Power follows the money, and bureaucratic
appetites are voracious," he continued.
"Who will there be to stop the process,
after all? Where is the elected legislative body that will answer to the
world's population that finally pays these 'fees'?... With
constitutional government it becomes at least possible for citizens to
say 'No - No more!'.
No such checks are in place for a global
bureaucracy that will have the power to reach into every pocket on
earth."
With the Internet set to become the essential
infrastructure for participating in the global economy, Borden said,
controlling the "rivers" of the future will permit the financing of a
perpetually expanding international bureaucracy.
The implications are frightening - especially
because getting rid of the global extortion would be extraordinarily tough
once it got going.
"The robber barons of the 13th century were
finally stopped only when the Rhine League, consisting of merchants and
aristocrats, banded together to tear down their castles and hang them,"
Borden concluded.
"The robber barons of the 21st century may
be much more difficult to deal with."
Indeed, countless critics have been
warning for decades, if and when the UN
gets the power to impose its own taxes, it would be able to fund its
own "peace" army, police, tax collectors,
regulators, bureaucrats, and global tyranny without any remaining
constraints.
While the outfit, often blasted as the
"dictators' club," has floated proposals to tax everything from billionaires
and financial transactions to "carbon emissions" and air travel, the
prospect of a global Internet tax could be even more appealing.
Former U.S. officials have also issued similar
warnings in recent weeks about the potential for Internet mischief if the UN
were to ever be allowed near the levers of online power.
"This is the Obama equivalent of Carter's
decision to give away the Panama Canal - only with possibly much worse
consequences," former Bush administration State Department senior
advisor Christian Whiton told the Daily Caller last month after the
administration announced the end of its constitutionally dubious ties to
the California-based organization that manages crucial components of the
Internet's architecture.
"While the Obama administration says it is
merely removing federal oversight of a non-profit, we should assume
ICANN would end up as part of the United Nations," Whiton continued.
"If the U.N. gains control [of] what amounts
to the directory and traffic signals of the Internet, it can impose
whatever taxes it likes. It likely would start with a tax on registering
domains and expand from there... What little control there is over the
U.N. would be gone."
Also alarming, Whiton noted that under
"invariably incompetent U.N. control," a hostile foreign power might even be
able to disable America's Internet access - with potentially devastating
consequences.
Of course, as
documented extensively, the UN and numerous
"member" dictators around the world -
from Communists and Socialists to Islamists
- have been scheming for years to take over and regulate the Internet.
Multiple ploys have been attempted, with
globalists and autocrats particularly pushing an effort to have the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) seize control over the Web at a
series of globalist conferences. One proposal even called for the creation
of an Internet "kill switch." Another would have created a global
surveillance regime to monitor everyone's online activities.
Taxes, too, have been high on the agenda for the
would-be planetary Internet regulators.
All of those schemes
failed at the time, partly due to
resistance from the West, but the threat never dissipated. In March, though,
with global outrage boiling over lawless and unconstitutional
NSA spying,
the Obama administration's Department of Commerce made a stunning, quiet
announcement.
Building on plans first developed under former
President
Bush, the U.S. government revealed that it would be
relinquishing all remaining control over the so-called "root" or "keys" of
the Internet next year to a non-profit multinational organization known as
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or
ICANN.
As part of the plan to "transition" toward
Internet control by so-called "global stakeholders," U.S. officials vowed to
keep online freedom alive.
"I want to make clear that we will not
accept a proposal that replaces the [Department of Commerce's National
Telecommunications and Information Administration] role with a
government-led or an intergovernmental solution," said NTIA chief Larry
Strickling, echoing past statements by administration officials.
As
reported last month, the ICANN organization
has also promised to keep the Internet free.
However, a statement by its current director,
Fade Chehade, about "the world" wanting to "participate" in "shaping"
the Web has sparked concerns - especially the notion that the "global
community" would be replacing U.S. stewardship of the Internet with
"appropriate oversight mechanisms."
Chehade signed an international declaration last
year that also alarmed critics, saying that stakeholders, "including all
governments," would be allowed to participate in the "globalization" of
ICANN on an "equal footing."
Meanwhile, numerous experts and officials are
already warning that the upcoming "transition" in Internet governance risks
allowing the UN and its mostly dictatorial "member states" to seize control
over the Web, as they have been plotting to do for years.
Think the Communist Chinese regime's "Great
Firewall of China" - but imposed on the world, eventually.
Citing a wide array of concerns, however,
countless critics, including many in Congress, are examining the issue and
considering various options to ensure that the dictators' club and its
mostly tyrannical members never get the opportunity to tax or censor the
global Internet.
"While I certainly agree our nation must
stridently review our procedures regarding surveillance in light of the
NSA controversy, to put ourselves in a situation where censorship-laden
governments like China or Russia could take a firm hold on the Internet
itself is truly a scary thought," said Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), one of
many concerned Republican lawmakers.
"I look forward to working with my
colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee and with the Commerce
Department on this, because - to be blunt - the 'global Internet
community' this would empower has no First Amendment."
The U.S. government, of course, has no
constitutional authority to control, oversee, or regulate the architecture
of the Internet.
If online freedom is to survive, though, the Web
and all of its components must be kept completely out of the hands of the
out-of-control UN and its dozens of ruthless "member states."
Indeed, aside from punishing actual crimes that
may involve the Internet in some way, experts say there is no reason for
government to have any role at all in managing the Web.
