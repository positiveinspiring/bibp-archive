China just dropped an absolute bombshell, but it
was almost entirely ignored by the mainstream media in the United States.
The central bank of China has decided that it is
"no longer in Chinas favor to accumulate foreign-exchange reserves".
During the third quarter of 2013, China's foreign-exchange reserves were
valued at approximately
$3.66 trillion.
And of course the biggest chunk of that was made
up of U.S. dollars. For years, China has been accumulating dollars and
working hard to keep the value of the dollar up and the value of the yuan
down. One of the goals has been to make Chinese products less expensive in
the international marketplace.
But now China has announced that the time has
come for it to stop stockpiling U.S. dollars. And if that does indeed turn
out to be the case, than many U.S. analysts are suggesting that China could
also soon stop buying any more U.S. debt. Needless to say, all of this
would be very bad for the United States.
For years, China has been systematically
propping up the value of the U.S. dollar and keeping the value of the yuan
artificially low. This has resulted in a massive flood of super cheap
products from across the Pacific that U.S. consumers have been eagerly
gobbling up.
For example, have you ever gone into a dollar
store and wondered how anyone could possibly make a profit by making those
products and selling them for just one dollar?
Well, the truth is that when you flip those
products over you will find that almost all of them have been made outside
of the United States. In fact, the words "made in China" are probably the
most common words in your entire household if you are anything like the
typical American.
Thanks to the massively unbalanced trade that we
have had with China, tens of thousands of our businesses, millions of our
jobs and trillions of our dollars have left this country and gone over to
China.
And now China has apparently decided that there
is not much gutting of our economy left to do and that it is time to let the
dollar collapse. As I mentioned above, China
has announced that it is going to stop stockpiling foreign-exchange reserves...
The Peoples Bank of China said the country
does not benefit any more from increases in its foreign-currency
holdings, adding to signs policy makers will rein in dollar purchases
that limit the yuans appreciation.
Its no longer in Chinas favor to
accumulate foreign-exchange reserves, Yi Gang, a deputy governor at the
central bank, said in a speech organized by China Economists 50 Forum at
Tsinghua University yesterday.
The monetary authority will basically end
normal intervention in the currency market and broaden the yuans daily
trading range, Governor Zhou Xiaochuan wrote in an article in a
guidebook explaining reforms outlined last week following a Communist
Party meeting. Neither Yi nor Zhou gave a timeframe for any changes.
It isn't going to happen overnight, but the
value of the U.S. dollar is going to start to go down, and all of that cheap
stuff that you are used to buying at Wal-Mart and the dollar store is going
to become a lot more expensive.
But of even more importance is what this latest
move by China could mean for U.S. government debt. As most Americans have
heard, we are heavily dependent on foreign nations such as China lending us
money.
Right now, China owns nearly
1.3 trillion dollars of our debt.
Unfortunately, as
CNBC is noting, if China is going to quit stockpiling our dollars
than it is likely that they will stop stockpiling our debt as well...
Analysts see this as the PBoC hinting that
it will let its currency fluctuate, without intervention, thus negating
the need for holding large reserves of the dollar.
And if the dollar is
no longer needed, then it could look to curb its purchases of
dollar-denominated assets like U.S. Treasuries.
"If they are looking to reduce these
purchases going forward then, yes, you'd have to look at who the
marginal buyer would be," Richard McGuire, a senior rate strategist
at Rabobank told CNBC in an interview.
"Together, with the Federal Reserve
tapering its bond purchases, it has the potential to add to the
bearish long-term outlook on U.S. Treasuries."
So who is going to buy all of our debt?
That is a very good question.
If
the Federal Reserve starts tapering bond
purchases and China quits buying our debt, who is going to fill the void?
If there is significantly less demand for
government bonds, that will cause interest rates to rise dramatically. And
if interest rates rise dramatically from where they are now, that will set
off
the kind of nightmare scenario that I keep
talking about.
In a previous article entitled "How
China Can Cause The Death of The Dollar and The Entire U.S. Financial System",
I described how China could single-handedly cause immense devastation to the
U.S. economy.
China accounts for more global trade that anyone
else does, and they also own more of our debt than any other nation does.
If China starts dumping our dollars and our debt, much of the rest of the
planet would likely follow suit and we would be in for a world of hurt.
And just this week there was another major
announcement which indicates that China is getting ready to make a major
move against the U.S. dollar.
According to
Reuters, crude oil futures may soon be
priced in yuan on the Shanghai Futures Exchange...
The Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE)
may price its crude oil futures contract in yuan and use medium
sour crude as its benchmark, its chairman said on Thursday, adding that
the bourse is speeding up preparatory work to secure regulatory
approvals.
China, which overtook the United States as
the world's top oil importer in September, hopes the contract will
become a benchmark in Asia and has said it would allow foreign investors
to trade in the contract without setting up a local subsidiary.
If that actually happens, that will be
absolutely huge.
China is the number one importer of oil in the
world, and it was only a matter of time before they started to openly
challenge the petrodollar.
But even I didn't think that we would see
anything like this so quickly.
The world is changing, and most Americans have
absolutely no idea what this is going to mean for them. As demand for the
U.S. dollar and U.S. debt goes down, the things that we buy at the store
will cost a lot more, our standard of living will go down and it will become
a lot more expensive for everyone (including the U.S. government) to borrow
money.
Unfortunately, there isn't much that can be done
about any of this at this point.
When it comes to economics, China has been
playing chess while the United States has been playing checkers. And now
decades of very, very foolish decisions are starting to catch up with us.
The false prosperity that most Americans are
enjoying today will soon start disappearing, and most of them will have no
idea why it is happening.
The years ahead are going to be very
challenging, and so I hope that you are getting ready for them.
