The worlds top powers are all paying extremely close attention to
the case
of $1 trillion in bonds now missing in Italy because whoever gets to cash
them will suddenly have enormous geopolitical power.
The owners of
the
Federal Reserve Board syndicate are hoping to be to cash their quadrillions
or quintillions (the numbers are absurdly unrealistic) in fraudulent
derivates and thus make the cashing of a few Asian gold backed $ trillions
worth of bonds into a trivial issue. Most of the countries in the world will
not accept this fraud and so the stalemate continues.
Last weeks meetings
in Washington and at
the BIS failed to resolve this issue so more intense
horse-trading is expected this week.
The public pronouncements coming out of the recent BIS meeting are, even to
the casual observer, absurd. The idea that banks will not be allowed any off
ledger accounting is absolutely correct but the
Basel 3 agreement is full of
loopholes and does not come into force until 8 years from now. In other
words, they were just stalling for time and saying nice sounding things
without substance.
The real debate was about what to do about all the outstanding dollar
denominated bonds after the shift to the gold-backed
Amero.
The key there, of course are what to do about all the trillions and
trillions of dollars worth of bonds backed by Chinese gold the Federal
Reserve Board issued in the 1930s and before. Cashing them would give Asia
huge geopolitical control over the West.
However, the fact of the matter is that the fiat currency system is now
dysfunctional and cannot be repaired no matter what contortions the Federal
Reserve Board crime syndicate resorts to.
That is why the
Office for International Treasury Control is being pushed as
a front by the people behind Davos and the UN. They hope that by using a
pliable front with an Asian face, the can stay in power. However, since
these people have been resorting to murder and genocide and have been
trying
to start WW3, the countries of the world will not accept their continued
control of the worlds monetary systems.
If no agreement is reached by the September 30th US fiscal year end, then
serious chaos is expected for the autumn and into January.
There is a lot we are being asked not to report about this issue at present
but, serious measures are being contemplated by some very powerful Western
factions aimed at resolving this issue. These measures would all take place
within a legal framework, according to high level Western intelligence and
BIS sources.
In any case, tensions remain extremely high around the world as these
negotiations continue.
As one member of a committee of 12 that claims to be
an informal interim global ruling council put it, quoting from prophecy:
there will be wars and rumors of war.
In what is probably a related move, the US has been building a missile base
aimed at China on the disputed
Senkaku Islands. When the Chinese sent a
bunch of fishing boats to spy, one was apprehended. This is what is behind
the recent Japanese/Chinese fishing boat spat.
The Americans seem to be
saying,
we still control Japan and have built a powerful military alliance
surrounding China so, if you want to fight, let us fight.
This of course, is ultimately a bluff because the people at the pentagon
know that total war with China would ultimately lead to the death of 90% of
the worlds population as well as the destruction of the Northern
hemisphere. It is merely a negotiating tactic.
The Popes visit to the UK at this time is also related to the ongoing
struggle over finance, the secret fountain of power. They are also
discussing the planned reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Needless
to say, they are talking about how the old guard can keep itself in a
position of power and influence after the new financial system gets up and
running. Of course
the Pope and Queen Elizabeth are also expected to
commiserate about being under siege within their own power structures.
In Japan meanwhile, power struggles continue.
The re-election of Prime
Minister Naoto Kan with the help of grass-roots support in his party, has
infuriated power broker Ichiro Ozawa. Ozawa is now contemplating two
strategies. One is to wait until the Kan Prime Ministership implodes and
then take over the government, probably by next spring. The other is to take
the 100 or so members of parliament who support him and leave the Democratic
Party of Japan. This would force a total realignment of Japanese politics
and a new general election.
For his part, Kan has been contacting various right-wing parties and the
rump of the Liberal Democratic Party in the hopes of forming an alliance.
Ultimately, when the dust settles, Japan is likely once again to be
dominated by a single party containing various competing factions.
However, for now political instability is the only sure bet in this country.
The factions aligned with the US will continue to take their marching orders
from whoever wins the power struggle in Washington D.C. and in Western power
corridors
