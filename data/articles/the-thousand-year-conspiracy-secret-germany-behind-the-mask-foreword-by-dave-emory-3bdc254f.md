The Thousand-Year Conspiracy
traces the origins of German chauvinism to the
ascent of the Teutonic Knights within Germanic society, following the
Papal Bull of Rimini (Golden
Bull of Rimini?) and the
Knights military defeat of the Hanseatic League.
Winkler labels the enablers of the dark side of
the German character Prusso-Teutonics and notes that, in their pursuit of
Pan-German goals, the Prusso-Teutonics do not hesitate to deal in a
cynical and ruthless manner with their own citizens.
Of particular note for contemporary Americans is
Winklers account of the deliberate, Machiavellian manipulation of the
German economy by Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht, the
American-born financier who eventually became the finance minister of the
Third Reich.
Take note of Winklers account of how Schacht
re-structured the German economy with an eye to - among other things -
driving the citizenry to such a point of hysteria that they would willingly
follow the likes of Hitler.
Compare Winklers analysis with what is taking
place today in the United States.
-
Will the American people respond to the
eventual, inevitable correction of the perilous U.S. debt situation as the
German people did to the runaway inflation of the 1920s?
-
Will the American
people lend their support to a man on a white horse as did the Germans of
the 1920s and 1930s?
Writing in 1943, Winkler foresaw that the Prusso-Teutonics would realize
their goals through the creation of a German-dominated central European
economic union (bearing a striking resemblance to todays European Monetary
Union.)
One of the principal influences on Lists
thinking was the continental concept of Napoleon, who attempted to
economically unite Europe under French influence.
Charles Andler, a French author, summed up
certain ideas of List in his work, The Origins of Pan-Germanism,
(published in 1915.) It is necessary to organize continental Europe
against England. Napoleon I, a great strategist, also knew the methods
of economic hegemony.
His continental system, which met with
opposition even from countries which might have profited from such an
arrangement should be revived, but, this time, not as an instrument of
Napoleonic domination. The idea of united Europe in a closed trade bloc
is no longer shocking if Germany assumes domination over such a bloc -
and not France.
Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, willingly or
by force, will enter this Customs Federation. Austria is assumed to be
won over at the outset. Even France, if she gets rid of her notions of
military conquest, will not be excluded. The first steps the
Confederation would take to assure unity of thought and action would be
to establish a joint representative body, as well as to organize a
common fleet.
But of course, both the headquarters of the
Federation and its parliamentary seat would be in Germany.

Winkler - 1943; pp. 15-16
The policies of List were put into practice by
Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht, Hitlers finance minister.
Various firsthand reports have given us a
fairly accurate picture of the manner in which Nazi Germany is applying
the principle of economic collaboration to the occupied countries,
and how, through her agents, she has seized control of all the great
industries of France, Belgium and Holland.
We have also seen how she has allowed the
whole of her economic policy to be dictated by Schacht. All this
indicates clearly that Hitler is merely applying the century- old
theories of List in the economic sphere.

This book, in addition to the Du Bois,
Martin, Ambruster and Borkin/Welsh texts, provide essential historical
background for comprehending
Martin Bormann - Nazi in Exile.
The genesis of the Bormann capital network
was not haphazard.
Rather, it was the outgrowth of major
historical, political and economic trends that dominate todays globalized
corporate economy.
