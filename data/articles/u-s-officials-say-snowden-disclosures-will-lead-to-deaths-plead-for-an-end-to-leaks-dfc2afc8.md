Revelations made possible through documents
leaked by former contractor
Edward Snowden could cause the deaths
of United States diplomats, citizens and soldiers, government officials said
Wednesday, and remaining files should be surrendered immediately.
US Director of National Intelligence James
Clapper implored Mr. Snowden during a Senate Intelligence Committee
hearing in Washington, DC early Wednesday to hand over what remains of a
trove of
top-secret documents allegedly still in his
possession after fleeing the country last year with a cache of classified
material.
Officials have claimed the total number of
stolen documents could exceed 1.7 million.
Speaking before the committee, DNI Clapper and
his colleagues testified that the documents that have already been released
to the media by Snowden during the last seven months have caused a
significant blow to national security because they exposed an array of
sensitive intelligence gathering tactics that have been jeopardized as a
result.
Snowden, 30,
admitted in June to taking an undisclosed
number of documents that in the last half-year have been regularly relied on
by the international media for a number of high-profile reports about the US
National Security Agency and its British counterpart, the GCHQ.
NSA files pilfered from the computer system
Snowden had access to as a government contractor and released during the
last several months have unveiled a number of previously unreported NSA
operations, including those involving dragnet surveillance programs that put
the digital lives of millions, if not billions, of individuals across the
world into the possession of the US government.
US President
Barack
Obama has already announced plans to 'reform'
some of those programs as a result of the debate that has dominated
headlines since mid-2012 when the NSA stories based off of Snowdens leaks
started.
"For
me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the missions already
accomplished," Snowden
told the Washington Post from Moscow
last month. "I already won.
As soon as
the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to
do was validated. Because, remember, I didnt want to change society. I
wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change
itself."
At Wednesdays hearing, however, Clapper and
other members of the US intelligence community reiterated earlier claims
that the disclosing of those documents has had an immense effect on critical
counterterrorism operations.
"As a
consequence" of Snowdens actions, Clapper
said, "the nation is less safe and its
people less secure" because of what he called
"the most massive and damaging threat of
intelligence information in our history."
