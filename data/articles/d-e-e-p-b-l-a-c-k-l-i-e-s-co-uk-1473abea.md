Letter
to Dr. Edison Damanik from Bruce Mead of the Millsmead
Group dated 9th January 1996, in which Mead states that
he is the legal mandate for a "leading Bullion
Buyer located in the United Kingdom, who enjoys the
full support of a leading European Bullion Bank"
The UK domiciled "buyer" was Mr. Michael J.
Summers and the "leading European Bank" was
Credit Lyonnais Rouse Limited, the bullion trading arm
of the French state owned bank, Credit Lyonnais. The
transaction, had it gone ahead, would have moved
through an "arm's length" company, Brassdale
Limited. Note the comments in the third
paragraph showing that the "principal" was
aware of the identity of Dr. Damanik and accepts that
everything being offered by him is genuine.
