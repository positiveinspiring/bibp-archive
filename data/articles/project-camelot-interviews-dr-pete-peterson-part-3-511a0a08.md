# Project Camelot Interviews Dr Pete Peterson - Part 3

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_petepeterson03.htm

Intro
Dr. PETE PETERSON (PP):
... I wonder. I look at Earth, and I look at the things weve done to
destroy this fragile little spaceship that we live on going through
space. You know, we talk about burning, we talk badly about all the
burning of the rainforests in Brazil, and yet most of the oxygens
produced by plankton. Our use of nickel-cadmium batteries, and lead
batteries, and putting them out into the environment has killed a good
part of the plankton. Cetaceans are beaching themselves, so that theres
enough food left for the others.
Start of Interview
KERRY CASSIDY (KC): So Pete, we are very, very happy to be able to
connect with you, and you have been very generous with your time, with
your energy. I hope I have a little more energy left, because Im coming
after Bill, and after David, and I just have a few wrap-up questions
that I want to run by you, and well see how this goes.
So, one of the leading things you said was that you were involved with
robots.
PP: Thats correct.
KC: Im just wondering if we could kind of drill down there a little bit
and talk about what your background was, and how involved you really
were with robots.
PP: Well, having been involved with trying to build flying saucers, you
usually found that with flying saucers, if you look at most of the
movies, there always seems to be a robot involved with it, so I was very
interested in robots.
In the early days, when I built a satellite tracking station before
there were satellites, then tracked the Russian Sputnik when it was
launched and called the government and told them the launch trajectory
and the orbital and the frequency it was transmitting on during the
McCarthy era they thought maybe I was a Communist pinko. So they came
and found out that I actually had a satellite tracking station before
there were satellites. I was about 17 years old at the time, so that got
a lot of notoriety here in Idaho.
At that point in time in Idaho on the eastern side of the state, there
was a place that was called the Atomic Energy Commission, a nuclear
reactor test site. Its where the first nuclear power generation was
done. Anyway, they anticipated having some nuclear problems there and
decided they need some robotic-type thing that could waltz into a
nuclear meltdown and pull the reactor apart, so that they wouldnt have
a China Syndrome taking place.
So, eventually I, and a few of my friends, got the contract to do robots
that could do that. I, naturally, had great faith in myself and said: Oh
sure. [laughs]
I found out a lot of things; that was a tremendous education. I found
out that materials that were electrical conductors, inside of a heavy
nuclear flux became insulators, and insulators became conductors, and
DAVID WILCOCK (DW): Really?
PP:
very stiff metals became like toast and very brittle and broke
apart, or like ashes. Materials like ashes became very hard, and grease
became like welds...
So, eventually we built a couple of different types of... I wont call
them robots, because they were truly manipulators. They were devices
that at one end looked exactly like we think of a robot looking. It had
a pair of arms that would move and grip. Actually, we designed them so
if you could grip a beaker of liquid, you could move it very rapidly and
it would tilt it accordingly and not spill it. You could reach around
behind you or in front of you, or out to the side.
Then on the bottom of it, we had some that had three rolling wheels, and
some had little tank treads. So, this was in the 1955-6-7-8 region of
time.
KC: At that point did they have AI?
PP: No, the term hadnt even been invented yet. So anyway, on the other
end of this device that looked at one end like a robot, was a thing that
a person got into. They had a couple of small one-inch television tubes
with lenses on, and they'd put those on and they could see
stereoscopically. Then they had a couple of little hands that they could
move their arms and hands like it, and the robot would move accordingly
the manipulator would move accordingly.
KC: And there could be a distance, right? They could be back at
PP: There could be any distance up to 20 or 30 miles, but it required
wires at the time. Later we made some that worked on radio waves.
But for working with atomic materials, radio waves could be interfered
with, a number of things. They couldnt withstand that type of lack of
physical security, so all of them that we did for them had wires.
KC: So lets fast-forward to a lot more recently, or at least, may be
not even recently. I dont know when it is you got really involved in AI
and you started to...
PP: Well, first I got involved in computers. In 1975, 76 we built a
computer that was used in Tokyo at the airport to announce the plane
flights in a number of different languages. It was the first use I know
of a microprocessor chip in a real product.
Then later we built a computer training device to teach people how to
use microprocessors and how to use software to accomplish various tasks.
We built that at a little computer company whose name was Cyberdyne, and
one of the people who worked for us later worked on Terminator
whatever-it-was.
KC: Well that was my next question. [Pete laughs] So, Im not sure how
you want to answer this, but the movie, Terminator, is not so far off
base. Am I right?
PP: No, its not so far off base at all. Once we got those working and
its interesting to note that the computer chip we used in the 1970s,
there are more of those produced monthly than all the Intel chips
produced in a year, even today. Because its a chip that was actually
designed like a computer, whereas the Intel chips are not designed like
computers.
Intel is paying a lot of royalties to various people who worked in and
on various chips that evolved over the proper evolution of computer
chips what I consider to be proper. We now have a chip thats very,
very tiny, and has a number of computers built into it that
automatically look at the task and adapt themselves. So you may have 10,
20, 30 computer chips working on 30 processes all at once.
KC: In the body of one robot?
DW: In a chip.
PP: Well, in the body of one little, tiny tenth-of-an-inch-square chip.
KC: Thats operating the robot?
PP: Thats operating a robot. But once we figured out the right language
to use, and the right computer design to use, I then got involved with a
number of people working on building an artificial intelligence chip
that... well call... basically the call on it was a fuzzy logic chip.
It turns out the only logic thats not fuzzy is fuzzy logic. Its a chip
that can look at a number of different inputs, and from those make a
decision thats correct.
So, with the robot, you can be looking at bumps on the floor; you can be
looking at a doorway as compared to a wall. You can look at somebody
standing between you and the door; you can look at the width of the door
and the height of the door and decide whether it can go through it or
not. It can go over there and manipulate around the person, go through
it, not trip over the cat on the floor, etcetera, etcetera, all using
fuzzy logic.
Then, because a chip was doing digital computing a fuzzy logic chip
either does digitally (if its high-speed enough) [or] it does analogue
computing it looks at things as we see them in the real world. The
floor can be looked at digitally, like it had millions and millions of
little tiny bumps, or larger bumps; or it can be looked at
analogue-wise, because it can sense the roll of the floor and move the
wheels and so-forth so it doesnt tip over.
KC: But, werent the Japanese really advanced in terms of robotics?
PP: Well, I can tell you that when I went to the Idaho National
Engineering Labs, which is what the Atomic Energy Commission became,
which was one of the nations largest research centers. Its in eastern
Idaho. I think there are 2,200 Ph.D.s that work there. The whole town is
built around... in fact several towns are built around that center, and
much goes on there.
When we went there visiting with super-capacitors that I brought out of
the Ukraine, I got talking to some people who found out I was the one
who built the manipulators, and they said they had a large contingency
of Japanese robotics experts. This was in about 1987, 88, somewhere in
there. They had a large Japanese conference over trying to sell them
manipulators and robots, and when they saw my robots they said: My God,
we dont have anything like this. Where in the world did these come
from?
We said: Hell, weve had it for 50 years. [laughs] So
turns out it was
only about 43 years at that time, but
KC: So basically, you were working in Black Projects, werent you?
PP: Well, one could say that.
KC: I just have a curious question and we havent gone over this ahead
of time, so I dont know if you can even talk to this, but its not
diabolical or anything. But, Im curious because I used to love robots,
and sort of went on the Net and sort of studied, and was interested in
how far theyve progressed with all of that. One of the biggest problems
they used to have was when they wanted them to walk upright like humans
that they would fall over. How did you solve that?
PP: Well, we did it much the same way that Dean Kamen built his
two-wheeled scooter. Are you familiar with the
KC: Oh, yeah, the... what do they call that?
DW: Segway.
PP: Segway. The Segway. Its very simple to do.
KC: Which is? If you can say...
PP: Well, you simply have a sensor that senses whether youre upright or
not. And if youre not upright, then you use fuzzy logic to put it back
right.
BILL RYAN (BR): Presumably, thats the kind of stuff they put in the
F-117. It would have fallen out of the sky if it hadnt had that kind
of
PP: Yes, it would.
BR: Right.
PP: For example, the programming language that we use is called FORTH,
[spells] F-O-R-T-H. It should have been called F-O-U-R-T-H, because it
was the fourth major programming language, but in those days, computers
wouldnt take five characters, rather, six characters, so they had
F-O-R-T-H.
KC: Okay, so this kind of segues into mind control, because I also know
that you worked with SRI [Ed. note: Stanford Research Institute], and
you worked with Hal Puthoff, right? And I understand you probably knew
Ingo Swann and a lot of the people involved in remote viewing.
So, what I was wondering
I think you were involved in MK Ultra and you
can probably talk about that since its been declassified, right?
PP: Well, you can think about that all you want to think about it, and
who knows whether its true. I dont know whether thats true.
KC: All right.
PP: I know that I worked in a lot of very interesting areas.
KC: But you know that MK Ultra is declassified.
PP: I dont know anything about MK Ultra.
KC: Okay.
PP: I mean, Ive heard about it, and heard about it, and heard about it.
I dont know anything about it. I know some things that came out of it,
and I know that I researched some of those things, and I built things
that I thought were better and turned them over to the government. But
other than that, I really dont know. I actually dont know that much
about it.
KC: Okay. Is it true that youre still on call for the government?
PP: Well, Im doing things all the time that I get calls on, for a
number of different governments, actually. Im actually a member of the
Astronautics Association for Mankind, which is the Russian equivalent to
NASA. Im on the board of directors.
KC: So, why arent you on the board of directors for NASA if youre on
the Russian board?
PP: Well, mainly because I have no desire to be with a bunch of clowns.
KC: Okay...
PP: If I wanted to be with clowns, Id join a circus.
KC: So, youre really aware of the secret space program, in essence, and
you know that NASA is something of a front for
almost a distraction?
PP: I havent been associated with them for years, so I have no idea
what theyre doing.
KC: Okay, but you said NASAs a bunch of clowns. Why are you saying
that?
PP: Well, because all I have to do is look at the products they have.
KC: Why are they still
? I mean, I know theyre going to retire the
Space Shuttle any day, but its basically a tin can going up in space.
Why are they even dealing with that kind of technology at this point? Do
you know?
PP: Because they have it and it works. They've had about, maybe
It
depends on how you look at reality. They have what I consider to be
about 10% of the budget that they really ought to have.
If you look at the things that came out of the space program through
NASA, probably 50 to 60 percent of the technology we use today
throughout all industries came out of NASA: the metallurgy technology
and alloys; the temperature-resistant plastics and metals; large-scale
integrated circuits, you know, basically even the whole transistor
technology.
I worked in things like that. My cousin and I did quite a number of spy
satellites. We did the sampling arm that went on the Viking Lander to
Mars, which, by the way, was run by a FORTH-programmed computer.
So, I worked in and around that area. I worked with North American
Rockwell.
KC: JPL?
PP: JPL. A number of different places, and got to see the things that
came out of there. I got to see brand new things that were 20 years
ahead of anybody on Earth actually applied, and things that were made
from them, and they were sent into space, and they recorded things from
space. The camera that youre shooting me on, the image sensor in there
was basically made for use in outer space. Thats where they came from.
So, if you look at return on investment, there isnt a corporation ever
in the history of mankind that returned so much on the investment, even
10%, of the return on investment that came out of NASA. It literally
transformed our lives into a whole new century.
Yet they take that, which is the only success story that I think man
really has, and totally mal-funded it. Now, part of the reason was that
they wouldnt pay the appropriate amount of money to get the brainpower
that they needed. People early on worked for NASA, not because they got
paid good money, but because they got to accomplish their dream. When
finally Congress snuffled their dream, they quit working for NASA, so
now you had clowns working for NASA. It should have been a circus.
Not that there werent great people there, and not that there arent
great people there, but theyre totally frustrated, Im sure.
KC: Right. But theres also a lot of Black Projects going on under the
table.
PP: I dont know that theyre going on at NASA.
KC: Really?
PP: They may be. I dont know.
KC: What about your familiarity with things like superluminal travel?
PP: My familiarity
hmm
Well, no, I dont know anything about
superluminal travel.
KC: Well we have testimony from Henry Deacon and from Jake Simpson, a
couple of what we call whistleblowers, which, in essence, is what you
are at this point in your career, in a way.
PP: Mmm
well, in a way.
KC: Okay, youre treading a fine line.
PP: Treading a fine line. [laughs]
KC: And they are testifying that we have superluminal travel, that we
have craft that go outside the Solar System. Can you say anything about
that?
PP: I know nothing about it.
KC: Okay. You told us, or at least you talked to me at one point about
being a spymaster. Is that really true?
PP: I dont know a thing about that.
KC: Okay. Okay, well, were kind of striking out here. Where do you
think that we can go with all of this?
PP: Well, I told you the things that Im [not] willing to talk about.
[laughs] Now youre trying to get me to talk about them, and uh
KC: All right. What do you know about a UFO detector?
PP: I was asked to build a UFO detector when I was about 14, and
eventually built one.
KC: Okay. And its operational?
PP: I have no idea when its operational. The best I know, they smashed
it immediately.
KC: Whos they?
PP: The government. Actually, the President of the United States at that
time.
KC: Really? Okay.
PP: Now, heres a problem with it. Id love to do something with it.
Its a very simple, inexpensive technology.
KC: It's based on Wilhelm Reich's technology?
PP: No, it has nothing to do with Wilhelm Reich. Its based on science.
The problem with it is that it works in such a manner that it will
detect virtually every single type of thing in the universe. What that
means is that it would be the best anti-collision device that ever went
on board an airplane, because it could see every other airplane in the
sky. Thats the good news.
KC: Okay.
PP: The bad news is it can see any stealth plane just as easily as it
can see a damned dirigible.
KC: So thats why they destroyed it?
PP: I have no idea why they destroyed it.
KC: Well, can we surmise that thats why they destroyed it?
PP: I have no idea. I dont know that it was destroyed. Im just telling
you thats my feeling, because Ive never
KC: Well, you told me they took it.
PP: Ive never seen one.
KC: Well I thought you
PP: Yeah, they took it. So, what did they do with it? I dont know if
they put it in their pocket or put it in the remnants of the
Smithsonian. I dont know what happened to it. But Ive never seen one
out there in operation. I could tell if there were one in operation.
KC: But how could you tell?
PP: Because of how it works.
KC: Well, I mean
PP: Im not about to tell the secrets of it.
KC: I understand that, but you
PP: I cant talk about it without telling the secret of it.
KC: You would know if somebody was operating your device?
PP: Id know if anybody was operating one of them.
KC: How would you know that unless youre operating
PP: I would know that because of how it works.
KC: Okay, would you remote view them, or would you be
PP: No, not at all.
KC: You have a tracking device on your invention?
PP: It emits something that is absolutely unique to the device.
KC: Oh wow. Okay.
BR: Theres another kind of detector which was destroyed upon
Presidential order, I understand.
PP: Yes, there was.
BR: Are you able to talk about that? Because thats a fantastic story.
PP: Probably not. Its probably not healthy for you guys to talk about
it.
KC: Okay, well I understand that you and I dont know if you can talk
about this but my understanding is that with robots, with any kind of
device that youre operating using AI or any other kind of, as you say,
manipulator or whatever, that there sort of has to be a fail-safe or a
command override such that
You call it a gatekeeper, I believe.
PP: No, a gatekeepers a product that allows that to take place.
KC: Or not to take place.
PP: Or not to take place. And yes, theres a
Obviously its like with
atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, nuclear devices, and Cruise missiles
and whatever, one thing you dont want is your enemy to get hold of it
and use it against you. So there must-needs be some methodology to
handle that.
KC: Are you able to say that you had a hand in creating some
gatekeepers?
PP: Oh, I created gatekeepers, and whether they use it there or not, I
dont have any idea. I just know they buy a lot of gatekeepers, or
bought a lot of gatekeepers. I know that right now were in the process
of negotiating a very large order for gatekeepers what I call
gatekeepers. What theyre going to use them for, I really cant mention.
KC: Would you call yourself sort of an inventor? How would you
?
PP: I have always billed myself as an Instrument Maker.
KC: Okay.
PP: I build instruments that see things, or hear things, or measure
things that, heretofore, nobody else builds. Anybody else builds
something, I dont ever replicate it. I dont reinvent anybodys wheels,
I invent my own wheels.
KC: Okay. I want to kind of go into a different area that we havent
really addressed at the moment, and I want to know if
because
obviously, I realize theres a lot youre not talking about, and theres
some stuff that weve got off the record, and all of this kind of thing.
But, do you feel that youre protected?
PP: Yes.
KC: Do you feel youre protected on an Earthly level or on other levels
as well?
PP: Definitely on an Earthly level. I have no idea about other levels.
However, when you say feel, as compared to know, then I will tell you
that Ive had a charmed life.
KC: Okay.
PP: I can remember one time in Vietnam, standing in a firefight... And
remember that basically only machine guns fire tracer bullets. Every
fifth round, in our machine guns at least, is a tracer so the machine
gunner can aim his weapon because theyre jiggling and bouncing so much
you cant really use a sight well, so you want to see where the bullets
are going and place them where you want them. So every fifth bullet goes
out and you see a little red glow where the bullets going.
I was in firefights where the tracers were so thick it was like you were
in the middle of a 30-foot campfire that was down to the ashes, with a
weed-eater whipping up sparks. I remember about the third time, I looked
up and said: You and me, Big Al, all the way, [laughs] because I knew I
was being kept alive. There was no reason for me to be alive. Fifty
percent of the Marine officers I went to Vietnam with were killed while
they were there. They were there for 13 months; I was there for 23 or 24
months. But, anyway...
KC: And to this day, you feel that youre protected?
PP: Well, Ive been in other places that were even scarier than that.
And Ive done crazy things all my life, to invent things fast rather
than slow, and take it the hard way instead of the easy way, and so
forth, and somehow lived through all of it.
You know, I get the biggest kick today out of
some kids spilled a
little tiny bottle of mercury in a town nearby, and they came and dug an
Olympic swimming pool in their front yard and hauled all the dirt off,
and charged them thousands and thousands of dollars to get rid of the
mercury. Hell, I used to spill two or three ounces of mercury a day in
my lab, which was down in a basement, and the only thing it did,
probably, is drop my IQ by 30 or 40 points, but
KC: But that didnt really matter, considering how high it is.
PP: I used to go around with a piece of lead solder hanging out of my
mouth. I must have spent 20 years with a piece of solder sticking out of
the corner of my mouth, getting that good lead. All that did was drop my
IQ another 10 or 20 points.
KC: [laughs]
PP: So, yeah, Ive been charmed.
KC: Okay. Have you been threatened?
PP: Oh, yeah. Ive been threatened a number of times, by just about
every kind of person that would want to threaten me.
BR: You can make a joke about Bastard School as well. Thats a good one.
KC: Well, that was what I was trying to get to, but
BR: You can talk about Bastard School.
DW: A.K.A. Terrorism School.
KC: Can we talk about Bastard School at all?
PP: Well, yeah.
KC: Okay. And what was your experience with that?
PP: Well, I call it Bastard School. When I was an officer in the
military, very obvious, I was trained in military things. I was taught
to be the biggest S.O.B. on the block. I got so good at it, they finally
turned around and had me do some other things, because it scared them to
death. Because I was a mean, green, killing machine.
So, instead of teaching terroristic things, they had me teach anti-terroristic
things. Then they in both cases one, they were afraid that the enemy
would learn what I was doing that was nasty; then they thought the enemy
might learn what I was doing to disrupt being nasty. So then they moved
me on to other things.
KC: Youve dealt with mind control in some ways, in some fashions. You
know something about the mind, clearly, and about this information
field. Im wondering if theres something within the information field
and/or the mind-body interaction that can be set up to protect oneself
against, lets say, mind control devices such as the digital television
that is now projecting you know, able to communicate with people in
their houses and so on, so forth.
PP: Well, thats an assumption that were making.
KC: Right. Im making that assumption, not you. So Im just asking is
there something, some technique?
PP: There are things that were designed specifically. As an example, in
the probably, 80s, the Russians had a thing that was... because it
sounded like a woodpecker on the shortwave radio, was called the
Woodpecker.
They had three large locations that were transmitting probably several
million watts per location, and they were phased in a particular area,
so they could move where the peak of that electromagnetic wave would
fall. It turns out that one of the places here they had it fall was in a
town called Eugene, Oregon.
People there were getting sunburns while they slept at night, and they
were getting headaches, and they were having birth defects and so forth.
The Woodpecker had a very strong signal there and a highly interfering
signal. It was also at a psycho-active frequency, so that it would
disrupt the appropriate thinking capabilities of the brain.
KC: This is all documented, by the way, on the Net.
PP: Oh yeah. Its all documented on the Net. Also, a good friend of mine
was the man who discovered they were bombarding the Moscow Embassy with
microwaves that had much the same frequency content.
So, there was a fellow that designed a little device that you could wear
under the collar, which was provided to all of our personnel that we
needed to make sure had clear thinking, that they could carry with them
and it would send a signal, a close-by signal... remembering that
electromagnetic waves decrease with the cube of the distance. After a
very short distance, the signals very, very weak.
So you put a weak signal near the person, and drive their mind into a
range of brainwaves that would be benign or even, hopefully, beneficial.
They found a very simple way to find out what was beneficial, and then a
very simple way to tune the device so that it would put those waves out.
They were carried by all types of diplomats and military personnel for
years and years and years.
KC: So, we can assume that the president and various people are using
these devices to this day?
PP: I would certainly think they would be. I know that I carry one
around.
KC: Okay, and youre saying this person who invented it
youre saying
youre not the person who invented it?
PP: I didnt say anything about it.
KC: Okay. But theres also a technique involved, such that one can do it
without the device if one learns?
PP: Yeah, you can learn to hold your mind pretty much in whatever mode
you want.
KC: It has to do with the informational field, is that right?
PP: No, it doesnt. It has to do with the electromagnetic field.
KC: Oh, really?
PP: Yep.
KC: So you use your mind to affect the electromagnetic field?
PP: No. You just use your mind to generate its own electromagnetic field
at a benign frequency, or even a helpful frequency.
KC: To counter it?
PP: To counteract it. Ill give you an example. You get three or four
people that are very close, or two people that are even closer, and what
youll get is youll get heartbeat synchronization which just occurs
and then youll get brainwave synchronization. Then, unfortunately, or
fortunately, depending on the situation, you get hormone production, and
hormones are very, very powerful messengers, and then you get into
trouble, [laughs] or not.
KC: Its a form of entrainment, right?
PP: Its a form of entrainment, and you get an entrainment. So, a very
weak signal can give you great entrainment.
Nicola Tesla made a device that used compressed air, and it was a little
weight. He could stick that on the ground outside of a skyscraper in New
York and this thing would sense ground-wave oscillations and tune itself
to them.
So, it would start out very rapidly and slow down, and then it would
find where it was affecting the environment. It would resonate with it.
Its like if you have a wineglass here and you play your violin up
scale, eventually youll find where if you stop real quick, youll hear
the wineglass vibrating. Then if you play that note exactly, pretty soon
the wineglass will break, because
just a little bit
Its like pushing
a swing. If you push the swing in phase, the swing will go way high. If
you push it out of phase, itll stop, it wont go very high, itll go
high, and then low - a number of things. You want to get it resonant or
in phase.
So, thats what Teslas device would do. It would move a weight up and
down, up and down, up and down using pneumatic pressure and pneumatic
valving, and hed make a skyscraper just wag like a dogs tail... in New
York.
KC: So, isnt this like sort of the kernel behind mind control? Getting
a very slow resonance set up, and then affecting it one way or another?
No?
PP: No, no
no. Doesnt have much to do with mind control. But part of
what you want to do, perhaps, with mind control, is get your mind in a
certain frequency. But thats old-style mind control. What you want to
do now... Basically, if you want to look at neuro-linguistic
programming, using the principles of neuro-linguistic programming is
much more powerful than getting a brainwave entrainment.
Brainwave entrainment will drop the IQ, itll drop the attention span,
itll change the memory, so there are a number of things that can be
done there. But, what we use now is a thing that changes the way the
brain is attached to itself, and the way the brain hooks together, and
we just change the neural pathways.
You can cause a person to forget; you can cause a person to do things
that they have no intention of doing. You can make a stimulus that would
cause one thing, like a stimulus that would cause me to reach out and
grab some water and take a drink because I was thirsty; you can very
quickly and easily change that stimulus to when I get thirsty, Ill
reach out and grab a glass of water and pour it down my neck, pour it
down the front of my suit.
KC: So, what about the idea that you were telling us about the piece of
the heart? You could cut off a piece of the heart and give it to
somebody who would recognize it a doctor who would recognize it as a
part of the brain, or have resonance on the
PP: It would appear to be brain tissue.
KC: And this is a medical fact, right?
PP: Its a medical fact. Theres a very good book that anyone who has a
child that doesnt read this book, should be jailed. [Kerry laughs] Im
serious. Its called The Magical Child by Joseph Chilton Pearce,
[spells] P-E-A-R-C-E, and he has follow-up books on it. For example, The
Magical Child Matures tells you why that no center-city, fatherless
child is ever going to amount to anything, ever. They cant because
their brain doesnt form properly.
KC: Really?
PP: Yep.
KC: A fatherless child?
PP: Well, or motherless.
KC: An orphan.
PP: A child thats raised outside of a normal family environment, lets
put it that way. Thats much more accurate. Itll tell you why that
cant happen, why they cant really become useful to society.
KC: Well, is this the thing you were telling us about the heart? Being
close to the heart?
PP: Its part of it, thats part of it; thats just part of it. There
are a number of different factors. But one of the things that Pearce
writes about in The Magical Child is, for example, that during the first
16 days or so after the amniotic fluid breaks, the child is exposed to
the electromagnetic field from the mothers heart beating, and that
field is modulated by whats in the brain cells in the heart, which are
the emotions, and those emotions are transferred to the child.
So, they thought: Well that may be true. They went to Europe, where a
lot of women have their children raised by wet nurses who nurse them on
their breast, and they find out that the child takes on the emotional
content of the wet nurse. Or children who are raised without a father
never get the emotional the male emotions from the father, as
compared to the female emotions.
KC: But youre saying it happens in the first 16 days, after that
PP: The greater part of it happens in the first 16 to 18 days.
KC: Incredible.
PP: It turns out, for example, the Russians did brilliant and massive
research on this. They found out that if the child is born underwater in
a fluid remember, the childs already in a fluid, it isnt going to
hurt him to be underwater for a while. The childs born under water in
the fluid about body temperature and moved up, with contact with the
mother, to the breast.
Where, if you look at how you would naturally hold your arms and nurture
a child, the heart of the mother and the heart of the child are going to
be right next to each other. The child starts picking things up. If the
child is kept in that position for the first 12 to 14 hours, the child
usually develops speech by six months of age and is able to stand on
their own at six months of age.
KC: Can you talk about that Russian doctor?
PP: I
unfortunately
I could if I remembered his name. I cant remember
his name. He was brought to the United States... I can tell you that his
techniques were used by Madonna in having her children.
BR: We were talking about generating an IQ as high as 275 in the
children.
PP: Right. I can tell you that her children are some of the most
brilliant children on the face of the Earth because of that. I know that
she worked using those techniques for a year to a year and a half before
they were conceived, just to become ready. That could well be privileged
information, but it leaked out to me, and I know it to be true.
DW: So youre saying that the heart has an information field component,
which somehow entrains the formation of the nervous system?
PP: No, Im not saying anything about the information field. Im saying
the heart has an electromagnetic component that is there because the
heart beats and it takes a large electrical current to beat the heart.
DW: Okay.
PP: The body is bioelectric. Anything near a magnetic field or an
electric field thats conductive, then, has components that come from
the things around it that are electric or magnetic or conductive.
KC: Okay.
PP: So, you can see that stuff in the heart field. The information not
the information field the information transfers to the just like
programming a ROM chip transfers to the heart of the child.
As an example, one of the final proofs of this is: There was a man who
absolutely hated the odor, the sight and the taste of mustard, and got a
heart transplant, and all of a sudden, couldnt get enough mustard. Just
by happenstance, the wife of the donor somehow got word to him that her
husband loved mustard. So he had the heart; that came along with it.
A number of people were, in essence, SOBs, or were very tense
individuals and they got a heart from a man who was a very calm man, and
all of a sudden, their wife and their children didnt even know who they
were. They were a completely different person.
That information was encoded in there, and when the nerves were sewn
together and some of them grew back, that information got out of the
heart. It may well be that the magnetic field of the heart transmitted,
and the brain picked it up.
I dont know that. But, I know that we instrumented peoples hearts and
would let them see things that would excite them. The heart rate picks
up, adrenalins produced; maybe what they see causes anger or fear. And
if you anesthetize that part of the heart, then they dont have those
fears and those angers, and so forth.
So, that emotional information and some things like preferences in
flavor, or color are transferred and transmitted in there. So, its very
important to get the child up into a nurturing position. Children who
were nurtured by both mother and father have both male and female
components. Children nurtured by one or the other have only the one
component of their emotional make-up.
BR: And its the first 16 days that does it, is that right?
PP: Well, read the book. The greater part of it occurs in the first 16
to 18 days. And yes, maybe thats 30%. Maybe another 10% occurs in the
next 50 days; maybe another 10% in the next 180 days.
KC: Okay, but very early on as opposed to later...
PP: Very early on. You want to get that in there very early on.
KC: Okay. I want to go in another direction.
DW: Wait a minute is there any other tissue in the body, besides the
heart, that acts like neurological tissue?
PP: Oh, absolutely. Now, if you want, you can call the pineal part of
the brain. Even though it doesnt do brain function, its part of the
brain. The pineal and pituitary are mostly a substance called melanin. A
type of melanin makes the skin pigment, but theyre a slightly different
kind of melanin.
I, in my research, have found that the melanin in the pineal which, in
Eastern medicine is the third eye, the seat of the third eye is very,
very, very good at picking up informational signals and adding a time
content to them, thus subtracting a non-time content, so its always
been attributed to clairvoyance, clairaudience and so forth. Those are
signals that are taken out of a signal that appears to be everywhere,
every-when. It coheres that for the person and they have certain
abilities that they wouldnt have.
The Tibetans drill a hole in the front of the forehead with a little
rock drill, and then they poke a bamboo skewer in and manipulate the
pineal to open the third eye. What it does is it gives it a hole
through the Faraday Cage, speaking in science terms, and it makes a
sensitivity by making a piece of scar tissue that opens up, or opens the
third eye, or opens clairvoyance or clairaudience, or remote viewing, or
remote influencing, or a number of different things.
KC: Isnt it true that fluoride deadens or hardens the pineal gland?
PP: Absolutely, but what it mostly hardens
KC: And since we have fluoride in our water, basically you could look at
that as an Illuminati plot to deaden the intelligence and the psychic
ability of the population.
PP: What I try to do, as a scientist, is stay to scientific things. I
dont presume about what the Illuminati want to do.
KC: Okay.
PP: But, I can tell you that the main thing that halides which are
chlorine, fluorine, bromine mainly what they do in the body is congeal
cholesterol into arterial plaque. I mean, thats well known.
KC: So, it slows down the blood flow in the arteries.
PP: Yeah, it closes down the arteries. So there are many ways to
sterilize water other than chlorine and fluorine. There are many ways,
for example, they say: Well, we use fluorine for tooth decay.
You have a whole fleet of boats up and down the West Coast of the United
States and the East Coast of the United States that cant fish anymore,
because weve killed all the fish, except there are bottom-feeders
called... I wont tell you the name of the fish, but theyre bottom
feeders. Thats a fish that consists of... 60% of the weight of the fish
is liver, and about 60% of the liver is that particular fish liver oil,
which contains a compound called Activator X by Price of the Price-Pottenger
Foundation of years-ago fame.
He found out right after World War II that one drop of that... Well, you
can take that fish oil, which is highly-fishy-tasting. Get it cold; the
waxes and false isomers will solidify. You can filter those out and the
oil left over has very little or no taste to it. That oil, you can put
in the sunlight and it wont turn rancid for hundreds of years. It
should have been used in place of sperm whale oil for lubricating
watches, but they didnt use it for that.
KC: Is this cod liver oil?
PP: No, its not cod liver oil. Its a different oil, but those boats
could go out and bring back boatloads of this fish. It grows from
Antarctica to [the] Arctic and everywhere in between.
KC: What does that have to do with fluoride in the water?
PP: What it has to do with is that that oil, one drop put in a slice of
bread eaten daily and you [will] have no caries whatsoever; theres
no tooth decay. It eliminates tooth decay. And they did this on
thousands and hundreds of thousands of children in Europe after World
War Two.
KC: And likewise you can guard against hardening of the arteries.
PP: Well, then you dont get the hardening of the arteries from the
fluoride or the chloride. Now, what happened was... and Ill take the
hit for this, lets put it that way. Its my conjecture that the only
reason we use chloride in the water was because the politicians have
already spent all of the Social Security money, so youve got to have
something there so that people die at retirement age.
KC: [laughs]
PP: Then because of health care getting better, we had to have something
else that made it happen even faster, so we put fluoride in the water.
KC: Wow. That's something.
PP: They could have gotten rid of tooth decay with an absolutely benign
substance that we had a whole industry here that could go out and bring
us back all we could ever use for the whole world, very inexpensively
and totally non-negatively in the body. But we didnt do that.
Now, the reason that that fish oil doesnt turn rancid is, obviously,
because its an antioxidant. Its the best antioxidant known to man as
far as I know. Price called it Activator X. It has a definite chemical
formula. It could definitely be put out there. But itd eliminate most
of heart surgery; it would eliminate tooth decay, so its not put out
there because that isnt efficient in our capitalistic system.
KC: Well, youre talking worldwide though, as well, right?
PP: Yeah, it would be worldwide. Like I say, we did it in Europe after
World War II, for years, but we took that Activator X... By the way,
theres a small amount of it in wheat germ oil, so that was taken from
wheat germ oil. Now we found I found the ratfish had this stuff in,
you know, massive amounts.
BR: When you said Price, did you mean Dr. Weston Price?
PP: Weston Price, yeah. So its my conjecture theyre only
I mean the
only reason I could see that we would be using that is to kill people
off. Why else would you do that?
DW: You're saying, about the pineal gland. Because I have a whole long
section in my video that everybodys seen, most of this audience has
seen it, all about the pineal gland. So, youre saying that this oil, if
taken, would help to decalcify the pineal gland, or somehow increase its
sensitivity?
PP: If the pineal gland is calcified by halides, yes it would.
DW: Okay.
KC: But youre not naming the fish.
PP: I wasnt really naming the fish.
KC: Other than the ratfish that you just talked about?
PP: No. And thats not the
KC:
not the main source.
PP: No, thats what its called in certain areas of the world.
KC: Hmm. Okay. But I was curious. You said something about, you know,
theres camps being built around the United States. Do you know the
purpose behind them?
PP: Yes. Theyre camps to detain people.
KC: Is this something that goes on the tail-end
because Im looking for
the agenda that goes behind the crash of the dollar, that basically
youre saying is coming at some point in the near future, quite
possibly. Right? Thats what your sources are telling you?
PP: I think thats a great possibility. Im planning for it.
KC: Okay. And then, on top of it, there are camps being built, and you
can verify that?
PP: Well, theyre giving tours of some of them, and you go on the
Internet and youll find out that there are a number of locations where
people say: Well, heres a camp thats built.
KC: Okay, and what about the role of viruses in eliminating the
population? Is there any validity to that?
PP: I have no idea. Its not my area of expertise. I have suppositions.
KC: Well you clearly are a healer, so have you got advice on how people
can protect themselves from viruses?
PP: Well, I think all that advice is available if you just download it
from the FDA websites or the various websites of, say, FEMA and Homeland
Security.
KC: Really?
PP: Oh, absolutely. Wear a mask, wash your hands; theyre absolutely
correct.
KC: Okay.
PP: Another good thing to do is go someplace [where] theres not a lot
of people. Were sitting here filming in an area that theres not a lot
of people. The town says Entering the Town on one side of the sign, and
on the other side of the signpost, it says Exiting the Town, and 1st
Streets in some great big city somewhere else, because [laughs] theres
not another street.
KC: [laughs] Okay. Well, so what is it that you think is coming in the
future in terms of... Lets talk about outer space a little bit. Do you
think that theres anything out there that we need to be aware of?
PP: Well, I think therere all kinds of things out there [that] we need
to be aware of.
KC: Okay. I mean, is the only threat... In other words, is the only
threat
PP: Well its a major threat that we right now dont have any deterrent
for.
KC: What threat?
PP: A threat from outside the planetary bounds.
KC: Well, what about the satellites that have recently been classified,
such that they wont tell us about incoming bodies? Thats all
classified suddenly.
PP: Well, that I dont know about. I didnt realize that had been done,
but if its been done, its obviously been done for some reason. And
that reason may be to stop panic.
I know the government has a tremendous belief in: Whatever you do, dont
cause panic in the people. Because, when you cause panic in the people,
then it draws attention to the lawmakers, the Senate, the Congress, the
Presidency, and the ruling party. And theyre not looking...
You know, its like the old Chinese curse: May you live in interesting
times. You know, try to live in times that are not at all interesting;
theyre boring as hell - nothings going to happen.
So, I think that anything that might happen that would cause people to
start thinking about: Well, why isnt something being done here? Were
out of money. Weve been out of money for years. So we dont have money
to go do anything about it, so why let the people worry?
KC: Okay, but you were telling me something about the fact that you
think theres really only ten months left for the, sort of, rollout of
what could be, like, reversing the agenda. I mean, I dont even know if
you believe its possible to reverse the agenda thats being rolled out
at the moment. Youve said weve got about ten months, because the
Earth... weve polluted our own nest.
PP: Okay. Herere just a few things that you can look up, and the things
I talk about are things that are openly available on the Internet;
Library of Congress or a lot of things now on YouTube; a lot of things
on, you know, Ask.com and Google.com, and so forth. You can go in there
and start making searches, and looking, and you can find a lot of
information. Theres a tremendous amount of information.
KC: About?
PP: About the things that you just spoke about, and specifically you can
find out that oh, its about a couple weeks ago, we just had a very
near flyby of a huge asteroid that wouldve caused, depending on where
it hit, thousands, if not millions of deaths on the Earth, if it had hit
the Earth. And it was a near flyby.
Now, maybe that nearness was 100,000 miles, but 100,000 miles is sure
different than the distance between here and Mars, or here and Pluto. It
came by very close. It could have been one of those things that hit the
Earth, and we have nothing to stop something like that.
KC: Okay, youre saying we have nothing to stop something. Is it
possible black people in black projects have something to stop that?
[Ed. note: no reference to African-Americans intended]
PP: No, I dont believe so.
KC: Okay, and what about...
PP: If they did, I dont believe theyve had the money to build it.
KC: And what about positive aliens? Do you think that they might
interfere with something of that nature?
PP: Well, if there are such things as positive aliens, I think that,
yeah. You know, I wonder. I look at Earth, and I look at the things
weve done to destroy this fragile little spaceship that we live on
going through space. You know, we talk about burning, we talk badly
about all the burning of the rainforests in Brazil, and yet most of the
oxygens produced by plankton.
Our use of nickel-cadmium batteries, and lead batteries, and putting
them out into the environment has killed a good part of the plankton.
Cetaceans are beaching themselves so that theres enough food left for
the others.
KC: Because theyre that wise. And self-sacrificial.
PP: Well I think that they are, and of course, you had to have worked
with them in some of the military programs to understand how wise they
are.
KC: Okay, well Im going to have to wind this up. I would love to talk
to you all night and all day, and especially if you were able to come
out with some of the more fascinating things that youre involved in.
But Project Camelot wants to thank you very much. I want to thank you
for your service to humanity. Youve clearly been involved in some
things that are healing for the population out there. Youre here,
trying to testify to something coming that you firmly believe that
people need to be aware of, and so I want to thank you.
PP: I appreciate your interest anything that can get information out
to the people. And my suggestion to the people is... because this stuff
is not really hidden. It may be squirreled away somewhere, but its
there, and you can go out and find the information for yourself.
My suggestion is you do it. My suggestion is that you prepare yourself
for an emergency, because no matter what you do in life, youre going to
run into an emergency. If you prepare yourself for it, then you stand a
very good chance of surviving it, and if you dont prepare yourself for
it, you stand a very good chance of not surviving it.
KC: Okay. Thank you, and Pete Peterson, I really want to thank you
again. Bill, you want to say any closing words yourself?
BR: I think this is the most important interview weve ever done.
KC: Okay, and David, you got anything you want to add to that?
DW: Well, Pete, I just want to say I appreciate your courage for
inviting us out here. I think that the data that youve given about the
consciousness and the information field is really instrumental in my
work, and I hope we can continue that discussion.
PP: Well, I think that well probably continue a relationship for a long
time, and Im perfectly willing to share that information. Im at a
point in my life that the only thing I can do now to make my life
worthwhile is to share the wisdom that Ive obtained as a stone rolling
through this interesting experience of life on Earth.
[music fades in]
PP:
been involved with trying to build flying saucers, you usually
found that with flying saucers, if you look at most of the movies, there
always seems to be a robot involved with it...
