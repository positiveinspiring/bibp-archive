WikiLeaks, facing criticism after unredacted
versions of
diplomatic cables escaped into the wild, today
accused a Guardian journalist of
negligently publishing the password required to decrypt them.
A Guardian journalist has negligently
disclosed top secret WikiLeaks decryption passwords to hundreds of
thousands of unredacted unpublished US diplomatic cables.
Knowledge of the Guardian disclosure has spread privately over several
months but reached critical mass last week. The unpublished WikiLeaks
material includes over 100,000 classified unredacted cables that were
being analyzed, in parts, by over 50 media and human rights
organizations from around the world.
For the past month WikiLeaks has been in the unenviable position of not
being able to comment on what has happened, since to do so would be to
draw attention to the decryption passwords in the Guardian book.
Now that the connection has been made public
by others we can explain what happened and what we intend to do.
Wikileaks also says it is in touch with the U.S.
State Department and will be
taking legal action.
UPDATE
The Guardian, in a story about the availability
of the unredacted cables,
denies that its journalist disclosed the
password.
But further down in the story it seems to admit it, instead blaming
WikiLeaks for letting it do so:
"Our book about WikiLeaks was published last
February. It contained a password, but no details of the location of the
files, and we were told it was a temporary password which would expire
and be deleted in a matter of hours."
Interesting! Now you may go and check the
timelines again to find out when certain password-protected files might have
left Wikileaks' exclusive custody. Go right ahead!
No-one's going anywhere.
UPDATE
the book passage in question may be
read at Google books. Just like that, for
all the world to see, since the day it was published.
