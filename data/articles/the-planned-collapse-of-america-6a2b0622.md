There is no shortage of speculation about "why"
our leaders are still adamantly planning for the destruction of Iran, in the
face of overwhelming popular opposition, even though everyone except the
neocons and their allies believes that America would not survive our own
actions. An irrational attack is planned and apparently the decision has
been chiseled in stone. It may be for Israel. It may be for oil...
Maybe it is for world domination?
We are launching a nuclear world war to save us from ourselves.
"We have found the enemy and he is us."
Pogo
We risk blowing the world apart, to avoid
watching America slowly choke on its own excesses.
The government has known for decades that America is on a countdown to
self-destruction. Among the elite it is common knowledge that our "global
economy" must one day collapse from its own dead weight. In 1974 an
intensive research project was undertaken by the
Stanford Research Institute and the
Charles F. Kettering Foundation for the Department of Education.
Their final report was released as the
Changing Images of Man (see below insert.)
It was compiled by the
SRI Center for the Study of Social Policy,
Director Willis Harmon.
This is a far-reaching investigation into how
the basic nature of man might be changed. The
Aquarian Conspiracy describes the implementation of their work in
the real world.
The most reassuring part of "Images" is that it confirms my own conclusions
about our crisis, but it is also the most disturbing part, for it confirms
my worst reservations about this time.
The object of the research was the development of a plausible vision of the
future in which democratic methods survive, major problems are managed
successfully if not resolved, and the unfolding of the human potential
continues to expand. In other words, the postulation of a "desirable future"
including feasible paths to its realization...
The government was looking forward to a very troubling future, trying to
figure out the best path through it. The plan was to find ways to shape and
mold mankind into a new cultural image, complete with new ideas and
ideologies, even religious ones. The root of the problem was human nature,
and solution was to reshape the competing forces of daily life, in order to
forge a new image of a new human nature.
The researchers were brutally honest in seeking
all available knowledge pertaining to their research, and in assessing the
current common image of man-on-earth.
The research revealed that there were a multitude of crises that were about
to intersect in America's near future. Not the least of these converging
catastrophes was a rapidly approaching breakdown of both American capitalism
and democracy. The collapse was a natural result of globalism and monopoly
capitalism.
The basic greed that powers the system eroded
the American political and economic structures, exposing the foundation of
immorality and unfairness that amplifies the social unrest. The Stanford
researchers clearly predicted that the
American economy was destined to collapse from its own dead
weight. The data also showed that that economic collapse was to be
accompanied by disastrous social repercussions, such as rioting and
upheaval, which would lead us into a "garrison state."
The thing about this research is that this work has confirmed that our
economy based on parasitic capitalism, where the small elite sits
atop the heap of men and gorges on their lifeblood, is destroying the social
fabric of America. This system is based on a stacked deck, where the top
elite always reap the profits that are made to rise to the top through the
corporate profits-based system. The research confirmed that the growing
inequities of such a system were ever increasing and with them, elevated
social tensions.
A system based on usury and putting
everyone in the "poor house" is an economic order that is guaranteed to
produce a democratic revolution, whenever the misery index of the armed
populace exceeds the limits that they are willing to peacefully bear,
without striking back at the source of their misery.
Changing Images of Man
predicts an American economic collapse and a "garrison (police)
state," if the overwhelming inequities of our economic system are not
corrected by powerful multinationals making more humane decisions.
Alternatives to this doomsday scenario are
discussed, all of which point to the need to devote all available resources
towards transforming the image of man, changing man's nature, instead of
altering the corrupted economic system which has brought America to this
dire state. In this government study it was inappropriate to denounce the
evil culprits behind all our troubles (who pull the strings on government
itself), even though the task was to document and remedy the damage that
they have done.
Instead, they are cited as the hopeful
"saviors," that we should look to for help and leadership. The hypocrisy of
the hegemons!
The authors admit that it is,
"utopian in 1974 to think of the
multinational corporations as potentially among our most effective
mechanisms for husbanding the earth's resources and optimizing their use
for human benefit - the current popular image of the corporation tends
to be more that of the spoiler and the exploiter."
Instead of charging the people who are
responsible for our situation (such as men like
David Rockefeller), for manipulating
our economy and our democracy to maximize their profits, the
multi-national corporations and their owners were exalted as the potential
saviors of mankind. Rockefeller and
the
elite have consistently taken steps to dominate the world by
controlling people through "humanitarian" projects which, in the end, turn
out to be profit mechanisms.
The "green revolution" to spread corporate
farming to the Third World has been the key to
globalization's destabilizing of world
labor markets, in order to create populations of "refugee workers," who are
willing to go anywhere to find work for slave wages.
This is the cause of the wave of illegal
immigration into the US from Mexico. This is part of the proof that there
are powerful individuals who are using their economic power to undermine
nations in a long-term scheme to gain control of nations and multiply their
profits.
Here David Rockefeller
admits media collusion with his one world plans:
"We are grateful to the Washington Post, the
New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose
directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of
discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us
to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the light
of publicity during those years.
But now the world is more sophisticated and
prepared to march towards a world government. The supra-national
sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely
preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past
centuries."
Rockefeller writes on page 405 of his memoirs:
"Some even believe we are part of a secret
cabal working against the best interests of the United States,
characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring
with others around the world to build a more integrated global political
and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that is the charge,
I stand guilty, and I am proud of it."
(Activists
Go Face to Face With Evil As Rockefeller Confronted)
Everything that "Images" suggested to remedy
shortcomings in the economic system was based on the assumption that men
like this would acquire a new corporate benevolence, with CEOs gaining basic
humanity. According to Rockefeller himself (who freely admits his efforts to
replace America with a "one world" order), he has been working for the
greater good of man, all along.
Their conclusions on American political shortcomings were that these would
be tended to by the new improved humane politicians, sort of like Bush's
"compassionate conservatives."
Step 4 of their six-part strategy to "Bring
About a Non-Catastrophic Transformation",
"Encourage a politics of righteousness and a
heightened sense of public responsibilities of the private sector... A
politics of righteousness might have been laudable in any generation; it
may be indispensable for safe passage through the times just ahead."
The report authors recognize the inevitability
of the rising new image of man, describing it as a quasi-religious awakening
within the collective mind of man, man's new human nature, relating it to
the actual process of spiritual learning that has been going on within
religions for thousands of years.
They praise
Freemasonry
and the skills and disciplines inculcated within its members, speculating
that their ways might be the key to shoring-up our free enterprise
democratic society.
They developed a strategy to revitalize America's motivational images,
symbols and institutions, outlining five separate approaches to the problem,
describing the pluses and the pitfalls of each, according to their effects
upon society. These approaches are defined as "restorative, simulative,
manipulative, persuasive and facilitative."
Restoration of crumbling icons works best in the
early stages of societal transformation (revitalization cycle). The
simulative strategy introduces new ideas, whenever the collapse of the old
order becomes apparent. The manipulative strategy seeks to limit
individual freedoms.
Persuasive propaganda phase is to be coupled
with proven mind control techniques, to keep down the social upheaval and
shape the emerging image.
"No doubt existing consciousness-changing,
behavior-shaping, subliminal persuasion, and other conditioning
techniques could be used to accomplish some sort of transformation of
sobering proportions (we ought to be able to be more effective than Nazi
Germany). After previously citing Nazi reinvigoration of the Germanic
icons and ideals."
The transforming revitalization process mirrors
the psychiatric process of leading a patient through a psychotic break and
the restructuring of his life, but on a national scale.
Once the transformation becomes apparent, social stability will become a
problem, especially when society feels pushed by overextending the
simulative stage. Actions taken to increase the polarization between
"transformation enthusiasts and the conservatives" are called
"constructive," except when it is desirable to take actions that "contribute
to social cohesion."
They were searching for the best path to bring
about a controlled deconstruction of everything that "America" means and the
reconstruction of a new improved vision of America. They are midwifes to the
delivery of the "New World
Order," as they go about the dirty business of guiding society
through that predicted period of "friendly fascism."
The great anomaly is given as the great chasm between an efficiently
functioning profit-driven capitalist society and the human needs and desires
of that society which go unmet, so that "profits" can be taken. In fact, the
"profit" really amounts to the bread that is taken from the poor. The
inequities and the unfairness of the corporate system are causing the
breakdown of American capitalism and American democracy.
The
American catastrophe is
causing the breakdown of the world economy for the same reason, the
basic inability of monopoly capitalism to meet the basic needs demanded by
the world's people.
Bush's
appointed task is to bully America through this turbulent period of
upheaval, with as little disruption of corporate activity as possible.
Government has taken the words of this study to heart, preparing a
manipulative transformation, to divert or preempt the coming collapse of our
nation with a massive war today. This is also one of the primary reasons for
the coming world war, to serve as a
prelude to American
martial law.
Instead of calling out the troops after the
insurrection has begun, they plan to call out the troops first.
If the American military is to forcefully
control the homeland, including their own relatives, then the troops must
first be convinced that the nation's survival depends upon their patriotic
actions. This is why the world
war against Iran has not started yet, because our National Guard must
first be convinced that its duty is to put down the American rebellion which
will surely accompany the bombing of Iran. The timing for their great
takeover is crucial, if they want to move America past (through) the social
unrest as quickly as possible.
Here are the "Elements
of a Strategy for a Non-catastrophic Transition":
-
Promote awareness of the unavoidability
of the transformation.
-
Foster construction of a guiding vision
of a workable society built around the new image of man and new
social paradigm.
-
Foster a period of experimentation and
tolerance for diverse alternatives.
-
Encourage a politics of righteousness
and a heightened sense of public responsibilities of the private
sector... A politics of righteousness might have been laudable in
any generation; it may be indispensable for safe passage through the
times just ahead.
-
Promote systematic exploration of and
foster education regarding man's inner life, his subjective
experience.Plan adequate social controls for the transition period
while safeguarding against longer-term losses of freedom...
Regulation and restraint of behavior will be necessary in order to
hold the society together while it goes around a difficult corner.
There must be a new economics to deal with the
"new scarcities."
Arguing for corporate America to adopt a
humanitarian aspect, the argument is made for an alternative "new
socialism," where important sectors like energy might be nationalized for
the good of the country, and greater pressure put upon corporations to
mandate a sort of social awareness of employee needs, as much as shareholder
profits.
"The appropriate question may be not so much
how to bring about a transformation... but rather how to facilitate a
non-catastrophic transformation."
[page 195]
"Construct a guiding version of a workable society, built around a new
positive image of humankind and corresponding vision of a suitable
social paradigm. As the old order shows increasing signs of falling
apart, some adequate vision of what may be simultaneously building is
urgently needed for mobilization of constructive effort.
The guiding vision has to include some way
of providing for full and valued participation in the economic and
social affairs of the community and society, especially for those who
are physically and mentally able to contribute but find themselves in a
state of unwilling idleness and deterioration of spirit."
Despite all the report's shortcomings and its
hypocrisy, it does make some sound observations about what is needed for our
immediate survival.
We should take it as a guide to what our
government knows about
the coming mega-crisis and a template to
help us see what changes we could make if there were truly a new economy, a
new social contract, a new American state. For it is obvious to all those
who take the time to look, that we are headed into period of national
freefall, when American society plunges head first, into a dark abyss of
uncertainty, as the old order passes away, and the New World Order
rushes in to fill the void.
We are seeing the planned collapse of America, coming down the road
we are on.
What are we going to do to get our nation off
that highway to hell?
