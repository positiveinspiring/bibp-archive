"Iraq for Sale - The War Profiteers" is a 2006 documentary about the ongoing
Iraq War and the behavior of companies with no-bid contracts working within
Iraq.
The film claims four major contractors who
over-bill the government (and by extension, the American public), doing
substandard work while endangering the lives of American soldiers as well as
private citizens.
The documentary contends these companies are
composed of ex-military and ex-government workers who unethically help their
companies get and keep enormous contracts and milk the American taxpayer.
