Chapter Thirteen
Shell programming, Internal Councils, Human
Experimentation, Function Codes
Parts of this chapter could be extremely triggering, please read with
caution and only with a therapist if a survivor.
Shell programming is a form of programming used to create a “shell”
on the outside, that other alters inside speak through. This is a designed
to hide the person’s multiplicity from the outside world, and
works extremely well with highly fragmented systems. It also takes a
person with the ability to dissociate to a great degree.
How it is done: with shell programming, the trainer will often take
a clear plastic or glass mask, and put it in front of the subject. They
will be extremely traumatized, shocked, drugged, and told that they
(the alter or alters in front) are the “mask” that they
see. Their job will be to be a shell, or voice, to cover for the others
behind. These parts will be so traumatized that they literally see themselves
as only a shell, with no real substance or body.
Others inside will then be directed to come next to the “shell”
alters, and use their voice to cover their own. This allows greater
fragmentation of the person, while being able to hide it from outside
view, since the internal alters will learn to present through the shell.
Shell alters always see themselves as “clear”, and will
have no color if color coding is present in other systems.
Suggestions
It is important to realize that what the system is actually doing is
co-presenting, although not co-consciously. For a shell program to work,
the shell alters have been taught to allow co-presentation with the
other alters in the systems. Other alters in the back may not always
be aware that this is what is happening, and the front shell especially
will not know that they are being “gone through” for co-presentation.
Recognizing the trauma that occurred, and finding out where the shell
fragments came from, will help. Allowing both the shell alters and the
other alters to recognize that this is how they have been presenting,
and why, will be an important step. Back alters may then begin presenting
without going through the shell, and the person may look “more
multiple” than they ever have for a period, with accents or young
voices coming through. What is actually happening is that the back is
presenting without masking who they are through the shell. Meanwhile,
the shell alters may decide to coalesce, for greater strength, and may
decide to change jobs. Each system will decide what is best for them.
Internal Councils:
Survivors of Illuminati programming will always have some type of hierarchy
inside. This is because the cult itself is very hierarchical, and puts
this hierarchy inside the person. What better way to inspire loyalty
to leadership than to put the leadership inside the person’s head?
Trainers are also very hierarchy conscious themselves. They know that
a system without hierarchy and head honchos inside to direct things
will be a system in chaos. They will not leave the person’s system
leaderless inside.
Many trainers will put themselves in the person, over the internal
programmers or trainers. This is because they are egotistical, but also
because it uses a well known phenomenon of human nature: PEOPLE TEND
TO INTERNALIZE THEIR ABUSERS. The survivor may be horrified to find
a representative of one of their worst perpetrators inside, but this
was a survival mechanism. A tenet of human behavior is that often people
will punish someone less who mimics them. A brutal nazi will be less
likely to punish another brutal nazi, but will look down upon and punish
a weak, crying person. So, the survivor will internalize the rough nazi
inside, to avoid being hurt. The survivor may mimic accents, mannerisms,
even claim the perpetrator’s life history as their own.
The ultimate form of internalization comes with internalizing hierarchical
councils. The person, under pain, hypnosis, and drugs, will be taught
to incorporate a highly dissociated group inside to lead the others.
These will often be created from core splits, because the trainers want
them to be extremely strong, stable alters in the system.
Triads of three elders may be seen
Platinum's may have a head council of three
Jewels will have a triad, made up of ruby, emerald, diamond in many
systems, to rule over the others
And, of course, an internal “leadership council”, “System
Above”, “Ascended Masters”, “supreme council”,
regional council, world council, etc. may be found. The councils found
will vary with each survivor.
These internal groups will correlate roughly to the outside group.
Often the child or youth at age twelve will be presented to these groups
in a formal coming of age ceremony. This ceremony is considered quite
an honor, and will involve the child being traumatized and accepting
the leadership of the council for the rest of their life. Undying loyalty
is promised. There may be other occasions the person will be forced
to come before the councils throughout their lifespan, either for judgment,
to pass tests, for punishment, or elevation. These councils will be
seen as holding power of life or death, and the child or youth will
do anything to gain their favor. The child will internalize them. The
trainer will help with the internalization, using photographs or holographic
images of the people to “burn them in”. Each member of the
group will be given different leadership tasks.
It is not uncommon for the survivor to incorporate a parent, both parents,
or grandparents, into their internal leadership hierarchy in a generational
survivor.
High priests and priestesses may sit on ruling councils inside.
Suggestions:
Internal leadership councils will often be some of the most resistant
to, and hostile towards therapy, especially in the early stages. They
will verbally banter with, or refuse to speak to, the therapist, as
being “beneath their notice.” They are mimicking the haughty,
hierarchical attitudes they have been exposed to all their lives.
They also have the most to lose, if the survivor leaves the cult, and
may fight this decision tooth and nail. They will often be the alters
with an “attitude”.
Both the survivor and therapist need to recognize that these parts
had powerful needs that were met in the cult setting. To ignore this
and argue with them will only entrench their belief that therapists
are stupid and unknowing people. Acknowledge their internal role while
gently pointing out reality. Try to enlist their aid in helping the
survivor strengthen. Discuss honestly the pros and cons of leaving the
cult. These are highly intellectual alters, and they need to express
their concerns and doubts. Setting good boundaries and not allowing
verbal abuse of the therapist is important. These alters are used to
“pushing people around” verbally, and have been rewarded
for it prior to therapy. Now, they need to learn new coping skills and
behaviors, and the process may take time. Allow them to vent their anger,
displeasure, and fears about the decision to leave the cult. Offer them
new jobs inside the person of leadership over safety committees, or
even decision making committees.
Sometimes, a system that has broken free from the cult, and has no
external hierarchy that they are accountable to will go through a short
period of chaos as word gets out: we’re free, and don’t
have to do what the cult tells us to do any more! Hundreds of internal
arguments may break out as to: what do we do for a living? where do
we live? what do we eat? what hobbies will we have? Everybody wants
to come out, see the daytime, and live this new, free life. But the
freedom may cause imbalance with all of the switching going on inside.
Enlisting the aid of the internal hierarchy, and creating a limited
democracy, with ground rules, may help during this time. Don’t
dismantle the internal hierarchy overnight, or the systems will be rudderless.
Enlist their aid in helping direct which direction the survivor goes.
Things will settle down after a period, as the systems learn to listen
to each other, vote on ideas, and begin going together in the same direction.
Human Experimentation
This is one of the most grievous things that still occurs in the Illuminati
today. The Illuminati were famed for deciding years ago to “go
scientific” and incorporate scientific experimentation into their
training principles. This is one area where they broke with other, more
traditional groups, who still followed “spiritual principles”.
The Illuminati decided to use scientific data, especially in the psychiatric
and behavioral sciences, to drive their training practices. This became
known openly during W.W.II, when the world heard about the experimentation
on Jews and other groups in the concentration camps, but human experimentation
had been quietly going on for years before underground.
It also did not stop at the end of the war. German trainers and scientists
were scattered around the world, and hidden, where they continued teaching
others the principles they had learned, and continued with ongoing experimentation.
Some of this experimentation occurred with government funding through
groups such as the CIA and NSA. The Illuminati had people infiltrated
throughout these groups, who used the principles discovered and shared
them with their own trainers.
Experimentation is going on, even to this day. It is done secretly.
Its purpose is to help improve and create more sophisticated training
techniques. To prevent “programming failures”, or “pfs”
as they are called in the cult.
Many, many survivors, if not all, will have been told that they are
only an experiment. This may or may not be true. Trainers like to tell
their subjects that they are experiments, even if they aren’t,
for several reasons:
- It creates immense fear and helplessness in the subject (the thought
is, if this is an experiment, I will have to work really hard to survive
this)
- It devalues the person immensely. They will feel that they have
no real value as a human being, that all they are is an experiment.
Someone who feels devalued doesn’t care, and will be willing
to do things they wouldn’t if they felt some value, some humanization.
- It gives the trainer added power, as they are the one who can begin
or stop the “experiment”. Almost always, when the person
is TOLD they are an experiment, it isn’t really true. When trainers
and cult members really do experiments, the subjects are never told,
because it could bias results. The fear could interfere with drug
effects, and skew the results. Most recent cult experimentation has
been in the area of: drug effects: using different drugs, both alone
and in new combinations and dosages, to induce trance states and open
the person to training. Drugs are looked for which will shorten the
time interval needed to induce trance state, which are quickly metabolized,
and leave no detectable residues the next day.
Behavioral science: watching and recording data on
different environmental parameters on human behavior. Modifying the
environment.
Praise and punishment as motivators.
isolation techniques: recording data both physiological and psychological
from different isolation methods. Removing, adding, combining different
methods of sensory isolation, and the effect of each.
Effectiveness of virtual reality in implanting programming.
Effectiveness of new disks created to put programming in. Cult graphics
and computer experts will work to create better and more effective VR
disks, which are tested on cult subjects for their effectiveness. The
cult wants more and more standardization, and less room for human error
and weakness, in its training techniques, which is why it is going more
and more to high tech equipment and videos. Attempts to break programming,
cause program failure; recording what is effective, what isn’t
and develop new sequences to prevent pf. Subjects under hypnosis are
ordered to try and break certain internal programming sequences. The
ways they go about this, and what seems effective, are shared with the
trainers, who then create new programs to prevent degradation of programming
from occurring.
Harmonic/light, sensory deprivation and over stimulation and the effects
neurologically and physically. New combinations of sensory input are
always being tested to see which achieve the most lasting results, and
can be done rapidly.
The cult is always trying to find new, better, faster methods to break
down subjects, put programming in, and prevent the programming from
failing.
This has been the emphasis in most research it has done. The results
of this research is shared worldwide, both by internet, phone calls,
and international trainer conferences, where trainers worldwide share
the results of what they are finding. New techniques are incorporated
by other groups which are eager to find out what is being discovered.
Suggestions:
If you have experimental programming, realize that the alters who were
used in it are heavily traumatized. They also will feel devalued, less
than human, and this was reinforced heavily by the trainers who worked
with them. They probably weren’t used in initial experiments,
as described above, but may have been used in second level experimentation.
I will explain what those terms mean.
Top trainers and leaders will initiate an experiment with a new drug.
They will learn to triturate dosages, and record all observable facts
on hundreds of subjects. After enough data is gotten, they will then
clear it for use by trainers in local groups. It will then still be
considered experimental, but will be second level, instead of first
level experimentation. At this point, all trainers in local groups will
be told to record and report any adverse reactions to the drug, any
usual dosages needed, etc. This data is collected in databanks (yes,
the cult is now in the computer age), inside of encrypted files, which
will then be sent to a central base in Langley, Virginia.
Alters used in experiments, or told that they were experiments, need
to realize they are valuable. They will need to realize they went through
intense programming, and be allowed to vent and discuss their experiences.
The fear related to believing they were an experiment needs to be vented
appropriately. They will be angry at the dehumanization, intentionality,
and coldness of what they went through, and quite rightly so. They may
rail against the effects in their life now of the experiments and procedures
they went through, and need to grieve over loss of body image; loss
of trust in people; the sense of betrayal and helplessness that they
felt during the procedures. They may want to journal, or draw pictures
of their experiences.
A warm, empathetic therapist, who listens, and believes, and does not
discount what they went through, is invaluable at this point. Allowing
internal cognitives and helpers ground parts who went through bizarre
sensory experiences, and creating “grounding committees”
inside will also help. Extra support may be needed while dealing with
experiences and feelings of this intensity.
Function Codes:
Trainers will place within the subject’s systems a special way
to organize the fragments that are related to the job they were trained
to do. These are called Function Codes, and there are three main types:
Command Codes: these are irreversible commands, put in at the limbic
level of conditioning. The first code always put in is the “halt
“ command, which stops the person in their tracks, and is the
first code any new trainer learns. This will stop the subject from assassinating
their trainer, if they have MK ULTRA or other assassin training in place.
Other command codes will include: system destruct codes (suicide);
shatter codes; erasure codes; and antisuicide codes.
Access Codes: these are specialized codes, often coded into short messages,
or numerical codes, that allow access into the person’s system.
A trainer will always begin a session by repeating the person’s
personal complete access code, which will allow authorized entry into
the system without setting off booby traps and internal protectors.
These codes may also depend and be set up on sight recognition and voice
recognition of the person giving the codes. In other words, the system
will respond to the codes only if a person who appears to be an authorized
person, such as the person’s trainer, gives them. This is to prevent
unauthorized access or using of the person by others outside of the
person’s local cult group.
Function codes: these are the “job codes” or work codes
within the system.
Often, several will be coded to link together to perform a task. These
are usually a letter, such as a Greek alphabet letter, combined with
a numeric sequence that corresponds to their place on the internal grid
or landscape.
Suggestions:
If the survivor has function codes, or the other codes internally,
it will help if the different system controllers can share these with
the person. The person can then get to know the fragments, hear their
history, and help them begin coalescing with other parts internally.
It may help to find the template these codes were fragmented from, and
help the template realize how they were traumatized to create these
fragments.
About deprogrammers:
Often people who call themselves deprogrammers will attempt to find
these codes and help the person. This is an individual decision of each
survivor and therapist. There may be excellent deprogrammers, but I
have always felt extreme caution, and never used one myself for two
reasons:
- I would never ever give away the locus of control away to an outside
person again. It would remind me to much of my own abuse, and I believe
the survivor should be self empowered in therapy as much as possible.
- There are no quick cures, or miracles, or short cuts in the process
of undoing the extensive amount of abuse that has occurred with Illuminati
programming. Even the best deprogrammers will admit that after they
are done, the person will usually have an idea of what was put in
them, but must finish with years of therapy dealing with how they
FEEL about the programming that was done. Illuminati programming takes
YEARS to put in, with extensive, methodical abuse, and a realistic
therapist will realize that it will take years of patience, support,
and hard work by both therapist and survivor to undo a lifetime of
conditioning and pain.
This is not to say that deprogrammers don’t help people; good,
reputable, safe ones have been reported to be of great help. But the
person can also undertake the process themselves of undoing their own
programming, and often the survivor is the best “internal deprogrammer”
of all. They know their inside people and what motivates them, better
than anyone else.
