Berlusconi - G-8 might Meet on Crisis

ROME:
Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi on Friday cited rumors that
stock
markets might be suspended in response to the financial meltdown but
cautioned that no world leader has been raising that hypothesis.
Earlier, Berlusconi told a news conference in Naples that world leaders
might consider such a suspension, but later told reporters that he was
actually referring to rumors that he had heard on radio.
"They are rumors that are in the newspapers," the premier was quoted as
saying by the Italian news agency Apcom.
"Maybe I made a mistake to say it, but I thought you also knew" it was only
a rumor, Berlusconi was quoted as telling the reporters.
The premier told the news conference that EU leaders might hold a summit on
the crisis Sunday in Paris and that leaders from the Group of Eight also
were considering a summit in the coming days.
The solutions to the crisis will have to be "global and innovative,"
Berlusconi said. "There is talk of suspending the markets" while
international financial rules are "rewritten."
Also on Friday, Italy's stock market regulator widened a
month long ban on
short selling to include all shares traded in the country.
The measure bans the common practice of selling borrowed shares in hopes of
buying them at a lower price, and it will be in effect until Oct. 31. Last
week the regulator had banned short-selling bank and insurance company
stocks.
The ban aims to help stop the free fall of the Milan Stock Exchange, which
along with other global markets has been suffering heavy losses in the wake
of the U.S. financial crisis.
The benchmark S&P/Mib index was down 4.5 percent Friday afternoon.
