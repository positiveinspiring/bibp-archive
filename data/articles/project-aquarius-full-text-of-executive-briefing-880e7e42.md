ORTK Editor's Note:
[The following transcript of an
alleged MJ-12 briefing provided to then President Jimmy
Carter has been provided by researcher Lee Graham, a
recipient of the document. Graham states that he received
the document on June 13, 1991 from researcher William Moore,
with the permission of a Defense Intelligence Agency
official code-named "Falcon," a member of
the "Aviary".
These notes were allegedly used by a lone MJ-12
briefing officer to provide an oral briefing to President
Carter at the White House on June 14, 1977.
We (ORTK)
are republishing the contents of this document based on letters
to Mr. Graham from the Department of Energy and
the Air Force Operations Test and Command informing him
that the document is "not classified" (and apparently genuine),
except for the cover page, which contains a still-classified
symbol (see the cover page preceding the transcript).
Readers should understand that the authenticity of this document
remains in question and should draw their own conclusions on
reading the text below. Explanatory notes are included in
parentheses and in bold print.]
Robert Collins' Notes 08-12-96:
[From all the checking that this
side has done the "Carter document" in question is not a
legitimately classified government document. But, from
government intelligence sources it is a "reconstruction" of a
briefing given to then President Carter on 77/06/14. The
briefing was "reconstructed" from a number of independent
sources who attended it. By these sources sitting down together
they were able to pool their notes written down after the
briefing and come up with the "reconstruction" shown
here. That's why on the originals some of the page numbers
were "penned" in:
The reader is cautioned that
some of the information may be false: Some of it may be
disinformation/misinformation and that one should read this
with an open mind towards skepticism.
One may notice grammar or spelling
errors. This I understand was a way of tracking the document:
The reader should also be able to notice this in the "MJ-12
documents" as well. Recent source information however has
stated that from their review of the "Carter document"
that it appears essentially correct.
The White House record on that date indicates that
President Carter met with his National Security Adviser
Dr Brzezinki: The name "Project Aquarius" is
also the same name associated with another "Aquarius" at
the National Security Agency or NSA. But,
reportedly this Top Secret "Aquarius" has to do with
Advanced Communications Theory/Systems and not UFOs.
But, NSA was quoted in a letter back on January 27th,
1987 that they knew of an Air Force program named "Aquarius"
that had been connected with UFOs. [end notes]

(TS/ORCON) (PROWORD: DANCE) Contains 16 volumes of documented
information collected from the beginning of the United States
Investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and
Identified Alien Crafts (IAC). The Project was originally
established in 1953, by order of President Eisenhower, under
control of NSC and MJ12. In 1966, the Project's name was changed
from Project Gleem to Project Aquarius. The Project was funded
by CIA confidential funds (non-appropriated). The Project was
originally classified SECRET but was upgraded to its present
classification in Dec. 1969 after Project Blue Book closed. The
purpose of Project Aquarius was to collect all scientific,
technological, medical, and intelligence information from UFO/IAC
sightings, and contacts with Alien life forms. This orderly file
of collected information has been used to advanced the United
States Space Program.
(TS/ORCON) The proceeding briefing is an historical account of
the United States Government's investigation of Aerial
Phenomenas, Recovered Alien Aircrafts, and Contacts with
Extraterrestrial Life Forms.

(TS/ORCON) In June 1947, a civilian pilot flying over the
Cascade mountains of Washington State observed nine flying discs
(later referred to as UFOs). The Commander, Air Force Technical
Intelligence Center of the then Army Air Forces became concerned
and ordered an inquiry. This was the beginning of the United
States involvement with the UFO investigations. In 1947, an
aircraft of extraterrestrial origin crashed in the desert of New
Mexico. The craft was recovered by the military, four Alien
(non-homo-sapiens) bodies were recovered in the wreckage. The
Aliens were found to be creatures not related to human beings (Atch
1).
(Editor's note: None of the referenced attachments were
included in the information Lee Graham received.)
In late 1949, another Alien aircraft crashed in the United
States and was recovered partially intact by the military. One
Alien of extraterrestrial origin survived the crash. The
surviving Alien was male and called itself "EBE". The Alien was
thoroughly interrogated by military intelligence personnel at a
base in New Mexico. The Alien's language was translated by means
of picture graphs. It was learned the Alien came from a planet
in the Zeta Reticuli star system, approximately 40 light
years from Earth. EBE lived until June 18, 1952, when he died
to an unexplained illness. During the time period EBE was
alive, he provided valuable information regarding space
technology, origins of the Universe, and exobiological matters.
Further data is contained in Atch 2.
Page 3 of 9 reads:
(TS/ORCON) The recovery of Alien aircrafts led the United States
on an extensive investigation program to determine whether these
Aliens posed a direct threat to our national security. In 1947,
the newly created Air Force initiated a program to investigate
incidents involving UFOs. The program was operated under three
different code names: Grudge, Sign, and finally
Blue Book.
The
original mission of the Air Force program was to collect and
analyze all reported sightings or incidents involving UFOs and
determine whether the information could be interrupted as
having any bearing on the security of the United States. Some
information was evaluated with the idea of using the gained data
to advance our own space technology and future space programs.
Ninety percent of the estimated 12,000 reports analyzed by the
Air Force were considered hoaxes, explained aerial phenomena's,
or natural astronomical objects. The other 10 percent were
considered legitimate Alien sightings and/or incidents.
However,
not all UFO sightings or incidents were reported under the Air
Force program. In 1953, Project Gleem was initiated by order of
President Eisenhower, who believed the UFOs presented a threat
to the national security of the United States. Project Gleem,
which became Project Aquarius in 1966, was a parallel reporting
system for UFO sightings and incidents. Reports collected under Project Aquarius were considered actual sightings of Alien
aircrafts or contacts with Alien life forms. Most reports were
made by reliable military and Defense Department civilian
personnel.

(TS/ORCON) In 1958, the United States recovered a third Alien
aircraft from the desert of Utah. The aircraft was in excellent
flying condition. The aircraft was apparently abandoned by the
Aliens for some unexplained reason, since no Alien life forms
were found in or around the aircraft. The aircraft was
considered a technological marvel by United States scientists.
However, the operating instrumentations of the aircraft were so
complex that our scientists could not interrupt their operation.
The aircraft was stored in a top security area and analyzed
throughout the years by our best aerospace scientists. The
United States gained a large volume of technological data from
the recovered Alien aircraft. A detailed description and further
information regarding the aircraft is explained in Atch 3.
Page 5 of 9 reads:
(TS/ORCON) Several independent scientific investigations, at the
request of the Air Force and CIA, were initiated during the era
of Project Blue Book. MJ12 decided that officially, the Air
Force should end their investigation of UFOs. This decision was
arrived at during the [unreadable] meeting (Atch 4) in 1966. The
reason was twofold. First, the United States had established
communication with the Aliens.
The United States felt relatively
sure the Aliens' exploration of Earth was non-aggressive and
non-hostile. It was also established that the Aliens' presence
did not directly threaten the security of the United States.
Secondly, the public was beginning to believe that UFOs were
real. The NSC felt this public feeling could lead to nationwide
panic. The United States was involved in several sensitive
projects during this time period. It was felt that public
awareness of these projects would have jeopardized the future
space program of the United States.
Therefore, MJ12 decided that
an independent scientific study of the UFO phenomena would be
needed to satisfy public curiosity. The study concluded that
sufficient data did not exist that would indicate UFOs
threatened the security of the United States. The final
conclusion satisfied the government and allowed the Air Force to
officially step out of the UFO investigating business.
Page 6 of 9 reads:
(TS/ORCON) When the Air Force officially closed Project Blue
Book in Dec. 1969, Project Aquarius continued operation under
control of NSC/MJ12. The NSC felt investigations of
UFO
sightings and incidents had to continue in secrecy without any
public knowledge. The reasoning behind the decision was this: If
the Air Force continued its investigation of UFOs, eventually
some uncleared and unbriefed Air Force or Defense Department
civilian officials would obtain the facts behind Project
Aquarius.
Obviously (for operational security reasons) this
could not be allowed. In order to continue the investigation of
UFO sightings and incidents in secrecy, investigators from CIA/DCD
[Editor's Note: One source indicated that DCD possibly refers to
a domestic collection function within CIA, illegal under law.]
and MJ12 were assigned to military and other governmental
agencies with orders to investigate all legitimate UFO/IAC
sightings and incidents.
These agents are presently operating at
various locations throughout the United States and Canada. All
reports are filtered either directly or indirectly to MJ12.
These agents are collecting reports of UFO/IAC sightings and
incidents occurring on or near sensitive governmental
installations.
[Rmc's note: AFOSI was also very deeply involved
in this collection activity.]
NOTE: Aliens have been extremely interested in our nuclear
weapons and nuclear research. Many reported military sightings
and incidents occur over nuclear weapons bases. The Alien's
interest in our nuclear weapons can only be attributed to the
future threat of a nuclear war on Earth. The Air Force have
initiated measures to insure the security of the nuclear weapons
from Alien theft or destruction.
MJ12 feels confident the
Aliens
are on an exploration of our solar system for peaceful purposes.
However, we must continue to observe and track the Aliens'
movements until it is determined that the Aliens' future plans
contain no threat to our national security or the civilization
of Earth.
Page 7 of 9 reads:
(TS/ORCON) Most governmental documents pertaining to UFO
sightings, incidents and governmental policies, including
Project Blue Book, have been released to the public under
FOIA
or under various other release programs. MJ12 felt the remaining
documents and information (not related to Project Aquarius)
relating to technological facts regarding Aliens' medical
matters, the fact that an Alien was captured alive and survived
for three years, can not be released to the public for fear the
information would be obtained by SHIS [Editor's note: This may
be a reference to hostile foreign intelligence services.]
There
was other information obtained from EBE that was deemed
sensitive and not releasable to the public. Notably, Project
Aquarius Volume IX, which pertains to tracing the Aliens' first
visitation of Earth back some 5,000 years. EBE reported that
2,000 years ago his ancestors planted a human creature on Earth
to assist the inhabitants of Earth in developing a civilization.
This information was only vague and the exact identity or
background information on this homo-sapien was not obtained.
Undoubtfully, if this information was released to the
public, it would cause a worldwide religious panic.
MJ3
[Editor's note: Apparently a reference to a designated member of
MJ12.] has developed a plan that will allow release of
Project
Aquarius, Volumes I thru III. The release program calls for a
gradual release of information over a period of time in order to
condition the public for future disclosures. Atch 5 of this
briefing contains certain guidelines for future public releases.
Page 8 of 9 reads:
(TS/ORCON) In the 1976 MJ3 report (Atch 6), it was estimated the Aliens' technology was many thousands of years ahead of United
States technology. Our scientists speculate that until our
technology develops to a level equal to the Aliens, we cannot
understand the large volume of scientific information the United
States has already gained from the Aliens. This advancement of
United States technology may take many hundreds of years.

SUB PROJECTS UNDER PROJECT AQUARIUS
- (TS/ORCON) PROJECT BANDO: (PROWORD:
RISK) Originally established in 1949. Its mission was to
collect and evaluate medical information from the surviving
Alien creature and the recovered Alien bodies. This Project
medically examined EBE and provided United States medical
researchers with certain answers to the evolution theory. (OPR:
CIA) (Terminated in 1974)
-
(TS/ORCON) PROJECT SIGMA: (PROWORD: MIDNIGHT) Originally
established as part of Project Gleem in 1954. Became a
separate project in 1976. Its mission was to establish
communication with Aliens. This Project met with positive
success, when in 1959, the United States established
primitive communications with the Aliens. On April 25, 1964,
a USAF intelligence officer met two Aliens at a prearranged
location in the desert of New Mexico [Editor's note: This
apparently refers to the Holloman AFB landing.]
[Rmc's note: The exact date was
April
24th, 1964 at a test site. Holloman was another incident.]
The contact lasted for approximately three hours. Based on the
Alien's language given to us by EBE, the Air Force officer managed
to exchange basic information with the two Aliens (Atch 7). This
project is continuing at an Air Force base in New Mexico. (OPR:
MJ12/NSA).
- (TS/ORCON) PROJECT SNOWBIRD: (PROWORD:
CETUS) Originally established in 1972. Its mission was to
test fly a recovered alien aircraft. This project is
continuing in Nevada. (OPR: USAF/NSA/CIA/MJ12)
-
(TS/ORCON) PROJECT POUNCE: (PROWORD: DIXIE) Originally
established in 1968. Its mission was to evaluate all UFO/IAC
information pertaining to space technology. PROJECT POUNCE
continues. (OPR: NASA/USAF)
