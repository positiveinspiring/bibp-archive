# HAMAS (Islamic Resistance Movement)

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_muslimbrotherhood09.htm

In the Name of Allah, the Merciful,
the Compassionate
You are the best community that has been raised up for mankind.
Ye enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency; and ye believe in
Allah. And if the People of the Scripture had believed, it had
been better for them. Some of them are believers; but most of
them are evil-doers.
They will not harm you save a trifling hurt, and if they fight
against you they will turn and flee. And afterward they will not
be helped.
"Ignominy shall be their portion
wheresoever they are found save [where they grasp] a rope
from Allah and a rope from man.
They have incurred anger
from their Lord, and wretchedness is laid upon them. That is
because they used to disbelieve the revelations of Allah,
and slew the Prophets wrongfully.
That is because they were
rebellious and used to transgress."
Surat Al-Imran (III), verses
109-111
Israel will rise and will remain
erect until Islam eliminates it as it had eliminated its
predecessors.
The Islamic World is burning. It is incumbent upon each one of
us to pour some water, little as it may be, with a view of
extinguishing as much of the fire as he can, without awaiting
action by the others.
INTRODUCTION
Grace to Allah, whose help we seek, whose forgiveness we
beseech, whose guidance we implore and on whom we rely. We pray
and bid peace upon the Messenger of Allah, his family, his
companions, his followers and those who spread his message and
followed his tradition; they will last as long as there exist
Heaven and Earth.
O, people! In the midst of misadventure, from the depth of
suffering, from the believing hearts and purified arms; aware of
our duty and in response to the decree of Allah, we direct our
call, we rally together and join each other. We educate in the
path of Allah and we make our firm determination prevail so as
to take its proper role in life, to overcome all difficulties
and to cross all hurdles. Hence our permanent state of
preparedness and our readiness to sacrifice our souls and
dearest [possessions] in the path of Allah.
Thus, our nucleus has formed which chartered its way in the
tempestuous ocean of creeds and hopes, desires and wishes,
dangers and difficulties, setbacks and challenges, both internal
and external.
When the thought matured, the seed grew and the plant took root
in the land of reality, detached from temporary emotion and
unwelcome haste, the Islamic Resistance Movement erupted in
order to play its role in the path of its Lord. In so doing, it
joined its hands with those of all Jihad fighters for the
purpose of liberating Palestine. The souls of its Jihad fighters
will encounter those of all Jihad fighters who have sacrificed
their lives in the land of Palestine since it was conquered by
the Companion of the Prophet, be Allahs prayer and peace upon
him, and until this very day.
This is the Charter of the
Islamic Resistance (Hamas) which will reveal its face,
unveil its identity, state its position, clarify its purpose,
discuss its hopes, call for support to its cause and
reinforcement, and for joining its ranks. For our struggle
against the Jews is extremely wide-ranging and grave, so much so
that it will need all the loyal efforts we can wield, to be
followed by further steps and reinforced by successive
battalions from the multifarious Arab and Islamic world, until
the enemies are defeated and Allahs victory prevails. Thus we
shall perceive them approaching in the horizon, and this will be
known before long:
"Allah has decreed: Lo! I very
shall conquer, I and my messenger, lo! Allah is strong,
almighty.:"
PART I - KNOWING THE MOVEMENT
The Ideological Aspects
Article One
The Islamic Resistance Movement draws its guidelines from
Islam; derives from it its thinking, interpretations and views
about existence, life and humanity; refers back to it for its
conduct; and is inspired by it in whatever step it takes.
The Link between Hamas and the Association of Muslim Brothers
Article Two
The Islamic Resistance Movement is one of the wings of the
Muslim Brothers in Palestine. The Muslim Brotherhood Movement
is a world organization, the largest Islamic Movement in the
modern era. It is characterized by a profound understanding, by
precise notions and by a complete comprehensiveness of all
concepts of Islam in all domains of life: views and beliefs,
politics and economics, education and society, jurisprudence and
rule, indoctrination and teaching, the arts and publications,
the hidden and the evident, and all the other domains of life.
Structure and Essence
Article Three
The basic structure of the Islamic Resistance Movement
consists of Muslims who are devoted to Allah and worship Him
verily [as it is written]: "I have created Man and Devil for the
purpose of their worship" [of Allah]. Those Muslims are
cognizant of their duty towards themselves, their families and
country and they have been relying on Allah for all that. They
have raised the banner of Jihad in the face of the oppressors in
order to extricate the country and the people from the
[oppressors] desecration, filth and evil.
Article Four
The Movement welcomes all Muslims who share its beliefs and
thinking, commit themselves to its course of action, keep its
secrets and aspire to join its ranks in order to carry out their
duty. Allah will reward them.
Dimensions of Time and Space of the Hamas
Article Five
As the Movement adopts Islam as its way of life, its time
dimension extends back as far as the birth of the Islamic
Message and of the Righteous Ancestor.
Its ultimate goal is
Islam, the Prophet its model, the Quran its Constitution.
Its
special dimension extends wherever on earth there are Muslims,
who adopt Islam as their way of life; thus, it penetrates to the
deepest reaches of the land and to the highest spheres of
Heavens.
Peculiarity and Independence
Article Six
The Islamic Resistance Movement is a distinct Palestinian
Movement which owes its loyalty to Allah, derives from Islam its
way of life and strives to raise the banner of Allah over every
inch of Palestine.
Only under the shadow of Islam could the
members of all regions coexist in safety and security for their
lives, properties and rights. In the absence of Islam, conflict
arises, oppression reigns, corruption is rampant and struggles
and wars prevail.
Allah had inspired the Muslim poet, Muhammad Iqbal, when he said:
When the Faith wanes, there
is no security
There is no this-worldliness for those who have no faith
Those who wish to live their life without religion
Have made annihilation the equivalent of life.
The Universality of Hamas
Article Seven
By virtue of the distribution of Muslims, who pursue the
cause of the Hamas, all over the globe, and strive for its
victory, for the reinforcement of its positions and for the
encouragement of its Jihad, the Movement is a universal one. It
is apt to be that due to the clarity of its thinking, the
nobility of its purpose and the loftiness of its objectives.
It is in this light that the Movement has to be regarded,
evaluated and acknowledged. Whoever denigrates its worth, or
avoids supporting it, or is so blind as to dismiss its role, is
challenging Fate itself.
Whoever closes his eyes from seeing the
facts, whether intentionally or not, will wake up to find
himself overtaken by events, and will find no excuses to justify
his position. Priority is reserved to the early comers.
Oppressing those who are closest to you, is more of an agony to
the soul than the impact of an Indian sword.
"And unto thee have we revealed
the Scripture with the truth, confirming whatever scripture
was before it, and a watcher over it.
So judge between them
by that which Allah hath revealed, and follow not their
desires away from the truth which has come unto thee.
For
each we have appointed a divine law and a traced-out way.
Had Allah willed, He could have made you one community. But
that He may try you by that which he has given you [He has
made you as you are]. So vie with one another in good works.
Unto Allah, you will all return. He will then inform you of
that wherein you differ."
Hamas is one of the links in the
Chain of Jihad in the confrontation with the Zionist invasion.
It links up with the setting out of the Martyr Izz a-din al-Qassam
and his brothers in the Muslim Brotherhood who fought the Holy
War in 1936; it further relates to another link of the
Palestinian Jihad and the Jihad and efforts of the Muslim
Brothers during the 1948 War, and to the Jihad operations of the
Muslim Brothers in 1968 and thereafter.
But even if the links have become distant from each other, and
even if the obstacles erected by those who revolve in the
Zionist orbit, aiming at obstructing the road before the Jihad
fighters, have rendered the pursuance of Jihad impossible;
nevertheless, the Hamas has been looking forward to implement
Allahs promise whatever time it might take.
The prophet, prayer
and peace be upon him, said:
The time will not come until
Muslims will fight the Jews (and kill them); until the Jews
hide behind rocks and trees, which will cry: O Muslim! there
is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill him! This will
not apply to the Gharqad, which is a Jewish tree (cited by
Bukhari and Muslim).
The Slogan of the Hamas
Article Eight
Allah is its goal, the Prophet its model, the Quran its
Constitution, Jihad its path and death for the case of Allah its
most sublime belief.
PART II - OBJECTIVES
Motives and Objectives
Article Nine
Hamas finds itself at a period of time when Islam has waned
away from the reality of life.
For this reason, the checks and
balances have been upset, concepts have become confused, and
values have been transformed; evil has prevailed, oppression and
obscurity have reigned; cowards have turned tigers, homelands
have been usurped, people have been uprooted and are wandering
all over the globe.
The state of truth has disappeared and was
replaced by the state of evil. Nothing has remained in its right
place, for when Islam is removed from the scene, everything
changes. These are the motives.
As to the objectives: discarding the evil, crushing it and
defeating it, so that truth may prevail, homelands revert [to
their owners], calls for prayer be heard from their mosques,
announcing the reinstitution of the Muslim state. Thus, people
and things will revert to their true place.
Article Ten
The Islamic Resistance Movement, while breaking its own
path, will do its utmost to constitute at the same time a
support to the weak, a defense to all the oppressed.
It will
spare no effort to implement the truth and abolish evil, in
speech and in fact, both here and in any other location where it
can reach out and exert influence.
PART III - STRATEGIES AND METHODS
The Strategy of Hamas: Palestine
is an Islamic Waqf
Article Eleven
The Islamic Resistance Movement believes that the land of
Palestine has been an Islamic Waqf throughout the generations
and until the Day of Resurrection, no one can renounce it or
part of it, or abandon it or part of it.
No Arab country nor the
aggregate of all Arab countries, and no Arab King or President
nor all of them in the aggregate, have that right, nor has that
right any organization or the aggregate of all organizations, be
they Palestinian or Arab, because Palestine is an Islamic Waqf
throughout all generations and to the Day of Resurrection.
Who
can presume to speak for all Islamic Generations to the Day of
Resurrection? This is the status [of the land] in Islamic Sharia, and it is similar to all lands conquered by Islam by
force, and made thereby Waqf lands upon their conquest, for all
generations of Muslims until the Day of Resurrection.
This [norm] has prevailed since the
commanders of the Muslim armies completed the conquest of Syria
and Iraq, and they asked the Caliph of Muslims, Umar Ibn al-Khattab,
for his view of the conquered land, whether it should be
partitioned between the troops or left in the possession of its
population, or otherwise.
Following discussions and
consultations between the Caliph of Islam, Umar Ibn al-Khattab,
and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, be peace and
prayer upon him, they decided that the land should remain in the
hands of its owners to benefit from it and from its wealth; but
the control of the land and the land itself ought to be endowed
as a Waqf [in perpetuity] for all generations of Muslims until
the Day of Resurrection.
The ownership of the land by its
owners is only one of usufruct, and this Waqf will endure as
long as Heaven and earth last. Any demarche in violation of this
law of Islam, with regard to Palestine, is baseless and reflects
on its perpetrators.
Hamas in Palestine: Its Views on Homeland and Nationalism
Article Twelve
Hamas regards Nationalism (Wataniyya) as part and parcel of
the religious faith. Nothing is loftier or deeper in Nationalism
than waging Jihad against the enemy and confronting him when he
sets foot on the land of the Muslims.
And this becomes an
individual duty binding on every Muslim man and woman; a woman
must go out and fight the enemy even without her husbands
authorization, and a slave without his masters permission.
This [principle] does not exist under any other regime, and it
is a truth not to be questioned. While other nationalisms
consist of material, human and territorial considerations, the
nationality of Hamas also carries, in addition to all those, the
all important divine factors which lend to it its spirit and
life; so much so that it connects with the origin of the spirit
and the source of life and raises in the skies of the Homeland
the Banner of the Lord, thus inexorably connecting earth with
Heaven.
When Moses came and threw his baton, sorcery and sorcerers
became futile.
Peaceful Solutions, [Peace] Initiatives and International
Conferences
Article Thirteen
[Peace] initiatives, the so-called peaceful solutions, and
the international conferences to resolve the Palestinian
problem, are all contrary to the beliefs of the Islamic
Resistance Movement.
For renouncing any part of Palestine means
renouncing part of the religion; the nationalism of the Islamic
Resistance Movement is part of its faith, the movement educates
its members to adhere to its principles and to raise the banner
of Allah over their homeland as they fight their Jihad:
"Allah
is the all-powerful, but most people are not aware."
From time to time a clamoring is
voiced, to hold an International Conference in search for a
solution to the problem. Some accept the idea, others reject it,
for one reason or another, demanding the implementation of this
or that condition, as a prerequisite for agreeing to convene the
Conference or for participating in it.
But the Islamic
Resistance Movement, which is aware of the [prospective] parties
to this conference, and of their past and present positions
towards the problems of the Muslims, does not believe that those
conferences are capable of responding to demands, or of
restoring rights or doing justice to the oppressed. Those
conferences are no more than a means to appoint the nonbelievers
as arbitrators in the lands of Islam.
Since when did the
Unbelievers do justice to the Believers?
"And the Jews will not be
pleased with thee, nor will the Christians, till thou follow
their creed. Say: Lo! the guidance of Allah [himself] is
the Guidance.
And if you should follow their desires after
the knowledge which has come unto thee, then you would have
from Allah no protecting friend nor helper."
Sura 2 (the Cow), verse 120
There is no solution to the
Palestinian problem except by Jihad.
The initiatives, proposals
and International Conferences are but a waste of time, an
exercise in futility. The Palestinian people are too noble to
have their future, their right and their destiny submitted to a
vain game.
As the hadith has it:
"The people of Syria are Allahs
whip on this land; He takes revenge by their intermediary
from whoever he wished among his worshipers. The Hypocrites
among them are forbidden from vanquishing the true
believers, and they will die in anxiety and sorrow."
(Told by Tabarani, who is
traceable in ascending order of traditionaries to Muhammad,
and by Ahmed whose chain of transmission is incomplete. But
it is bound to be a true hadith, for both story tellers are
reliable. Allah knows best.)
The Three Circles
Article Fourteen
The problem of the liberation of Palestine relates to three
circles: the Palestinian, the Arab and the Islamic.
Each one of
these circles has a role to play in the struggle against Zionism
and it has duties to fulfill. It would be an enormous mistake
and an abysmal act of ignorance to disregard anyone of these
circles. For Palestine is an Islamic land where the First Qibla
and the third holiest site are located.
That is also the place
whence the Prophet, be Allahs prayer and peace upon him,
ascended to heavens.
"Glorified be He who carried His
servant by night from the Inviolable Place of worship to the
Far Distant Place of Worship, the neighborhood whereof we
have blessed, that we might show him of our tokens! Lo! He,
only He, is the Hearer, the Seer."
Sura XVII (al-Isra), verse 1
In consequence of this state of
affairs, the liberation of that land is an individual duty
binding on all Muslims everywhere. This is the base on which all
Muslims have to regard the problem; this has to be understood by
all Muslims.
When the problem is dealt with on this basis, where
the full potential of the three circles is mobilized, then the
current circumstances will change and the day of liberation will
come closer.
"You are more awful as a fear in
their bosoms than Allah. That is because they are a folk who
understand not."
Sura LIX, (Al-Hashr, the Exile),
verse 13
The Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine is an Individual Obligation
Article Fifteen
When our enemies usurp some Islamic lands, Jihad becomes a
duty binding on all Muslims. In order to face the usurpation of
Palestine by the Jews, we have no escape from raising the banner
of Jihad.
This would require the propagation of Islamic
consciousness among the masses on all local, Arab and Islamic
levels.
We must spread the spirit of Jihad among the [Islamic] Umma, clash with the enemies and join the ranks of the Jihad
fighters.
The ulama as well as educators and teachers, publicity and
media men as well as the masses of the educated, and especially
the youth and the elders of the Islamic Movements, must
participate in this raising of consciousness.
There is no escape
from introducing fundamental changes in educational curricula in
order to cleanse them from all vestiges of the ideological
invasion which has been brought about by orientalists and
missionaries. That invasion had begun overtaking this area
following the defeat of the Crusader armies by Salah a-Din el
Ayyubi.
The Crusaders had understood that they had no way to
vanquish the Muslims unless they prepared the grounds for that
with an ideological invasion which would confuse the thinking of
Muslims, revile their heritage, discredit their ideals, to be
followed by a military invasion.
That was to be in preparation for
the Imperialist invasion, as in fact [General] Allenby
acknowledged it upon his entry to Jerusalem:
"Now, the Crusades
are over."
General Gouraud stood on the tomb of Salah a-Din and
declared: "We have returned, O Salah-a-Din!" Imperialism has
been instrumental in boosting the ideological invasion and
deepening its roots, and it is still pursuing this goal.
All
this had paved the way to the loss of Palestine. We must imprint
on the minds of generations of Muslims that the Palestinian
problem is a religious one, to be dealt with on this premise.
It
includes Islamic holy sites such as the Aqsa Mosque, which is
inexorably linked to the Holy Mosque as long as the Heaven and
earth will exist, to the journey of the Messenger of Allah, be
Allahs peace and blessing upon him, to it, and to his ascension
from it.
"Dwelling one day in the Path of
Allah is better than the entire world and everything that
exists in it.
The place of the whip of one among you in
Paradise is better than the entire world and everything that
exists in it. [Gods] worshipers going and coming in the
Path of Allah is better than the entire world and everything
that exists in it."
(Told by Bukhari, Muslim
Tirmidhi and Ibn Maja)
I swear by that who holds in His
Hands the Soul of Muhammad! I indeed wish to go to war for the
sake of Allah! I will assault and kill, assault and kill,
assault and kill (told by Bukhari and Muslim).
Article Sixteen
We must accord the Islamic [young] generations in our area,
an Islamic education based on the implementation of religious
precepts, on the conscientious study of the Book of Allah; on
the Study of the Prophetic Tradition, on the study of Islamic
history and heritage from its reliable sources, under the
guidance of experts and scientists, and on singling out the
paths which constitute for the Muslims sound concepts of
thinking and faith.
It is also necessary to study
conscientiously the enemy and its material and human potential;
to detect its weak and strong spots, and to recognize the powers
that support it and stand by it.
At the same time, we must be aware
of current events, follow the news and study the analyses and
commentaries on it, together with drawing plans for the present
and the future and examining every phenomenon, so that every
Muslim, fighting Jihad, could live out his era aware of his
objective, his goals, his way and the things happening round
him.
"O my dear son! Lo! though it be
but the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, and though it be
in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, Allah will
bring it forth.
Lo! Allah is subtle. Aware. O my dear son!
Establish worship and enjoin kindness and forbid inequity,
and persevere, whatever may befall thee.
Lo! that is of the
steadfast heart of things. Turn not thy cheek in scorn
toward folk, nor walk with pertness in the land.
Lo! Allah
loves not braggarts and boasters."
Sura XXXI (Luqman), verses 16-18
The Role of Muslim Women
Article Seventeen
The Muslim women have a no lesser role than that of men in
the war of liberation; they manufacture men and play a great
role in guiding and educating the [new] generation.
The enemies
have understood that role, therefore they realize that if they
can guide and educate [the Muslim women] in a way that would
distance them from Islam, they would have won that war.
Therefore, you can see them making consistent efforts [in that
direction] by way of publicity and movies, curricula of
education and culture, using as their intermediaries their
craftsmen who are part of the various Zionist Organizations
which take on all sorts of names and shapes such as:
the
Freemasons, Rotary Clubs, gangs of spies and the like.
All of them are nests of saboteurs
and sabotage.
Those Zionist organizations control vast material
resources, which enable them to fulfill their mission amidst
societies, with a view of implementing Zionist goals and sowing
the concepts that can be of use to the enemy.
Those
organizations operate [in a situation] where Islam is absent
from the arena and alienated from its people. Thus, the Muslims
must fulfill their duty in confronting the schemes of those
saboteurs.
When Islam will retake possession of [the means to]
guide the life [of the Muslims], it will wipe out those
organizations which are the enemy of humanity and Islam.
Article Eighteen
The women in the house and the family of Jihad fighters,
whether they are mothers or sisters, carry out the most
important duty of caring for the home and raising the children
upon the moral concepts and values which derive from Islam; and
of educating their sons to observe the religious injunctions in
preparation for the duty of Jihad awaiting them.
Therefore, we
must pay attention to the schools and curricula upon which
Muslim girls are educated, so as to make them righteous mothers,
who are conscious of their duties in the war of liberation.
They
must be fully capable of being aware and of grasping the ways to
manage their households.
Economy and avoiding waste in household
expenditures are prerequisites to our ability to pursue our
cause in the difficult circumstances surrounding us.
Therefore let them remember at all
times that money saved is equivalent to blood, which must be
made to run in the veins in order to ensure the continuity of
life of our young and old.
"Lo, men who surrender unto
Allah, and women who surrender and men who believe and women
who believe, and men who obey and women who obey, and men
who speak the truth and women who speak the truth and men
who persevere (in righteousness) and women who persevere and
men who are humble and women who are humble, and men who
give alms and women who give alms, and men who fast and
women who fast, and men who guard their modesty and women
who guard [their modesty], and men who remember Allah much
and women who remember Allah has prepared for them
forgiveness and a vast reward."
Sura 33 (Al-Ahzab, the Clans),
verse 35
The Role of Islamic Art in the
War of Liberation
Article Nineteen
Art has rules and criteria by which one can know whether it
is Islamic or Jahiliyya art.
The problems of Islamic liberation
underlie the need for Islamic art which could lift the spirit,
and instead of making one party triumph over the other, would
lift up all parties in harmony and balance.
Man is a strange and miraculous being, made out of a handful of
clay and a breath of soul; Islamic art is to address man on this
basis, while Jahili art addresses the body and makes the element
of clay paramount.
So, books, articles, publications, religious
exhortations, epistles, songs, poems, hymns, plays, and the
like, if they possess the characteristics of Islamic art, have
the requisites of ideological mobilization, of a continuous
nurturing in the pursuance of the journey, and of relaxing the
soul.
The road is long and the suffering is great and the
spirits are weary; it is Islamic art which renews the activity,
revives the movement and arouses lofty concepts and sound
planning. The soul cannot thrive, unless it knows how to
contrive, unless it can transit from one situation to another.
All this is a serious matter, no jesting. For the umma fighting
its Jihad knows no jesting.
Social Solidarity
Article Twenty
Islamic society is one of solidarity. The Messenger of
Allah, be Allahs prayer and peace upon him, said:
What a wonderful tribe were the Asharis! When they were
overtaxed, either in their location or during their journeys,
they would collect all their possessions, and then would divide
them equally among themselves.
This is the Islamic spirit which ought to prevail in any Muslim
society. A society which confronts a vicious, Nazi-like enemy,
who does not differentiate between man and woman, elder and
young ought to be the first to adorn itself with this Islamic
spirit.
Our enemy pursues the style of collective punishment of
usurping peoples countries and properties, of pursuing them
into their exiles and places of assembly.
It has resorted to
breaking bones, opening fire on women and children and the old,
with or without reason, and to setting up detention camps where
thousands upon thousands are interned in inhuman conditions. In
addition, it destroys houses, renders children orphans and
issues oppressive judgements against thousands of young people
who spend the best years of their youth in the darkness of
prisons.
The Nazism of the Jews does not skip
women and children, it scares everyone. They make war against
peoples livelihood, plunder their moneys and threaten their
honor. In their horrible actions they mistreat people like the
most horrendous war criminals.
Exiling people from their country
is another way of killing them. As we face this misconduct, we
have no escape from establishing social solidarity among the
people, from confronting the enemy as one solid body, so that if
one organ is hurt the rest of the body will respond with
alertness and fervor.
Article Twenty-One
Social solidarity consists of extending help to all the
needy, both materially and morally, or assisting in the
execution of certain actions.
It is incumbent upon the members
of the Hamas to look after the interests of the masses the way
they would look after their own interests. They must spare no
effort in the implementation and maintenance of those interests,
and they must avoid playing with anything that might effect the
future generations or cause damage to their society.
For the
masses are of them and for them, their strength is [ultimately]
theirs and their future is theirs.
The members of Hamas must share with
the people its joys and sorrows, and adopt the demands of the
people and anything likely to fulfill its interests and theirs.
When this spirit reigns, congeniality will deepen, cooperation
and compassion will prevail, unity will firm up, and the ranks
will be strengthened in the confrontation with the enemy.
The Powers which Support the Enemy
Article Twenty-Two
The enemies have been scheming for a long time, and they
have consolidated their schemes, in order to achieve what they
have achieved.
They took advantage of key elements in unfolding
events, and accumulated a huge and influential material wealth
which they put to the service of implementing their dream. This
wealth [permitted them to] take over control of the world media
such as news agencies, the press, publication houses,
broadcasting and the like.
[They also used this] wealth to stir
revolutions in various parts of the globe in order to fulfill
their interests and pick the fruits.
They stood behind the French and the
Communist Revolutions and behind most of the revolutions we hear
about here and there.
They also used the money to establish
clandestine organizations which are spreading around the world,
in order to destroy societies and carry out Zionist interests.
Such organizations are: the Freemasons, Rotary Clubs,
Lions Clubs, Bnai Brith and the like. All of
them are destructive spying organizations.
They also used the
money to take over control of the Imperialist states and made
them colonize many countries in order to exploit the wealth of
those countries and spread their corruption therein.
As regards local and world wars, it has come to pass and no one
objects, that they stood behind World War I, so as to wipe out
the Islamic Caliphate.
They collected material gains and took
control of many sources of wealth. They obtained the Balfour
Declaration and established the League of Nations in order to
rule the world by means of that organization.
They also stood
behind World War II, where they collected immense benefits from
trading with war materials and prepared for the establishment of
their state.
They inspired the establishment of the United
Nations and the Security Council to replace the League of
Nations, in order to rule the world by their intermediary.
There
was no war that broke out anywhere without their fingerprints on
it:
"...As often as they light a
fire for war, Allah extinguishes it. Their efforts are for
corruption in the land and Allah loves not corrupters."
Sura V (Al-Maida - the
Tablespread), verse 64
The forces of Imperialism in both
the Capitalist West and the Communist East support the enemy
with all their might, in material and human terms, taking turns
between themselves.
When Islam appears, all the forces of
Unbelief unite to confront it, because the Community of Unbelief
is one.
"Oh ye who believe! Take not for
intimates others than your own folk, who would spare no pain
to ruin you. Hatred is revealed by [the utterance of] their
mouth, but that which their breasts hide is greater.
We have
made plain for you the revelations if you will understand."
Sura III, (Al-Imran), verse 118
It is not in vain that the verse
ends with Gods saying: "If you will understand."
PART IV
Our Position Vis-a-Vis the
Islamic Movements
Article Twenty-Three
The Hamas views the other Islamic movements with respect and
appreciation. Even when it differs from them in one aspect or
another or on one concept or another, it agrees with them in
other aspects and concepts.
It reads those movements as included
in the framework of striving [for the sake of Allah], as long as
they hold sound intentions and abide by their devotion to Allah,
and as along as their conduct remains within the perimeter of
the Islamic circle. All the fighters of Jihad have their reward.
The Hamas regards those movements as its stock holders and asks
Allah for guidance and integrity of conduct for all. It shall
not fail to continue to raise the banner of unity and to exert
efforts in order to implement it, [based] upon the [Holy] Book
and the [Prophets] Tradition.
"And hold fast, all of you
together, to the cable of Allah, do not separate.
And
remember Allahs favor unto you how ye were enemies and He
made friendship between your hearts so that ye became as
brothers by His grace; and (how) ye were upon the brink of
an abyss of fire, and He did save you from it.
Thus Allah
makes clear His revelations unto you, that happily ye may be
guided."
Sura III (Al-Imran), verse 102
Article Twenty-Four
Hamas will not permit the slandering and defamation of
individuals and groups, for the Believers are not slanderers and
cursers.
However, despite the need to differentiate between that
and the positions and modes of conduct adopted by individuals
and groups whenever the Hamas detects faulty positions and modes
of conduct, it has the right to point to the mistake, to
denigrate it, to act for spelling out the truth and for adopting
it realistically in the context of a given problem.
Wisdom is
roaming around, and the Believer ought to grasp it wherever he
can find it.
"Allah loves not the utterance
of harsh speech save by one who has been wronged. Allah is
ever Hearer, Knower. If you do good openly or keep it
secret, or give evil, lo! Allah is forgiving, powerful."
Sura IV (Women), verses 147-148
The National (wataniyya)
Movements in the Palestinian Arena
Article Twenty-Five
[Hamas] reciprocated its respect to them, appreciates their
condition and the factors surrounding them and influencing them,
and supports them firmly as long as they do not owe their
loyalty to the Communist East or to the Crusader West.
We
reiterate to every one who is part of them or sympathizes with
them that the Hamas is a movement of Jihad, or morality and
consciousness in its concept of life.
It moves forward with the
others, abhors opportunism, and only wishes well to individuals
and groups. It does not aspire to material gains, or to personal
fame, nor does it solicit remuneration from the people.
It sets
out relying on its own material resources, and what is available
to it, [as it is said] "afford them the power you can avail
yourself of."
[All that] in order to carry out its duty, to gain
Allahs favor; it has no ambition other than that.
All the nationalist streams, operating in the Palestinian arena
for the sake of the liberation of Palestine, may rest assured
that they will definitely and resolutely get support and
assistance, in speech and in action, at the present and in the
future, [because Hamas aspires] to unite, not to divide; to
safeguard, not to squander; to bring together, not to fragment.
It values every kind word, every devoted effort and every
commendable endeavor. It closes the door before marginal
quarrels, it does not heed rumors and biased statements, and it
is aware of the right of self-defense.
Anything that runs counter or contradicts this orientation is
trumped up by the enemies or by those who run in their orbit in
order to create confusion, to divide our ranks or to divert to
marginal things.
"O ye who believe! If an
evil-liver bring you tidings, verify it, lest ye smite some
folk in ignorance and afterward repent of what ye did."
Sura XLIX (al Hujurat, the
Private Apartments), verse 6
Article Twenty-Six
The Hamas, while it views positively the Palestinian
National Movements which do not owe their loyalty to the East or
to the West, does not refrain from debating unfolding events
regarding the Palestinian problem, on the local and
international scenes.
These debates are realistic and expose the
extent to which [these developments] go along with, or
contradict, national interests as viewed from the Islamic
vantage point.
The Palestine Liberation Organization
Article Twenty Seven
The PLO is among the closest to the Hamas, for it
constitutes a father, a brother, a relative, a friend. Can a
Muslim turn away from his father, his brother, his relative or
his friend?
Our homeland is one, our calamity is one, our
destiny is one and our enemy is common to both of us. Under the
influence of the circumstances which surrounded the founding of
the PLO, and the ideological invasion which has swept the Arab
world since the rout of the Crusades, and which has been
reinforced by Orientalism and the Christian Mission, the PLO has
adopted the idea of a Secular State, and so we think of it.
Secular thought is diametrically opposed to religious thought.
Thought is the basis for positions, for modes of conduct and for
resolutions.
Therefore, in spite of our
appreciation for the PLO and its possible transformation in the
future, and despite the fact that we do not denigrate its role
in the Arab-Israeli conflict, we cannot substitute it for the
Islamic nature of Palestine by adopting secular thought.
For the
Islamic nature of Palestine is part of our religion, and anyone
who neglects his religion is bound to lose.
"And who forsakes the religion
of Abraham, save him who befools himself?"
Sura II (Al-Baqra - the Co),
verse 130
When the PLO adopts Islam as the
guideline for life, then we shall become its soldiers, the fuel
of its fire which will burn the enemies.
And until that happens,
and we pray to Allah that it will happen soon, the position of
the Hamas towards the PLO is one of a son towards his father, a
brother towards his brother, and a relative towards his relative
who suffers the others pain when a thorn hits him, who supports
the other in the confrontation with the enemies and who wishes
him divine guidance and integrity of conduct.
Your brother, your brother! Whoever has no brother, is like a
fighter who runs to the battle without weapons. A cousin for man
is like the best wing, and no falcon can take off without wings.
Article Twenty-Eight
The Zionist invasion is a mischievous one. It does not
hesitate to take any road, or to pursue all despicable and
repulsive means to fulfill its desires.
It relies to a great
extent, for its meddling and spying activities, on the
clandestine organizations which it has established, such as the
Freemasons, Rotary Clubs, Lions, and other
spying associations.
All those secret organizations, some which
are overt, act for the interests of Zionism and under its
directions, strive to demolish societies, to destroy values, to
wreck answerableness, to totter virtues and to wipe out Islam.
It stands behind the diffusion of drugs and toxics of all kinds
in order to facilitate its control and expansion.
The Arab states surrounding Israel are required to open their
borders to the Jihad fighters, the sons of the Arab and Islamic
peoples, to enable them to play their role and to join their
efforts to those of their brothers among the Muslim Brothers
in Palestine.
The other Arab and Islamic states are required, at the very
least, to facilitate the movement of the Jihad fighters from and
to them.
We cannot fail to remind every Muslim that when the
Jews occupied Holy Jerusalem in 1967 and stood at the doorstep
of the Blessed Aqsa Mosque, they shouted with joy:
"Muhammad is dead, he left
daughters behind."
Israel, by virtue of its being
Jewish and of having a Jewish population, defies Islam and the
Muslims.
"Let the eyes of the cowards not
fall asleep."
National and Religious
Associations, Institutions, the Intelligentsia, and the Arab and
Islamic Worlds
Article Twenty-Nine
Hamas hopes that those Associations will stand by it on all
levels, will support it, adopt its positions, boost its
activities and moves and encourage support for it, so as to
render the Islamic peoples its backers and helpers, and its
strategic depth in all human and material domains as well as in
information, in time and space.
Among other things, they hold
solidarity meetings, issue explanatory publications, supportive
articles and tendentious leaflets to make the masses aware of
the Palestinian issue, the problems it faces and of the plans to
resolve them; and to mobilize the Islamic peoples ideologically,
educationally and culturally in order to fulfill their role in
the crucial war of liberation, as they had played their role in
the defeat of the Crusades and in the rout of the Tartars
and had saved human civilization.
How all that is dear to Allah!
"Allah has decreed: Lo! I verily
shall conquer, I and my messengers. Lo! Allah is strong,
Almighty." Sura LVIII (Al-Mujadilah), verse 21
Article Thirty
Men of letters, members of the intelligentsia, media people,
preachers, teachers and educators and all different sectors in
the Arab and Islamic world, are all called upon to play their
role and to carry out their duty in view of the wickedness of
the Zionist invasion, of its penetration into many countries,
and its control over material means and the media, with all the
ramifications thereof in most countries of the world.
Jihad means not only carrying arms and denigrating the enemies.
Uttering positive words, writing good articles and useful books,
and lending support and assistance, all that too is Jihad in the
path of Allah, as long as intentions are sincere to make Allahs
banner supreme.
"Those who prepare for a raid in
the path of Allah are considered as if they participated
themselves in the raid. Those who successfully rear a raider
in their home, are considered as if they participated
themselves in the raid."
(Told by Bukhari, Muslim, Abu
Dawud and Tirmidhi)
The Members of Other Religions
The Hamas is a Humane Movement
Article Thirty-One
Hamas is a humane movement, which cares for human rights and
is committed to the tolerance inherent in Islam as regards
attitudes towards other religions.
It is only hostile to those
who are hostile towards it, or stand in its way in order to
disturb its moves or to frustrate its efforts.
Under the shadow of Islam it is possible for the members of the
three religions: Islam, Christianity and Judaism to coexist in
safety and security. Safety and security can only prevail under
the shadow of Islam, and recent and ancient history is the best
witness to that effect.
The members of other religions must
desist from struggling against Islam over sovereignty in this
region. For if they were to gain the upper hand, fighting,
torture and uprooting would follow; they would be fed up with
each other, to say nothing of members of other religions.
The past and the present are full of
evidence to that effect.
"They will not fight you in body
safe in fortified villages or from behind wells. Their
adversity among themselves is very great. Ye think of them
as a whole whereas their hearts are diverse. That is because
they are a folk who have no sense."
Sura 59 (al-Hashr, the Exile),
verse 14
Islam accords his rights to everyone
who has rights and averts aggression against the rights of
others.
The Nazi Zionist practices against our people
will not last the lifetime of their invasion, for,
"states built upon oppression
last only one hour, states based upon justice will last
until the hour of Resurrection."
"Allah forbids you not those who warred not against you on
account of religion and drove you not out from your houses,
that you should show them kindness and deal justly with
them. Lo! Allah loves the just dealers."
Sura 60 (Al-Mumtahana), verse 8
The Attempts to Isolate the
Palestinian People
Article Thirty-Two
World Zionism and Imperialist forces have been attempting,
with smart moves and considered planning, to push the Arab
countries, one after another, out of the circle of conflict with
Zionism, in order, ultimately, to isolate the Palestinian
People.
Egypt has already been cast out of the conflict, to a
very great extent through the treacherous Camp David Accords,
and she has been trying to drag other countries into similar
agreements in order to push them out of the circle of conflict.
Hamas is calling upon the Arab and Islamic peoples to act
seriously and tirelessly in order to frustrate that dreadful
scheme and to make the masses aware of the danger of coping out
of the circle of struggle with Zionism. Today it is Palestine
and tomorrow it may be another country or other countries.
For
Zionist scheming has no end, and after Palestine they will covet
expansion from the Nile to the Euphrates.
Only when they have
completed digesting the area on which they will have laid their
hand, they will look forward to more expansion, etc. Their
scheme has been laid out in the
Protocols of the Elders of Zion,
and their present [conduct] is the best proof of what is said
there.
Leaving the circle of conflict with Israel is a major act of
treason and it will bring curse on its perpetrators.
"Who so on that day turns his
back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to
join a company, he truly has incurred wrath from Allah, and
his habitation will be hell, a hapless journeys end."
Sura 8 (al-Anfal - Spoils of
War), verse 16
We have no escape from pooling
together all the forces and energies to face this despicable
Nazi-Tatar invasion.
Otherwise we shall witness the loss of
[our] countries, the uprooting of their inhabitants, the
spreading of corruption on earth and the destruction of all
religious values.
Let everyone realize that he is accountable to
Allah.
"Whoever does a speck of good
will bear [the consequences] and whoever does a speck of
evil will see [the consequences]."
Within the circle of the conflict
with world Zionism, the Hamas regards itself the spearhead and
the avant-garde.
It joins its efforts to all those who are
active on the Palestinian scene, but more steps need to be taken
by the Arab and Islamic peoples and Islamic associations
throughout the Arab and Islamic world in order to make possible
the next round with the Jews, the merchants of war.
"We have cast among them enmity
and hatred till the day of Resurrection. As often as they
light a fire for war, Allah extinguishes it. Their effort is
for corruption in the land, and Allah loves not corrupters."
Sura V (Al-Maidah - the Table
spread), verse 64
Article Thirty-Three
The Hamas sets out from these general concepts which are
consistent and in accordance with the rules of the universe, and
gushes forth in the river of Fate in its confrontation and Jihad
waging against the enemies, in defense of the Muslim human
being, of Islamic Civilization and of the Islamic Holy Places,
primarily the Blessed Aqsa Mosque.
This, for the purpose of calling
upon the Arab and Islamic peoples as well as their governments,
popular and official associations, to fear Allah in their
attitude towards and dealings with Hamas, and to be, in
accordance with Allahs will, its supporters and partisans who
extend assistance to it and provide it with reinforcement after
reinforcement, until the Decree of Allah is fulfilled, the ranks
are over-swollen, Jihad fighters join other Jihad fighters, and
all this accumulation sets out from everywhere in the Islamic
world, obeying the call of duty, and intoning "Come on, join
Jihad!"
This call will tear apart the clouds in the skies and it
will continue to ring until liberation is completed, the
invaders are vanquished and Allahs victory sets in.
"Verily Allah helps one who
helps Him. Lo! Allah is strong, Almighty."
Sura XXII (Pilgrimage), verse 40
PART V - THE TESTIMONY OF HISTORY
Confronting Aggressors Throughout
History
Article Thirty-Four
Palestine is the navel of earth, the convergence of
continents, the object of greed for the greedy, since the dawn
of history.
The Prophet, may Allahs prayer and peace be upon
him, points out to that fact in his noble hadith in which he
implored his venerable Companion, Maadh ibn Jabl, saying:
"O Maadh, Allah is going to
grant you victory over Syria after me, from Al-Arish to the
Euphrates, while its men, women, and female slaves will be
dwelling there until the Day of Resurrection. Those of you
who chose [to dwell in one of the plains of Syria or
Palestine will be in a state of Jihad to the Day of
Resurrection."
The greedy have coveted Palestine
more than once and they raided it with armies in order to
fulfill their covetousness. Multitudes of Crusades
descended on it, carrying their faith with them and waving their
Cross.
They were able to defeat the Muslims for a long time, and
the Muslims were not able to redeem it until their sought the
protection of their religious banner; then, they unified their
forces, sang the praise of their God and set out for Jihad under
the Command of Saladin al-Ayyubi, for the duration of nearly two
decades, and then the obvious conquest took place when the
Crusaders were defeated and Palestine was liberated.
"Say (O Muhammad) unto those who
disbelieve: ye shall be overcome and gathered unto Hell, an
evil resting place."
Sura III (Al-Imran), verse 12
This is the only way to liberation,
there is no doubt in the testimony of history. That is one of
the rules of the universe and one of the laws of existence. Only
iron can blunt iron, only the true faith of Islam can vanquish
their false and falsified faith. Faith can only be fought by
faith. Ultimately, victory is reserved to the truth, and truth
is victorious.
"And verily Our word went forth
of old unto Our Bordmen sent [to warn]. That they verily
would be helped. And that Our host, they verily would be the
victors."
Sura 38 (Al-saffat), verses
171-3
Article Thirty-Five
Hamas takes a serious look at the defeat of the Crusades at
the hand of Saladin the Ayyubid and the rescue of Palestine from
their domination; at the defeat of the Tatars at Ein Jalut where
their spine was broken by Qutuz and Al-Dhahir Baibars, and the
Arab world was rescued from the sweep of the Tatars which ruined
all aspects of human civilization.
Hamas has learned from these
lessons and examples, that the current Zionist invasion had been
preceded by a Crusader invasion from the West; and another one,
the Tatars, from the East.
And exactly as the Muslims had faced
those invasions and planned their removal and defeat, they are
able to face the Zionist invasion and defeat it.
This will not
be difficult for Allah if our intentions are pure and our
determination is sincere; if the Muslims draw useful lessons
from the experiences of the past, and extricate themselves for
the vestiges of the [western] ideological onslaught; and if they
follow the traditions of Islam.
EPILOGUE
The Hamas are Soldiers
Article Thirty-Six
The Hamas, while breaking its path, reiterates time and
again to all members of our people and the Arab and Islamic
peoples, that it does not seek fame for itself nor material
gains, or social status.
Nor is it directed against any one
member of our people in order to compete with him or replace
him.
There is nothing of that at all. It will never set out
against any Muslims or against the non-Muslims who make peace
with it, here or anywhere else.
It will only be of help to all
associations and organizations which act against the Zionist
enemy and those who revolve in its orbit.
Hamas posits Islam as a way of life, it is its faith and its
yardstick for judging. Whoever posits Islam as a way of life,
anywhere, and regardless of whether it is an organization, a
state, or any other group, Hamas are its soldiers, nothing else.
We implore Allah to guide us, to guide through us and to decide
between us and our folk with truth.
"Our Lord! Decide with truth
between us and our folk, for Thou are the best of those who
make decisions."
Sura VII (Al-Araf - the
Heights), verse 89
Our last call is:
Thanks to Allah,
the Lord of the Universe.
