XXVI. PRINCE OF MERCY, OR SCOTTISH
TRINITARIAN.
WHILE you were veiled in darkness, you heard repeated
by the Voice of
the Great Past its most ancient doctrines.
None has the right to object, if
the Christian Mason sees
foreshadowed in Chrishna and Sosiosch, in
Mithras and
Osiris, the Divine WORD that, as he believes, became
Man,
and died upon the cross to redeem a fallen race. Nor
can he object if
others see reproduced, in the WORD of the
beloved Disciple, that was in
the beginning with God, and
that was God, and by Whom everything was
made, only the
LOGOS of Plato, and the WORD or Uttered THOUGHT or
first
Emanation of LIGHT, or the Perfect REASON of the Great,
Silent,
Supreme, Uncreated Deity, believed in and adored by
all.
We do not undervalue the importance of any Truth. We
utter no word that
can be deemed irreverent by any one of
any faith. We do not tell the
Moslem that it is only
important for him to believe that there is but one
God, and
wholly unessential whether Mahomet was His prophet. We
do
not tell the Hebrew that the Messiah whom he expects was
born in
Bethlehem nearly two thousand years ago; and that
he is a heretic
because he will not so believe. And as
little do we tell the sincere
Christian that Jesus of
Nazareth was but a man like us, or His history but
the
unreal revival of an older legend. To do either is beyond
our
jurisdiction. Masonry, of no one age, belongs to all
time; of no one
religion, it finds its great truths in
all.
To every Mason, there is a GOD; ONE, Supreme, Infinite
in Goodness,
Wisdom, Foresight, justice, and Benevolence;
Creator, Disposer, and
Preserver of all things. How, or by
what intermediates He creates and
acts, and in what way He
unfolds and manifests Himself, Masonry leaves
to creeds and
Religions to inquire.
To every Mason, the soul of man is
immortal. Whether it
emanates from and will return to God, and
what its continued mode of
existence hereafter, each judges
for himself. Masonry was not made to
settle
that.
To every Mason, WISDOM or INTELLIGENCE, FORCE or
STRENGTH,
and HARMONY, or FITNESS and BEAUTY, are the
Trinity of the
attributes of God. With the subtleties of
Philosophy concerning them
Masonry does not meddle, nor
decide as to the reality of the supposed
Existences which
are their Personifications: nor whether the
Christian
Trinity be such a personification, or a Reality
of the gravest import and
significance.
To every
Mason, the Infinite justice and Benevolence of God give
ample
assurance that Evil will ultimately be dethroned, and
the Good, the True,
and the Beautiful reign triumphant and
eternal. It teaches, as it feels and
knows, that Evil, and
Pain, and Sorrow exist as part of a wise and
beneficent
plan, all the parts of which work together under God's eye to
a
result which shall be perfection. Whether the existence
of evil is rightly
explained in this creed or in that, by
Typhon the Great Serpent, by
Ahriman and his Armies of
Wicked Spirits, by the Giants and Titans that
war against
Heaven, by the two co-existent Principles of Good and
Evil,
by Satan's temptation and the fall of Man, by Lok and
the Serpent Fenris,
it is beyond the domain of Masonry to
decide, nor does it need to inquire.
Nor is it within its
Province to determine how the ultimate triumph of Light
and
Truth and Good, over Darkness and Error and Evil, is to be
achieved;
nor whether the Redeemer, looked and longed for
by all nations, hath
appeared in Judea, or is yet to
come.
It reverences all the great reformers. It sees in
Moses, the Lawgiver of the
Jews, in Confucius and
Zoroaster, in Jesus of Nazareth, and in the
Arabian
Iconoclast, Great Teachers of Morality, and Eminent Reformers,
if
no more: and allows every brother of the Order to assign
to each such
higher and even Divine Character as his Creed
and Truth require.
Thus Masonry disbelieves no truth, and
teaches unbelief in no creed,
except so far as such creed
may lower its lofty estimate of the Deity,
degrade Him to
the level of the passions of humanity, deny the
high
destiny of man, impugn the goodness and benevolence of
the Supreme
God, strike at those great columns of Masonry,
Faith, Hope, and Charity,
or inculcate immorality, and
disregard of the active duties of the Order.
Masonry is a
worship; but one in which all civilized men can unite; for
it
does not undertake to explain or dogmatically to settle
those great
mysteries, that are above the feeble
comprehension of our human
intellect. It trusts in God, and
HOPES; it BELIEVES, like a child, and is
humble. It draws
no sword to compel others to adopt its belief, or to
be
happy with its hopes. Arid it WAITS with patience to
understand the
mysteries of Nature and Nature's God
hereafter.
The greatest mysteries in the Universe are those
which are ever going on
around us; so trite and common to
us that we never note them nor reflect
upon them. Wise men
tell us of the laws that regulate the motions of
the
spheres, which, flashing in huge circles and spinning
on their axes, are
also ever darting with inconceivable
rapidity through the infinities of
Space; while we atoms
sit here, and dream that all was made for us. They
tell us
learnedly of centripetal and centrifugal forces, gravity
and
attraction, and all the other sounding terms invented
to hide a want of
meaning. There are other forces in the
Universe than those that are
mechanical.
Here are
two minute seeds, not much unlike in appearance, and two
of
larger size. Hand them to the learned Pundit, Chemistry,
who tells us how
combustion goes on in the lungs, and
plants are fed with phosphorus and
carbon, and the alkalies
and silex. Let her decompose them, analyze
them, torture
them in all the ways she knows. The net result of each is
a
little sugar, a little fibrin, a little water - carbon,
potassium, sodium, and
the like - one cares not to know
what.
We hide them in the ground: and the slight rains
moisten them, and the
Sun shines upon them, and little
slender shoots spring up and grow; - and
what a miracle is
the mere growth! - the force, the power, the capacity
by
which the little feeble shoot, that a small worm can nip
off with a single
snap of its mandibles, extracts from the
earth and air and water the
different elements, so
learnedly catalogued, with which it increases in
stature,
and rises imperceptibly toward the sky.
One grows to be a
slender, fragile, feeble stalk, soft of texture, like
an
ordinary weed; another a strong bush, of woody fibre,
armed with thorns,
and sturdy enough to bid defiance to the
winds : the third a tender tree,
subject to be blighted by
the frost, and looked down upon by all the forest;
while
another spreads its
rugged arms abroad, and cares for neither
frost nor ice, nor the snows that
for months lie around its
roots.
But lo! out of the brown foul earth, and colorless
invisible air, and limpid
rain-water, the chemistry of the
seeds has extracted colors - four different
shades of
green, that paint the leaves which put forth in the spring upon
our
plants, our shrubs, and our trees. Later still come the
flowers - the vivid
colors of the rose, the beautiful
brilliance of the carnation, the modest blush
of the apple,
and the splendid white of the orange. Whence come the
colors
of the leaves and flowers? By what process of
chemistry are they extracted
from the carbon, the
phosphorus, and the lime? Is it any greater miracle to
make
something out of nothing?
Pluck the flowers. Inhale the
delicious perfumes; each perfect, and all
delicious. Whence
have they come? By what combination of acids and
alkalies
could the chemist's laboratory produce them?
And now on two
comes the fruit - the ruddy apple and the golden
orange.
Pluck them - open them! The texture and fabric how
totally different! The
taste how entirely dissimilar - the
perfume of each distinct from its flower
and from the
other. Whence the taste and this new perfume? The
same
earth and air and water have been made to furnish a
different taste to each
fruit, a different perfume not only
to each fruit, but to each fruit and its
own
flower.
Is it any more a problem whence come
thought and will and perception and
all the phenomena of
the mind, than this, whence come the colors, the
perfumes,
the taste, of the fruit and flower?
And lo! in each fruit
new seeds, each gifted with the same wondrous power
of
reproduction - each with the same wondrous forces wrapped up in it
to
be again in turn evolved. Forces that had lived three
thousand years in the
grain of wheat found in the wrappings
of an Egyptian mummy; forces of
which learning and science
and wisdom know no more than they do of the
nature and laws
of action of God. What can we know of the nature, and
how
can we understand the powers and mode of operation of the
human
soul, when the glossy leaves, the pearl-white flower,
and the golden fruit of
the orange are miracles wholly
beyond our comprehension?
We but hide our ignorance in a
cloud of words; - and the words too often are
mere
combinations of sounds without any meaning.
What is the
centrifugal force? A tendency to go in a particular direction!
What
external "force," then, produces that
tendency?
What force draws the needle round to the north?
What force moves the muscle
that raises the arm, when the
will determines it shall rise? Whence comes the
will
itself? Is it spontaneous - a first cause, or an effect? These too
are miracles;
inexplicable as the creation, or the
existence and self-existence of God.
Who will explain to us
the passion, the peevishness, the anger, the memory,
and
affections of the small canary-wren? the consciousness
of identity and the
dreams of the dog? the reasoning powers
of the elephant? the wondrous
instincts, passions,
government, and civil policy, and modes of communication
of
ideas of the ant and bee?
Who has yet made us
to understand, with all his learned words, how heat
comes
to us from the Sun, and light from the remote Stars,
setting out upon its journey
earth-ward from some, at the
time the Chaldeans commenced to build the Tower
of Babel?
Or how the image of an external object comes to and fixes itself
upon
the retina of the eye; and when there, how that mere
empty, unsubstantial image
becomes transmuted into the
wondrous thing that we call SIGHT? Or how the
waves of the
atmosphere striking upon the tympanum of the ear - those
thin,
invisible waves - produce the equally wondrous
phenomenon of HEARING, and
become the roar of the tornado,
the crash of the thunder, the mighty voice of the
ocean,
the chirping of the cricket, the delicate sweet notes and exquisite
trills
and variations of the wren and mocking-bird, or the
magic melody of the
instrument of Paganini?
Our
senses are mysteries to us, and we are mysteries to ourselves.
Philosophy
has taught us nothing as to the nature of our
sensations, our perceptions, our
cognizances, the origin of
our thoughts and ideas, but words. By no effort or
degree
of reflection, never so long continued, can man become conscious of
a
personal identity in himself, separate and distinct from
his body and his brain.
We torture ourselves in the effort
to gain an idea of ourselves, and weary with
the exertion.
Who has yet made us understand how, from the contact with
a
foreign body, the image in the eye, the wave of air
impinging on the ear,
particular particles entering the
nostrils, and coming in contact with the palate,
come
sensations in the nerves, and from that, perception in the mind, of
the
animal or the man?
What do we know of Substance? Men
even doubt yet whether it exists.
Philosophers tell us that
our senses make known to us only the attributes
of
substance, extension, hardness, color, and the like; but
not the thing itself that is
extended, solid, black or
white; as we know the attributes of the Soul, its
thoughts
and its perceptions, and not the Soul itself which perceives and
thinks.
What a wondrous mystery is there in heat and light,
existing, we know not how,
within certain limits, narrow in
comparison with infinity, beyond which on every
side
stretch out infinite space and the blackness of unimaginable
darkness, and
the intensity of inconceivable cold! Think
only of the mighty Power required to
maintain warmth and
light in the central point of such an infinity, to
whose
darkness that of Midnight, to whose cold that of the
last Arctic Island is nothing.
And yet GOD is
everywhere.
And what a mystery are the effects of heat and
cold upon the wondrous fluid that
we call water! What a
mystery lies hidden in every flake of snow and in
every
crystal of ice, and in their final transformation
into the invisible vapor that rises
from the ocean or the
land, and floats above the summits of the mountains!
What a
multitude of wonders, indeed, has chemistry unveiled to our eyes!
Think
only that if some single law enacted by God were at
once repealed, that of
attraction or affinity or cohesion,
for example, the whole material world, with its
solid
granite and adamant, its veins of gold and silver, its trap and
porphyry, its
huge beds of coal, our own frames and the
very ribs and bones of this
apparently indestructible
earth, would instantaneously dissolve, with all Suns
and
Stars and Worlds throughout all the Universe of God, into a thin
invisible
vapor of infinitely minute particles or atoms,
diffused throughout infinite space;
and with them light and
heat would disappear; unless the Deity Himself be, as
the
Ancient Persians thought, the Eternal Light and the Immortal
Fire.
The mysteries of the Great Universe of God! How can
we with our limited mental
vision expect to grasp and
comprehend them! Infinite SPACE, stretching out
from us
every way, without limit: infinite TIME, without beginning or end;
and
WE, HERE, and NOW, in the centre of each! An infinity
of suns, the nearest of
which only diminish in size, viewed
with the most powerful telescope: each with
its retinue of
worlds; infinite numbers of such suns, so remote from us that
their
light would not reach us, journeying during an
infinity of time, while the light that
has
reached us,
from some that we seem to see, has been upon its journey
for
fifty centuries: our world spinning upon its axis, and
rushing ever in its
circuit round the sun; and it, the sun,
and all our system revolving round
some great central
point; and that, and suns, stars, and worlds
evermore
flashing onward with incredible rapidity through
illimitable space: and
then, in every drop of water that we
drink, in every morsel of much of our
food, in the air, in
the earth, in the sea, incredible multitudes of
living
creatures, invisible to the naked eye, of a
minuteness beyond belief, yet
organized, living, feeding,
perhaps with consciousness of identity, and
memory and
instinct.
Such are some of the mysteries of the great
Universe of God. And yet we,
whose life and that of the
world on which we live form but a point in the
centre of
infinite Time: we, who nourish animalculæ within, and on
whom
vegetables grow without, would fain learn how God
created this Universe,
would understand His Powers, His
Attributes, His Emanations, His Mode
of Existence and of
Action; would fain know the plan according to which
all
events proceed, that plan profound as God Himself; would know
the
laws by which He controls His Universe; would fain see
and talk to Him
face to face, as man talks to man: and we
try not to believe, because we
do not
understand.
He commands us to love one another, to love our
neighbor as ourself;
and we dispute and wrangle, and hate
and slay each other, because we
cannot be of one opinion as
to the Essence of His Nature, as to His
Attributes; whether
He became man born of a woman, and was crucified;
whether
the Holy Ghost is of the same substance with the Father, or
only
of a similar substance; whether a feeble old man is
God's Vicegerent;
whether some are elected from all
eternity to be saved, and others to be
condemned and
punished; whether punishment of the wicked after death
is
to be eternal; whether this doctrine or the other be heresy or
truth;-
drenching the world with blood, depopulating
realms, and turning fertile
lands into deserts; until, for
religious war, persecution, and bloodshed, the
Earth for
many a century has rolled round the Sun, a
charnel-house,
steaming and reeking with human gore, the
blood of brother slain by
brother for opinion's sake, that
has soaked into and polluted all her veins,
and made her a
horror to her sisters of the Universe.
And if men were all
Masons, and obeyed with all their heart
her mild and gentle,
teachings, that world would be a paradise;
while
intolerance and persecution make of it a hell. For
this is the Masonic
Creed: BELIEVE, in God's Infinite
Benevolence, Wisdom, and Justice:
HOPE, for the final
triumph of Good over Evil, and for Perfect Harmony as
the
final result of all the concords and discords of the Universe: and
be
CHARITABLE as God is, toward the unfaith, the errors,
the follies, and
the faults of men: for all make one great
brotherhood.
INSTRUCTION.
Sen.·. W.·. Brother
Junior Warden, are you a Prince of Mercy?
Jun.·. W.·. I
have seen the Delta and the Holy NAMES upon it, and am
an
AMETH like yourself, in the TRIPLE COVENANT, Of which we
bear the
mark.
Qu.·. What is the first Word upon
the Delta?
Ans.·. The Ineffable Name of Deity, the true
mystery of which is known to
the Ameth
alone.
Qu.·. What do the three sides of the Delta denote to
us?
Ans.·. To us, and to all Masons, the three Great
Attributes or
Developments of the Essence of the Deity;
WISDOM, or the Reflective
and Designing Power, in which,
when there was naught but God, the Plan
and Idea of the
Universe was shaped and Formed: FORCE, or the
Executing and
Creating Power, which instantaneously acting, realized
the
Type and Idea framed by Wisdom; and the Universe, and
all Stars and
Worlds, and Light and Life, and Men and
Angels and all living creatures
WERE; and HARMONY, or the
Preserving Power, Order, and Beauty,
maintaining the
Universe in its State, and constituting the law of
Harmony,
Motion, Proportion, and Progression:- WISDOM,
which thought the plan;
STRENGTH, which created: HARMONY,
which upholds and preserves:-
the Masonic Trinity, three
Powers and one Essence: the three columns
which support the
Universe, Physical, Intellectual, and Spiritual, of
which
every Masonic Lodge is a type and symbol:- while to
the Christian Mason,
they represent the Three that bear
record in Heaven, the FATHER
WORD, and the HOLY SPIRIT,
which three are ONE.
Qu.·. What do the three Greek letters
upon the Delta, I.·.H.·. .·. [Iota, Eta,
and Sigma]
represent?
Ans.·. Three of the Names of the Supreme Deity
among the Syrians.
Phœnicians and Hebrews…. IHUH [ ]
Self-Ex
istence ... AL [ ] the Nature-God, or Soul of the
Universe... SHADAI
[ ] Supreme Power. Also three of the Six
Chief Attributes of God,
among the Kabbalists:- WISDOM
[IEH], the Intellect, ( ) of the
Egyptians, the Word ( ) of
the Platonists, and the Wisdom ( ) of the
Gnostics:
MAGNIFICENCE [AL], the Symbol of which was the Lion's
Head:
and VICTORY and GLORY [Tsabaoth], which are the two
columns
JACHIN and BOAZ, that stand in the Portico of the
Temple of Masonry.
To the Christian Mason they are the
first three letters of the name of the
Son of God, Who died
upon the cross to redeem mankind.
Qu.·. What is the first
of the THREE COVENANTS, of which we bear
the
mark?
Ans.·. That which God made with Noah;
when He said, "I will not again
curse the earth any more
for man's sake, neither will I smite any more
everything
living as I have done. While the Earth remaineth,
seed-time
and harvest, and cold and heat, and Winter and
Summer, and day and
night shall not cease. I will establish
My covenant with you, and with your
seed after you, and
with every living creature. All mankind shall no more
be
cut off by the waters of a flood, nor shall there any more be a
flood to
destroy the earth. This is the token of My
covenant: I do set My bow in the
cloud, and it shall be for
a token of a covenant between Me and the earth:
an
everlasting covenant between Me and every living creature on
the
earth."
Qu.·. What is the second of the Three
Covenants?
Ans.·. That which God made with Abraham; when He
said, "I am the
Absolute Uncreated God. I will make My
covenant between Me and thee,
and thou shalt be the Father
of Many Nations, and Kings shall come from
thy loins. I
will establish My covenant between Me and thee, and
thy
descendants after thee, to the remotest generations,
for an everlasting
covenant; and I will be thy God and
their God, and will give thee the land
of Canaan for an
everlasting possession."
Qu.·. What is the third
Covenant?
Ans.·. That which God made with all men by His
prophets; when He said:
"I will gather all nations and
tongues, and they shall come and see My
Glory. I will
create new Heavens and a new earth; and the former shall
not
be remembered, nor come into mind. The Sun shall no
more shine by
day, nor the Moon by night; but the Lord
shall be an everlasting light and
splendor,
His Spirit
and His Word shall remain with men forever. The heavens
shall
vanish away like vapor, and the earth shall wax old
like a garment, and
they that dwell therein shall die; but
my salvation shall be forever, and my
righteousness shall
not end; and there shall be Light among the Gentiles,
and
salvation unto the ends of the earth. The redeemed of the Lord
shall
return, and everlasting joy be on their heads, and
sorrow and mourning
shall flee away."
Qu.·. What
is the symbol of the Triple Covenant?
Ans.·. The Triple
Triangle.
Qu.·. Of what else is it the symbol to
us?
Ans.·. Of the Trinity of Attributes of the Deity; and
of the triple essence of
Man, the Principle of Life, the
Intellectual Power, and the Soul or Immortal
Emanation from
the Deity.
Qu.·. What is the first great Truth of the
Sacred Mysteries?
Ans.·. No man hath seen God at any time.
He is One, Eternal, All-
Powerful, All-Wise, Infinitely
just, Merciful, Benevolent, and
Compassionate, Creator and
Preserver of all things, the Source of Light
and Life,
coextensive with Time and Space; Who thought, and with
the
Thought created the Universe and all living things, and
the souls of men:
THAT IS: - the PERMANENT; while
everything beside is a perpetual
genesis.
Qu.·.
'"That is the second great Truth of the Sacred
Mysteries?
Ans.·. The Soul of Man is Immortal; not the
result of organization, nor an
aggregate of modes of action
of matter, nor a succession of phenomena
and perceptions;
but an EXISTENCE, one and identical, a living spirit,
a
spark of the Great Central Light, that hath entered info
and dwells in the
body; to be separated therefrom at death,
and return to God who gave it:
that doth not disperse nor
vanish at death, like breath or a smoke, nor can
be
annihilated; but still exists and possesses activity and
intelligence,
even as it existed in God, before it was
enveloped in the body.
Qu.·. What is the third great Truth
in Masonry?
Ans.·. The impulse which directs to right
conduct, and deters from crime,
is not only older than the
ages of nations and cities, but coeval with that
Divine
Being Who sees and rules both Heaven and earth. Nor did
Tarquin
less violate that Eternal Law, though in his reign
there might have been
no written law at Rome against such
violence; for the principle that impels
us to right
conduct, and warns us against guilt, springs out of the
nature
of things. It did not begin to be law when it was
first written, nor
was it originated; but it is coeval with the
Divine Intelligence itself. The
consequence of virtue is
not to be made the end thereof ; and laudable
performances
must have deeper roots, motives, and instigations, to
give
them the stamp of virtues.
Qu.·. What is the
fourth great Truth in Masonry?
Ans.·. The moral truths are
as absolute as the metaphysical truths. Even
the Deity
cannot make it that there should be effects without a cause,
or
phenomena without substance. As little could he make it
to be sinful and
evil to respect our pledged word, to love
truth, to moderate our passions.
The principles of Morality
are axioms, like the principles of Geometry. The
moral laws
are the necessary relations that flow from the nature of
things,
and they are not created by, but have existed
eternally in God. Their
continued existence does not depend
upon the exercise of His WILL.
Truth and Justice are of His
ESSENCE. Not because we are feeble and
God omnipotent, is
it our duty to obey His law. We may be forced, but are
not
under obligation, to obey the stronger. God is the principle of
Morality,
but not by His mere will, which, abstracted from
all other of His attributes,
would be neither just nor
unjust. Good is the expression of His will, in so
far as
that will is itself the expression of eternal, absolute,
uncreated
justice, which is in God, which His will did not
create; but which it
executes and promulgates, as our will
proclaims and promulgates and
executes the idea of the good
which is in us. He has given us the law of
Truth and
justice; but He has not arbitrarily instituted that law. justice
is
inherent in His will, because it is contained in His
intelligence and
wisdom, in His very nature and most
intimate essence.
Qu.·. What is the fifth great Truth in
Masonry?
Ans.·. There is an essential distinction between
Good and Evil, what is
just and what is unjust; and to this
distinction is attached, for every
intelligent and free
creature, the absolute obligation of conforming to what
is
good and just. Man is an intelligent and free being, - free, because
he is
conscious that it is his duty, and because it is made
his duty, to obey the
dictates of truth and justice, and
therefore he must necessarily have the
power of doing so,
which involves the power of not doing so; - capable
of
comprehending the distinction between good and evil,
justice and
injustice, and the obligation which accompanies
it, and of naturally
adhering to that obligation,
independently of any con-
tract or positive law; capable also of
resisting the temptations which urge
him toward evil and
injustice, and of complying with the sacred law of
eternal
justice.
That man is not governed by a resistless Fate or
inexorable Destiny; but
is free to choose between the evil
and the good: that justice and Right,
the Good and
Beautiful, are of the essence of the Divinity, like
His
Infinitude; and therefore they are laws to man: that we
are conscious of
our freedom to act, as we are conscious of
our identity, and the
continuance and connectedness of our
existence; and have the same
evidence of one as of the
other; and if we can put one in doubt, we have
no certainty
of either, and everything is unreal: that we can deny our
free
will and free agency, only upon the ground that they
are in the nature of
things impossible; which would be to
deny the Omnipotence of God.
Qu.·. What is the sixth great
Truth of Masonry?
Ans.·. The necessity of practising the
moral truths, is obligation. The
moral truths, necessary in
the eye of reason, are obligatory on the will.
The moral
obligation, like the moral truth that is its foundation, is
absolute.
As the necessary truths are not more or less
necessary, so the obligation
is not more or less
obligatory. There are degrees of importance among
different
obligations; but none in the obligation itself. We are not
nearly
obliged, almost obliged. We are wholly so, or not at
all. If there be any
place of refuge to which we can escape
from the obligation, it ceases to
exist. If the obligation
is absolute, it is immutable and universal. For if that
of
to-day may not be that of to-morrow, if what is obligatory on me may
not
be obligatory on you, the obligation would differ from
itself, and be
variable and contingent. This fact is the
principle of all morality. That
every act contrary to right
and justice, deserves to be repressed by force,
and
punished when committed, equally in the absence of any law
or
contract: that man naturally recognizes the distinction
between the merit
and demerit of actions, as he does that
between justice and injustice,
honesty and dishonesty; and
feels, without being taught, and in the
absence of law or
contract, that it is wrong for vice to be rewarded or
go
unpunished, and for virtue to be punished or left
unrewarded: and that,
the Deity being infinitely just and
good, it must follow as a necessary and
inflexible law that
punishment shall be the result of Sin, its inevitable
and
natural effect and corollary, and not a mere arbitrary
vengeance.
Qu.·. What is the seventh great Truth in
Masonry?
Ans.·. The immutable law of God requires, that
besides respecting the
absolute rights of others, and being
merely just, we should do good, be
charitable, and obey the
dictates of the generous and noble sentiments of
the soul.
Charity is a law, because our conscience is not satisfied nor
at
ease if we have not relieved the suffering, the
distressed, and the
destitute. It is to give that which he
to whom you give has no right to take
or demand. To be
charitable is obligatory on us. We are the Almoners
of
God's bounties. But the obligation is not so precise and
inflexible as the
obligation to be just. Charity knows
neither rule nor limit. It goes beyond
all obligation. Its
beauty consists in its liberty. "He that loveth not,
knoweth
not God; FOR GOD IS LOVE. If we love one another,
God dwelleth in us,
and His love is perfected in us. God is
love; and he that dwelleth in love,
dwelleth in God, and
God in him." To be kindly affectioned one to another
with
brotherly love; to relieve the necessities of the needy, and
be
generous, liberal, and hospitable; to return to no man
evil for evil ; to
rejoice at the good fortune of others,
and sympathize with them in their
sorrows and reverses; to
live peaceably with all men, and repay injuries
with
benefits and kindness; these are the sublime dictates of the
Moral
Law, taught from the infancy of the world, by
Masonry.
Qu.·. What is the eighth great Truth in
Masonry?
Ans.·. That the law which control and regulate the
Universe of God, are
those of motion and harmony. We see
only the isolated, incidents of
things, and with our feeble
and limited capacity and, vision cannot discern
their
connection, nor the mighty chords, that make the apparent
discord
perfect harmony. Evil is merely apparent, and all
is in reality good and
perfect. For pain and sorrow,
persecution and hardships, affliction and
destitution,
sickness and death are but the means, by which alone
the
noblest, virtues could be developed. Without them, and
without sin and
error, and wrong and outrage, as there can
be no effect without an
adequate cause, there could be
neither patience under suffering and
distress; nor prudence
in difficulty; nor temperance to avoid excess; nor
courage
to meet danger; nor truth, when to speak the truth is
hazardous;
nor love, when it is met with ingratitude; nor
charity for the needy and
destitute; nor forbearance and
forgiveness of injuries; nor toleration of
erroneous
opinions; nor charitable judgment and construction of
men's
motives and
actions; nor patriotism, nor heroism,
nor honor, nor self-denial, nor
generosity. These and most
other virtues and excellencies would have no
existence, and
even their names be unknown; and the poor virtues
that
still existed, would scarce deserve the name; for life
would be one flat,
dead, low level, above which none of the
lofty elements of human nature
would emerge; and man would
lie lapped in contented indolence and
idleness, a mere
worthless negative, instead of the brave, strong
soldier
against the grim legions of Evil and rude
Difficulty.
Qu.·. What is the ninth great Truth in
Masonry?
Ans.·. The great leading doctrine of this Degree;-
that the JUSTICE, the
WISDOM, and the MERCY of God are
alike infinite, alike perfect, and yet
do not in the least
jar nor conflict one with the other; but form a
Great
Perfect Trinity of Attributes, three and yet one:
that, the principle of merit
and demerit being absolute,
and every good action deserving to be
rewarded, and every
bad one to be punished, and God being as just as
He is
good; and yet the cases constantly recurring in this world, in
which
crime and cruelty, oppression, tyranny, and injustice
are prosperous,
happy, fortunate, and self-contented, and
rule and reign, and enjoy all the
blessings of God's
beneficence, while the virtuous and good are
unfortunate,
miserable, destitute, pining away in dungeons, perishing
with
cold, and famishing with hunger, slaves of oppression,
and instruments
and victims of the miscreants that govern;
so that this world, if there were
no existence beyond it,
would be one great theatre of wrong and injustice,
proving
God wholly disregardful of His own necessary law of merit
and
demerit; - it follows that there must be another life
in which these apparent
wrongs shall be repaired: That all
the powers of man's soul tend to
infinity; and his
indomitable instinct of immortality, and the universal
hope
of another life, testified by all creeds, all poetry,
all traditions, establish its
certainty; for man is not an
orphan; but hath a Father near at hand: and
the day must
come when Light and Truth, and the just and Good shall
be
victorious, and Darkness, Error, Wrong, and Evil be
annihilated, and
known no more forever: That the Universe
is one great Harmony, in
which, according to the faith of
all nations, deep-rooted in all hearts in the
primitive
ages, Light will ultimately prevail over Darkness, and the
Good
Principle over the Evil: and the myriad souls that
have emanated from the
Divinity, purified and ennobled by
the struggle
here below, will again return to perfect bliss in
the bosom of God, to offend
against Whose laws will then be
no longer possible.
Qu.·. What, then, is the one great
lesson taught to us, as Masons, in
this
Degree?
Ans.·. That to that state and realm
of Light and Truth and Perfection, which
is absolutely
certain, all the good men on earth are tending; and if there is
a
law from whose operation none are exempt, which
inevitably conveys their
bodies to darkness and to dust,
there is another not less certain nor less
powerful, which
conducts their spirits to that state of Happiness
and
Splendor and Perfection, the bosom of their Father and
their God. The
wheels of Nature are not made to roll
backward. Everything presses on to
Eternity. From the birth
of Time an impetuous current has set in, which
bears all
the sons of men toward that interminable ocean.
Meanwhile,
Heaven is attracting to itself whatever is
cogenial to its nature, is enriching
itself by the spoils
of the Earth, and collecting within its capacious
bosom
whatever is pure, permanent, and divine, leaving
nothing for the last fire to
consume but the gross matter
that creates concupiscence; while everything
fit for that
good fortune shall be gathered and selected from the ruins of
the
world, to adorn that Eternal City.
Let every
Mason then obey the voice that calls him thither. Let us seek
the
things that are above, and be not content with a world
that must shortly
perish, and which we must speedily quit,
while we neglect to prepare for
that in which we are
invited to dwell forever. While everything within us
and
around us reminds us of the approach of death, and
concurs to teach us
that this is., not our rest, let us
hasten our preparations for another world,
and earnestly
implore that help and strength from our Father, which
alone
can put an end to that fatal war which our desires
have too long waged with
our destiny. When these move in
the same, direction, and that which God's
will renders
unavoidable shall become our choice, all things will be
ours;
life will be divested of its vanity, and death
disarmed of its terrors.
Qu.·. What are the symbols of the
purification necessary to make us
perfect
Masons?
Ans.·. Lavation with pure water,
or baptism; because to cleanse the body is
emblematical of
purifying the soul; and because it conduces to the
bodily
health, and virtue is the health of the soul, as sin
and vice are its malady
and sickness:- unction, or
anoint-
ing with oil; because thereby we are set apart and
dedicated to the
service and priesthood of the Beautiful,
the True, and the Good:- and
robes of white, emblems of
candor, purity, and truth.
Qu.·. What is to us the chief
symbol of man's ultimate redemption
and
regeneration?
Ans.·. The fraternal supper, of
bread which nourishes, and of wine which
refreshes and
exhilarates, symbolical of the time which is to come,
when
all mankind shall be one great harmonious brotherhood;
and teaching us
these great lessons: that as matter changes
ever, but no single atom is
annihilated, it is not rational
to suppose that the far nobler soul does not
continue to
exist beyond the grave: that many thousands who have
died
before us might claim to be joint owners with
ourselves of the particles
that compose our mortal bodies;
for matter ever forms new combinations;
and the bodies of
the ancient dead, the patriarchs before and since
the
flood, the kings and common people of all ages,
resolved into their
constituent elements, are carried upon
the wind over all continents, and
continually enter into
and form part of the habitations of new souls,
creating new
bonds of sympathy and brotherhood between each man
that
lives and all his race. And thus, in the bread we eat,
and in the wine we
drink to-night may enter into and form
part of us the identical particles of
matter that once
formed parts of the material bodies called
Moses,
Confucius, Plato, Socrates, or Jesus of Nazareth. In
the truest sense, we
eat and drink the bodies of the dead;
and cannot say that there is a single
atom of our blood or
body, the ownership of which some other soul might
not
dispute with us. It teaches us also the infinite beneficence of God
who
sends us seedtime and harvest each in its season, and
makes His
showers to fall and His sun to shine alike upon
the evil and the good:
bestowing upon us unsolicited His
innumerable blessings, and asking no
return. For there are
no angels stationed upon the watchtowers of
creation to
call the world to prayer and sacrifice; but He bestows
His
benefits in silence, like a kind friend who comes at
night, and, leaving his
gifts at the door, to be found by
us in the morning, goes quietly away and
asks no thanks,
nor ceases his kind offices for our ingratitude. And
thus
the bread and wine teach us that our Mortal Body is no
more WE than the
house in which we live, or the garments
that we wear; but the Soul is I,
the ONE, identical,
unchangeable, immortal emanation from the Diety, to
return to God
and be forever happy, in His good time; as our
mortal
bodies, dissolving, return to the elements from
which they came, their
particles coining and going ever in
perpetual genesis. To our Jewish
Brethren, this supper is
symbolical of the Passover: to the Christian
Mason, of that
eaten by Christ and His Disciples, when, celebrating
the
Passover, He broke bread and gave it to them, saying,
"Take! eat! this is
My body:" and giving them the cup, He
said, "Drink ye all of it! for this is
My blood of the New
Testament, which is shed for many for the remission
of
sins;" thus symbolizing the perfect harmony and union between
Himself
and the faithful; and His death upon the cross for
the salvation of man.
The history of Masonry is the history
of Philosophy. Masons do not
pretend to set themselves up
for instructors of the human race: but,
though Asia
produced and preserved the Mysteries, Masonry has,
in
Europe and America, given regularity to their doctrines,
spirit, and action,
and developed the moral advantages
which mankind may reap from them.
More consistent, and more
simple in its mode of procedure, it has put an
end to the
vast allegorical pantheon of ancient mythologies, and
itself
become a science.
None can deny that Christ
taught a lofty morality. "Love one another:
forgive those
that despitefully use you and persecute you: be pure
of
heart, meek, humble, contented: lay not up riches on
earth, but in
Heaven: submit to the powers lawfully over
you: become like these little
children, or ye cannot be
saved, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven:
forgive the
repentant; and cast no stone at the sinner, if you too
have
sinned: do unto others as ye would have others do unto
you:" such, and
not abstruse questions of theology, were
His simple and sublime
teachings.
The early
Christians followed in His footsteps. The first preachers of
the
faith had no thought of domination. Entirely animated
by His saying, that
he among them should be first, who
should serve with the greatest
devotion, they were humble,
modest, and charitable, and they knew how
to communicate
this spirit of the inner man to the churches under
their
direction. These churches were at first but
spontaneous meetings of all
Christians inhabiting the same
locality. A pure and severe morality,
mingled with
religious enthusiasm, was the characteristic of each,
and
excited the admiration even of their persecutors.
Everything was
in common among them; their property, their joys,
and their sorrows. In
the silence of night they met for
instruction and to pray together. Their
love-feasts, or
fraternal repasts, ended these reunions, in which
all
differences in social position and rank were effaced in
the presence of a
paternal Divinity. Their sole object was
to make men better, by bringing
them back to a simple
worship, of which universal morality was the basis;
and to
end those numerous and cruel sacrifices which
everywhere
inundated with blood the altars of the gods.
Thus did Christianity reform
the world, and obey the
teachings of its founder. It gave to woman her
proper rank
and influence; it regulated domestic life; and by admitting
the
slaves to the love-feasts, it by degrees raised them
above that oppression
under which half of mankind had
groaned for ages.
This, in its purity, as taught by Christ
Himself, was the true primitive
religion, as communicated
by God to the Patriarchs. It was no new
religion, but the
reproduction of the oldest of all; and its true and
perfect
morality is the morality of Masonry, as is the
morality of every creed of
antiquity.
In the early
days of Christianity, there was an initiation like those of
the
pagans. Persons were admitted on special conditions
only. To arrive at a
complete knowledge of the doctrine,
they had to pass three degrees of
instruction. The
initiates were consequently divided into three classes;
the
first, Auditors, the second, Catechumens, and the
third, the Faithful. The
Auditors were a sort of novices,
who were prepared by certain
ceremonies and certain
instruction to receive the dogmas of Christianity.
A
portion of these dogmas was made known to the Catechumens;
who,
after particular purifications, received baptism, or
the initiation of the
theogenesis (divine generation); but
in the grand mysteries of that
religion, the incarnation,
nativity, passion, and resurrection of Christ, none
were
initiated but the Faithful. These doctrines, and the celebration of
the
Holy Sacraments, particularly the Eucharist, were kept
with profound
secrecy. These Mysteries were divided into
two parts; the first styled the
Mass of the Catechumens;
the second, the Mass of the Faithful. The
celebration of
the Mysteries of Mithras was also styled a mass; and
the
ceremonies used were the same. There were found all the
sacraments of
the Catholic Church, even the breath of
confirmation. The Priest of
Mithras promised the Initiates
deliverance from sin, by means
of confession and baptism, and
a future life of happiness or misery. He
celebrated the
oblation of bread, image of the resurrection. The
baptism
of newly-born children, extreme unction, confession
of sins, - all belonged
to the Mithriac rites. The
candidate was purified by a species of baptism,
a mark was
impressed upon his forehead, he offered bread and
water,
pronouncing certain mysterious
words.
During the persecutions in the early ages of
Christianity, the Christians
took refuge in the vast
catacombs which stretched for miles in every
direction
under the city of Rome, and are supposed to have been
of
Etruscan origin. There, amid labyrinthine windings, deep
caverns, hidden
chambers, chapels, and tombs, the
persecuted fugitives found refuge,
and there they performed
the ceremonies of the Mysteries.
The Basilideans, a sect of
Christians that arose soon after the time of the
Apostles,
practised the Mysteries, with the old Egyptian legend.
They
symbolized Osiris by the Sun, Isis by the Moon, and
Typhon by Scorpio;
and wore crystals bearing these emblems,
as amulets or talismans to
protect them from danger; upon
which were also a brilliant star and the
serpent. They were
copied from the talismans of Persia and Arabia, and
given
to every candidate, at his initiation.
Irenæaus tells us
that the Simonians, one of the earliest sects of
the
Gnostics, had a Priesthood of the
Mysteries.
Tertullian tells us that the Valentinians, the
most celebrated of all the
Gnostic schools, imitated, or
rather perverted, the Mysteries of Eleusis.
Irenæaus
informs us, in several curious chapters, of the
Mysteries
practised by the Marcosians; and Origen gives,
much information as to
the Mysteries of the Ophites; and
there is no doubt that all the Gnostic
sects had Mysteries
and an initiation. They all claimed to possess a
secret
doctrine, coming to them directly from Jesus Christ, different
from
that of the Gospels and Epistles, and superior to
those communications,
which in their eyes, were merely
exoteric. This secret doctrine they did not
communicate to
every one; and among the extensive sect of the
Basilideans
hardly one in a thousand knew it, as we learn from
Irenæaus.
We know the name of only the highest class of
their Initiates. They were
], and Strangers to the World [
styled Elect or Elus [ ].
They had at lest three Degrees -
the Material, the Intellectual, and the
Spiritual
and
the lesser and greater Mysteries; and the number of those who
attained the
highest Degree was quite
small.
Baptism was one of their most important ceremonies;
and the Basilideans celebrated
the 10th of January, as the
anniversary of the day on which Christ was baptized
in
Jordan.
They had the ceremony of laying on of
hands, by way of purification; and that of the
mystic
banquet, emblem of that to which they believed the Heavenly Wisdom
would
]. one day admit them, in the fullness of things
[
Their ceremonies were much more like those of the
Christians than those of Greece;
but they mingled with them
much that was borrowed from the Orient and Egypt:
and
taught the primitive truths, mixed with a multitude of
fantastic errors and fictions.
The discipline of the secret
was the concealment (occultatio) of certain tenets
and
ceremonies. So says Clemens of Alexandria.
To
avoid persecution, the early Christians were compelled to use great
precaution,
and to hold meetings of the Faithful [of the
Household of Faith] in private places,
under concealment by
darkness, They assembled in the night, and they
guarded
against the intrusion of false brethren and profane
persons, spies who might cause
their arrest. They conversed
together figuratively, and by the use of symbols,
lest
cowans and eavesdroppers might overhear: and there
existed among them a favored
class, or Order, who were
initiated into certain Mysteries which they were bound
by
solemn promise not to disclose, or even converse about,
except with such as had
received them under the same
sanction. They were called Brethren, the Faithful,
Stewards
of the Mysteries, Superintendents, Devotees of the Secret,
and
ARCHITECTS.
In the Hierarchiœ, attributed to
St. Dionysius the Areopagite, the first Bishop of
Athens,
the tradition of the sacrament is said to have been divided into
three
Degrees, or grades, purification, initiation, and
accomplishment or perfection; and it
mentions also, as part
of the ceremony, the bringing to sight.
The Apostolic
Constitutions, attributed to Clemens, Bishop of Rome, describe
the
early church, and say: "These regulations must on no
account be communicated to all
sorts of persons, because of
the Mysteries contained in them." They speak of
the
Deacon's duty to keep the doors, that none uninitiated
should enter at the oblation.
Ostiarii, or doorkeepers,
kept guard, and gave notice of the time of prayer and
churchassemblies;
and also by private
signal, in times
of persecution, gave notice to those within, toe able them to
avoid
danger. The Mysteries were open to the Fideles or
Faithful only; and no spectators
were allowed at the
communion.
Tertullian, who died about A. D. 216, says in
his Apology: "None are admitted to
the religious Mysteries
without an oath of secrecy. We appeal to your Thracian
and
Eleusinian Mysteries; and we are especially bound to this caution,
because if
we prove faithless, we should not only provoke
Heaven, but draw upon our heads
the utmost rigor of human
displeasure. And should strangers betray us? They
know
nothing but by report and hearsay. Far hence, ye Profane! is the
prohibition
from all holy Mysteries."
Clemens,
Bishop of Alexandria, born about A.D. 191, says, in his Stromata,
that
he cannot explain the Mysteries, because he should
thereby, according to the old
proverb, put a sword into the
hands of a child. He frequently compares the
Discipline of
the Secret with the heathen Mysteries, as to their internal
and
recondite wisdom.
Whenever the early
Christians happened to be in company with strangers,
more
properly termed the Profane, they never spoke of their
sacraments, but indicated
to one another what they meant by
means of symbols and secret watchwords,
disguisedly, and as
by direct communication of mind with mind, and by
enigmas.
Origen, born A.D. 134 or 135, answering Celsus,
who had objected that the
Christians had a concealed
doctrine said: "Inasmuch as the essential and
important
doctrines and principles of Christianity are openly taught, it is
foolish to
object that there are other things that are
recondite; for this is common to Christian
discipline with
that of those philosophers in whose teaching some things
were
exoteric and some esoteric: and it is enough to say
that it was so with some of the
disciples of
Pythagoras."
The formula which the primitive church
pronounced at the moment of celebrating
its Mysteries, was
this: "Depart, ye Profane! Let the Catechumens, and those
who
have not been admitted or initiated, go
forth."
Archelaus, Bishop of Cascara in Mesopotamia, who,
in the year 278, conducted a
controversy with the
Manichaeans, said: "These Mysteries the church
now
communicates to him who has passed through the
introductory Degree. They are
not explained to the Gentiles
at all; nor are they taught openly in the hearing
of
Catechumens: but much that is spoken is in disguised
terms that the
Faithful [ ], who possess the knowledge, may be
still more informed,
and those who are not acquainted with
it, may suffer no disadvantage."
Cyril, Bishop of
Jerusalem, was born in the year 315, and died in 386.
In
his Catechesis he says: "The Lord spake in parables to
His hearers in
general; but to His disciples He explained
in private the parables and
allegories which He spoke in
public. The splendor of glory is for those
who are early
enlightened: obscurity and darkness are the portion of
the
unbelievers and ignorant. Just so the church discovers
its Mysteries to
those who have advanced beyond the class
of Catechumens: we employ
obscure terms with
others."
St. Basil, the Great Bishop of Cæsarea, born in
the year 326, and dying in
the year 376, says: "We receive
the dogmas transmitted to us by writing,
and those which
have descended to us from the Apostles, beneath the
mystery
of oral tradition: for several things have been handed to
us
without writing, lest the vulgar, too familiar with our
dogmas, should lose a
due respect for them. . . . This is
what the uninitiated are not permitted to
contemplate; and
how should it ever be proper to write and circulate
among
the people an account of them?"
St. Gregory Nazianzen,
Bishop of Constantinople, A.D. 379, says: "You
have heard
as much of the Mystery as we are allowed to speak openly
in
the ears of all; the rest will be communicated to you in
private; and that
you must retain within yourself. …. Our
Mysteries are not to be made
known to
strangers."
St. Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, who was born
in 340, and died in 393,
says in his work De Mysteriis:
"All the Mystery should be kept concealed,
guarded by
faithful silence, lest it should be inconsiderately divulged
to
the ears of the Profane . . . . . It is not given to all
to contemplate the
depths of our Mysteries …. that they may
not be seen by those who ought
not to behold them; nor
received by those who cannot preserve them."
And in another
work: "He sins against God, who divulges to the
unworthy
the Mysteries confided to him. The danger is not
merely in violating truth,
but in telling truth, if he
allow himself to give hints of them to those from
whom they
ought to be concealed Beware of casting pearls before
swine!
.... Every Mystery ought to be kept secret; and, as
it were, to be covered
over by silence, lest it should
rashly
be divulged to the ears of the Profane. Take heed that you
do not
incautiously reveal the Mysteries!"
St.
Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, who was born in 347, and died in 430,
says
in one of his discourses: "Having dismissed the
Catechumens, we have
retained you only to be our hearers;
because, besides those things which
belong to all
Christians in common, we are now to discourse to you
of
sublime Mysteries, which none are qualified to hear, but
those who, by the
Master's favor, are made partakers of
them….To have taught them openly,
would have been to betray
them." And he refers to the Ark of the Covenant,
and says
that it signified a Mystery, or secret of God, shadowed over by
the
cherubim of glory, and honored by being
veiled.
St. Chrysostom and St. Augustine speak of
initiation more than fifty times. St.
Ambrose writes to
those who are initiated; and initiation was not
merely
baptism, or admission into the church, but it
referred to initiation into the
Mysteries. To the baptized
and initiated the Mysteries of religion were
unveiled; they
were kept secret from the Catechumens; who were
permitted
to hear the Scriptures read and the ordinary
discourses delivered, in which
the Mysteries, reserved for
the Faithful, were never treated of. When the
services and
prayers were ended, the Catechumens and spectators
all
withdrew.
Chrysostom, Bishop of Constantinople, was born in 354, and died
in 417. He
says: "I wish to speak openly: but I dare not,
on account of those who are not
initiated. I shall
therefore avail myself of disguised terms, discoursing in
a
shadowy manner ..... Where the holy Mysteries are
celebrated, we drive
away all uninitiated persons, and then
close the doors." He mentions the
acclamations of the
initiated; "which," he says, "I here pass over in
silence;
for it is forbidden to disclose such things to the
Profane." Palladius, in his life
of Chrysostom, records, as
a great outrage, that, a tumult having been
excited against
him by his enemies, they forced their way into the
penetralia,
where the uninitiated beheld what was not
proper for them to see; and
Chrysostom mentions the same
circumstance in his epistle to Pope Innocent.
St. Cyril of
Alexandria, who was made Bishop in 412, and died in 444, says
in
his 7th Book against Julian: "These Mysteries are so
profound and so exalted,
that they can be comprehended by
those only who are enlightened. I shall
not, therefore,
attempt to speak of what is so admirable in them, lest
by
discovering them to
the uninitiated, I should offend
against the injunction not to give what is
holy to the
impure, nor cast pearls before such as cannot estimate
their
worth….. I should say much more, if I were not afraid
of being heard by
those who are uninitiated: because men
are apt to deride what they do
not understand. And the
ignorant, not being aware of the weakness of
their minds,
condemn what they ought most to venerate."
Theodoret,
Bishop of Cyropolis in Syria, was born in 393, and
made
Bishop in 420. In one of his three Dialogues, called
the Immutable, he
introduces Orthodoxus, speaking thus:
"Answer me, if you please, in
mystical or obscure terms:
for perhaps there are some persons present
who are not
initiated into the Mysteries." And in his preface to
Ezekiel,
tracing up the secret discipline to the
commencement of the Christian era,
he says: "These
Mysteries are so august, that we ought to keep them
with
the greatest caution."
Minucius Felix, an
eminent lawyer of Rome, who lived in 212, and wrote
a
defence of Christianity, says: "Many of them [the
Christians] know each
other by tokens and signs (notis et
insignibus), and they form a friendship
for each other,
almost before they become acquainted."
The Latin Word,
tessera, originally meant a square piece of wood or
stone,
used in making tesselated pavements; afterward a tablet on
which
anything was written, and then a cube or die. Its
most general use was to
designate a piece of metal or wood,
square in shape, on which the
watchword of an Army was
inscribed; whence tessera came to mean the
watchword
itself. There was also a tessera hospitalis, which was a
piece
of wood cut into two parts, as a pledge of
friendship. Each party kept one
of the parts; and they
swore mutual fidelity by Jupiter. To break the
tessera was
considered a dissolution of the friendship. The
early
Christians used it as a Mark, the watchword of
friendship. With them it
was generally in the shape of a
fish, and made of bone. On its face was
inscribed the word
, a fish, the initials of which represented the
Greek
words, ; Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the
Saviour.
St. Augustine (de Fide et Svmbolis) says: "This is
the faith which in a few
words is given to the Novices to
be kept by a symbol; these few words are
known to all the
Faithful; that by believing they may be submissive to
God;
by being thus submissive, they
may live rightly; by living
rightly, they may purify their hearts and with a pure
heart
may understand what they believe."
Maximus
Taurinus says: "The tessera is a symbol and sign by which to
distinguish
between the Faithful and the
Profane."
There are three Degrees in Blue Masonry; and in
addition to the two words of two
syllables each, embodying
the binary, three, of three syllables each. There
were
three Grand Masters, the two Kings, and Khir-Om the
Artificer. The candidate gains
admission by three raps, and
three raps call up the Brethren. There are three
principal
officers of the Lodge, three lights at the Altar, three gates -of
the Temple,
all in the East, West, and South. The three
lights represent the Sun, the Moon, and
Mercury; Osiris,
Isis, and Horus; the Father, the Mother, and the Child;
Wisdom,
Strength, and Beauty; Hakamah, Binah, and Daath;
Gedulah, Geburah, nd
Tepareth. The candidate makes three
circuits of the Lodge: there were three
assassins of
Khir-Om, and he was slain by three blows while seeking to escape
by
the three gates of the Temple. The ejaculation at his
grave was repeated three
times. There are three* divisions
of the Temple, and three, five, and seven Steps. A
Master
works with Chalk, Charcoal, and a vessel of Clay; there are -.hree
movable
and three immovable jewels. The Triangle appears
among the Symbols: the two
parallel lines enclosing the
circle are connected at top, as are the Columns Jachin
and
Boaz, symbolizing the equilibrium which explains the great Mysteries
of Nature.
This continual reproduction of the number three
is not accidental, nor without a
profound meaning: and we
shall find the same repeated in all the
Ancient
philosophies.
The Egyptian Gods formed
Triads, the third member in each proceeding from the
other
two. Thus we have the Triad of Thebes, Amun, Maut, and Kharso; that
of
Philae, Osiris, Isis, and Horus; that of Elephantinë and
the Cataracts, Neph, Sate,
and Anoukë.
Osiris,
Isis, and Horus were the Father, Mother, and Son; the latter being
Light, the
Soul of the World, the Son, the Protogonos or
First-Begotten.
Sometimes this Triad was regarded as
SPIRIT, or the active Principle or Generative
Power;
MATTER, or the PASSIVE Principle or Productive Capacity; and
the
Universe, which proceeds from the two
Principles.
We also find in Egypt this Triad or Trinity;
Ammon-Ra, the Creator: Osiris-Ra. the
Giver of
Fruitfulness: Horus-Ra the
Queller of Light; symbolized by the
Summer, Autumn, and Spring Sun. For the
Egyptians had but
three Seasons, the three gates of the Temple; and on account
of
the different effects of the Sun on those three Seasons,
the Deity appears in these
three forms.
The
Phoenician Trinity was Ulomos, Chusoros, and the Egg out of which
the Universe
proceeded.
The Chaldean Triad
consisted of Bel, [the Persian Zervana Akherana],
Oromasdes,
and Ahriman; the Good and Evil Principle alike
outflowing from the Father, by their
equilibrium and
alternating preponderance to produce harmony. Each was to rule,
in
turn, for equal periods, until finally the Evil
Principle should itself become good.
The Chaldean and
Persian oracles of Zoroaster give us the Triad, Fire, Light,
and
Ether.
Orpheus celebrates the Triad of Phanes,
Ouranos, and Kronos. Corry says the Orphic
Trinity
consisted of Metis, Phanes, and Ericapaeus; Will, Light or Love, and
Life.
Acusilaus makes it consist of Metis, Eros, and Æther:
Will, Love, and Ether.
Phereycides of Syros, of Fire,
Water, and Air or Spirit. In the two former we
readily
recognize Osiris and Isis, the Sun and the
Nile.
The first three of the Persian Amshaspands were
BAHMAN, the Lord of LIGHT;
Ardibehest, the Lord Of FIRE;
and Shariver, the Lord of SPLENDOR. These at once
lead us
back to the Kabala.
Plutarch says: "The better and diviner
nature consists of three; the Intelligible (i.e. that
and
which exists within the Intellect only as yet), and Matter; , and
that
which proceeds from these, which the Greeks call
Kosmos: of which Plato calls the
Intelligible, the Idea,
the Exemplar, the Father: Matter, the Mother, the Nurse, and
the
receptacle and place of generation: and the issue of
these two, the Offspring and
Genesis."
The
Pythagorean fragments say: "Therefore, before the Heaven was made,
there
existed Idea and Matter, and God the Demiourgos
[workman or active instrument], of
the former. He made the
world out of matter, perfect, only-begotten, with a soul
and
intellect, and constituted it a
divinity."
Plato gives us Thought, the Father; Primitive
Matter, the Mother; and Kosmos, the
Son, the issue of the
two Principles. Kosmos is the ensouled Universe.
With the
later Platonists, the Triad was Potence, Intellect, and Spirit,
Philo represents
Sanchoniathon's as Fire, Light,
and
Flame, the three Sons of Genos; but this is the Alexandrian,
not the
Phœnician idea.
Aurelius says the
Demiourgos or Creator is triple, and the three
Intellects
are the three Kings: He who exists; He who
possesses; He who beholds.
The first is that which exists
by its essence; the second exists in the first,
and
contains or possesses in itself the Universal of things; all
that
afterward becomes: the third beholds this Universal,
formed and
fashioned intellectually, and so having a
separate existence. The Third
exists in the Second, and the
Second in the First.
The most ancient Trinitarian doctrine
on record is that of the Brahmins.
The Eternal Supreme
Essence, called PARABRAHMA, BRAHM,
PARATMA, produced the
Universe by self-reflection, and first revealed
himself as
BRAHMA, the Creating Power, then as VISHNU, the
Preserving
Power, and lastly as SIVA, the Destroying and
Renovating
Power; the three Modes in which the Supreme
Essence reveals himself in
the material Universe; but which
soon to be regarded as three distinct
Deities. These three
Deities came they styled the TRIMURTI, or TRIAD.
The
Persians received from the Indians the doctrine of the
three
principles, and changed it to that of a principle of
Life, which was
individualized by the Sun, and a principle
of Death, which was symbolized
by cold and darkness;
parallel of the moral world; and in which the
continual and
alternating struggle between light and darkness, life
and
death, seemed but a phase of the great struggle between
the good and
evil principles, embodied in the legend of
ORMUZD and AHRIMAN.
MITHRAS, a Median reformer, was deified
after his death, and invested
with the attributes of the
Sun; the different astronomical phenomena
being
figuratively detailed as actual incidents of his
life; in the same manner as
the history of BUDDHA was
invented among the Hindüs.
The Trinity of the Hindüs became
among the Ethiopians and Abyssinians
NEPH-AMON, PHTHA, and
NEITH - the God CREATOR, whose emblem
was a ram - MATTER,
or the primitive mud, symbolized by a globe or an
egg, and
THOUGHT, or the LIGHT which contains the germ of
everything;
triple manifestation of one and the same God
(ATHOM), considered in
three aspects, as the creative
power, goodness, and wisdom. Other
Deities were speedily
invented; and among them OSTRIS, represented by
the Sun,
ISIS, his wife, by the Moon or Earth, TYPHON, his Brother,
the
Principle of Evil and Darkness, who was the son of Osiris and
Isis. And
the Trinity of OSIRIS, ISIS, and HORUS became
subsequently the Chief
Gods and objects of worship of the
Egyptians.
The ancient Etruscans (a race that emigrated
from the Rhætian Alps into
Italy, along whose route
evidences of their migration have been
discovered, and
whose language none have yet succeeded in
reading)
acknowledged only one Supreme God; but they had
images for His
different attributes, and temples to these
images. Each town had one
National Temple, dedicated to the
three great attributes of God,
STRENGTH, RICHES, and
WISDOM, or Tina, Talna, and Minerva. The
National Deity was
always a Triad under one roof; and it was the same
in
Egypt, where one Supreme God alone was acknowledged, but
was
worshipped as a Triad, with different names in each
different home. Each
city in Etruria might have as many
gods and gates and temples as it
pleased; but three sacred
gates, and one Temple to three Divine
Attributes were
obligatory, wherever the laws of Tages (or Taunt or
Thoth)
were received. The only gate that remains in Italy,
of the olden time,
undestroyed, is the Porta del Circo at
Volterra; and it has upon it the three
heads of the three
National Divinities, one upon the keystone of
its
magnificent arch, and one above each
side-pillar.
The Buddhists hold that the God SAKYA of the
Hindüs, called in Ceylon,
GAUTAMA, in India beyond the
Ganges, SOMONAKODOM, and in
China, CHY-KIA, or Fo,
constituted a Trinity [TRIRATNA], of BUDDHA,
DHARMA, and
SANGA, - Intelligence, Law, and Union or Harmony.
The
Chinese Sabæans represented the Supreme Deity as composed
of
CHANG-TI, the Supreme Sovereign; TIEN, the Heavens; and
TAO, the
Universal Supreme Reason and Principle of Faith;
and that from Chaos,
an immense silence, an immeasurable
void. without perceptible forms,
alone, infinite,
immutable, moving in a circle in illimitable space,
without
change or alteration, when vivified by the
Principle of Truth, issued all
Beings, under the influence
of TAO, Principle of Faith, who produced one,
one produced
two, two produced three, and three produced all that
is.
The Sclavono-Vendes typified the Trinity by the three
heads of the God
TRIGLAV; and the Pruczi or Prussians by
the Tri-une God, PERKOUN,
PIKOLLOS, and POTRIMPOS, the
Deities of Light
and Thunder, of Hell and the Earth, its fruits
and animals: and the
Scandinavians by ODIN, FREA, and
THOR.
In the KABALAH, or the Hebrew traditional philosophy,
the Infinite Deity,
beyond the reach of the Human
Intellect, and without Name, Form, or
Limitation, was
represented as developing Himself, in order to create,
and
by self-limitation, in ten emanations or out-flowings,
called SEPHIROTH,
or rays, The first of these, in the world
AZILUTH, that is, within the Deity,
was KETHER, or the
Crown, by which we understand the Divine Will or
Potency.
Next came, as a pair, HAI",MAH and BAINAH,
ordinarily
translated "Wisdom" and "Intelligence," the
former termed the FATHER,
and the latter the MOTHER.
HAKEMAH is the active Power or Energy of
Deity, by which He
produces within Himself Intellection or Thinking:
and
BAINAH, the passive Capacity, from which, acted on by
the Power, the
Intellection flows. This Intellection is
called DAATH: and it is the "WORD,"
of Plato and the
Gnostics; the unuttered word, within the Deity. Here is
the
origin of the Trinity of the Father, the Mother or Holy Spirit, and
the
Son or Word.
Another Trinity was composed of
the fourth Sephirah, GEDULAH or
KHASW, Benignity or Mercy,
also termed FATHER (Aba); the fifth,
GEBURAH, Severity or
Strict Justice, also termed the MOTHER (Imma);
and the
sixth, the SON or Issue of these, TIPHARETH, Beauty
or
Harmony. "Everything," says the SOHAR, “proceeds
according to the
Mystery of the Balance" - that is, by the
equilibrium of Opposites: and
thus from the Infinite Mercy
and the Infinite justice, in equilibrium, flows
the perfect
Harmony of the Universe. Infinite POWER, which is
Lawless,
and Infinite WISDOM, in Equilibrium, also produce
BEAUTY or
HARMONY, as Son, Issue, or Result - the Word, or
utterance of the
Thought of God. Power and Justice or
Severity are the same: Wisdom
and Mercy or Benignity are
the same; - in the Infinite Divine Nature.
According to
Philo of Alexandria, the Supreme Being, Primitive Light
or
Archetype of Light, uniting with WISDOM [ ], the mother
of Creation,
forms in Himself the types of all things, and
acts upon the Universe through
the WORD [ . . Logos], who
dwells in God, and in whom all His powers
and attributes
develop themselves; a doctrine borrowed by him from
Plato.
Simon Magus and his disciples taught that the
Supreme Being or Centre of
Light produced first of all,
three couples of united
Existences, of both sexes, [ ...
Suzugias], which were the origins of all
things: REASON and
INVENTIVENESS; SPEECH and THOUGHT;
and and , CALCULATION
and REFLECTION: [
and
,
… Nöus and
Epinoia, Phöne and Ennoia, Logismos and
Enthumësis]; of
which Ennoia or WISDOM was the first produced, and
Mother
of all that exists.
Other Disciples of
Simon, and with them most of the Gnostics, adopting and
…
Pleröma, or PLENITUDE of modifying the doctrine, taught that
the
Superior Intelligences, having the Supreme Being at
their head, was
composed of eight Eons [ . . Aiönes] of
different sexes; . . PROFUNDITY
and SILENCE; SPIRIT and
TRUTH; the WORD and LIFE; MAN and the
; and ; and and : and
CHURCH: [
…. Buthos and Sigë; Pneuma and Aletheia; Logos
and
and Zöe; Anthröpos and Ekklësia].
Bardesanes,
whose doctrines the Syrian Christians long embraced,
taught
that the unknown Father, happy in the Plenitude of
His Life and Perfections,
first produced a Companion for
Himself [ ... Suzugos], whom He placed
in the Celestial
Paradise and who became, by Him, the Mother of
CHRISTOS,
Son of the Living God: i.e. (laying aside the
allegory), that the Eternal
conceived, in the silence of
His decrees, the Thought of revealing Himself by
a Being
who should be His image or His Son: that to the Son succeeded
his
Sister and Spouse, the Holy Spirit, and they produced
four Spirits of the
elements, male and female, Maio and
Jabseho, Nouro and Rucho; then Seven
Mystic Couples of
Spirits, and Heaven and Earth, and all that is; then
seven
spirits governing the planets, twelve governing the
Constellations of the
Zodiac, and thirty-six Starry
Intelligences whom he called Deacons: while the
Holy Spirit
[Sophia Achamoth], being both the Holy Intelligence and the
Soul
of the physical world, went from the Pleröma into that
material world and there
mourned her degradation, until
CHRISTOS, her former spouse, coming to her
with his Divine
Light and Love, guided her in the way to purification, and
she
again united herself with him as his primitive
Companion.
Basilides, the Christian Gnostic, taught that
there were seven emanations
from the Supreme Being: The
First-born, Thought, the Word, Reflection,
, , , , ,
Wisdom, Power, and Righteousness [ ,
and Protogonos, Nous, Logos,
Phronesis, Sophia, Dunamis, and
Dikarosunë]; from whom
emanated other Intelligences in succession, to the
number,
in all, of three hundred and sixty-five; which were God manifested,
and
composed the Plenitude of the Divine Emanations, or the
God Abraxas; of which
the Thought [or Intellect, . . Nous]
united itself, by baptism in the river
Jordan, with the man
Jesus, servant [ . Diakonos] of the human race; but
did not
suffer with Him; and the disciples of Basilides taught that the ,
put on
the appearance only of humanity, and that Simon of
Cyrene was crucified in His
stead and ascended into
Heaven.
Basilides held that out of the unrevealed God, who
is at the head, of the world of
emanations, and exalted
above all conception or designation
[ ], were evolved seven
living, self-subsistent, ever-active
hyposatized
powers:
1st. NOUS .................
2d. LOGOS
...............
3d. Phronesis ............
4th.
Sophia................
SECOND: THE ACTIVE OR OPERATIVE
POWER.
5th. Dunamis.............
6th. Dikaiosunë
.........
7th. Eirënë.................
These Seven
Powers ( .. Dunameis), with the Primal Ground out of
which
they were evolved, constituted in his scheme the
[Prote
Ogdoas], or First Octave, the root of all Existence.
From this point, the spiritual
life proceeded to evolve out
of itself continually many gradations of existence,
each
lower one being still the impression, the antetype, of the immediate
higher
one. He supposed there were 365 of these regions or
gradations, expressed by
the mystical
word
FIRST: THE INTELLECTUAL
POWERS.
...................... The
Mind.
................ The Reason.
........... The
Thinking Power.
.................
Wisdom.
............ Might, accomplishing the purposes
of
Wisdom.
THIRD: THE MORAL
ATTRIBUTES.
...... Holiness or Moral
Perfection.
................ Inward
Tranquility.
[Abraxas].
The is thus interpreted, by the
usual method of reckoning Greek letters
numerically….. a,1
.. b,1 ….j,100 …. a,1 …. x,60.. a,1 . . x,200 = 365: which
is
the whole Emanation-World, as the development of the
Supreme Being.
In the system of Basilides, Light, Life,
Soul, and Good were opposed to
Darkness, Death, Matter, and
Evil, throughout the whole course of the
Universe.
According to the Gnostic view, God was
represented as the immanent,
incomprehensible and original
source of all perfection; the unfathomable ABYSS
( . .
buthos), according to Valentinus, exalted above all possibility
of
designation; of whom, properly speaking, nothing can be
predicated; the
of Basilides, the of Philo. From this
incomprehensible Essence of
God, an immediate transition to
finite things is inconceivable. Self-limitation is
the
first beginning of a communication of life on the part of God - the
first
passing of the hidden Deity into manifestation; and
from this proceeds all further
self-developing
manifestation of the Divine Essence. From this primal link in
the
chain of life there are evolved, in the first place,
the manifold powers or
attributes inherent in the divine
Essence, which, until that first selfcomprehension,
were
all hidden in the Abyss of His Essence. Each of
these
attributes presents the whole divine Essence under
one particular aspect; and to
each, therefore, in this
respect, the title of God may appropriately be
applied.
These Divine Powers evolving themselves to
self-subsistence, become
thereupon the germs and principles
of all further developments of life. The life
contained in
them unfolds and individualizes itself more and more, but in such
a
way that the successive grades of this evolution of life
continually sink lower and
lower; the spirits become
feebler, the further they are removed from the first
link
in the series.
The first manifestation they
termed
heautou] or
was hypostatically represented
in a or
[protë katalëpsis
[proton katalëpton tou
Theou]; which
[Nous or Logos].
In the Alexandrian
Gnosis, the Platonic notion of the [Hulë]
predominates.
This is the dead, the unsubstantial - the
boundary that limits from without the
evolution of life in
its gradually advancing progression, whereby the Perfect
is
ever evolving itself into the less Perfect. This again,
is represented under
various images; - at one time as the
darkness that exists alongside of the light;
at another, as
the void [ ,
.... Kenoma, Kenon], in opposition to the
Fullness, [ .... Plëroma] of
the Divine Life; or as the
shadow that accompanies the light; or as the
chaos, or the
sluggish, stagnant, dark water. This matter, dead in
itself,
possesses by its own nature no inherent tendency;
as life of every sort is
foreign to it, itself makes no
encroachment on the Divine. As, however,
the evolutions of
the Divine Life (the essences developing themselves out
of
the progressive emanation) become feebler, the further they
are
removed from the first link in the series; and as their
connection with the
first becomes looser at each successive
step, there arises at the last step
of the evolution, an
imperfect, defective product, which, unable to retain
its
connection with the chain of Divine Life, sinks from the World of
Eons
into the material chaos: or, according to the same
notion, somewhat
differently expressed [according to the
Ophites and to Bardesanes], a
drop from the fullness of the
Divine life bubbles over into the bordering
void. Hereupon
the dead matter, by commixture with the living
principle,
which it wanted, first of all receives
animation. But, at the same time, also,
the divine, the
living, becomes corrupted by mingling with the
chaotic
mass. Existence now multiplies itself. There arises
a subordinate,
defective life; there is ground for a new
world; a creation starts into being,
beyond the confines of
the world of emanation. But, on the other hand,
since the
chaotic principle of matter has acquired vitality, there now
arises
a more distinct and more active opposition to the
God-like - a barely
negative, blind, ungodly nature-power,
which obstinately resists all
influence of the Divine;
hence, as products of the spirit of the (of the
.. Pneuma
Hulikon), are Satan, malignant spirits, wicked men,
in none
of whom is there any reasonable or moral principle, or
any
principle of a rational will; but blind passions alone
have the ascendency.
In them there is the same conflict, as
the scheme of Platonism supposes,
between the soul under
the guidance of Divine reason [the . . Nous],
and the soul
blindly resisting reason - between the [pronoia] and
the
[anagë], the Divine Principle and the natural.
The Syrian
Gnosis assumed the existence of an active, turbulent
kingdom
of evil, or of darkness, which, by its
encroachments on the kingdom of
light, brought about a
commixture of the light with the darkness, of the
God-like
with the ungodlike.
Even among the Platonists, some thought
that along with an
organized, inert matter, the substratum of the
corporeal world, there
existed from the beginning a blind,
lawless motive power, an ungodlike
soul, as its original
motive and active principle. As the inorganic matter
was
organized into a corporeal world, by the plastic power of the
Deity,
so, by the same power, law and reason were
communicated to that
turbulent, irrational soul. Thus the
chaos of the was transformed into
an organized world, and
that blind soul into a rational principle, a
mundane soul,
animating the Universe. As from the latter proceeds
all
rational, spiritual life in humanity, so from the
former proceeds all that is
irrational, all that is under
the blind sway of passion and appetite; and all
malignant
spirits are its progeny.
In one respect all the Gnostics agreed: they all held, that there
was a
world purely emanating out of the vital development
of God, a creation
evolved directly out of the Divine
Essence, far exalted above any outward
creation produced by
God's plastic power, and conditioned by
pre-existing
matter. They agreed in holding that the framer
of this lower world was not
the Father of that higher world
of emanation; but the Demiurge [ -
], a being of a kindred
nature with the Universe framed and governed
by him, and
far inferior to that higher system and the Father of
it.
But some, setting out from ideas which had long
prevailed among certain
Jews of Alexandria, supposed that
the Supreme God created and
governed the world by His
ministering spirits, by the angels. At the head
of these
angels stood one who had the direction and control of
all;
therefore called the Artificer and Governor of the
World. This Demiurge
they compared with the plastic,
animating, mundane spirit of Plato and
….Deuteros Theos;
the Platonists [the …. Theos
Genetos], who, moreover,
according to the Timæus of Plato, strives to
represent the
IDEA of the Divine Reason, in that which is becoming
(as
contradistinguished from that which is) and temporal.
This angel is a
representative of the Supreme God, on the
lower stage of existence: he
does not act independently,
but merely according to the ideas inspired in
him by the
Supreme God; just as the plastic, mundane soul of
the
Platonists creates all things after the pattern of the
ideas communicated
.... Nous - the by the Supreme .Reason [
... ho esti zöon - the
paradeigma, of the Divine Reason
hypostatized].
But these ideas transcend his limited essence; he
cannot understand
them; he is merely their unconscious
organ; and therefore is unable
himself to comprehend the
whole scope and meaning of the work which
lie performs. As
an organ under the guidance of a higher inspiration,
he
reveals higher truths than he himself can comprehend.
The mass of the
Jews, they held, recognized not the angel,
by whom, in all the
Theophanies of the Old Testament, God
revealed Himself ; they knew not
the Demiurge in his true
relation to the hidden Supreme God, who never
reveals
Himself in the sensible world. They confounded the type and
the
archetype, the symbol and the idea. They rose no higher
than the
Demiurge; they took him to be the Supreme God
Himself. But the spiritual
men among them, on the contrary,
clearly perceived, or at least divined,
the ideas veiled
under Judaism; they rose beyond the Demiurge, to
a
knowledge of the Supreme God; and are therefore properly
His
. . Therapeutai]. worshippers [
Other
Gnostics, who had not been followers of the Mosaic religion,
but
who had, at an earlier period, framed to themselves an
oriental Gnosis,
regarded the Demiurge as a being
absolutely hostile to the Supreme God.
He and his angels,
notwithstanding their finite nature, wish to
establish
their independence: they will tolerate no foreign
rule within their realm.
Whatever of a higher nature
descends into their kingdom, they seek to
hold imprisoned
there, lest it should raise itself above their
narrow
precincts. Probably, in this system, the kingdom of
the Demiurgic Angels
corresponded, for the most part, with
that of the deceitful Star-Spirits, who
seek to rob man of
his freedom, to beguile him by various arts of
deception,
and who exercise a tyrannical sway over the things of
this
world. Accordingly, in the system of these Sabæans,
the seven Planet-
Spirits, and the twelve Star-Spirits of
the zodiac, who sprang from an
irregular connection between
the cheated Fetahil and the Spirit of
Darkness, play an
important part in everything that is bad. The Demiurge
is a
limited and limiting being, proud, jealous, and revengeful; and this
his
character betrays itself in the Old Testament, which,
the Gnostics held,
came from him. They transferred to the
Demiurge himself, whatever in the
idea of God, as presented
by the Old Testament, appeared to them
defective. Against
his will and rule the was continually rebelling,
revolting
without control against the dominion which he, the
fashioner,
would exercise over it,
casting off the yoke
imposed on it, and destroying the work he had begun.
The
same jealous being, limited in his power, ruling with despotic
sway,
they imagined they saw in nature. He strives to check
the germination of
the divine seeds of life which the
Supreme God of Holiness and Love,
who has no connection
whatever with the sensible world, has scattered
among men.
That perfect God was at most known and worshipped
in
Mysteries by a few spiritual men.
The Gospel of
St. John is in great measure a polemic against
the
Gnostics, whose different sects, to solve the great
problems, the creation
of a material world by an immaterial
Being, the fall of man, the
incarnation, the redemption and
restoration of the spirits called men,
admitted a long
series of intelligences, intervening in a series of
spiritual
operations; and which they designated by the
names, The Beginning, the
Word, the Only-Begotten, Life,
Light, and Spirit [Ghost]: in Greek, ,
, Mo- and [Archë,
Logos, Monogenës, Zöe, ,
Phös, and Pneuma]. St. John, at
the beginning of his Gospel, avers that it
was Jesus Christ
who existed in the Beginning; that He was the WORD of
God
by which everything was made; that He was the Only-Begotten,
the
Life and the Light, and that He diffuses among men the
Holy Spirit [or
Ghost], the Divine Life and
Light.
So the Plëroma [ ], Plenitude or Fullness, was a
favorite term with
the Gnostics, and Truth and Grace were
the Gnostic Eons; and the
Simonians, Dokëtës, and other
Gnostics held that the Eon Christ Jesus
was never really,
but only apparently clothed with a human body: but St.
John
replies that the Word did really become Flesh, and dwelt among
us;
and that in Him were the Plëroma and Truth and
Grace.
In the doctrine of Valentinus, reared a Christian at
Alexandria, God was a
perfect Being, an Abyss [ . .
Buthos], which no intelligence could
sound, because no eye
could reach the invisible and ineffable heights on
which He
dwelt, and no mind could comprehend the duration of
His
existence; He has always been; He is the Primitive
Father and Beginning
and [the . . Propatör and Proarchë]:
He will BE always, and
does not grow old. The development
of His Perfections produced the
intellectual world. After
having passed infinite ages in repose and silence,
He
manifested Himself by His Thought, source of all His
manifestations,
and which received from Him the germ of
His
.. Ennoia] is also creations. Being of His Being, His Thought
[
termed [Charis], Grace or Joy, and , or [Sigë or
Arrëton],
Silence or the Ineffable. Its first manifestation
was [Nous], the
Intelligence, first of the Eons,
commencement of all things, first revelation
of the
Divinity, the [Monogenës], or Only-Begotten: next, Truth
[
- … Alëtheia], his companion. Their manifestations were the
Word
….Zoë] and theirs, Man and the Church and .. Logos]
and Life [ [
[ and …. Anthröpos and Ekklësia]: and from these,
other
twelve, six of whom were Hope, Faith, Charity,
Intelligence, Happiness,
and Wisdom; or, in the Hebrew,
Kesten, Kina, Amphe, Ouananim,
Thaedes, and Oubina. The
harmony of the Eons, struggling to know and
be united to
the Primitive God, was disturbed, and to redeem and
restore
them, the Intelligence [ ] produced Christ and the
Holy Spirit His
companion; who restored them to their first
estate of happiness and
harmony; and thereupon they formed
the Eon Jesus, born of a Virgin, to
whom the Christos
united himself in baptism and who, with his
Companion
Sophia-Achamoth, saved and redeemed the world.
The
Marcosians taught that the Supreme Deity produced by His words
the
[Logos] or Plenitude of Eons: His first utterance was a
syllable of
four letters, each of which became a being; His
second of four, His third of
ten, and His fourth of twelve:
thirty in all, which constituted the
f
[Plëroma].
The Valentinians, and others of the
Gnostics, distinguished three orders
of existences: - 1st.
The divine germs of life, exalted by their nature
above
matter, and akin to the (Sophia], to the mundane soul
and to the
Plëroma:- the spiritual natures, [Phuseis
Pneumatikai]: 2d.
The natures originating in the life,
divided from the former by the mixture
, - the psychical
natures, of the [Phuseis Psuchikai]; with
which begins a
perfectly new order of existence, an image of that
higher
mind and system, in a subordinate grade; and
finally, 3d. The Ungodlike
or Hylic Nature, which resists
all amelioration, and whose tendency is
only to destroy -
the nature of blind lust and passion.
The nature of
the
relationship with God (the
[pneumatikon], the
spiritual, is essential
…. Homo-ousion tö Theö):
hence
the life of Unity, the undivided, the
, absolutely
simple ( …. Ousia henike, monoeides).
[psuchikoi) is
disruption into multiplicity, The essence of
the
manifoldness; which, however, is subordinate to a
higher unity, by which it
allows itself to be guided, first
unconsciously, then consciously.
The essence of the
[Hulikoi] (of whom Satan is the head), is the
direct
opposite to all unity; disruption and disunion in itself, without
the
least sympathy, without any point of coalescence
whatever for unity;
together with an effort to destroy all
unity, to extend its own inherent
disunion to everything,
and to rend everything asunder. This principle has
no power
to posit anything; but only to negative: it is unable to create,
to
produce, to form, but only to destroy, to
decompose.
By Marcus, the disciple of Valentinus, the idea
of a [Logos
Tou Ontos], of a WORD, manifesting the hidden
Divine Essence, in the
Creation, was spun out into the most
subtle details - the entire creation
being, in his view, a
continuous utterance of the Ineffable. The way in
which the
germs of divine life [the …. spermata
pneumatika], which
lie shut up in the Eons, continually unfold
and
individualize them selves more and more, is represented
as a
spontaneous analysis of the several names of the
Ineffable, into their
several sounds. An echo of the
Plëroma falls down into the [HuIë], and
becomes the forming
of a new but lower creation.
One formula of the pneumatical
baptism among the Gnostics ran thus: "In
the NAME which is
hidden from all the Divinities and Powers" [of
the
Demiurge], "The Name of Truth" [the [Aletheial,
self-manifestation of
the Buthos], which Jesus of Nazareth
has put on in the light-zones of
Christ, the living Christ,
through the Holy Ghost, for the redemption of the
angels, -
the Name by which all things attain to Perfection." The
candidate
then said: "I am established and redeemed; I am
redeemed in my soul
from this world, and from all that
belongs to it, by the name of , who
has redeemed the Soul
of Jesus by the living Christ." The assembly then
said:
"Peace (or Salvation) to all on whom this name rests!"
The
boy Dionusos, torn in pieces, according to the Bacchic Mysteries,
by
the Titans, was considered by the Manicheans as simply
representing the
Soul, swallowed up by the powers of
dark-
ness, - the divine life rent into fragments by matter: -
that part of the
luminous essence of the primitive man [the
[Protos
Anthropos] of Mani, the [Praön Anthröpos] of
the
Valentinians, the Adam Kadmon of the Kabalah; and the
Kalomorts of the
Zendavesta], swallowed up by the powers of
darkness; the Mundane
Soul, mixed with matter - the seed of
divine life, which had fallen into
matter, and had thence
to undergo a process of purification
and
development.
The [Gnosis] of Carpocrates and
his son Epiphanes consisted in
the knowledge of one Supreme
Original being, the highest unity, from
whom all existence
has emanated, and to whom it strives to return. The
finite
spirits that rule over the several portions of the Earth, seek
to
counteract this universal tendency to unity; and from
their influence, their
laws, and arrangements, proceeds all
that checks, disturbs, or limits the
original communion,
which is the basis of nature, as the outward
manifestation
of that highest Unity. These spirits, moreover, seek to
retain
under their dominion the souls which, emanating from
the highest Unity,
and still partaking of its nature, have
lapsed into the corporeal world, and
have there been
imprisoned in bodies, in order, under their dominion, to
be
kept within the cycle of migration. From these finite spirits, the
popular
religions of different nations derive their origin.
But the souls which, from
a reminiscence of their former
condition, soar upward to the
contemplation of that higher
Unity, reach to such perfect freedom and
repose, as nothing
afterward can disturb or limit, and rise superior to
the
popular deities and religions. As examples of this
sort, they named
Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, and Christ.
They made no distinction
between the latter and the wise
and good men of every nation. They
taught that any other
soul which could soar to the same height of
contemplation,
might be regarded as equal with Him.
The Ophites commenced
their system with a Supreme Being, long
unknown to the
Human race, and still so the greater number of men;
the
[Buthos], or Profundity, Source of Light, and of
Adam-Kadmon, the
Primitive Man, made by the Demiourgos, but
perfected by the Supreme
God by the communication to him of
the Spirit [ . . Pneuma]. The first
emanation was the
Thought of the Supreme Deity [the .. Ennoia],
the
conception of the Universe in the Thought of God.
This Thought,
called also Silence ( . . Sigë), produced the Spirit [
..
Pneuma], Mother of the Living, and Wisdom of God. Together with
this
Primitive Existence, Matter existed also (the Waters,
Darkness, Abyss,
and Chaos), eternal like the Spiritual
Principle. Buthos and His Thought,
uniting with Wisdom,
made her fruitful by the Divine Light, and she
produced a
perfect and an imperfect being, Christos, and a Second
and
inferior wisdom, Sophia-Achamoth, who falling into
chaos remained
entangled there, became enfeebled, and lost
all knowledge of the
Superior Wisdom that gave her birth.
Communicating movement to
Chaos, she produced Ialdabaoth,
the Demiourgos, Agent of Material
Creation, and then
ascended toward her first place in the scale of
creation.
laldabaoth produced an angel that was his image, and this
a
second, and so on in succession to the sixth after the
Demiourgos: the
seven being reflections one of the other,
yet different and inhabiting
seven distinct regions. The
names of the six thus produced were IAO,
SABAOTH, ADONAI,
ELOI, ORAI, and ASTAPHAL Ialdabaoth, to become
independent
of his mother, and to pass for the Supreme Being, made
the
world, and man, in his own image; and his mother caused
the Spiritual
principle to pass from him into man so made;
and henceforward the
contest between the Demiourgos and his
mother, between light and
darkness, good and evil, was
concentrated in man; and the image of
Ialdabaoth, reflected
upon matter, became the Serpent-Spirit, Satan, the
Evil
Intelligence. Eve, created by Ialdabaoth, had by Us Sons
children
that were angels like themselves. The Spiritual
light was withdrawn from
man by Sophia, and the world
surrendered to the influence of evil; until
the Spirit,
urged by the entreaties of Wisdom, induced the Supreme
Being
to send Christos to redeem it. Compelled, despite
himself, by his Mother,
Ialdabaoth caused the man Jesus to
be born of a Virgin, and the Celestial
Saviour, uniting
with his Sister, Wisdom, descended through the regions
of
the seven angels, appeared in each under the form of its
chief,
concealed his own, and entered with his sister into
the man Jesus at the
baptism in Jordan. Ialdabaoth, finding
that Jesus was destroying his
empire and abolishing his
worship, caused the Jews to hate and crucify
Him; before
which happened, Christos and Wisdom had ascended to
the
celestial regions. They restored Jesus to life and gave
Him an ethereal
body, in which He remained eighteen months
on earth, and receiving from
Wisdom the per-
fect
knowledge [ …..Gnosis], communicated it to a small number
of
His apostles, and then arose to the intermediate region
inhabited by
laldabaoth, where, unknown to him, He sits at
his right hand, taking from
him the Souls of Light purified
by Christos. When nothing of the Spiritual
world shall
remain subject to laldabaoth, the redemption will
be
accomplished, and the end of the world, the completion
of the return of
Light into the Plenitude, will
occur.
Tatian adopted the theory of Emanation, of Eons, of
the existence of a
God too sublime to allow Himself to be
known, but displaying Himself by
Intelligences emanating
from His bosom. The first of these was His spirit
[ …..
Pneuma], God Himself, God thinking, God conceiving
the
Universe. The second was the Word [ … Logos], no longer
merely the
Thought or Conception, but the Creative
Utterance, manifestation of the
Divinity, but emanating
from the Thought or Spirit; the First-Begotten,
author of
the visible creation. This was the Trinity, composed of
the
Father, Spirit, and Word.
The Elxaïtes adopted
the Seven Spirits of the Gnostics; but named them
Heaven,
Water, Spirit, The Holy Angels of Prayer, Oil, Salt, and the
Earth.
The opinion of the Doketes as to the human nature of
Jesus Christ, was
that most generally received among the
Gnostics. They deemed the
intelligences of the Superior
World too pure and too much the antagonists
of matter, to
be willing to unite with it: and held that Christ, an
Intelligence
of the first rank, in appearing upon the
earth, did not become confounded
with matter, but took upon
Himself only the appearance of a body, or at
the most used
it only as an envelope.
Noëtus termed the Son the first
Utterance of the Father; the Word, not by
Himself, as an
Intelligence, and unconnected with the flesh, a real
Son;
but a Word, and a perfect Only-Begotten; light
emanated from the Light;
water flowing from its spring; a
ray emanated from the Sun.
Paul of Samosata taught that
Jesus Christ was the Son of Joseph and
Mary; but that the
Word, Wisdom, or Intelligence of God, the [Nous]
of the
Gnostics, had united itself with Him, so that He might be said to
be
at once the Son of God, and God Himself.
Arius
called the Saviour the first of creatures, non-emanated from
God,
but really created, by the direct will of God, before
time
and the ages. According to the Church, Christ was of the
same nature as
God; according to some dissenters, of the
same nature as man. Arius
adopted the theory of a nature
analogous to both. When God resolved to
create the Human
race, He made a Being which He called THE WORD,
THE SON,
WISDOM [ , , …. Logos, Uios, Sophia], to the end
that He
might give existence to men. This WORD is the Ormuzd
of
Zoroaster, the Ensoph of the Kabalah, the ; of Platonism
and
Philonism, and the or [Sophia or Demiourgos] of
the
Gnostics. He distinguished the Inferior Wisdom, or the
daughter, from the
Superior Wisdom; the latter being in
God, inherent in His nature, and
incapable of communication
to any creature: the second, by which the
Son was made,
communicated itself to Him, and therefore He Himself
was
entitled to be called the Word and the
Son.
Manes, founder of the Sect of the Manicheans, who had
lived and been
distinguished among the Persian Magi,
profited by the doctrines of
Scythianus, a Kabalist or
Judaizing Gnostic of the times of the Apostles;
and knowing
those of Bardesanes and Harmonius, derived his
doctrines
from Zoroasterism, Christianity, and Gnosticism.
He claimed to be the
[Paraklêtos] or Comforter, in the
Sense of a Teacher, organ of
the Deity, but not in that of
the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost: and commenced
his Epistola
Fundamenti in these words: "Manes, Apostle of Jesus
Christ,
elect of God the Father; Behold the Words of
Salvation, emanating from
the living and eternal fountain."
The dominant idea of his doctrine was
Pantheism, derived by
him from its source in the regions of India and on
the
confines of China: that the cause of all that exists is in God; and
at
last, God is all in all. All souls are equal - God is in
all, in men, animals,
and plants. There are two Gods, one
of Good and the other of Evil, each
independent, eternal,
chief of a distinct Empire; necessarily, and of their
very
natures, hostile to one another. The Evil God, Satan, is the Genius
of
matter alone. The God of Good is infinitely his
Superior, the True God;
while the other is but the chief of
all that is the Enemy of God, and must in
the end succumb
to His Power. The Empire of Light alone is eternal
and
true; and this Empire is a great chain of Emanations,
all connected with
the Supreme Being which they make
manifest; all Him, under different
forms, chosen for one
end, the triumph of the Good. In each
of His members lie hidden
thousands of ineffable treasures. Excellent in
His Glory,
incomprehensible in His Greatness, the Father has joined
to
Himself those fortunate, and glorious Eons [ . .
Aionês], whose
Power and Number it is impossible to
determine. This is Spinoza's Infinity
of Infinite
Attributes of God. Twelve Chief Eons, at the head of all,
were
the Genii of the twelve Constellations of the Zodiac,
and called by Manes,
Olamin. Satan, also, Lord of the
Empire of Darkness, had an Army of
Eons or Demons,
emanating from his Essence, and reflecting more or
less his
image, but divided and inharmonious among themselves. A
war
among them brought them to the confines of the Realm of
Light.
Delighted, they sought to conquer it. But the Chief
of the Celestial Empire
created a Power which he placed on
the frontiers of Heaven to protect his
Eons, and destroy
the Empire of Evil. This was the Mother of Life, the
Soul
of the World, an Emanation from the Supreme Being, too pure
to
come in immediate contact with matter. It remained in
the highest region;
but produced a Son, the first Man [the
Kaiomorts, Adam-Kadmon,
[Protos Anthropos,] and
Hivil-Zivah; of the Zend-Avesta, the
Kabalah, the Gnosis,
and Sabeism]; who commenced the contest with the
Powers of
Evil, but, losing part of his panoply, of his Light, his Son
and
many souls born of the Light, who were devoured by the
darkness, God
sent to his assistance the living Spirit, or
the Son of the First Man [
. . . Uios Anthropou], or Jesus
Christ. The Mother of Life, general
Principle of Divine
Life, and the first Man, Primitive being that reveals
the
Divine Life, are too sublime to be connected with the
Empire of Darkness.
The Son of Man or Soul of the World,
enters into the Darkness, becomes
its captive, to end by
tempering and softening its savage nature. The
Divine
Spirit, after having brought back the Primitive Man to the Empire
of
Light, raises above the world that part of the Celestial
Soul that remained
unaffected by being mingled with the
Empire of Darkness. Placed in the
region of the Sun and
Moon, this pure soul, the Son of Man, the
Redeemer or
Christ, labors to deliver and attract to Himself that part
of
the Light or of the Soul of the First Man diffused
through matter; which
done, the world will cease to exist.
To retain the rays of Light still
remaining among his Eons,
and ever tending to escape and return, by
concentrating
them, the Prince of Darkness, with their consent, made
Adam,
whose soul was of the Divine Light, contributed by the Eons,
and
his body of matter, so that he belonged to both
Empires, that of Light and
that of Darkness. To prevent the
light from escaping at once, the Demons
forbade Adam to eat
the fruit of "knowledge of good and evil," by which
he
would have known the Empire of Light and that of
Darkness. He obeyed;
an Angel of Light induced him to
transgress, and gave him the means of
victory; but the
Demons created Eve, who seduced him into an act
of
Sensualism, that enfeebled him, and bound him anew in
the bonds of
matter. This is repeated in the case of every
man that lives.
To deliver the soul, captive in darkness,
the Principle of Light, or Genius
of the Sun, charged to
redeem the Intellectual World, of which he is the
type,
came to manifest Himself among men. Light appeared in
the
darkness, but the darkness comprehended it not;
according to the words
of St. John. The Light could not
unite with the darkness. It but put on the
appearance of a
human body, and took the name of Christ in the
Messiah,
only to accommodate itself to the language of the Jews.
The
Light did its work, turning the Jews from the adoration
of the Evil
Principle, and the Pagans from the worship of
Demons. But the Chief of
the Empire of Darkness caused Him
to be crucified by the Jews. Still He
suffered in
appearance only, and His death gave to all souls the
symbol
of their enfranchisement. The person of Jesus having
disappeared, there
was seen in His place a cross of Light,
over which a celestial voice
pronounced these words: "The
cross of Light is called The Word, Christ,
The Gate, Joy,
The Bread, The Sun, The Resurrection, Jesus, The
Father,
The Spirit, Life, Truth, and Grace."
With the
Priscillianists there were two principles, one the Divinity,
the
other, Primitive Matter and Darkness; each eternal.
Satan is the son and
lord of matter; and the secondary
angels and demons, children of matter.
Satan created and
governs the visible world. But the soul of man
emanated
from God, and is of the same substance with God. Seduced
by
the evil spirits, it passes through various bodies,
until, purified and
reformed, it rises to God and is
strengthened by His light. These powers
of evil hold
mankind in ledge; and to redeem this pledge, the
Saviour,
Christ the Redeemer, came and died upon the cross
of expiation, thus
discharging the written obligation. He,
like all souls, was of the
same substance with God, a
manifestation of the Divinity, no forming a
second person;
unborn, like the Divinity, and nothing else than
the
Divinity under another form.
It is useless to
trace these vagaries further; and we stop at the frontiers
of
the realm of the three hundred and sixty-five thousand
emanations of the
Mandaîtes from the Primitive Light, Fira
or Ferho and Yavar; and return
contentedly to the simple
and sublime creed of Masonry.
Such were some of the ancient
notions concerning the Deity and taken in
connection with
what has been detailed in the preceding Degrees,
this
Lecture affords you a true picture of the ancient
speculations. From the
beginning until now, those who have
undertaken to solve the great
mystery of the creation of a
material universe by an Immaterial Deity,
have interposed
between the two, and between God and man,
divers
manifestations of, or emanations from, or
personified attributes or agents
of, the Great Supreme God,
who is coexistent with Time and coextensive
with
Space.
The universal belief of the Orient was, that the
Supreme Being did not
Himself create either the earth or
man. The fragment which commences
the Book of Genesis,
consisting of the first chapter and the three first
verses
of the second, assigns the creation or rather the formation
or
modelling of the world from matter already existing in
confusion, not to
lHUH, but to the ALHIM, well known as
Subordinate Deities, Forces, or
Manifestations, among the
Phœnicians. The second fragment imputes it
to IHUH-ALHIM,*
and St. John assigns the creation to the or WORD;
and
asserts that CHRIST was that WORD, as well as LIGHT and
LIFE,
other emanations from the Great Primeval Deity, to
which other faiths had
assigned the work of
creation.
An absolute existence, wholly immaterial, in no
way within the reach of
our senses; a cause, but not an
effect that never was not, but existed
during an infinity
of eternities, before there was anything else except
Time
and Space, is wholly beyond the reach of our
conceptions. The mind of
man has wearied itself in
speculations as to His nature, His essence, His
attributes;
and ended in being no wiser than it began. In the
impossibility
of conceiving of immateriality, we feel at
sea and lost whenever we go
beyond the domain of matter.
And yet we know that there are Power
* The Substance, or
Very Self, of which the Alohayim are the manifestations.
Forces,
Causes, that are themselves not matter. We give them
names,
but what they really are, and what their essence, we
are wholly ignorant.
But, fortunately, it does not follow
that we may not believe, or even know,
that which we cannot
explain to ourselves, or that which is beyond the
reach of
our comprehension. If we believed only that which our
intellect
can grasp, measure, comprehend, and have distinct
and clear ideas of,
we should believe scarce anything. The
senses are not the witnesses that
bear testimony to us of
the loftiest truths.
Our greatest difficulty is, that
language is not adequate to express our
ideas; because our
words refer to things, and are images of what
is
substantial and material. If we use the word
“emanation," our mind
involuntarily recurs to something
material, flowing out of some other thing
that is material;
and if we reject this idea of materiality, nothing is left
of
the emanation but an unreality. The word "thing" itself
suggests to us that
which is material and within the
cognizance and jurisdiction of the senses.
If we cut away
from it the idea of materiality, it presents itself to us as
no
thing, but an intangible unreality, which the mind
vainly endeavors to
grasp. Existence and Being are terms
that have the same color of
materiality; and when we speak
of a Power or Force, the mind
immediately images to itself
one physical and material thing acting upon
another.
Eliminate that idea; and the Power or Force, devoid of
physical
characteristics, seems as unreal as the shadow
that dances on a wall,
itself a mere absence of light; as
spirit is to us merely that which is
not
matter.
Infinite space and infinite time are
the two primary ideas. We formulize
them thus: add body to
body and sphere to sphere, until the imagination
wearies;
and still there will remain beyond, avoid, empty,
unoccupied
SPACE, limitless, because it is void. Add event
to event in continuous
succession, forever and forever, and
there will still remain, before and
after, a TIME in which
there was and will be no event, and also endless
because it
too is void.
Thus these two ideas of the boundlessness of
space and the endlessness
of time seem to involve the ideas
that matter and events are limited and
finite. We cannot
conceive of an infinity of worlds or of events; but only
of
an indefinite number of each; for. as we struggle to
conceive of their
infinity, the thought ever occurs in
despite of all our efforts - there must be
space in
which
there are no worlds; there must have been time when there
were no events.
We cannot conceive how, if this earth moves
millions of millions of miles a
million times repeated, it
is still in the centre of space; nor how, if we
lived
millions of millions of ages and centuries, we should
still be in the centre of
eternity - with still as much
space on one side as on the other; with still as
much time
before us as behind; for that seems to say that the world has
not
moved nor we lived at all.
Nor can we
comprehend how an infinite series of worlds, added together,
is
no larger than an infinite series of atoms; or an
infinite series of centuries
no longer than an infinite
series of seconds; both being alike infinite, and
therefore
one series containing no more nor fewer units than the
other.
Nor have we the capacity to form in ourselves any
idea of that which is
immaterial. We use the word, but it
conveys to us on1v the idea of the
absence and negation of
materiality; which vanishing, Space and Time
alone,
infinite and boundless, seem to us to be left.
We cannot
form any conception of an effect without a cause. We
cannot
but believe, indeed we know, that, how far soever we
may have to run back
along the chain of effects and causes,
it cannot be infinite; but we must
come at last to
something which is not an effect, but the first cause: and
vet
the fact is literaltv beyond our comprehension. The
mind refuses to grasp
the idea of self-existence, of
existence without a beginning. As well expect
the hair that
grows upon our head to understand the nature and
immortality
of the soul.
It does not need to go so
far in search of mysteries; nor have we any right
to
disbelieve or doubt the existence of a Great First Cause, itself no
effect,
because we cannot comprehend it; because the words
we use do not even
express it to us adequately.
We
rub a needle for a little while, on a dark, inert mass of iron ore,
that had
lain idle in the earth for many centuries.
Something is thereby
communicated to the steel - we term it
a virtue, a power, or a quality - and
then we balance it
upon a pivot; and, lo! drawn by some invisible,
mysterious
Power, one pole of the needle turns to the North, and there
the
same Power keeps the same pole for days and years; will
keep it there,
perhaps, as long as the world lasts, carry
the needle where you will, and no
matter what seas
or
mountains intervene between it and the North Pole of the
world. And this
Power, thus acting, and indicating to the
mariner his course over the
trackless ocean, when the stars
shine not for many days, saves vessels
from shipwreck,
families from distress, and those from sudden death
on
whose lives the fate of nations and the peace of the
world depend. But for
it, Napoleon might never have reached
the ports of France on his return
from Egypt, nor Nelson
lived to fight and win at Trafalgar. Men call this
Power
Magnetism, and then complacently think that they have
explained
it all; and yet they have but given a new name to
an unknown thing, to
hide their ignorance. What is this
wonderful Power? It is a real, actual,
active Power: that
we know and see. But what its essence is, or how it
acts,
we do not know, any more than we know the essence or the mode
of
action of the Creative Thought and Word of
God.
And again, what is that which we term galvanism and
electricity, - which,
evolved by the action of a little
acid on two metals, aided by a magnet,
circles the earth in
a second, sending from land to land the Thoughts
that
govern the transactions of individuals and nations?
The mind has formed
no notion of matter, that will include
it; and no name that we can give it,
helps us to understand
its essence and its being. It is a Power, like
Thought and
the Will. We know no more.
What is this power of
gravitation that makes everything upon the earth
tend to
the centre? How does it reach out its invisible hands toward
the
erratic meteor-stones, arrest them in their swift
course, and draw them
down to the earth's bosom? It is a
power. We know no more.
What is that heat which plays so
wonderful a part in the world's economy?
- that caloric,
latent everywhere, within us and without us, produced
by
combustion, by intense pressure, and by swift motion? Is
it substance,
matter, spirit, or immaterial, a mere Force
or State of Matter?
And what is light? A substance, say the
books, - matter, that travels to us
from the sun and stars,
each ray separable into seven, by the prism, of
distinct
colors, and with distinct peculiar qualities and actions. And if
a
substance, what is its essence, and what power is
inherent in it, by which
it journeys incalculable myriads
of miles, and reaches us ten thousand
years or more after
it leaves the stars?
All power is equally a mystery. Apply
intense cold to a drop of water in the
centre of a globe of
iron, and the globe is shattered as the water
freezes.
Confine a little of the same limpid element in a
cylinder which Enceladus or
Typhon could not have risen
asunder, and apply to it intense heat, and the
vast power
that couched latent in the water shivers the cylinder to atoms.
A
little shoot from a minute seed, a shoot so soft and
tender that the least
bruise would kill it, forces its way
downward into the hard, earth, to the
depth of many feet,
with an energy wholly incomprehensible. What are
these
mighty forces, locked up in the small seed and the drop of
water?
Nay, what is LIFE itself, with all its wondrous,
mighty energies, - that power
which maintains the heat
within us, and prevents our bodies, that decay so
soon
without it, from resolution into their original elements - Life,
that
constant miracle, the nature and essence whereof have
eluded all the
philosophers; and all their learned
dissertations on it are a mere jargon of
words?
No
wonder the ancient Persians thought that Light and Life were one, -
both
emanations from the Supreme Deity, the archetype of
light. No wonder that
in their ignorance they worshipped
the Sun. God breathed into man the
spirit of life, - not
matter, but an emanation from Himself; not a creature
made
by Him, nor a distinct existence, but a Power, like His own
Thought:
and light, to those great-souled ancients, also
seemed no creature, and no
gross material substance, but a
pure emanation from the Deity, immortal
and indestructible
like Himself.
What, indeed, is REALITY? Our dreams are as
real, while they last, as the
occurrences of the daytime.
We see, hear, feel, act, experience pleasure
and suffer
pain, as vividly and actually in a dream as when awake.
The
occurrences and transactions of a year are crowded into
the limits of a
second: and the dream remembered is as real
as the past occurrences of
life.
The philosophers
tell us that we have no cognizance of substance itself,
but
only of its attributes: that when we see that which we
call a block of marble,
our perceptions give us information
only of something extended, solid,
colored, heavy, and the
like; but not of the very thing itself, to which
these
attributes belong. And yet the attributes do not
exist without the substance.
They are not substances, but
adjectives. There is no such thing or
existence as
hardness, weight or color, by itself, detached from any
subject,
moving first here, then there, and attaching itself to this and to
the
other subject. And yet, they say, the attributes are
not the subject.
So Thought, Volition, and Perception are
not the soul, but its attributes;
and we have no cognizance
of the soul itself, but only of them, its
manifestations.
Nor of God; but only of His Wisdom, Power,
Magnificence,
Truth, and other attributes.
And yet we know that there is
matter, a soul within our body, a God that
lives in the
Universe.
Take, then, the attributes of the soul. I am
conscious that I exist and am
the same identical person
that I was twenty years ago. I am conscious
that my body is
not I, - that if my arms were lopped away, this person
that
I call ME, would still remain, complete, entire,
identical as before. But I
cannot ascertain, by the most
intense and long-continued reflection, what
I am, nor where
within my body I reside, nor whether I am a point, or
an
expanded substance. I have no power to examine and
inspect. I exist, will,
think, perceive. That I know, and
nothing more. I think a noble and
sublime Thought. What is
that Thought? It is not Matter, nor Spirit. It is
not a
Thing; but a Power and Force. I make upon a paper
certain
conventional marks, that represent that Thought.
There is no Power or
Virtue in the marks I write, but only
in the Thought which they tell to
others. I die, but the
Thought still lives. It is a Power. It acts on men,
excites
them to enthusiasm, inspires patriotism, governs their
conduct,
controls their destinies, disposes of life and
death. The words I speak are
but a certain succession of
particular sounds, that by conventional
arrangement
communicate to others the Immaterial, Intangible,
Eternal
Thought. The fact that Thought continues to exist
an instant, after it
makes its appearance in the soul,
proves it immortal: for there is nothing
conceivable that
can destroy it. The spoken words, being mere sounds,
may
vanish into thin air, and the written ones, mere marks, be
burned,
erased, destroyed: but the THOUGHT itself lives
still, and must live on
forever.
A Human Thought,
then, is an actual EXISTENCE, and a FORCE and
POWER,
capable of acting upon and controlling matter as well as mind.
Is
not the existence of a God, who is the immaterial soul
of the Universe,
and whose THOUGHT, embodied or not
embodied in His WORD, is an
Infinite Power, of Creation and
pro-
duction, destruction and preservation, quite as
comprehensible as the
existence of a Soul, of a Thought
separated from the Soul, of the Power
of that Thought to
mould the fate and influence the Destinies
of
Humanity?
And yet we know not when that Thought
comes, nor what it is. It is not
WE. We do not mould it,
shape it, fashion it. It is neither our mechanism
nor our
invention. It appears spontaneously, flashing, as it were, into
the
soul, making that soul the involuntary instrument of
its utterance to the
world. It comes to us, and seems a
stranger to us, seeking a home.
As little can we explain
the mighty power of the human WILL, Volition, like
Thought,
seems spontaneous, an effect without a cause.
Circumstances
provoke it, and serve as its occasion, but do
not produce it. It springs up
in the soul, like Thought, as
the waters gush upward in a spring. Is it the
manifestation
of the soul, merely making apparent what passes within
the
soul, or an emanation from it, going abroad and acting
outwardly, itself a
real Existence, as it is an admitted
Power? We can but own our
ignorance. It is certain that it
acts on other souls, controls, directs them,
shapes their
action, legislates for men and nations: and yet it is
not
material nor visible; and the laws it writes merely n
one soul of what has
passed within another.
God,
therefore, is a mystery, only as everything that surrounds us, and
as
we ourselves, are mysteries. We know that there is and
must be a FIRST
CAUSE. His attributes, severed from
Himself, are unrealities. As color and
extension, weight
and hardness, do not exist apart from matter as
separate
existences and substantives, spiritual or immaterial; so
the
Goodness, Wisdom, justice, Mercy, and Benevolence of
God are not
independent existences, personify them as men
may, but attributes of the
Deity, the adjectives of One
Great Substantive. But we know that He must
be Good, True,
Wise, Just, Benevolent, Merciful: and in all these, and
all
His other attributes, Perfect and Infinite; because we
are conscious that
these are laws imposed on us by the very
nature of things, necessary,
and without which the Universe
would be confusion and the existence of a
God incredible.
They are of His essence, and necessary, as His
existence
is.
. . Estos], of Simon Magus,
the
He is the Living, Thinking, Intelligent SOUL of the
Universe, the
PERMANENT, the STATIONARY[
ONE that
always is [To To ON] of Plato, as
contradistinguished from
the perpetual flux and reflux, or Genesis, of things.
And,
as the Thought of the Soul, emanating from the Soul, becomes audible
and
visible in Words, so did THE THOUGHT OF GOD, springing
up within Himself,
immortal as Himself, when once
conceived, - immortal before, because in
Himself, utter
Itself in THE WORD, its manifestation and mode
of
communication, and thus create the Material, Mental,
Spiritual Universe, which,
like Him, never began to
exist.
This is the real idea of the Ancient Nations: GOD,
the Almighty Father, and
Source of All; His THOUGHT,
conceiving the whole Universe, and willing its
creation:
His WORD, uttering that THOUGHT, and thus becoming the Creator
or
Demiourgos, in the whom was Life and Light, and that
Light the Life of the
Universe.
Nor did that Word
cease at the single act of Creation; and having set going
the
great machine, and enacted the laws of its motion and
progression, of birth and
life, and change and death, cease
to exist, or remain thereafter in inert idleness.
FOR THE
THOUGHT OF GOD LIVES AND IS IMMORTAL. Embodied in the
WORD,
is not only created, but it preserves. It conducts and controls
the
Universe, all spheres, all worlds, all actions of
mankind, and of every animate
and inanimate creature. It
speaks in the soul of every man who lives. The Stars,
the
Earth, the Trees, the Winds, the universal voice of Nature, tempest,
and
avalanche, the Sea's roar and the grave voice of the
waterfall, the hoarse
thunder and the low whisper of the
brook, the song of birds, the voice of love,
the speech of
men, all are the alphabet in which it communicates itself to
men,
and informs them of the will and law of God, the Soul
of the Universe. And thus
most truly did "THE WORD BECOME
PLESH AND DWELL AMONG MEN."
God, the unknown FATHER [
…Pater Agnõstos], known to us only
by His Attributes; the
ABSOLUTE I AM:.. The THOUGHT of God [ .
Ennoia], and the
WORD [ .... Logos], Manifestation and expression of
the
Thought; . . . . Behold THE TRUE MASONIC TRINITY; the
UNIVERSAL SOUL,
the THOUGHT in the Soul, the WORD, or
Thought expressed; the THREE TN
ONE, of a Trinitarian
Ecossais.
Here Masonry pauses, and leaves its Initiates to
carry out and develop these
great Truths in such manner as
to each may seem
most accordant with reason, philosophy, truth,
and his religious faith. It
declines to act as Arbiter
between them. It looks calmly on, while each
multiplies the
intermediates between the Deity and Matter, and
the
personifications of God's manifestations and
attributes, to whatever extent
his reason, his conviction,
or his fancy dictates.
While the Indian tells us that
PARABRAHMA, BRAHM, and PARATMA
were the first Triune God,
revealing Himself as BRAHMA, VISHNU, and
SIVA, Creator,
Preserver, and Destroyer; ....
The Egyptian, of AMUN-RE,
NEITH, and PHTHA, Creator, Matter, Thought
or Light; the
Persian of his Trinity of Three Powers in ORMUZD, Sources
of
Light, Fire, and Water; the Buddhists of the God SAKYA,
a Trinity
composed of BUDDHA, DHARM and SANGA, -
Intelligence, Law, and
Union or Harmony; the Chinese
Sabeans of their Trinity of Chang-ti, the
Supreme
Sovereign; Tien, the Heavens; and Tao, the Universal
Supreme
Reason and Principle of all things; who produced
the Unit; that, two; two,
three; and three, all that is;
....
While the Sclavono-Vend typifies his Trinity by the
three heads of the God
Triglav; the Ancient Prussian points
to his Triune God, Perkoun, Pikollos,
and Potrimpos,
Deities of Light and Thunder, of Hell and of the Earth;
the
Ancient Scandinavian to Odin, Frea, and Thor; and the
old Etruscans to
TINA, TALNA, and MINIMVA, Strength,
Abundance, and Wisdom; ....
While Plato tells us of the
Supreme Good, the Reason or Intellect, and the
], and the
Soul or Spirit; and Philo of the Archetype of Light, Wisdom
[
os the Kabalists, of the Triads of the Sephiroth; . Word
[
While the disciples of Simon Magus, and the many sects of
the Gnostics,
confuse us with their Eons, Emanations,
Powers, Wisdom Superior and
Inferior, Ialdabaoth,
Adam-Kadmon, even to the three hundred and
sixtyfive
thousand emanations of the Maldaites;
....
And while the pious Christian believes that the WORD
dwelt in the Mortal
Body of Jesus of Nazareth, and suffered
upon the Cross; and that the
HOLY GHOST was poured out upon
the Apostles, and now inspires every
truly Christian Soul:
. . . .
While all these faiths assert their claims to the
exclusive possession of the
Truth, Masonry inculcates its
old doctrine, and no more: .... That God is
ONE; that His
THOUGHT uttered in His
WORD, created the Universe, and preserves
it by those Eternal Laws
which are the expression of that
Thought: that the Soul of Man, breathed
into him by God, is
immortal as His Thoughts are; that he is free to do evil
or
to choose good, responsible for his acts and punishable for his
sins:
that all evil and wrong and suffering are but
temporary, the discords of
one great Harmony, and that in
His good time they will lead by infinite
modulations to the
great, harmonic final chord and cadence of Truth,
Love,
Peace, and Happiness, that will ring forever and ever under
the
Arches of Heaven, among all the Stars and Worlds, and
in all souls of
men and Angels.
