The "shutdown" of the US government and the financial climax
associated with a deadline date, leading to a possible "debt
default" of the federal government is a money making
undertaking for Wall Street.
Several overlapping political and economic agendas are
unfolding. Is the shutdown - implying the furloughing of tens
of thousands of public employees - a dress rehearsal for the
eventual privatization of important components of the
federal State system?
A
staged default, bankruptcy and privatization is occurring in
Detroit (with the active support of the Obama
administration), whereby large corporations become the
owners of municipal assets and infrastructure.
The important question: Could a process of "State
bankruptcy" - which is currently afflicting local level
governments across the land - realistically occur in the case
of the central government of the United States of America?
This is not a hypothetical question. A large number of
developing countries under the brunt of IMF "economic
medicine" were ordered by their external creditors to
dismantle the State apparatus, fire millions of public
sector workers as well as privatize State assets.
The IMF Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) has also been
applied in several European countries.
Will this gamut of deadly macro-economic reforms engineered
by Wall Street and the Federal Reserve be conducive to
widespread civil disorder across the United States?
While the declaration of a national emergency or martial law
is not envisaged, reports confirm that the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) is currently,
"engaged in acquiring
heavily armored tanks, which have been seen roaming the
streets."
In the words of
Ellen Brown,
"somebody in government is expecting some
serious civil unrest
"
Fiscal Collapse
Flash back to the meltdown of Wall Street in
September 2008. In the wake of the economic crisis, a process of fiscal
collapse was initiated.
The evolving fiscal crisis had set the stage. It
has a direct bearing on the issue of shutdown of the federal government and
"debt default".
The
Bush and
Obama bank bailouts had led to the
appropriation of $1.45 trillion of US tax revenues. This money was
channeled to Wall Street under Bushs Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP)
and Obamas bailout program initiated at the outset of his first term. This
money was transferred to the banks.
Meanwhile, "defense expenditure" in support of a
war economy had spiraled:
740 billion dollars had been allocated (FY 2010)
to fund a vast process of militarization including America's wars in the
Middle East and Central Asia.
"Black Budgets"
Of significance, there were several other
unreported shadowy multibillion dollar bailouts which do not appear in
government accounts, not to mention the Pentagons black budgets which are
not included in the official expenditure accounts of the Department of
Defense.
According to
Aviation Week in a 2009 report:
"the Pentagons black operations,
including the intelligence budgets nested inside it, are roughly equal in
magnitude to the entire defense budgets of the UK, France or Japan, and 10
per cent of the total."

Programs in 2010

"War and Wall Street":
Spiraling Public Debt
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis,
a new structure of public indebtedness had been created.
Without accounting
for
the "black budgets"
and "shadowy bank bailouts", reported defense
expenditures plus the bank bailouts amounted to a staggering
2.35
trillion dollars. Total revenue in FY
2010 was of the order of $2.38 trillion.
In other words,
these two categories of expenditure, namely War and Wall Street "had eaten
up" (together with interest payments on the public debt) the totality of
federal government revenues.
The $2.35 trillion included the handouts to the
banks plus military expenditure and the funding of the multibillion dollar
DoD contracts with,
-
Lockheed Martin
-
Raytheon
-
Northrop Grumman
-
British
Aerospace,
...et al.
No Money Left Over From
the Public Purse to Fund Regular Government Programs
What this warped budgetary structure implied (in
FY 2009 and 2010) was that there was no money (i.e. residual funds) "left
over" from the public purse (tax revenues and other sources of federal
government revenue) to fund regular government programs.
All other categories of expenditure
including medicare, medicaid, social security as well as public investments
in infrastructure, etc. had to be financed through debt creation (emission
of Treasury bills and government bonds), namely through
a dramatic increase in the public debt from $9.9 trillion in FY 2008 to 16.7
trillion (October 2013), a staggering increase of almost 70 percent.
In essence, the federal government has been
financing it own indebtedness through generous handouts to Wall Street and
the military industrial complex.
Widening Budget Deficit
These developments are also characterized by a
widening budget deficit in the wake of
the 2008 financial
crash. (See CBO graphs below, which indicate the figures for the budget
deficit as well as the forecast for 2012-2022).
The Congress Budget Office (CBO) contends that
the "estimates" for 2013-2022 are based on revised historical values of
Gross Domestic Product by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This is a
nonsensical statement.
Yet the Congress Budget Office also
acknowledges that,
"the federal budget deficits [2013-2022] are now
expected to shrink dramatically".
These are not our words but those
of the CBO. And these "forecasts" have nothing to do with revised
historical values of GDP.
The have to do with austerity measures and
macro-economic policy.
Budgetary Shift -
"Economic Shock Therapy"
In a matter of three years, according to
the CBO "forecast", the budget deficit will
be reduced from 7 percent of GDP in 2012 to 2 percent in 2015.
A budgetary shift of this nature can only be
implemented by "economic shock therapy" leading to socially devastating cuts
in public expenditure, which will inevitably result in a wave of civil
unrest.
Built into these "forecasts" is the presumption
that drastic austerity measures leading to major cuts in government spending
will be carried out over a ten year period (2013-2022) thereby reducing the
size of the budget deficit as well as its percentage ratio to GDP.
We are
not dealing with statistical concepts, the CBO "forecasts" through these
2013-20122 figures a process of fiscal disintegration and impoverishment of
the American people.
Medicare, Medicaid,
Social Security
The so-called CBO "estimates" for 2013-2022 are
based on the assumption that austerity measures (which have not yet been
formally adopted) will lead to the downsizing, phasing out and/or
privatization of a large number of State programs including medicare,
medicaid and social security.
How else would it be possible to slash the
budget deficit from 7 to 2 percent of GDP in 3 fiscal years?
Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security
represented in FY 2012, 45 percent of total government expenditure (See CBO
Chart on Federal Government Spending for FY 2012, below).
It is highly unlikely that the budget of the
Department of Defense (19 percent) will be used to reduce the budget
deficit.
Quantitative Easing -
"Keeping the Ship Afloat"
In a bitter irony, while the Wall Street
financial institutions were the recipients of the bailouts, they are also
the creditors of the federal government, which had been precipitated into a
structure of deficit financing controlled by Wall Street.
This deficit
financing - which was facilitated by
Quantitative easing - is distinct from
the Keynesian framework. It is controlled by the creditors. It does not
create employment, it is not expansionary. It has little bearing on the real
economy.
This post 2008 fiscal structure has had a
fundamental impact on the process of debt formation.
Tax and other federal
government revenues had been assigned in 2008-2009 to bailing out the banks while relentlessly funding the war economy including the financing through
black budgets of a growing number of Private
military and security companies (PMSC).
The public debt has increased by
almost 70 percent in five years, from 9.9
trillion in 2008 to 16.7 trillion in 2013 (October 2013 estimate of the debt
ceiling, see graphs above).
The various phases of
Quantitative Easing (QE) throughout the Obama presidency were
largely intended by Wall Street to keep the ship afloat, with an
increasingly larger share of the debt owned by
the Federal Reserve (in the
form of Treasury bills).
The Fed has largely been involved in propping up its assets.
Under QE,
tens of billions of dollars are injected into financial markets.
Quantitative easing has not resulted in a positive stimulus of the real
economy.
"The real goal of the Federal Reserve
is to guarantee
the continual profitability of Wall Street and the personal incomes of the
super-rich."
The Fed is not a publicly owned central bank; it
is a network of 12 private US banks, with the New York Federal Reserve Bank
playing a key role.
Operating under a semi-secret veil, major Wall Street
financial institutions (including the big four) are the "stakeholders" of
the Federal Reserve, which ultimately call the shots on Capitol Hill.
At the
outset of the Obama administration in 2009, The Federal Reserve Banking
system (which is an unaccountable private entity) has been granted increased
authority in its management of the US economy, overshadowing the prevailing
system of public regulation of the financial system, as well as reinforcing
the subordinate role of the US Treasury in relation to Wall Street.
Policies pertaining to the shutdown of the
government and the statutory debt ceiling are determined by Wall Street and
the Federal Reserve, the US governments largest creditor.
The
Federal Reserve banks currently holds $2.1 trillion of US public debt. Japan
and China respectively own 1.1 trillion and 1.3 trillion of the US public
debt.
Based on Jun 2012 figures, The Federal Reserve owns 16
percent of the Federal Debt held by the Public.
The New York Federal Reserve Bank (the largest
of the Federal Reserve banks) holds a significant portion of the total
holdings of the Federal Reserve system composed of 12 constituent banks.

Were the Federal Reserve to be a publicly owned
central bank, quantitative easing would have an entirely different dynamics:
the government rather than the Fed (acting on behalf of Wall Street) would
be calling the shots.
Under a publicly owned central banking arrangement,
two trillion dollars worth of public debt could be cancelled, thereby
creating conditions for the funding of social programs.
The result of these macroeconomic reforms has
been mass unemployment.
The American people - including the middle class
- have been impoverished by the Wall Street establishment, which ultimately
decides on debt default and the statutory ceiling placed on the public debt.
Under pressure from Wall Street and
the Federal
Reserve, the choices of the US government are limited to the following
options:
State programs can either be downsized, phased
out or transferred out of the public purse to the private corporate sector,
implying in all cases the layoff of tens of thousands of public employees.
No major reforms of the structure of
indebtedness are contemplated by the US Congress, which could meaningfully
change the governments relationship to the Federal Reserve and its Wall
Street handlers. The creditors ultimately decide.
What is contemplated are marginal modifications
of the status quo including legislation to push the debt limit to December
31st 2014.
This token arrangement would temporarily
increase the federal governments borrowing ability through the issuing of
Treasury bills and government bonds by about one trillion dollars. Under
this scheme, however, the powers of the Wall Street Banks and the New York
Federal Reserve would not only be maintained they would be reinforced.
The ultimate objective is to develop a
full-fledged proxy State under the helm of the financial establishment.
Both
the Executive as well as the US Congress are to remain under the control of
Wall Street.
The Privatization of the
American State?
The inevitable scenario established in the wake
of the 2008 crisis is fiscal collapse, leading to:
the possible phasing out and/or curtailment of
social programs, the privatization of large sectors of public sector
activity.
The fiscal ceiling having now been reached,
possibly with a deadline, the government is being pressured by its Wall
Street handlers - who control decision-making in the US Congress - to curtail
and downsize social programs as well as initiate the transfer of public
assets and institutions into the hands of private corporations.
There is
also a movement to cut as well as privatize Social Security and Medicare.
The privatization of public monuments, museums,
national parks, the post office, etc. has been raised in recent media
reports as a possible "solution" to the debt crisis. But let us not be
misled: the process of acquisition of federal public property including
infrastructure and State institutions is likely to go much further.
The public sector is up for grabs. Wall Street
will eventually go on a buying spree picking up State owned assets at rock
bottom prices.
Ironically, the money transferred by the US
government to Wall Street under the bailouts in 2008-2009 can now be used by
Wall Street to buy out state property and assets. What this means is that
the federal government not only finances its own indebtedness, it is also
financing the privatization program (at tax payers expense), leading to the
demise of federal government programs.
This process of privatization of the State is
nothing new, it has been applied in developing countries under the helm of
the IMF whereby state corporations are auctioned off and transferred into
the hands of foreign corporations. It has also been applied in Eastern
Europe as well more recently in several countries of the European Union
The proceeds of the privatization program are
channeled to the State Treasury to meet outstanding debt obligations.
In
Brazil in the 1990s, important state assets in mining and forestry were
purchased by Citi Group, which was Brazils largest foreign creditor bank.
Ironically, the proceeds of the privatization of the assets purchased by
Citi Group were channeled back to Citi Group in the form of debt servicing.
Existing state programs are transferred to
private corporations either through outright sale of state assets or through
outsourcing of government services to the private sector.
Large numbers of government employees would be
laid off as a result of restructuring and privatization.
Government
services would be sold to the public at a much higher price.
The Privatization of
American Cities
The takeover of State assets in America is well
under way largely at the municipal and state level.
We recall Orange county
which went bankrupt in 1994, Jefferson County, Alabama which filed for
Chapter 9 bankruptcy in 2011, and more recently Detroit in 2013. In these
and other county/municipal bankruptcies, public assets, lands and
infrastructure are sold off to private investors.
Across the US, more than
100 municipalities are facing bankruptcy:
All over the United States, politicians are
selling off key pieces of infrastructure to foreign investors and big
Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs are helping them do it.
State and
local governments across the country that are drowning in debt and that
are desperate for cash are increasingly turning to the "privatization"
of public assets as the solution to their problems. Pieces of
infrastructure that taxpayers have already paid for such as highways,
water treatment plants, libraries, parking meters, airports and power
plants are being auctioned off to the highest bidder.
Most of the time
what happens is that the state or local government receives a huge lump
sum of cash up front for a long-term lease (usually 75 years or longer)
and the foreign investors come in and soak as much revenue out of the
piece of infrastructure that they possibly can. The losers in these
deals are almost always the taxpayers.
Pieces of America are literally
being auctioned off just to help state and local governments minimize
their debt problems for a year or two, but the consequences of these
deals will be felt for decades.
(Michael Snyder,
American Dream, July 6, 2011)
The bankruptcies of local level governments
immediately backlash on pension funds:
In California, the Orange County Employees
Retirement System is estimated to have a
10 billion dollar unfunded pension liability
.
How in the world can a single county be
facing a 10 billion dollar hole?
The state of Illinois is facing an unfunded
pension liability
of more than 77 billion dollars. Considering the fact that the
state of Illinois is flat broke and on the verge of default, it is
inevitable that a lot of those pension obligations will never be paid.
Pension consultant Girard Miller told
Californias Little Hoover Commission that state and local government
bodies in the state of California have
$325 billion in combined unfunded pension
liabilities.
That comes to about $22,000 for every single
working adult in the state of California.
(See
Vanishing Pensions: All Over America Old Age Pensions Are Being Slashed
or Eliminated, Global Research, March 14, 2012)
The privatization of federal State assets on a
significant scale as well as the take over and privatization of public
services is the next stage of this socially devastating economic
restructuring process.
Speculative Onslaught
There is another related agenda, which will be
the object of a forthcoming article.
The uncertainty underlying the government
shutdown and debt default is the object of a wave of speculative activity on
major markets.
Wall Street financial institutions not only
exert a decisive influence in the formulation of the Administrations fiscal
and monetary agenda, they also control the movement of currency markets,
commodity and stock markets through large scale operations in derivative
trade.
Most of the key actors in the US Congress and
the Senate involved in the shutdown debate are controlled by powerful
corporate lobby groups including, of course, Wall Street. The latter are
those which ultimately decide on the outcome.
They are not only in a
position to influence the results of the Congressional process, they also
have foreknowledge of the nature and timing of key decisions and they are in
a position to reap multibillion dollar speculative gains in the derivative
markets by speculating on policy outcomes of which they have advanced
knowledge.
Those who determine the governments debt
policy, namely the Wall Street creditors, also have "inside information" or
prior knowledge of the chronology and outcome of the government shutdown
impasse, will make billions of dollars in windfall profits
While Wall Street is instrumental in triggering
the debt ceiling impasse, major financial institutions will also be placing
their bets in large scale speculative transactions.
