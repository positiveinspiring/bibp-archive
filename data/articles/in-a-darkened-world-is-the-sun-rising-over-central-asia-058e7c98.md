President Nursultan
Nazarbayev
In the light of the political upheavals and mass rebellions taking place
almost everywhere in the world - in the north African and Near Eastern
Muslim states, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in Europe and America - all the
international talk at present is on the clash of global geopolitical forces
and how to resolve them.
Can we ever expect world peace to materialize
out of what amounts to a worldwide battlefield?
Some observers believe not. They contend that competitive and warlike
tensions are endemic to the geopolitical/economic level of the human
enterprise, and that the resolution of the present state of chronic
international conflict can come about only from above, from the
cultural/religious sphere.
Commenting on the great natural catastrophes of
2011, as well as the escalating rebel activities in north Africa, Wilhelm
Augustat, Austrian president of the European office of the
Peace Through Culture International,
said:
"It has once again become obvious that
solutions for problems of this size and type cannot be derived from the
technical and sociopolitical levels of our civilization, by excluding
the spiritual-cultural sphere of human life." 1
Those who hold to Augustats view and see the
building of a peaceful worldwide commonwealth of nations as a possibility
that must begin at the highest cultural and spiritual level, are turning
their attention to Kazakhstan in Central Asia, whose
new
capital, Astana, hosted the above-mentioned World Forum of Peace
through Spiritual Culture in October, 2010.
In Kazakhstan they glimpse something immensely
hopeful for the rest of the world taking place:
the rebirth of principles of civilization
once considered essential for peace and mutual understanding between
nations, but now long lost to the world, their very existence forgotten.
Central Asia ceased to be a part of the Soviet
Union in 1991, a large part of it becoming instead the independent nation of
Kazakhstan.
Now one of the largest countries in the world,
this vast new state spreads across the heart of the Eurasian landmass from
the shores of the Caspian sea to the Tien Shan mountains and the Altai,
uniting East to West. Crisscrossed by ancient trade routes and revealing to
archaeologists the ruins of long-buried civilizations, the whole region is
now striving to reconstitute its shattered identity as guardian of the
worlds oldest traditions of sacred knowledge.
Tiberio Graziahni, president of the Institute of Advanced Studies
in Geopolitics and Auxiliary Sciences, refers to the region that
traverses central Asia from the Gobi to the Mediterranean basin as "the
hinge of the whole Afro-Eurasian landmass" and as critical to its
integration - and to world peace.
Widely regarded as the crucible of civilization,
Central Asia is even more than that: it is the generative heart of the
planet, a place of evolutionary birthing that has become active again and
again throughout history, spawning religions, sciences and civilizations
that have fanned out across the world.
Here where the ancient Silk Road ran and
invading hordes and new religious movements swept to and fro remaking
civilizations, history reveals that the influence of a single powerful
spiritual source has been radiating out under various names, promoting peace
and righteousness to the ends of the Earth for countless millennia.
From the Karakorum mountains at the western end of the Trans-Himalayas this
same spiritual hierarchy gave birth to the Sun religion around five thousand
years ago.
It sent forth the Sons of the Sun or Sons of
Heaven, sometimes known as the Sons of Light, to build a network of temples
around the globe that brought knowledge both scientific and spiritual to the
people and civilization to the whole planet.
Supplanting Ice age
shamanism
and the earlier worship of the Pole star in the constellation Draco
for that
of the Sun, the new faith nevertheless
preserved a great deal of reverence for the lofty principles of its
predecessor, as indeed is testified by the totemic masks of birds, animals
and fish still worn by
the neter gods in ancient Egyptian art.
This mysterious hierarchy also lay behind the
Sun religion of the Shang dynasty in China and the Kibieri of the Celts, and
behind the Solar religion of the Egyptian kings of Heliopolis who, as Sons
of the Sun, were closely allied to the original Asiatic order.
Although still culturally devastated by the destructive materialism imposed
on them by communist Russia, Kazakhstans people preserve the memory of
their illustrious past and long for its return.
Travellers say that the whole of Central Asia
still rings with
stories of Shambhala, a place of
enlightenment and peace hidden among the most remote mountain valleys,
and once known also as the Land of the Living Gods, the Forbidden Land and
the Land of White Waters where the culture-bearing Sons of the Sun
originated.
Faced by the devastation of their ancient
culture, the hopes of many of the Central Asian peoples are still high that
soon this will be rectified; the king of Shambhala will lead his great band
of warriors out to destroy his enemies and reclaim the kingdom as his own,
as a Buddhist prophecy has long declared.
Legend foretold the day when Rigden Jyepo, the king of Shambhala,
would come with a great army to destroy the forces of evil and usher in a
golden age:
'the Age of Maitreya.'
Shambhala, therefore, symbolized the great
future, when the Panchen Lama would be reborn as Rigden Jyepo and
the reign of Maitreya, the 'Coming One',
would begin.2
Provocatively, however, the former Library Congress historian and Professor
Andrei Znamensky has a somewhat different and less spiritual take on
the prophesied Buddhist war of Shambhala. Obviously, he says in his book
Red Shambhala, the prophesy is actually directed against Islam and the
mlecca - the Mecca people - who have invaded the land.3
However that may be, today there are signs in
Kazakhstan of the birth of a Muslim reforming program that owes nothing to
the more combative Buddhist scenario, yet fulfils in every essential way the
Shambhala prophecy, promising to usher in a new era and a new sacred society
based on culturally enlightened principles.
The young oil- and gas-rich nation of Kazakhstan, whose geography takes in a
majestic panorama of seas, alpine forests, steppes, deserts and snowfields,
is home to something like 140 ethnic groups of every possible cultural
background and religious persuasion.
As well as the indigenous Kazakhs, here are
established Nestorian Christian and Sufi communities, indigenous Buddhist
groups and shamanic nomads still roaming the steppes, as well as a large
population of Jews who fled here after the Romans sacked Jerusalem in the
second century CE; besides which there are Jewish converts
known as Khazars who have migrated eastward and settled in their
thousands in this foreign land.
An ex-Communist with visionary ideals, the President of Kazakhstan
Nursultan Nazarbayev seems determined to democratize Islam, although not
perhaps in the western style.
Breaking the traditional Muslim mould of
power-driven dynastic autocracy that featured until very recently in all the
Muslim caliphates, he recently rejected a referendum that would give him a
further ten years in office, and showed readiness to actually shorten the
term of presidential office.
He has initiated the Peoples Assembly of
Kazakhstan, which gives every ethnic group the right to take part in the
decision-making congresses associated with the political, cultural and
social activities of the country.
And his attitude to women is also modern.
Schools for girls are a priority, with attention given to getting girls into
science and technology.
The main thrust of Nazarbayevs initiatives is clearly to bring into
international dialogue the various divisive issues that press most heavily
on the global community at present. Astana hosts a number of world
congresses, including the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies and a
World Conference on Disarmament, while the First Almaty Economic Business
Forum may be held in Astana in 2012.
But the Presidents chief initiative remains one
that first materialized in 1992, soon after Kazakhstans independence from
the Soviet Union.
In 2003 the Congress of the Leaders of World
and Traditional Religions was held with great success in Astana, and
again in 2006 and 2009. Emphasis was laid on the principles that bind
religions together rather than those that separate them.
In October 2010 the World Forum for Spiritual Culture, intended for a
more general interdisciplinary gathering, was held in Astana, again chaired
by the Kazakhstan President and imbued with the religious tolerance for
which the ancient shamanic races of this region, such as the Mongols and
also the Sufi orders, have long been famous.4
As the British scholar and philosopher Peter
Kingsley notes,
"It was no small practical achievement for
the Mongol Khans to transform into a major institution the long-standing
Central Asian custom of convening formal gatherings made up of
representatives from different religions so they could openly discuss
their beliefs on an equal footing instead of just killing each other."
5
According to the same open principle, high-level
representatives from about seventy-five countries, "from all cultures,
cults and worldviews," attended the historic gathering in Astana.
In his Conference report on the International
Forum for Peace through Culture, Augustat stated that the world
initiative launched by Kazakhstans President is based on non-violence,
harmony and cooperation between nations.
"The core problem of our present time is
formed of lethargy, extreme egoism, greed, corruption, purely
materialist thinking and so forth - all of which have to be exchanged
for real human values." 6
Similar world gatherings to those in Kazakhstan
are of course being held elsewhere, for example in Turkey and Australia very
recently.
But the key objective of the Executive
Committee of Spiritual Culture as proposed by President Nazarbayev
strikes another new and even more revolutionary note. It aims at nothing
less than the furtherance of an integration of science, socio-politics and
religion in one overarching transcendental order.
As Kingsley notes, from the very earliest times
but now long lost, this idea of a comprehensive divine whole uniting all
that exists was also a core principle of the philosophy of central Asian
shamanism from which the Sun religion directly emerged, and in which there
was a constant overlapping of,
"spirituality and science, mechanical
ingenuity and philosophy, mysticism and military expertise," 7
as well as poetry, gnosis and politics.
Consequently, one of the most important
highlights that came out of the Kazakhstan World Forum, notes Augustat, is
the awareness of the necessity of a synthesis of the political and
spiritual-cultural as well as scientific spheres in society, and the gradual
overcoming of their present entrenched separation.
This very postmodern approach, which even today
is entertained by only a minority of western thinkers as the necessary basis
for a more enlightened world civilization, characterizes the
Kazakhstan Executive and raises the interesting question:
The Sacred Union of
the East
As we shall shortly see, President Nazarbayevs is not the first attempt in
modern times to reestablish in the Eurasian heartland a nation based on
enlightened spiritual principles.
Seventy years before the birth of the Kazakhstan
nation a similar Buddhist attempt was essayed in the Altai in southern
Siberia.
Nazarbayevs has been guided, it would seem, by
a different star, a gnostic vision from a far more distant time; but
nevertheless, the earlier attempt to establish a Buddhist New Country of New
Russia in the Altai may well be seen as a rehearsal for Kazakhstans more
ambitious Muslim experiment.
After the 1917 Revolution in Russia, says Znamensky, Communism took on a
religious quality,
"typical of religious revitalization
movements in tribal societies." 8
In his book
Red Shambhala, he reveals the
underground occult agenda of a visionary Russian clique working within the
very core of the new Bolshevik State to bring about a political condition
impregnated with the Buddhist wisdom of Shambhala.
Inspired by Buddhist prophesies, this
clandestine group active within the Soviet Secret Police believed that the
social ideals of Communism were compatible with those foretold of the
Buddha Maitreya, the One to Come, and that with the amalgamation
of the two a glorious mystical era of Communism would result that would
benefit the whole world.
So persuasive was this vision that for a while
the movement gathered many Communist adherents, and indeed was to be
destroyed only by the later Stalinist purges. But not before a number of
expeditions were either planned or actually sent forth from Russia and
elsewhere in eastern Europe, with the intention of finding the fabled
kingdom and embracing its immortal teachings.
One of these expeditions - and the most celebrated - was launched from New
York by the painter Nicholas Roerich and his wife Helena, White
Russian émigrés to America and passionate converts to the new Theosophical
teachings promulgated by another Russian, Helena Blavatsky.
Nicholas established a Master art school in New
York and Helena, a mystical clairvoyant, channeled guidance from
Masters Morya and Koot Hoomi, the same Mahatmas whom
Blavatsky had claimed as her unseen Adepts and spiritual mentors
a few decades earlier. (According to recent research, these two Masters were
most probably Hindu and Sikh Indians, presumably high initiates in their
respective religions.) 9
The Roerichs were also strongly influenced by
the shamanic teachings and legends of Shambhala that had been trickling into
Russia from Russian expatriates in southern Siberia for the past hundred or
so years; and in 1923, at the behest of the Master Morya and under his
continual guidance, the Roerichs set out for central Asia on an arduous
odyssey to find the wondrous kingdom.
Behind the ostensible reason for the expedition was a hidden agenda of the
greatest import, which Master Morya impressed on them was the additional
meaning of the prophesy of Shambhala.
Shambhala, he said, was,
"not only the abode of mystical Buddhist
learning, it was the guiding principle of the coming cosmic age."
10
Its further meaning would unfold in the
establishment of a sacred New Country, a New Russia in the Altai, a
mountainous country in southern Siberia lying at the intersection of
Mongolia, Kazakhstan and Tibet.
There the Roerichs were to found the New Country
on the highest Buddhist principles. It was to be governed at a spiritual
level by the exiled Tibetan Panchen Lama - whom they were commissioned to
find somewhere in Mongolia and bring back to the Altai - and on an
administrative level by Nicholas himself, who sometimes wore the robes of
the Tibetan Dalai Lama.
According to Znamensky, the Roerichs envisaged in the Altai a utopian
theocracy composed of,
"a commonwealth of people who would live a
highly spiritual life and work as a cooperative - the economic
foundation of this new state." 11
In fact the New Country was to be nothing less
than a unification of all Inner Asian peoples into a spiritual kingdom. Thus
would be established the Sacred Union of the East.
The project failed. It was naïve, ill-conceived and geopolitically ignorant.
The Panchen lama, at that time enjoying a
profligate lifestyle in Mongolia, was not interested in the New Country. And
visiting Soviet Russia to elicit support for their Great Plan, the Roerichs
received only a cautious and limited response from the government while
antagonizing all the other great powers - Japan, America, Britain and China
- at that time mutually competing to gain access to the riches of central
Asia.
Nicholas and his son George made a further
attempt to materialize the Masters plans in 1937, but this attempt
too failed, and having earned the fury of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the then
president of the US who saw their endeavors as a betrayal of US interests,
the Roerichs were obliged to retire to India for the rest of their lives.
Nevertheless, we can glimpse in the Roerichs Altaic project a
foreshadowing, a rehearsal or preliminary model of what is presently
happening in neighboring Kazakhstan.
But there are significant differences.
For one thing, and an important one, in the
Buddhist venture Nicholas Roerich laid no discernible emphasis on
interdisciplinary unification, a reform of the utmost importance to
Kazakhstans President. Nor is there any indication that Nazarbayev draws to
any degree on the mythology of Shambhala.
Indeed the warlike outlook that lurks behind the
Altaic venture and plays such a large part in the Buddhist prophecies of
Shambhala - leading Nicholas and Helena to regard themselves as "Shambhala
warriors" - is entirely absent from Nazarbayevs idealistic program.
To trace the bond that does undoubtedly seem to
exist between these two regional ventures seventy years apart, we must delve
more deeply into the nature of the ancient spiritual hierarchy that lies at
an even more hidden level beneath Shambhalas folk mythology.
The Rising Sun in
Asian History
What then is the source of Kazakhstans unusual and potentially
revolutionary geopolitical objectives?
To find a precedent for them we have only to
turn back to the great days of the Sun religion that peaked during the third
millennium BCE.
As the Solar impulse spread globally into a honeycomb of separate national
cults, each with its own sacerdotal hierarchy, the priesthoods of low rank,
concerned mainly with ritual and dogma, separated out, everywhere dissolving
into polycentric and insular attitudes towards each other, very much in the
modern divisive manner.
But in the higher prophetic ranks we find a
counterbalancing trend of a quasi-clandestine nature that preserved the
original unicentric Solar policy, even to maintaining an overseeing
brotherhood with its headquarters remaining in Central Asia.
In this way, by preserving their cohesion the prophets contributed an
underlying unity and strength to society that universally balanced the
equally divisive tendencies of popular religion.
A hierarchic philosophy in the higher Solar
echelons balanced a democratic one in the lower, leading to a spirit of
accord and international harmony unprecedented to this day, yet at the same
time allowing ideological differences to flourish creatively in the lower
levels of the religion.
Furthermore, these higher-ranking adepts were men and women of learning as
well as spirituality; sages, but also astronomers, engineers, scientists,
doctors and architects, who combined the various secular disciplines at all
times with their metaphysical interests.
Even as the Earth and the stars of the firmament
were seen as related elements of one transcendental order, so that divine
Whole was believed to be inclusive of, and to bring into relationship all
areas of human knowledge, whether they be religious, psychosocial or
physical.
Two famous historical figures who fall into this
category are Visvakarma of the Arunachala temple in India, a renowned
expert in geometry and number, and Imhotep, ancient high priest of
Heliopolis in Egypt, an engineer and architect who famously built the step
pyramid at Saqqara.
By means of this policy of multidisciplinary
integration which brought together at all levels the opposite poles of human
knowledge, those of the spiritual and natural orders, societies were unified
at a high overall level, but without stifling the creative potential that
lies in the challenges of diversity and opposition.
Thus it was the operation of the two key principles of religious tolerance
and multidisciplinary unity maintained in a high state of ideological
tension that, while they lasted, rendered
the Sun religion the greatest civilizing
force the world has ever known.
But in time, as the initial impulse spread ever
more widely throughout the Old and the New Worlds and discord inevitably
increased, the religion increasingly found expression in various more
esoteric orders bearing different names but inherently the same liberal
principles.
One of these orders was the international Order
of Melchizedek, widely believed to be involved in the beginning of all three
Semitic religions, Judaism and Christianity as well as Islam.
Melchizedek, king of Righteousness, is a mysterious figure who
threads his way through the Hebrew Bible as high priest in perpetuity of the
Canaanite Sun God El-Elion. He is said within occult circles to head
a Righteousness Order whose secret headquarters, even to the present day,
preserve in the mountains of central Asia an organization of great antiquity
and influence in religious affairs with branches in many countries and
throughout many epochs.
Superior to any local cult or priesthood and
steeped in the wisdom of shamanic gnosis, the order claims to be, like the
Sun religion, an underground spiritual stream, itself invisible and
timeless, from which all our disparate belief systems ultimately stem.
In Genesis (14-18) Melchizedek initiates the prophet Abraham, the ancient
ancestor of all the Semitic tribes, into the Solar worship of God Most
High after Abraham had defeated a coalition of kings.
"And Melchizedek, king of Salem, caused
bread and wine to be brought; and he was priest of God Most High (El
Elion). And he blessed Abram, saying:
Blessed be Abram, he of God Most High,
possessor of Heaven and Earth; and blessed be God Most High who has
delivered your enemies into your hands.
And Abram gave him the tithe of all he had
taken."
As the esotericist René Guénon notes,
"the whole episode enacts a true
investiture, almost in the feudal sense of the word, but with the
difference that it is a spiritual investiture, wherein is found the
exact point of union between the Hebraic and the great primordial
tradition." 12
As a consequence of the rite Abram acquired the
new name of Abraham.
Andrew Welburn, a Fellow of New College, Oxford, suggests a
continuity throughout history of the rites of the Israelite kings and the
older Mystery practices connected with the ancestral king and high priest of
the Sun God El.13
Thus, Welburn says, since Judaism was primarily
a lunar religion, these Solar initiations would have been strictly esoteric
Mystery events.
The Letter to the Hebrews (5-6) in the New
Testament implies a similar distinction in Christianity, for the writer,
Apollonius of Alexandria, declares that Jesus Christ too has been given
the office of high priest of God Most High.
Here, says Welburn, we meet again the old
Canaanite priest-king Melchizedek, who was so central to Essene and Gnostic
teachings and whose name is linked to the hidden Solar symbolism that runs
through the lunar religion of Judaism.14
In the case of Islam, although Muhammads Arabic Qraiysh clan was the only
one to have abstained from polytheism and remain loyal
to El, the traditional High God of the
Arabs whom Muhammad called Allah,15 the connection
with the Melchizedek Order is not as direct as in Judaism and Christianity:
yet it is there.
Although nowhere stated in the Koran, not only
would Muhammad therefore have come automatically under the tutelage of Els
high priest Melchizedek, but also it is an Arabic tradition that Abraham, as
the first of Islams prophetic lineage passed the wisdom he had received
from Melchizedek down the line to the prophet Muhammad and his Islamic
reformation.
And there in Islam it was preserved by the
Sufis, a spiritual order that had existed long before Islam.
In The People of the Secret, the Sufi author Ernest Scott elaborates
the idea that Sufism, which he says originated in northern Afghanistan,
shares a common origin with other ancient religious forms.16
Like the Sons of the Sun and the
Righteousness adepts, the Sufis were direct heirs of neolithic shamanism
and more than any other religious system of the day carried forward the two
key principles of the Sun religion.
For a time Sufism became a powerful democratic
influence wherever Islam spread, constellating especially along the
Afro-Eurasian "hinge" referred to by Tiberio Grazianhi.
As a consequence, by the eleventh century CE the Sufis had welded Islam into
the greatest force for civilization at that time known. Active behind the
various national caliphates, they resurrected Greek knowledge at a time of
calamitous cultural decline in the West and extended to western powers
friendship and learning in equal measure.
For centuries the Sufis ensured that Jews,
Christians and Muslims lived at peace with each other, extending the
boundaries of knowledge and together rebuilding the cultural wealth that had
been lost after the demise of the Roman empire.
And Sufism also ensured that in the Fatimid
caliphate of the eleventh century a mosque became the first university in
Islam in which theological expertise united with that of chemistry,
astronomy and medicine, mathematics and geometry in an overall metaphysic of
great intellectual force.
There can be no doubt whatever that this underground Sufi input, even in a
time of greatest Muslim intolerance towards it, still operates clandestinely
along the Afro-Eurasian "hinge." But it is in Kazakhstan that it is arguably
causing what may well become a fully flowering Muslim cultural
renaissance of the highest order, a rising of the Sun of gnosis which
will affect the whole of Islam.
In President Nazarbayevs gatherings of eminent representatives of all
the religions on Earth, and in his
insistence on bringing together the various spiritual and scientific
disciplines in one comprehensive embrace, something quite unique may be
happening in Central Asia that will have important consequences for the
peace and harmony not only of Islam but of the rest of the world..
This is a time of critical challenges and
perhaps only time will tell.
