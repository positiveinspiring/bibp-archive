Following the publication of my article titled Gate
Rape of America, I was contacted by a source within the
DHS who is
troubled by the terminology and content of an internal memo reportedly
issued yesterday at the hand of DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano.
Indeed, both the terminology and content
contained in the document are troubling.
The dissemination of the document itself is
restricted by virtue of its classification, which prohibits any manner of
public release. While the document cannot be posted or published, the more
salient points are revealed here.
The memo, which actually takes the form of an 'administrative directive,'
appears to be the product of undated but recent high level meetings between
Napolitano, John Pistole, head of the Transportation Security
Administration (TSA),
and one or more of Obamas national security advisors.
This document officially addresses those who are
opposed to, or engaged in the disruption of the implementation of the
enhanced airport screening procedures as domestic extremists.
The introductory paragraph of the multi-page document states that it is
issued,
in response to the growing public backlash
against enhanced TSA security screening procedures and the agents
conducting the screening process.
Implicit within the same section is that the
recently enhanced security screening procedures implemented at U.S.
airports, and the measures to be taken in response to the negative public
backlash as detailed [in this directive], have the full support of the
President.
In other words,
Obama
not only endorses the enhanced security screening, but the
measures outlined in this directive to be taken in response to public
objections.
The terminology contained within the reported memo is indeed troubling. It
labels any person who interferes with TSA airport security screening
procedure protocol and operations by actively objecting to the established
screening process,
including but not limited to the
anticipated national opt-out day as a domestic extremist.
The label is then broadened to include,
any person, group or alternative media
source that actively objects to, causes others to object to, supports
and/or elicits support for anyone who engages in such travel disruptions
at U.S. airports in response to the enhanced security procedures.
For individuals who engaged in such activity at
screening points, it instructs TSA operations to obtain the identities of
those individuals and other applicable information and submit the same
electronically to the Homeland Environment Threat Analysis Division, the
Extremism and Radicalization branch of the Office of Intelligence &
Analysis (IA)
division of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
For any person, group or domestic alternative media source that actively
objects to, causes others to object to, supports and/or elicits support for
anyone who engages in such travel disruptions at U.S. airports (as defined
above) in response to the enhanced security procedures, the [applicable DHS
administrative branch] is instructed to identify and collect information
about the persons or entities, and submit such information in the manner
outlined [within this directive].
It would appear that the Department of Homeland Security is not only
prepared to enforce the enhanced security procedures at airports, but is
involved in gathering intelligence about those who dont.
Theyre making a list and most certainly will be
checking it twice.
Meanwhile, legitimate threats to our air travel
security (and they DO exist) seem to be taking a back seat to the larger
threat of the multitude of non-criminal American citizens who object to
having their Constitutional rights violated.
As I have
written before, it has nothing to do with
security and everything to do with control.
