The data being collected by
the NSA, FBI and DHS is being converted to
technological weapons against the American public. This surveillance will
undoubtedly be used as criminal evidence for trial.
The inception of NSA-GCHQ ECHELON system with the immensely profitable
Surveillance Industrial Complex has become a technologically advanced
interception system as journalist Nicky Hager predicted in 1996.
ECHELON was designed to extract massive amounts of data indiscriminately.
A
covert system of interception facilities were built to spy on the worlds
satellites, international telecommunication, and radio communications.
ECHELON was the link between all these and provided the US government with
high tech surveillance capabilities for its time.
Whether blanket spying or eavesdropping, the intelligence community could
sit back covertly and mine for data without detection.
According to James Bamford,
the Pentagon is attempting to expand its
worldwide communications network, known as the Global Information Grid, to
handle yottabytes (10 to the 24th bytes) of data. (A yottabyte is a
septillion bytesso large that no one has yet coined a term for the next
higher magnitude.)...
It needs that capacity because, according to a
recent report by Cisco, global Internet traffic will quadruple from 2010 to
2015... reaching 966 exabytes per year. (A million exabytes equal a
yottabyte.)
Thus, the NSAs need for a 1-million-square-foot data
storehouse. Should the agency ever fill the Utah center with a yottabyte of
information, it would be equal to about 500 quintillion
(500,000,000,000,000,000,000) pages of text.
William Binney, former NSA official and whistleblower, stated that,
Actually, I think the surveillance has increased. In fact, I would suggest
that theyve assembled on the order of 20 trillion transactions about U.S.
citizens with other U.S. citizens.
The TSA, it has been revealed has total control over jurisdiction over all
forms of mass transit.
Samuel Huntington spoke of the coming technological surveillance state where
he states that the Western global Elite have responded to the excess of
democracy with technological enhancements.
While austerity threatens to further enslave the masses with debt they do
not owe and
the Elite are investing in the corporatism that is bubbling to
the surface, a police state is manifesting under their illegitimate rule.
The attitude of government is to spy on its citizens without accountability
and restraint.
The US government has been hard at work shredding the US Constitution .
The UKs parliament has been passing anti-social restraints to force their
people into submission.
France, Spain and other EU countries are under direct rule of technocratic
bankers who were not elected, but placed into power.
Corporations like
Microsoft, Apple,
Google and
Facebook have given their
information over to the DHS and NSA while claiming they are not.
Local law enforcement has been working with cellular phone corporations to
survey Americans without cause or warrant.
These are the calling cards of a police state even Orwell could not have
imagined.
And we are experiencing this reality now... with no end in sight.
