Late guardian of French
branch of banking dynasty
had a web of at least 20
secrecy-cloaked trusts
in the South Pacific.
Baron Elie de Rothschild, the
guardian of the French branch of the famed Rothschild banking
dynasty, built an offshore empire in the palm-fringed Cook
Islands between 1996 and 2003.
Rothschild, a businessman and arts
patron who died in 2007 at the age of 90, constructed a complex
network of offshore trusts and front companies, according to
secret documents obtained by the International Consortium of
Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)
and reviewed by Le Monde.

The complex nature of the financial
arrangements in the Pacific islands and their near-total secrecy
made it difficult to identify his hand in the offshore
entities.
The internal documents reveal at
least 20 trusts and 10 holding companies were set up for
Rothschild in the Cook Islands, an independent territory in the
South Pacific with close ties to New Zealand.
The trusts have typically opaque
names,
Anon Trust, followed by
the Benon Trust (apparently set up by Rothschilds daughter
Nelly) and Denon Trust, being notable examples.
All of them are linked in a
multi-layered, complicated web. Each of the companies is listed
as trustee of one or more of the trusts.
None of the documents that ICIJ or
Le Monde examined lists the beneficiary of any of the
trusts, although all but Benon
list Rothschild as the settlor,
the individual whose assets are put into a trust.
These documents also reveal that
several of these trusts
continued after the Barons death in 2007. The companies
have a common shareholder called
Mandalor Limited, an equally opaque company based in the
Caribbean country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
According to a document, when
Portcullis TrustNet set up Agate, Begate, Cegate, Degate, Egate
and Fegate Trusts, the appointed lawyer was
not willing to disclose Rothschilds identity.
Although PTN normally required the
grantor to provide their full personal details and a deed of
indemnity, in this instance PTN arranged for the lawyer to sign
for and on behalf of the grantor.
The lawyer informed PTN the grantor
is the head of a wealthy and respected European family whom he
had known for several years.
PTN conceded,
stating,
In
this respect, we must rely entirely on your assurances.
Despite repeated attempts, Le
Monde was unable to speak to Rothschilds heirs.
Only Baron Eric de Rothschild, Elies nephew and a prominent Paris banker,
agreed to answer questions, making it clear that their paths had
separated in the 1980s when Elie de Rothschild moved to London.
Another source close to the family
said Elie de Rothschild developed business activities in Great
Britain and the United States in which no other member of the
French branch invested.
