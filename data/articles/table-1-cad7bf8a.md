More Developed Regions: Europe, North America, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Temperate South America. Less Developed Regions: All other regions * The seeming inconsistency in growth trends between the UN medium and the US-proposed projection variants
for East Asia is due to a lack of reliable information on China's total population, its age structure, and
the achievements of the country's birth control program.
