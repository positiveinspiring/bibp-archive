While Big pharmaceutical companies stand to win
under
Obamacare, this only holds true if the economy improves and local
Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) allow brand prescription drugs to
remain on formulary (a formulary is an approved list of medications that
physicians can prescribe for their patients under a given insurance/managed
care plan).
The average physician, however, loses big under any scenario due to bundled
services and decreased, capitated reimbursement.
Meanwhile, local physician board members and
medical society leaders stand to profit off of their colleagues' misery as
they position themselves at the center of ACO 'medical homes'.
The Drug Company
Perspective
The pharmaceutical industry recently expressed outrage over an Obamacare/Government
practice known as "academic detailing" (or "counter-detailing") wherein
government-contracted nurses and pharmacists will meet with doctors to offer
the government's point of view on expensive pharmaceutical treatments.
Big Pharma is concerned that legislation
must address the issue of neutrality and fairness since (unlike their own
corporate 'drug reps') the government detailers will not be regulated to
insure the accuracy of their information.
In 2009, Senator Kohl introduced The
Independent Drug Education and Outreach Act to put limits on what
detailing programs can receive grant money and what educational materials
can be disseminated by these federally-promoted detailers.
This legislation never advanced to law. The idea
is that the same rules that govern accuracy and other such activity for the
pharmaceutical industry should be universally applied to government
detailers as well.
Big Pharma signed on to Obamacare back in 2009 after numerous meetings,
including some White House secret deals that involved the President and the
CEOs of major drug companies. After legislators passed the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) legislation, however, many in
the pharmaceutical industry began to express concern that they had made a
bad decision.
After all, if Obamacare were to derail the
economy, and local 'mini-HMOs' called ACOs took hold, there would be less
money for new, expensive (and often superior) brand medications as more
emphasis would be placed on generic medicines.
The drug industry is now counting on the influx
of tens of millions of additional prescription recipients to offset any
potential losses incurred in the push for a more 'nationalized'/socialized
medical drug delivery system (i.e., one that would push cheaper generics
over brand name drugs).
In 2010, nearly 4 million people with Medicare who reached the program's
'Part D' coverage gap
received a one-time, tax-free rebate check
for $250.
This political gesture caused a net $1 billion increase in Medicare
expenditures; this also contributed to the declines in personal
out-of-pocket (and private health insurance) prescription drug spending
because of the infusion of 'free' taxpayer money into the system.
All of this played well with the statistics
offered to the public to show that Obamacare was indeed a cost-cutter,
because one only had to look to see that patients were paying less for their
drugs overall. Of course, this was a shell game, but it played well on some
left-leaning media venues.
Healthcare reform reduced Medicaid spending too because Medicaid and the
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) grew by only 0.7% in 2010
compared with 6.8% in 2009. Again, be careful not to fall for the political
gamesmanship here, because the PPACA increased the Medicaid unit rebate
amount and extended rebates to Medicaid managed care plans.
Thus, federal expenditures on Medicaid grew by
2.5%
Overall, assuming a healthy economy and fair access to brand drugs at the
level of local ACOs, drug companies will win under Obamacare because the new
health care law will boost drug spending. CMS projects that annual drug
expenditures will double in the next 10 years, to $512.6 billion by 2020.
And, compliments of the PPACA, retail drug spending is projected to grow
$35.2 billion (+7.3%) higher in 2020 than it would have been
without healthcare reform.
The Community
Physician Perspective
Some may describe the Obamacare-Medicare Advantage financial scheme as a
complex game pitting a select few doctor leaders and hospital/health system
administrators against their physician colleagues.
Sometimes called 'coding for dollars', Medicare
payment schedules and Medical Advantage contracts with physicians
can be very complicated and confusing.
The following piece is a good summary of the Medicare Advantage money
stream:
CMS Unveils 2012 Medicare Advantage Payment Proposal.
It says, essentially, that,
"The national per capita Medicare Advantage
health plan 'growth Percentage' change, or cost trend, will be just
0.7%, but that quality rating bonuses should increase the average actual
Medicare Advantage per-capita payment by 1.6%."
Here is Medicare's April 2011 Medicare
Advantage report that determines rates for 2012.
Basically, community-based 'mini-HMOs' called ACOs or Accountable Care
Organizations will survive by managing sick patients in a comprehensive
fashion.
This will entail having an ethics panel review
which patients can have certain surgeries, and have certain plan managers
decide if payments to providers should be withheld for 'inadequate' or
'poor' care; it will also involve deciding how much certain specialty
doctors will be paid compared to others in an attempt to save the federal
government money (compared to historical, actuarial data).
If the local ACO/'medical home' is effective at
saving money for a given patient/disease state, it will receive bonuses from
Uncle Sam; if not, it will get less money.
Monthly capitated rates for Medicare Advantage plans are set by the feds in
April the year before, and are based on the local FFS (Fee For Service)
Medicare fee schedule.
HMOs/IPAs/ACOs may earn more money (i.e.,
'double down') by having a higher Risk Adjustment Formula (RAF)
number.
This number depends on ICD codes and other
factors like age. (e.g., 90 year olds are more frail than 70 year olds, and
diabetic patients with dementia cost more to take care of than non-diabetic,
non-demented patients, etc.).
The Physician vs. ACO
Battle
In the short run, physicians are set for further decreases in Medicare
reimbursement.
The SGR (Sustainable Growth Rate) formula for
paying doctors for Medicare services is set for a 27.4% cut in 6 weeks if
Congress cannot come up with either a semi-permanent 'fix' or, as they have
done for years, simply apply another 2-6 month deferment on the rate
decreases.
Despite the often misquoted 'rewards' for
physicians for the utilization of certain performance criteria,
e-prescriptions and the like, doctors will face progressive cuts in Medicare
pay (on top of the SGR cuts) starting in 2014 and beyond if they do not
comply with every onerous layer of new government mandates in practice
guidelines.
Thus, many doctors will not be able to sustain their current level of
patient care in the near future.
According to the Investor Business Daily poll of
September 2009, and several polls by other sources since, upwards of 45% of
physicians may stop seeing Medicare patients altogether or simply retire
early.
Herein lies the rub for community doctors:
Medicare Advantage plans like Secure
Horizons may get more money every year for the near future (in contrast
to decreasing doctors' pay), but not actually pass these increased
revenues along to physicians participating in IPA/ACO/'medical homes'.
Remember:
SGR cuts are only for Fee For Service (FFS)
dollars paid to physicians, not for Medicare Advantage (MA) dollars paid
to health systems.
If FFS cuts go through, MA plans like Secure
Horizons may still receive, for example, $400/month per capitated patient
life (plus additional dollars for creative coding for various severe disease
states) but then turn around and pay physicians 30% less based on the new
fee-for-service/SGR formula.
Until the Medicare Advantage plan dollars are themselves cut in the future,
the plans and individuals at the center of the ACO/medical home power
structure could be pocketing the difference - potentially millions of
dollars essentially picked from the pockets of community doctors.
The profits for local and state medical society
leaders who may be involved in such schemes could be multiple times what
they would earn actually taking care of patients.
Hospital/Health
Systems Commit Fraud to Garner Increased Federal Monies
In some cases, hospital systems - not unlike the core of the newly forming,
Obamacare-mandated, ACO cost-cutting units - will game the 'coding for
dollars' scheme to fraudulently capture more money from a shrinking national
pie of health care funds.
In the context of struggling community doctors,
who will be facing decreasing slices of this pie, this is particularly
disturbing. The added funds could be used to pad the pockets of the ACO/health
system leaders.
Case in point:
http://californiawatch.org/health-and-welfare/prime-hospital-bills-malnutrition-patient-says-she-wasn-t-treated-14055
Here, a,
"hospital's reimbursement
from Medicare increased by more than $6,700 [per patient under their
care] - from $4,708 to $11,463 - by noting kwashiorkor [a rare,
third-world country malnutrition problem] on the [patient's] bill,
according to a California Watch analysis of billing information obtained
under the federal Freedom of Information Act."
This fraud was widespread and committed over
1,000 times in one year at just one location.
Conclusion
In the end, in typical big government fashion, the health reform movement
made a crucial mistake in placing the power of cost-cutting measures in the
hands of those who are not actually delivering direct patient care.
Big Pharma made deals with the creators of
Obamacare, and these deals may or may not end up being successful for the
drug companies themselves.
Most notably, consumers could end up losing
because if needed new drugs cannot come to market due to restricted brand
drug availability in local ACO formularies, resulting in decreased revenues
and decreased research and development, then future breakthroughs and
patient care innovations may never come to fruition.
Likewise, ACOs will be creating hundreds of community-based managed care
power brokers, who will pit a select few potential profiteers (individuals
and health systems) against the broader group of medical providers in a
local area. If the doctors at the bedside and office setting cannot make
ends meet and thus restrict services/access and/or close up shop altogether,
the community as a whole will suffer.
The better way to implement health care reform would have been to do what
both Hillary-care and Obama-care both failed to do:
empower doctors themselves to create new
ways to increase access and decrease costs and waste.
Since the American Medical Association
represents only a minority of community physician members, and has existing
conflicts of interest due to tens of millions of dollars annually in
federal-protected copyrights on medical billing codes, they were not an
honest broker in the 'Act's' creation.
The real danger moving forward with the implementation of Obamacare is that
the law could be ruled unconstitutional and repealed, and yet local
Accountable Care Organizations could live on.
This may very well increase costs and waste by
allowing middlemen to control, profit and manipulate community medical care
for self-serving - not community-serving - purposes.
