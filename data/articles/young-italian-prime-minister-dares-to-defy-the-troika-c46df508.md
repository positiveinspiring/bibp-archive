# Young Italian Prime Minister Dares to Defy the Troika

Matteo
Renzi
It's not easy being a national leader of
a Eurozone country.
What with all the unpopular new laws and
legislation emanating from Brussels and Frankfurt and the financial
markets poised on a knife edge, the pressure can sometimes be
unbearable. Even a small misstep could have disastrous consequences.
For any national leader who wishes to
cling to his or her job, there are four basic rules of survival:
-
Always be nice to German
Chancellor Angela Merkel.
-
Never call - or even threaten to
call - a national referendum on any issue.
-
Never criticize or call into
question the actions of the Troika, or any of its three
constituent members,
-
The European Commission
-
ECB
(European Central Bank)
-
IMF (International
Monetary Fund)
-
Never mention - or even
entertain - the idea of exiting the Euro.
But today the Italian Prime Minister
Matteo Renzi veered dangerously off-message: he broke rule number
three.
But wasn't the first national leader to have broken the
rules.
The Price of Transgression
The first offender was then Greek Prime
Minister George Papandreou, who, in Oct. 2012, broke rule number two
when he announced his government's intentions to hold a referendum
on the terms of a new Eurozone bailout deal. Within two weeks
Papandreou was replaced by former Greek central banker and ex-Goldmanite
Lucas Papademos.
To make matters worse,
news surfaced that his mother owned a Swiss bank account with
550 million of undeclared funds. A painful price for a moment of
courage.
The second offender was Italy's then
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in September 2012. He'd dared to
discuss in private meetings with Eurozone leaders, presumably Merkel
and France's Nicolas Sarkozy, Italy's withdrawal from the Eurozone.
By December, Berlusconi was out, replaced by technocrat
Mario Monti,
a former central banker, European Commissioner, and ex-Goldmanite.
The message to other national leaders
was clear:
"don't even think about jeopardizing 'The Project'."
Since
then, discipline was restored in the ranks, and no political leader
dared cross either of the four lines.
Not until today when Italian
Prime Minister Matteo Renzi chose the occasion of an
interview with the Financial Times to veer dangerously
off-message and willfully break rule number three:
Never criticize or call into question
the actions of the Troika, or any of its three constituent members.
Making Dangerous Enemies
The target of Renzi's criticism was ECB
Chairman Mario Draghi, arguably the most untouchable of the Troika's
representatives (and Goldman Sachs' senior representative in
Europe).
Renzi's out-of-turn talk was the latest
escalation in a war of words that broke out with Draghi's
insinuation (read: threat) that Italy, after falling back into
recession, had not done enough to reform its labor market,
bureaucracy, or judicial system.
The result, he said, is an,
"unfavorable climate for investment."
In other words, what Italy
needs is a short, sharp dose of Troika-administered internal
devaluation - an intervention that merely serves to accelerate a
country's debt spiral while enriching well-connected international
investors.
Renzi seems to have other ideas.
"Our
model is not Spain, but Germany," he told the FT.
He came to office in February promising
to pull Italy out of a slump that has lasted more than a decade.
Progress has been slow, however, and his signature achievement to
date remains a tax break of 80 a month for low earners. It is hoped
that the next few months will see the passage into legislation of
far-reaching judicial reform, but there are no guarantees.
And with little to show in terms of
fiscal or labor reform, business leaders are getting tetchy, the FT
reports:
Italy's business leaders, desperate
for reform, have been big supporters of Mr Renzi, noting his
energy and determination. But they have voiced fears that he is
a micromanager who relies too much on a few trusted friends when
he needs experienced advisers to match his political ability.
The IMF Mole
One such "experienced advisor" is
Italy's Independent Spending Review Tsar, Carlo Cottarelli, who
spent most of his working life at the IMF.
In his last role he
served as the director of the Fund's Fiscal Affairs Department - perfect preparation, one assumes, for his current position in charge
of Italy's public spending.
However, Cottarelli is meeting
resistance, primarily from Renzi who intends to take control of the
spending cuts himself.
"It's Renzi who's going to decide where we
are making cuts
not a technocrat," Renzi told the FT in the third
person form.
Renzi also threatened to take on Italy's
business lobbies:
Rome is a city full of lobbyists.
Italy is used to relationship capitalism.
I'm not part of that
system that has destroyed this country. I'm alone with the 40
per cent of the Italians who voted for me, with the 11 million
Italians who voted for my party, and only with these and with my
team, will this country change.
This is not the first time that Renzi
has unleashed a shot across the Troika's bow.
In July, he declared
that the Troika would never come to Italy and that he would not
raise taxes.
Renzi's public defiance may be born of
principle, arrogance, or naivety, or a combination thereof; worse
still, it may be a carefully crafted sound bite for public
consumption.
Alternatively, it could be the product of a very astute
calculation: namely that he actually holds a much stronger position
than many believe.
As the EU's third largest economy, Italy's weak
economic performance is as much, if not more, of a headache for
Brussels as it is for Rome. With over 2 trillion of public debt - representing 133% of its GDP
- Italy is not only too big to fail,
it's too big to save.
What's more, deposing Renzi may prove
much more difficult than getting rid of Berlusconi.
After all, even
for a country boasting a modern political history like Italy's, four
unelected leaders in two years is probably a little excessive;
people might actually start wondering what happened to their
democracy.
If the Troika were to pull off another
bloodless coup, it would almost certainly have to be followed by
national elections.
And the main beneficiaries of those elections
would likely be Berlusconi's PdL Party and Beppe Grillo's Five Star
Movement - two parties that would like nothing more than to write
the epilogue in the Euro's short history.
So the Troika may be forced to put its
plans for Italy on ice - at least for now!
And as the plotters of
coups retire to the drawing board, Italy's debt continues to grow
while its economy slowly shrinks.
In the meantime its brave (or
perhaps just crazy) young leader wants a thousand days to make the
political and economic changes he thinks his country needs; he'll be
lucky if he gets a hundred.
