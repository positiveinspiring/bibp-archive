Prospects for the U.S. Congress launching inquiries into abuses by
the
Bush-Cheney administration have grown with a claim that Vice
President Dick Cheney ran an assassination unit out of the Joint
Special Operations Command (JSOC).

Speaking at a conference at the University of
Minnesota on March 10, respected journalist Seymour Hersh said that
the JSOC unit, comprising special military forces personnel, reported
directly to Cheney and operated without any kind of Congressional oversight.
According to Hersh, even the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of
Defense were out of the loop on JSOC operations.
In comments that set Washington abuzz, Hersh
concluded:
"Its an executive assassination ring
essentially, and its been going on and on and on.
Hershs claims led to Congressman Dennis
Kucinich on March 13 asking the Chair of a key House Committee to launch
an investigation. Hersh's claims are also likely to boost efforts by Senator
Patrick Leahy to create a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate
wrongdoing during the Bush-Cheney administration.
In 1976, President Ford issued Executive Order 11905 to clarify intelligence
activities. Among the "Restrictions on Intelligence Activities," contained
in the EO was a section entitled "Prohibition on Assassination."
Section 5(b) states:
"No employee of the United States Government
shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, political assassination."
Curiously, at the time Ford issued his EO, Dick
Cheney was his Chief of Staff. In 1981, President Reagan reiterated the
proscription against political assassination with Executive Order 12333. No
legislative act or executive order has since been issued to override
Reagans EO 12333 which remains in effect.
Congressman Kucinich has called for the House Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform to inquire into Cheney's alleged assassination unit.
In a letter to the Committee Chairman, Edolphus
Towns, Kucinich wrote:
"If substantiated, the allegation would have
far reaching implications for the United States. Such an assertion from
someone of Hershs credibility that has a long and proven track record
of dependability on these issues merits attention. Mr. Hersh is within a
year or more of releasing a book that is said to include evidence of
this allegation.
However, we cannot wait a year or more to
establish the truth. As such, I request that the Full Committee
immediately begin an investigation to determine the facts in this
matter."
If Vice President Cheney did authorize political
assassinations using a special operations unit that reported only to him,
then according to Kucinich in his letter, Cheney violated EO 12333.
Hershs claims also represent the kind of executive override of law
contained in a petition launched by the office of Senator Patrick Leahy to
establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Launched soon after Leahy
first proposed his Truth Commission on February 9, 2009 at Georgetown
University, the petition currently has over 85,000 signatures.
It seeks the investigation of abuses that,
include the use of torture, warrantless
wiretapping, extraordinary rendition, and executive override of laws.
If the Senate Judiciary committee or the House
Judiciary Committee decide to launch a Truth Commission, the mandate in
Leahys petition would give it the power to investigate Cheneys alleged
assassination unit.
Kucinich has been unsuccessful in gathering sufficient Congressional support
for impeachment charges against President Bush and Vice President Cheney.
This time he may gain more support if a reply
from Towns is any indication:
"Mr. Kucinich raised a serious issue and I
will work with him to look into it."
Despite Towns positive response, Kucinich does
not have the same status as Patrick Leahy in persuading democratic
colleagues to support his proposed investigation. Leahy heads the Senate
Judiciary Committee which makes it more likely that his Truth Commission
proposal will gather support as indicated in the March 3 Hearing he convened
where a number of Senate colleagues and witnesses spoke in favor.
A Truth and Reconciliation Commission with a broad mandate to
investigate executive override of laws could unveil many possible abuses
committed during the Bush-Cheney administration. in addition to the
existence of an assassination unit, possible abuses include politicizing the
Justice Department, the use of torture, and the firing of whistleblowers
willing to testify about abuses they witnessed.
Also, a Truth Commission can address other even
more controversial claims of executive override of laws such as unanswered
questions over events on 9/11, and the suppression of information concerning
UFOs and extraterrestrial life.
Hersh's claims about a Cheney-led assassination
unit, if accurate, may prove to be the tipping point in the effort to
establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and other Congressional
inquiries into
executive abuses by the Bush-Cheney administration.
