Arizona Sheriff: Obama Birth Certificate Forged
Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., said today that he and his
investigators have evidence that President Obama's birth certificate is a
forgery.
He also raised questions about the authenticity of
Obama's
selective service registration, though critics quickly accused him of
pandering for votes.
"We believe probable cause exists indicating that forgery and fraud may have
been committed, not only in President Obama's long-form birth certificate,
but more disturbing evidence suggests that another fraud may have been
committed regarding his selected service registration card," Arpaio, 79,
said at a press conference.
"Based on all of the evidence presented and
investigated I cannot in good faith report to you that these documents are
authentic."
The findings come after a six month investigation by Arpaio's
Cold Case
Posse, a group of volunteers, many of whom have backgrounds in law
enforcement.
"My investigators believe that the long-form birth certificate was
manufactured electronically and that it did not originate in a paper format
as claimed by the White House," Arpaio said.
Arpaio's investigators said the issue they are most concerned with is that
the,
"date stamp and registrar's stamp appear to have been imported from
unknown outside sources."

Arpaio said he decided to undertake the investigation last August after
members of the Tea Party asked him to do so.
However, some critics say the
tough-talking Arizona sheriff is using it as a way to distract from his own
legal problems as he seeks a sixth term in office.
"You say I need this to get elected? Are you
kidding me? I've been elected
five times. I don't need this," he was quoted by The Associated Press as
saying in response.
Arpaio faces a federal grand jury investigation on criminal abuse-of-power
allegations; the Justice Department has accused him of racial profiling
Latinos. And there has been an accusation that hundreds of sex-crime cases
were inadequately investigated by his department.
Obama's birth certificate has been called into question many times during
his political career and last April the White House released copies of it in
an attempt to quiet conspiracy theorists after Dondald Trump questioned
whether the president was born in the U.S. as the Constitution requires.

In response to Arpaio's press conference today, Ben LaBolt, press secretary
for the Obama campaign, tweeted a link to watch the live feed of Arpaio's
announcement. The link actually led to the theme song from "The X-Files," a
TV show that played heavily on conspiracy theories.
Coincidentally, Arpaio's press conference also came on the same day Obama's
campaign unveiled its new Facebook timeline.

First-Ever Law-Enforcement Investigation Concludes...
Obama Birth Certificate "Computer Generated Forgery"
March 1, 2012

WND Website
"President Barack Obama's long-form birth certificate released by the White
House on April 27, 2011, is suspected to be a computer-generated forgery,
not a scan of an original 1961 paper document as represented by the White
House when the long-form birth certificate was made public," Arizona's
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said at a press conference today in
Phoenix.
This is the major preliminary finding of a six-month ongoing Sheriff's
Cold
Case Posse law enforcement investigation into the authenticity of Obama's
birth certificate and his eligibility to be president.
Having developed probable cause to believe the long-form birth certificate
was most likely a computer-generated forgery, investigators began examining
other evidence of President Obama's life history.
Investigators additionally have developed credible evidence suggesting:
-
President Obama's Selective Service card
was most likely a forgery, revealed by an examination of the postal
date stamp on the document
-
Records of Immigration and Naturalization Service cards filled out by
airplane passengers arriving on international flights originating outside
the United States in the month of August 1961, examined at the National
Archives in Washington, D.C., are missing records for the week of President
Obama's birth, including the dates Aug. 1, 1961 through Aug. 7, 1961
Beginning in October 2011, the Sheriff's Cold Case Posse, consisting of
former law enforcement officers and lawyers with law enforcement experience,
examined dozens of witnesses and hundreds of documents, as well as taking
numerous sworn statements from witnesses around the world.
In August 2011, 250 members of the Surprise, Arizona, Tea Party, residents
of Maricopa County, presented a signed petition asking Sheriff Arpaio to
undertake the investigation.
The Tea Party members petitioned under the premise that if a forged birth
certificate was utilized to obtain a position for Barack Obama on the 2012
Arizona presidential ballot, their rights as Maricopa County voters could be
compromised.
The Cold Case investigators further determined that the Hawaii Department of
Health has engaged in what Sheriff's investigators believe is a systematic
effort to hide from public inspection whatever original 1961 birth records
the Hawaii Department of Health may have in their possession.
"Officers of the Hawaii Department of Health and various elected Hawaiian
public officials may have intentionally obscured 1961 birth records and
procedures, to avoid having to release to public inspection and to the
examination of court-authorized forensic examiners any original Obama 1961
birth records the Hawaii Department of Health may or may not have," said
Mike Zullo, the lead investigator in Sheriff Arpaio's Cold Case Posse.
The Cold Case investigators have not yet determined who, when, or precisely
how the long-form computer-generated birth certificate released on April 27
may have been forged, but investigators say the evidence contained in the
computer-generated PDF file released by the White House as well as important
deficiencies in the Hawaii process of certifying the long-form birth
certificate establish probable cause that a forgery has been committed.
The Cold Case Posse investigators advised Sheriff Arpaio that the forgers
most likely committed two crimes:
-
first, in fraudulently creating a forgery
that the White House characterized, knowingly or unknowingly, as an
officially produced governmental birth record
-
second, in fraudulently
presenting to the residents of Maricopa County and to the American public at
large a forgery the White House represented as "proof positive" of President
Obama's authentic 1961 Hawaii long-form birth certificate.
"A continuing investigation is needed to identify the identity of the person
or persons involved in creating the alleged birth certificate forgery, and
to determine who, if anyone, in the White House or the state of Hawaii may
have authorized the forgery," Arpaio said.
Among the evidence released at the press conference were five videos the
Cold Case Posse produced to demonstrate why the Obama long-form birth
certificate is suspected to be a computer-generated forgery.
The videos consisted of step-by-step computer demonstrations using a control
document.
The videos were designed to display the testing used by the investigators to
examine various claims made by supporters of the April 27 document.
The videos illustrate point-by-point the investigators' conclusion that the
features and anomalies observed on the Obama long-form birth certificate
were inconsistent with features produced when a paper document is scanned,
even if the scan of the paper document had been enhanced by Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) and optimized.
Additionally, the videos demonstrated that the Hawaii Department of Health
Registrar's name stamp and the Registrar's date stamp were
computer-generated images imported into an electronic document, as opposed
to actual rubber stamp imprints inked by hand or machine onto a paper
document.
"That we were able to cast reasonable suspicions on the authenticity of the
Registrar stamps was especially disturbing, since these stamp imprints are
designed to provide government authentication to the document itself," Zullo
said, stressing that if the Registrar stamps are forgeries, the document
itself is likely a forgery.
The investigators also chronicled a series of inconsistent and misleading
representations that various Hawaii government officials have made over the
past five years regarding what, if any, original birth records are held by
the Hawaii Department of Health.
"As I said at the beginning of the investigation," Arpaio said, "the
president can put all this to rest quite easily. All he has to do is demand
the Hawaii Department of Health release to the American public and to a
panel of certified court-authorized forensic examiners all original 1961
paper, microfilm, and computer birth records the Hawaii Department of Health
has in its possession."
Arpaio further stressed the Hawaii Department of Health needs to provide, as
part of the full disclosure, evidence regarding the chain of custody of all
Obama birth records, including paper, microfilm, and electronic records, in
order to eliminate the possibility that a forger or forgers may have
tampered with the birth records.
Arpaio went on to say the President should also authorize Kapiolani
Hospital, the birth hospital listed on the Obama long-form birth
certificate, to release any and all hospital patient records for Stanley Ann
Dunham Obama, his mother, and for the newly born Barack Obama, in order to
provide additional corroboration for the original 1961 birth records held in
the Hawaii Department of Health vault.
"Absent the authentic Hawaii Department of Health 1961 birth records for
Barack Obama, there is no other credible proof supporting the idea or belief
that President Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, as he and the White House
have consistently asserted," Zullo said.
"In fact, absent the authentication of Hawaii Department of Health 1961
birth records for Barack Obama, there is no other proof he was born anywhere
within the United States."
Arpaio concluded the press conference by suggesting a congressional
investigation might be warranted and asked that any other law enforcement
agency with information referencing this investigation be forwarded to his
office.
