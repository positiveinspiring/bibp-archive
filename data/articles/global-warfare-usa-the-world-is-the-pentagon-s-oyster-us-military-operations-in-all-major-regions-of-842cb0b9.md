Afghanistan
Any day now Washington may announce plans to add 40,000 or more troops to
the 68,000 already there. [2] Plans are underway to accommodate that influx.
The American military compound at and fanning out from the Bagram Air Field
has been expanded from 3,993 to 5,198 acres since 2001 and is in the process
of further enlargement. It already hosts some 25,000 U.S. troops and
contractors and,
"a new parking ramp supporting the world's largest aircraft
is to be completed this spring....[I]t is continuing to grow to keep up with
the requirements of an escalating war and troop increases." [3]
Regarding non-military personnel at Bagram and elsewhere in the nation,
"Contractors in Afghanistan outnumber U.S. troops there" [4]
as they do in
Iraq.
The Army Times recently reported on the main purpose of the airbase at
Bagram. Last month the number of U.S. and NATO air strikes in Afghanistan
was the highest since July of 2008, with 647 bombs dropped in October
compared to 752 a year ago July.
"The airstrike numbers dont include
strafing runs, attacks by special operations AC-130 gunships, launches of
small missiles or helicopter attacks." [5]
Africa
A U.S. Defense Department news source reported on November 5 that Air Forces
Africa commanders visited Mali and Senegal in West Africa. Vice commander
Michael Callan,
"visited Mali's 33d Parachute Regiment, a unit that carries
out operations using tactical vehicles and communication equipment provided
by the U.S. Defense and State Departments."
The Malian military is involved
in a counterinsurgency war in the nation's north aided by Washington.
A commander of Mali's armed forces said,
"Ninety-five percent of our
soldiers were trained by the U.S, and we've engaged with you in exercises
like Flintlock, Joint Planning and Assessment Teams and special bilateral
training." [6]
Flintlock military exercises have been held in different
locations on the African continent for years, this year's being conducted by
the new Africa Command (AFRICOM) for the first time. The U.S. also recently
led multinational military exercises in Gabon and Uganda on both ends of the
continent. [7]
The USS San Juan, "a fast-attack submarine," arrived in South Africa on
November 4,
"setting the stage for a series of first-ever, at-sea
engagements with the South African Navy submarine force." [8]
Armenia
Robert Simmons [9], NATO's special representative to the South Caucasus and
Central Asia - former Senior Adviser to the United States Assistant
Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs on NATO - was in this
South Caucasus nation earlier this month and announced that he had recruited
an initial contingent of Armenian troops for the war in Afghanistan.
This
marks the first deployment to that nation of soldiers from the Russian-led
seven-nation Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a potential
counterbalance to NATO in post-Soviet space.
"Simmons expressed NATO's 'appreciation to Armenia for its strong
contributions' to alliance missions, which he said began in Kosovo and will
now be repeated in Afghanistan." [10]
In reference to his mission of pulling yet another Russian ally into the
U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization orbit, Simmons said,
"We are
continuing cooperation with the Armenian Defense Ministry. NATO assists the
implementation of reforms and the development of strategically important
documents." [11]
Baltic Sea
After participating in NATO war games off the coast of Scotland, the
guided-missile destroyer USS Cole paid visits to the capitals of Finland and
Estonia in the Baltic Sea.
"Cole hosted a reception in Helsinki, which was
joined by Adm. Mark Fitzgerald, commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe, U.S.
Naval Forces Africa and Allied Joint Forces Command Naples."
"Immediately following the departure from Helsinki, Cole arrived in Tallinn,
Estonia, a few hours later." [12]
The beginning of this month the guided-missile frigate USS John L. Hall with
sailors of Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron 48 "completed a theater
security cooperation (TSC) port visit to Klaipeda, Lithuania."
A U.S. Navy official stated:
"We are here as part of the United States
Navy's continuing presence in the Baltic Sea....We are also here to work
with the Lithuanian Navy, who has been a valuable partner and our visit here
is part of the ongoing relationship between our two countries and our two
navies." [13] [14]
On November 3 Estonian Defense Minister Jaak Aaviksoo was at the Pentagon to
meet with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Associated Press reported on
the occasion that he was,
"discussing with the United States why NATO needs
plans in case his region is attacked." [15]
Bangladesh
In early November three high-ranking American military officials arrived in
the country. The three - U.S. Army Lieutenant General Benjamin R. Mixon,
Commanding General of U.S. Army, Pacific, Vice-Admiral John M. Bird,
Commander of U.S. Navy 7th Fleet, and U.S. Marine Corps Major General
Randolph D. Alles, Director for Strategic Planning and Policy at the U.S.
Pacific Command - engaged in discussions focusing,
"on interoperability,
readiness in the region, security-force assistance, and bilateral approaches
to maintaining regional stability." [16]
On November 12 the U.S.-led Tiger Shark military exercises to train
Bangladeshi naval commandos ended. A press release on the operation stated:
"The training demonstrates the United States government's commitment to
Bangladesh and to regional security by promoting military-to-military
relationships throughout Asia and the Pacific." [17]
Black Sea
The Pentagon's European Command (EUCOM) reported on November 2 that its
Joint Task Force-East had completed an almost three-month series of
trainings in Bulgaria and Romania which began on August 7 and included
Stryker and Airborne units destined for the war in Afghanistan. [18]
"Nearly
600 members of the Romanian Land Forces, 500 Bulgarian Land Forces, and more
than 1,500 U.S. service members participated in this year's combined
training." [19]
After U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden's visit to the country on October 22,
a news source in Romania wrote of Washington's new interceptor missile
plans:
"A strong and modern surveillance system located in Romania, Bulgaria
and Turkey could monitor three hot areas at once: the Black Sea, the
Caucasus and the Caspian and relevant zones in the Middle East." [20]
Colombia
The Obama administration signed a ten-year military treaty with the Alvaro
Uribe government on September 30 which,
"gives American military forces
access to seven Colombian army, navy and air force bases, but also to major
international civilian airports in the country. In addition, U.S. personnel
and defense contractors will enjoy diplomatic immunity under the agreement."
[21]
A copy of the pact surfaced on November 4 and detailed that it,
"allows
Washington access to civilian airports as well as military bases" and as a
result "the US will have access to all international airports across the
Andean nation including airports in the cities of Barranquilla, San Andres,
Cartagena, Bogota, Cali, Medellin and Bucaramanga." [22]
In the initial phase an estimated 1,400 U.S. personnel will be assigned to
the seven bases with the likelihood that the number will be increased as
Washington sees fit. [23]
Eva Golinger observed that one of the newly acquired bases, that at
Palanquero, was identified by a American Air Force document as providing the
Pentagon "an opportunity for conducting full spectrum operations throughout
South America...." [24]
Two South American nations bordering or near Colombia, Venezuela and
Bolivia, were not slow to respond.
Earlier this month Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez stated in his weekly
radio and television address that,
"We cannot waste one day to fulfill our
mission: to prepare for war and help the people to get ready for war,"
[25]
warning that an armed conflict with the U.S. client regime in Bogota "could
extend throughout the whole continent." [26]
Days earlier two Venezuelan National Guard troops were killed at a
checkpoint near Colombia and Caracas deployed 15,000 troops to the border.
In his November 13 address Chavez added.
"Don't make a mistake, Mr. Obama,
by ordering an attack against Venezuela by way of Colombia." [27]
On the same day his Bolivian counterpart, President Evo Morales, warned,
"I
am convinced that where there are military bases, the social peace, the
democracy and the development of the nations as well as their integration
are not guaranteed. These facilities are an open provocation against the
peace."
Morales also said that he failed to comprehend how the American head of
state could have been awarded the Peace Nobel Price
"when his country does
everything to promote wars and conflicts. Obama must justify that award by withdrawing all the troops of his country
from around the world...." [28]
Czech Republic
Following up on his visit to Prague in late October, on November 5 U.S. Vice
President Joseph Biden hosted Czech President Vaclav Klaus at the White
House and "they mostly discussed the U.S. plan for a new missile
defense
architecture."
The two,
"also talked about the situation in Afghanistan and Iran" and "Klaus
said the United States knows that it is necessary to continue with the
anti-missile project in Europe." [29]
The next day U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Alexander Vershbow met with Czech
defense officials in their nation to discuss new American missile plans for
Eastern Europe, ones intended to be "stronger, smarter, and swifter" than
the previous Bush administration version and to incorporate all of Europe
under a NATO umbrella.
Vershbow characterized the content of the talks as having presented,
"some
concrete ideas to begin that process of developing the Czech role in the new
approach" and said that the Czech contribution could include "potential
facilities here on the territory of the Czech Republic." [30]
On November 4 the local press announced that,
"A few U.S. delegations will
visit the Czech Republic in November, following up on the recent visit by
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, including an expert military team that
arrives in Prague this Friday."
One of those delegations will include Under Secretary of State for Arms
Control and International Security Affairs Ellen Tauscher, who,
"recently
said the command for the managing and control of elements of the new version
of anti-missile defense could be stationed in the Czech Republic."
"The USA wants to build the system in cooperation with NATO."
[31]
Georgia
Earlier this week U.S. Marines completed the two-week Immediate Response
2009 military training exercises in the South Caucasus nation of Georgia.
The preceding maneuvers of the same name, those of 2008 in which over 1,000
American troops participated, ended one day before Georgia started shelling
neighboring South Ossetia and killed several people including a Russian
peacekeeper. [32]
Days after that the U.S. client regime launched an all-out invasion of South
Ossetia, triggering a five-day war with Russia.
The official purpose of this year's exercises was to train Georgian troops
to serve under NATO command in Afghanistan, but a Russian news source saw
matters differently:
"Immediate Response was clearly designed not to fight against the Taliban or
al-Qaeda.....Commander of US Army in Europe General Carter Ham visited
Georgia to inspect the exercises but no one came from Afghanistan."
"Perhaps, the exercises were aimed at issuing a warning to Russia."
[33]
As the drills were ending Alexander Shliakhturov, chief of Russia's military
intelligence, said "that he did not rule out that Georgia might again use
force against breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia." [34]
A lengthier account of Shliakhturov's concerns appeared in the Georgian
media and included these quotes:
"According to our information, Georgia is still getting military aid from
Ukraine, Israel and NATO. NATO countries, especially Eastern European
countries, provide Georgia with arms and equipment, Israel provides Georgia
with air equipment, the USA trains Georgian troops and Ukraine provides
Georgia with heavy equipment, namely, tanks."
"The Russian Intelligence Service is addressing other dangers too, namely,
the efforts being made by the USA and NATO to bring Georgia and Ukraine into
the alliance and the new US plan to locate anti-missile systems in Europe."
[35]
Four days later other Russian sources revealed,
"that the United States plans
to supply weapons, including a Patriot-3 air defense system and
shoulder-launched Stinger missiles, worth a total of $100 million, to
Georgia." [36]
The next day Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov,
"recalled the situation
in the summer of 2008 when many countries ignored Russian warnings that
modern arms in Saakashvilis hands might prompt this man to unleash military
aggression." [37]
The chief of the Russian General Staff, General Nikolai Makarov, said,
"Georgia is getting large amounts of weapons supplied from abroad" and
"Georgian military potential is currently higher than last August [2008]."
[38]
India
Shortly after the Pentagon wrapped up the largest joint U.S.-Indian military
exercises ever, Yudh Abhyas [Preparation for War] - which featured the first
deployment of new American Stryker armored combat vehicles outside of Iraq
and Afghanistan - at the end of October [39], it was announced that,
"India
is negotiating with the United States to acquire state of the art Javelin
anti-tank missiles worth several million dollars for large-scale induction."
[40]
Days earlier former president George W. Bush was in India and called on his
host nation to join in the war in Afghanistan, urging the U.S. and India to
"work together to win the war in Afghanistan." [41]
Iraq
In early November Arabic language news sources revealed that,
"The US
military has finished erecting an advanced radar system in Iraq to monitor
the border with Iran, Syria and Turkey" and that "the radar is a preparatory
measure aimed at providing the United States and its allies advanced control
capabilities in event of a US military strike against Iranian nuclear
facilities." [42]
Israel
The largest-ever joint American-Israeli military exercises, the two-week
Juniper Cobra 10, ended on November 3. They concentrated on live-fire
missile interception exercises described by many observers as a test run for
the new continent-wide NATO missile shield planned for Europe. [43]
Over 2,000 troops from the two nations and 17 U.S. warships participated in
the war games to create,
"the infrastructure that would be necessary in the
event that the Obama administration decides to deploy US systems here in the
event of a conflict." [44]
The top military commander of United States European Command and of NATO,
Admiral James Stavridis, paid a three-day call to Israel for the occasion
and met with,
"Chief of the General Staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, the
Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Maj. Gen. Benjamin Gantz and several
other commanders." [45]
On November 1 American arms manufacturer Raytheon Company announced that it
had secured contracts worth $100 million for a joint interceptor missile
program of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the Israel Missile Defense
Organization.
The Pentagon's European Command has over 100 troops stationed in Israel's
Negev Desert manning an advanced missile radar site there.
Korean Peninsula
The South Korean Yonhap News Agency reported on November 1 that "The US and
South Korea have completed joint action plans for responding to a regime
collapse and other internal emergency situations in North Korea...." [46]
Citing an unidentified South Korean official, the report contains these
details:
"South Korea and the US had long worked on Concept Plan 5029, to prepare for
a regime collapse and other internal emergencies in North Korea.
Since its inauguration last year, the [South Korean President] Lee
Myung-bak government has pushed to convert the concept plan into an
operational plan and it was recently completed.
"If the South Korea-US combined forces intervene in North Korea's internal
instabilities, the South Korean military will assume the leading role in
consideration of neighboring countries, while the US military will be
responsible for the removal of the North's nuclear facilities and weapons."
[47]
On the final day of last month Washington expressed its satisfaction at
South Korea redeploying troops to Afghanistan shortly after Pentagon chief
Robert Gates' visit to Seoul and the South Korean defense ministry on
October 22.
"Washington supports and welcomes South Korea's plans to deploy troops to
Afghanistan...the U.S. Department of State said." [48]
Kosovo
This month began with former U.S. president Bill Clinton arriving in the
capital of Kosovo for the unveiling of a gaudy 11-foot gold-sprayed bronze
statue of himself on November 1. [49]
He was being hailed by the breakaway entity's nominal prime minister, former
Kosovo Liberation Army chieftain Hashim Thaci, for his role in launching the
78-day NATO air war against Yugoslavia in March of 1999.
That sustained
bombing campaign, Operation Allied Force, inaugurated the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization as an active war-making machine and issued in the
ten-year war cycle that continues to this day with no indication of it ever
abating.
A Russian commentary of the following day put the ceremony in perspective:
"Over the course of the 10-week conflict, NATO aircraft flew over 38,000
combat missions; even the German Luftwaffe had its first taste of combat
over the skies of Yugoslavia since having its wings clipped in World War II.
"The ensuing 78-day aerial bombardment campaign, which grew continuously
more aggressive and reckless, spared little infrastructure: factories,
bridges, roads and power stations were all bombed with deadly accuracy. As a
result, thousands of innocent civilians suffered great deprivation on both
sides of the battle.
"In perhaps the worst public relations disaster for NATO during the
conflict, five US 'smart' bombs severely damaged the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, killing three Chinese journalists. NATO officials, in an effort to
cool Chinese outrage, blamed the error on outdated maps. Chinese officials
rejected both the apologies and explanations." [50]
Pakistan
Over the past year the nine-year-long U.S. and NATO war in Afghanistan has
been extended into Pakistan, the so-called AfPak theater of operations.
On November 4 the U.S. launched its latest drone missile attack into North
Waziristan, killing two Pakistanis.
"According to independent reports, since August 2008 alone, around 70
cross-border predator strikes carried out by American drones have resulted
in the death of 687 Pakistani civilians." [51]
The Nation, a Pakistani daily newspaper, reported on November 12 that the
massive increase in NATO convoys crossing the country en route to
Afghanistan are overwhelming the country's highways and that,
"Pakistani
authorities are simply helpless in checking truckloads of North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) forces badly damaging the Indus Highway, the
repair of which would cost billions of rupees to the national
exchequer... NATO trucks and trailers have not been [held accountable] even
once for the repair and maintenance work, while cracks are developing on the
Indus Highway after every three to four months due to overloading...."
[52]
Persian Gulf
A local news sources wrote on November 9 that,
"The US has deployed a new expeditionary
force in the Persian Gulf - the first time a permanent
self-sustaining US naval force has been set up in the region."
"The newly established Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) 5 will serve in the
area of responsibility of the US Navy 5th Fleet Combined Task Force (CTF) 51
in Manama, Bahrain," where the entire U.S. Fifth Fleet is based. [53]
The Philippines
Two American servicemen were killed in a mine attack in Mindanao in late
September, the first official deaths in the U.S.-assisted counterinsurgency
war against not only the Abu Sayyaf Group but also the Moro National
Liberation Front and the New People's Army.
Filipino senators,
"called for the abrogation of the [Visiting Forces
Agreement], saying the US Seabees killed in the explosion weren't supposed
to be there, as...the presence of the alleged land mine constitutes the area
as a war zone." [54]
Pentagon chief Robert Gates insisted earlier in the month "that some 600 US
counter-terrorism troops will remain in the southern Philippines...."
[55]
An opponent of the active American military involvement in the country said
that,
"the US military has established its permanent presence in the
Philippines through the auspices of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA).
Many of the US soldiers are currently deployed in Mindanao under the Joint
Special Operations Task Force-Philippines headquartered in Zamboanga City."
[56]
On November 12 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in Manila after the
Philippine Senate recently passed a nonbinding resolution calling on the
government to renegotiate the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement,
"which enables
U.S. forces to train and assist Philippine troops" and "vowed...to continue
American military support." [57]
Poland
Before departing for the Philippines Clinton hosted Polish Foreign Minister
Radoslaw Sikorski in Washington "to discuss the new anti-missile shield
plan." [58]
On the same day, November 2, U.S. Air Force personnel transferred five C-130
Hercules military cargo planes from the Ramstein Air Base in Germany to the
Powidz Air Base in Poland.
A U.S. Air Force website offered these details:
"Prepping Polish aircrews
and maintainers for the transition to the larger Lockheed-Martin built
Hercules has been accomplished with a blend of English language and
specialty knowledge training at bases in Texas and Arkansas and through a
type of work mentorship exchange between U.S. and Polish air force
personnel...."
A Polish air force officer revealed the purpose of the U.S. transfer in
stating,
"The main task for the C-130s is to support our contingency
operations in Afghanistan, Chad, Africa and everywhere Polish troops and
supplies are needed." [59]
After NATO defense chiefs, including the U.S.'s Gates, met in Slovakia late
last month and U.S. Vice President Biden visited Poland at about the same
time, Warsaw announced that it was deploying 600 more troops to Afghanistan,
bringing the nation's total toward the 3,000 mark.
Sweden
Sweden's Chief of Defense Staff General Sverker Goranson was in Washington,
D.C. in early November and was interviewed by Defense News.
His nation, which has for decades presented itself as neutral, has 500
troops serving under NATO command in Afghanistan - Sweden and Finland are in
charge of four northern provinces for the NATO-led International Security
Assistance Force - and five Swedish soldiers were injured in a roadside bomb
explosion on November 11, two them seriously.
Goranson's comments demonstrate how far from anything resembling neutrality
Sweden has recently strayed:
"The transformation we are conducting is a huge turnaround, and as I told
Adm. [Michael] Mullen [U.S. Joint Chiefs chairman], we know where we are
going....The major shift is globalization and the fact that most of the
things we are dealing with aren't necessarily about national boundaries.
"What turned Sweden around is not focusing on national defense, but being a
part of this globalized world and solving issues together, because wherever
conflicts are, whether in the Balkans or Afghanistan...."
When asked about the potential for a showdown in the Arctic Circle with
Russia, he spoke about starting,
"discussions between the United States,
Norway, Denmark and Canada [all NATO members] about what are the
borders....As part of the Nordic Battle Group, Sweden, Finland, Norway and
Denmark are already sharing the operational picture in the air and on the
sea, and that can be extended to the High North."
Lastly, the Swedish visitor, whose meetings included one with the U.S.'s top
military commander, acknowledged:
"We had a defense resolution in 1996 that
said the Swedish armed forces should be completely NATO-interoperable, which
is the standard we have worked to accordingly, to make sure that wherever we
go, as we did to Afghanistan." [60]
Yemen
The government of Yemen is waging military operations against Shiite rebels
in the north of the country and neighboring Saudi Arabia started launching
air strikes against them earlier this month.
On November 10 Yemen's official news agency, Saba, announced that the U.S.
has signed a military cooperation agreement with the nation.
The news agency also quoted Brigadier General Jeffrey Smith, the commander
of the U.S. 5th Signal Command,
"as renewing Washington's support for
Yemen's unity, security and stability." [61]
One account of the agreement was provided under the headline "Yemen, US sign
military deal to fight rebels." [62]
As the rebels are Shiite Muslims, Washington is exploiting the conflict to
recruit Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations against Iran.
Yemen, on the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula, lies directly across
from Djibouti where the Pentagon maintains its only permanent base in
Africa, Camp Lemonier, and from Somalia, which U.S. warships periodically
shell from the Indian Ocean.
