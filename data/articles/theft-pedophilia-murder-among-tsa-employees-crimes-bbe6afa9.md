A Transportation Security
Administration officer
discovers unallowable liquids
in a passenger's carry on luggage at the security checkpoint
at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta
International Airport on August 3, 2011 in Atlanta.
Theft, child molestation, rape, prostitution, murder: These are just a few
of the crimes with which Transportation Security Administration (TSA)
employees have been charged in recent years.
The TSAs dismal record of properly recruiting and screening its employees
is the subject of
a new report from Congressman Marsha Blackburn.
The Tennessee Republicans report, based on news
accounts, details just 50 of the dozens of crimes for which TSA employees
have been arrested since 2005.
Fifteen of the cases involved the theft of airplane passengers possessions.
While TSA officers are required to screen all passengers possessions before
letting passengers board planes, a number of these officers have helped
themselves to cash, debit cards, laptop computers, iPads, and even
painkillers.
A screener at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood
International Airport lifted
over $50,000 worth of electronics from the
people he was supposedly serving, often selling them on the Internet before
his shift had even ended. Screeners at New Yorks John F. Kennedy
International Airport have
stolen tens of thousands of dollars in cash; two
who swiped $40,000 got a whopping
six months jail time for their crimes.
As of a year ago 500 TSA officers had been,
fired or suspended for stealing from
passenger luggage since
2001,
according to Hot Air.
And these are just the ones who got caught.
Theft is followed closely by sex crimes and child pornography charges, with
14 such incidents listed in Blackburns report.
Six TSA employees were charged with possession
of child pornography; one of them got caught because he,
uploaded explicit pictures of young girls
to an Internet site on which he also posted a photograph of himself in
his TSA uniform, the report notes.
Eight others were charged variously with child
molestation, rape (including child rape), and even running a prostitution
ring.
Its not hard to figure out why persons
possessing such proclivities would seek jobs where they would be able to
ogle and grope other peoples private parts with impunity.
Speaking of ogling others privates, one such viewing precipitated one of
the five incidents of assault in the report. Rolando Negrin, a TSA screener
at Miami International Airport,
beat one of his coworkers for making fun of
the small size of his genitalia after spotting it during a body-scanner training
exercise. Another assaulted an airport employee over a parking space.
Still another threw a cup of hot coffee at an
American Airlines pilot who asked her and other TSA workers to refrain from
using profanity on duty - apparently an unreasonable request as far as she
was concerned.
Three TSA employees were arrested for bribery. One accepted part of the
proceeds of theft from passengers to keep quiet; another took money to help
smuggle marijuana through Los Angeles International Airport; and the third
scored $200 to ensure that a fellow TSA employee passed his screening test.
Other TSA employees were charged with crimes involving drugs, illegal
firearms (in some cases trying to sneak them past TSA checkpoints), airport
screening failures, conspiracy, impersonating a federal officer, and driving
under the influence of alcohol.
One top TSA official in Mississippi was even
charged with stabbing to death another TSA employee with whom he had
allegedly been having an affair.
Blackburn writes that the TSAs response to practically every incident
detailed in her report was,
The unacceptable behavior of a few
individuals in no way reflects the dedication of our nearly 50,000
Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) who work tirelessly to keep our
skies safe.
Yet as she points out,
what TSA fails to recognize is that the
collective actions of TSOs repeatedly appearing in our national
headlines and being arrested for serious crimes does in fact reflect
poorly on TSAs nearly 50,000 Transportation Security Officers.
Moreover, she observes, if the TSA were really
serious about having the best workforce available, it would not recruit new
employees by placing ads on pizza boxes and gas pumps (as it did in the D.C.
area), and it would,
consistently conduct criminal and credit
background checks on new and existing employees,
...something the House Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure has been repeatedly told is not done, TSA
assertions to the contrary notwithstanding.
In addition, says Blackburn,
one of the greatest threats to airline
security is the ever present insider threat.
The fact that TSA employees have assisted drug
dealers in getting past TSA checkpoints should give anyone pause.
What is to say they wouldnt do the same for
terrorists, especially if those terrorists were to dupe them into thinking
the terrorists were just drug smugglers?
Despite the ever present threat of domestic
terrorism, Blackburn declares, many Transportation Security Officers
have proven time and time again that they are unqualified to serve as
one of our nations last lines of defense.
Blackburn believes that the solution to the
problem is to improve the TSAs employee screening and training processes,
and that certainly wouldnt hurt.
A better solution, however, might be to abolish
the TSA - whose methods security expert Bruce Schneier has dubbed security
theater - and let the private sector, which seems to secure numerous
locations and events with minimal inconvenience to the public, try its hand
at protecting plane passengers.
Goodness knows weve felt the TSAs hand long
enough.
