In this lecture by Michel Chossudovsky,
he blows away the smokescreen put up by the mainstream media, that 9/11 was
an attack on America by "Islamic terrorists".
Through meticulous research, he has uncovered a
military-intelligence ploy behind the September 11 attacks, and the cover-up
and complicity of key members of the Bush Administration. According to Chossudovsky, the "war
on terror" is a complete fabrication based on the illusion that
one man,
Osama bin Laden, outwitted the $40 billion-a-year American
intelligence apparatus.
The "war on terrorism" is a war of conquest.
Globalization is the final march to the "New
World Order", dominated by Wall Street and the U.S.
military-industrial complex. September 11, 2001 provides a justification for
waging a war without borders.
Washington's agenda consists in extending the
frontiers of the American Empire to facilitate complete U.S.
corporate control, while installing within America the institutions of the
Homeland Security State.
