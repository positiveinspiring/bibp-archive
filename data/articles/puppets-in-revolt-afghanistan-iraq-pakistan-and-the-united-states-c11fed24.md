Introduction
Empires are built through the promotion and backing of local collaborators
who act at the behest of imperial rulers.
They are rewarded with the outward
symbols of authority and financial handouts, even as it is understood that
they hold their position only at the tolerance of their imperial superiors.
Imperial collaborators are referred to,
-
by the occupied people and the
colonial resistance as puppets or traitors
-
by western journalists and
critics as clients
-
by the imperial scribes and officials as
loyal allies as long as they remain obedient to their sponsors and
paymaster
Puppet rulers have a long and ignoble history during the 20th century.
Subsequent to US invasions in Central America and the Caribbean a whole
string of bloody puppet dictators were put in power to implement policies
favorable to US corporations and banks and to back US regional dominance.
-
Duvalier (father and son) in Haiti
-
Trujillo in the Dominion Republic
-
Batista in Cuba
-
Somoza (father and son) in Nicaragua,
...and a host of other
tyrants served to safeguard imperial military and economic interests, while
plundering the economies and ruling with an iron fist.
Rule via puppets is characteristic of most empires. The British excelled in
propping up tribal chiefs as tax collectors, backing Indian royalty to
muster sepoys to serve under British generals. The French cultivated
francophone African elite to provide cannon fodder for its imperial wars in
Europe and Africa.
Late imperial countries like Japan set up puppet
regimes in Manchuria and Germany promoted the Vichy puppets in occupied
France and the Quisling regime in Norway.
Post-Colonial Rule -
Nationalists and Neo-Colonial Puppets
Powerful national liberation, anti-colonial movements following World War
II, challenged European and US imperial dominance in Africa, Asia and Latin
America.
Faced with the enormous costs of reconstruction in Europe and Japan
and domestic mass movements opposed to continuing colonial wars, the US and
Europe sought to retain their economic holdings, military bases via
political collaborators.
They would assume administrative, military and
political responsibilities, forging new links between the formally
independent country and their old and new imperial masters. The economic and
military institutional continuities between colonial and post-colonial
regimes were defined as neo-colonialism.
Foreign aid gave birth to and enriched an indigenous kleptocratic
bourgeoisie which provided a fig leaf to imperial resource extraction.
Military aid, training missions and overseas scholarships trained a new
generation of military and civilian bureaucrats inculcated with
imperial-centered world views and loyalties.
The
military-police-administrative apparatus was perceived by imperial rulers as
the best guarantor of the emerging order, given the fragility of
neo-colonial rulership, their narrow base of appeal and the demands of the
masses for substantive socio-economic structural changes to accompany
political independence.
The post-colonial period was riven with long term large-scale anti-imperial
social revolutions (China, Indo-China), military coups (throughout the
three continents), international civil wars (Korea) and mostly successful
nationalist-populist transformations (Iraq, India, Indonesia, Egypt,
Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Ghana, etc.).
The latter became the bases
for the non-aligned movements.
Outright colonial settler regimes (South
Africa, Israel/Palestine, Southern Rhodesia/Zimbabwe) were the exception.
Complex associations, depending on the specific power relations between
empire and local elites, generally increased income, trade and investments
for the decolonized newly independent countries.
Independence created an
internal dynamic based on large scale state intervention and a mixed
economy.
The post-colonial period of radical nationalist and socialist uprisings,
lasted less than a decade in most of the three continents. By the end of the
1970s, imperial backed coups overthrew national-populist and socialist
regimes in the Congo, Algeria, Indonesia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and
in numerous other countries.
The newly independent radical regimes in the
former Portuguese colonies, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and the
nationalist regimes and movements in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Latin
America were severely weakened by the collapse of the USSR and Chinas
conversion to capitalism. The US appeared as the sole superpower without a
military and economic counterweight.
US and European military and economic
empire builders saw an opportunity to exploit natural resources, expropriate
thousands of public enterprises, build a network of military bases and
recruit new mercenary armies to extend imperial dominance.
The question arose as to the form the new US empire would take: the means
through which the remaining nationalist rulers would be ousted.
Equally
important: with the demise of the USSR and China/Indo-Chinas conversion to
capitalism, what ideology or even argument would serve to justify the
powerful thrust of post-colonial, empire building?
Washingtons New World Order
Colonial Revivalism and Contemporary Puppetry
Western imperialisms recovery from the defeats during the national
independence struggles (1945-1970s) included the massive rebuilding of a
new imperial order.
With the collapse of the USSR, the incorporation of
Eastern Europe as imperial satellites and the subsequent conversion of
radical nationalists (Angola, Mozambique etc.) to kleptocrat free
marketers, a powerful thrust was given to White House visions of unlimited
dominance, based on projections of uncontested unilateral military power.
The spread of free market ideology between 1980 - 2000, based on the
ascendancy of neo-liberal rulers throughout Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin
America and a large swathe of Asia opened the door for unprecedented
pillage, privatizations (mostly the same thing) and the concentration of
wealth.
Corresponding to the pillage and the concentration of a unipolar
military power, a group of ultra-militarists, so-called neo-conservatives
ideologue, deeply imbued with the Israeli colonial mentality entered into
the strategic decision-making positions in Washington, with tremendous
leverage in European spheres of power - especially in England .
History went into reverse. The 1990s were inaugurated with colonial style
wars, launched against Iraq and Yugoslavia, leading to the break-up of
states and the imposition of puppet regimes in (Northern Iraq) Kurdistan,
Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia (former Yugoslavia).
Military success,
quick and low cost victories, confirmed and hardened the beliefs of the
neo-conservative and neo-liberal ideologues that empire building was the
inevitable wave of the future. Only an appropriate political trigger was
necessary to mobilize the financial and human resources to pursue the new
military driven empire.
The events of 9/11/2001 were thoroughly exploited to launch sequential wars
of colonial conquest. In the name of a word wide military crusade against
terrorism, plans were made, massive funds were allocated and a mass media
propaganda blitz was launched, to justify a series of colonial wars.
The new imperial order began with the invasion of Afghanistan (2001) and the
overthrow of the Taliban Islamic-nationalist regime, (which never had
anything to do with 9/11). Afghanistan was occupied by the US - NATO -
mercenary armies but not conquered.
The US invasion and occupation of Iraq
led to the regroupment of Islamic, nationalist and trade union anti-colonial
forces and prolonged armed and civil resistance movements.
Because of widespread nationalist and anti-Zionist influence within the
existing Iraqi civilian, police and military apparatus, neo-conservative
ideologues in Washington opted for the total dismantling of the state. They
attempted to refashion a colonial state based on sectarian leaders, local
tribal chiefdoms, foreign contractors and the appointment and clearance of
reliable exile politician as presidential or prime ministerial national
fig leafs for the colonized state.
Pakistan was a special case of imperial penetration, military intervention
and political manipulation, linking large scale military aid, bribes and
corruption to establish a puppet regime.
The latter sanctioned sustained
violations of sovereignty by US warplanes (drones and piloted), commando
operations and the large scale mobilization of the Pakistan military for US
counter-insurgency operations displacing millions of Pakistan tribal
peoples.
The Puppet Regime
Imperative
Contrary to US and EU propaganda, the invasions and occupation of Iraq and
Afghanistan and the military interventions in Pakistan were never popular.
They were actively and passively opposed by the vast majority of the
population. No sooner were the colonial civil officials imposed by force of
arms and efforts began to administer the country then passive popular and
sporadic armed resistance emerged. The colonial officials were seen for what
they were: an alien, exploitative, presence.
Treasuries were looted, the
entire economy was paralyzed, elementary services (water, electricity,
sewage systems, etc.) did not function, and millions were uprooted. The wars
and occupations radically decimated the pre-colonial society and the
colonial officials were hard pressed to create a replacement.
Billions in military spending failed to create a civil service capable of
governance. The colonial rulers had severe problems locating willing
collaborators with technical or administrative experience.
Those willing to
serve lacked even a modicum of popular acceptance.
The colonial conquest and occupation eventually settled on establishing a
parallel collaborator regime which would be financed and subordinate to the
imperial authorities. Imperial strategists believed they would provide a
political façade to legitimate and negotiate with the occupation. The
enticement to collaborate was the billions of dollars channeled into the
colonized state apparatus (and easily plundered through phony
reconstruction projects) to compensate for the risks of political
assassination by nationalist resistance fighters.
At the pinnacle of the
parallel regimes were the puppet rulers, each certified by the CIA for their
loyalty, servility and willingness to sustain imperial supremacy over the
occupied people.
They obeyed Washington s demands to privatize public
enterprises and supported Pentagon recruitment of a mercenary army under
colonial command.
Hamid Karzai was chosen as the puppet ruler in Afghanistan, based merely on
his family ties with drug traffickers and compatibility with warlords and
elders on the imperial payroll. His isolation was highlighted by the fact
that even the presidential guard was made up of US Marines.
In Iraq, US
colonial officials in consultation with the White House and the CIA chose Nouri al Maliki as the Prime Minister based on his zealous hands on
engagement in torturing resistance fighters suspected of attacking US
occupation forces.
In Pakistan the US backed a convicted felon on the lam, Asif Ali Zardari as
President. He repeatedly demonstrated his accommodating spirit by approving
large scale, long term US aerial and ground operations on the Pakistan side
of the Afghan border.
Zardari emptied the Pakistani treasury and mobilized
millions of soldiers to assault and displace frontier population centers
sympathetic to the Afghan resistance.
Puppets in Action -
Between Imperial Subservience and Mass Isolation
The three puppet regimes have provided a fig leaf for the imperial savaging
of the colonized people of the countries they preside over.
Nouri al Maliki
has over the past 5 years, not only justified the US occupation but actively
promoted the assassination and torture of thousands of anti-colonial
activists and resistance fighters. He has sold billion dollar oil and gas
concessions to overseas oil companies. He has presided over the theft
(disappearance or unaccountable) of billions of dollars in oil revenues
and US foreign aid (squeezed from US tax payers).
Hamid Karzai, who has
rarely ventured out of the presidential compound without his US Marine
bodyguards, has been ineffective in gathering even token support except
through his extended family. His main prop was narco warlord brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, killed by his CIA certified Chief of Security.
Since Karzais
domestic support is extremely narrow, his main functions include attending
external donors meetings, issuing press statements and rubber stamping each
increase (surge) in US troops. The intensified use of Special Forces death
squads and drone warplanes, inflicting high civilian casualties, has further
enraged Afghans.
The entire civilian and military apparatus nominally under Karzai is unquestionably, penetrated by Taliban and other nationalist
groups, making him totally dependent on the US troops and warlords and drug
traffickers on the CIA payroll.
The Pakistani puppet Arif Ali Zardari, despite strong resistance from
sectors of the military and intelligence agencies, and despite 85% popular
hostility to the US, has plunged the country into a series of sustained
large scale military offenses against Islamist communities in the Northeast
territories, displacing over 4 million refugees.
Under orders from the White
House to escalate the war against Taliban sanctuaries and their Pakistan
armed allies, Zardari has lost all credibility as a national politician.
He has outraged nationalist loyalties by covertly approving US gross
violations of sovereignty by allowing US Special Forces to operate from
Pakistan bases in their murderous operations against local Islamic
militants.
The daily US drone bombing of civilians in villages, on highways
and in markets has led to a near universal consensus of his puppet status.
While puppet rulers provide a useful façade for external propaganda
purposes, their effectiveness diminishes to zero domestically, as their
subservience before the imperial slaughter of non-combatants increases.
The
initial imperial propaganda ploy portraying the puppets as associate or
power-sharers loses credibility as it becomes transparent that the puppet
rulers are impotent to rectify imperial abuses. This is especially the case
with pervasive human rights violations and the destruction of the economy.
Foreign aid is widely perceived as nurturing widespread extortion,
corruption and incompetent administration of basic services.
As the domestic resistance grows and as the imperial countries will to
continue a decade long war and occupation wanes, the puppet rulers, feel
intense pressure to make, at least, token expressions of independence.
The
puppets begin to talk back to the puppet-masters, attempting to play to
the vast chorus of mass indignation over the most egregious occupation
crimes against humanity. The colonial occupation begins to sink, under the
weight of one-billion-dollars-per-week expenditures from depleted
treasuries. The token troop withdrawals signal the growing importance and
dependence on a highly suspect native mercenary force, causing the puppets
increasingly to fear for loss of office and life.
Puppet rulers begin to contemplate that it is time to probe the
possibilities of making a deal with the resistance; time to voice popular
indignation at civilian killings; time to praise the withdrawal of troops,
but nothing consequential.
No abandoning the protection of the imperial
Praetorian Guard or, god forbid, the latest tranche of foreign aid.
Its
an opportune time for Ali Zardari to criticize the US military intrusion,
killing Bin Laden; time for Al Maliki to call on the US to honor its troop
withdrawal in Iraq; time for Karzai to welcome the Afghan military takeover
of a province of least resistance (Bamiyan).
Are the puppets in some sort of
revolt against the puppet master?
Washington apparently is annoyed: $800
million in aid to Pakistan has been held up pending greater military and
intelligence collaboration in scourging the countryside and cities in search
of Islamic resistance fighters.
The Taliban assassination of Karzais
brother and top political adviser Jan Mohamed Khan, important assets in
buttering the puppet regime, signals that the puppet rulers occasional
critical emotional ejaculations are not resonating with the Taliban shadow
government which covers the nation and prepares a new military offensive.
The puppet revolts neither influence the colonial master nor attract the
anti-colonial masses. They signal the demise of a US attempt at colonial
revivalism. It spells the end of the illusion of the neo-conservative and
neo-liberal ideologists who fervently believed that US military power was
capably of invading, occupying and ruling the Islamic world via shadow
puppets projected over a mass of submissive peoples.
The colonial example of
Israel, a narrow strip of arid coastline, remains an anomaly in a sea of
independent Islamic and secular states. Efforts by its US advocates to
reproduce Israels relative consolidation through wars, occupations and
puppet regimes has instead led to the bankruptcy of the US and the collapse
of the colonial state.
Puppets will be in flight; troops are in retreat;
flags will be lowered and a period of prolonged civil war is in the
offering.
Can a democratic social revolution replace puppets and puppet
masters? We in the United States live in a time of profound and deepening
crises, in which rightwing extremism has penetrated the highest office and
has seized the initiative for now but hopefully not forever.
The overseas
colonial wars are coming to a close, are domestic wars on the horizon?
