The spring air in the small, sand-dusted town
has a soft haze to it, and clumps of green-gray sagebrush rustle in the
breeze.
Bluffdale sits in a bowl-shaped valley in
the shadow of Utahs Wasatch Range to the east and the Oquirrh Mountains to
the west. Its the heart of Mormon country, where religious pioneers first
arrived more than 160 years ago.
They came to escape the rest of the world, to
understand the mysterious words sent down from their god as revealed on
buried golden plates, and to practice what has become known as the
principle, marriage to multiple wives.
Today Bluffdale is home to one of the nations largest sects of polygamists,
the Apostolic United Brethren, with upwards of 9,000 members.
The brethrens complex includes a chapel, a
school, a sports field, and an archive. Membership has doubled since 1978 -
and the number of plural marriages has tripled - so the sect has recently
been looking for ways to purchase more land and expand throughout the town.
But new pioneers have quietly begun moving into the area, secretive
outsiders who say little and keep to themselves.
Like the pious polygamists, they are focused on
deciphering cryptic messages that only they have the power to understand.
Just off Beef Hollow Road, less than a mile from brethren headquarters,
thousands of hard-hatted construction workers in sweat-soaked T-shirts are
laying the groundwork for the newcomers own temple and archive, a massive
complex so large that it necessitated expanding the towns boundaries.
Once built, it will be more than five times the
size of the US Capitol.
Rather than Bibles, prophets, and worshippers, this temple will be filled
with servers, computer intelligence experts, and armed guards.
And instead of listening for words flowing down
from heaven, these newcomers will be secretly capturing, storing, and
analyzing vast quantities of words and images hurtling through the worlds
telecommunications networks.
In the little town of Bluffdale, Big Love and
Big Brother have become uneasy neighbors.
The NSA has become the largest, most
covert,
and potentially most intrusive intelligence
agency ever.
Under construction by contractors with
top-secret clearances, the blandly named Utah Data Center is being built for
the National Security Agency.
A project of immense secrecy, it is the final
piece in a complex puzzle assembled over the past decade. Its purpose: to
intercept, decipher, analyze, and store vast swaths of the worlds
communications as they zap down from satellites and zip through the
underground and undersea cables of international, foreign, and domestic
networks.
The heavily fortified $2 billion center should
be up and running in September 2013.
Flowing through its servers and routers and
stored in near-bottomless databases will be all forms of communication,
including the complete contents of private emails, cell phone calls, and
Google searches, as well as all sorts of personal data trails - parking
receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases, and other digital pocket
litter.
It is, in some measure, the realization of the
total information awareness program created during the first term of the
Bush administration - an effort that was killed by Congress in 2003 after it
caused an outcry over its potential for invading Americans privacy.
But this is more than just a data center, says one senior intelligence
official who until recently was involved with the program.
The mammoth Bluffdale center will have another
important and far more secret role that until now has gone unrevealed. It is
also critical, he says, for breaking codes.
And code-breaking is crucial,
because much of the data that the center will handle:
...will be heavily encrypted.
According to another top official also involved
with the program,
the NSA made an enormous breakthrough
several years ago in its ability to cryptanalyze, or break, unfathomably
complex encryption systems employed by not only governments around the world
but also many average computer users in the US.
The upshot, according to this official:
Everybodys a target; everybody with
communication is a target.
For the NSA, overflowing with tens of billions
of dollars in post-9/11 budget awards, the cryptanalysis breakthrough came
at a time of explosive growth, in size as well as in power.
Established as an arm of the Department of
Defense following Pearl Harbor, with the primary purpose of preventing
another surprise assault, the NSA suffered a series of humiliations in the
post-Cold War years. Caught off-guard by an escalating series of terrorist
attacks - the first World Trade Center bombing, the blowing up of US
embassies in East Africa, the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen, and finally
the devastation of 9/11 - some began questioning the agencys very reason
for being.
In response, the NSA has quietly been reborn.
And while there is little indication that its
actual effectiveness has improved - after all, despite numerous pieces of
evidence and intelligence-gathering opportunities, it missed the
near-disastrous attempted attacks by the underwear bomber on a flight to
Detroit in 2009 and by the car bomber in Times Square in 2010 - there is no
doubt that it has transformed itself into the largest, most covert, and
potentially most intrusive intelligence agency ever created.
In the process - and for the first time since Watergate and the other
scandals of the Nixon administration - the NSA has turned its surveillance
apparatus on the US and its citizens.
It has established listening posts
throughout the nation to collect and sift through billions of email messages
and phone calls, whether they originate within the country or overseas. It
has created a supercomputer of almost unimaginable speed to look for
patterns and unscramble codes.
Finally, the agency has begun building a place
to store all the trillions of words and thoughts and whispers captured in
its electronic net. And, of course, its all being done in secret.
To those on the inside, the old adage that NSA
stands for Never Say Anything applies more than ever.
A swath of freezing fog blanketed Salt Lake City
on the morning of January 6, 2011, mixing with a weeklong coating of heavy
gray smog.
Red air alerts, warning people to stay indoors
unless absolutely necessary, had become almost daily occurrences, and the
temperature was in the bone-chilling twenties.
What I smell and taste is like coal smoke,
complained one local blogger that day.
At the citys international airport, many
inbound flights were delayed or diverted while outbound regional jets were
grounded.
But among those making it through the icy mist
was a figure whose gray suit and tie made him almost disappear into the
background. He was tall and thin, with the physique of an aging basketball
player and dark caterpillar eyebrows beneath a shock of matching hair.
Accompanied by a retinue of bodyguards, the man
was NSA deputy director Chris Inglis, the agencys highest-ranking
civilian and the person who ran its worldwide day-to-day operations.
A short time later, Inglis arrived in Bluffdale at the site of the future
data center, a flat, unpaved runway on a little-used part of Camp Williams,
a National Guard training site.
There, in a white tent set up for the occasion,
Inglis joined Harvey Davis, the agencys associate director for
installations and logistics, and Utah senator Orrin Hatch, along with a few
generals and politicians in a surreal ceremony. Standing in an odd wooden
sandbox and holding gold-painted shovels, they made awkward jabs at the sand
and thus officially broke ground on what the local media had simply dubbed
the spy center.
Hoping for some details on what was about to be
built, reporters turned to one of the invited guests, Lane Beattie of the
Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce.
Did he have any idea of the purpose behind the
new facility in his backyard?
Absolutely not, he said with a
self-conscious half laugh. Nor do I want them spying on me.
For his part, Inglis simply engaged in a bit of
double-talk, emphasizing the least threatening aspect of the center:
Its a state-of-the-art facility designed
to support the intelligence community in its mission to, in turn, enable
and protect the nations cybersecurity.
While cybersecurity will certainly be among the
areas focused on in Bluffdale, what is collected, how its collected, and
what is done with the material are far more important issues.
Battling hackers makes for a nice cover - its
easy to explain, and who could be against it?
Then the reporters turned to Hatch, who proudly
described the center as,
a great tribute to Utah, then added, I
cant tell you a lot about what theyre going to be doing, because its
highly classified.
And then there was this anomaly:
Although this was supposedly the official
ground-breaking for the nations largest and most expensive
cybersecurity project, no one from the Department of Homeland Security,
the agency responsible for protecting civilian networks from cyberattack,
spoke from the lectern.
In fact, the official whod originally
introduced the data center, at a press conference in Salt Lake City in
October 2009, had nothing to do with cybersecurity.
It was Glenn A. Gaffney, deputy director
of national intelligence for collection, a man who had spent almost his
entire career at
the CIA. As head of collection for the intelligence
community, he managed the countrys human and electronic spies.
Within days, the tent and sandbox and gold shovels would be gone and Inglis
and the generals would be replaced by some 10,000 construction workers.
Weve been asked not to talk about the
project, Rob Moore, president of Big-D Construction, one of the three
major contractors working on the project, told a local reporter.
The plans for the center show an extensive
security system:
an elaborate $10 million antiterrorism
protection program, including a fence designed to stop a 15,000-pound
vehicle traveling 50 miles per hour, closed-circuit cameras, a biometric
identification system, a vehicle inspection facility, and a
visitor-control center.
Inside, the facility will consist of four
25,000-square-foot halls filled with servers, complete with raised floor
space for cables and storage. In addition, there will be more than 900,000
square feet for technical support and administration.
The entire site will be self-sustaining, with
fuel tanks large enough to power the backup generators for three days in an
emergency, water storage with the capability of pumping 1.7 million gallons
of liquid per day, as well as a sewage system and massive air-conditioning
system to keep all those servers cool.
Electricity will come from the centers own
substation built by Rocky Mountain Power to satisfy the 65-megawatt power
demand. Such a mammoth amount of energy comes with a mammoth price tag -
about $40 million a year, according to one estimate.
Given the facilitys scale and the fact that a terabyte of data can now be
stored on a flash drive the size of a mans pinky, the potential amount of
information that could be housed in Bluffdale is truly staggering. But so is
the exponential growth in the amount of intelligence data being produced
every day by the eavesdropping sensors of the NSA and other intelligence
agencies.
As a result of this expanding array of theater
airborne and other sensor networks, as a 2007 Department of Defense report
puts it, the Pentagon is attempting to expand its worldwide communications
network, known as the Global Information Grid, to handle yottabytes (1024
bytes) of data. (A yottabyte is a septillion bytes - so large that no one
has yet coined a term for the next higher magnitude.)
It needs that capacity because, according to a recent report by Cisco,
global Internet traffic will quadruple from 2010 to 2015, reaching 966
exabytes per year. (A million exabytes equal a yottabyte.)
In terms of scale, Eric Schmidt,
Googles
former CEO, once estimated that the total of all human knowledge created
from the dawn of man to 2003 totaled 5 exabytes.
And the data flow shows no sign of slowing.
In
2011 more than 2 billion of the worlds 6.9 billion people were connected to
the Internet. By 2015, market research firm IDC estimates, there will be 2.7
billion users. Thus, the NSAs need for a 1-million-square-foot data
storehouse. Should the agency ever fill the Utah center with
a yottabyte of
information, it would be equal to about 500 quintillion
(500,000,000,000,000,000,000) pages of text.
The data stored in Bluffdale will naturally go far beyond the worlds
billions of public web pages. The NSA is more interested in the so-called
invisible web, also known as the deep web or deepnet - data beyond the reach
of the public.
This includes password-protected data, US and
foreign government communications, and noncommercial file-sharing between
trusted peers.
The deep web contains government reports,
databases, and other sources of information of high value to DOD and the
intelligence community, according to a 2010 Defense Science Board
report.
Alternative tools are needed to find and
index data in the deep web
Stealing the classified secrets of a
potential adversary is where the [intelligence] community is most
comfortable.
With its new Utah Data Center, the NSA will at
last have the technical capability to store, and rummage through, all those
stolen secrets.
The question, of course, is how the agency
defines who is, and who is not, a potential adversary.
Before
yottabytes of data from the deep web and
elsewhere can begin piling up inside the servers of the NSAs new center,
they must be collected.
To better accomplish that, the agency has
undergone the largest building boom in its history, including installing
secret electronic monitoring rooms in major US telecom facilities.
Controlled by the NSA, these highly secured spaces are where the agency taps
into the US communications networks, a practice that came to light during
the Bush years but was never acknowledged by the agency.
The broad outlines of the so-called
warrantless-wiretapping program have long been exposed - how the NSA
secretly and illegally bypassed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court,
which was supposed to oversee and authorize highly targeted domestic
eavesdropping; how the program allowed wholesale monitoring of millions of
American phone calls and email.
In the wake of the programs exposure, Congress
passed the
FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which largely made the practices
legal.
Telecoms that had agreed to participate in the
illegal activity were granted immunity from prosecution and lawsuits. What
wasnt revealed until now, however, was the enormity of this ongoing
domestic spying program.
For the first time, a former NSA official has gone on the record to describe
the program, codenamed
Stellar Wind, in detail.
William Binney was a senior NSA
crypto-mathematician largely responsible for automating the agencys
worldwide eavesdropping network. A tall man with strands of black hair
across the front of his scalp and dark, determined eyes behind thick-rimmed
glasses, the 68-year-old spent nearly four decades breaking codes and
finding new ways to channel billions of private phone calls and email
messages from around the world into the NSAs bulging databases.
As chief and one of the two cofounders of the
agencys Signals Intelligence Automation Research Center, Binney and his
team designed much of the infrastructure thats still likely used to
intercept international and foreign communications.
He explains that the agency could have installed its tapping gear at the
nations cable landing stations - the more than two dozen sites on the
periphery of the US where fiber-optic cables come ashore. If it had taken
that route, the NSA would have been able to limit its eavesdropping to just
international communications, which at the time was all that was allowed
under US law.
Instead it chose to put the wiretapping rooms at
key junction points throughout the country - large, windowless buildings
known as switches - thus gaining access to not just international
communications but also to most of the domestic traffic flowing through the
US.
The network of intercept stations goes far
beyond the single room in an AT&T building in San Francisco exposed by a
whistle-blower in 2006.
I think theres 10 to 20 of them, Binney
says. Thats not just San Francisco; they have them in the middle of
the country and also on the East Coast.
The eavesdropping on Americans doesnt stop at
the telecom switches.
To capture satellite communications in and out
of the US, the agency also monitors AT&Ts powerful earth stations,
satellite receivers in locations that include Roaring Creek and Salt Creek.
Tucked away on a back road in rural Catawissa,
Pennsylvania, Roaring Creeks three 105-foot dishes handle much of the
countrys communications to and from Europe and the Middle East.
And on an isolated stretch of land in remote
Arbuckle, California, three similar dishes at the companys Salt Creek
station service the Pacific Rim and Asia.
The former NSA official held his thumb and
forefinger close together:
We are that far from a turnkey totalitarian
state.
Binney left the NSA in late 2001, shortly after
the agency launched its warrantless-wiretapping program.
They violated the Constitution setting it
up, he says bluntly. But they didnt care. They were going to do it
anyway, and they were going to crucify anyone who stood in the way. When
they started violating the Constitution, I couldnt stay.
Binney says Stellar Wind was far larger than has
been publicly disclosed and included not just eavesdropping on domestic
phone calls but the inspection of domestic email.
At the outset the program recorded 320 million
calls a day, he says, which represented about 73 to 80 percent of the total
volume of the agencys worldwide intercepts. The haul only grew from there.
According to Binney - who has maintained close
contact with agency employees until a few years ago - the taps in the secret
rooms dotting the country are actually powered by highly sophisticated
software programs that conduct deep packet inspection, examining Internet
traffic as it passes through the 10-gigabit-per-second cables at the speed
of light.
The software, created by a
company called Narus thats now part of Boeing,
is controlled remotely from NSA headquarters at Fort Meade in Maryland and
searches US sources for target addresses, locations, countries, and phone
numbers, as well as watch-listed names, keywords, and phrases in email.
Any communication that arouses suspicion,
especially those to or from the million or so people on agency watch lists,
are automatically copied or recorded and then transmitted to the NSA.
The scope of surveillance expands from there, Binney says.
Once a name is entered into the Narus database,
all phone calls and other communications to and from that person are
automatically routed to the NSAs recorders.
Anybody you want, route to a recorder,
Binney says. If your numbers in there? Routed and gets recorded.
He
adds,
The Narus device allows you to take it all.
And when Bluffdale is completed, whatever is
collected will be routed there for storage and analysis.
According to Binney, one of the deepest secrets of the Stellar Wind program
- again, never confirmed until now - was that the NSA gained warrantless
access to AT&Ts vast trove of domestic and international billing records,
detailed information about who called whom in the US and around the world.
As of 2007, AT&T had more than 2.8 trillion records housed in a database at
its Florham Park, New Jersey, complex.
Verizon was also part of the program, Binney says, and that greatly expanded
the volume of calls subject to the agencys domestic eavesdropping.
That multiplies the call rate by at least a
factor of five, he says. So youre over a billion and a half calls a
day.
(Spokespeople for Verizon and AT&T said
their companies would not comment on matters of national security.)
After he left the NSA, Binney suggested a system
for monitoring peoples communications according to how closely they are
connected to an initial target.
The further away from the target - say youre
just an acquaintance of a friend of the target - the less the surveillance.
But the agency rejected the idea, and, given the
massive new storage facility in Utah, Binney suspects that it now simply
collects everything.
The whole idea was, how do you manage 20
terabytes of intercept a minute? he says. The way we proposed was to
distinguish between things you want and things you dont want. Instead,
he adds, theyre storing everything they gather.
And the agency is gathering as much as it can.
Once the communications are intercepted and stored, the data-mining begins.
You can watch everybody all the time with
data- mining, Binney says. Everything a person does becomes charted on
a graph, financial transactions or travel or anything, he says.
Thus, as data like bookstore receipts, bank
statements, and commuter toll records flow in, the NSA is able to paint a
more and more detailed picture of someones life.
The NSA also has the ability to eavesdrop on phone calls directly and in
real time.
According to Adrienne J. Kinne, who
worked both before and after 9/11 as a voice interceptor at the NSA facility
in Georgia, in the wake of the World Trade Center attacks,
basically all rules were thrown out the
window, and they would use any excuse to justify a waiver to spy on
Americans.
Even journalists calling home from overseas were
included.
A lot of time you could tell they were calling their families,
she says, incredibly intimate, personal conversations.
Kinne found the act of eavesdropping on innocent
fellow citizens personally distressing.
Its almost like going through and finding
somebodys diary, she says.
In secret listening rooms nationwide,
NSA software examines
every email, phone call, and tweet as they zip
by.
But there is, of course, reason for anyone to be
distressed about the practice.
Once the door is open for the government to spy
on US citizens, there are often great temptations to abuse that power for
political purposes, as when Richard Nixon eavesdropped on his political
enemies during Watergate and ordered the NSA to spy on antiwar protesters.
Those and other abuses prompted Congress to
enact prohibitions in the mid-1970s against domestic spying. Before he gave
up and left the NSA, Binney tried to persuade officials to create a more
targeted system that could be authorized by a court.
At the time, the agency had 72 hours to obtain a
legal warrant, and Binney devised a method to computerize the system.
I had proposed that we automate the process
of requesting a warrant and automate approval so we could manage a
couple of million intercepts a day, rather than subvert the whole
process.
But such a system would have required close
coordination with the courts, and NSA officials werent interested in that,
Binney says.
Instead they continued to haul in data on a
grand scale.
Asked how many communications - transactions, in NSAs lingo
- the agency has intercepted since 9/11, Binney estimates the number at
between 15 and 20 trillion, the aggregate over 11 years.
When Barack Obama took office, Binney hoped the new administration
might be open to reforming the program to address his constitutional
concerns.
He and another former senior NSA analyst, J.
Kirk Wiebe, tried to bring the idea of an automated warrant-approval
system to the attention of the Department of Justices inspector general.
They were given the brush-off.
They said, oh, OK, we cant comment,
Binney says.
Sitting in a restaurant not far from NSA
headquarters, the place where he spent nearly 40 years of his life, Binney
held his thumb and forefinger close together.
We are, like, that far from a
turnkey
totalitarian state, he says.
There is still one technology preventing
untrammeled government access to private digital data: strong encryption.
Anyone - from terrorists and weapons dealers to corporations, financial
institutions, and ordinary email senders - can use it to seal their
messages, plans, photos, and documents in hardened data shells.
For years, one of the hardest shells has been
the Advanced Encryption Standard, one of several algorithms used by much of
the world to encrypt data.
Available in three different strengths - 128
bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits - its incorporated in most commercial email
programs and web browsers and is considered so strong that the NSA has even
approved its use for top-secret US government communications.
Most experts say that a so-called brute-force
computer attack on the algorithm - trying one combination after another to
unlock the encryption - would likely take longer than the age of the
universe. For a 128-bit cipher, the number of trial-and-error attempts would
be 340 undecillion (1036).
Breaking into those complex mathematical shells like the AES is one of the
key reasons for the construction going on in Bluffdale.
That kind of cryptanalysis requires two major
ingredients: super-fast computers to conduct brute-force attacks on
encrypted messages and a massive number of those messages for the computers
to analyze.
The more messages from a given target, the more
likely it is for the computers to detect telltale patterns, and Bluffdale
will be able to hold a great many messages.
We questioned it one time, says another
source, a senior intelligence manager who was also involved with the
planning. Why were we building this NSA facility? And, boy, they rolled
out all the old guys - the crypto guys.
According to the official, these experts told
then-director of national intelligence Dennis Blair,
Youve got to build this thing because we
just dont have the capability of doing the code-breaking.
It was a candid admission. In the long war
between the code breakers and the code makers - the tens of thousands of
cryptographers in the worldwide computer security industry - the code
breakers were admitting defeat.
So the agency had one major ingredient - a massive data storage facility -
under way. Meanwhile, across the country in Tennessee, the government was
working in utmost secrecy on the other vital element: the most powerful
computer the world has ever known.
The plan was launched in 2004 as a modern-day Manhattan Project.
Dubbed the High Productivity Computing
Systems program, its goal was to advance computer speed a thousand-fold,
creating a machine that could execute a quadrillion (1015) operations a
second, known as a
petaflop - the computer equivalent of breaking the land
speed record.
And as with the Manhattan Project, the venue
chosen for the supercomputing program was the town of Oak Ridge in eastern
Tennessee, a rural area where sharp ridges give way to low, scattered hills,
and the southwestward-flowing Clinch River bends sharply to the southeast.
About 25 miles from Knoxville, it is the secret city where uranium- 235
was extracted for the first atomic bomb. A sign near the exit read: what you
see here, what you do here, what you hear here, when you leave here, let it
stay here.
Today, not far from where that sign stood, Oak
Ridge is home to the Department of Energys Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
and its engaged in a new secret war.
But this time, instead of a bomb of almost
unimaginable power, the weapon is a computer of almost unimaginable speed.
In 2004, as part of the supercomputing program, the Department of Energy
established its Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility for multiple
agencies to join forces on the project.
But in reality there would be two tracks,
-
one
unclassified, in which all of the scientific work would be public
-
another top-secret, in which the NSA could pursue its own computer covertly
For our purposes, they had to create a
separate facility, says a former senior NSA computer expert who worked
on the project and is still associated with the agency. (He is one of
three sources who described the program.)
It was an expensive undertaking, but one the NSA
was desperate to launch.
Known as the Multiprogram Research Facility, or Building 5300,
the $41 million, five-story, 214,000-square-foot structure was built on a
plot of land on the labs East Campus and completed in 2006. Behind the
brick walls and green-tinted windows, 318 scientists, computer engineers,
and other staff work in secret on the cryptanalytic applications of
high-speed computing and other classified projects.
The supercomputer center was named in honor of
George R. Cotter, the NSAs now-retired chief scientist and head of
its information technology program.
Not that youd know it.
Theres no sign on the door, says the ex-NSA
computer expert.
At the DOEs unclassified center at Oak Ridge,
work progressed at a furious pace, although it was a one-way street when it
came to cooperation with the closemouthed people in Building 5300.
Nevertheless, the unclassified team had its
Cray
XT4 supercomputer upgraded to a warehouse-sized
XT5. Named Jaguar for its
speed, it clocked in at 1.75 petaflops, officially becoming the worlds
fastest computer in 2009.
Meanwhile, over in Building 5300, the NSA succeeded in building an even
faster supercomputer.
They made a big breakthrough, says another
former senior intelligence official, who helped oversee the program.
The NSAs machine was likely similar to the
unclassified Jaguar, but it was much faster out of the gate, modified
specifically for cryptanalysis and targeted against one or more specific
algorithms, like the AES.
In other words, they were moving from the
research and development phase to actually attacking extremely difficult
encryption systems. The code-breaking effort was up and running.
The breakthrough was enormous, says the former official, and soon afterward
the agency pulled the shade down tight on the project, even within the
intelligence community and Congress.
Only the chairman and vice chairman and the
two staff directors of each intelligence committee were told about it,
he says.
The reason?
They were thinking that this computing
breakthrough was going to give them the ability to crack current public
encryption.
In addition to giving the NSA access to a
tremendous amount of Americans personal data, such an advance would also
open a window on a trove of foreign secrets.
While today most sensitive communications use
the strongest encryption, much of the older data stored by the NSA,
including a great deal of what will be transferred to Bluffdale once the
center is complete, is encrypted with more vulnerable ciphers.
Remember, says the former intelligence
official, a lot of foreign government stuff weve never been able to
break is 128 or less. Break all that and youll find out a lot more of
what you didnt know - stuff weve already stored - so theres an
enormous amount of information still in there.
The NSA believes its on the verge of
breaking a key encryption algorithm - opening up
hoards of data.
That, he notes, is where the value of Bluffdale,
and its mountains of long-stored data, will come in.
What cant be broken today may be broken
tomorrow.
Then you can see what they were saying in
the past, he says. By extrapolating the way they did business, it
gives us an indication of how they may do things now.
The danger, the former official says, is that
its not only foreign government information that is locked in weaker
algorithms, its also a great deal of personal domestic communications, such
as Americans email intercepted by the NSA in the past decade.
But first the supercomputer must break the encryption, and to do that, speed
is everything. The faster the computer, the faster it can break codes. The
Data Encryption Standard, the 56-bit predecessor to the AES, debuted in 1976
and lasted about 25 years.
The AES made its first appearance in 2001 and is
expected to remain strong and durable for at least a decade. But if the NSA
has secretly built a computer that is considerably faster than machines in
the unclassified arena, then the agency has a chance of breaking the AES in
a much shorter time.
And with Bluffdale in operation, the NSA will
have the luxury of storing an ever-expanding archive of intercepts until
that breakthrough comes along.
But despite its progress, the agency has not finished building at Oak Ridge,
nor is it satisfied with breaking the petaflop barrier. Its next goal is to
reach exaflop speed, one quintillion (1018) operations a second, and
eventually zettaflop (1021) and yottaflop.
These goals have considerable support in Congress. Last November a
bipartisan group of 24 senators sent a letter to President Obama urging him
to approve continued funding through 2013 for the Department of Energys
exascale computing initiative (the NSAs budget requests are classified).
They cited the necessity to keep up with and
surpass China and Japan.
The race is on to develop exascale
computing capabilities, the senators noted.
The reason was clear:
By late 2011 the Jaguar (now with a peak
speed of 2.33 petaflops) ranked third behind Japans K Computer, with
an impressive 10.51 petaflops, and the Chinese Tianhe-1A system, with
2.57 petaflops.
But the real competition will take place in the
classified realm.
To secretly develop the new exaflop (or higher)
machine by 2018, the NSA has proposed constructing two connecting buildings,
totaling 260,000 square feet, near its current facility on the East Campus
of Oak Ridge.
Called the Multiprogram Computational Data
Center, the buildings will be low and wide like giant warehouses, a
design necessary for the dozens of computer cabinets that will compose an
exaflop-scale machine, possibly arranged in a cluster to minimize the
distance between circuits.
According to a presentation delivered to DOE
employees in 2009, it will be an unassuming facility with limited view from
roads, in keeping with the NSAs desire for secrecy.
And it will have an extraordinary appetite for
electricity, eventually using about 200 megawatts, enough to power 200,000
homes.
The computer will also produce a gargantuan
amount of heat, requiring 60,000 tons of cooling equipment, the same amount
that was needed to serve both of the World Trade Center towers.
In the meantime Cray is working on the next step for the NSA, funded in part
by a $250 million contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA.) Its a massively parallel supercomputer called Cascade, a prototype
of which is due at the end of 2012. Its development will run largely in
parallel with the unclassified effort for the DOE and other partner
agencies.
That project, due in 2013, will upgrade the
Jaguar XT5 into an
XK6, codenamed Titan, upping its speed to 10 to 20 petaflops.
Yottabytes and exaflops, septillions and undecillions - the race for
computing speed and data storage goes on.
In his 1941 story The Library of
Babel, Jorge Luis Borges imagined a collection of information where
the entire worlds knowledge is stored but barely a single word is
understood.
In Bluffdale the NSA is constructing a library
on a scale that even Borges might not have contemplated.
And to hear the masters of the agency tell it,
its only a matter of time until every word is illuminated.
