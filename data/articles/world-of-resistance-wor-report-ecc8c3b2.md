# World of Resistance (WOR) Report

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_globalupraising71.htm

The world today is in the midst of the most monumental social, political
and economic upheavals in human history - a state of continual protests,
uprisings and what may be considered inevitable revolution on a global
scale.
Power that had been centralized for roughly 500 years among the
Atlantic powers of Western Europe and North America is rapidly shifting
to include the rise of the East, as China, India and others operating
within established, institutional frameworks of power get wooed by the
former Western imperial managers to become colluders in empire, instead
of competition.
To add to this, global wealth and power is being
centralized among a highly interconnected and transnational ruling
class:
a small
global elite who own and operate
the major banks,
corporations, foundations, think tanks, universities and international
organizations.
It is this numerically minute group of plutocrats whom
empire serves.
Long established among the Western elites, this group of
plutocrats is attempting to bring the oligarchies of other powerful and
rising states firmly within its organizational and ideological
structure.
Think of it as an established Mafia that helped build up a few other
crime families in order to extend its influence - and which now has to
contend with the increasing autonomy and competition that these
strengthened crime families pose, as it attempts to bring them closer
within the established Family instead of risking an all-out Mafia war
in which all parties would surely lose.
The changing structures of
global power, along with the ever-increasing unrest of populations
around the world, has created perhaps the most challenging situation for
any empire in human history.
Zbigniew Brzezinski has written and spoken for years on the issue,
publishing in establishment journals and speaking at elite think tanks
about what he calls the "Global Political Awakening."
Brzezinski is not
a casual observer nor a resigned academic; he sits within the heart of
the intellectual
and institutional foundations of the American empire alongside other
notable figures such as
Henry Kissinger and
Joseph Nye.
Brzezinski was
even recruited as a foreign policy adviser to the 2008 presidential
campaign of Barack Obama, who referred
to Brzezinski as,
"one of our most outstanding thinkers."
Brzezinski wrote
in 2005 that the United States needed to face,
"a centrally important
new global reality: that the worlds population is experiencing a
political awakening unprecedented in scope and intensity, with the
result that the politics of populism are transforming the politics of
power."
Thus, the "central challenge" for the U.S., noted Brzezinski,
"is posed not by global terrorism, but
rather by the intensifying turbulence caused by the phenomenon of
global political awakening. That awakening is socially massive and
politically radicalizing."
In a
2004 speech to the elite-populated Carnegie Council, Brzezinski
explained that the global awakening was partly,
"spurred by Americas
impact on the world," by virtue of the fact that America is able "to
project itself outward" and "transform the world," creating an "unsettling impact, because we are economically intrusive, [and]
culturally seductive."
In other words, American imperialism is - by its
very nature - creating its antithesis:
the global awakening.
The awakening "is also fueled by globalization," Brzezinski further
explained,
"which the United States propounds, favors and projects
by virtue of being a globally outward-thrusting society."
The process of
globalization, however,
"also contributes to instability, and is
beginning to create something altogether new: namely, some new
ideological or doctrinal challenge which might fill the void created
by the disappearance of communism."
In other words, since the end of the Cold War, when Marxism and
Communism represented the largest and most organized global ideological
challenge to Western state-capitalist democracy, Brzezinski maintains
there has been an ideological vacuum in terms of ideas opposing the
present global order.
The global awakening, however, is changing the
circumstances.
As
he stated:
"I see the beginnings, in writings and
stirrings, of the making of a doctrine which combines
anti-Americanism with anti-globalization, and the two could become a
powerful force in a world that is very unequal and turbulent."
Brzezinski noted
in 2005 that,
"the population of much of the developing world is
politically stirring and in many places seething with unrest," having
become "acutely conscious of social injustice to an unprecedented
degree, and often resentful of its perceived lack of political dignity."
A "community of shared perceptions" was being created by the spread of
radio, television and Internet access, creating the potential for
energies to be galvanized which "transcend sovereign borders and pose a
challenge both to existing states as well as to the existing global
hierarchy, on top of which America still perches."
The youth of the Third World represent,
"a demographic revolution,"
and being "particularly restless and resentful," they also represent "a
political time-bomb... creating a huge mass of impatient young people."
The "potential revolutionary spearhead" of the Third World youth was, in
Brzezinskis view,
"likely to emerge from among the scores of
millions of students" concentrated in the educational institutions of
the developing world.
Having largely originated from,
"the socially insecure lower middle
class and inflamed by a sense of social outrage, these millions of
students are revolutionaries-in-waiting... connected by the
Internet... Their physical energy and emotional frustration is just
waiting to be triggered by a cause, or a faith, or a hatred."
In 2008, Brzezinski
wrote in the New York Times that,
"global activism is generating a
surge in the quest for cultural respect and economic opportunity in a
world scarred by memories of colonial or imperial domination."
In his
view, the necessary course of action,
"is to regain U.S. global
legitimacy by spearheading a collective effort for a more inclusive
system of global management."
Brzezinski noted, in a speech he gave that
same year to Chatham House, that,
"in the current post-colonial era, it
is too costly to undertake colonial wars" which is why the U.S. should
attempt to avoid getting further "bogged down" in the Middle East and
Central Asia, where America would be "engaged in a protracted
post-imperial war in the post-colonial age, a war not easy to win
against aroused populations."
Later, in a 2010 speech to the Canadian International Council (CIC),
an elite think tank based in Canada, Brzezinski
explained (below video) the "total new reality" of the awakening of mankind,
explaining that,
"most people know what is generally
going on... in the world, and are consciously aware of global
iniquities, inequalities, lack of respect, exploitation. Mankind is
now politically awakened and stirring."
In a 2012 speech at the European Forum for New Ideas (EFNI),
Brzezinski stated that 20 years following the end of the Cold War,
"a
truly comprehensive American global domination is no longer possible
[because] in recent decades, worldwide social change has experienced
unprecedented historical acceleration, particularly because instant mass
communications... cumulatively have been stimulating a universal
awakening of mass political consciousness."
"The resulting widespread rise in worldwide populist activism is
proving inimical to external domination of the kind that prevailed in
the age of colonialism and imperialism," he continued.
"Persistent and
highly motivated populist resistance of politically awakened and
historically resentful peoples to external control has proven to be
increasingly difficult to suppress, as protracted guerrilla warfare in
Vietnam, Algeria, or Afghanistan have amply demonstrated; and as the
rising turmoil in both the Middle East and Southwest Asia are
foreshadowing."
("The Role of the West in the Complex Post-Hegemonic
World," Speech at the European Forum for New Ideas, 26 September 2012)
As Brzezinski
explained to his fellow elites and imperialists in the United States
and other powerful Western societies:
"The worldwide yearning for human
dignity is the central challenge inherent in the phenomenon of global
political awakening."
As he stated at Chatham House in 2008, the worlds
major powers,
"new and old, also face a novel reality:
while the lethality of their military might is greater than ever,
their capacity to impose control over the politically awakened
masses of the world is at a historic low.
To put it bluntly: in earlier times, it
was easier to control one million people than to physically kill one
million people; today, it is infinitely easier to kill one million
people than to control one million people."
Institutional and imperial power structures have never been more
globalized or concentrated in human history; yet, simultaneously, never
have they been under more threat from an awakened humanity.
We have
unprecedented access to information and communication; never have we had
a greater opportunity to transform the world for the better and to
challenge - or make obsolete - the prevailing global power structures.
Yet, simultaneously, never has humanity - collectively
- faced such a
monumental challenge: a combination of a massive global economic crisis,
growing levels of poverty and hunger, tens of millions dying from
poverty-related causes every year, massive global land grabs, high-tech
police states and surveillance societies, murder by remote control drone
terror campaigns, a more distanced decision-making apparatus than
perhaps ever before, and an ecological crisis of such proportions that
it threatens the very survival of the human species, let alone all other
life forms on Earth.
The World of Resistance (WOR) Report is a new Occupy.com series that
aims to provide greater context and understanding about the causes, and
the consequences, of social unrest, protests, riots, resistance,
uprisings, rebellions and revolutions spreading across the globe.
What
form is the "global political awakening" taking in different regions,
under different conditions, and with what differing degrees of success
and failure?
This series aims to explore the evolution of the long road to world
revolution so that we may better understand, and support, the causes of
human and biological survival to ensure that people's "central
challenge" to elites - that is, the quest for "human dignity" - is made
all the more impossible for 1% institutions and ideologies to undermine
or repress.
Part 2
Inequality, Injustice and the Coming Unrest
June 26, 2014
Brzezinski has written and spoken
extensively to elites at American and Western think tanks and
journals, warning that this awakening poses the "central challenge"
for the U.S. and other powerful countries, explaining that,
"most
people know what is generally going on... in the world, and are
consciously aware of global iniquities, inequalities, lack of
respect, exploitation."
Mankind, Brzezinski
said in a 2010 speech,
"is now politically awakened and
stirring."
But Brzezinski is hardly the only figure warning elites and elite
institutions about the characteristics and challenges of an awakened
humanity.
The subject of inequality - raised to the central stage by
the Occupy movement - has become a fundamental feature in the global
social, political and economic discussion, as people become
increasingly aware of the facts underlying the stark division
between the haves and have nots.
While inequality is both a source
and a result of the concentration of power in the hands of a few, it
also represents the greatest threat to those very same power
structures and interests.
As many if not most of us are by now aware, the global
state-capitalist system is run by a relatively small handful of
powerful institutions, groups and individuals who collectively
control the vast majority of planetary wealth and resources.
Banks,
corporations, family dynasties and international financiers like the
IMF and World Bank form a highly interconnected, interdependent
network we now think of as the global oligarchy.
Thomas Pogge explained in the Georgia Journal of International
and Comparative Law that in the 20 years following the end of the
Cold War, there were roughly 360 million preventable poverty-related
deaths - more than all of the deaths in all of the wars of the 20th
century combined.
By 2004, over 1 billion people remained
"chronically undernourished" and nearly a billion lacked access to
clean drinking water and shelter. Roughly 1.6 billion lacked access
to electricity while 218 million children were working as cheap
labour.
Pogge noted that almost half of humanity
- roughly 3.5 billion
people - lived on less than $2.50 a day, and that all of these
people could be lifted out of poverty with an expenditure $500
billion, which is roughly two-thirds of the annual U.S. Pentagon
budget.
Preceding the statistics that would get popularized with the
Occupy movement, Pogge asserted that the top 1% owned approximately
40% of global wealth while the bottom 60% of humanity owned less
than 2%.
"We are now at the point where the
world is easily rich enough in aggregate to abolish all
poverty," Pogge wrote. "We are simply choosing to prioritize
other ends instead."
Still today, every year, approximately 18 million people
- half
of whom are children under the age of five - die from
poverty-related causes, all of which are preventable.
Seen through
this lens, poverty, and by definition, inequality, has become the
greatest purveyor of violence, death and injustice on Earth.
Meanwhile, the international charity Oxfam noted that the 100
richest people in the world made a combined 2012 fortune of $240
billion - enough to lift the worlds poorest out of poverty four
times over.
In the previous 20 years, the worlds richest 1%
increased their income by 60%, perpetuating a system of extreme
wealth which is, according
to an Oxfam executive,
"economically inefficient, politically
corrosive, socially divisive and environmentally destructive."
Not only that, a former chief economist for McKinsey & Company
published data in 2012 for the Tax Justice Network that reported the
worlds super rich had hidden between $21 and $32 trillion in
offshore tax havens - a trend that has been increasing in the past
three decades to reveal that inequality is,
"much,
much worse than official statistics show."
In early 2014, Oxfam released a report revealing that the worlds
85 richest individuals had a combined wealth equal to the collective
wealth of the worlds poorest 3.5 billion people - approximately
$1.7 trillion.
Meanwhile, the worlds top 1% own roughly half the
worlds wealth, at $110 trillion.
Oxfam
noted:
"This massive concentration of
economic resources in the hands of fewer people presents a
significant threat to inclusive political and economic
systems... inevitably heightening social tensions and increasing
the risk of societal breakdown."
What Does All the Inequality Mean in Terms of
Instability?
Where there is great inequality, there is great injustice and
where there is great injustice, there is the inevitability of
instability.
This relationship, between inequality and instability,
has not gone unnoticed by the worlds oligarchs and plutocratic
institutions. The potential for "social unrest" has gotten
especially high since the onset of the global financial and economic
crisis that
began in 2007 and 2008.
The head of the OECD warned
in 2009 that the worlds leading economies would have to take
quick action to resolve the global crisis or face a "fully blown
social crisis with scarring effects on the vulnerable workers and
low-income households."
The major credit ratings agency Moodys warned
back in 2009 that the growing debts among nations would
"test
social cohesiveness" as investors demanded countries impose still
more painful austerity measures, leading to growing "political and
social tension" and "social unrest."
In February of that same year,
the Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) warned that
following the economic crisis, many nations were,
"going to be confronted by unrest
and inter-religious and inter-ethnic conflicts."
Brzezinski himself said,
"Theres going to be growing conflict
between the classes and if people are unemployed and really hurting,
hell, there could even be riots."
And meanwhile, the top-ranking
U.S. military official and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Admiral Mike Mullen, commented that
the global financial crisis was a greater security concern to the
U.S. than either of the massive ground wars in Iraq or Afghanistan.
"Its a global crisis," he said, and
"as that impacts security issues, or feeds greater instability,
I think it will impact our national security in ways that we
quite havent figured out yet."
Mullen's point was reiterated by U.S. intelligence director
Dennis Blair, who warned Congress
that the global crisis was,
"the primary near-term security concern"
for the U.S., adding that "the longer it takes for the recovery to
begin, the greater the likelihood of serious damage to U.S.
strategic interests."
Blair noted that as a result of the crisis,
roughly 25% of the worlds nations had already experienced,
"low-level instability such as government changes." If the crisis
persisted beyond two years, Blair
noted, there was a potential for "regime-threatening
instability."
U.S. intelligence analysts were also
fearful of a "backlash against U.S. efforts to
promote free markets because the crisis was triggered by the United
States."
In November of 2008, the U.S. Army War College produced a
document warning that the U.S. military must be prepared for the
possibility of a,
"violent strategic dislocation inside the United
States," possibly caused by an "unforeseen economic collapse" and/or
a "purposeful domestic resistance" and the "loss of functioning of
political and legal order."
Under "extreme circumstances," the
document warned,
"this might include the use of
military force against hostile groups inside the United States."
In 2009, the British spy agency MI5, along with the British
Ministry of Defence, were preparing for the potential of civil
unrest to explode in Britain's streets as a result of the economic
crisis, [noting]
that there was a possibility the state would deploy British troops
in major cities.
A December 2009 article in The Economist warned that
increased unemployment and poverty along with "exaggerated income
inequalities" following the global economic crisis made for a "brew
that foments unrest."
In October of 2011, the International Labour
Organization
warned
in a major report that the jobs crisis resulting from the global
economic crisis "threatens a wave of widespread social unrest
engulfing both rich and poor countries," and pointed out that 45 of
the 118 countries studied already saw rising risks of unrest,
notably in the E.U., Arab world and Asia.
In June of 2013, the same ILO warned that
the risks of social unrest including "strikes, work stoppages,
street protests and demonstrations," had increased in most countries
around the world since
the economic crisis began in 2008.
The risk
was "highest among the E.U.-27 countries," it noted, with an
increase from 34% in 2006-2007 to 46% in 2011-2012.
The most
vulnerable nations in the E.U. were listed as Cyprus, Czech
Republic, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain, a fact,
"likely due to the policy responses
to the ongoing sovereign debt crisis and their impact on
peoples lives and perceptions of well-being."
The E.U.s,
"bleak economic scenario has created a fragile social
environment as fewer people see opportunities for obtaining a good
job and improving their standard of living," warned
the ILO, and advanced economies were "going to suffer a
lost decade of jobs growth."
An October 2013 report by
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
warned that the long-term consequences of austerity policies imposed
by E.U. governments,
"will be felt for decades even if the economy
turns for the better in the near future."
The report noted:
"We see quiet desperation spreading
among Europeans, resulting in depression, resignation and loss
of hope... Many from the middle class have spiraled down to
poverty."
The study further reported,
"that the rate at which unemployment
figures have risen in the past 24 months alone is an indication
that the crisis is deepening, with severe personal costs as a
consequence, and possible unrest and extremism as a risk.
Combined with increasing living costs, this is a dangerous
combination."
In November 2013, The
Economist reported:
"From anti-austerity movements to
middle-class revolts, in rich countries and in poor, social unrest
has been on the rise around the world."
While there are various
triggers - from economic distress (Greece and Spain) to revolts
against dictatorships (the Arab Spring) to the growing aspirations
of middle class populations (Turkey and Brazil),
"they share some
underlying features," the magazine reported.
The common feature, it
noted,
"is the 2008-09 financial crisis and its aftermath," and an
especially important factor sparking unrest in recent years was "an
erosion of trust in governments and institutions: a crisis of
democracy."
A sister company of The Economist, the Economist Intelligence
Unit (EIU), measured the risk of social unrest in 150 countries
around the world, with an emphasis on countries with institutional
and political weaknesses.
The EIU
noted that,
"recent developments have indeed revealed a deep
sense of popular dissatisfaction with political elites and
institutions in many emerging markets."
Indeed, the decline in trust
has been accelerating across the developed world since the 1970s.
The fall of Communist East European regimes in 1989 eroded that
trust further, and the process sped up once again with the onset of
the global financial crisis.
According to EIU estimates, roughly 43% (or 65) of the countries
studied were considered to be at "high" or "very high" risk of
social unrest in 2014. A further 54 countries were considered to be
at "medium risk" and the remaining 31 were considered "low" or "very
low."
Comparing the results to a similar study published five years
previously, an additional 19 countries have been added to the "high
risk" category.
Among the countries
considered a "very high risk" for social unrest in 2014 were,
-
Argentina
-
Bahrain
-
Bangladesh
-
Bosnia
-
Egypt
-
Greece
-
Lebanon
-
Nigeria
-
Syria
-
Uzbekistan
-
Venezuela
-
Yemen
-
Zimbabwe
Among the
countries in the "high risk" category were,
-
Algeria
-
Brazil
-
Cambodia
-
China
-
Cyprus
-
Ethiopia
-
Guatemala
-
Haiti
-
Honduras
-
Iran
-
Jordan
-
Laos
-
Mexico
-
Morocco
-
Nicaragua
-
Pakistan
-
Peru
-
the
Philippines
-
Portugal
-
South Africa
-
Spain
-
Tunisia
-
Turkmenistan
-
Turkey
-
Ukraine
It doesn't take demonstrators filling the streets to tell us that
inequality breeds instability.
While many factors combine under
different circumstances to lead to "social unrest," inequality is
almost always a common feature. Injustice, poor governance,
corruption, poverty, exploitation, repression and corrosive power
structures all support and are supported by underlying conditions of
inequality.
And as inequality is no longer a local, national or
regional phenomenon but a global one, so too is the "threat" of
instability that the world's elite financial, media and think-tank
institutions are now so busy warning about. So long as inequality
increases, so will instability.
Resistance, and even revolution, are
the new global reality.
Part 3
Davos Class Jittery Amid Growing
Warnings of Global Unrest
July 04, 2014
As an annual gathering of thousands of leading financial, corporate,
political and social oligarchs in Davos, Switzerland, the World
Economic Forum (WEF) has taken a keen interest in recent years
discussing the potential for social upheaval as a result of mass
inequality and poverty.
A WEF
report released in November of 2013 warned that a "lost
generation" of unemployed youth in Europe could potentially pull the
Eurozone apart.
One of the report's authors, the CEO of Infosys,
commented that,
"unless we address chronic joblessness we will see an
escalation in social unrest," noting that youth especially "need to
be productively employed, or we will witness rising crime rates,
stagnating economies and the deterioration of our social fabric."
The report added:
"A generation that starts its career
in complete hopelessness will be more prone to populist politics
and will lack the fundamental skills that one develops early on
in their career."
In short, if the global ruling class - known affectionately as
the Davos Class - doesn't quickly find ways to accommodate the
continent's increasingly unemployed and "lost" youth, those people
will potentially turn to "populist politics" of resistance that
directly challenge the global political and economic order.
For the
individuals and interests represented at the World Social Forum,
this poses a monumental and, increasingly, an
existential threat.
The World Economic Forums Global Competitiveness Report for
2013-2014, entitled "Assessing the Sustainable Competitiveness of
Nations," noted that the global financial crisis and its aftermath "brought social tensions to light" as economic growth was not
translated into positive benefits for much or most of the planet's
population.
Citing the Arab Spring, growing unemployment in Western
economies and increasing income inequality, there was growing
recognition that dangerous upheaval could be on the way.
The report
noted:
"Diminishing economic prospects,
sometimes combined with demand for more political participation,
have also sparked protests in several countries including, for
example, the recent events in Brazil and Turkey."
The WEF report wrote that,
"if economic benefits are perceived to
be unevenly redistributed within a society," this could frequently
result in "riots or social discontent" such as the Arab Spring
revolts, protests in Brazil, the Occupy Wall Street movement, and
other recent examples.
The report concluded that numerous nations
were at especially high risk of social unrest, including China,
Indonesia, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil, India, Peru and Russia,
among others.
In early 2014, the World Economic Forum released the 9th edition
of its Global Risks report, published to inform the debate,
discussion and planning of attendees and guests at the annual WEF
meeting in Davos.
The report was produced with the active
cooperation of major universities and financial corporations,
including Marsh & McLennan Companies, Swiss Re, Zurich Insurance
Group, National University of Singapore, University of Oxford, and
the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton Risk Management and
Decision Processes Center.
It included a large survey conducted in
an effort to assess the major perceived risks to the global order
atop which the Davos Class sits.
The report noted that the "most interconnected" risks were fiscal
crises, structural unemployment and underemployment, all of which
link to "rising income inequality and political and social
instability."
The young generation now coming of age globally, noted
the WEF, "faces high unemployment and precarious job situations,
hampering their efforts to build a future and raising the risk of
social unrest." This "lost generation" faces not only high
unemployment and underemployment, but also major educational
challenges since,
"traditional higher education is
ever more expensive and its payoff more doubtful."
Perceiving the innovations and skills of today's generation which
are enabling the growing foment, the Forum noted:
"In general, the mentality of this generation is realistic,
adaptive and versatile.
Smart technology and social media
provide new ways to quickly connect, build communities, voice
opinion and exert political pressure... [youth are] full of
ambition to make the world a better place, yet feel disconnected
from traditional politics and government - a combination which
presents both a challenge and an opportunity in addressing
global risks."
The Global Risks 2014 report cited a global opinion survey on the,
"awareness, priorities and values of global youth," which the
authors refer to as "generation lost."
This generation, noted the
survey,
"think independently of this basic fallback system of the
older generation - governments providing a safety net," which "points to a wider distrust of authorities and institutions."
The "mindset" of today's youth has been additionally shaped by the
repercussions and apparent failures to deal with the global
financial crisis, as well as increasing revelations about U.S.
intelligence agencies engaging in massive digital spying.
For a
generation largely mobilized through social media, online spying has
held particular relevance, as,
"the digital revolution gave them
unprecedented access to knowledge and information worldwide."
Protests and anti-austerity movements were able to,
"give voice to
an increasing distrust in current socio-economic and political
systems," with youth making up significant portions of "the general
disappointment felt in many nations with regional and global
governance bodies such as the EU and the International Monetary
Fund."
The youth,
"place less importance on traditionally organized
political parties and leadership," which creates a major "challenge
for those in positions of authority in existing institutions" as
they try "to find ways to engage the young generation," adds the
report.
According to the World Bank, more than 25% of the worlds youth,
or some 300 million people, "have no productive work."
On top of
this,
"an unprecedented demographic youth bulge is bringing more
than 120 million new young people on to the job market each year,
mostly in the developing world."
This fact,
"threatens to halt
economic progress, creating a vicious cycle of less economic
activity and more unemployment," which "raises the risk of social
unrest by creating a disaffected lost generation who are
vulnerable to being sucked into criminal or extremist
movements."
Noting that more than 1 billion people currently live in slums
- a number that has been steadily increasing as income inequality
rises - the report stated that
"this growing population of urban
poor is vulnerable to rising food prices and economic crises, posing
significant risks of chronic social instability."
Growing income
inequality is now being termed a "systemic risk," according to the
WEF.
And in a stark admission from that institution representing the
worlds major profiteers of global capitalism, the report
acknowledged that globalization ,
has been associated with rising
inequality between and within countries" and that "these factors
render poor people and poor countries vulnerable to systemic
risks."
The four major "emerging market" BRIC nations of Brazil, Russia,
India and China,
"now rank among the 10 largest economies worldwide."
But slow political reforms within these countries, coupled with
external economic shocks (like financial crises caused by Western
nations and their corporate institutions) could aggravate the "existing undertones of social unrest."
Within the BRIC nations and
other emerging market economies,
"popular discontent with the status
quo is already apparent among rising middle classes, digitally
connected youths and marginalized groups," the report went on.
Collectively, these groups,
"want better services (such as
healthcare), infrastructure, employment and working conditions," as
well as "greater accountability of public officials, better
protected civil liberties and more equitable judicial systems."
Further, a,
"greater public awareness of
widespread corruption have sharpened popular complaints."
Both Brazil and Turkey have made universal healthcare systems a
constitutional obligation, which was a stated ambition of other
emerging market nations such as India, Indonesia and South Africa.
The failure to create these healthcare systems
"may arouse social
unrest," warned the WEF.
The World Economic Forums chief economist,
Jennifer Blanke, stated:
"The message from the Arab Spring, and from
countries such as Brazil and South Africa is that people are not
going to stand for it any more."
David Cole, the group chief risk
officer of Swiss Re (one of the contributing companies to the WEF
report) commented:
"The members of generation lost are not lost
because they have tuned out. They are highly tuned in. They are lost
because they are being left out or they are deciding to leave."
http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/16/income-gap-biggest-risk-global-community-world-economic-forum
The World Economic Forums Risk report for 2014 was primarily
concerned with "the breakdown of social structures" and "the decline
of trust in institutions."
It warned of risks of,
"ideological
polarization, extremism - in particular those of a religious or
political nature - and intra-state conflicts such as civil wars."
All of these issues relate directly "to
the future of the youth."
Its an interesting paradox for an organization to see the
greatest threat to its ideological and social power being "the
future of the youth" when it has already written off the present
generation as "lost."
However, this is a view shared not only by the
World Economic Forum but, increasingly, by other powerful
institutions creating something of an echo chamber through the
mainstream media.
The head of the IMF has warned that youth
unemployment in poor nations was "a kind of time bomb," and the head
of the International Labor Organization (ILO) warned in 2011 that
the,
"world economy" was unable "to secure a future for all youth,"
thus undermining "families, social cohesion and the credibility of
policies."
While there was,
"already revolution in the air in some
countries," as
reported in the Globe and Mail, the dual crises of unemployment
and poverty were "fuel for the fire."
In April of 2014, the World Economic Forum on Latin America
reported that the primary challenge for the region was "to reduce
inequality," noting that between 70 and 90 million people in Latin
America had entered what were referred to as the "consuming
classes," or "middle classes," over the previous decade.
However,
Marcelo Cortes Neri, Brazils Minister of Strategic Affairs,
explained,
"When we talk about middle class we
think of the U.S. middle class, with two cars and two dogs and a
swimming pool. That is not Latin American middle class or the
world middle class."
He added that the emerging so-called "middle class" in Latin
America and elsewhere,
"could become a problem for governance,"
commenting: "They are the ones that put pressure for better levels
of education and healthcare; they are the ones that go to the
streets to demand rights."
Neri then posed the question:
"How
prepared is Latin America to have a robust middle class?"
In
particular, youth between the ages of 15 and 29 raised specific
concerns for Latin Americas elite, with Neri
warning:
"This is the group I am most worried
about. They have very high expectations and so the probability
they will get frustrated is enormous."
When one of the worlds most influential organizations
representing the collective interests of the global oligarchy openly
acknowledges that globalization has increased inequality, and in
turn, that inequality is fueling social unrest around the world
manifesting the greatest potential threat to those oligarchic
interests, we can safely say we're entering a new era of global
instability and resistance.
Part 4
Financial Institutions Fear
Global Revolution
July 11, 2014
In November of 2011, Bob Diamond, the CEO of one of the worlds
largest banks, Barclays, stated
in a speech:
"Weve seen violent protests in Greece, public
sector strikes across Europe, [and] anti-capitalist demonstrations
that started on Wall Street have spread to other places around the
world."
Diamond added:
"Young people have been especially
hit hard by high levels of unemployment. The threat of further
social unrest remains if we dont work together to generate
stronger economic growth and more jobs."
A March 2013 report by senior economic
adviser George Magnus of UBS Investment Research, entitled "Social
Unrest and Economic Stress - Europes Angst, and Chinas Fear" noted
that,
"the wave of social unrest that rumbled across Europe between
2008 and 2011 has become less intense... [and] has come as a cause
for relief in financial markets."
Yet, he wrote, the occasional
upsurge in large-scale national and European-wide anti-austerity
protests and strikes,
"signifies the deep malaise in the complex and
fragile trust relationship between European citizens and their
governments and institutions."
Since 2010, approximately 13 out of
19 E.U. governments had been voted out of office or had collapsed,
indicating that,
"public anger... is far from
dormant, and its expression is mostly unpredictable."
Social unrest, added the UBS report,
"is a systemic phenomenon"
that is "highly uncertain, complex and ambiguous," and which can
lead "to the toppling of governments, or even political systems."
Social unrest across the E.U.
"has been notable more for the public
expression of lack of trust in the institutions of government,
including in Brussels," the headquarters of the European Union.
This "lull" in social unrest, warned Magnus,
"is most likely
deceptive."
The present problem in Europe "is the same" as the main
problems in Europe of the 1930s - when mass poverty, unemployment
and social unrest led to the rise of fascism.
The underlying problem
in both eras was,
"the inadequacy of mainstream,
political channels to address rising public concern about the
loss of economic security, social stability and, yes, cultural
identity."
Citing an OECD study, the bank report noted that,
"austerity has
gone hand-in-hand with a variety of forms of social and political
instability, and politically-motivated violence."
There have been,
"heightened levels of social unrest and shocks to the political
system in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy... sometimes requiring
the force of the state to suppress it."
These are especially
important matters for banks to pay attention to, since the European
debt crisis was caused primarily by the big banks - and the
austerity and "structural reform" policies (along with the bailouts
that accompanied them) were designed for the benefit of those banks
as well.
Thus, resistance to austerity and "reform" is, in effect,
resistance to the bailouts for the big banks.
In May of 2013, JPMorgan Chase released a report,
"The Euro Area
Adjustment: About Halfway There," which assessed "progress" in the
European Union on the issue of austerity and structural reform.
The "adjustment" of European society, claimed the report, was
"about
halfway done on average," noting that the process would continue for
much of the rest of the decade although it faced major challenges,
including the development of "new institutions" in the E.U. and what
the bank called "national legacy problems."
This vague term referred
to,
"the constitutions and political
settlements in the southern periphery [of the E.U.], put in
place in the aftermath of the fall of fascism, [which] have a
number of features which appear to be unsuited to further
integration in the region."
Just what does this mean?
The bank explained that "fiscal
austerity" was likely to be a major feature in the E.U. "for a very
extended period."
However, if the European Monetary Union is to
survive the coming decade, "deep seated political problems in the
periphery... need to change." But what precisely are these "deep
seated problems"?
The bank elaborated that many of the southern
periphery states constitutions "tend to show a strong socialist
influence," referring to the fact that many constitutions guaranteed
various social rights for populations, including labor, healthcare
and educational and civil rights.
Further, the bank reported that many of these nations suffer from
the following features:
"Weak executives; weak central states
relative to regions; constitutional protection of labor rights;
consensus building systems... and the right to protest if unwelcome
changes are made to the political status quo."
The translation:
democracy itself is the problem. As such, JPMorgan noted,
"the
process of political reform has barely begun."
In other words, out
with democracy and in with financial and corporate oligarchy.
The banks report also noted that there were a number of
potential threats as the process of "political reform" advanced,
including,
"the collapse of several reform minded governments in the
European south," a "collapse in support for the Euro or the E.U.,"
the possibility of "an outright electoral victory for radical
anti-European parties," or perhaps even "the effective
ungovernability of some Member States once social costs
(particularly unemployment) pass a particular level."
JPMorgan Chase
warned that while there wasnt a current situation of "ungovernability" in E.U. states, the longer-term prospects were,
"hard to predict, and a more
pronounced backlash to the current approach to crisis management
cannot be excluded."
AXA, one of the worlds largest financial institutions and
insurance companies, published a report in July of 2013 written by
Manolis Davradakis, entitled "Emerging Unrest: Looking for a
Pattern," which expressed particular concerns and perspectives on
the issue of social unrest.
The report noted that emerging market
economies,
"are currently experiencing a surge
in political risk due to social unrest that is being fueled by
reasons that differ from those that resulted in the Arab
Spring."
The "main cause" of unrest in emerging market nations was,
"the
rise of the middle class," as this portion of the population "realize that they continue to experience the same everyday problems
as poorer population strata, namely a high crime rate, poor public
services, and corruption."
The report cited examples of social
unrest in Turkey and Brazil, warning that these countries could see
their credit ratings cut if the social upheaval is "lasting."
The AXA report referred to the multiple episodes of unrest across
emerging market nations in the summer of 2013 as "riots," stating
that they had several points in common, namely that,
"they were
sparked by a government decision affecting daily life" and that the
protesters were "not affiliated with political parties or movements"
but instead were "well educated members of the middle class."
These
factors were reminiscent of the massive unrest that took place in
the advanced economies during the 19th century when emerging middle
classes were struggling,
"for better living standards and
more representation in political governance."
Beyond a certain point, warned AXA,
"repressing mass demands for
a more open society becomes costly and economically ineffective."
A
governments inability or lack of will,
"to acknowledge the peoples right
to freedom of expression and a voice in decision-making is a
source of social unrest."
AXA devised a Poor Governance Index (PGI), analyzing seven key
indicators that could lead to social unrest, and concluded that the
potential for instability in
the BRIC nations
- Brazil, Russia,
India and China - was quite high.
It also cited increased potential
for unrest in Egypt, Ukraine, Indonesia, South Africa, Tunisia and
Turkey, warning that such unrest,
"may have implications for emerging
market [credit] ratings."
It noted that several credit ratings
agencies had already warned about the effects that "prolonged social
unrest" could have on the ratings for Turkey and Brazil.
Going further, in July of 2013, Stephen D. King, chief economist
of HSBC bank, warned that growing wealth gaps and increasing
divisions between generations could result in youth uprisings
similar to the Peasants Revolt of the Middle Ages.
King commented:
"I am intrigued at the moment that
the youth are quite peaceful, and I wonder whether that might
change. It is very difficult to predict but youth movements
might become more focused on their own rights rather than the
economy."
In October of 2013, King wrote
an op-ed for the New York Times in which he warned that as bad
as things already were,
"they are going to get much worse, for the
United States and other advanced economies, in the years ahead,"
writing that both sides of the North Atlantic region had "already
succumbed to a Japan-style lost decade" in which "promises can no
longer be met, mistrust spreads and markets malfunction."
King wrote
that,
"facing the pain will not be easy," especially as policy makers
continue to "opt for the illusion" and "pray for a strong
recovery... because the reality is too bleak to bear."
The "bleak" reality is that these and other big banks and
financial institutions have repeatedly collapsed the global economy
and profited along the way, punishing entire societies and
populations into poverty through a process of plundering and
exploitation as governments feared the wrath of "financial markets."
The banks that are now bigger, more dangerous and more powerful than
ever fear the growing discontent, unrest and resistance of
populations - especially the youth.
The worlds major financial
institutions fear that the global economic system which they helped
to create, and over which they rule, will ultimately come back to
haunt them in the form of mass social unrest, potentially
undermining their power and the system as a whole.
Part 5
IMF, World Bank, Giant
Consultants Admit The Storm Is Coming
July 18, 2014
These two groups - financial institutions and the consultants that
advise them - play key roles in the spread of institutionalized
corporate and financial power, and as such, warnings from these
groups about the threat posed by "social unrest" carry particular
weight as they are geared toward a particular audience: the global
oligarchy itself.
Organizations like the International
Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank were responsible for forcing neoliberal
economic "restructuring" on much of the developing world from the
1980s onwards, as the IMF and E.U. are currently imposing on Greece
and large parts of Europe.
The results have been and continue to be
devastating for populations, while corporations and banks accumulate
unprecedented wealth and power.
As IMF austerity programs spread across the globe, poverty
followed, and so too did protests and rebellion.
Between 1976 and
1992, there were 146 protests against IMF-sponsored programs in 39
different countries around the world, often resulting in violent
state repression of the domestic populations (cited explicitly by Firoze Manji and Carl OCoill in
"The Missionary Position: NGOs and
Development in Africa," International Affairs, Vol. 78, No. 3,
2002).
These same programs by the IMF and World Bank facilitated the
massive growth of slums, as the policies demanded by the
organizations forced countries to undertake massive layoffs,
privatization, deregulation, austerity and the liberalization of
markets - amounting, ultimately, to a new system of social genocide.
The new poor and displaced rural communities flocked to cities in
search of work and hope for a better future, only to be herded into
massive urban shantytowns and slums.
Today roughly one in seven people on
Earth, or over 1 billion, live in slums (an excellent
source on this is Mike Davis's "Planet
of Slums".)
How the Big Institutions Have Operated
Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning former chief economist
at the World Bank, blew the whistle on the World Bank's and IMF's
policies in countries around the world - an act for which he was
ultimately fired.
In
an interview with Greg Palast for the Guardian in 2001, Stiglitz
explained that the same four steps of market liberalization are
applied to every country.
The first includes privatization of state-owned industries and
assets.
The second step is capital market liberalization, which,
"allows investment capital to flow in and out," though as he put it,
"the money often simply flows out."
As
Stiglitz explained, speculative cash flows into countries, and
when there are signs of trouble it flows out dramatically in a
matter of days, at which point the IMF demands the countries raise
interest rates as high as 30% to 80%, further wrecking the economy.
At this point comes step three, called "market-based pricing," in
which prices get raised on food, water and cooking gas, leading to
what Stiglitz calls "Step-Three-and-a-Half: the IMF riot."
When a
nation is,
"down and out, [the IMF] squeezes the last drop of blood
out of them. They turn up the heat until, finally, the whole
cauldron blows up."
This process is always anticipated by the IMF
and World Bank, which have even noted in various internal documents
that their programs for countries could be expected to spark "social
unrest."
And finally comes step four, "free trade," meaning that highly
protectionist trade rules go into effect under supervision of the
World Bank and World Trade Organization.
Expecting Riots
The term "IMF riots" was applied to dozens of nations around the
world that experienced waves of protests in response to the
IMF/World Bank programs of the 1980s and 1990s, which plunged them
into crisis through austerity measures, privatization and
deregulation all enforced under so-called "structural adjustment
programs."
As the
Guardian noted in September of 2012,
"the European governments
are out-IMF-ing the IMF in its austerity drive so much that now the
fund itself frequently issues the warning that Europe is going too
far, too fast."
Thus, we saw "IMF riots" - protests against
austerity and structural adjustment measures - erupting over the
past three years in Greece, Spain, Portugal and elsewhere in the E.U.
An academic
study published in August of 2011 by Jacopo Ponticelli and
Hans-Joachim Voth examined the link between austerity and social
unrest, analyzing 28 European countries between 1919 and 2009, and
11 Latin American countries since 1937.
The researchers measured
levels of social unrest looking at five major indicators: riots,
anti-government protests, general strikes, political assassinations
and attempted revolutions.
The verdict:
The researchers found there was "a clear and
positive statistical association between expenditure cuts and the
level of unrest."
In other words, the more that austerity was
imposed, the more unrest resulted. Spending cuts, they wrote,
"create the risk of major social and
political instability."
The Eurozone has been referred to by some as,
"an unemployment
torture chamber" due to the structural reforms to the labor market - enforced through bailout conditions
- which were purportedly
designed to make it easier for employers to hire and fire but,
instead, "firing has utterly dominated the employers agendas,"
according to the Globe and Mail.
This has created a "lost
generation" in which unemployment in the E.U. for youths between 16
and 24 amounts to roughly 25% - while in Italy it's roughly 40% and
for Greece and Spain its as high as 60%.
Tom Rogers, an adviser to
Ernst & Young, noted,
"Youth joblessness at these levels
risks permanently entrenched unemployment, lowering the rate of
sustainable growth in the future."
The head of the IMF, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, warned
in 2008 that,
"social unrest may happen in many places, including
advanced economies."
The head of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, warned
in 2009 that,
"If we do not take measures, there
is a risk of a serious human and social crisis with very serious
political implications."
Additionally, in November of 2009, the IMF
chief warned the premier British corporate lobbying group, the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI), that if a second major
bailout of the banks were to occur, democracy itself would be
jeopardized.
The "man on the street" would not accept further
bailouts, Strauss-Kahn said, and "the political reaction will be
very strong, putting some democracies at risk."
Consulting in the Midst of a Crisis
Global consulting firms play a peculiar role in the global
economic order.
The consulting, or "strategy," firms became
commonplace in the 1960s onward, and were frequently
seen as "home to some great minds in the corporate world," hired
by corporate, financial and other institutional clients to advise
management on strategy and investments.
The
Financial Times referred to the industry as,
"a global behemoth,
employing an estimated 3 million people and generating revenues of
$300 billion a year," with the industrys "product" being "the
knowledge vested in its people."
According to an Oxford team of researchers, in 2011 consulting
firms advised on more than $13 trillion of U.S. institutional money.
Worldwide, consultants advised roughly $25 trillion worth of assets.
Consulting advice was seen to be "highly influential" in the United
States; yet despite the enormous power wielded by consultancy firms,
the Oxford
study found that the funds recommended to investors by
consultants did not in the end perform better than other funds.
Still, the influence of giant consulting firms remains, although
their reputations have taken some hits along the way.
The worlds
largest consulting firms at the end of 2013 were McKinsey &
Company, Bain & Company, Boston Consulting Group, Booz & Company,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Oliver Wyman, Deloitte Consulting, The
Parthenon Group, A.T. Kearney and Accenture.
With these large firms
advising even larger clients on strategy and investments, it's worth
examining some of the advice and perspectives published by these
agencies.
For example, McKinsey & Company, the worlds largest global
management consulting firm, published a report in 2012 (Dominic
Barton, "Capitalism for the Long Term," Autumn 2012) noting that in
the previous few years the world had been witnessing,
"a dramatic acceleration in the
shifting balance of power between the developed West and the
emerging East, a rise in populist politics and social stresses
in a number of countries, and significant strains on global
governance systems."
For corporate executives,
"the most consequential outcome of the
[economic] crisis is the challenge to capitalism itself."
And while,
"trust in business hit historically low levels more than a decade
ago," McKinsey warned, "the crisis and the surge in public
antagonism it unleashed have exacerbated the friction between
business and society," adding to anxiety over rising income
inequality and other factors.
Having interviewed over 400 business and government leaders
around the world, the McKinsey report noted that,
"despite a certain
amount of frustration on each side, the two groups share the belief
that capitalism has been and can continue to be the greatest engine
of prosperity ever devised."
However, the report warned,
"there is
growing concern that if the fundamental issues revealed in the
crisis remain unaddressed and the system fails again, the social
contract between the capitalist system and the citizenry may truly
rupture, with unpredictable but severely damaging results."
McKinsey
& Company thus called for,
"nothing less than a shift from...
quarterly capitalism to what might be referred to as long-term
capitalism."
In another instance, KPMG, one of the worlds leading accountancy
firms and professional service providers, published a report in 2013
examining a list of "megatrends" in the world leading up to the year
2030 ("Future State 2030: The Global Megatrends Shaping
Governments," KPMG International, 2013).
One of the major trends it
referred to was,
"the rise of the individual," in which technological
and educational advancements "have helped empower individuals like
never before, leading to increased demands for transparency and
participation in government and public decision-making."
This process is "ushering in a new era in human history," KPMG
went on.
With major social issues left unresolved such as growing
inequality and access to education, services, employment and
healthcare,
"growing individual empowerment will
present numerous challenges to government structures and
processes, but if harnessed, could unleash significant economic
development and social advancement."
The report further warned that there were other major
consequences with the,
"rise of the individual," including
"rising
expectations" and increased "income inequality within countries
leading to potential for greater social unrest."
The fact that
populations are,
"increasingly connected" and "faster dissemination
of information through social media accelerates action" posed other
concerns.
John Herhalt, a former partner at KPMG, was quoted in the
report as saying,
"Citizens are not just demanding
technologically advanced interactions with government, but also
asking for a new voice."
Further, a 2013 survey of 1,300 CEOs from 68 countries by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, another of the world's largest consulting
firms, reported general views shared by CEOs around the world
("Dealing With Disruption: Adapting to Survive and Thrive," 16th
Annual Global CEO Survey).
When asked about the ability of firms to
deal with the potential impact of disruptive scenarios, the vast
majority (75%) of CEOs responded that their companies,
"would be
negatively affected, with major social unrest being cause for the
greatest concern."
This was perceived as a greater threat than an
economic slowdown in China.
CEOs, noted the report,
"know theyll have to repair the bridges
of trust between business and society," as the global financial
crisis and its aftermath "have badly damaged faith in institutions
of every kind."
Due to the revolution in social media,
it concluded, many new,
"stakeholders... have an
unprecedented amount of clout."
After in-depth analyses of documents, speeches and reports from
the worlds major economic institutions - from international
organizations like the World Bank and IMF to global consultancy
firms like McKinsey & Company and PricewaterhouseCoopers; and from
big banks like HSBC, JPMorgan Chase and UBS to oligarchic platforms
like the World Economic Forum - three issues are prevalent in terms
of assessing the fears and threats facing the global elite:
-
growing inequality
-
decline of public trust in institutions of
all kinds
-
the resulting social unrest
It should be clear by now that as global inequality continues to
rise, trust in institutions will continue to fall, and social unrest
will explode in new and more dramatic ways than we have witnessed
thus far.
We truly are entering a World of Resistance.
