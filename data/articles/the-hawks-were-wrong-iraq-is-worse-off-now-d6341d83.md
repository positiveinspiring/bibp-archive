Saddam is gone... but at what cost?

On Saturday 15 February 2003, more than a
million of us - students, toddlers, Christians, Muslims, nuns, Telegraph
readers - gathered in Hyde Park for the biggest public demonstration in
British history.
Not in my name, we chanted, as a series of
speakers - from Charles Kennedy to Jesse Jackson - lined up to denounce the
impending invasion of Iraq.
In Glasgow, a sombre yet defiant prime minister delivered a speech to Labour
Party activists.
Responding to the march in London, Tony Blair declaimed:
The moral case against war has a moral
answer: it is the moral case for removing Saddam.
He continued,
It is not the reason we act. That must be
according to the United Nations mandate on weapons of mass destruction.
But it is the reason, frankly, why if we do have to act, we should do so
with a clear conscience.
Whether or not Blairs conscience remains
clear is, as he once pointed out, between him and God.
But a decade on from the debate about dodgy
dossiers, WMDs, 45-minute warnings and various clauses and sub-clauses of
UN
Resolution 1441, those of us who marched against the war stand vindicated.
We were right; the hawks were wrong...
It isnt the size of our demonstration that those of us against the war
should be proud of, it is our judgment. Our arguments and predictions
turned out to be correct and those of our belligerent opponents were
discredited.
Remember the rhetoric?
-
There was no doubt that the invaders
would find the clearest possible evidence of Saddams weapons of
mass destruction (Blair) as well as evidence of how Iraq had
provided training in these weapons [of mass destruction] to
al-Qaeda (Colin Powell)
-
The foreign troops would be greeted as
liberators (Dick Cheney)
-
The establishment of a free Iraq at the
heart of the Middle East would be a watershed event in the global
democratic revolution (George W Bush).
It was a farrago of lies and half-truths, of
delusion and doublethink.
Aside from the viewers of Fox News, most people
are now aware that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, no
ties between secular Saddam and Islamist Osama. The fall of the Baathist
dictatorship failed to usher in a democratic or human-rights revolution.
Every argument advanced by the hawks proved to be utterly false.
The Iraq war was a strategic disaster - or, as the Tory minister Kenneth
Clarke put it in a recent BBC radio discussion,
the most disastrous foreign policy
decision of my lifetime... worse than Suez.
The invasion and occupation of the country,
-
undermined the moral standing of the
western powers
-
empowered Iran and its proxies
-
heightened the threat from al-Qaeda at
home and abroad
-
sent a clear signal to rogue regimes
that the best (the only?) means of deterring a pre-emptive US-led
attack, was to acquire weapons of mass destruction (see Korea, North)
There may have been a strong moral case for
toppling the tyrant and liberating the Iraqi people - but there was a much
stronger moral case against doing so.
Brutal and vicious as
Saddams reign had been, a
humanitarian intervention could not just be justified in March 2003, given
the complete absence of an ongoing or imminent mass slaughter of Iraqis.
Some of us warned that the cost of action, in blood and treasure, would far
outweigh the cost of inaction.
And so it came to pass.
The greatest weapon of mass destruction turned
out to be the invasion itself.
Over the past ten years, Iraqis have witnessed
the physical, social and economic destruction of their country:
-
the aerial demolition of schools, homes
and hospitals
-
the siege of cities such as Fallujah
-
US-led massacres at Haditha, Mahmudiyah
and Balad
-
the biggest refugee crisis in the Middle
East since the ethnic cleansing of Palestine in 1948
Between 2003 and 2006, according to a
peer-reviewed study in the Lancet medical journal, 601,000 more people died
in Iraq as a result of violence - that is, bombed, burned, stabbed, shot and
tortured to death - than would have died had the invasion not happened.
Proportionately, that is the equivalent of 1.2
million Britons, or six million Americans, being killed over the same
period. In a typically defensive (and deceptive) passage in his memoirs,
Blair described the Lancet report as extensively challenged and said its
figures were charged with being inaccurate and misleading.
Sir Roy Anderson, the then chief
scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence, told ministers in an internal
memo that its methods were close to best practice and the study design
was robust.
Presumably, denialism is how hawks sleep at night.
They dispute the studies that have uncovered the
human cost of the war - whether it be the civilian casualties across the
country, or the torture and abuse inside Iraqs prisons (which a UN
investigator described in 2006 as worse than it has been in the times of
Saddam Hussein), or the fivefold increase in birth defects and fourfold
increase in cancers in and around Fallujah.
Or they try to blame the violence and turmoil in
Iraq exclusively on terrorists, jihadists and Islamofascists. Few would
dispute that most of the killings in Iraq have been carried out by the
sadistic monsters who fight for al-Qaeda and its affiliates.
But to focus only on the crimes of AQI (or
al-Qaeda in Iraq) represents a gross moral evasion.
-
First, according to the Lancet survey,
31 per cent of the excess deaths in Iraq can be attributed to
coalition forces - about 186,000 people between 2003 and 2006.
-
Second, most studies show that only a
minority of Iraqi insurgents were card-carrying members of AQI. The
insurgency kicked off in Fallujah on 28 April 2003 as a nationalist
campaign, long before the arrival of foreign jihadists but only
after US troops opened fire on, and killed, 17 unarmed Iraqi
protesters.
-
Third, there were no jihadists operating
in Iraq before our Mesopotamian misadventure; Iraq had no history of
suicide bombings. Between 2003 and 2008, however, 1,100 suicide
bombers blew themselves up inside the country
The war made Iraq, in the approving words of the
US general Ricardo Sanchez,
a terrorist magnet... a target of
opportunity.
The Iraq invasion turned out to be the best
recruiting sergeant that Muslim extremists could ever have prayed for,
radicalizing thousands of young men from the Middle East to the Midlands.
Listen to the verdict of the former head of MI5,
Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller:
Whatever the merits of putting an end to
Saddam Hussein, the war was also a distraction from the pursuit of
al-Qaeda. It increased the terrorist threat... [and] spurred some
British Muslims to turn to terror.
Ultimately, say some hawks, such arguments are
irrelevant.
Didnt Iraqis welcome the removal of Saddam?
Despite the bloodshed, isnt their nation better off as a result of the war?
Not quite.
Let me clear it up for any moron with
lingering doubts, wrote the Iraqi blogger known by the pseudonym
Riverbend on her blog Baghdad Burning in February 2007.
Its worse. Its over. You lost... You lost
every sane, red-blooded Iraqi when the Abu Ghraib pictures came out...
You lost when you brought murderers, looters, gangsters and militia
heads to power...
In September 2011, a Zogby poll found that 42
per cent of Iraqis thought they were worse off as a result of the
Anglo-American invasion of their country, compared to only 30 per cent of
Iraqis who said better off.
An earlier poll, conducted for the BBC in
November 2005, found a slim majority of Iraqis (50.3 per cent) saying the
Iraq war was somewhat or absolutely wrong.
Should we be surprised?
The post-Saddam government, observes the noted
Iraqi novelist and activist Haifa Zangana, is,
consumed by sectarian, ethnic division, but
above all by corruption.
The Human Rights Watch 2012 report shows how the
rights of the Iraqi people are violated with impunity by their new rulers.
In his book
Iraq - from War to a New
Authoritarianism, Toby Dodge of the London School of Economics
documents how the war has produced an Iraqi system of government not so
different from the one it replaced.
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Dodge
argues, is leading his country towards an incredibly destructive
dictatorship. The establishment of a liberal democracy on the banks of the
Tigris remains a neocon pipe dream.
So, Saddam is gone - but at what cost?
Iraq has been destroyed and hundreds of
thousands of innocent people have lost their lives, as the direct result of
an unnecessary, unprovoked war that, according to the former chief justice
Lord Bingham, was a serious violation of international law.
It was worse than a crime, said the French
diplomat Talleyrand, responding to the execution of the Duc dEnghien by
Napoleon; it was a blunder.
Iraq turned Talleyrands aphorism on its head -
it was worse than a blunder; it was a crime.
