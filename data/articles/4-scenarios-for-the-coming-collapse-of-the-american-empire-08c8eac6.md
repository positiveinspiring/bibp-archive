A soft landing for America 40 years from now?
Dont bet on it.
The demise of the United States as the global
superpower could come far more quickly than anyone imagines. If Washington
is dreaming of 2040 or 2050 as the end of the American Century, a more
realistic assessment of domestic and global trends suggests that in 2025,
just 15 years from now, it could all be over except for the shouting.
Despite the aura of omnipotence most empires project, a look at their
history should remind us that they are fragile organisms.
So delicate is their ecology of power that, when
things start to go truly bad, empires regularly unravel with unholy speed:
-
just a year for Portugal
-
two years for the Soviet Union
-
eight years for France
-
11 years for the Ottomans
-
17 years for Great Britain
-
in all likelihood, 22 years for the
United States, counting from the crucial year 2003
Future historians are likely to identify the
Bush administrations rash invasion of Iraq in that year as the start of
America's downfall.
However, instead of the bloodshed that marked
the end of so many past empires, with cities burning and civilians
slaughtered, this twenty-first century imperial collapse could come
relatively quietly through the invisible tendrils of economic collapse or
cyberwarfare.
But have no doubt:
when Washington's global dominion finally
ends, there will be painful daily reminders of what such a loss of power
means for Americans in every walk of life.
As a half-dozen European nations have
discovered, imperial decline tends to have a remarkably demoralizing impact
on a society, regularly bringing at least a generation of economic
privation.
As the economy cools, political temperatures rise, often sparking
serious domestic unrest.
Available economic, educational, and military data indicate that, when it
comes to U.S. global power, negative trends will aggregate rapidly by 2020
and are likely to reach a critical mass no later than 2030.
The American
Century, proclaimed so triumphantly at the start of World War II, will be
tattered and fading by 2025, its eighth decade, and could be history by
2030.
Significantly, in 2008, the U.S. National Intelligence Council admitted for
the first time that America's global power was indeed on a declining
trajectory.
In one of its
periodic futuristic reports,
Global Trends 2025, the Council cited,
the transfer of global wealth and economic
power now under way, roughly from West to East" and "without precedent
in modern history, as the primary factor in the decline of the United
States' relative strength - even in the military realm.
Like many in Washington, however, the Councils
analysts anticipated a very long, very soft landing for American global
preeminence, and harbored the hope that somehow the U.S. would long,
retain unique military capabilities
to
project military power globally for decades to come.
No such luck.
Under current projections, the United States
will find itself in second place behind China (already the world's second
largest economy) in economic output around 2026, and behind India by 2050.
Similarly, Chinese innovation is on a trajectory toward world leadership in
applied science and military technology sometime between 2020 and 2030, just
as America's current supply of brilliant scientists and engineers retires,
without adequate replacement by an ill-educated younger generation.
By 2020, according to current plans, the Pentagon will throw a military Hail
Mary pass for a dying empire. It will launch a lethal triple canopy of
advanced aerospace robotics that represents Washington's last best hope of
retaining global power despite its waning economic influence.
By that year, however, China's global network of
communications satellites, backed by the world's most powerful
supercomputers, will also be fully operational, providing Beijing with an
independent platform for the weaponization of space and a powerful
communications system for missile- or cyber-strikes into every quadrant of
the globe.
Wrapped in imperial hubris, like Whitehall or Quai d'Orsay before, the
White House still seems to imagine that American decline will be gradual,
gentle, and partial.
In his State of the Union address last January,
President
Obama
offered the reassurance that,
I do not accept second place for the United
States of America.
A few days later, Vice President Biden
ridiculed the very idea that,
we are destined to fulfill [historian Paul]
Kennedy's prophecy that we are going to be a great nation that has
failed because we lost control of our economy and overextended.
Similarly, writing in the November issue of the
establishment journal
Foreign Affairs, neo-liberal foreign policy
guru Joseph Nye waved away talk of China's economic and military
rise, dismissing misleading metaphors of organic decline and denying that
any deterioration in U.S. global power was underway.
Ordinary Americans, watching their jobs head overseas, have a more realistic
view than their cosseted leaders. An opinion poll in August 2010
found that 65% of Americans believed the
country was now in a state of decline.
Already,
Australia and
Turkey, traditional U.S. military allies,
are using their American-manufactured weapons for joint air and naval
maneuvers with China. Already, America's closest economic partners are
backing away from Washington's opposition to China's rigged currency rates.
As the president flew back from his Asian tour
last month, a gloomy
New York Times headline summed the moment
up this way:
Obama's Economic View Is Rejected on World
Stage, China, Britain and Germany Challenge U.S., Trade Talks With Seoul
Fail, Too.
Viewed historically, the question is not whether
the United States will lose its unchallenged global power, but just how
precipitous and wrenching the decline will be.
In place of Washington's wishful thinking, lets
use the National Intelligence Council's own futuristic methodology to
suggest four realistic scenarios for how, whether with a bang or a whimper,
U.S. global power could reach its end in the 2020s (along with four
accompanying assessments of just where we are today). The future scenarios
include: economic decline, oil shock, military misadventure, and World War
III.
While these are hardly the only possibilities
when it comes to American decline or even collapse, they offer a window into
an onrushing future.
Economic Decline -
Present Situation
Today, three main threats exist to Americas dominant position in the global
economy: loss of economic clout thanks to a shrinking share of world trade,
the decline of American technological innovation, and the end of the
dollar's privileged status as the global reserve currency.
By 2008, the United States had already
fallen to number three in global
merchandise exports, with just 11% of them compared to 12% for China and 16%
for the European Union. There is no reason to believe that this trend will
reverse itself.
Similarly, American leadership in technological innovation is on the wane.
In 2008, the U.S. was still
number two behind Japan in worldwide patent
applications with 232,000, but China was closing fast at 195,000, thanks to
a blistering 400% increase since 2000.
A harbinger of further decline:
in 2009 the U.S. hit rock bottom in ranking
among the 40 nations
surveyed by the Information Technology
& Innovation Foundation when it came to change in global
innovation-based competitiveness during the previous decade.
Adding
substance to these statistics, in October China's Defense Ministry
unveiled the world's fastest supercomputer, the Tianhe-1A, so powerful,
said one U.S. expert, that it blows
away the existing No. 1 machine in America.
Add to this clear evidence that the U.S.
education system, that source of future scientists and innovators, has been
falling behind its competitors.
After leading the world for decades in 25- to
34-year-olds with university degrees, the country
sank to 12th place in 2010. The World
Economic Forum
ranked the United States at a mediocre 52nd
among 139 nations in the quality of its university math and science
instruction in 2010. Nearly half of all graduate students in the sciences in
the U.S. are now foreigners, most of whom will be heading home, not staying
here as once would have happened.
By 2025, in other words, the United States is
likely to face a critical shortage of talented scientists.
Such negative trends are encouraging increasingly sharp criticism of the
dollar's role as the worlds reserve currency.
Other countries are no longer willing to
buy into the idea that the U.S. knows best on economic policy,
observed Kenneth S. Rogoff, a former
chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.
In mid-2009, with the world's central banks
holding an astronomical $4 trillion in U.S. Treasury notes, Russian
president Dimitri Medvedev
insisted that it was time to end the
artificially maintained unipolar system based on one formerly strong
reserve currency.
Simultaneously, China's central bank governor
suggested that the future might lie with a
global reserve currency disconnected from individual nations (that is, the
U.S. dollar).
Take these as signposts of a world to come, and
of a possible attempt, as economist Michael Hudson has
argued,
to hasten the bankruptcy of the U.S.
financial-military world order.
Economic Decline -
Scenario 2020
After years of swelling deficits fed by incessant warfare in distant lands,
in 2020, as long expected, the U.S. dollar finally loses its special status
as the world's reserve currency.
Suddenly, the cost of imports soars. Unable to
pay for swelling deficits by selling now-devalued Treasury notes abroad,
Washington is finally forced to slash its bloated military budget. Under
pressure at home and abroad, Washington slowly pulls U.S. forces back from
hundreds of overseas bases to a continental perimeter. By now, however, it
is far too late.
Faced with a fading superpower incapable of paying the bills, China, India,
Iran, Russia, and other powers, great and regional, provocatively challenge
U.S. dominion over the oceans, space, and cyberspace.
Meanwhile, amid soaring prices, ever-rising
unemployment, and a continuing decline in real wages, domestic divisions
widen into violent clashes and divisive debates, often over remarkably
irrelevant issues. Riding a political tide of disillusionment and despair, a
far-right patriot captures the presidency with thundering rhetoric,
demanding respect for American authority and threatening military
retaliation or economic reprisal.
The world pays next to no attention as the
American Century ends in silence.
Oil Shock - Present
Situation
One casualty of America's waning economic power has been its lock on global
oil supplies.
Speeding by America's gas-guzzling economy in
the passing lane, China became the world's number one energy consumer this
summer, a position the U.S. had held for over a century.
Energy specialist Michael Klare has
argued that this change means China will,
set the pace in shaping our global future.
By 2025, Iran and Russia will control almost
half of the world's natural gas supply, which will potentially give them
enormous leverage over energy-starved Europe.
Add petroleum reserves to the mix and, as the
National Intelligence Council has
warned, in just 15 years two countries,
Russia and Iran, could emerge as energy kingpins.
Despite remarkable ingenuity, the major oil powers are now draining the big
basins of petroleum reserves that are amenable to easy, cheap extraction.
The real lesson of the Deepwater Horizon
oil
disaster in the Gulf of Mexico was not BP's sloppy safety standards, but the
simple fact everyone saw on spillcam:
one of the corporate energy giants had
little choice but to search for what Klare
calls tough oil miles beneath the
surface of the ocean to keep its profits up.
Compounding the problem, the Chinese and Indians
have suddenly become far heavier energy consumers.
Even if fossil fuel supplies were to remain
constant (which they wont), demand, and so costs, are almost certain to
rise - and sharply at that. Other developed nations are meeting this threat
aggressively by plunging into experimental programs to develop
alternative
energy sources. The United States has taken a different path, doing far too
little to develop alternative sources while, in the last three decades,
doubling its dependence on foreign oil
imports.
Between 1973 and 2007, oil imports have
risen from 36% of energy consumed in the
U.S.
to 66%.
Oil Shock - Scenario
2025
The United States remains so dependent upon foreign oil that a few adverse
developments in the global energy market in 2025 spark an oil shock.
By comparison, it makes the 1973 oil shock (when
prices quadrupled in just months) look like the proverbial molehill. Angered
at the dollar's plummeting value, OPEC oil ministers, meeting in Riyadh,
demand future energy payments in a basket of Yen, Yuan, and Euros. That
only hikes the cost of U.S. oil imports further.
At the same moment, while signing a new series
of long-term delivery contracts with China, the Saudis stabilize their own
foreign exchange reserves by switching to the Yuan. Meanwhile, China pours
countless billions into building a massive trans-Asia pipeline and funding
Iran's exploitation of the world largest natural gas field at South Pars in
the Persian Gulf.
Concerned that the U.S. Navy might no longer be able to protect the oil
tankers traveling from the Persian Gulf to fuel East Asia, a coalition of
Tehran, Riyadh, and Abu Dhabi form an unexpected new Gulf alliance and
affirm that China's new fleet of swift aircraft carriers will henceforth
patrol the Persian Gulf from a base on the Gulf of Oman.
Under heavy economic pressure, London agrees to
cancel the U.S. lease on its Indian Ocean island base of Diego Garcia, while
Canberra, pressured by the Chinese, informs Washington that the Seventh
Fleet is no longer welcome to use Fremantle as a homeport, effectively
evicting the U.S. Navy from the Indian Ocean.
With just a few strokes of the pen and some terse announcements, the Carter
Doctrine, by which U.S. military power was to eternally protect
the Persian Gulf, is laid to rest in 2025. All the elements that long
assured the United States limitless supplies of low-cost oil from that
region - logistics, exchange rates, and naval power - evaporate.
At this point, the U.S. can still cover only an
insignificant 12% of its energy needs from
its nascent alternative energy industry, and remains dependent on imported
oil for half of its energy consumption.
The oil shock that follows hits the country like a hurricane, sending prices
to startling heights, making travel a staggeringly expensive proposition,
putting real wages (which had long been declining) into freefall, and
rendering non-competitive whatever American exports remained.
With
thermostats dropping, gas prices climbing
through the roof, and dollars flowing overseas in return for costly oil, the
American economy is paralyzed. With long-fraying alliances at an end and
fiscal pressures mounting, U.S. military forces finally begin a staged
withdrawal from their overseas bases.
Within a few years, the U.S. is functionally bankrupt and the clock is
ticking toward midnight on the American Century.
Military Misadventure
- Present Situation
Counter-intuitively, as their power wanes, empires often plunge into
ill-advised military misadventures.
This phenomenon is known among historians of
empire as micro-militarism and seems to involve psychologically
compensatory efforts to salve the sting of retreat or defeat by occupying
new territories, however briefly and catastrophically. These operations,
irrational even from an imperial point of view, often yield hemorrhaging
expenditures or humiliating defeats that only accelerate the loss of power.
Embattled empires through the ages suffer an arrogance that drives them to
plunge ever deeper into military misadventures until defeat becomes debacle.
-
In 413 BCE, a weakened Athens sent 200 ships to
be slaughtered in Sicily.
-
In 1921, a dying imperial Spain dispatched 20,000
soldiers to be massacred by Berber guerrillas in Morocco.
-
In 1956, a fading
British Empire destroyed its prestige by attacking Suez.
-
And in 2001 and 2003, the U.S. occupied
Afghanistan and invaded Iraq.
With the hubris that marks empires over the
millennia, Washington has increased its troops in Afghanistan to 100,000,
expanded the war into Pakistan, and
extended its commitment to 2014 and beyond,
courting disasters large and small in this guerilla-infested, nuclear-armed
graveyard of empires.
Military Misadventure
- Scenario 2014
So irrational, so unpredictable is micro-militarism that seemingly
fanciful scenarios are soon outdone by actual events.
With the U.S. military
stretched thin from Somalia to the Philippines and tensions rising in
Israel, Iran, and Korea, possible combinations for a disastrous military
crisis abroad are multifold.
Its mid-summer 2014 and a drawn-down U.S. garrison in embattled Kandahar in
southern Afghanistan is suddenly, unexpectedly overrun by Taliban
guerrillas, while U.S. aircraft are grounded by a blinding sandstorm.
Heavy loses are taken and in retaliation, an
embarrassed American war commander looses B-1 bombers and F-16 fighters to
demolish whole neighborhoods of the city that are believed to be under
Taliban control, while AC-130U Spooky gunships rake the rubble with
devastating cannon fire.
Soon, mullahs are preaching jihad from mosques throughout the region, and
Afghan Army units, long trained by American forces to turn the tide of the
war, begin to desert en masse. Taliban fighters then launch a series of
remarkably sophisticated strikes aimed at U.S. garrisons across the country,
sending American casualties soaring.
In scenes reminiscent of
Saigon in
1975 (below images), U.S. helicopters rescue American soldiers and civilians from rooftops
in Kabul and Kandahar.
Meanwhile, angry at the endless, decades-long stalemate over Palestine,
OPECs leaders impose a new oil embargo on the U.S. to protest its backing
of Israel as well as the killing of untold numbers of Muslim civilians in
its ongoing wars across the Greater Middle East.
With gas prices soaring and refineries running
dry, Washington makes its move, sending in Special Operations forces to
seize oil ports in the Persian Gulf. This, in turn, sparks a rash of suicide
attacks and the sabotage of pipelines and oil wells.
As black clouds billow skyward and diplomats
rise at the U.N. to bitterly denounce American actions, commentators
worldwide reach back into history to brand this America's Suez, a telling
reference to the 1956 debacle that marked the end of the British Empire.
World War III -
Present Situation
In the summer of 2010, military tensions between the U.S. and China began to
rise in the western Pacific, once considered an American lake.
Even a year earlier no one would have predicted
such a development. As Washington played upon its alliance with London to
appropriate much of Britain's global power after World War II, so China is
now using the profits from its export trade with the U.S. to fund what is
likely to become a military challenge to American dominion over the
waterways of Asia and the Pacific.
With its growing resources, Beijing is claiming a vast maritime arc from
Korea to Indonesia long dominated by the U.S. Navy.
In August, after Washington
expressed a national interest in the
South China Sea and conducted naval exercises there to reinforce that claim,
Beijing's official Global Times
responded angrily, saying,
The U.S.-China wrestling match over the
South China Sea issue has raised the stakes in deciding who the real
future ruler of the planet will be.
Amid growing tensions, the Pentagon
reported that Beijing now holds,
the capability to attack
[U.S.] aircraft
carriers in the western Pacific Ocean and target nuclear forces
throughout
the continental United States.
By developing offensive nuclear, space, and
cyber warfare capabilities, China seems determined to vie for dominance of
what the Pentagon calls,
the information spectrum in all dimensions
of the modern battlespace.
With ongoing development of the powerful Long
March V booster rocket, as well as the
launch of two satellites in January 2010
and
another in July, for a total of five,
Beijing signaled that the country was making rapid strides toward an
independent network of 35 satellites for global positioning,
communications, and reconnaissance capabilities by 2020.
To check China and extend its military position globally, Washington is
intent on building a new digital network of air and space robotics, advanced
cyberwarfare capabilities, and electronic surveillance.
Military planners expect this integrated system
to envelop the Earth in a cyber-grid capable of blinding entire armies on
the battlefield or taking out a single terrorist in field or favela.
By 2020, if all goes according to plan, the
Pentagon will launch a three-tiered shield of space drones - reaching from
stratosphere to exosphere, armed with agile missiles, linked by a resilient
modular satellite system, and operated through total telescopic
surveillance.
Last April, the Pentagon made history. It extended drone operations into the
exosphere by quietly
launching the X-37B unmanned space shuttle
into a low orbit 255 miles above the planet.
The
X-37B is the first in a new generation of
unmanned vehicles that will mark the full weaponization of space, creating
an arena for future warfare unlike anything that has gone before.
World War III -
Scenario 2025
The technology of space and cyberwarfare is so new and untested that even
the most outlandish scenarios may soon be superseded by a reality still hard
to conceive.
If we simply employ the sort of scenarios that
the Air Force itself
used in its 2009 Future Capabilities Game,
however, we can gain a better understanding of how air, space and
cyberspace overlap in warfare, and so begin to imagine how the next world
war might actually be fought.
Its 11:59 p.m. on Thanksgiving Thursday in 2025. While cyber-shoppers pound
the portals of Best Buy for deep discounts on the latest home electronics
from China, U.S. Air Force technicians at the Space Surveillance
Telescope (SST)
on Maui choke on their coffee as their panoramic screens suddenly blip to
black.
Thousands of miles away at the U.S.
CyberCommand's
operations center in Texas, cyberwarriors
soon detect malicious binaries that, though fired anonymously, show the
distinctive digital fingerprints of China's
People's Liberation Army.
The first overt strike is one nobody predicted. Chinese malware seizes
control of the robotics aboard an unmanned solar-powered U.S. Vulture
drone as it flies at 70,000 feet over the Tsushima Strait between Korea and
Japan.
It suddenly fires all the rocket pods beneath
its enormous 400-foot wingspan, sending dozens of lethal missiles plunging
harmlessly into the Yellow Sea, effectively disarming this formidable
weapon.
Determined to fight fire with fire, the White House authorizes a retaliatory
strike. Confident that its
F-6 Fractionated, Free-Flying satellite
system is impenetrable, Air Force commanders in California transmit robotic
codes to the flotilla of X-37B space drones orbiting 250 miles above the
Earth, ordering them to launch their Triple
Terminator missiles at China's 35 satellites.
Zero response. In near panic, the Air Force
launches its
Falcon Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle into an
arc 100 miles above the Pacific Ocean and then, just 20 minutes later, sends
the computer codes to fire missiles at seven Chinese satellites in nearby
orbits. The launch codes are suddenly inoperative.
As the Chinese virus spreads uncontrollably through the F-6 satellite
architecture, while those second-rate U.S. supercomputers fail to crack the
malware's devilishly complex code, GPS signals crucial to the navigation of
U.S. ships and aircraft worldwide are compromised.
Carrier fleets begin steaming in circles in the
mid-Pacific. Fighter squadrons are grounded. Reaper drones fly aimlessly
toward the horizon, crashing when their fuel is exhausted. Suddenly, the
United States loses what the U.S. Air Force has long called the
ultimate high ground: space.
Within hours, the military power that had
dominated the globe for nearly a century has been defeated in World War III
without a single human casualty.
A New World Order?
Even if future events prove duller than these four scenarios suggest, every
significant trend points toward a far more striking decline in American
global power by 2025 than anything Washington now seems to be envisioning.
As allies worldwide begin to realign their policies to take cognizance of
rising Asian powers, the cost of maintaining 800 or more overseas military
bases will simply become unsustainable, finally forcing a staged withdrawal
on a still-unwilling Washington. With both the U.S. and China in a race to
weaponize space and cyberspace, tensions between the two powers are bound to
rise, making military conflict by 2025 at least feasible, if hardly
guaranteed.
Complicating matters even more, the economic, military, and technological
trends outlined above will not operate in tidy isolation.
As happened to European empires after World War
II, such negative forces will undoubtedly prove synergistic. They will
combine in thoroughly unexpected ways, create crises for which Americans are
remarkably unprepared, and threaten to spin the economy into a sudden
downward spiral, consigning this country to a generation or more of economic
misery.
As U.S. power recedes, the past offers a spectrum of possibilities for a
future world order. At one end of this spectrum, the rise of a new global
superpower, however unlikely, cannot be ruled out.
Yet both China and Russia evince
self-referential cultures, recondite non-roman scripts, regional defense
strategies, and underdeveloped legal systems, denying them key instruments
for global dominion.
At the moment then, no single superpower seems
to be on the horizon likely to succeed the U.S.
In a dark, dystopian version of our global future, a coalition of
transnational corporations, multilateral forces like NATO, and an
international financial elite could conceivably forge a single, possibly
unstable, supra-national nexus that would make it no longer meaningful to
speak of national empires at all. While denationalized corporations and
multinational elites would assumedly rule such a world from secure urban
enclaves, the multitudes would be relegated to urban and rural wastelands.
In
Planet of Slums, Mike Davis offers
at least a partial vision of such a world from the bottom up.
He argues that the billion people already packed
into fetid favela-style slums worldwide (rising to two billion by 2030) will
make,
the 'feral, failed cities' of the Third
World
the distinctive battlespace of the twenty-first century.
As darkness settles over some future super-favela,
the empire can deploy Orwellian
technologies of repression as hornet-like helicopter gun-ships stalk
enigmatic enemies in the narrow streets of the slum districts
Every
morning the slums reply with suicide bombers and eloquent explosions.
At a midpoint on the spectrum of possible
futures, a new global oligopoly might emerge between 2020 and 2040, with
rising powers
China, Russia, India, and Brazil collaborating with receding
powers like Britain, Germany, Japan, and the United States to enforce an ad
hoc global dominion, akin to the loose alliance of European empires that
ruled half of humanity circa 1900.
Another possibility: the rise of regional hegemons in a return to something
reminiscent of the international system that operated before modern empires
took shape.
In this neo-Westphalian world order, with its
endless vistas of micro-violence and unchecked exploitation, each hegemon
would dominate its immediate region - Brasilia in South America, Washington
in North America, Pretoria in southern Africa, and so on.
Space, cyberspace, and the maritime deeps,
removed from the control of the former planetary policeman, the United
States, might even become a new global commons, controlled through an
expanded U.N. Security Council or some ad hoc body.
All of these scenarios extrapolate existing trends into the future on the
assumption that Americans, blinded by the arrogance of decades of
historically unparalleled power, cannot or will not take steps to manage the
unchecked erosion of their global position.
If America's decline is in fact on a 22-year trajectory from 2003 to 2025,
then we have already frittered away most of the first decade of that decline
with wars that distracted us from long-term problems and, like water tossed
onto desert sands,
wasted trillions of desperately needed
dollars.
If only 15 years remain, the odds of frittering them all away still remain
high.
Congress and the president are now in gridlock;
the American system is flooded with corporate money meant to jam up the
works; and there is little suggestion that any issues of significance,
including our wars, our bloated national security state, our starved
education system, and our antiquated energy supplies, will be addressed with
sufficient seriousness to assure the sort of soft landing that might
maximize our country's role and prosperity in a changing world.
Europe's empires are gone and America's imperium is going.
It seems
increasingly doubtful that the United States will have anything like
Britain's success in shaping a succeeding world order that protects its
interests, preserves its prosperity, and bears the imprint of its best
values.
