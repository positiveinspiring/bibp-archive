Conversation

Kerry Cassidy: This is Kerry Cassidy
and Bill Ryan from Project Camelot, and we're here with George Green,
hoping to get an update on the world today. And it's Wednesday where we
are, actually, at 9 in the morning. And where you are, its 9 at night.
Is that right, George?
George Green: Thats correct.
K: On Tuesday night. Youre on October 21st, the evening, in the
United States. So tell me whats going on with you.
G: Well, Im observing the world meltdown right now in a lot of
different directions. As you probably are aware, the G-8s meeting...
everybodys getting together. And Bush went over to see Sarkozy in
France. But the G-8 people are not willing to take the dollar as the
base currency from now on. So theyre postponing their meeting till
after the election, when Obama gets in.
K: So what does that mean? Does that mean that our money isnt good in
Europe?
G: What theyre trying to do is get a currency that they count on. Most
of the world now is recognizing that the dollar is a dead currency,
because they just got through putting out, as you know, another 250
billion into the banks. And under the fractional banking system, that
made another 2.5 trillion dollars worth of debt available to put out
into the system. But nobodys borrowing the money.
K: Oh, really.
G: Thats correct. I mean, its made available, but everybody is
concerned right now. Because not only is that happening, but everybodys
being laid off. I mean, Ford Motor Company has laid off another 10% of
their staff. That was today. Its stock has dropped down. All of the car
companies, the sales are down 30 and 40%. Boeings people that are on
strike - I understand that they may be laying off another 20,000
people. Nobody talks about the unemployment situation.
And theyre also not talking in another area, which is the next
meltdown, and that is the derivatives area on credit cards throughout
the world. Many credit cards right now, in other countries, arent being
accepted. As you go to use a major credit card, it wont go through.
K: Ah...
G: Because of the banking stream.
K: Fascinating. Do you know which credit cards?
G: No; theyre all being affected. It just depends on what the credit
people are doing. I mean, even...You can go check it out from when the
local credit people - did they want to take the risk and making sure
that theyre going to advance money on it to the local people?
So what theyre doing is, theyre just trying to get verification on
everything. So if youre in a foreign country, like you are right now,
if the hotel or stuff will not take your credit card, then you have to
call for verification back. And thats a possibility, because thats
whats happening all over, because most of the money being traded right
now is digitized anyway.
K: Right.
G: Now you have the other thing that happened. As you know, the Iraqi
government is not going to go along with the terms of the United States
right now, and they want to delay till after Obama comes in, also. And
thats because they want to have control and get the troops out of their
country.
K: Oh, for sure. Im sure. No doubt about that. But I believe thatll
never happen.
G: Well, thats what theyre trying to say, that itll never happen, but
remember, weve been doing all kinds of things with the Iraqi people. So
we have to watch the play going on.
Now, my other sources are saying that when Obama gets in, within
probably 3 to 4 months, Kerry, we have to do something, because the
unemployment and the massive repression thats going to happen around
the planet - actually going into depression in many places - is going
to cause the people behind the scenes, in order to get something going,
to begin WW III.
K: Right. Yeah. I do understand that that might be a tactic. What is
going on with this Mutual Fund deal? Because didnt they just try to put
money into propping up the Mutual Funds?
G: Well, it wasnt the Mutual Funds. Youre talking about the... People
were putting money into Mutual Funds as a backup for the money. In other
words, your cash, you put it into a cash account and they put it in
there.
But what the provisions were, they said they would guarantee - all
these are Money Market Mutual Funds - they would guarantee the Money
Market Mutual Funds only for the people who had money in there at that
time. Well, 12 billion dollars went into Money Market Mutual Funds the
very next day. So theres a lot of negotiations going back and forth. So
they want to cover that too.
Now thats everybody thats running around trying to save their assets,
Kerry. Thats the biggest problem we have.
And I had a meeting the other day with some of my banking friends in the
real estate end of it, and theyre still expecting over 11 million
foreclosures to happen next year.
And Im having a meeting next week with two senators. And you know what,
the last comment they made to me - which I thought was very important - they said within six months, you will not recognize the dollar. So my
meeting I have next week will be very interesting on that.
K: Wow. OK. I mean, there is so much stuff going on right now. Its
coming incredibly fast and furious.
G: Thats correct.
K: I understand the stock market was down another 200...
G: 250 points.
K: Yes.
G: Now, the problem with the stock market is people are aware that their
stocks are being traded. Theyre not aware that only a few of the
stocks... In other words, they may be in...
Lets give you an illustration: If you have 100 stocks that were traded,
100 different companies, they can manipulate 3 or 4 of those companies
and cause the appearance that its going up. It cant shift 1,000 points
in one day like it did without it being controlled.
And the control mechanism is the Federal Reserve itself, through its
Plunge Committee, which is basically some of the members of the, as
you know, the Federal Reserve as well as the government itself, that are
manipulating a few stocks in order to maintain what they call sanity
within the street. Because everybody in the United States is in a fear
mode right now. They dont want to buy stocks. So theres panic.
K: Sure.
G: Theres about 2.5 trillion dollars worth of stocks that have
evaporated. If youre asking my professional opinion? I told you, I
think a month ago, I said that the stocks would go down to about 8,500.
Well, it hit the 8,500, as you know.
K: Yes.
G: The next level... Well, its up over around 9,000 right now, but I
think with the melt-off that Im feeling from other sources... because
OPEC is meeting because of the decline in the oil. People are not
acquiring things like they did. I see the stock market going clear down
to 3,500, frankly.
K: 3,500?
G: You bet.
K: Wow. OK. There are people out there actually buying stock. Who would
you say that is? Are there people trying to, you know, make a quick
buck, and then get out again?
G: Well, the Mutual Funds are the ones that have all the assets. The
individual person is not doing... Theyre just trying to save
themselves. And the ones that are sitting by with all their 401-Ks and
the rest of them, are just watching their assets going away. They dont
have a lot of control on this.
K: Yes.
G: But the Mutual Funds themselves control 60% of the stocks that are
being traded.
K: Oh, really. So its the major funds.
G: Exactly. The major funds. And the hedge funds right now, because they
were always betting on the market going in a different direction. All of
a sudden all of this is running away and its causing them to dump
massive amounts of their stocks, including their positions in gold and
silver, and other commodities, frankly - which is causing a whole
drift-down.
But the whole rest of the worlds in the same boat. Chinas backing off.
You know, China and Japan are still meeting, as you well know, on trying
to figure out a new currency, because nobody wants to use the dollar.
They want to break, you know, the Bretton Woods Agreement, which said
that we would use the dollar as the bank currency and it would remain
the level throughout the world.
Well, they dont want to do that any more. And thats what everybodys
talking about. What kind of meeting can they have? And they all... They
want to have this meeting after the new president gets in. That means...
My question is: When he gets office - when he takes office in January?
Or after he gets through being elected?
So somethings going to happen in the next couple of weeks, that were
going to see the changes that are happening.
Meanwhile, the meltdown of the markets obviously going to go on. And
the market represents nothing. It doesnt have any business at all other
than trading between the brokers.
And this was on national television - they sat down with the brokers in
New York. They didnt care which way the markets going, up or down,
because they make money trading, whether selling or buying. So theyre
just having a field day with all this.
And meanwhile, the American people - their so-called illusion of equity
is going away, as well as foreigners who bought into the drama.
And thats whats happening. And the derivative market is sold out to
the entire world in various denominations. And theyre not even touching
the credit card derivatives. And thats going to come out in the next
couple of weeks.
K: OK. When you say whats going to happen when - I was going to say
when Obama gets into office - but when whoever wins gets into office.
G: Oh, Obamas already named, Kerry. Ive told you that before.
K: Yes.
G: Hes been named the next president. And hes already got the
Electoral College, so we dont care what happens at this point. Hes
going to get the popular vote and the rest of it.
K: Well, hes...
G: The rest of its just a show.
K: Do you think the election is going ahead, though, on schedule?
G: Yeah. I do. Sure. Thats two weeks.
K: OK. Yeah. You know that Obama is down in Florida right now meeting
with the former head of, what is it, the Federal Reserve?
G: You mean with Volcker?
K: Yes.
G: Well, he may be. Hes gonna get an education. First of all, he came
into this thing... Hes being given information by a lot of the insiders
that are up close to the top that are trying to tell him which way to
go.
You know, Volcker and I actually flew together on a plane from Aspen
back to Denver. And, you know, this man at that time - of course, as
chairman of the Federal Reserve, I figured was the most powerful man in
the world - but he just represents the most powerful men, you know, the
ones that run the Federal Reserve.
K: Yeah. For sure.
G: And so, when the Feds have a meeting, theyre going to give him an
education on trying to keep the Federal Reserve going. The trouble is,
the Federal Reserve could collapse. So youre looking at a total
collapse and a total depression, not recession, a depression in the
United States. And the rest of the worlds going to follow suit.
K: Right. OK. So what is the currency that people are going to be
looking at in the future? Because if the dollar is gone, what are we
looking at? Were looking at some major currency? A brand new currency
for the whole world?
G: Yeah. Well, thats what... Yeah, a brand new currency is what the G-8
people are talking about right now.
I mean, some of the data that I got later on today was talking about,
you know, they have to do something in coordinating with Japan, China,
and Russia. And theyve all said they do not want the dollar involved.
So the United States, of course, is trying to push this.
And remember, its only been done by the idea that we would have
aggression and wed go out...were the most powerful people in the
world... would have been allowed to stabilize this.
Well, this is all coming undone everywhere. So youre asking for what
the new currency is? I dont know what. Thats what theyre meeting on
right now. And Ill hopefully have more of an indication next week with
the senators. Because, like I say, theyre involved with some of this.
At least they have the information, you know, the stuff thats being
talked behind the scenes.
K: Yeah. I bet. Well, I also wonder whats going on, you know, about
their preparations for anything like martial law, that sort of thing. Do
you think youre going to hear anything about that?
G: Well, theyre already making motions on that. I will know more
details about that at the end of the meeting - I think its next Friday
or Saturday - that Im having with them. And well be discussing
exactly which way to go. Because theyre trying to protect the same
thing.
Now, my CIA - the Crooks-In-Action - friends that I have [Kerry
laughs], you know, theyre just totally happy that theyre leaving the
country or have left the country. They just dont see the United States
as being a good place to be. [laughs]
K: Right. So what theyre basically doing is living in South America.
G: Thats right.
K: And theyll still to have to, you know, live their lives and have
some kind of currency down there.
G: Well, Brazil has its own currency. Tonight on television theyre
saying that theyre OK. Theyre recognizing that were going to have a
slight slow-down there. But their economy is based on what they have in
the exported goods.
Remember, Germany itself said they dont care either. But they sell
goods to other parts of the world also. The United States... Remember,
we only have 4-1/2% of the worlds population.
K: Right.
G: The rest of the world cant be running on a few things thatre going
on over here, because were not consuming anything.
I mean, theres houses... Everywhere across the country that I go right
now, theres blocks upon blocks of them that are for sale. Where Im at
right now, across the street two years ago was selling for $450,000. The
bank sold it the other day at $126,000.
K: Youre kidding me! Wow!
G: No, Im not.
K: Thats amazing.
G: Well, theyre trying to get cash. Thats the trouble. They have to do
that or the banks... Its called REO, real estate owned, and if they do
take the property back, then they have to pull back, you know, unwrap
the leverage position they had because of the fractional reserve system.
Now, thats basically what theyre talking right now, putting out money
into the banks so they can continue to gain. But nobody wants to buy
anything right now because theyre afraid they might not have a job on
Friday.
K: OK. What do you think...? I mean, isnt the writing on the wall going
to be really strong when December comes around and nobody, you know, is
shopping, as the retail sector goes down?
G: Well, theyre already reporting that sales are down. Ive already
said that Sears and K-Mart both arent reporting sales right now,
because if they did that, then their stock could go way down. And Im
saying the only way they can do is go - what they did a couple years
ago - go back into bankruptcy.
K: So what about this thing where Kirkorian is selling a stake in Ford?
G: Well, hes getting rid of all of it because Ford is technically
bankrupt.
K: Right. And I understand that GM is looking for a major investor as
well.
G: General Motors is an interesting situation, because most of the car
companies, if you look at it, got rid of most of their liabilities when
they dumped all of the pension funds, all of the health benefits, on the
Unions themselves. The Unions thought they were doing a good thing by
assuming liability but that was upside-down. Thats not being addressed
to the public yet. You remember all the health benefits that supposedly
the workers got.
But GM, because their sales are down 30-some percent, as you know, and
Fords 40-some percent. Will Ford exist in the next year? Thats the
next question.
So theyre all trying to look at it on a world basis, the merger of
things, and if they could come out with something new... Now, Indias
coming out with a new car, as you know, and Chinas come out with one,
for $3,000!
K: Oh really. OK. Well, what about the idea thats in the news today?
Indias launching an orbiter to the Moon. What do you think of that?
Whats that all about?
G: Well, thats just to show that they have the nuclear power and the
capability. China and India are doing a 2-1/2-billion-dollar new project
together.
India has done two things. The United States has made an agreement, and
they tell everybody, to put a billion-dollar reactor in India. But India
also made the same deal with Russia. Russias going to put in a nuclear
reactor. As you know, Russias been putting nuclear reactors all over.
And this is to get energy.
Now, their refinery was a joint venture between China and India on their
border, a refinery for petroleum products. Now, obviously with the
slowdown... Now Chinas having a slowdown; Indias going to have a
slowdown. But these two countries together, as you know, China and
India, represent almost 40% of the worlds population.
And theyre in the position right now of not... Their food production
and everything is able for themselves at this minute. So our exports - because weve been living on exporting our products and stuff to them
- theyre gonna ignore them in this minute until we get some kind of level
playing-field with the money.
So the next two weeks, like you and I are watching, when the G-8 meets,
and if they continue the game until after a year but I dont think
they can continue past after the election, frankly at that point well
know which way the moss is going to flow. I mean, theyre going to feel
comfortable about it and at that point theyll want to get a new
currency so they can have some kind of exchange going.
Thats probably part of the reason that the Bank of International
Settlements, as you know, a couple months ago, got permission from the
Bush administration to audit the Federal Reserve.
There are so many things going on behind the scenes right now. If they
can audit the Federal Reserve... Remember, many congressmen have been
trying to do that for many years right now, even Ron Paul.
K: So what does that entail? If they audit the Federal Reserve, what are
they going to find out? Are they going to find out about black projects,
for example? Or is this...
G: Theyre going to find out that theyre been... the money... the
percentage games... When you join the franchise... Like I explained
before, if youre a franchise like Best Western or Marriott or whatever,
you pay... A percentage of the income goes back to the franchisee.
Well, the Federal Reserve is the franchisee. So they get a percentage of
everything. But theyve got to give a fee back to the Bank of
International Settlements. Thats the bankers bank.
Well, what if they find out that theyve been lied to all the way?
Theyre just going to shut the system down and now were going to be in
something totally new and nobody really knows whats going to come out
of this. Like I say, were going to be in a massive depression.
Im hoping people will have at least two or three months worth of food
stored up. Im telling everybody to get cash, you know, a couple months
in small bills $1s, $5s, $10s and $20s nothing more than that. Its
just so youll be able to exchange, whether or not theyre gonna be
worth anything.
I mean, theres some talk, with some of my other broker friends, they
say were gonna have two currencies, one that you can use in the United
States. And something else overseas. Now, you know, youre overseas now.
Will they still accept the dollar?
K: Well... you know, yeah, theyve accepted it, In other words, Ive
traded it in, you know. I traded in the dollar. Actually, as you know,
theyre propping up the dollar at the moment.
G: Right.
K: I mean, the US dollar is actually worth more right now than the
Aussie dollar, which is supposed to be a good currency and fairly
stable.
G: Well, theyve done this. This is an arbitrary, you know,
thought-provoking thing. So weve got the government basically
nationalizing all the banks, nationalizing everything so they can say
this is a strong currency.
But we dont produce anything. Kerry, one out of 3 people in the United
States work for the government.
K: No!
G: Thats correct. One out of three people work for companies that have
contracts with the government.
Now we have the next problem: 50% of the people in the United States - thats half of them
- are over age 50.
K: Right. Well, the people that are working for companies that have
contracts with the government is the military-industrial complex, so
youre talking about companies like Boeing and Northrop and so and so
forth. And they are all... all about building war machines.
G: Exactly.
K: That will keep them going...
G: And all their stock has gone down today.
K: All of it?
G: All their stock has gone down. And Boeing has been on strike. Their
workers have been on it. And the people in Seattle... I was talking to
em the other day. In fact, I flew in with em. They were talking about,
well, theyre probably gonna get laid off. Well, they could lay off
23,000 of em.
K: OK. But if the defense industry starts going down, then thats when
you have to look to the situation where theyre going to create some
event.
G: There you go.
K: Right?
G: There you go. Youve got the right idea, about what I feel; its the
same boat. The next thing theyre gonna have to do is address the
problem. Because weve still got 40% of the world existing on less than
$2 a day.
I mean, everythings out of balance. Were increasing the population on
the planet, you know, 200,000-plus a day, or 5 million a month. Wheres
all the food? Wheres all the things coming from? And its coming to the
critical end.
Its a challenge for us, you and I and everybody else I know, to keep
ahead of all the information. And I get tons of it thrown at me from all
over the globe. I mean, I get calls...
K: Well, youve actually become kind of a focus-point, I think, at this
time, just because of your incredible, you know, financial acumen, and
then everything else that youve got going behind you. So, I mean,
people are contacting you right and left. Id love to know, or be
sitting in on some of those conversations youre having right now.
G: Well, Im sure. And Id enjoy doing that, and I think at some
point... Im talking to people right now, of having some kind of a, you
know, maybe a weekly newsletter, up on my website, or something that
comes down on these things, to keep up with the data thats coming in.
Meanwhile, theyre all talking in every direction about shutting down
the net because of the information.
K: Nah. Well, OK. Have you also heard about the situation with these, I
dont know... ships? Theres like three of them out there with
radioactive waste from out of Taiwan?
G: The radioactivity is a real problem. Yeah, Ive heard about that,
that theyve put the ships out there. Theyre going off...
Weve dumped so much radiation into the ocean, Kerry, and weve, you
know... My friends down in Alamogordo called me thats in New Mexico.
The government, they said, is trying to burn waste. Im talking about
nuclear waste. You cant burn that! You just put more radiation in the
air. Thats already the...
I mean, why did they start the Non-Proliferation Agreement immediately
after they stopped dropping all these bombs? Thats because we messed up
the atmosphere. Thats whats eating holes in the ozone.
So radiation is affecting everything, but its slow-moving. Thats the
whole basis... You cant have radiation thats being transmitted into
people, like the crazy uranium [depleted uranium], as you are well
aware, that were using in shells. Yeah, it hardens the shells and it
does things. But look at the Iraqi people! And look whats happening to
our soldiers coming back here.
K: Oh yeah. Absolutely.
G: And thats... You know, all of these little pieces fit into the
puzzle. And when I talk to some of my medical professionals, you know,
on the problem, they dont really have a solution on this thing. Because
this is not an instant thing where you kind of click on, all of a
sudden, youre... You know. The cancers that are formed within your
body... Because were kind of an adaptable species.
K: Exactly. Well, yeah. And we have to actually rely on that to stay
alive.
What about the prices of gold and silver right now? Because it seems
like theyre just keeping that stuff down.
G: Well, thats the thing. Sure. The hedge funds are dumping to try to
get liquidity, so they took big positions in the metal. I think thatll
be turning around in the next two weeks, frankly.
K: OK. The paper versus the actual metal? Is there going to be a
discrepancy there? Or if it goes up, will it go up everywhere?
G: Well, heres the problem right now... Because I just got, am getting,
10,000 ounces of metal and my delivery time is like... 2 months? Forget
it! And my silver and my gold...
They have so many people now that are going to the metals. The price
that they quote in New York right now is basically the London market,
which is done by paper thats supposedly paper-on-deposit. Wherever they
have the gold and stuff, theyre selling the paper. And thats supposed
to be determining the price on it.
Well, I just got through paying a couple dollars over spot. Im buying
two dollars over spot because theres none available. Theres something
wrong with this picture.
K: OK. And so...
G: Sure, they tell you that gold dropped down $20 today. And I said:
Well, gee, I just paid - Just to give you an idea, I paid $903 for an
ounce of gold because there wasnt any available.
K: OK. So... I dont understand. How can the price go down?
G: Well, because the hedges are dumping their prices. This is an
arbitrary... Thats the trouble with the stock market. When they have
100 shares trade in a stock, it determines the value of the other
2-million shares that are trading. See, we have an arbitrary thing
thats being manipulated by these few things.
The Data Institute - thats a group of people that are in the gold, and
theyve been checking and following this - theyve been trying to get
Congress to investigate on how they manipulate the price of gold and
silver. Well, theres only so much. The silver...
Im about 20 miles from the Silver Valley up here, the second largest
silver production in the continental United States, up here in Idaho.
And I was with the president of the company, and we were discussing, you
know, the global situation. We have maybe four-and-a-half-months of
silver, overall, in reserve, to cover for the world. What happens in
four months?
The other problem is, the EPA and the rest of em are coming in and
theyre shutting down the mines because of whats happening, because the
mines price of silver is down. So were going to eat this up.
Its kind of like having the oil people... OPEC is moving in the same
direction. Well, people have quit using it for a little bit. It wont be
too long before you wont have the production there and, you know... I
looked at, believe it or not, gasoline today at $2.66 a gallon.
K: [laughs] So this should be good news, but in reality its a problem.
Right?
G: Well... Because the next thing is, how many people now arent paying
their rent? How many people are out of a job? And the government is now
talking about extending more unemployment benefits. In other words, just
giving money out to people to go look at it.
I talked to one of the workers that, you know, helps the senior citizens
that cant take care of themselves? Some of these people arent even
getting food. I mean, its deplorable, just listening to the stories of
whats happening. The food banks are out of food, you know the ones that
help people that go in for Food Stamps? They dont have any.
K: Yeah. Absolutely. OK. We have been hearing something about, I dont
know, something - this is from a secret source - saying to be very
careful. Because, you know, Im flying back into the United States.
And theyre saying something could be up, that some of the forces on a
secret level are working very hard to make sure nothing happens on US
soil, saying between now and the inauguration. Have you heard anything
on that level?
G: Well, I heard two things. One thing, they were trying to get
something so we could have a national emergency called. But Im
concerned on two different areas on that.
I think that youre right. Were in the stable deal. But, as you know,
my partner is a clairvoyant and shes very... Lets put it this way: She
feels somethings going on right now as you and I speak. And shes been
talking to some other people in London that are friends like her, and
they say the same thing: Within the next 60 days something majors gonna
happen. But they didnt pinpoint what was gonna happen, Kerry.
K: Oh really. So...
G: Yeah.
K: So, are you guys planning to tactfully, possibly, exit, you know,
stage right, so to speak?
G: Well, I have my tickets, and I was just working on it, to go down to
Ecuador. Im supposed to go to a couple places. I was gonna come down
and see you but I dont think Im going to make it. I may come down to
Arizona.
K: Well, Im going to be in Arizona, so, you know, I wish you...
G: Yeah. I may be doing that and then heading off. Tomorrow Ill know
more of my schedule. But I do have tickets already and Im planning
on... you know, its kind of family thing... but in the next four weeks
Ill be down in Ecuador.
K: Really. OK. What do you thinks going to go on as far as once Obama
gets into office? Because... I dont know. Ive heard that actually
thats not going to help matters, so to speak, as much as people think
it is.
G: Oh. Its not. Obama will get into it. They want to set this whole
thing up so the whole democratic thing all falls apart anyway. And he
doesnt know what hes getting into, frankly. I mean, hes being pushed
to get in.
Its kind of like, you know... Sarah Palin, once she got, took, the
offer to become the vice president up there... They just got her out of
the way for what she was doing up in Alaska.
K: Right.
G: She was doing good for the State of Alaska. Now they just pulled her
away from all the play.
K: Oh, thats interesting.
G: And the story behind that is unbelievable.
K: So shes been distracted, basically, because of the whole oil
industry.
G: Thats it. Thats right. They get her out.
K: Why did they want to take her away, though?
G: Well, if you notice, in Alaska the senators and other people are
being indicted for fraud and that. And the people that control...
32 out of 33 of the strategic minerals in the world are located up in
Alaska. And the inner group up there was giving it to their buddies. How
do you think they get all these new airplanes and all these trips and
all the rest of this stuff? Its a payoff.
So the big companies continue to gain, with Alaska as big as it is. You
dont realize the size of it. If you started from Miami and went to
Seattle, thats about the size of Alaska.
K: Yeah.
G: And they dont have many people up there.
K: Thats right.
G: And so, meanwhile, because of whats happening on climate changes and
everything else, all these mineral resources and the availability of
having the Alaskan government, if you want to look at it, being very
favorable to the inner group so they could get on and rape more of the
planet, you know, taking the mineral resources.
Sarah was stopping all that. They said: If youre gonna do that, then
you want to make it so the people of Alaska benefit from it.
So they just dangled the bait: Hey, Ill make you vice president. She
jumped on it. The Lieutenant-Governor up there... The
Lieutenant-Governor of Alaska was just bought and paid for.
So now they put her up there and she thinks shes doing a good thing.
But actually the vice president has no power.
K: [laughs] Right. Well, in the case where Obama wins, shes not going
to be in the game anyway. And I sort of think she was taken out by that
family incident, where the... you know, he lost his job.
G: No. Thats a distraction. It was all over the other stuff, over the
mineral resources and stuff, so they could get control and get her out
of it. But thats OK.
K: OK. Very interesting.
G: Well, its the power game. You know, absolute power corrupts
absolutely. But if we can get you... Thats the aphrodisiac: Well put
you in a position of power.
Then you start looking... Always follow the money. These people are all
manipulating. Why is Volcker having a meeting - you know, the former
chairman, as you say - with Obama right now? Maybe hes gonna bring him
up and say: Wait a minute, you gotta help. You gotta do something to
prevent the...
Whats happening is, even most of the Congress, even though theyre
aware of the Federal Reserve, they dont know that were being
indirectly manipulated.
K: Oh, for sure. The game goes far beyond that.
What do you think about Joe Biden? Do you think hes really going to
make it into office, you know, as the vice president behind Obama?
Because we had word that Hillary was going to be back on the ticket. And
I know theres only two weeks left [until the election], so it seems
absurd that that would happen. But I heard that health problems might
crop up, or it could be other things.
G: No. I think hes gonna get into office. But I think Hillary, and the
same thing with the other players... Hes just getting his Chief of
Staff up there. And Im sure Hillary and Bill and the rest of emll all
be into some position and make a big difference. They really will.
K: Oh yeah.
G: You know, when you look at our dear retired general [Powell], hes
already been Secretary of State for a couple of times. But, you know,
ethically, he was just lead down the primrose path when they came down
to the deal in Iraq on the whole stuff. But this is all part of that
intelligence community we have out there. You know, the CIA, the
Crooks-in-Action.
K: OK. Well, what about Colin Powell coming out on the side of Obama?
Behind the scenes, do you know which faction is backing Obama, besides,
you know, the obvious?
G: Well, no. The Rockefellers wanted Obama in a long time ago. But when
you talk about Colin Powell, you know that hes moving into position to
be one of his... And he submitted, as you know, on the meeting of it,
because he tends to be willing to serve his president. So theyll put
him into some position. Hes great for working out the Middle East.
Again, the wild card in this whole thing is: What are we gonna be
dealing with? Because were now a bankrupt country. Our currencys not
going to be allowed any place.
And you know what happened in Iraq today. Their government just backed
off of all of these requirements for pulling out. And I think that the
governments saying: Get out of Iraq. And theyre waiting for Obama to
get in, and thats part of the delay.
K: OK.
G: Even though theyve got... You know, they have the biggest embassy.
The United States has the biggest embassy in the world. Its over in
Iraq right now.
K: Except my understanding is that the reasons they went into Iraq to
begin with is because they want to guard that Stargate thats there,
during the time when what may be Planet X comes around and/or some of
the changes that are happening here behind the scenes with ETs and so
on.
G: Well, I cant... For that area Im not really too sure because I was
involved with the other people who were involved with...
You know, it all goes back to the days when the Iraq War A [Desert
Storm] started. You know, the Kuwaitis were slant-drilling underneath
the Iraqi territory and they brought it in. Its all over oil for right
now.
The Iraqi thing has obviously got a lot of artifacts and stuff over in
Iraq that show the extraterrestrial connection. And is there a Stargate
there? Or are there other places around the planet? I mean, were all
interested...
Were all going into an interesting time, Kerry, and I cant really give
you an answer on what youre saying on that.
K: OK. But you do have, you know... I mean, youre still getting some
downloads, are you not? From your Pleiadians?
G: My ETs?
K: Yes.
G: Yeah. Well, theyre above the Pleiadians.
K: They are?
G: Yeah. The information I get is from a higher energy source than the
Pleiadians. I mean, theyre just kind of like you and I are. And most of
the Pleiadians, frankly, I think have left. Most of em have left the
planet. Its other extraterrestrials now that are sitting there rubbing
their fingers, hoping were going to destroy ourselves.
K: OK. So what are you getting from your sources? Are you writing this
stuff down like you did? Because, you know, you have your three books
out there.
G: Four.
K: And we can say: Handbook for a New Paradigm, Embracing the Rainbow,
and Becoming.
G: Yeah, but theres another one, the Messages to the Ground Crew. That
was the last name. That one really said it in big spades. It said just
get ready for the big, you know, unbridled truth thats coming on to the
whole planet.
K: OK. Well, you know, we created a forum thats all around the Ground
Crew and weve got a huge... I guess weve got 4,000 people visiting it
every day.
G: Im going to get on there this week, I promise. Ill get on there
myself.
K: [laughs]
G: I have been so busy. And Im glad you do. Ive got, like, 12,000 on
my own list just in the last year. [laughs]
K: Wow.
G: And Im working with some people right now that are trying to manage
my own website better because its just unbelievable the number of
actions were getting. I mean, you know, on the whole, like youre
getting, and so am I. [laughs] Well see what we can do.
K: Well, let me ask you this, because were just about to release
another interview with Bob Dean who has come forward. And he actually
spoke at the UFO Expo, and I think he broke the news there. But hes
coming forward saying that, you know, Nibiru is a real issue and that
the government knows it.
G: Oh sure. Well, we know that Nibiru is... Well, my partner, Gillian,
knows all of that information on that and she can go into more detail
than I can. And so, well have to get her on the air with you and you
can discuss the whole thing.
K: That would be lovely. Thatd be wonderful. We definitely would love
to do that. OK. Is there any parting remarks? You know. And then we want
to call you back for a sort of a personal conversation, if you dont
mind. But before we do that, are there any other remarks that you want
to make about the current situation? Maybe words of advice to the Ground
Crew?
G: Well, the words I have right now is just what I said before: Get your
food stored up. If you need some appliances, go out and buy em while
you can buy em cheap right now, because my friends were telling me that
Chinas saying pay em in any other currency besides the dollar in order
to get the stuff. So Im going to see a lot of goods and stuff kind of
disappear off the shelves very shortly. And you might as well get it
while you can. Itd be for trading stock.
K: Right.
G: Food. And get yourself someplace that you can go, away from major
cities. Because I am getting a lot of calls from people right now, that
the military is doing some exercises in different places.
K: Right. We did get some information about that. Weve also got Bill
Deagle talking about H5N1 - its a virus.
G: The avian flu virus. Right.
K: Have you heard anything about that?
G: No, I didnt go into any details. Remember, when I sat in on the
meetings when they were looking to population reduction, they said: By
all means necessary. Thats viruses, too, because they were cheaper.
The new pulsed-beam weapons - the ones they developed off of alien
craft - theyre really looking at that, too. They can just basically
send out a beam and shut down all electronic things, and everything
else, and put you basically back in the Stone Age instantly.
K: Wow. OK.
G: Thats all available at this minute. But if theyre looking for
population reduction in order to try to keep ahold of what weve had as
the United States being the most powerful one, they want to try to keep
the economy going. I want to see how theyre going to try to unravel it
with the rest of the world leaders. Because theyre not buying it.
K: Oh, Im sure of it. What about... Theres one last thing, which is,
were hearing things about ships coming into port and not having letters
of credit, so theyre not able to deliver the goods.
G: The letter of credit was for the goods that youre talking about?
When they have the delivery, they come up and they cant get their cash.
Ive heard that also from a couple of other places. In other words, the
ships... You know, they were costing them about almost $40,000 a day for
fuel to run these things. But the prices are down.
But the goods they were delivering... They were given a letter of credit
that as soon as the boat, you know, came up, or unloaded whatever the
boat was loaded with, the letter of credit then would be funded. But the
banks are broke.
K: Right.
G: So what do they do? Then they go out to find somebody else to buy it.
And if they can, the people are buying it for 10-cents on the dollar.
Yeah, Ive heard that already. And theyre doing that like they do with
some of the real estate stuff theyre doing right now for 25- and
30-cents on the dollar. So yeah. [laughs] Its a big meltdown, Kerry.
Thats all you can look at.
K: Yeah, its pretty worldwide. Well, I think that youre also talking
about countries like Africa and the smaller, you know, small islands,
and places in the third world that are going to be hit the hardest, it
seems to me.
G: Well, look. These countries that youre talking about and other
things that are hit the hardest because of the benefits that weve been
putting out, in other words, trying to help the people.
K: They have no tourism, you know. A lot of these places arent going to
exist.
G: Look at what theyre doing right now in Vegas. Right now... Theres a
whole area right now - youve got hotel rooms for 30 bucks a night. I
mean, about 70 of em along the Strip.
K: Incredible.
G: Because theres nobody coming in there. You know, gambling has always
been good. My son-in-law was going to build a new casino, and they just
cancelled that.
K: Oh, did they?
G: Yeah. This is all in the last week, so hes going to be without a
job. And he just did a billion-dollar project and he was going to do
another billion-dollar one.
K: Very interesting. OK. Well, were going to be speaking at the Crash
Retrieval Conference coming up in Vegas, as you know.
G: On the 9th [of November]. Yeah, I know. Well be talking. Well do
that at another time.
K: Absolutely. OK. Well, were going to get back with you with a private
conversation here but thank you, George, for this update. Were going to
put this on our site.
G: Thanks, Kerry.
K: And we really do appreciate you, you know, staying in touch with us
and keeping us up to date on whats going on.
G: Well, I hope to see you both.
K: Absolutely. All right. Take care. Bye.
G: Bye.
