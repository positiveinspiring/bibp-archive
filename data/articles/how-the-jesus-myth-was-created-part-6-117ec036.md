Sixth page
Sumer
Religion was Handed Down by Extraterrestrials
This Awareness indicates that the
Christian religion drew from many different sources. The Hebrew religion was
basically its immediate parent, and yet evolving out of Hebrews teachings,
it also embraced other religions that went back even further. There was the
time of
Sumer, the great ancient culture that existed long
before Egypt, or
before the Hebrew, even before Caldea.
The Sumer religion was based on stories
handed down about extraterrestrials, and these entities coming down from heaven
or coming down from the sky, and the rules that were laid out for the creation
of mankind, when these extraterrestrials were involved in their genetic experiments,
creating the Cro-Magnon man.
This Awareness indicates that these
writings were preserved down through several subsequent cultures: Babylon,
Chaldean, and Akkadian, and on down, and eventually, many of these ancient
writings wound up with the Greek and the Hebrews, and even the
Egyptians,
and became part of their ancient legend or mythologies which are now called
religions.
Read Bramley's "The Gods of Eden" for info on Secret Schools
This Awareness indicates that if entities wish to know something about the so-called conspiracies of the secret Schools, this Awareness refers them to the Bramley book The Gods of Eden for these Secret Societies that were established by the extraterrestrials and filled with priests who were to help to mold the thinking and help to guide the culture of these ancient civilizations is well described in this book, The Gods of Eden, and there is little point in this Awareness going back over this material, for it can be better understood in reading that book.
The
ET's Set Up Secret Societies and priesthoods
This Awareness indicates, however,
that briefly, the extraterrestrials set up
Secret Societies with a secret
priesthood designed to help control and manipulate the societies through
religion,
ritual and concepts which, down through the ages has evolved without great
change, in a way that molded entities into the society which the extraterrestrials
foresaw and sought to promote on this physical plane.
The
meaning of the Hebrew Yod He Hin Vau Heh
This Awareness
indicates that the name Jesus in Hebrew is spelled Yod He Shin Vau
Heh. The name
Jehovah is Yod He Vau Heh. The "Shin" added to Jesus
represents the element Akasha. The Yod He, and Vau Heh, the letters on both
side of Shin represents Fire, Air, Water and Earth, and thus, Yod He Shin
Vau Heh represents a 5th element or that of Akasha which is the Divine Spirit.
This Awareness indicates that if
you wish, equate the Shin or Akasha as representing this Awareness consciousness,
the Cosmic Consciousness attribute of the Divine Creator. This Awareness indicates
that these of course are symbolized as personified beings and written of in
the ancient schools by priests as though they were persons, individuals, so
that in the case of the story of Christianity, all of these various entities
are drawn together and made to become one character. And the story surrounds
this entity's experience and his love of humanity.
This Awareness indicates that if there is that which you can refer to as a conspiracy, it would be in the way the churches have promoted Christianity for the purpose of raising money for their churches and whereby the, in some cases, have exploited others in the name of Jesus, or have butchered civilizations in the name of Jesus on the grounds that they were heathen, for Jesus would not have participated in or encouraged such butchery.
Deception in saying the Bible is "God's Word"
This Awareness indicates that there is still the other aspect of what may be termed deception in the Biblical stories. This in relation to the statements by many religious leaders that the Bible is "God's Word" and that God wrote the Bible. It is well understood when reading through Biblical passages and comparing to other earlier writings, that a great portion of the Bible has been lifted from earlier writings of other cultures.
Conspiracy When Justinian Removed Incarnation References
This Awareness indicates another area of what may be termed conspiracy or deception has to do with the action of Justinian, who took out references to reincarnation from the New Testament but did not manage to get everything and left certain areas, or certain phrases, that are clearly references to reincarnation. This has been discussed previously.
The Piso Family Who Wrote the Books of the New Testament
This Awareness indicates that still other earlier information on the deception in the New Testament has to do who really wrote the books of the New Testament. This Awareness indicates that much of the information was written by a family, the Piso family, and there is information about these entities and how they coded their own works so that they received credit for the writing, and you can find these coded references in the New Testament which fits with the code of the various writers of the Piso family. This as having spawned a society, a secret society that down through the ages has passed this information to various people and which can still be found, and information on this is available and has been mentioned previously, with an address given to allow entities to find more information on this family who wrote the new testament.
These entities having gone through certain competition with each other at one point, whereby their own family competition regarding who will do what, created between them the need to couch their material in certain codes and certain numerical properties to assure that they always got the credit for the particular book of the New Testament which they wrote.
Books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, Written by Pisos
This Awareness indicates, for example, the books of Matthew, Mark, and John were not written by Matthew, Mark and John, but by different Piso family members, all of which is explained in the material that they make available to the public by writing to them. These entities not alive today, but the society preserving this information is still very much alive.
This Awareness indicates that even the Book of Revelation was written by the Piso family. This Awareness indicates that entities who wish to check this further can write to the address, and for five dollars receive a small booklet that explains much more in detail in regard to this family. There is also the opportunity for entities to join a membership of this organization if they so desire.
This Awareness indicates that the important thing about the Christian religion is that the symbolism of the story has been a great influence on society, has been a glue to hold society together, to make it grow, to make it develop into that which held high ideals.
Bright, Glorious and Beautiful aspects of Christianity
Even though there have been dark sides of Christianity down through history, there are also the bright, glorious and beautiful aspects of this religion. This Awareness indicates that the majority of Christian adherents are as beautiful as any people on earth. There are some who detract from that beauty who are hostile, judgmental, even unworthy of their claim as Christians, but the majority are very beautiful people and their faith has helped many on this plane, and has served many and served them well.
This Awareness suggests the editor repeat the address for the Piso family information in this reading.*The True Authorship of the New Testament, by Abelard Reuchlin
