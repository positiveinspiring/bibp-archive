The
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation...
Exposed!
ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron,
DynCorp, G4S, Walmart and McDonald's
are just a few of the
companies that the mega 'charity' supports.
With an endowment larger than all
but four of the world's largest hedge funds, the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation is easily one of the most powerful 'charities' in the world.
According to its website, the organization,
"works to help all people lead healthy,
productive lives."
So how do the investments of the foundation's
$36 billion investing arm, the Gates Foundation Trust, match up to its
mission? We dug into the group's recently
released 2012 tax returns to find out.
The Gates Foundation did not respond to requests
for comment; however, its investment
policy says the the trust's managers,
"consider other issues beyond corporate
profits, including the values that drive the foundation's work."
In its most recent annual report to investors,
private prison company GEO group listed some risks to its bottom line,
including,
"reductions in crime rates" that "could lead
to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences," along with
immigration reform and the decriminalization of drugs.
Military contractor DynCorp, meanwhile, has
faced allegations of fraud, mismanagement,
and even slavery from
the Middle East to Eastern Europe.
