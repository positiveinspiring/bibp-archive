A NASA
study claims that after reviewing 7 years of drought in parts of the
Middle East, and poor management combined with increasing demands for ground
water have led to an exorbitant amount of water loss in the region.
As part of the
NASA
Gravity Recovery and Climate Expert (GRACE) researchers surmised
that Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran are losing massive amounts of fresh
groundwater at astronomical rates. An estimated 60% has been pumped out of
reservoirs and wells while lakes are in consistent decline.
According to the study:
This rate of water loss is among the
largest liquid freshwater losses on the continents.
Climate change and overpopulation are being
blamed as these countries face coming water shortages.
The increasing poverty in the region poses
critical problems to the Middle East and North Africa. Droughts caused by
man-made climate change are expected to become more extreme according to
alarmist scientists working with the UN.
Kate Voss, lead author of the study and a water
policy fellow with the University of Californias Center for Hydrological
Modeling, claims:
That decline in stream flow put a lot of
pressure on northern Iraq. Both the UN and anecdotal reports from area
residents note that once stream flow declined, this northern region of
Iraq had to switch to groundwater.
In an already fragile social,
economic and political environment, this did not help the situation.
McGill University published a study last year
that analyzed data from global ground water use against computer generated
models of underwater aquifers and concluded that the groundwater footprint
of reliable resources above ground is 3.5 times larger than the known
aquifers.
The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) document
HS
15332 Climate Change Impacts - Securitization of Water, Food, Soil,
Health, Energy and Migration explains how the UN plans to secure resources
to use at their disposal.
Through the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
under-developed countries are forced to sell their resources to
the global
Elite as full cost recovery to the
global central bankers.
Once those
resources are under the
complete control of the IMF they become assets to be reallocated back to the enslaved nations for
a price.
This scheme makes water sources under central
privatization cost more and become less accessible to those who desperately
need it. Water prices rise while the quality of it diminishes. This forces
natives in places like South Africa and India to collect water from polluted
streams and rivers, which compromises their health.
The cycle in complete
when those who had their water stolen from them through coercion die from
contaminated water that they were forced to use.
In 2007, the IPCC
stated that,
higher temperatures and decreased
precipitation have contributed to changes in drought.
The British Geological Survey and the University
College London have
surveyed African underground aquifers and concluded that there are more
than 100 times the amount of water found underground than on the surface of
the continent.
Andrew Mitchell, the United Kingdoms Secretary
of State for International Development is delighted by this find.
This is an important discovery. This
research, which the British Government has funded, could have a profound
effect on some of the worlds poorest people.
This discovery could become the largest attempt
at water privatization.
Water resources worldwide have
succumbed to
privatization, turning lifes most essential molecule into a global
commodity. The
securitization of water is a conflict of control over society and the
right to life. It is a non-negotiable aspect of life on Earth.
The false
flag threat of water pollution (which is being committed by the global Elite
through multi-national corporations) is a cover story for the march toward
complete control over all basic necessities required to live.
Precipitation levels and drought have been
correlated by alarmist scientists to explain agricultural conditions that
have been changing without long term studies to prove emphatically that the
two are conditional upon each other.
Five years later, the IPCC published a
study that explained that
droughts have many different factors involved and narrowing down the blame
on climate change is not apparent; although they maintain that
'man-made'
global warming will cause an intensification of those effects.
Alarmist scientists are claiming that global
warming is causational to the deterioration of public health, farming
conditions, and the draining of the Great Lakes. This
report was commissioned by the
US government by way of 13 agencies working under the US Global Change
Research Program (GCRP).
GCRP states that human activity, primarily
fossil fuel usage, is responsible for climate change for the last 50 years.
As a result, temperatures have heated up since the Industrial Revolution
with a culmination revealing itself in recent years which demands a
reaction.
Experiments conducting last year by the United
Arab Emirates (UAE), successfully
manufactured fifty rainstorms by scientists using large ionizers to
generate negatively charged particle fields.
These structures promote cloud
formation. Metro Systems International (MSI), the technology purveyors,
claims to have achieved a number of rainfalls.
MSI scientists use ionizers to negatively charge
electrons that naturally attract specks of dust in the atmosphere. Using
convection, these particles are carried upward on air currents can become
clouds at the right height. The electrons will attract water molecules from
the air and condense them. With enough water collected, the cloud can
create rain.
This privately owned Swiss corporation's,
"focused on providing a rain enhancement
service to increase the supply of fresh water in arid regions of the
world.
The globalist-controlled Max Planck Institute
for Meteorology (MPM) was involved in the MSI experiments to create rain.
MPM attributes industrialization, rising need
for more resources due to population growth and greenhouse emissions to the
current state of our planet and
seeks to
use scientific methods to manipulate our atmosphere to create their desired
effect - to alter the climate so that the variations created will change
weather patterns worldwide.
The Earthsystem Model (ESM)
developed by MPM studies atmospheric-ocean systems with hypothesis
tested and the integration of simulating natural weather patterns.
MSI is collaborating with meteorological
scientists and researching and development projects for governments across
the globe in order to fabricate rainstorms using Weathertec projects.
Weathertec has been around since 2010 wherein 50
rainstorms complete with thunder and lightning were created in Abu Dhabi
where rainfall is scarce. This $11
project is an innovative rainfall enhancement technology.
MSI, working with the Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed
Al Nahyan, president of the UAE, embarked on the rain-making experiment by
manipulating electrons with ionizers.
