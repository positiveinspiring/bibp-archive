Pentagons cutting
edge research lab says that
theyve used a massive
harvest of tobacco plants
to help produce a plethora of
flu-fighting vaccines.
The Pentagons
DARPA lab has announced a milestone, but it
doesnt involve drones or death missiles.
Scientists at the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency say theyve produced 10 million doses of an influenza
vaccine in only one months time. In a press release out of the agencys
office this week, scientists with DARPA say theyve reach an important step
in being able to combat a flu pandemic that might someday decimate the
Earths population.
By working with the
Medicago Inc. vaccine company, the
Pentagons cutting edge research lab says that theyve used a massive
harvest of tobacco plants to help produce a plethora of flu-fighting
vaccines.
Testing confirmed that a single dose of the
H1N1 VLP influenza vaccine candidate induced protective levels of
hemagglutinin antibodies in an animal model when combined with a
standard aluminum
adjuvant, the agency writes, while
still noting, though, that the equivalent dose required to protect
humans from natural disease can only be determined by future,
prospective clinical trials.
Researchers have before relied on using chicken
eggs to harvest compounds to use in influenza vaccines.
With a future outbreak requiring scientists to
step up with a solution as soon as possible, though, theyve turned to
tobacco plants to help produce the vaccines.
Vaccinating susceptible populations during
the initial stage of a pandemic is critical to containment, Dr. Alan
Magill, DARPA program manager, says in an official statement.
Were looking at plant-based solutions to
vaccine production as a more rapid and efficient alternative to the
standard egg-based technologies, and the research is very promising.
The World Health Organization has gone on
the record to say that as much as half of the people on the planet could be
affected by a pandemic in the near future, and it could take as much as nine
months for a vaccine for a pandemic virus strain to become made available.
With the lives of billions of people across the
world at stake, DARPA has been trying to determine new ways of churning out
antidotes in as little time as possible.
Now its researchers say, that in only a month,
scientists,
produced more than 10 million doses (as
defined in an animal model) of an H1N1 influenza vaccine candidate based
on virus-like particles (VLP).
Through DARPAs previously established Blue
Angel program (below insert), researchers have spent several years
searching for new ways to produce mass quantities of vaccine-grade protein
that could be used to combat what they say are very real emerging and novel
biological threats.
Andy Sheldon, Chief Executive Officer of Medicago , says in the
companys own press release that
"The completion of the rapid fire test marks
a substantial achievement in demonstrating our technology and the
potential for Medicago to be the first responder in the event of a
pandemic flu outbreak.
Medicagos research was conducted in a
97,000-square-foot vaccine facility in North Carolina that was funded
through a $21 million Technology Investment Agreement with DARPA.
