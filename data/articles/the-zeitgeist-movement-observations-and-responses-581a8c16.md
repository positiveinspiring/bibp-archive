PREFACE
The
Zeitgeist Movement is the activist arm of
The
Venus Project, which constitutes the life long work of industrial
designer and social engineer, Jacque Fresco. Jacque currently lives in
Venus, Florida, working closely with his associate, Roxanne Meadows.
Now,
let it be understood that Mr. Fresco will be the first to tell you that his
perspectives and developments are not entirely his own, but rather uniquely
derived from the evolution of scientific inquiry which has persevered since
the dawn of antiquity.
Simply put, what The Venus Project represents and
what The Zeitgeist Movement hence condones, could be summarized as:
'The application of The Scientific Method
for social concern.'
Through the humane application of Science and Technology to social design
and decision-making, we have the means to transform our tribalistic,
scarcity driven, corruption filled environment into something exceedingly
more organized, balanced, humane, sustainable and productive.
To do so, we
have to understand who we are, where we are, what we have, what we want, and
how we are going to obtain our goals.
Given the current state of affairs,
many of which will be addressed in the first part of this book, the reader
should find that we not only need to move in another direction
we have to.
The current economic system is falling apart at an accelerating rate, with
the prospect of worldwide unemployment occurring on the largest scale ever
seen.
Simultaneously, we are courting the "point of no return" in regard to
the destruction of the environment.
Our current methods of social conduct have proven to have no chance in
resolving the problems of environmental destruction, human conflict,
poverty, corruption and any other issue that reduces the possibility of
collective human sustainability on our planet. It is time we grow up as a
species and really examine what the true problems and solutions are, as
uncomfortable, untraditional and foreign as they might seem.
This work will first present the current economic problems we face,
recognizing root causes, consequences and inevitabilities, while then
presenting solutions derived from an assessment of what is actually relevant
to life and society. Additionally, information will be provided as to how
each one of us can help in this challenge, presenting methods of
communication and activism that will hopefully speed up the process of
transformation.
It is very important that those who begin this work pause for a moment and
think about the windows of perspective they have been indoctrinated into.
Considering the current vastness of human values and ideologies, coupled
with the identification that grows over time with associations to a
particular train of thought, tradition or notion of reality, it can be
difficult and even painful for a person to revise or remove the cherished
understandings which they have considered true for long periods of time.
This 'ego' association, coupled with the perpetual state of
'limited
knowledge' each one of us has, will be the biggest hurdle many will face
when reading the information presented here. It is time to broaden our
loyalties and affiliations beyond the narrow confines of the marketplace,
tradition, and the nation-state to encompass the human species as a whole,
along with the planetary environment that supports us all.
It is time we
view the earth as an indivisible organic whole, a living entity composed of
countless forms of life, all brought together in a single community.
If nature has taught us only one thing, it is that the only constant is
change.
There is no such thing as a Utopia. Therefore, in order for us to
grow productively as a species, we need to become experts at "changing our
minds" about anything and everything.
If you choose to approach this
material with a conscious attempt at being open minded and objective, we
feel the ideas expressed here will realign your vision of the world,
yourself, and the future of our human family in a way that is the most
productive, humane and effective.
Part 1
Monetary Economics
Chapter 1: Mechanisms & Consequences
Defining our terms
The term "Economics" is generally defined as 'the social science that
studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services'
1.
As of the early 21st century the prevailing mechanism of virtually all
economies worldwide is some form of "Monetary System". A Monetary System
uses an intermediary exchange medium, known as 'money', as the means for
facilitating employment, production, distribution, and the consumption of
goods and services. The use of this medium of monetary exchange, as a basis
for an economic system, could be termed: "Monetary Economics".
While virtually no nation on the planet currently uses anything else but
Monetary Economic Theory in its country's operations, certain variations are
indeed present. Generally speaking, these variations have to do with the
degree by which the system is controlled by the government of a country.
The
current 'sliding scale', moving from more regulation to less regulation,
typically,
-
starts with
"Communism" (maximum state control)
-
passes through Socialism (partial state
control)
-
ends at Capitalism (little to no state control)
These
variations of economic application could be termed "Social Systems".
The prevailing Social System of the world today is Capitalism.
Capitalism,
which is often placed under the umbrella of another theoretical concept
known as the "Free Market", is defined as: "an economic system by which the
means of production are owned by private persons, operated for profit, and
where investments, distribution, income, production and pricing of goods and
services are predominantly determined through the operation of a 'free
market' 2."
A "Free market" is essentially an unregulated trading orientation where "the
prices of goods and services are arranged completely by the mutual consent
of sellers and buyers; hence, the market forces of supply and demand
determine prices and allocate available supplies, without government
intervention" 3.

its historically applied form, not the idealized forms which advocate no
money.
2 en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism
3 en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market The evolution, application and
interpretation of Economics are staggeringly large bodies of material with
endless debate. It is not in the interest of this manual to present a
treatise on the whole of Economics. In fact, a partial basis of this manual
is to
show how, through the advent of Technology and the elimination of Scarcity,
99% of all economic theory is now an outdated and irrelevant practice.
There are also even more subjective forms of value that are demographic
specific, where certain "brands" create prices
(projected value) not based on tangible human labor or material value, but
on the "status identity" of the item itself, as perceived by the consumer
culture. This is a less relevant form of "economic value" and will be
discussed more so in the section entitled: "Distortion of Values" later in
the Chapter. Also, financial instrument values, such as issues traded on the
stock market are also irrelevant, in and of themselves, when it comes to
actual production and distribution.
The notion of "Free market" has many interpretations and
schools of thought. For example, one of the more extreme, yet currently
active ideologies is the "Austrian School", which condones the notion of "laissez-faire" which basically means having literally no state intervention
on economic issues at all. In this perspective, "welfare" and other state
sponsored 'social' programs
would be considered inappropriate.
Now, general terminology aside, a very relevant attribute of Monetary
Economics is the "Theory of Value".
The level of a product or service's 'value' is derived essentially from two factors :
-
The scarcity
(availability) of the materials used
-
The amount of human labor required to
produce a product/service
For instance: Imagine the amount of time and effort it would take to create
a simple shirt before the advent of electricity and advanced industrial
technology. The overall process might be to: prepare the soil - plant the
cotton seed - oversee the growth period - pick the cotton - tease out the
seed - spin the cotton into thread - weave it into the cloth - and shape
the cloth into shirt form.
Given the above scenario, simply from a human labor standpoint, the value of
that shirt would be relatively high and likely sold for a price respective
of the extensive labor. The cotton seed (component material) value would be
negligible as it is produced as a byproduct of the prior harvest, making its
scarcity value very low.
Therefore, the real value of this shirt comes from
the labor involved.
Now, hypothetically speaking, what if this production process required no
human labor at all, while the cotton seed/water/sunlight/soil maintained its
natural abundance? What would the value of that shirt be then?
Obviously, it
really wouldn't have a value at all.
As of the start of the 21st century, Industrial Machines have taken the role
of planting and harvesting
agricultural products to the effect where one lone farmer can now work 1000+
acres of land on his/her own. The advent of textile equipment, such as the
Cotton Gin dramatically reduced human effort, while with the modern use of
industrial computerization, we are seeing a constant gravitation to the near
full automation of the Agricultural and Textile Industries, among many
others.
The point is that the position of "Economic Value", as a seemingly
static economic notion, is now being overhauled by this technological
influence (increasing ease of production/material abundance), which could,
theoretically, eliminate the notion of 'value' entirely.
When human labor is reduced/displaced by technology and automation, the
assumed 'value', which is to equate that 'labor' to 'price', drops
respectively. The 'value' of the output would then move to the
creation/maintenance of the machinery, which now serves as the role of
laborers. Consequently, the more efficient, durable and sustainable these
worker machines are, the further the 'Value' of the production drops.
The realization is that the pattern of machine automation, coupled with
modern innovations that are finding substitutions for "scarce" resources,
could lead us into a position where no good or service would require a "value" or price tag. It simply wouldn't make any theoretical sense. For
most, this is a very difficult thing to consider, due to what we are used to
experiencing in our everyday lives.
Regardless of your opinion, the fact is,
the pattern of constant technological improvement coupled with automated
machinery can theoretically create an economic environment where the
abundance of materials and production mediums are so high and efficient,
most humans will have little need to 'purchase' anything, let alone 'work
for a living', in the traditional sense.
More specifically, even if machines
slowly displaced only a large minority of people, expanding unemployment,
the ramifications would be systemic, and the entire economic system would
grow more and more unstable and inoperable. This issue will be expanded upon
in Chapters 2 and 5.
That point aside for now, let's examine some empirical
mechanisms that Monetary Economics, specifically in the context of
Capitalism, requires in order to maintain the integrity of the system.
In
the remaining sections of this chapter, we will discuss the 5 most
foundational attributes needed for maintaining the system, the reasoning
behind them, and their consequences.
Mechanism One -
The Need for Cyclical Consumption
The roles of people in a monetary system are basically broken into three
distinctions:
-
The Employee
-
The Consumer
-
The Employer (or Owner/Producer)
There is also the Investor who gives fiscal support to an
Employer/Owner/Producer, or trades in the Financial markets for gain. This
isn't relevant to the context for an investor is not required to exist in
order for the market system to operate.
The Employee performs tasks for the Employer in exchange for a "Wage" or
monetary payment, while the employer sells a good or service to the Consumer
for a "Profit"- another classification of monetary payment. In turn, both
the Employer and Employee function as Consumers, for the monetary payments
("wages" and "profits") they obtain are used to purchase goods and services
relevant to their survival.
The act of purchasing goods and services, which
is the role of the Consumer, is what allows the Employer to make its
"Profit", while also enabling the payment of the Employee's "Wage".
In other words, it is the requirement of perpetual 'Consumption' that keeps
the Employer in business and maintains the Employee's job.
Now, it is important to understand that this payment-consumption cycle (or
'cyclical consumption') cannot stop, or the entire economic structure would
collapse, for money would not come to the Employer, the Employer would not
be able to afford to pay his Employee, and both the Employer and Employee
would not be able to perpetuate the cycle by being a Consumer.
Consequence:
-
Nothing physically produced can ever maintain an operational lifespan
longer than what can be endured in order to maintain economic integrity
through 'cyclical consumption'.
In other words, every 'good' produced must breakdown in a respective amount
of time in order to continue financial circulation to support the players
(consumer/employee/employer) in the game. This characteristic could be
defined as: "Planned Obsolescence".
Planned Obsolescence can generally take two positions: a) Intentional:
Deliberate withholding of efficiency so the product in question breaks down.
b) Consequential: Profit based shortcuts taken in production, usually in the
form of cheap
materials/poor design, in an effort to save money and create repeat
customers. This translates into an inferior product immediately.
[i.e. = The use of plastics for electronic enclosures is cheaper for the
company and the consumer, but the durability of this material is poor in
comparison to say, titanium metal, which is much more expensive.]
-
The introduction of new products and services must be constant to offset
any increased efficiency of the prior generations of production, regardless
of functional utility, generating endless waste.
In other words, waste is a deliberate byproduct of industry's need to keep
'cyclical consumption' going. This means that the replaced/obsolete product
is expelled, often to landfills, polluting the environment. The constant
multiplicity accelerates the pollution.
'The Need for Cyclical Consumption', which could be considered the
'engine'
that powers the entire economic system, is inherently dangerous and corrupt,
for the nature of the necessity does not allow for environmentally
sustainable practices to be maximized.
The constant re-creation of inferior
products wastes available resources and pollutes the environment.
To express this from a different angle, imagine the economic ramifications
of production methods that strategically maximized the efficiency and
sustainability of every creation, using the best-known materials and
techniques available at that time. Imagine a car that was so well designed,
it didn't need maintenance for 100 years.
Imagine a house that was built
from fireproof materials where all appliances, electrical operations,
plumbing and the like were made from the most impermeable, highest integrity
resources available on earth.
In such a saner world, where we actually
created things to last, inherently minimizing pollution/waste due to the
lack of multiplicity and maximization of efficiency, a monetary system would
be impossible, for 'consumption cyclically' would slow tremendously, forever
weakening so called "economic growth".
Mechanism Two
The Abundance of Scarcity In Monetary Economics, the notion of "Supply and
Demand" is a well-known construct, simply denoting that 'the more there is
of something, the less it is worth in respect to itself''.
For example,
drinking water was historically a very abundant resource, which didn't
typically require payment for its consumption in a commercial sense.
However, as pollution of the water table and city water systems have
developed, filtered drinking water is now being commercially sold, often at
a higher price than oil per gallon. In other words, it is profitable for
resources to be scarce.
If a company can convince the public that their
product is "rare", the more they can charge for that product. This provides
a strong motivation to keep their items scarce. On yet another level, it
should be pointed out that the central banks of nearly all countries also
create scarcity within the money supply itself in order to keep pressure on
the market system.
Bernard Lietaer, designer of the EU currency system
points out:
"Greed and Competition are not the result of immutable human
temperament
greed and fear of scarcity are in fact being continuously
created and amplified as a direct result of the kind of money we are
using
We can produce more than enough food to feed everybody
but there is
clearly not enough money to pay for it all.
The scarcity is in our national currencies.
In fact, the job of the central banks is to create and maintain that
currency scarcity. The direct consequence is that we have to fight with
each other in order to survive." 4
4 Lietaer, Bernard "Beyond Greed and Scarcity". Yes Magazine 1997 For the
sake of simplicity, the term 'profit' is going to be used here as synonymous
with 'income' and 'wage'. While the classical economic classifications
separate these notions, these terms simply refer to the acquisition of
money. The wage earner 'profits' from his work, for it is just income, very
simply.
The ramifications of this abundance of scarcity are nothing but detrimental.
If profit can be made as a result of scarcity generated by environmental
pollution, then this creates a sick reinforcement of indifference to
environmental concern. If companies know they can make more money by having
their resources or products remain scarce, how can a world of abundance ever
occur? It can't, for the corporation will be motivated to create the
scarcity if need be.
In turn, the scarcity created in the money supply
itself by the central banks compounds the motivation for us to compete with
each other, generating an ethic-less, primitive tribalism with everyone out
for themselves, producing human stress, conflict and illness.
Mechanism Three -
The Priority of Profit
A monetary system's foremost motivating principle is Profit, or the
acquisition of money through the exploitation of others. All players in the
game must, in order to survive, seek out a strategy to acquire income.
A
"wage" earner seeks out the best possible pay he can get for his services,
while the Employer (owner/producer) seeks to constantly reduce costs in
order to maximize profit. This is the dominant "mentality" in a Monetary
System and those who are in positions of great wealth (material "success")
are often the most ruthless.
While many people who favor the profit system
will talk endlessly about their "ethical" standards in regard to their
practices, history has shown that the priority of profit is actually a
sickness which is not only poisoning our personal/social well-being and
standards of living, but also the environment on which we rely for virtually
everything we need as a species.
However, before we begin with the negative consequences resulting from this
'mentality', let us consider what many think to be the good side of this
profit priority "Incentive".
As the theory goes, the need for profit provides a person/organization with
motivation to work on new ideas/products that would sell in the market
place. In other words, the assumption is that if people were not motivated
by their need to survive through profit, little social progress would be
achieved.
First of all, the most powerful contributions to society did not come from
corporations seeking profit. Nikola Tesla did not establish alternating
current electric power because he was out to make a buck. Louis Pasteur,
Charles Darwin, the Wright Brothers, Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton did
not make their massive contributions to society because of material
self-interest.
While it is true that useful inventions and methods do come
from the motivation for personal gain, the intent behind those creations
typically have nothing to do with human or social concerns, for detached
self-interest and survival are really the true motivations.
Profit interest almost always comes before human concern, and a simple
glance at the cancer causing preservatives in our foods, the planned
obsolescence of nearly everything manufactured, along with a health care
industry that charges $300 for a single antibiotic pill, will indicate that
'Profit Based Incentive' is actually detrimental, for the true incentive is
not to contribute to society in a meaningful way, but merely to exact wealth
from it in any way possible. Profit is actually a false incentive.
Problems
in our monetary based society will only have a resolution if profit can be
made from solving those problems.
Consequence:
The psychological/sociological ramifications resulting from the priority of
profit are of grave proportions when it comes to the conduct of human
beings. In fact, an entire structure of imposed control has been created in
order to deal with the never-ending problems associated with the need for
survival by way of gain/profit/income - The Legal System.
While non-monetary
related crimes, often born from ego, jealousy, emotional deprivation and
other psychological issues are currently a problem, the frequency of
non-monetary related crimes are nothing in comparison to the crimes
committed that are motivated by the acquisition of money and property.
In
fact, if we define "Crime" as 'Corruption' and define "Corruption" as "Moral
Perversion; Dishonesty", then an entirely new perspective comes into play,
for, if you look closely enough, you will see that nearly every act of
strategic monetary gain is corrupt by its very construct
it is just accepted
as 'normal' by the conditioned culture to whatever degree is deemed
tolerable by consensus.
For example, when you go to the grocery store and buy a box of cereal, 9/10
times the amount of cereal occupies only 60% of the space within the box.
This 'advertising strategy' as the producing company would call it, is
actually just a blatant, wasteful lie. The advertising agencies, with all of
their tactics of social manipulation, are likely one of the most corrupt
institutions on the planet. Sadly, we have been conditioned to call it 'promotion' or
'strategy' instead. More on the social distortion created by
advertising will be presented in the "Distortion of Values" section of this
chapter.
Now, to put the spectrum of monetary derived corruption into a workable
perspective, we will divide this aberrant behavior into 3 classifications:
General Crime Corporate Crime Government Crime.
General crime, as derived from the pursuit of money, ranges from petty theft
to illegal sales to fraud to violent robbery. This byproduct of the monetary
system is often not given the thought needed to understand its source, for
many tend to dismiss these "criminals" as some kind of social anomaly,
rather than relating their basis to the need to survive. The inherent stress
and other side effects associated with deprivation are also overlooked.
The 'Merva-Fowles' study, done at the University of Utah in the 1990s, found
powerful connections between unemployment and crime. They based their
research on 30 major metropolitan areas with a total population of over 80
million.
Their findings found that a 1% rise in unemployment resulted in: a 6.7%
increase in Homicides; a 3.4 % increase in violent crimes; a 2.4 % increase
in property crime.
During the period from 1990 to 1992, this translated into:
-
1459 additional
Homicides
-
62,607 additional violent crimes
-
223,500 additional property
crimes.5
If you were to take a well-to-do, ethical, 'stand-up' person, strip them of
their wealth and resources and drop them into a poor city with nothing but
the shirt on their back, there is a very high probability that this person
will begin to lie, cheat and steal in order to survive. It is no surprise
that the poorest neighborhoods in the United States maintain the highest
crime rates.
A person born into a deprived environment, with little
resources, poor education and few opportunities for work will do what they
need to do in order to live. The point here is that economic depravity
(scarcity), not so called genetic "criminal tendencies", creates this kind
of aberrant behavior.
Corporate Crime, which is almost always exclusively profit related, takes
many forms:
...are just a few to note.
From Enron's deliberate shutting down of
California's Power Plants to boost its Energy stocks 6, to the Bayer
Corporation's knowing distribution of HIV tainted drugs 7, it should be clear
to most people that
corporate crime is constant and often times more
insidious than "General Crime", for the repercussions tend to affect very
large
groups of people.

Stress, Economic Policy Institute, 1992

The "Corporate Criminal's" need to secure a business's profitability is no
different in basis than the "General Criminal's" need to survive. While the
latter typically commits crimes to live, the former commits crimes to
further secure their positions of power, lifestyle and wealth. It is based
on fear.
The notion of "Greed", which manifests from a perpetual insecurity
derived from the fear of losing what one has, serves as the motivating
factor for most corporate crimes. It is like a gambling addiction.
The more
you get, the more you want. This neurosis is perpetuated/reinforced by the
social stratification that the monetary system creates, for there is a
never-ending progression of "luxuries" available as one's purchasing power
increases (i.e.: mansions, yachts, limos, diamonds, land, etc).
More on this
will be addressed in the next section: "The Distortion of Values".
Government Crime is one of the more complex and difficult forms of conduct
to consider, for perception of government is highly modified by the
prevailing values this "ruling class" perpetuates through society, via the
mass media and traditional jingoism. In other words, if we look back at the
horrors of Hitler, many often forget that many of the German people also
maintained the anti-Semitic value system, propagated by the regime through
pamphlets and broadcasts.
The same can be said for the US Invasion of Iraq,
which was fueled initially by public support, simply because of the hate and
fear of so called "Islamic terrorists", generated by the attacks of
September 11th 2001. That being said, let's put aside our traditionalized
values of loyalty and "patriotism" and take an objective look at what
government within a Monetary System actually is and represents.
First of all, all members of government must be paid a wage and all projects
they devise must have funding. This money apparently comes from "Taxes"
imposed on the public, or loans from banks or other governments.
Taxes are
generated through 'commerce' or 'income from commerce', while loans must be
paid back with money manifested in some way either through more commerce,
more loans, or more taxes, theoretically.
The central role of government is the invention of regulatory legislation to
handle the functioning of society. Idealistically, the broad interests of
the public would be the first priority of government. Unfortunately, as
history has shown, this is not, and has rarely been, the case. Rather,
government as we know it is actually a 'parent' corporation to all the other
corporations working within the country's economy.
This, of course, makes
sense for the value of any nation is really determined by the state of its
economy. This means the government has a '"Vested Interest" in the economic
state of its nation, most specifically an interest in those within its own
class - the rich upper class. "Vested interest" or a person or group having
something to gain or lose by a governmental decision is a two way street.
A
politician can gain monetary 'contributions' from a company he favors in his
rulings, while the company thus gains from the rulings made in favor of
itself. Lobbying and Contributions in America constitute Billions of dollars
a year and this money is given entirely under the pretense of putting the
donating parties "agenda in action".
While the examples of government and corporate collusion are vast, ranging
from,
-
the passing of untested pharmaceuticals by the FDA
-
the oil lobby's
success in reverting the California Zero Emissions Law which forced the
clean running 'electric' cars into reclusion
-
the greatest monetarily derived crime of
government is its use of War for the benefit of it
corporate/financial constituents
In the words of Two-Time Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient, Major
General Smedley D. Butler:
"War is a racket. It always has been. It is
possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It
is
the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits
are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives. A racket is best described,
I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the
people. Only a small "inside" group knows what it is about. It is conducted
for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war
a few people make huge fortunes
In the World War [I] a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict. At
least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United
States during the World War
The Sixty-Fifth Congress, reporting on
corporate earnings and government revenues.
Considering the profits of,
-
122
meat packers
-
153 cotton manufacturers
-
299 garment makers
-
49 steel plants
-
340 coal producers
...during the war.
Profits under 25 per cent were
exceptional. For instance, the coal companies made between 100 per cent and
7,856 per cent on their capital stock during the war. The Chicago packers
doubled and tripled their earnings.
And let us not forget the bankers who financed the Great War. If anyone had
the cream of the profits, it was the bankers. Being partnerships, rather
than incorporated organizations, they do not have to report to stockholders.
And their profits were as secret as they were immense.
How the bankers made their millions and
their billions I do not know, because those little secrets never become
public even before a Senate investigatory body." 8
World War II, The Korean War, Vietnam and now Iraq and Afghanistan are no
different.
Accelerated industrial creation, military contracts,
reconstruction contracts, energy/resource acquisition (theft), high interest
austerity driven
World Bank and private bank loans for post war economies,
and even drug trafficking by the CIA 9, are just a few of the highly
profitable mediums.
8 Butler, Smedley D., War is a Racket, Feral House, 1935, Chapter 1
9 Webb,
Gary, Dark Alliance, Seven Story Press, 1999
The motivation for war is three fold.
-
Industrial Profit, maximized for
the elite
-
Resource Acquisition (theft)
-
Geopolitical Alignment to
increase the ease of further industrial profit and resource theft
This is one of the greatest sicknesses caused by the need for wealth and
power.
Government, with its team of brainwashed assassins on hand, is
involved in the ultimate form of self-preservation, and as long as all the
resources of the world remain 'hoarded' for the interest of a few, this
pattern of War will never end.
Now, the above classifications of "corruption" are only a generalized
grouping. Vast nuances of human behavior in everyday life are also very much
poisoned by this mechanism for profit; dishonesty, ranging from the 'art of
negotiation' where two business people compete with each other for their own
self-interest, with an inherent disregard for the other, to the disharmony
built into the employer-employee relationship, where one wants to maximize
labor to reduce hourly wages paid, while the other seeks to maximize time
spent in order to gain more income.
The bottom line is that The Priority of Profit sets up an 'us against them'
duality mentality, for, within the monetary system, there has to be a
buyer-seller; a worker-employer; a client-owner; a have-have not.
Given this
reality, each party is forced to enable conditions that are most profitable
for them, therefore strategic edges are always sought and thus a constant
battle is always raging. We are constantly at war with each other in order
to live.
This battle creates little over time in the way
of sustainable human progress, and the sick, polluted, distorted world you
see around you is the result.
Mechanism Four -
The Distortion of Values
Our Beliefs and Values are shaped by culture. While there is a genetic basis
to certain human attributes and behaviors, the knowledge we have and the way
we think about and act upon that knowledge is fundamentally an environmental
phenomenon.
With that in mind, the monetary system requires a form of communication to
inform the public of what a company has made available for sale. This form
of communication is termed 'advertising'.
The characteristic of advertising
is 'promotion' and promotion is a manner of communication, which, generally
speaking, creates a bias in favor of the product in question. In other
words, advertising's job is to entice
or in more direct terms manipulate
the consumer into purchasing a product. This manipulation takes many forms,
but one of the most effective is the manipulation and/or exploitation of the
viewing audience's "values" - what he or she finds important.
However, before we go any further, it needs to be pointed out that the mass
consumption patterns currently seen in the United States and elsewhere were
not always the case. America originally was founded, to some degree, on a
kind of Protestant work ethic, where thrift and savings were dominant
values. However, by the early 20th century, a concerted effort by the
business community set out to distort these notions and mold a new army of
impulsive, perpetually dissatisfied, status conscious consumers.
Advertising
agencies switched their arguments from utilitarian ones to those gauged for
emotional appeal and status. Consequently, today the average American
consumes twice as much as he or she did since the end of WWII.10
10 Schor, Juliet, The Overworked American, New York Books, 1991, p. 208
Now, one of the most powerful forms of 'value manipulation' comes from
re-associating a person's identity to a particular ideal. Patriotism and
Religion are classical examples of this, for through indoctrination at an
early age, a person is often conditioned to feel a close personal connection
to a country or religion, hence conditioning that person to want to support
the doctrines, unconditionally.
Another example of this is the concept of "fashion". Fashion takes many
forms, from the clothes people wear to even the ideologies they perpetuate.
To illustrate how successful the commercial industry has become in
manipulating the values of human beings for their own gain, many people
today can be seen walking around wearing certain commercial articles, merely
for the purpose of expressing a company's brand, contriving some kind of
apparent social status or "stylistic expression" from them.
Signature "Tommy
Hilfiger" shirts, trade marked "Prada Bags" and flashy Rolex watches are
examples of products where the utility or function of an item has lost total
relevance, with importance now derived by what the item "represents".
Sadly, what these people often do not realize is that they are nothing more
than walking advertisements for the respective company, plain and simple.
The "status" or "expression" really exists entirely in the conditioned 'value projections' of that person, and if enough people become manipulated
in the same way, a "trend" emerges, which further reinforces the delusion by
way of collective identification. These trends can become so powerful, that
those who do not adhere to the fad, might be deemed "outcasts" and be
ostracized.
Now, 'Vanity' aside, we must also examine the distorted values created in
the form of mentalities and worldviews. This constant need of self-interest
often spreads like a cancer into other psychological areas, creating and
reinforcing such neurosis as "Greed", "Jealousy" and "Ego".
Greed is likely the driving force of the monetary system's perpetuation,
beyond just survival.
Due to the inherent stratification of goods and
services (and hence standards of living) available to those with more and
more purchasing power, the human being is groomed to perpetually want "more"
material wealth, for the "more" seems to go to infinity. The result is a
culture which doesn't have a concept of balance, or a sense of what is
actually important, or "enough".
Advertising compounds
this by its constant depictions of "the possibilities", often making people
question their own self worth because they do not "have the best things in
life", etc.
Jealousy appears to begin cultivation at a very early age, perhaps when the
school teacher would praise the student who would make high marks, and scold
the student who didn't, making that student feel envious of the person who
made the high grade.
Regardless of its origin, a classic tactic of
advertising is to exploit this neurosis by using the media to depict a
person with something that you do not have, making you feel as though you
need to have it in order to be "equal". This is very similar to greed, with
the exception being that people grow to despise others for what they have,
creating social tension and often conflict.
Ego is often defined as 'a feeling of superiority to others'.
This
distortion takes essentially two forms:
-
General superiority based on
wealth class / or position in the social hierarchy
-
Arrogance regarding one's creative
contribution, demanding prestige, acknowledgement or other "rewards"
The latter, for many, almost seems "natural", for people today love to
"take
credit" for their ideas and inventions.
This has a strong reinforcement in
the monetary system, for when it comes to making a "profit", one is
literally being "rewarded" and "acknowledged" for their personal inventions
and actions. This further compounds the propensity for a person to demand
credit for what they do, even if it has nothing to do with money. It should
be pointed out that no human really "invents" or creates anything on his or
her own. Every idea and creation that has emerged has been done so based on
the contributions of prior generations' work, environmental influences
and/or peer feedback.
As Isaac Newton once said:
"If I have seen further, it is only by
standing on the shoulders of Giants" 11.
11 Newton, Isaac, Letter to Robert Hooke February 5th 1675
His point was that he
built his research, and hence discoveries, upon the work of many other great
scientists who lived before him. His credit therefore is not only his, it
goes to the whole body of scientific discovery that he had learned and
worked with.
This form of Ego has no position when a person understands that ALL
inventions and creations are actually collaborations developed serially, one
way or another.
Now, as for the former distinction of Ego noted above ("General superiority
based
") this is a class oriented disposition which, on one level, is a
psychological means to make one feel better for having more than another
human. A wealthy person walking down the street finds it much easier to
dismiss a homeless person, by saying "he is just a lazy bum", as opposed to
recognizing him as a victim of
culture.
On another level, blind elitism, in the form of a kind of
'class
based racism' leads people to dismiss those with less purchasing power as
simply being "inferior" or "undeserving", for the social stature, education
and lifestyle afforded by this elite, is vastly out of reach for those
without similar purchasing power, therefore creating gross differences in
culture.
In the end, our values are based on what works and helps us create easier,
better lives. If we live in a system that rewards competition, unenlightened
self-interest, corruption, vanity and arrogance, then these are the values
that will constantly be perpetuated in society.
While many people give lip
service to 'honesty, caring for others and humility', it is easy to see why
these qualities do not prevail, for the system of survival in society today
does not support or reinforce them.
Mechanism Five -
Fiscal Manipulation
Currency used today is called "fiat", which means its value comes
essentially from government decree. In other words, there is nothing "backing up" the value of the currency other than perhaps the sweat of
laborers who exchange their services for the currency.
Many years ago, most
currencies were on a 'gold standard' which provided a pseudo-empirical basis
for the value of a currency note, but this was still entirely arbitrary, for
the source of value was simply shifted to this raw material called "Gold",
which also has no intrinsic value in and of itself. The 'value' of any
material is relative to its scarcity (supply) and demand, and these
attributes are always in flux and hence unstable.
This so-called "supply and demand" equation also applies directly to
Monetary Value. Value within the fiat system is derived from how much money
is in circulation within an economy. Just as with any natural resource, the
more money that is in circulation, the less each unit of fiat currency is
worth. When less money is in circulation, it makes each unit worth more,
respectively.
This
phenomenon is called "Inflation" and "Deflation'', generally speaking
*.
*
The classic definition of Inflation is 'rising prices' (price inflation),
while Deflation is 'falling prices'. However the primary cause of this 'Price Inflation' and
'Price Deflation' is the increase and decrease in the
supply of money (Monetary Inflation). That being said, this is not the only
possible cause of these conditions. Over/Under Production itself can
influence this as well. There can also be a period of Inflation and
Deflation at the same time, such as when a systemic crisis occurs, which
contracts the money supply faster than money can be created and put into it.
Very
simply, if new money is pumped into an economy, without regard for the
current demand for goods and services, the prices in the economy will
eventually rise as the value of the currency becomes worth proportionally
less. This is an "Inflationary Effect". However, if the new money is quickly
put to use in the creation of new goods and services, while there exists a
demand to purchase those products, it can be introduced into the economy
without a substantial inflationary effect.
For example, if there is a demand
in the market for new homes, and the government injects 1 billion dollars of
new money into the economy,
and all that money is put to use for creating these new homes, which are
then bought, the inflationary effect is minimal.
The increase in the supply of money available in an economy is called
Monetary Expansion, while a decrease in the supply of money is called
Monetary Contraction. When both of these forces are in play, you tend to get
a cyclical trend, called the "Expansion and Contraction Cycle", also known
as the "Business Cycle" or the "Boom and Bust Cycle" (more on this below).
Generally speaking, the Expansion period is usually associated with so
called "Economic Growth", for more money is being put to use and often more
jobs are created. Conversely, the Contraction period is often called a
Recession or Depression, for money is drying up and hence there is less
money to put to use, so jobs are lost and companies fail.
The concept of "Economic growth" is typically defined as:
"the increase in
the amount of the goods and services produced by an economy over time".
The
GDP ('gross domestic product') measurement system, which basically compares
the 'income' and 'output' of an economy in a certain time period, is
commonly used to gauge this so called "Economic Growth".
Now, before we go any further, let it be noted that the whole idea of
Economic Growth, as it is traditionally interpreted, is nonsense with
respect to true human development.
There is no such thing as true economic
growth in and of itself, for the underlying mechanism is based almost
entirely on the amount of liquidity (money) in the system. In other words,
if I counterfeit 100 million US dollars and give it to you to start a
business (you don't know it's counterfeit) and you buy and fix up an old
building, hire a team of employees and start to produce a product that the
public buys, this would be considered an 'expansion' of the economy.
You
have invested in real estate increased the employment rate and created
new products that others buy, therefore exciting the circulation of currency
(the 'consumption cycle'). Now, what if it was found out that all that money
you had was counterfeit, and the whole operation was shut down? This would
be a 'contraction' of the economy, for the money thus vanishes; your
employees would be laid off, the building foreclosed upon, and the
production halted.
Given the above scenario, one should ask: What was the real growth? If the
increase (expansion) in the supply of money can result in the creation of
jobs and production, while the decrease (contraction) results in the loss of
jobs and production, what exactly was the point?
To understand this more clearly, we need to look at how money is created and
regulated by the government and/or its central bank. For this example, we
will use the United States and its central bank- The Federal Reserve.
As noted above, the 'expansion and contraction cycle' is a cyclical pattern,
which has to do with the infusion and relinquishing of money in the system.
This pattern is largely controlled and manipulated by the Central Bank
(Federal Reserve) by way of
Interest Rates.
An Interest Rate is a fee
charged to a borrower for the use of an amount of money. This fee is based
on a percentage of the amount borrowed.
Since all money in the US economy
and nearly every other economy in the world is created out of
debt through loans, the speed by which money comes into existence depends on
how much a person is willing to pay in interest to acquire that loan. The
Commercial Banks base their interest rates on values set by the Central
bank.
For example, in America the "Prime Rate" is the lowest interest rate
charged by banks to their most creditworthy customers. This rate is based on
what is called the "Federal Funds Rate" which is dictated by the Federal
Reserve. Now, it is not the scope of this book to dissect the complex,
jargon filled methods used by the banking system. However, the important
point here is to understand that the Federal Reserve has the power to
influence the interest rates of all banks.
This translates into the power to
control the amount of money being borrowed, and hence the amount in
circulation.
When the Fed lowers its interest rates, so do the commercial banks and
credit (borrowing) becomes less expensive. When the Fed raises its interest
rates, credit becomes more expensive. In a low interest environment more
people are likely to borrow money, put it to use, and create so called
"economic growth" (Expansion).
In a high interest environment, less can
afford to borrow money, less is put to use and economic growth slows or
reverses (Contraction). This is all the so-called "Business Cycle" is, and
the Federal Reserve, through its use of interest rate
manipulation, can "throttle" the expansion and contraction of money at will,
to a certain degree.
Why does the Fed need to control this?
*
*
Chicago Federal Reserve, Modern Money Mechanics, 1963
* In the event of
economic failure, where debt/inflation exceeds manageability, interest rate
manipulation can have little or no effect. More on this in Chapter 2
To understand this, you need remember
that,
-
all money is created out of debt (loans)
-
the increase in the supply of money can
lead to Inflation
If the money supply was allowed to constantly increase (expand), it is
simply a matter of time before the market becomes saturated with excess
liquidity stifling the resulting economic growth.
This will then lead to
Inflation, depreciating the value of the currency, raising prices. Likewise,
outstanding debt is directly proportional to the money supply, so the more
an economy 'expands', the greater the debt that is created. This sets up an
inevitable systematic crisis for the money needed to pay the
interest charged on the loans does not exist in the economy outright.*
*
For those not familiar with this reality, see
Web of Debt by Ellen Brown,
Chapter 2.
Therefore, there is always more outstanding debt than money in existence.
Once the debt grows larger than a person/company can afford, defaults begin
(often in a systematic way), loans slow and/or stop and the money supply
begins to contract. This particular scenario of debt overpowering and
nullifying expansion could be termed "financial failure", very simply.
Now, before we go any further, we need to talk about Debt more specifically.
It needs to be clearly understood that debt itself is also a very active
tool for social control, but not in ways most would consider. In a Monetary
System, the whole structure is based on human participation. The structure
is always hierarchical, so those at the top of the pyramid always benefit
more than the majority at the bottom.
Therefore keeping people motivated to
be employed and fearful of losing their jobs and thus subservient, is a
positive circumstance for those at the top. A person, who "needs" a job, is
more likely to take a lower wage, and less likely to cause problems. One of
the most reliable ways to get people to work and maintain subordination is
to put them into debt. A person in a lot of debt is going to be much more
submissive to the system, than a person who has no debt.
This mechanism of
"Debt Slavery" is little talked about, for most simply do not even think
about it.
Every dollar in existence theoretically has to be paid back to the
banking system and in order to pay that money back, it must be "earned" by
the indebted parties, usually through the form of "wage" or "profit", hence
requiring human service/servitude.
This issue is compounded by the reality that there is always more
outstanding debt than money in existence (due to the interest charged),
making the public's attempt to "break even" within the system futile. There
will always be more debt to pay back, ensuring the slavery of the masses.
Now, in the next chapter, we will continue our analysis of the financial
system and its policies to point out how the repeated failures of the system
are built right into the very structure of it, one way or another.
Before we do, let's summarize what has been discussed in this chapter:
Summary of Chapter 1
Our world is dominated by the practice of Monetary Economics (aka, the
"Monetary System"). Based on this system, the 'value' of a good or service
is generally defined by the availability (degree of scarcity) of the
resources required, along with the amount/type of human labor involved in
the production/service.
Based on this value theory, if goods and services
could be produced with no human labor, coupled with resources that were in
complete abundance, the value (price tag) would be
zero, hence not having a monetary value at all. If such a situation were to
occur, perhaps with the use of automation for labor and chemical processes
to find substitutions for scarce resources, the entire financial/profit
system would have no true basis and could not exist.
A driving undercurrent of the marketplace is scarcity. Industry at large
wants scarcity, for it increases demand. This reality creates an immediate
disregard for the environment/human concern and reinforces abusive methods
that work to limit production capacity and resource availability, rather
than expand it for the greater good. Therefore, abundance is impossible.
Also, the currency in the system is deliberately made scarce by the central
banks, forcing humans to battle each other on a daily basis, with there
never being enough to go around, perpetuating poverty and class
stratification.
The Monetary System requires 'cyclical consumption', or constant turnover
in the marketplace. This translates into a natural propensity/need to create
inferior products that break down quickly, for if very long lasting, durable
and sustainable products were created, the market would suffer, for less
people would have a need to repair or re-purchase a product.
This leads to
high levels of multiplicity, waste and pollution. If products in society
were actually designed to last long periods of time, through the use of the
best known materials and methods, the monetary system could not exist, for
it can only work when constant financial "input" is generated by purchases.
The most important issue for a human being is survival, and in a Monetary
System this inherent self-interest translates into the constant pursuit of
'Profit'. This mentality has proven to cause far more problems than benefits
for society, for social concern is always second to monetary gain. If
industry truly 'cared' about society, putting the welfare and best interests
of people as the first priority, the monetary system would not work, for the
entire orientation of the structure requires "differential advantage". In
other words, 'equality' and 'fairness' have no place in a system where the
entire basis of survival has to do with competition.
Of course, advocates of
the system will tell you that the system creates "incentive", but this
incentive is really the incentive for monetary gain and nothing more.
Meaningful contributions to society in this system are a chance byproduct,
not the initial intent. Financial corruption is also always constant, with
many forms simply accepted as "the way it is" and legal.
Concurrently, War
is the ultimate form of economic stimulus and this makes death and
destruction a positive thing for those who are in commercial/political
positions to benefit from it. War is in fact wanted by industry, regardless
of its inhumanity. Given this reality, war will likely never go away as long
as the profit system is in place, while human behavior itself will always
have an abusive propensity, due to the need to gain advantage over each
other for survival.
The Human Value System is largely a product of the environment. The
influence of the Monetary System, in both the ruthless mentalities it
necessitates for gain, along with the distorted values created by
advertising agencies to condition people into buying something, has created
a culture of vain, selfish, aggressive and insecure people.
Vanity, Ego,
Jealousy and Greed are all byproducts of the system and when it comes to the
'promotion' of sales, the end result is more important than the means.
Likewise, the competitive, self-interest oriented motivation inherent in the
pursuit of profit creates a general disregard for the well being of others,
perpetuating inclinations for abuse and advantage.
Money used in the world today is Fiat and is usually regulated by the
Central Banks. In the United States, the
Federal Reserve (its central bank)
manipulates interest rates in order to control the expansion and contraction
of the money supply.
Debts generated by loans (remember that money comes
into existence from loans; hence money is created out of debt) are
exaggerated by the use of interest, for the money to pay back the interest
charged on the loan is never respectfully created in the money supply.
Therefore, when the money supply is expanded, typically creating "economic
growth" (new money being put to use), a proportionate amount of debt is
created as well, forcing people to submit to employment to afford the debt
obligation.
Since the interest + principle of the outstanding loans will
always exceed the available money supply, this aspect constitutes nothing
less than a form of economic slavery, for it is virtually impossible for the
collective public to ever get out of debt. Also, the term 'Economic Growth'
is actually nonsense, for all expansive growth is temporary and must be
counter balanced by contraction.
The only reason more jobs are created is
because more money is in circulation.
Chapter 2: The Final Failure
Beyond Irresponsibility
David Walker, former US Comptroller General and chief of the GAO, warned
before the 2004 election that if large economic changes were not made, by
2009 the United States and its taxpayers would not be able to afford the
interest payments on the national debt 12.
A study authorized by the US
Treasury in 2001 found that in order to keep servicing the debt at its
current rate of growth, by 2013 income taxes would need to be raised to
65% 13. If the United States cannot afford to pay the interest on its debts,
that would be the final stage of economic collapse and hence result in a
total textbook bankruptcy.
12 Al Martin , Protocols for Economic Collapse in America (article) 2008
13
Ellen Brown, Web of Debt, Third Millennium Press p.368
The systematic crisis would in turn likely spread
to the rest of the world, due to the financial/commercial interconnections
inherent.
How did this happen? Why is the US national debt $12,250,000,000,000 as of
Jan 2009?
Of the 203 countries in the world today, only four (!) do not owe
others money. The collective external debt of all the governments in the
world is now about 52 trillion dollars 14 and this number doesn't include the
massive about of household debt in each country
The whole world is basically bankrupt. But how? How can the world as a whole
owe money to itself?
Obviously, it's all nonsense.
There is no such thing as 'money'. There are
only planetary resources, human labor and human ingenuity. The monetary
system is nothing more than a game
and an outdated and dysfunctional one at
that. Those in positions of social power alter the rules of the game, at
will.
The nature of those rules is guided by the same competitive, distorted
mentalities that are used in everyday "monetary" life, only this time the
game is rigged at its root to favor those who run the show.
For example, if you have 1 million dollars and put it into a CD at 5%
interest, you are going to generate $50,000 a year simply for that deposit.
You are making money off of money itself
paper being made from other paper
nothing more - no invention - no contribution to society no nothing...
That being denoted, if you are a lower to middle class person, who is
limited in funds, and must get interest based loans to buy your home or use
credit cards, then you are paying interest to the bank, which the bank is
then using, in theory, to pay the person's return with the 5% CD!
Not only
is this equation outrageously offensive due to the use of usury (interest)
to 'steal from the poor and give to the rich', but it also perpetuates class
stratification by its very design, keeping the lower classes poor, under the
constant burden of debt, while keeping the upper classes rich, with the
means to turn excess money into more money, with no labor.
That reality aside, there are other games in the system which have worked
for decades, but are just now starting to bloom into the inevitable
mathematic disasters that should have been anticipated 100 years ago.
The 'Boom and Bust Cycle' (aka - "The Business Cycle")
Surface definitions of the "Business Cycle" typically read:
"the recurring fluctuations in economic
activity consisting of recession and recovery and growth and decline" 15
14 CIA World Factbook ,2009,
https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2079rank.html
15
wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn
However, this says nothing about the cause of the
fluctuation. While there are various theories on the cause, it seems most
economists tend to shy away from the 'elephant in the living room'
and that
is the powerful effect Monetary Contraction (money removed) and Expansion (new money added) have on
the Business Cycle.
When money is added to the money supply, that money is then typically put to
use for some reason.
Very often these reasons include starting a business,
buying a home, investing in the stock market, etc. This application of money
often translates into so called "economic growth". Credit Expansion, in the
form of personal and business loans, is really the hidden force behind
economic growth. This is basically the 'Boom' period of the Boom and Bust
cycle. If you examine prior trends of economic expansion in the United
States, you will find a lockstep correlation to the expansion of credit. (i.e.
1990-2000 stock market bubble)
Unfortunately, money cannot be added into the economy infinitely, for the
Debt and Inflation caused by the expansion will eventually overcome the
"growth" benefits. This is due to the reality that new money is always
needed to cover the outstanding debt, largely due to the need to pay back
the interest on the loans (which does not respectfully exist in the money
supply).
What this means is that after a period of growth (boom) with the
economic indicators now pointing towards a weakening economy, a choice can
be made by the financial regulators/government to either:
-
Continue the expansion by infusing even more money, often by lowering
the interest rates (such as the 'prime' or 'discount' rate) or by simply
moving large sums of money to certain sectors (such as the 2008 700 Billion
dollar bank bailout)
-
Let the contraction (recession) run its course,
raise the interest rates, and bring the economy
back to some kind of equilibrium, thus preparing it for another expansion.*
As far as history is concerned, the pattern has been to do both, basically
with the idea being to "ease" the recession by increasing liquidity.
The
reasoning is simple. It is politically unpopular for the ruling class to
have unemployed, poor citizens. This can lead to contempt for the leadership
and perhaps revolution. Therefore, there is always the game of placating the
public with false security in order to avoid the truth coming out about the
inherent dysfunctionality and corruption of the
Ponzi scheme known as the
Monetary System.**
*
These are generalized, summary examples. It is not in the interest of this
booklet to detail all components and attributes.
** In a system where money
is created on top of money out of debt, with interest charged, creating more
debt owed back than is even in circulation- this system is a textbook
pyramid scheme. The tool is called the "Fractional Reserve System". Read Web
of Debt, chapter 2, by Ellen Brown, for more about this monetary expansion
policy.
Now, the result of this "easing" of the contraction simply delays the
inevitable and since the US Government has "eased" virtually every
contraction we have seen in the last 70 years by infusing
more money into the system, a "Doomsday scenario" awaits
the "big
contraction"
and it might be happening at the time of this writing.
Figure 1 below is the idealized business cycle, moving about a constant
mean, with peaks as the "boom" and troughs as the "bust":
Figure 1
But considering that money has always been strategically injected into the
system when contraction occurs, the 'mean' path is actually ascending.
Figure 2 below is an idealized depiction of what has actually been happening
for the past 70 years and what could be in store as the "big contraction"
looms.
Figure 2
As of March 2006, the US Government stopped reporting
M3, which is the total
amount of money in the economy in virtually all forms. What is the reason
for this? - they don't want the public to realize how much money is being
pumped into the system.
Figure 3 below shows M3 up until they stopped
reporting it.
Figure 3
Regardless of the discontinued reporting by the Fed, secular economists have
been able to track the components of the M3 independently* and what has been
noticed is that since 2006, M3 has grown from about 10 trillion to 14.5
trillion by the end of 2008, a near 50% increase in less than 3 years.
(Figure 4).

Figure 4
How far can we go? At this rate, by 2015, the money supply will be about
30
trillion dollars.
Now, just because money is being pumped into the system does not always mean
economic expansion is occurring. This is a critical point. For instance, one
of the hallmark indicators of economic expansion is the creation of jobs.
Figure 5 below shows the US unemployment levels,
including the SGS component which takes into account those non-working
Americans who are not currently counted as "unemployed" simply because the
period of acknowledgment has ended.
Figure 5
While official government agencies reported that unemployment was around 7%
at the end of 2008, deeper research reveals it is actually closer to 18% of
the US population. More on the reasons for this reality will be addressed in
the next section.
(The Ultimate Outsource), but for now let's simply use
this information to understand that the current infusion of money into the
money supply is not having an effect in the current financial crisis. As
noted earlier, money cannot be added into the economy infinitely, for the
Debt and Inflation caused by the expansion will eventually overcome the
"growth" benefits.
This is what is now happening and no intervention
(bailout) to "ease" this crisis is likely to work.
The SGS Alternate Unemployment Rate reflects current unemployment
reporting methodology adjusted for SGS-estimated "discouraged workers"
defined away during the Clinton Administration added to the existing BLS
estimates of level U-6 unemployment.
http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data
Why?
Mainly because the debt levels are too high.
Total debt of the US
government plus its citizens was about 53,000,000,000,000 16 in 2007(Figure
6).
Figure 6
This is insane when you realize that in 2007 the total
US money supply
(M3) was only about 12,000,000,000,000.
Are we going to now inject over 40
trillion dollars into the US economy to cover this? No, because not only
would this create trillions in new debt, it would likely cause
hyperinflation on a grand scale.
From a different angle, the GDP of the US
in 2007 was only about 14 trillion! 17
Right now (2009) it is deflation and inflation, occurring at the same time,
with deflation, in the form of contraction, winning. Money is vanishing
faster than it can be put in, to put it loosely. While the system itself
sets up this inevitability on its own, the chain of events for the current
collapse seemed to start with the rampant speculative bubble in the housing
market.
Once that crashed, the
Derivatives market, (which is holding values
that exceed the GDP of the entire planet many times over 18) which gambled on
those home mortgages, became "toxic" due to the foreclosures.

require credit; inevitably arriving at the laying off of the work force
itself. This
systemic crisis is global, due to the international nature of
the Financial Markets, which is why the countries in the western world are
now seeing similar economic problems as America.
However, please note that even though it seems as though the housing bubble
and "predatory loans" are "to blame" for this crisis, they really aren't.
This failure would have occurred one way or another due to the very nature
of the economic system.
However, the incredible irresponsibility involved in
managing this already detrimental system has greatly exaggerated and
accelerated the severity of pending collapse, making the future look very
grim if this false structure, known as the "Monetary System", is to be
maintained.
The Ultimate Outsource
Everything described in the preceding section is of great importance in
terms of understanding where we are and where we are going within this
economic structure. Please note this information is just as relevant to
non-Americans as it is to Americans, for the world shares the same basic
system and is tightly interlinked.
Now, in response to these problems, very often people suggest 'monetary
reform' as the solution. These suggestions often consist of: going back to
the gold standard; outlawing interest; shutting down the Federal Reserve and
giving the power of printing money to the government and letting the
government distribute it debt free
etc.
While these reforms and others all pose logical merits, they do not
recognize an unstoppable phenomenon that has accelerated since the early
20th century, which has greatly impacted the labor force since:
The replacement of human labor with machines
At the core of the economic system itself is the mechanism of Labor for
Income.
Our entire economic system is based on human beings selling their
labor as a commodity in the open market. If humans do not have the option to
"work for a living", then the monetary system as we know it is over. No one
can buy goods if they don't earn money. Companies cannot afford to produce
if the consumer has no purchasing power. This issue overrides everything
that has previously been discussed in this chapter.
As John Maynard Keynes, in
The General Theory of Unemployment, Interest and
Money disdainfully points out:
"We are being afflicted with a new disease of
which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which
they will hear a great deal in the years to come namely 'technological
unemployment'. This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of
economizing the use of labor outrunning the pace at which we can find
new uses for labor." 19
While politicians, business leaders and labor leaders bicker over issues
they claim are responsible for the growing unemployment in the world, such
as foreign company outsourcing or immigrant labor, the real cause is going
unaddressed in the public debate:
Technological Unemployment
In the words of Nobel Laureate Economist Wassily Leontief:
"The role of humans as the most important
factor of production is bound to diminish in the same way that the role
of horses in agricultural production was first diminished and then
eliminated by the introduction of tractors." 20
Since Market Capitalism is built upon the logic of reducing input costs
(including the costs of labor) to increase profits, the inclination to
replace human labor whenever possible by machine automation is a natural
progression of industry. After all, a machine doesn't need to take breaks,
it doesn't require health insurance or benefits, and it isn't a part of a
demanding Labor Union.
A simple glance at US historical labor statistics by sector shows the
pattern of machine automation replacing human labor definitively. In the
Agricultural sector, almost all traditional workflow is now done by machine.
-
In 1949, machines did 6% of the cotton picking in the South.
-
By 1972, 100%
of the cotton picking was done by machines.21
-
When automation hit the US
Manufacturing Sector in the 1950s, 1.6 million blue-collar jobs were lost in
9 years 22.
-
In 1860, 60% of America worked in Agriculture, while today it is
less than 3%.23
-
In 1950, 33% of US workers worked in Manufacturing, while by
2002 there was only 10%.24
-
The US steel industry, from 1982 to 2002
increased production from 75m tons to 120m tons, while steel workers went
from 289,000 to 74,000.25
-
In 2003, Alliance Capital did a study of the
world's largest 20 economies at that time, ranging from the period of 1995
to 2002, finding that 31 million manufacturing jobs were lost, while
production rose by 30% 26
This pattern of Increasing Productivity and
Profit, coupled with Decreasing Employment, is a new and powerful
phenomenon, with no changes in sight.

So
where have those jobs gone?
The Service Sector
While from 1950 to
2002, the percentage of
Americans employed in the service industries went from 59% to 82% 27. For the
last 50 years, the service sector has been absorbing the job losses from
Agriculture and Manufacturing.
Unfortunately, this pattern is slowing fast as computerized automation takes
hold. From 1983-1993, banks cut 37% of their human tellers, and by the year
2000, 90% of all bank customers used teller machines (ATMs) 28. Business
phone operators have almost all been replaced by computerized voice
answering systems, post office tellers are being replaced by self-service
machines, while cashiers are being replaced by computerized kiosks.
McDonalds, for example, has been talking about full automation of its
restaurants for many years now, introducing Kiosks to replace the front of
house staff, while using automated cooking tools, such as burger flippers,
for the back of house staff 29.
The fact that they haven't done so is likely
a public relations issue, for they know how many jobs would be cut in the
event they did automate.
There isn't one area of the Service Industry that
isn't being affected by computerized automation. In fact, if one was to
think creatively about the application of technology that currently exists,
but is not yet applied to the service sector, it is easy to see how, almost
overnight, the majority of all service jobs could be phased out today,
starting with tellers, cashiers, waiters, and phone operators.
Economist Stephen Roach has warned:
"The service sector has lost its role as
America's unbridled engine of job creation." 30

Interview, 3/15/94 noted in
The End of Work (by Jeremy Rifkin), p. 143
As this transition occurs, where is the emerging new sector to employ all
the newly displaced workers?
There really isn't one
at least not yet. While
there are many specialized fields emerging in the Information realm, they
are extremely limited in their ability to offer anything close to
compensation for the vast job loss on the horizon.
And while economists
struggle to create models to deal with this issue of nearly unstoppable
unemployment, ranging from the government subsidization of labor (welfare)
to novel notions such as a 'negative income tax', most refuse to consider
what is really needed in order to prevent total chaos on this planet.
The
solution lies not in attempting to 'fix' the issues that have emerged, but
rather it is time we transcend the system in its entirety
for the system of
monetary exchange, along with Capitalism itself, is now completely obsolete
in the wake of technological creativity.
Summary of Chapter 2
The Monetary System of the world is nothing more than a game. It has little
basis in reality. It emerged thousands of years ago when scarcity of
resources was an everyday problem. People back
then needed some way to distribute goods and services, while compensating
those who worked to create them. This Monetary based Labor System has been a
staple of society for so long, that most people can't even imagine a world
without it.
Regardless, the mechanisms of the system, both structurally and
psychologically, have created dramatic problems for the whole of society,
ranging from monetary crime and emotional distortion, to the abuse and
exploitation of the planet and each other on vast scales.
The world today is
really just a series of tribalistic Mafias.
The line between organized crime
and traditional business is really nonexistent. In turn, the whole world
stands at odds with itself, with individuals, businesses and countries
perpetually working to defend what they have, while always working to gain
more, often by force and corruption. In turn, now the whole world is in debt
to itself, owing comical amounts of money, while the very integrity of the
world financial structure is on the verge of collapse due to its own
shortcomings.
However, even with these points denoted, there stands an even
more powerful, unforeseen force which guarantees the demise of the Economic
system as we know it for good, and it comes in the form of Technological
Unemployment.
Human beings are being replaced by advanced automation
technologies at an accelerating rate, setting up a disaster of unprecedented
proportions, for if people do not have jobs, they cannot support the economy
by purchasing anything.
This reality is the final proof that our current
system is now out of date, and if we want to deter riots in the streets and
poverty on a scale never before seen, we are going to have to revise our
traditionalized notions about how society functions at the fundamental
level.
We require a new social system that is updated to present-day knowledge and
modern methods.
Part 2
What is Relevant?
Chapter 3: Natural Law
When we step out of the societal complex and examine ourselves and the world
from a broader perspective, we tend to find that there is a tremendous
amount of noise in the system. In other words, the fundamentals of life have
been lost in a sea of social, occupational and financial obligations, many
of which are largely artificial. For example, the need for money and income
puts the human into a position where choice is often very limited.
Usually,
the work found for income does not reflect the genuine interests of that
particular person, nor the interests of society as a whole. If we were to
examine the occupations that exist today, we would tend to find that a great
majority of them serve no larger function than the perpetuation of 'cyclical
consumption'. This arbitrariness constitutes a tremendous waste of life and
resources.
For instance, a person who sells insurance is participating in an
occupation that is only relevant to the inner workings of the monetary
system, and has no basis in nature in regard to a real 'contribution to
society'. The same goes for stock brokers, traders and anything else that
deals with the financial sector. These are arbitrary, vain roles that
contribute nothing real to society in the long term.
While it will be argued
that the role they serve affects people on a day to day basis within the
economic system, it is time we really step back and begin to focus our
efforts on social issues that are actually relevant to social progress
as
opposed to arbitrary jobs conjured up to extract wealth from each other.
This is a waste of life.
Consequently, the entire educational system in the
modern day is nothing more than a cookie cutter processing plant that
prepares humans for mostly predefined occupational roles. This element of
human life has become so traditionally ingrained, that many falsely consider
the nature of 'having a job' some form of human instinct.
Even parents will
ask their kids "What do you want to be when you grow up?" as though there
was only one thing.
This is disturbing and a violation of human potential.
Now, for the sake of argument, let's forget about the current modes of
conduct in society and consider what is actually real.
Let's pose the
question:
What are the near-empirical facets of nature and what do these
understandings teach us about how we should govern our conduct on this
planet?
Natural Law 1
Every human needs adequate nutrition, clean air and clean
water and therefore must respect the symbiotic environmental processes
inherent.
Firstly, about 40 percent of the deaths worldwide are now caused by water,
air and soil pollution.31 This is a staggering percentage. How can society
take itself seriously when we can't even keep our most vital life supporting
natural resources and processes in good form?!
31
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-08/cuns-pc4081307.php
Why are many so-called
scientists today working on esoteric interests like 'black holes', 'quantum
fields' and 'terra-forming' other planets, when we can't even take care of
ourselves yet!
The fact is, most humans do not understand or consider the interconnectivity
of nature and the chain of processes by which our food, air and water
currently come about. However, if we examine and learn from these processes,
a logical train of reasoning, coupled with suggestive inference, will guide
us to more appropriate human behaviors that will help fulfill our needs.
For example, water and air are naturally abundant planetary resources that
only require that we, the
human population, maintain them and preserve their sources. Sadly, our
impulsive, narrow sighted profit system has seen to it that usable water is
now approaching crisis scarcity, for Industry continues to pollute the
system at every turn.
Air, on the other hand, while still very abundant
overall, has been heavily polluted in areas of high human concentration, to
the effect where in Asia many wear facemasks when they walk around. Of
course, polluted air and water lead to countless other problems. In the
United States alone about 3 million tons of toxic chemicals are released
into the environment a year - contributing to birth defects, immune system
disorders, cancer and many other serious health problems.32
In turn, even
the source processes of our air and water are being compromised. From acid
rain to deforestation, we are seeing a continual breakdown of what used to
be a natural, clean abundance.
In regard to food production, we must first note that Industry today goes
out of its way to produce the cheapest, most competitive food, while
consequently sacrificing nutritional health. For example, a great majority
of foods today have what is called "high fructose corn syrup".
This cheap
replacement for cane sugar has been proven to increase the risk of Diabetes
and other health problems substantially.33

33
http://www.diabeteshealth.com/read/2008/08/20/4274/the-dangers-of-high-fructose-corn-syrup/
Why do we have it!?
because it is
profitable and the public, always being cost conscious, buys it because it
is more affordable.
The symbiotic relationship of natural processes has a built in frame of
reference, which is assessable by understanding how the world actually
works, via scientific investigation. Our behavior should be guided by the
priority of seeking the highest optimization of circumstances that preserve
and maximize the abundance and quality of our necessities of life. Sadly,
this is not happening.
The fact is, our sustainability is under severe threat by the current
methods we are using. The monetary system continues to operate with the
interest of short-term gain, ignoring the long-term destruction. As Natural
Law denotes, we need high quality air, food and water to live, therefore, we
must overcome any systems which disturb, or create the propensity to
disturb, the symbiotic environmental processes which keep our basic needs in
order.
If we don't, the consequences of our violation of this law could put
us past the point of no return environmentally - and thus the survival of
the human race will be in question.
Natural Law 2
The only constant is change and human understandings are
always in transition.
There is no evidence to support the idea that anything we think is true
today will maintain its integrity tomorrow. And yes, paradoxically, this
goes for everything you are reading here. While
certain observed natural phenomena may seem near empirical based on current
scientific evidence, the specifics of each notion will always be altered,
for our tools and methods of analysis and measurement are always changing
and hopefully, improving.
In the words of C.J. Keyser:
"Absolute certainty is a privilege of
uneducated minds and fanatics" 34
34 Fresco and Keyes, Looking Forward, Barnes, 1969, p. 62
A cursory glance at widely defended historical notions, from the earth being
flat to the sun revolving around the earth, teaches us that intellectual
change is constant and, in turn, humans must keep as 'open' a mind as
possible to new information, even if it challenges that person's sense of
identity. It is an unfortunate evolutionary side effect that in modern
culture, a great deal of ego is involved with beliefs and values.
Religion,
for example, tends to hold tight to static worldviews that often reflect an
understanding of reality that stretches back thousands of years prior. Due
to the very construct of many religious ideas, which tend to threaten
metaphysical consequences (heaven/hell) for those who contradict its
teachings, many people in the world today maintain these worldviews out of
fear, rejecting new information that could help them in their lives, not to
mention society itself.
Of course, religion is far from alone in this, for
it seems most humans tend to want to believe that what they find right and
true is empirically correct. This, of course, makes sense, for society today
often belittles those who "don't know."
Everything we think and "know" are only probabilities and with modern
methods of analysis, which have proven to have proactive benefits to society
over long periods of time, we can now weigh our understandings and beliefs
on a sliding scale, ranging from least probable to most probable, based not
on human opinion or subjectivity, but on concrete feedback responses from
the natural world.
The Scientific Method
Nature itself has its own set of laws, and it doesn't have the capacity to
recognize or care about what you or anyone else wants to believe is true.
Given this reality, it is in our best interest to learn and align with
nature as best we can. Walking with the current of the ocean is much easier
than fighting against it
and while one could believe with all their heart
that they can walk on a ceiling with no physical aides, the Law of Gravity
will not allow it.
The best-known method for the discovery and application of the laws of
nature is termed: "The Scientific Method".
The Scientific Method basically has three steps:
-
Recognizing a new idea or problem that needs to be solved
-
The use of
logical reasoning* to create a hypothesis, considering all information
available
-
Test the hypothesis in the physical
world through observation
*
'Logic' is hereby defined as: a method of human thought that involves
thinking in a linear, step-by-step, cause and effect oriented manner, taking
into account as much relevant information as possible, in order to reach a
conclusion or hypothesis.
The Scientific Method refers to a body of techniques used for investigating
phenomena; acquiring new knowledge; correcting and integrating previous
knowledge and the application of such knowledge.
The techniques used consist
of empirical observation methods, (such as measurement), along with reasoned
hypotheses and, ultimately, putting those hypotheses to test in the real
world to obtain feedback regarding an idea's validity. All conclusions
require testable proof, not just inference or reason. While logical
reasoning is important to the unfolding of scientific inquiry, it is still
subject to failure, for each one of us is always in a state of limited
knowledge.
A classical example of this goes back to Aristotle (384 BC 322 BC). He
hypothesized, through logical reasoning based on what he understood at that
time, that a heavy object would fall faster than a lighter object of the
same shape and material.
He logically assumed that the more weight an object
had, the faster an object would fall in a vacuum. However, he didn't test
the idea. Because of this failure to properly use the scientific method, the
world had to wait 2000 more years, for when Galileo finally tested
Aristotle's hypothesis
he found Aristotle to be wrong - weight does not
determine the rate at which an object falls in a vacuum.
The point here is that it doesn't matter how correctly reasoned our
conclusions might be, they have to be tested. If we throw water onto a wood
burning fire, the fire will likely go out. This gives us a certain degree of
information that we gain inference from:
"Water puts out fire".
While this
theory might hold true for most fire scenarios, if you throw water onto an
Oil Fire, the oil will quickly float to the top of the water and the fire
will spread. Therefore the hypothesis that "Water puts out fire" is not
exactly true, and would need to be revised to take this new scenario into
account.
The Scientific Method is also an attitude; a perspective. No matter how
'right' something may seem, we are going to check it out by observational
testing and actually see if it holds validity. In fact, we should to be very
skeptical of any claim that cannot be seen or tested in the physical world.
In the words of Stuart Chase:
"[The scientific method] is concerned with how
things do happen, not how they ought to happen. Most of us are amateur
scientists today, though we are seldom aware of it
The scientific method is
not primarily a matter of
laboratories and atom-smashers or even meter sticks; it is a way of looking
at things, a way of gathering from the world outside knowledge which will
stay put, and not go wandering off like the wickets in Alice's croquet
game." 35
35 Chase, Stuart, Tyranny of Words, Harcourt Brace, NY, 1938, pp.-123-24
The scientific method of inquiry is what has allowed the human species to
gain comprehension of themselves and the physical world. For better or for
worse, it is what's behind virtually every advancement that has improved the
lives of the human species.
While some might debate what constitutes
"improvement", there is nothing else in life that holds a candle to the vast
amount of creation and freedom that science has made possible. All of the
physical and material benefits humankind enjoys is a product of scientific
inquiry. From the electric light, to the cotton gin, to Penicillin, to the
telephone, to the Internet
science has continually made what was previously
considered impossible
possible.
Even the most arcane, traditionally oriented
religious believer will usually give in to the world of science and go to a
hospital for medical care in an emergency.
However, most in our romanticized world still tend to view science as a
cold, heartless medium, while citing distorted human value abominations such
as the
Atomic Bomb in refutation of the scientific perspective. In reality,
science and technology are only tools, and like anything, they can be used
for productive or destructive purposes.
That is our choice.
Dynamic Equilibrium
"Dynamic Equilibrium" occurs when two or more opposing processes proceed at
the same rate.
Let's say, for a simplified example, that you have a small
island with a:
-
wildly growing annual carrot crop
-
a family of rabbits
-
a family of wolves
The rabbits need the carrots to eat and thus
survive, while the wolves need the rabbits to eat and thus survive. In each
pair, there is an equilibrium that must exist based on the carrying capacity
of the island. If there are not enough carrots to feed the current
population of rabbits, some rabbits will not survive. If there are not
enough rabbits to feed the wolves, some wolves will not survive. If the
carrot crop is destroyed by drought, then no one survives.
In other words, there is an equilibrium that exists in the physical world,
which dictates, on some level, what the possibilities are for those
organisms that utilize the available resources for survival. With respect to
our planet, we would call this the "carrying capacity of the earth".
Due to the monetary system, most materials on the planet are owned by a
number of private corporations. These corporations do not honestly reveal
their stock, for to do so would have ramifications, financially. Even worse,
it is in the best interest of these corporations to perpetuate scarcity as
best they can, for scarcity means more value for each unit, and hence, more
profit.
The human management of the Dynamic Equilibrium on this planet, which is the
most important initial variable regarding the management of society itself,
can only come from first understanding what the carrying capacity of the
earth actually is. The needs of the human population must be in balance with
the resources of the earth.
That being said, what do we know and what can we infer about the planetary
sources available?
The fundamental building blocks of human survival in society consist of the
following:
-
Energy
Energy is the cornerstone of society today. It is one of the most
critical factors to all social functionality. The availability of renewable
energy resources must first be accessed before anything else. Luckily, the
results are staggeringly positive.
By the early 21st century, a sea of
renewable energy sources have been coming to the surface, many with extreme
potential, far exceeding the requirements of the current human population.
The age of Oil and fossil fuels, along with all the resulting pollution, is
coming to a close. There is no reason to burn fossil fuels at all anymore,
other than the profit oriented, vested interest which keeps new energy
prospects at bay. Remember, the last thing the Energy Industry wants is
abundance, for that translates into a loss of profits in the monetary
system.
Now, one of the most important energy sources to recognize today is
Geothermal Power.
A 2006 MIT report on geothermal energy found that 13,000 zettajoules of
power are currently available in the earth, with the possibility of 2000
zettajoules being easily tap-able with improved technology.36
The total
energy consumption of all the countries on the planet is about half of a zettajoule a year37, this means about 4000 years of planetary power could be
harnessed in this medium alone. And when we understand that the earth's heat
generation is constantly renewed, this energy is really limitless and could
be used forever.
Geothermal aside, Solar, Wind, Wave and Tidal energy sources also offer
powerful possibilities if harnessed efficiently with technology. The solar
radiation striking the Earth's surface each year is more than 10,000 times
the world's energy use 38.

37 Based on 2005 figures, World
Consumption of Primary Energy by Energy Type and Selected Country Groups,
1980-2004
38
http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/solar+energy
The problem then is not availability
- it is the technology to harness it most efficiently.
From simple photovoltaic panels that can
capture energy
into storage batteries for private use, to full scale solar power plants,
new technology is constantly emerging which is improving this potential.39
Wind power, while often denounced as weak and impractical, is a lot more
powerful than most people think.
U.S. Department of Energy studies have
concluded wind harvested in the Great Plains states of Texas, Kansas, and
North Dakota could provide enough electricity to power the entire nation.40
More impressively, a 2005 Stanford University study published in the Journal
of Geophysical Research found that if only 20% of the wind potential on the
planet was harnessed, it would cover the entire world's energy needs.41
And then there is Tidal and Wave Power. Tidal Power is derived from tidal
shifts in the ocean. Installing turbines, which capture this movement,
generates energy. Tapping the flow of the Gulf Stream, Icelandic current and
other underwater currents can be harnessed. In the United Kingdom, 42 sites
are currently noted as available, forecasting that 34% of all the UK's
energy could come from Tidal Power alone.42
More effectively, Wave Power,
which extracts energy from the surface motions of the ocean, is estimated to
have a global potential of up to 80,000 TWH a year.43 This means 50% of the
entire planet's energy usage could be produced from this single medium. 44

It is important to point out that tidal, wave, solar and wind power require
virtually no preliminary energy to harness, unlike coal, oil coal, gas,
biomass, hydrogen and all the others.
The fact is, energy is nothing but abundant on this planet.
The only reason people today think it is scarce, is because of the
monetary/capitalist system and its strategic propensity to create scarcity.
-
Industrial/Technological Raw Materials
The next question is what about industrial raw materials? Can the
earth's supply of raw physical resources, such as wood, iron ore, aluminum
and cotton support the world's population?
Everything you see around you is made of tiny particles called atoms. There
are many different types of atoms, each with a special combination of
protons, neutrons and electrons. These different types of
atoms are called elements. There are currently 118 elements of the periodic
table *, with 92 naturally available in our world (the other 26 are
synthetically made) and these elements basically comprise everything around
us.
*
The periodic table is an arrangement of the chemical elements according to
atomic number as based on the periodic law.
The Metals category of elements are the most important, for they only
melt at relatively high temperatures; their shape can be easily changed into
thin wires or sheets without breaking, and heat and electricity travel
easily through them. This makes them very useful for product
creation/industrial application.
These metals can be found in the earth's
crust and in the oceans, either in their pure form, or more commonly,
extracted from minerals. Global Mineral Reserves are currently measured by
commercial output production. Sadly, this does not give a clear picture of
what is available.
While some elements/minerals are vast in abundance, such
as Silicon, Aluminum and Iron, others are seemingly growing scarce, such as
copper, lead, zinc, gold, and silver.45
45
http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/383726/mineral-deposit/82165/Geochemically-abundant-and-scarce-metals
As far as this author knows, there
has never been a complete geological survey of the earth's
minerals/elements, only regional ones. This must be done in the future.
Now, all in all, there are basically 3 components to understanding the
carrying capacity of the earth.
-
Knowing exactly what the earth has as far as component elements/materials
We must have a full survey of all the planetary resources.
This will give us
key information on how to proceed with our operations. For example, if we
have an acre of land that we want to grow food with, the first thing would
be to test the soil to understand what type of properties it has. This
information would have a direct relationship to what can be grown. This
would be the "carrying capacity" of that land, so to speak.
From a planetary
perspective, this is critical information that has a direct effect on our
decision-making.
-
Where technology is in regard to creating synthetic substitutions for
certain elements/materials
The difference between today and the past is our increased creative
ability, through the scientific method, to solve problems. In regard to
scarce materials, finding substitutions is an important field.
For example,
diamonds have long been considered a highly valued, scarce resource. One
application of this strong mineral is as a precision machine-cutting tool.
However, now, with the advent of synthetic diamonds grown in a lab, these
tools do not require the expensive original. Many industrial materials today
now have synthetic counterparts and this medium of scientific problem
solving is very active.
In fact, the scarcity of any raw material is only as
relevant as the amount of work being invested into finding a substitute or
workaround.
-
How society organizes/manages its use of these elements/materials
More important than substitutes and workarounds is the very nature of our
usage of the planetary resources. This is really the most important point in
the debate regarding the carrying capacity of the earth.
As noted before,
the world's people function within a monetary system that rewards scarcity,
planned obsolescence, waste, pollution and multiplicity. Production output
in the world today is staggering compared to the past. With the use of
technology, we are able to produce more with far less people, faster than in
any other time in history.
However, due to the profit system, there are tons
of manufacturers producing the same things, as they compete for market
share. Their items are inherently inferior from the moment they are made,
for the producer has limited the quality of the materials they use to cut
down on their costs. Since it is a competitive system, the waste is
staggering, with precious raw materials being used over and over again in
inferior products that end up in landfills.
Also, the manipulation of the
public by industry into wanting non-utility, vanity based items, has
compounded the waste. Remember, the monetary system can only work if there
is 'cyclical consumption'. This leads to resource abuse. The true cause of
scarcity on the planet has less to do with the available resources, and more
to do with our wasteful and exploitative modes of conduct.
Virtually no
regard is given to conservation or strategic use until it is too late. In a
sane society, the raw materials of the planet would be accessed, industry
would be organized as a whole to produce in relationship to what was
available, and each item produced would be designed to last as long as
possible, causing reduced industrial output and hence resource preservation.
-
Food, Air and Water
Now, when it comes to food production and water preservation, the same
monetary system problems of pollution, cost cutting processes and
scarcity
come into play. (Minimizing waste lowers profits. If one has to reprocess
waste rather than dump it, this is more costly.)
Water covers 70% of the
earth's surface. Technological advancements such as Desalination processes
can make fresh water both from seawater and from challenging brackish
sources using reverse osmosis. This is yet another example of how technology
is just as much a part of resource management as resources themselves. The
idea that usable water is scarce is true only in relationship to the limited
methods we are currently using, coupled with industrial pollution that goes
on daily.
Food production is also expanding within the technological spectrum,
creating vast new methods of cultivation. For instance, the earth's surface
is indeed being abused, with its precious topsoil*
being
corrupted by indifferent agricultural methods.
*
Topsoil is the upper, outermost layer of soil, usually the top 2 to 8
inches. It has the highest concentration of organic matter and
microorganisms and is where most of the Earth's biological soil activity
occurs. Plants generally concentrate their roots in and obtain most of their
nutrients from this layer.
According to some reports, we
are losing topsoil at a rate of 1% a year while the National Academy of
Sciences has determined that cropland in the U.S. is being eroded at least
10 times faster than the time it takes for lost soil to be replaced.46
Fortunately, scientists have devised a new form of soil less agriculture,
called "Hydroponics".
46
http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/348200_dirt22.html
This powerful new medium leaves a sea of options for
the human population, not only in compensating for the damage we have
caused, but also by expanding the possibility of when and where food can be
grown. With hydroponic agriculture, we could theoretically grow food in the
middle of the desert with proper irrigation or by tapping down to the water
table.
Other untapped food production possibilities include suspended multi
deck underwater ocean farms as well as air plants. The bottom line is that
food production is only as scarce as we decide it is. If we choose to become
intelligent and strategic with our production methods, while preserving the
environment and taking full advantage of scientific inventions that maximize
our food production capacities, reducing wasteful and inefficient methods,
healthy food can be as abundant as water itself.
The starving children of
the world are not so because of a lack of available food.
It is their lack
of purchasing power, not true scarcity, which causes the needless deaths of
millions a year.
Summary of Chapter 3
The dynamic equilibrium of planet earth in relationship to the human species
is not a rigid system. It is up to us to keep things in balance through the
intelligent management of the earth's resources. If this is done correctly,
there is no evidence to support that we cannot have abundance for all.
The
three attributes of management are:
-
Knowing the raw materials available
-
Proactively working to overcome any deficiency through strategic
substitutions
-
Using technology in all facets in order to maximize high
quality production, minimize environmental impact and overcome problems in
general
Nature has its own laws and it is in our best interest to
acknowledge them and align our behavior accordingly.
We must be prepared to
find out that what we think to be true today will be updated tomorrow. This
is the emergent nature of knowledge. We learn from our mistakes.
All errors
are really gifts, for they can bring us to a higher level of understanding.
The Scientific Method, with its basis of logical thought, evidence and
testable proof, is the guiding philosophy that has solved problems and
improved humanity's quality of life.
Chapter 4: The Means For Social Evolution
What do we want? How are we going to get there? What tools are required?
Our Values consist of what we find important:
-
our goals
-
what we care about
-
what we hold sacred
-
what we want out of life
Values are not immutable
and eternal, yet values pushed upon a person at a young age often have a
strong power to perpetuate. Traditional indoctrination, such as
nationalistic or religious beliefs, can become pillars of a person's
identity and are difficult to overcome emotionally.
The fact is, human
values come from the environment. If you were to take a child at birth from
a white middle class American family and place him/her in the Middle East
with an Arab, Islamic family, that child would most probably grow up
speaking Arabic and become a Muslim, holding those traditional values that
would have been taught by the family and social culture.
Most of our traditional values were actually set in motion a long time ago.
For instance, the Bible says "You shall earn your living by the sweat of
your brow".
What if society didn't need you to work for money? How could
that value hold true?
The fact is, values become outdated, just like
knowledge and everything else. With respect to the current findings of
science, most of the values of society seem to be out of date by thousands
of years.
That being said, let's now stop for a moment and decide what our valued
goals are, both personally and socially. The Zeitgeist Movement, along with
The Venus Project, has a set of social values and hence goals, which we feel
are critical to the sustainability of the species.
Goals
-
Clean air and water
-
nutritious food
-
material abundance
-
fast,
clean, and efficient transportation
-
relevant education
-
public health care
-
the end of war
-
personal liberty
-
an environment that enables us to
constantly improve our abilities
-
human extensionality
-
reduced stress
-
reduced crime
These social goals are far from complex or irrational. In fact, many will
find that both religious and secular philosophers have been poetically
attempting to address these hopes for millennia.
Method
Now, with our basic goals denoted, we must then think about the methods to
be used in order to accomplish those goals. Unequivocally, The Scientific
Method is the most powerful tool we know.
Observation, Logic and Testing,
have long since trumped superstition, intuition and metaphysics.
In the
words of Karl Pearson:
"There is no shortcut to truth, no way to
gain knowledge of the universe except through the gateway of the
scientific method." 47
47 Pearson, Karl, The Grammar of Science, 1911 p.17
The intelligent use
of the methods of science is what has brought us everything that helps us in
our
daily lives. The application of science to social organization as a whole is
the next step in our evolution. (Please see chapter 3 for more elaboration
on scientific methodology)
Tools
The material tools that we need to accomplish our goals come from the humane
use of Technology. From a simple hammer, to a high tech, fully automated
production plant, technological invention continues to ease production
methods, while also consistently making what was once deemed impossible,
possible.
The history of technology is showing tremendous, accelerating development.
Coupled with the scientific method of thought, the technological tools
currently at our disposal have the ability to dramatically change humanity
in ways most would find too fantastic to be true. If you explained a cell
phone to a man from the 12th century, he would probably be shocked beyond
comprehension at the "magical" instrument.
One characteristic of technology is its ability to constantly defy what is
considered possible. In the words of Dr. George Gallup:
"At every point in
history, man has assumed that civilization has reached its zenith. He has
smugly refused to place himself on the scale of time that reaches thousands
and millions of years into the future as well as into the past.
Looked at
from the vantage point of 8,000 years hence - approximately the period of
recorded history - man's progress up to the present time may appear far less
impressive than it does today." 48
48 Gallup, George, The Miracle Ahead, New York Evanston and London, Harper
and Row, 1964, p.ix
In the early 20th century, most scientists theoretically agreed that the
airplane was probably impossible. However, the Wright Brothers were too busy
bolting a gas engine to some wings in their bicycle shop to care about
erroneous opinions. Soon after, they defied the authorities and invented the
once considered impossible "flying machine".
The fact is, when a scientist tells you something is possible, he is likely
correct. However, when he states something is impossible, he is likely
wrong. Science and technology have continued to defy prior assumptions of
possibility, and will continue to do so.
It can safely be assumed that
whatever the future holds from a technological standpoint, it will likely
seem impossible and "ridiculous" from the standpoint of today's
understandings and methods.
Process
Now, coming back to our larger point, the three attributes of personal and
social evolution are thus:
-
our GOALS
-
the METHOD of thought
-
the TOOLS to get it done
We define our goals based on what we value, we utilize
The Scientific Method
to solve problems and to create/test hypothesis, and we harness technology
to make the goal a reality. It is important to point out that this
generalization is not linear and each part has an influence on all other
parts.
For instance, our values are often altered by advents in technology,
along with the logical reasoning of the scientific method. If a person is
brought up with a value system of "helping the poor" and then finds him or
herself in an environment where no poor exist, possibly due to technological
advancement, this value would have no basis to exist.
In the end, our ever-changing values are the most important attribute
affecting our social evolution.
The only relevant values are those that work
to improve society and those that hinder its development.
Summary of Chapter 4
Our approach to social evolution begins with our values. Our values are
combinations of personal reflections on our acquired knowledge, coupled with
the traditionalized, cultural indoctrinations we are born into.
As time
moves forward, our values change.
Sadly, most of the values people have
today come from a social system that is largely out of date in terms of its
relationship to modern science and technology. The process of accomplishment
consists of: knowing what we want (Goals), thinking about the material in
the most effective and hence, scientific way (Method), and using our most
effective technological instruments to make that goal become a reality
(Tools).
The valued goals of The Zeitgeist Movement and hence
The Venus
Project, are to redesign society for the benefit of all humanity, making
sure there is enough of everything for everyone, maximizing personal freedom
and happiness, while constantly reducing offensive social behavior, or
crime.
These values can only be accomplished using the intelligent and
humane methods of science and the tools of technology.
In the next section,
we will show how.
Part 3
A Resource Based Economy
Chapter 5: Social Cybernation
"We call for a straightforward redesign of
our culture, in which the age-old inadequacies of war, poverty, hunger,
debt and unnecessary human suffering are viewed not only as avoidable,
but also as totally unacceptable. Anything less simply results in a
continuation of the same catalog of problems inherent in the present
system." 49
Jacque Fresco
49 Fresco, Jacque,
The Best That Money Can't Buy: Beyond Politics, Poverty
and War - 2002
The time has come for a restructuring of our world society.
The cause of
this need is not some creative interest or intellectual ambition. The cause
is the failing monetary structure, increasing world poverty and conflict,
the constant corruption generated by the pursuit of profit and the continual
poisoning of the planet and ourselves by the commercial industry at large.
We stand at the crossroads.
Either we take responsibility for our lives and
for society itself, or we pay the price. The more we continue within this
outdated system, the more unstable things are going to become.
The Venus Project
In this section, we are going to discuss The Venus Project.
The Venus
Project, which constitutes the life long work of social engineer and
structural designer Jacque Fresco, is an organization that wants nothing
less than a peaceful and sustainable global civilization. It seeks to update
society to present day knowledge and modern methods. Its tenets are
essentially based on the application of Science and Technology for human and
social concern.
The social structure it advocates is called a Resource-Based
Economy.
A Resource-Based Economy utilizes existing resources rather than commerce.
All goods and services are available without the use of currency, credit,
barter or any form of debt or servitude. The aim of this new social design
is to free humanity from the repetitive, mundane and arbitrary occupational
roles which hold no true relevance for social development, while encouraging
a new incentive system that is focused on self-fulfillment, education,
social awareness and creativity, as opposed to the shallow and self-centered
goals of wealth, property and power which are dominant today.
The Venus
Project recognizes that the earth is abundant with resources, and that our
outdated methods of rationing resources through monetary control are no
longer relevant. In fact, they are very counterproductive to our survival.
The monetary system was created thousands of years ago during periods of
great scarcity. Its initial purpose was contrived as a method of
distributing goods and services based on labor contributions.
It is not at
all related to our true capacity to produce goods and services on this
planet.
As was discussed in Chapter 2, advancing technology is now phasing out the
role of humans in the economic labor force. This paradigm shift is going to
alter society one way or another.
It will either lead us unto a new social
system which does not require human servitude for income; where society is
designed as a whole to benefit itself with the use of advanced technology
being purposefully accelerated for social betterment
or we will likely be
led down the path of chaos and disorder,
where unemployment is rampant, crime is epidemic, draconian police state
measures are introduced to suppress dissent and environmental resources
become more exploited and destroyed.
Physical survival and quality of life are based solely on our use,
management and preservation of the earth's resources. Now, with our
ever-growing scientific ingenuity to utilize those resources in the most
humane, technologically constructive and efficient ways, the tradition of
labor for money and money for resources no longer has a logical basis.
The
intelligent management of the earth's resources is what is important. In a
saner world, we would take account of the dynamic equilibrium within our
global ecosystem, and adjust our production process accordingly.
Furthermore, a Resource-Based Economy would need to be global by nature, for
the ultimate utilization of the planet is an organization worldwide. The
planet can only be diligently examined and operated from a holistic
perspective. This isn't subjective. The Earth is essentially a tool kit,
full of possibilities for us to create an abundance of technology, food and
energy. If we do not keep track of all planetary resources and view the
planet as a synergistic whole, our abilities will be limited.
Sadly, the
world today is divided by,
...making it currently
difficult to organize a global resource management system. This is another
reason why the monetary system, in and of itself, is detrimental to our
survival, for it inherently limits cooperation amongst tribes.
As far as
ideologies, it is time we put aside our religious and nationalistic
differences and realize that we are all here on the same planet, needing the
same basic things. It is only when the world works together that
sustainability and true progress will be achieved.
More on this problem of
ideological division will be discussed in Chapter 7.
Industry and Labor
Again, as expressed previously, statistics have shown that human beings are
increasingly being replaced by automated machines in the workforce, causing
unemployment and hence a reduction in the purchasing power of its citizenry.
Over time, as this phenomenon progresses, a tipping point will occur when
the lack of consumer purchasing power will destroy the monetary based
economy, for it won't matter how cost effective the production companies
are
people will simply not have any money to buy the items with, thus
ending the mechanism of 'cyclical consumption'.
Those who are aware of this,
often attempt to create solutions within the monetary system, usually
suggesting some form of 'hyper-welfare socialist state", where the rich
elite own the factories, a virtually non-existent middle class (perhaps 5%
of the world's population) works to oversee the machine operations, while
the rest of the world is given money to use, in the form of hand outs from
the government.
This type of idea is nothing but horrifying and absurd. It
would lead to dictatorship, extreme liberty restrictions and great public
anger, for the stratification of class is still there, giving those at the
top access to more resources than the billions at the bottom.
Consequently, we are now seeing a deliberate stifling and withholding of
technological development for the sake of keeping people employed. It is
like having an electronic drill available on a job, but instead you use a
manual drill because you want to get paid for more hours. This is
fundamentally counterproductive. It is nothing but insanity to slow/ignore
technological development in order to preserve an outdated social system.
The entire point of technology is to free humanity from labor itself! We
need a social design that focuses on maximizing our technological abilities
for the sake of freeing humanity from drudgery and increasing productivity
to its highest potential. Anything less is unacceptable.
Now, for the sake
of argument, let's completely forget about our current monetary based social
system and take a fresh look at modern industrial production methods, as
would be implemented in a Resource-Based Economy.
The question is how would
we design a production system that maximizes high quality output, reduces
waste, considers the dynamic equilibrium of the biosphere, and reduces
repetitive and mechanical human labor?
Based on The Scientific Method, here
is how the logical reasoning for industrial production methods would unfold:
-
Step 1: Survey the planetary resources
As discussed in the last chapter, it
is critical that we know what we have on this planet, for that translates
into what the possibilities are. With this information, industrial
production is always adjusted to compensate for any emerging scarcity, along
with the most mathematically appropriate raw material distribution, based on
availability and its most relevant application.
Any scarce resource is
immediately addressed by seeking alternatives and substitutes. This
awareness can be obtained by real-time electronic feedback coming from all
resource sectors of the planet, fed into a central computer database that
monitors any growing scarcity or problem. This idea of world resource
monitoring is not far fetched, even if it might sound complex. In fact, the
US military and Pentagon already have satellites and ocean monitors for the
purpose of defense.
These instruments could simply be reoriented for the
purpose of environmental monitoring rather than human monitoring.
-
Step 2: Decide on what production is required
What do we need? This is a
very powerful question, for, besides food, water and shelter, most on the
planet today have no idea what they really want or need, for they have never
been informed as to the true state of technology.
What we think we need is a
direct result of the state of society's awareness of technological
development. For instance, a person 300 years ago might need a needle and
thread to fix a torn shirt.
Today, they would think they need an electronic
sewing machine
yet
. more accurately, what they really need is a kind of
shirt material that doesn't tear easily or at all. Someone who has dust in
his or her home would think, "I need a vacuum cleaner". Are they sure?
Perhaps what they actually need is a household pressure system that does not
enable dust to enter or is equipped with electrostatic air filters that
eliminate what little dust there is and destroys air borne bacteria. In
other words, if we critically examine what we think we need in a material
sense, we can begin to see that needs are always in transition.
Science and
technology are barometers of utilitarian human need, and therefore all
products that are created should be as advanced as is technologically
possible. Our current monetary system, which generates wasteful, outdated
products constantly just to keep industry and the economy going, does not
have the ability or the desire to produce the most advanced tools for our
use.
This is because the majority of the products produced would not even
exist if industry focused on what would best serve the needs of society.
-
Step 3: Optimization of production methods | maximizing product lifespan
If
I was going to build a desk for myself, I would try to make sure that desk
would last as long as possible. This makes sense, right? If the desk breaks,
that means I would have to build another one, at the cost of more materials
and more labor. It would seem logical that everything produced in society
would have the longest possible life span that is technically possible.
Sadly, the exact opposite occurs in our current system, for, as previously
discussed, the current monetary system thrives on multiplicity and planned
obsolescence. Without it, the whole economy would collapse. This mechanism
of the monetary system is nothing but detrimental. How anyone can sit back
and defend the Monetary System's propensity for waste is horrifying. In a
saner world, we will make things that last.
The optimization of production
methods is about using the most powerful materials and methods, while
outputting the most long lasting and effective products. Human labor is not
only currently being replaced by machines because it is more cost effective
within the profit system, machine labor is exceedingly better than human
labor, and output statistics have shown this continually - Industrial
productivity increases when machine labor replaces human labor.
This, of
course, should be no surprise, for a machine does not get tired and it is
always more accurate and consistent than a human, mechanically.
High-efficiency labor automation, coupled with scientifically managed
resources (as denoted in chapter 3) will allow for a fluid, scarcity-less
environment which could be operated by only a very small fraction of the
population.
-
Step 4: Distribution methods for human access
Distribution methods would
also depend on the state of technology. For instance, production could
eventually become so streamlined, that a product is only created when the
request is made by a person in need. Regardless, warehouse like distribution
centers, along with automated delivery would be the most simplistic way for
now.
Also, since there is no money used in this system, there is little need
for a person to hoard their items. There is also no reason for a person to
steal something that is available to everyone
and they certainly couldn't
sell it. In light of the fact that all goods in a Resource-Based Economy are
designed to last as long as possible, the consumer culture values that exist
today would also be outgrown.
Not to mention the outgrowth of all of the
other value distortions imposed by advertising today, which make people feel
greedy, inferior or inept due to what they do and don't own. Advertising
would not exist in this new system, outside of general product information
available to people who think they might need it. To obtain a product, a
person would likely go online, search for the item's function, select the
item and request it.
It would be available for pickup or delivery soon
after.
-
Step 5: Optimized Recycling of the products that become outdated or
inoperable
This step actually begins at the production stage, for each
product designed has had incorporated into it the consideration of recycling
in advance. Ideally, everything produced would be sustainable and
recyclable.
This strategic consideration would ensure that obsolete products
would be reused, reducing waste, to the maximum extent possible.
Now, one of the more difficult and confusing components for many to consider
in regard to the above 5 steps for our Resource-Based Economy's new
industrial production methodology, has to do with number 3 and the use of
machines for replacing human labor in as many areas as possible. The
question of, " Who will maintain the machines?" is common.
This will be
addressed in a moment.
However, let's briefly review the history and application of machine
automation and computer technology.
The first major automated robot, the Unimate from
Unimation Inc., had a work
envelope of 350 cubic feet. It occupied 20 square feet of floor space. The Unimate was deployed for the first time in 1961 at the General Motors
Corporation plant in Trenton, New Jersey, where it unloaded a die- casting
machine. Six years later, GM was using the Unimate for spot welding and
attaching clips to seat frames. In 1970, the automaker built the first
automated spot welding line, consisting of 28
robots.50
Those who were in the business of making these machines knew
exactly what the implications were.
In 1962, John Snyder, the president of
U.S. Industries, Inc., a manufacturer of automated equipment, set up the,
"Foundation on Automation and Employment" to try to "develop ways to ease
automation's impact on displaced workers."
He once stated:
"I want to sell the automation machines that
my company makes, but if our economy turns sour, if the unemployment
problem is not solved, I will have difficulty selling them and no reason
to make them. To my way of thinking, all businessmen should share this
view--that the unemployment problem and the automation problem are as
serious for business as for labor." 51
In 1946, the first general-purpose electronic computer was developed - called
ENIAC. This computer has 18,000 radio tubes, took up 680 square feet and
weighed more than 30 tons.52 Penn professor Irving Brainerd once speculated
that during the 80,223 hours ENIAC operated, it crunched more calculations
than had been performed by all humanity since time began.53
Now, a computer chip measuring 0.02 inches (0.5 mm) square has the same
performance power as the ENIAC.54

Barnes, 1969, p. 72
Now, machinery today is being combined with computerization. Essentially,
the computer is the brain of the machine and instructs the machine in terms
of what it is to do. This combination of machine and computer intelligence
could be termed: Cybernation.
Cybernated machines today are probably the
most powerful and influential inventions humanity has ever created. The
possibilities of these tools are on pace to change the entire fabric of
society
beginning first with the freeing of the human labor force.
In the words of Albert Einstein:
"Ultimate automation
will make our modern
industry as primitive and outdated as the stone age man looks to us
today." 55
This reality is not something we should fight. We should embrace it
emphatically. Cybernation is the Emancipation Proclamation for human kind,
freeing us from the drudgery of common labor, opening new horizons for human
potential and exploration.
In the words of Dr. Norbert Wiener, noted "Father of Cybernation":
"It is a degradation to human beings to
chain them to an oar and use them as a source of power, but it is almost
an equal degradation to assign them to purely repetitive tasks in a
factory which demands less than a millionth of their brain power." 56
These Cybernated Machines far exceed the physical accuracy of a human being,
while also being able to compute at incredible rates, also far exceeding the
computational speed and capacity of the human brain.
Now, for those who have
been indoctrinated by science fiction to think that these new machines might
gain "consciousness" and "take over the human race", it should be understood
that this has zero basis in reality. Cybernated Machines are nothing more
than creative extensions of human performance. Just as a hammer will help
you drive a nail into a strip of wood, a Cybernated Machine will perform
complex tasks easing the process to obtain a particular goal. The machines
do as they are programmed, and nothing more.
In the words of Arthur C. Clarke:
"The popular idea, fostered by comic
strips and the cheaper forms of science fiction, that intelligent machines
must be malevolent entities hostile to man, is so absurd that it is hardly
worth wasting energy to refute it. I am almost tempted to argue that only
unintelligent machines can be malevolent
Those who picture machines as active enemies
are merely projecting their own aggressive[ness]. The higher the
intelligence, the greater the degree of cocooperativeness. If there is
ever a war between men and machines, it is easy to guess who will start
it." 57
56 Fresco, Jacque, The Best That Money Can't Buy, Global Cybervisions, 2002,
p. 54
57 Clarke, Arthur C., Profiles of the Future, NY Harper & Row, 1964,
pp.226-227
Now, a very common reaction to the idea of machines taking over the role of
human labor is to distrust the idea due to our daily problems with
technology today. From cars breaking down, to personal computers freezing,
society today seems to have a love-hate relationship with technology.
Well,
first of all, as denoted before, in a monetary system everything produced is
designed to break down, for everything is a product. Even NASA with its
extreme need for the best materials and technology has a budget to deal
with, and must cut corners if need be. Your cars and personal computers
don't stand a chance.
Both industries have a massive sub-industry for
repairs and maintenance. If computers and cars were not designed to break
down, tens of millions of jobs would be lost worldwide in these sectors
alone.
Ultimately, the first step towards ensuring that the Cybernated Machines we
devise are made of the highest quality components and programming would
require that we outgrow the monetary system, for it prevents their
efficiency and sustainability. There is no reason why everything in your
home, from your refrigerator to your stove, to your television, to your
computer, could not last your entire lifetime without physical repair.
How
can that be said with confidence?
Because the best materials
available on this planet, such as Titanium, have sustainable properties that
far exceed the life span of a person by thousands of years. Products made
today are made out of the cheapest possible materials in order to increase
profit margins. Today you will find that most general products in the
consumer industry are created in whole, or in part, out of plastic.
Plastic
is one of the cheapest synthetic materials available. It has no heat
tolerance, is often too brittle and it weathers very quickly so, of
course, everything breaks down
that is the intent.
In a saner world, this would not be tolerated and the industrial machines
devised would not only have extreme durability and long life spans, the
advanced machines will eventually be able to repair themselves. In cars
today, there are often warning lights on the dashboard that will alert you
to a problem with a particular part of the car.
This idea can be expanded to
all machinery to the degree where not only is the machine's on board
computer 'aware' of a problem, supplemental machines can thereby be directed
to replace the broken part in real time.
Even more advanced, are material
technologies such as 'shape memory alloys'. These metals can literally
remember their shape. In the event that a machine's physical structure
becomes damaged, an electronic current can be sent through that section,
instantly correcting the structure. The bottom line here is that
self-repairing machines and structures are growing realities.
The problem is
that the production of such efficiency is not rewarded in the monetary
system, so most people in society have no idea of what is actually possible.
In the words of Thorstein Veblen:
"If the country's productive industry were
completely organized as a systematic whole, and was then managed by
competent technicians
to maximize production of goods and services
instead of, as now, being mishandled by ignorant businessmen
to
maximize profits, the resulting output of goods and services would
doubtless exceed the current output of goods and services by several
hundred percent." 58

1921, pp.120-121
Now, the role humans will play within the high-tech, cybernetic, automated
industrial production plant of the future will be that of supervisors and
nothing more.
Once the Cybernated Industrial System is set up, it is simply a matter of
updating the system and making sure the system is in order. As time moves
forward, we can only expect that the rate of our technological capabilities
will continue to increase.
But what about complex jobs, such as doctors, architects and the like?
We have to ask ourselves,
"What is the true nature of our occupational
roles?"
What exactly is a doctor, a carpenter, a plumber, an architect, or the like
actually doing in their work?
They recognize and react to observed patterns.
When a doctor examines you, all he or she is doing is referencing what he or
she has learned. If you go to a dermatologist because you think you might
have cancer on your arm, the doctor examines the skin and mentally
references the patterns he or she has been taught.
Then he or she might take
a sample of the skin to be tested by machine analysis. It is a 'technical'
process. There is no reason why an optical scanner could not be invented
that can scan your arm and immediately understand what the condition might
be. A modern programmed computer with optical technology is not limited by
the spectrum of the human eye; it has a memory and processing capacity that
far exceed a human's.
Even surgery, as sensitive as it may seem to us today,
is a purely technical process. It is simply a matter of time before
extremely advanced machines replace surgeons. It is already beginning to
happen in certain areas. The same goes for every other utilitarian
occupation in existence. A 'carpenter' is a person who is hired to fix or
create a certain kind of structure.
While there might be so called
"creative" elements to the carpenter's ways, he is still basing his
decisions on physics, geometry and modern materials. If you want to build a
deck, the first thing you need to know is the best available materials to
use and then apply the highest integrity methodology to those materials.
Those understandings are completely technical and without the need for human
opinion.
And this brings us to a very critical realization
one that will
have a profound effect on our progress on this planet:
The delegation of decision making to computers
is the next step
The utilitarian roles that humans assume in society today are fundamentally
technical by nature. This seems obvious in regard to physical labor, for we
have already seen machines replace the role of humans in areas such as
factories and construction.
However, unrecognized by most, our mental labor
is now being delegated to computers as well. If this sounds foreign to you,
please note that if you have ever used a calculator, you have delegated your
decision making to a machine.
We must remember that logical reasoning, which is our cognitive ability to
think out solutions to problems from a cause and effect standpoint, is
entirely a technical process, based on the amount of information we have at
any one time. For example, if we have a problem with our car, we would go to
a mechanic and he would use his pattern recognition abilities and
associative memory to consider the possibilities that might have caused the
problem, along with the possibilities for solving the problem, based on
reasoning. It is an objective, technical process.
However, a mechanic's
human brain is only capable of a certain amount of memory and intellectual
processing power. A modern, programmed machine on the other hand, can store
tremendously more data than a human, and can consistently and rapidly
process information without getting tired or lazy. For instance, let's
assume we have programmed a computer with the data set consisting of the car
in question.
A computer has been programmed to know every component, every
screw and every electronic pathway, etc., of that vehicle. It has also been
programmed with the application of physics so it can relate to the actual
cause and effect functionality and operation of the machine, not just its
parts. When the car is taken in for repair, the mechanic recognizes the
physical properties as best he can, and then he goes over to this computer,
selects the model of the car and inputs a description of the problem.
He
might input, "left headlight not working".
The computer would then
immediately present a list of all relevant issues related to the headlight,
and then present a series of framed questions to the mechanic that most
logically attempt to locate the cause.
The computer might say:
"Check the
connection of cable 15b", and then show a diagram of where that component is
located in the car.
If the mechanic finds that isn't the problem, he inputs
that new information into the computer and the computer goes to the next
logical possibility.
The computer is really making the decisions
the
mechanic is just orienting its focus. The bottom line here is that there
really is no area of human operation that cannot be highly perfected by
delegating decision-making processes to computer intelligence. In fact, the
only thing that now separates us from machines on a cognitive, utilitarian
level is our ability to create complex associations in our mind.
No computer
today has yet to respond effectively to being "asked a complex question" in
the English language. It requires that the language be transformed into one
that it is programmed to understand, such as mathematics. However, new
fields, such as 'Artificial Intelligence', (AI) are beginning to grow with
incredible possibilities for this kind of "awareness".
In time, computers
will be able to achieve complex thought processes that were formerly only
attributed to humans. There is no evidence to support the contrary.
In the next section we will describe how this new human option to delegate
our labor and decision making to a highly efficient computerized system is
what will constitute the replacement of the institution of traditional
"Government".
Government
"[The] tremendous and still accelerating development of science and
technology has not been accompanied by an equal development in social,
economic, and political patterns
We are now
only beginning to explore the
potentialities which it offers for developments in our culture outside
technology, particularly in the social, political and economic fields.
It is safe to predict that
such social
inventions as modern-type Capitalism, Fascism, and Communism will be
regarded as primitive experiments directed toward the adjustment of
modern society to modern methods" 59
Dr. Ralph
Linton
59 Linton, Ralph, The Tree of Culture (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1959, pp
47-8)
First of all, Government, as we know it, is a byproduct of environmental
scarcity. Like mafia tribes, the governments of the world seek to preserve
their current positions of power, while aggressively working to strengthen
their economic advantage.
As far as social management, all a government can
basically do is make laws, establish budgets, and declare wars. They are
really monetary system creations. Sadly, due to the very nature of their
power, history has become one constant chain of governmental corruption,
ranging from the genocidal slaughter of peoples in opposing nations, to the
deliberate oppression of a country's own people in order to maintain the
established order.
The reason why all governments on the planet are corrupt
is because they have to be in this system. Remember, they are no different
than corporations, trying to survive in the monetary system. They are all in
competition with each other, with periodic "world empires" emerging every
couple hundred years or so.
In order for any traditional government to keep control over its people, it
must push a unified value system. If the leaders of a country want the
public to support its wars, they will put statues of "great war heroes" in
parks and have the media push the 'nobleness' of the military. They also
very often cite "god" and allude to their wars as being some form of battle
against "evil".
This manipulation keeps an uninformed public on
'their side'
with a narrow worldview.
In the words of Albert Einstein:
"Patriotism is a disease."
For a person to say something like,
"The USA is the best country
on earth" is exactly the same as saying "White people are God's chosen
race".
Patriotism is racism with a flag
nothing more. The fact is,
Government decisions today are based on the narrow self-interest of an
elite, just like the corporations. This is nothing but destructive and
unsustainable.
As stated before, the more we think about our problems on this planet, from
the poverty in Africa, to the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest, we see
that every problem in life is actually technical by nature.
Because of this, there is little reason for traditional opinions in the
solving of any problem, for our technical insight can now arrive at most
answers using The Scientific Method along with all known variables relative
to the problem. If a person reads one page of a book and closes it, he or
she can easily have an "opinion" on that book as a whole. If another reads
the whole book, he or she might also have an opinion.
Whose opinion would
you value more? The person who read the full book, or the person who has
only read one page?
In other words, the more information taken into account
in the process of decision-making, the more accurate that decision will be.
As discussed earlier, computerized machines now have the ability to perform
better than humans in both physical and mental areas. Our minds do not
technically compare to computers that can access trillions of bits of
information across vast informational databases, and compute output results
near the speed of light.
The transfer of decision making to machine
intelligence is the next phase of social evolution. It greatly reduces human
error, and removes dangerous biases, subjectivity and opinion. Because of
the limitations of the sensory and cortical equipment in our body and mind,
no one can know everything in this world. Our senses are limited in range.
Our eyes can only see a fraction of the electromagnetic field
therefore it
is only logical that we delegate decision making to machines, for they do
not have these restrictions. Computers, used as tools, can/will be able to
solve problems, which humans simply cannot due to our physical and mental
limitations. It is no different than a person who uses a pair of glasses to
see.
Glasses are a technological tool
an extension of the human being that
helps a person see better than they would normally. Cybernated Machines are
nothing different. They are simply extensional tools that expand our
abilities. The human species has the powerful ability to improve itself
through technological invention.
We must realize this and maximize its
potential.
In a Resource-Based Economy, people do not make decisions; they arrive at
them through the use of advanced technological tools that incorporate The
Scientific Method. There is no 'Republican' or 'Liberal' way to design an
airplane
so why do we use these outdated worldviews in society today? When
we recognize that society is a technological invention, with its component
variables really no different than the component variables of an airplane,
we then see that our orientation towards so called "government" should be
purely scientific.
'Politics' is now outdated, for its processes are largely
subjective and without scientific reference. Politics is an outgrowth of the
monetary system and scarcity. We now must work towards a new, emerging
paradigm moving from a period where the central problem was the sharing of
scarcity, to the problem now being one of creating and distributing
abundance.
Government and the concept of the "State" will eventually be outgrown
entirely and replaced by an objective system of global resource management
and technological organization. In a system of abundance, the "State", as we
know it, has no basis to exist.
Government also becomes a Cybernated System,
which is combined with Industry and thus responsible for the production and
distribution of goods, along with resource and environmental management.
The
structural basis for this "government" system is idealized as follows:
-
A central database containing catalogs of every known material and
technical understanding for problem solving and invention. As noted
previously, computers have the ability to catalog information and logically
compute it on a scale much larger than a human can. Only computers will be
able to handle the integration of all known knowledge and come up with
decisions that will be logically based on the full known range of data.
As
stated before, the most efficient decisions are decisions that have been
arrived at by taking into account all relevant variables. It is now within
our grasp today to begin the development of a Central Computer Database that
contains all known knowledge, ranging from the properties, combinations and
applications of every element on the periodic table, to the complete known
history of technological invention.
Once the associative system emerges,
which will allow computers to contextually cross-relate all the known
disciplines, we will have in our grasp a tool of immeasurable proportions.
The limitations of our physical and cognitive abilities will no longer be a
problem, for the new method of problem solving and invention will be an
interaction with this database program. It could even come in the form of a
simple website on the Internet, in fact.
You would pose a problem or
question to the database program and it will give the best feedback that is
possible based on the current state of knowledge at that period in time.
Again, this process of inquiry and interaction is no different than
interfacing with a calculator, but this new "calculator" has a powerful
associative system and an extensive database of knowledge that can not just
understand and compute math, it can integrate physics, biology, astronomy
and every scientific field into one concentrated awareness.
Most likely, the
US Military already has similar database reference and decision making
programs that it uses to strategize for war. Regardless, in order for this
system to be effective, it must also have real-time feedback input from the
planet, in order to understand what resources we have and what we don't.
This requires a worldwide sensory system. In other words:
-
An earth wide autonomic nervous system, with environmental sensors in all
relevant areas of the planet, generating "Industrial Electronic Feedback"
regarding resources, operations and other environmental issues.
This nervous
system is connected directly to the Central Database Program noted above.
This holistic system keeps track of all the resources on the planet, while
also monitoring the earth for environmental disturbances which humanity
should be alerted to, such as earthquakes and other natural phenomenon.
This
database would include a survey of available resources, production plants,
scientific and technical personnel, transportation, research labs, medical
facilities, schools, etc. This will not happen overnight, but if we began by
constructing regional systems and overtime interlink all of them globally,
it could be created sooner than we think.
This integration can inform the
Central Database Program of what is available and what is scarce, while the
Database will in turn constantly adjust industrial methods based around the
dynamic equilibrium of the planet. Of course, full international cooperation
is the only way to accomplish such a system.
This issue will be discussed in
Chapter 9.
-
Interdisciplinary Teams of technicians oversee the system and orient
research projects to continue growth, efficiency and social evolution. In an
optimized version of this system, no more than 5% of the population would
likely be needed to run the show.
The more optimized and powerful our
technology and methods become, the more that number decreases.
Of course, many people often ask, what about democracy? Is this system a
democracy? How do I participate in the system? Do we elect the
Interdisciplinary teams?
In a Resource-Based, Global Economy, where "industry" and "government" are
combined into a Cybernated System that incorporates advanced problem solving
database computers, coupled with vast planetary wide observation sensors,
the traditional concepts of politics, elections and the like have no
relevance or basis.
While this notion scares a lot of traditionally minded
people, it must be reiterated that our problems in life are technical, and
nothing more.
Democracy in today's world is an illusion. It always was.
People think they have "choice" in our current system because they can press
a button on a voting machine and put some pre-selected person into power.
Once that person is in power, the public then has no power.
-
Did you vote for
the space program?
-
Did you vote for the cabinet of the new president?
-
Did
you vote for the tax cut?
-
Did you vote for where highways or power grids go?
-
Did you vote for the war in Iraq?
No, you didn't...
The traditional concept of
a "participatory democracy" is a cruel joke. The game has been used to give
the public the illusion of control for countless generations, while the
distorted monetary powers at the top continue to do whatever they please.
There never was a true democracy in any country in history and there never
will be as long as the monetary system is in operation and scarcity is
perpetuated.
So how would a person participate within a Resource-Based Economy?
First,
they would interact with the Central Database System program, which would
likely come in the form of an advanced Internet web page which every person
has access to.
They would then input their proposal. The Central Database,
with its historical knowledge databases and full integration of all
scientific fields, would then analyze the concept for its scientific and
technical integrity along with optimizing the materials required based on
current understandings and availabilities. If the proposal makes logical
sense and the optimized resources to make it happen are available, it would
be turned over to the Interdisciplinary Teams that oversee the
implementation of the new proposal and orient it into the system.
These Interdisciplinary Teams would be selected and organized by the Central
Database Program, based on what they have already contributed to the system.
This is a true "election", based on what a person has done, not what they
say they will do.
Furthermore, the public's fear of traditional "corruption" will have no
basis, for there is no reward for it. The Interdisciplinary Teams do not get
"paid" in any way, for their worldviews have been expanded to realize that
their reward is, in fact, the fruits of the society as a whole and they
contribute because they want to! While this might be difficult to consider
for those who have been
fully indoctrinated into the monetary based reward system and feel that
money is the only "incentive" there is, let it be known that every day, all
over the world, millions of humans volunteer for the greater good. In a 1992
Gallop Poll, more than 50% of American adults (94 Million Americans)
volunteered time for social causes, at an average of 4.2 hours a week, for a
total of 20.5 billion hours a year! 60
This is an incredible triumph for the
collective human spirit, for even with the sickness of self-interest
generated by the monetary system, humans still strive to help each other and
give to society without reward. In the future, those who choose to work in
the Cybernated Industrial System will do so because it is an honor to serve
humanity.
They will understand that it is in their self-interest to see to
it that humanity lives and works together for the greater good. The reward
in a Resource-Based Economy would be the continual improvement of society
for all.
In the words of
Margaret Mead:
"If you look closely you will see that
almost anything that really matters to us, anything that embodies our
deepest commitment to the way human life should be lived and cared for,
depends on some form of volunteerism." 61
60 Hodgkinson & Weitzman, Giving and Volunteering in the United States:
Findings from a National Survey, 1992, p2
61 Krikorian, Robert "Have you
noticed
", Vital Speeches of the day, 1985, p 301
In a Resource-Based Economy, participation is open to everyone, because all
issues are fundamentally recognized as technical. The degree to which a
person contributes is based simply on that person's education and ability to
create and problem solve.
This is why expanded education is critical. In
society today, the public is always kept uninformed and as dumbed-down as
possible. This way the government can maintain control. In a Resource-Based
Economy, the goal of the educational system is to produce the most
intelligent and aware human beings as possible.
Why?
Because everyone can
then become a contributor, greatly affecting our social evolution for the
better and improving the lives of all.
Summary of Chapter 5
Who makes the decisions in a Resource-Based Economy? No one does.
Decisions
are arrived at by the use of The Scientific Method, utilizing computers that
gain real-time feedback from the environment, along with a Central
Historical Database of all known technical information, and maintained by
evolving Interdisciplinary Teams. This combination could be called the Cybernated Industrial System. This reduces erroneous opinions and
subjectivity. We don't want people in control of government.
We want to
utilize Scientific Methods for arriving at more appropriate decisions. In
the end, the only real issues for society in the natural world are:
-
the
production of goods and services that are equally available to all
-
research projects and educational systems to expand our knowledge,
understandings and applications
-
the constant monitoring of the
earth's resources
and atmosphere for feedback and possible environmental problems, enabling us
to restore and maintain a pristine environment
Without the wasted energy
and resources from going to war and other aspects of the monetary system, we
could address true threats to humanity, such as unforeseen variables like
tsunamis, earthquakes, illness and disease.
The only real problems in life
are the problems that are common to all humans.
Chapter 6: Cities that Think
Anthropologists often consider the city as our most fundamental social
invention. The first known city is thought to have occurred about 5400 BCE
in
ancient Sumeria. Since then, we have seen vast technological evolution in
the processes and materials used to create the components of a city, along
with advanced integrations of 'social' conventions, such as electrical
systems, water distribution methods and the like.
However, today's cities,
as modern as they may seem, are in fact extremely outdated in the face of
modern technology and scientific ingenuity.
It is time that we fully harness a systems approach to our city designs. The
term "systems" is derived from the Greek word "synistanai," which means, "to
bring together or combine."
A systems approach thus means that the
'elements' of the city, such as houses, power generators and production
facilities, be intricately interconnected to the 'processes' of the cities,
being waste disposal, irrigation, power distribution, goods and services
production, etc. In a Resource-Based Economy, the cities are designed to be
extremely flexible, allowing for constant upgrades and changes.
They are
emergent, fully integrated systems designed to evolve like a living
organism.
Jacque Fresco's innovative, multidimensional and circular city
designs would use the most sophisticated resources and construction
techniques. However, they require that we start fresh. Trying to fix our
current cities is not worth the time, material and effort. It is much less
problematic and effective to build newer cities from the ground up than to
restore old ones.
The design and development of these new cities emphasize
the restoration and protection of the environment and efficiently apply
resources with energy conservation, ease of fabrication, and relative
freedom from maintenance.
Many of the old, inefficient cities will be mined
for resources, while others will be kept as museum cities.
The Circular City
Model by Jacque Fresco
Photo by Roxanne Meadows
The circular city permits the most efficient use of resources, travel
techniques, and general functionality, with a minimum expenditure of energy.
The geometrically elegant circular arrangement is designed to allow for the
highest standard of living in the most productive and efficient ways
possible. These cities serve the role of extensions of human activity and
utilitarian expression; in compete harmony with the environment. The
configuration of these cities would be a direct representation of the
function they serve.
For instance, the outermost perimeter of the city is for nature-oriented
recreation, including lush gardens and parks for hiking, cycling, water
sports and any other outdoor activity. The next inner section is the
'agricultural belt', using outdoor and indoor (hydroponic) agricultural
methods so food can be grown all year round.
Continuing in, eight green
areas provide clean renewable energy sources for the entire city.
While
these energy sources would be region specific, often these methods will
include Geothermal, Wind and Solar technologies, while those cities near
water would extend to utilize Wave and Tidal power. The largest of these
green areas is also the 'residential belt', containing unique homes and
apartments. The residences are constructed by extrusion technology and other
methods of high-tech prefabrication.
The days of bricks and wood being stuck
together are no more. Structures of the future can be near solid units,
extruded as a whole. All homes and apartment complexes are also virtually
self-contained systems. For instance, the outer surfaces of the structures
serve as photovoltaic generators, converting solar radiation directly into
electricity.
The homes are fire resistant, require little maintenance and
are impervious to water and other environmental influences. The effects of
floods, earthquakes and hurricanes are also considered and incorporated into
the design, respective of the characteristics of the region of the earth
employed. Moving in past the residential district are education, science and
research centers, along with production and distribution centers.
Automated
inventory systems would integrate the distribution centers and manufacturing
facilities in a highly coordinated and efficient way. Without the problem of
money and value, limits on production would not exist.
In the center of the city, there is a large dome that contains the Central Cyberneted System, which is the brain and nervous system of the entire city.
As denoted earlier in our section on 'government', through satellites and
sensors placed around the entire city, the core dome electronically monitors
the production and distribution of products, while also controlling
environmental factors within the system.
For example, in regard to the
agricultural belt, electronic probes monitor and maintain the soil
conditions, including the water table, nutrient allocation and other
attributes. This method of 'environmental feedback' is applied to the entire
city complex. This way a 'balanced load economy' can be maintained, with
overruns and waste eliminated.
Also, within this central dome is the central
transportation hub
more on this in a moment.
Surrounding the central dome,
are eight smaller domes that are used as culture centers, such a performance
venues, conference centers, exhibitions and the like. Waste recycling and
other such needs are located beneath the surface of the city, always
utilizing the most advanced methods in clean technology.
Apart from the Circular City, other city designs would include various
'land
city' configurations, 'total enclosure' cities, along with 'Cities in the
Sea'. Colonization of the oceans is likely the next stage for humanity in
order to relieve land based population pressures.
Oceanic city communities
will develop as artificial islands, floating structures and under sea
observatories.

The cities on earth, in whatever form they take, are all tightly
interconnected within a worldwide system.
Just as each city has a central
organizational dome which functions as the brain, along with its nervous
system consisting of computerized environmental monitoring via satellite and
electronic probes, the larger world complex absorbs each city and monitors
the broader spectrum of the environment, making sure there isn't a material
resource needed in any of the individual cities, while also regulating
larger order processes for all cities and the environment as a whole.
This
"government", if that is what you want to call it, is where the Central
Database is located, as denoted in the previous chapter, with its nervous
system stretching into all city complexes and beyond.

Transportation
Within the city, escalators and elevators, along with conveyers and
transveyors, move in all directions and are interconnected with all other
transport systems.
The transportation system is deliberately designed to
reduce the need for any kind of automobile. This system can take you
anywhere in the city. If you want to travel outside the city, monorails,
streamlined cars, vertical take off/landing aircraft and Maglev trains are
used for continental and intercontinental travel. Airports and International
shipping systems are also implemented in and around the cities.
It is worth pointing out that the prevailing means of transportation in our
societies today require fossil fuels to run. In the case of the automobile,
the battery technology needed to power an electric car that can go over 100
miles an hour and over 200 miles on one charge currently exists, and has
existed for many years.
However, due to battery patents controlled by the
oil industry, which limit their availability to maintain market share,
coupled with the political pressure from the profit based energy industry,
the accessibility and affordability of this technology is limited. There is
absolutely no reason, other than pure, corrupt profit interest, that every
single transport vehicle in the world could not be utterly clean, with zero
need for gasoline.
As far as traditional airplanes are concerned, Maglev technology is on pace
to making them obsolete.
A
Maglev train uses magnets for propulsion. It is
fully suspended by a magnetic field, and requires less than 2% of the energy
used for plane travel. The train has no wheels, so nothing can wear out.
These tube based Maglevs could travel up to 4000 miles per hour, in a
motionless, frictionless tube, which can go over land, or underwater.
They
are fast, clean, and efficient with only a fraction of the energy usage we
use today for the same means.

Lifestyle
In our current system, the traditional family is broken, with both parents
having to work in order to survive. Monetary economics undermines family
cohesion and childcare. Stress is always high due to medical bills,
insurance, education, employment insecurity and living costs.
In a Resource-Based Economy the integrity of the family will be returned.
Likewise, the cultural values of society as a whole would also undergo
profound change. With the monetary system outgrown and the world working
together to produce abundance for all the citizens of the planet, activities
we appreciate will expand greatly, for the amount of human freedom would be
unlike anything we know today.
Some often respond to these possibilities
with the question:
"What will people do?"
The answer is, of course, what you
like to do.
For many in our current society, options in life are very
limited due to the scarcity conditioning perpetuated. Within the monetary
system, the very idea of freedom is undermined, for a person is only as free
and their purchasing power will allow them to be. This stifles the creative
outlook of people and today many have an extremely limited frame of
reference as to what is possible.
For example, if a woman in ancient times
had the role of walking from her hut to a nearby creek to fetch water every
day for cooking, she would likely feel a displaced sense of responsibility
if suddenly there was a plumbing system in the house with a faucet that
brought the water to her directly. The fact is, advents in technology can
actually change our values and it is important that we 'update' our value
systems to reflect the modern period.
Concurrently, one of the more in depth changes in values and lifestyle will
be the way people think about 'property'. In most of the world today,
property is a powerful concept, with people often associating their social
status with what they own. As stated before, the monetary system requires 'cyclical consumption' to function. This naturally leads to the need for
people to be manipulated into thinking they want or need a particular good
or service.
With the powerful tactics of modern advertising, most in the
world support an artificial, materialistic value system that entails wanting
more and more goods and services, often regardless of their necessity or
utility. In a Resource-Based Economy, the monetary system will no longer
pollute the human mind via its manipulative arm - "advertising".
The endless
sea of billboards, media commercials, magazines and the like will no longer
poison the landscape or our perceptions. This will cause a dramatic shift in
the human value system and hence lifestyle.
More powerfully, in a Resource-Based Economy there is no reason for
property. Property is an outgrowth of scarcity. People who had to work very
hard to create or obtain a product or resource in turn protected it because
it had immense value relative to the labor entailed along with the scarcity
associated. Property is not an "American" or "Capitalist" idea
it is a
primitive mental perspective generated from generations of scarcity.
People
claim "ownership" because it is a legal form of protection.
In a system of abundance, without the need for money, the idea of ownership
becomes irrelevant. In this new system no one owns anything. Instead,
everyone has unrestricted access to everything. Ownership is a massive
burden. No longer will a person need to live in one place. One could travel
the world constantly. Anything needed is obtained, without restriction.
There is no reason for abuse for there is nothing to gain. You can't steal
things that no one owns and you certainly couldn't sell them. Household
items are obtained through central distribution in the cities, while
recreational items are available on call or near the location of their use.
For example, if you go to a golf course you would select, on site, your
clubs from the most effectively designed models available. You use them, and
then you return them.
If you decide to keep the clubs, go ahead - that is
your burden
for why would a person want to transport, maintain and store
golf clubs, when they can always have access to them and then return them
onsite?
Our homes today are full of junk that we hold onto because of the
supposed value they maintain. This waste will no longer be needed. In this
model, the city complex or, in fact, the entire world, is really your home.
Instead of having extraneous items like recreational equipment and vehicles
sitting about your physical house, collecting dust when they are not in use,
they are stored centrally for everyone's free access, with products being
utilized actively, minimizing redundant waste.
If you require an automobile
for whatever reason, the car is made available for you.
When you get to your
destination, the satellite based driving system will automatically make the
car available for others to use, as opposed to sitting in some parking lot
wasting space and time.
In society today, the need for property results in extreme product overlap
and redundant waste. There is no reason for every person to "own" a car.
Most only drive them for an hour a day.
It is much more intelligent to
create a universal shared system, for it dramatically reduces waste,
redundancy and increases space and efficiency.
Summary of Chapter 6
The cities within a Resource-Based Economy will fully utilize the systems
approach, integrating all elements and processes of the city into a
self-contained whole as is technically possible. We must start anew and not
concern ourselves with the chore of 'patching' the old cities, which are
intrinsically outdated.
While there are many designs possible, including
'Oceanic',
'Full Enclosure' and, of course, 'Land Cities', the Circular
City, as designed by Jacque Fresco, comprises one of the most efficient. Its
different circular tiers each operate as a component to the overall
functionality of the city, with room always for change, upgrades and
transition.
Lifestyles in a Resource-Based Economy will be very different
from the lifestyles of today, for the values of human beings will undergo
profound change once the influence of the scarcity-based monetary system
subsides. One of the more profound changes will be regarding our sense of
ownership and property. There will be no need or reason for property in the
future for importance will logically move from 'acquisition' to 'access'.
Everyone in the world will have access to their needs, with the entire
system based on making that possible.
Part 4
Overcoming Mythology
Chapter 7: Nature vs. Nurture
Human Behavior
Some people who consider the tenets of a Resource-Based Economy think that
the system would be difficult due to something called "Human Nature".
The
argument is that humans are inherently competitive, greedy and blindly
self-serving, implying that no matter how technically good things are in
society, there will always be 'corrupt' people who want to abuse others and
seek dominance.
"Human Nature" is defined as:
'the shared psychological attributes of
humankind that are assumed to be shared by all human beings.' 62
Therefore,
the implication of the term is that certain psychological, hence mental
behaviors are in some way "hardwired" into a person. We are thus supposedly
born
with some preset psychological inclinations.
62
wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn
It is easy to see how this kind of assumption manifested, for if you look at
the historical record of the human species thus far, we see an endless
series of wars, genocides, conquests and power abuses. Given that this is
the pattern we recognize
is it easy to assume that it must be "human
nature" or "instinct" to behave in ways that are historically recurring.
Now, so called "criminal behavior" has been a focus in the field of
psychology for a long time. Is it the responsibility of an individual's
genetic makeup that makes them a so-called "criminal", or is it the
environment in which they are raised that determines this? This is the
age-old question of 'Nature vs. Nurture.'
First, what exactly is criminal
behavior? How do we qualify behavioral distinctions that have been invented
by man and change over time? The entire concept of criminality is temporal
and relative to a culture's values and concepts of morality.
Only 600 years
ago, the Aztecs engaged in mass human sacrifice for their gods, often
killing tens of thousands at a time. Was this criminal activity? To us,
perhaps, but to them it was an accepted social custom. What about the
generations and generations of accepted slavery? In modern society it would
be illegal to keep somebody in bondage and force them to work without pay.
Is a criminal someone who steals food in order to feed his starving family?
Most psychologists and behavioral geneticists today try to address this
subjectivity by narrowing down supposed "criminal tendencies" to termed
anti-social, impulsive and aggressive behaviors
as broad and interpretive as
these characterizations might also be. They also catalog and examine
so-called "personality disorders", such as borderline, schizophrenic or
obsessive.
Now, the idea of genetics being the reason for so-called criminal behavior
became popular in the early 19th century. Even Eugenics operations in the
form of sterilization took place in order to "rid society of criminals,
idiots, imbeciles and rapists." 63
63 Joseph, Jay, A critical review of twin and adoption studies of
criminality and antisocial behaviors, The Journal of Mind and Behavior.
However, behavioral geneticists today will
admit that no one has ever found a 'criminal gene'. Rather, their work now
tends to focus on the interaction of Neurochemicals in the brain, along with
observational studies involving family, twins, and adoption.
Beginning with the observational studies, it is now well demonstrated that
the family and 'Reared-Together' Twin Studies (twins that grow up together)
are poor methods of genetic behavioral research. These methods are
confounded by environmental factors, since family members share a common
environment.
However, research of 'Reared-Apart' Twins are seemingly better methods, for
the environments are at least respectfully different from the original
family environments.
Today, the most heavily cited studies in support of a
genetic basis for personality disorders and behavioral tendencies come from
Reared-Apart Twin Studies
While the study of Twins Reared-Apart seems to eliminate the problem of
mutual environmental influence in regard to family patterns, this method is
plagued by the problem of the twins growing up in very similar social,
economic and cultural environments. For instance, one of the most famous
studies on Reared-Apart Twins was one that is often called the "Minnesota
Study".64
Three hundred and forty eight pairs of twins were studied at the
University of Minnesota, with the most noted case from this study, often
cited to defend the genetic basis of behavior, known as the "Jim Twins"
case. Jim Lewis and Jim Springer were separated four weeks after birth in
1940, they grew up 45 miles apart in Ohio, and were reunited in 1979.
The study of these two reunited, identical twins produced the following
concordances:
-
Both twins are married to women named Betty and divorced from women named
Linda
-
One has named his first son James Alan while the other named his
first son James Allan
-
Both twins have an adopted brother whose name is
Larry
-
Both named their pet dog "Toy"
-
Both had some law-enforcement
training and had been part time Deputy Sheriffs in Ohio
-
Each did poorly in
spelling and well in math
-
Each did carpentry, mechanical drawing,
and block lettering 65
First of all, let it be firmly established that both
"Jims" grew up only 45
miles from each other in Ohio.
Considering the close proximity of the twins
and the general cultural disposition of the region, it is safe to assume
that the two men each were subjected to very similar values and traditions.
Culturally, Ohio as a whole has little diversity when compared to other
states. 86% of the state is white 66 while 82% are Christian.67

67
http://www.spiritus-temporis.com/ohio/demographics.html
This is
important because the less diversity a region has, the more uniform the
environmental influences.
Another important element that this author cannot
express due to the lack of available information is the cultural
dispositions and values of the parents involved. If the parents of both
"Jims" were also native to the Ohio region they were brought into, it
further
compounds the propensity of cultural similarity and hence behavioral
similarity.
As far as each being married to women named Betty and divorced from women
named Linda, of the top one thousand most common female names in America,
Linda is #3 and Betty is #14 68.
This is statistically staggering in view of
the number of names in existence, showing a high probability of coincidence.
As far as the names 'James Alan' and 'James Allan', the most common male
name in America
is James! 69 As far as Allan/Alan, more research would need
to be done on the cultural reasoning behind those middle names in the region
of Ohio that they both lived.

In regard to "Both twins have an adopted
brother whose name is Larry", this is a rather odd thing for the Minnesota
researchers to report, for the tradition of naming children typically comes
from the parents, not children.
What this actually reveals has nothing to do
with the 'Jim Twins', but rather shows a powerful cultural similarity of the
parents. If each set of parents both had a propensity to name a son Larry,
then it suggests that the parents were possibly very culturally similar,
hence revealing that the environmental influences on both 'Jims' were also
very similar. Then there are the dogs named "Toy".
Well, while 'Toy' is not
a common dog name, we need to know where the name came from initially.
Someone had to suggest the name to the 'Jims' in order for them to be aware
of the name to begin with.
The reasoning for this name could be multifaceted
and logically derived from the environment. For example, nearly all
domesticated dogs traditionally have toys that their owners provide. The
advent of the name 'Toy' could have come from an association made by a young
Jim hearing his parent reference the toy when playing with the dog. For
example, there have been historical instances where a mother would say to a
young child who is just learning to speak something common like, "Daddy's
home", when announcing the arrival of the father to the child.
The child
would eventually hear these words and associate them with the father walking
into the house. In this common scenario, some children have confused the
father figure with the word "home" rather than "daddy". They would thus
later ask "when is home coming home?". In other words, the word toy could be
a reference name that has been contextually redefined.
In the case of the
Jim twins, we don't have enough information to know if the name "Toy" is
genetic or environmental, but reasoning would naturally lean towards
environmental.
Now, it isn't the point of this document to develop a full argumentative
treatise on the lack of validity of the Twin Studies. The point here is to
express that cultural factors oriented within the society are just as
powerful as familial factors.
The 'Jim Twins' grew up in the same areas and
had similar values and environmental influences. This point must be factored
in and an in-depth analysis needs to be done regarding the cultural causes
involved in such a study. Overall, the Twins Studies, while highly praised,
show extreme weakness in understanding the true causality of a particular
concordance.
However, this doesn't mean genetics don't have a strong influence on our
lives. It is very important to consider the true genetic traits and the
effects they have when intermixed with culture. While most agree that
physical attributes such as eye color, height, and some allergies are
genetic, many do not consider the ramifications these attributes have in
shaping the environment of that person.
For example, suppose you have two
identical twins separated at birth and each has the genetic predisposition
to grow to over 6 feet, each has a high metabolism that keeps him or her
thin, and a neurological wiring that supports acute eye-hand coordination.
Let's say they are both adopted by middle class families in suburban
environments and grow up in what would be considered a traditional American
childhood culture, including sports activities.
Since each brother has
outstanding height and increased coordination genetically, they will have an
advantage in sports. Since basketball and football are the two main sports
in America, they will likely play one or the other at some point. Given
their slender build and tall height, they might gravitate towards
basketball. If they obtain moral support from their friends and family,
perhaps they will each grow up to play professional basketball.
Is this activity of playing basketball genetic? Not in the sense that some
behavioral geneticists would suggest.
The fact is the propensity for playing
basketball is derived from physiological advantages that are genetic, along
with environment based cultural traditions. There is no evidence to suggest
that genes somehow make the basketball player. This is similar to genetic
studies which claim they are looking for the gene which causes smoking or a
makes a person become a Republican
it's rather absurd. The true genetic
basis relevant here is physiological, not behavioral.
Neurochemicals are further examples of physiological influences on behavior.
Serotonin, for example, has been shown to be related to so-called
"antisocial" behavior. Low Serotonin levels can apparently lead to
impulsivity and aggression.70
70 Elliot, FA, A neurological perspective of violent behavior. In DH
Fishbein, The science, treatment, and prevention of antisocial behaviors,
pp. 19-21, 2000, Civic Research Institute
Be that as it may, Neurochemicals do not
instruct a person's behavior in specific ways. Just like other physiological
attributes, they set certain propensities. While there is certainly a
genetic basis to these chemicals, which could relate to familial heredity
and generate so-called 'personality disorders' that result from chemical
imbalances, the Neurochemical behavior assumption does not give any
specifics as to how those chemical propensities will manifest.
In other
words, the behavior that might result from the interaction of these
chemicals can only be extremely generalized. One could say that a person
with a certain imbalance has a propensity to get "angry" more easily than
the standard population. While this is informative, it tells us nothing
about how that behavior will manifest.
It is the environment that determines
the actual behavior or lack thereof it.
There is no scientific evidence that really supports the notion that any of
our behaviors are strictly the result of our genes. Those behaviors that
people often attribute to 'instinct' or 'human nature' can almost always be
tracked to environmental influences. The notion of 'human nature' is largely
mythological. It stems from primitive religious notions that the human being
is either 'good or evil' inherently.
The pursuit of people who seek to find
the "gene" or the like which causes a particular behavior is essentially a
form of superstition. It is like a person being "possessed by demons" which
control their behavior.
The fact is, while Neurochemicals and physiological traits set propensities
for a person's reactions and social gravitation, it is the environment that
really creates our values and behavior. There is no fixed, predetermined 'human nature'. Our values, methods and actions are developed and derived
from our experiences.
As referenced before, the 'Merva-Fowles' Study, done at the University of
Utah in the 1990s, found powerful connections between unemployment and
crime: Their findings found that a 1% rise in unemployment resulted in: a
6.7% increase in homicides; a 3.4 % increase in violent crimes; a 2.4 %
increase in property crime.
Not only that, they also found that those who
were recently unemployed and deprived were especially vulnerable to illness
and disease. Their findings found that a 1% rise in unemployment also
resulted in: a 5.6% increase in death from heart attacks a 3.1% increase in
death from strokes Based on the 1990-1992 unemployment rate, this resulted
in 35,307 more heart attack deaths and 2771 more stroke deaths.
They also
found that those unemployed had a much higher likelihood of high stress,
alcoholism, cigarette smoking, depression and the consumption of less
healthy diets.71
71 Merva & Fowles, Effects of Diminished Economic Opportunities on Social
Stress, Economic Policy Institute, 1992
This study reveals how suffering and aggression can be the results of
environmental depravity, and how powerful the environment is in shaping our
behavior and values. If a person needs to survive, they will do what they
need to do. Does this make them "criminal"? Not necessarily.
The bottom line is that our behavior is based upon what we learn, coupled
with the bio-social pressures that we must deal with in order to survive.
Our genetic makeup does not tell us anything about how to actually function.
It is what we learn and are accustomed to which creates our behavior.
An
insulted man who pulls out a gun and shoots somebody had to learn, at some
point in his life,
what a gun was, how to pull the trigger, along with what he was to find
'insulting' to begin with. Every word on this page is learned by this author
one way or another. Every concept is a collective accumulation of
experience.
There is really nothing that we think which isn't presented to
us in some environmental form. A person born in a particular culture will
absorb the values, traditions and hence behaviors of that culture. A Chinese
baby taken at birth and raised in a British family in England will develop
the language, dialect, mannerisms, traditions and accent of the British
Culture.
Now, returning to our original point regarding people who believe that a
Resource-Based Economy will never work due to the 'despotic attributes of
human nature'; let it be made clear that every person who has ever cheated
another person has had a motivation to do it. This motivation is learned.
Therefore, our goal as a society would be to eliminate the motivations, or
conditions that generate socially offensive behavior. In society today, the
most fundamental condition for offensive behavior is derived from The
Monetary System. As expressed before, The Monetary System perpetuates
corruption, scarcity and insufficiency.
So-called decency cannot exist in a
world of competition, wealth imbalance, poverty and deprivation. The
despotic behavior we see in the world today is not the result of ingrained
genetic forces. It is essentially the result of years of scarcity and
competition oriented conditioning. Hierarchy, greed, competition and
dominance are social manifestations. If you look to the animal kingdom, you
usually see social hierarchy and brutal dominance. Many often say it is an
instinct for these animals to behave this way and that humans share the same
instinctual nature.
While this seems observationally logical, it isn't
taking into account the scarcity that exists in the animal kingdom. If there
isn't enough to go around, the more aggressive animals will rise to the top
generating hierarchy, while the rest compete for resources in a seemingly
greedy fashion.
Professor of Neurology and Neurological Sciences at Stanford University,
Robert Sapolsky, spent 30 years personally studying a Baboon troop in East
Africa. This troop exhibited the same social hierarchy, competition and
dominance patterns as human beings do today. However, something interesting
happened about 10 years into the study.
The troop was exposed accidentally
to a disease that killed off the Alpha male baboons, leaving only the
subordinate male baboons along with the females. This event dramatically
altered the social nature of the troop. None of the remaining baboons filled
the newly open positions of dominance. The hierarchy virtually stopped and
aggressive behavior subsided tremendously.
This is still the case with this
troop 20 years later. Even when new, adolescent males would come join the
troop, it took about 6 months for the behavior of that new baboon to adjust
from the typically competitive patterns to the troop's new balanced and
non-aggressive behaviors.72
72 Interview with R. Sapolsky, Stress, National Geographic, 2008
While this observation leaves many questions, it goes to show how behavior
changes based on how the environment changes. To think that our human
society is locked into some prison of 'instinct' and 'human nature' is not
viable. Even if we have 'predispositions' to certain survival patterns, it
is still the environment that generates the actual behavior.
In the words of Epidemiology professor Sir Michael Marmot in reference to
the Baboon Study:
"I would say that what we have learned
from the study of
the nonhuman primates is that the conditions in which people live
are
absolutely vital to their health. I think what we are trying to create is a
better society
how can we create a society that has the conditions which
will allow people to flourish, and that's where this is heading- to create a
better society that promotes human flourishing." 73
Dr. Sapolsky adds:
"One of the things the baboons teach us is that if they
are able to, in one generation, transform what are supposed to be textbook
social systems, 'engraved in stone'
we don't have an excuse when we say
there are certain inevitabilities of human social systems." 74

74
Interview with R. Sapolsky, Stress, National Geographic, 2008
In a Resource-Based Economy, the goals are equality, liberty and abundance.
If these environmental factors can be created for humanity, our social
system will evolve out of the degenerative, corrupt and self interest
oriented patterns we see today.
The Legal System
When it comes to human behavior, society today attempts to control itself by
way of threat, using Laws. Laws are there to control people. They are
'patches' which do not address the root causes of behavior. If a person is
arrested for stealing, very little thought is given as to why that person
chooses to steal to begin with.
Rather than consider the root causes,
society takes the easy way out and often removes the "criminal" via prisons.
As of 2007, over 9 million people are in prisons throughout the world, with
the United States leading the way with the highest prison population of any
other country.75 This is just sad.
75 Walmsley,
Roy, World Prison Population 2007, International Center for Prison Studies,
London
The source of any so-called crime is really society itself. There is no such
thing as a "criminal". As repeatedly expressed, the Monetary System
generates corruption by its very construct. As the Merva & Fowles study
presented previously clearly shows, socially offensive behavior is directly
related to socioeconomic circumstances.
The great majority of people in
prisons come from deprived socioeconomic positions.
Laws are band-aids. Instead of depending on a failed system of punishment or
incarceration after the damage is done, we need to address the inadequacies
of society which lead to socially offensive behavior, such as poverty,
malnutrition, homelessness, depravity, social distortion, failed education,
financial stress, neglected child care, and the like.
Therefore, if we want
to alter the behavior of people, we have to alter the social conditions. We
want to 'design out' the flaws. We design out the need for paper
proclamations and laws. Laws are byproducts of insufficiency.
You don't put
up a sign that says:
'Speed Limit 55 miles per hour' for safety.
You design
the system technically so safety is built in and human error is not an
option.
If you don't want a person to steal, you make what they need readily
available to them without the need for subservience or competition.
With the progress of technology today, we have the ability to create a new
social system that can allow all humans access to all the necessities of
life, without a price tag, debt or servitude. This will have a profound
effect on the way people treat each other and interact in society. A
staggering drop in crime would be the result, for most crimes are monetary
related.
This isn't to say that overnight all other forms of socially
offensive behavior will disappear. Jealousy and other forms of confidence
issues will still generate problems. However, the treatment of those who
commit socially offensive acts in the future will be dramatically more
humane and proactive. If a serial killer is found and brought in, he or she
would not be treated as a criminal, but rather as a sick patient.
Society
will understand that people are products of their environment and rather
than condemn the person to a cold concrete cell, social scientists will
heavily research the cultural causes that generated the serial killer's
behavior, and consider those conditions that need to be altered.
Summary of Chapter 7
Human behavior is a product of the environment. Genetic components, which
manifest in physiological traits, serve only to create propensities for
certain reactions.
Therefore, since it is the environment that influences
our behavior itself, if we find patterns of behavior in our society that are
socially offensive and abusive, we should look to the environment to figure
out why those behaviors manifest to begin with. The legal system today is a
massive social distortion that does not take into account the environmental
influences of a supposed "criminal".
In a Resource-Based Economy, where
scarcity and deprivation are deliberately reduced through modern
technological methods, the behavior of society will change dramatically for
the better.
Chapter 8: Functional Spirituality
People want answers, so through time we have invented explanations for
phenomena. As our societies have grown, our tools for analyzing the world
and its attributes have improved and thus our understandings have changed
based on newer discoveries.
Knowledge is an evolutionary phenomenon just
like everything else in nature. Therefore, it is critical that we all be
mentally and emotionally prepared for our traditional beliefs to lose
relevance. For some, this is a very difficult process due to the emotional
attachments that have been created around certain beliefs. Religion is a
powerful example of this ideological attachment.
Establishment Religion, in
many ways, seems to be rooted in a perceptual misunderstanding about life's
processes.
For instance, it presents a worldview that often puts the human
on a different level than other elements of nature. This 'spiritual ego' has
led to dramatic conflicts for generations, not only between human beings,
but inadvertently between us and the environment itself. However, as time
has moved forward, Science has shown how human beings are subject to the
exact same forces of nature as everything else.
We have learned that we all
share the same atomic substructure as trees, birds and all other forms of
life. We have learned that we cannot live without nature's elements... we
need clean air to breathe, food to eat, energy from the sun, etc. When we
understand this symbiotic relationship of life, we begin to see that as far
as 'relationships' are concerned, our relationship to the planet and nature
is the most profound and important.
The medium by which this is expressed,
is Science, for The Scientific Method has allowed us insight into these
natural processes, so we can better understand how we 'fit' into this life
system as a whole.
The Religious Ideal
Nearly all religions of the world talk about certain ideal values for
humanity.
-
Christianity: "Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you."
-
Buddhism:
"Putting oneself in the place of another, one should not kill nor
cause another to kill."
-
Confucianism: "Never impose on others
what you would not choose for yourself."
-
Hinduism: "One should never do that to another which
one regards as injurious to one's own self."
-
Islam: "Hurt no one so that no one may
hurt you."
-
Judaism: "The stranger who resides with
you shall be to you as one of your citizens; you shall love him as
yourself."
-
Taoism: "Regard your neighbor's gain as
your own gain, and your neighbor's loss as your own loss."
Regardless of these notions, one glance at society today makes one wonder
why the ideal of universally valuing and respecting your fellow human being
has never taken root.
It was the Jesus character who said:
"Love thy
neighbor as thy self".
But how? How can we have a society where people live
together in harmony, working for the common good, as the religious ideals
promote?
The answer is that it is up to us to design a system that allows for those
humane ideals to flourish.
Today's self interested, money oriented society creates an environment that
refuses to allow for the universal caring of another. This system is based
on the perpetuation of oneself, at the expense of others, and therefore it
can never allow for a world of balance and harmony.
The fact is, it is time to stop praying, stop wishing and stop blindly
talking about our supposed humanistic and religious ideals and actually work
to make them happen!
Talk is Cheap
A Resource-Based Economy puts into practice everything the great religious
and philosophic teachers have always talked about since time began in regard
to humans embracing each other as their own, and working together in mutual
respect and harmony. The use of science and The Scientific Method, while
often deemed cold and heartless, actually presents one of the most profound
spiritual unfoldings we have ever known.
Unlike those who endlessly talk
about peace, love and harmony among the peoples of the earth, science can
actually work to make it happen. There is nothing more caring than The
Scientific Method, for the results have proven to be cataclysmically
beneficial to the whole of humanity.
While many people look upon Mother
Teresa's selfless nature with great awe and respect, few tend to see
Alexander Fleming, the man who discovered Penicillin, in the same
romanticized way. Penicillin has saved countless more lives today than any
charitable idea or organization.
The point is that science and technology
are divinity in action.
Summary of Chapter 8
It is time we stop pontificating and providing lip service to those
spiritual values which religious and secular philosophers have been
discussing for millennia and finally put them into practice.
While there are
endless scientific and superstitious opinions about who we are and where we
have come from, the most important issue at hand exists in the here and now.
In view of the terrible suffering and questionable future of the human race,
worrying about if god created the universe
or if we were created by
extraterrestrials
or even if we are a product of evolution and celestial
matter, is meaningless.
Big Bang or no Big Bang it doesn't change the
problems we have now. We cannot wait for some divine revelation or some
"great man" to guide us. We must realize that we are on our own on this
planet and it is up to us to change the world for the better.
Science is the
tool for this functional spirituality and if we work to apply its method for
the betterment of civilization itself, we can reach the spiritual goals we
have sought since antiquity.
Part 5
Taking Action
Chapter 9: The Movement
The Zeitgeist Movement is not a political movement. It does not recognize
nations, governments, races, religions, creeds or class. Our understandings
conclude that these are now false, outdated distinctions that are far from
positive factors for true collective human growth and potential. Their basis
is in power division and stratification, not unity and equality, which is
our goal.
While it is important to understand that everything in life is a
natural progression, we must also acknowledge the reality that the human
species has the ability to drastically slow and paralyze progress, through
social structures which are out of date, dogmatic, and hence out of line
with nature itself. The world you see today, full of war, corruption,
elitism, pollution, poverty, epidemic disease, human rights abuses,
inequality and crime is the result of this paralysis.
This movement is about awareness, in avocation of a fluid, evolutionary
progression, combining the personal, social, technological and spiritual. It
recognizes that the human species is on a natural path for unification,
derived from a communal acknowledgment of fundamental and near empirical
understandings of how nature works and how we as humans fit into/are a part
of this universal unfolding we call life.
While this path does exist, it is
unfortunately hindered or not recognized by the great majority of humans,
who continue to perpetuate outdated and hence degenerative modes of conduct
and association. It is this intellectual irrelevancy that the Movement hopes
to overcome through education and social action.
The goal is to revise our world society in accord with present day knowledge
on all levels, not only creating awareness of social and technological
possibilities many have been conditioned to think "impossible" or against
"human nature", but also to provide a means of overcoming those elements in
society which perpetuate these outdated systems.
Bridging the Differences
In order to do so, we first have to establish a perspective in reference to
the world today. As of now, the technology that can free humans from
meaningless tasks is stifled due to the monetary based labor system. This is
unacceptable.
The fact that technology is not being allowed to flourish for
the benefit of human kind is, in fact, a Civil Rights issue on a certain
level. It is time we forget about our differences and come together for the
collective benefit of our species. We all need food, air, water and the
like, and we all want liberty and happiness. The only way this is going to
be accomplished is if we all work together to overcome a now-obsolete social
system.
Of course, this is easier said than done, as humans who have
undergone tremendous social distortion currently run our world. Their often
elitist values are constantly reinforced by the material benefits their
business and political corruptions obtain. We should feel pity for their
ignorance, however.
In the words of Ghandi:
"Do not hate your oppressors.
They need to be liberated just as you do".
The fact is, traditional political activism is not the path. The
establishment has gotten far too good at controlling traditionally oriented
dissent. Rather, the path of this movement is to first create grassroots
awareness on a global scale.
This comes down to communication. Those of us
who believe in this direction must work to spread awareness of its ideas.
Humanity must first be aware of this social direction before any kind of
action can be taken. As of now, thezeitgeistmovement.com is being developed
into 30+ languages.
We will be creating country, state and regional
organizations in the hopes of eventually having a Movement organization in
every area of the globe. This kind of communications project will have
difficult barriers from various ideological groups. It very important that
we bridge the differences between cultures by expressing how, at the core,
we are really all the same.
Our similarity and needs greatly over-shadow our
religious and political differences. Apart from spreading awareness, our
focus should also be on continually exposing the monetary frauds and social
corruptions that are endlessly churned out in our society. We want to make
the governments and peoples of the world feel embarrassed by the sickness
their systems generate, while also making the population understand the root
causes of the corruption and how to move away from it with the intelligent
application of science and technology for social and environmental concern.
As expressed, the monetary systems of the world are all failing at this
time. The result of this could be catastrophic. It is critical that we
absorb those who are being hurt by this monetary failure and give them
direction. Once a very large number of people on the planet join hands in
common pursuit of a dramatic social shift, we will begin the next phase,
which will put pressure on
all nations simultaneously to begin moving out of the monetary structure.
Until then, communication, coupled with peaceful social rebellion is key. As
a general rule, all social facets that perpetuate the profit system, war and
human abuse should be banned. No one should ever join any military in any
nation or work for the war industry. In turn, the political system needs to
be exposed for what it is.
The governments of the world today are run by
businessmen, lawyers and military men
likely three of the most useless
specializations we have. When we understand that our problems on this planet
are technical, we then see that if any group of people were to be considered
as qualified to make decisions about anything, they would naturally be
technically and thus objectively focused
not politically motivated.
Politics is a monetary creation.
Tips for spreading awareness:
-
Post thevenusproject.com and
thezeitgeistmovement.com online wherever you can
-
Create YouTube videos
promoting both the Movement and the idea of a Resource-Based Economy
-
Call
into radio shows and bring up the Movement whenever possible
-
Download
Zeitgeist Addendum and screen it in your community; get it on public
access/networks
-
Copy this booklet and distribute it via hard copy or Cd-Rom
-
Download the Orientation Presentation Slideshow and Slideshow Movie and
hold your own events
-
Saturate the Internet as much as possible
-
Be aware
that March 15th of each year is "Zeitgeist Day" and hold an event in your
area
-
Work to specifically inform those who are suffering due to the
pending economic collapse
-
Continually expose the corruption of our current
system, publicly
-
Contact existing "activism" groups, such as the ACLU and
Greenpeace, and try to explain to them how their efforts, while very noble,
are not going to solve any of the major social problems, for they are not
addressing root causes.
Interdisciplinary Teams
The backbone of the initial development of this new social system will come
from teams of researchers and technicians working in all relevant fields.
These can be called Interdisciplinary Teams.
The first team we are putting together is the "Communications Team".
Everything listed above would constitute some action of this team. Anyone
who supports this direction should help to inform others. We are all a part
of the Communications Team on a certain level. In turn, more teams will be
created that will work in specific areas related to the implementation of a
Resource-Based Economy. There are many scientific fields that are needed to
solidify the underlying mechanisms of the project. These Interdisciplinary
Teams would include research into computer programming, city planning,
robotics, education, data collection, etc.
Please check back to www.thezeitgeistmovement.com for organizational announcements in this
regard. If you feel you have a skill that would contribute to this
development, please let us know when we begin to setup the teams. A whole
section of the website will be devoted to this interaction and focus. As we
grow, full conferences will emerge.
In time, we will eventually be able to
begin the first city, even if it is only a prototype of sorts.
Final Thoughts
There are many out there who would say that what we are describing here,
that is the development of a Resource-Based Global Economy, would never
happen. They would typically cite "human nature", the "power elite" or
erroneous technical opinions in their defense. This cynicism has no support
in view of humanity's technical and social development throughout history.
We have come from a world of extreme superstition, abject slavery and
extreme racism and social prejudice, to a slowly emerging world of race
equality, scientific ingenuity and emerging values that desire to see
humanity benefit as a whole.
In the words of
Carl Sagan:
"The old appeals to racial, sexual and
religious chauvinism, to rabid nationalist fervor, are beginning not to
work. A new consciousness is developing which sees the earth as a single
organism, and recognizes that an organism at war with itself, is doomed.
We are one planet." 76

We have gone from smoke signals to the telephone to electronic mail sent at
near the speed of light. Everything that has once been considered impossible
has gradually become possible. The Wright Brothers were told by "experts"
that it was impossible to fly
years ago people who talked of traveling to
the moon were dismissed and labeled as "Mooniacs".
To assume something is
'impossible' in this world is a failure of creativity.
If 120,000 people can come together to build a nuclear bomb, as was done
with the Manhattan Project in the late 1930s, there is no reason why we
cannot come together and use human ingenuity to accomplish incredible social
achievements for the betterment of humanity.
It is time we unleash our
'Weapons of Mass Creation' (WMCs) unto the world.
It is time we take
responsibility for each other and ourselves. We have the knowledge, means
and initiative to devise an entirely new social architecture that can create
a world we actually enjoy and flourish in.
Very simply, it is time to grow up.
