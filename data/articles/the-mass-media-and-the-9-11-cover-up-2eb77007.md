The government and controlled media have lied to the public about 9-11 since
the day it occurred.
Those who have discerned and exposed the lies about the
"false flag" terror attacks and the fraudulent "War on Terror" have been
treated like madmen and criminals.
It's time for this criminal nightmare to
end.
-
Who controls the "hidden hand" in the U.S. mass media that censors and
suppresses the crucial 9-11 evidence?
-
What is the nexus connecting the
architects of 9-11 with the mass media moguls who are covering up the truth?
Rupert Murdoch, a Jew,
is a supporter of Zionism and
a friend of Israeli president Shimon Peres.
The on-going cover-up of the evidence of Israeli
involvement in 9-11 and explosions in the World Trade Center by the U.S.
mass media is indicative of a high-level connection between the architects
of the "false flag" terror attacks and the media moguls who control the
major news networks in the United States.
As a longtime observer of Israel and the Middle East, I have watched how the
U.S. mass media has increasingly become an instrument of Israeli propaganda.
As Zionists have extended their grip on American media networks the major
television, radio, film and print media outlets have effectively become
propaganda tools of a foreign state - Israel - and are used to manipulate
U.S. public opinion to support the Zionist agenda. The painfully obvious
anti-Arab and anti-Islamic bias of Hollywood films and news-related programs
has become ever more extreme as pro-Israel Zionists have achieved near total
control of the U.S. mass media.
It needs to be understood that the Zionist conquest of the U.S. mass media
did not simply happen by chance or as a result of natural market forces. It
is the planned result of a long-term covert strategy put into effect decades
ago by the government of Israel to control the news and entertainment
networks that inform how Americans view Zionism, Israel, and the Middle
East.
The Israelis realized that if they could control what Americans read,
see, and hear about Zionism, Israel, and the Middle East then they would be
able to control how they think.
Controlling U.S. public opinion is crucial to
realizing the Zionist agenda.
Rupert Murdoch's media empire
acts as a Zionist propaganda network.
Zionist control of the major media networks has
resulted in Americans getting an extremely distorted and biased view of the
world, particularly of the Middle East and of such significant
events as
9-11 and the "War on Terror."
Understanding the strategy and the people
behind Israel's conquest of the American mass media is an essential step to
recovering our national sovereignty.
As an independent journalist and researcher of 9-11, I have seen how
Zionist-controlled media outlets are actively engaged in covering up the
evidence of Israeli involvement in the "false flag" attacks of 9-11 and the
Zionist-planned "War on Terror." I have personally been subjected to years
of slander and defamation from a host of Zionist-controlled news outlets,
including CNN and FOX News, simply because I have investigated and written
about the evidence of Israeli involvement.
Today, the United States of America is by all appearances an
Israeli-occupied state. The U.S. Congress dutifully authorizes the annual
payment of an immense tribute to Israel, some three thousand million dollars
a year. Like a subservient colony, the United States provides hundreds of
thousands of its young men and women to fight and die as mercenaries in
Zionist-planned wars in the Middle East.
The tens of thousands of American
and European christian soldiers and mercenaries fighting in Iraq and
Afghanistan are very similar to the former Mamluks of Baghdad - captured
"male white slaves" serving their Zionist rulers.
This dismal situation is, of course, not new. It has only become more
obvious and extreme. The United States has provided more than $108 billion
in direct aid to the state of Israel since 1949 (Washington Report, July
2006) and the U.S. State Dept. recently promised the Israeli military
another $30 billion over the next ten years - a twenty-five percent
increase.
Hundreds, if not thousands, of U.S. soldiers have died as a result of
serving on or near the front lines in Israel's wars. The 241 American
marines killed in the Beirut bombing of 1983 and the 34 servicemen killed
during the 1967 Israeli attack on the USS Liberty are the first that come to
mind.
More than 4,000 American men and women have died during the current phase,
the occupation stage, of the nearly two-decade-long war against Iraq.
The
U.S.-led invasion and occupation of Iraq, an illegal war of aggression, is
clearly a Zionist-planned war in which Americans and other mercenaries
actually do the fighting - and dying.
WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE?
The obvious question is, where is the outrage?
Where is the spiritual,
intellectual, and political resistance to this blatant exploitation of
Americans and their national resources by a tiny foreign state with a
militant and racist ideology? Why do patriotic Americans tolerate this abuse
of the "land of the free and the home of the brave?"
While the power of the Israeli lobby (and an occasional murder) may explain
the lack of any significant political resistance in the U.S. Congress to
Zionist demands, it can not explain how the American population has come to
accept this extremely bizarre and abusive relationship with a foreign state.
How has Zionist control of the United States been foisted onto the American
people?
ZIONIST DECEPTIONS
Many Americans willingly accept the extremely one-sided and abusive
relationship with Israel because they have internalized three fundamental
Zionist deceptions, which have been forced into their brains by the
controlled mass media.
-
The first is the religious hoax that equates the modern state of Israel with
the Israel of the Bible. This religious fraud elevates modern-day Israelis,
regardless of their actual ethnicity, to being the rightful heirs of the
Promised Land. Although this hoax is quickly revealed to anyone who actually
reads Zionist history, it has been successfully foisted onto millions of
extremely naive and gullible Christians. These misled and abused people are
often referred to as christian Zionists.
-
The second fundamental Zionist deception is that Israel is a "sister
democracy" of the United States and that Israelis and Americans share the
same "democratic" values. This lie is also quickly exposed by reading
Israeli history or visiting Israeli-occupied Palestine. The only Americans
who could possibly share Israeli values are those who believe in Jewish
racism and supremacism - the central pillar of the Zionist worldview that
is completely un-American.
-
The third Zionist deception is that nineteen Arab Muslims under the
leadership of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Osama bin Laden were behind the
9-11 attacks at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
This deception has
been used to usher in the Zionist-planned "War on Terror," which has brought
U.S. and European troops into an extensive long-term Middle Eastern war.
-
Why hasn't the media interviewed the families of the nineteen suspected
hijackers?
-
Why does the media not demand an open trial for Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed, the alleged "mastermind" of 9-11, currently held by the U.S. in
Guantanamo?
-
Why is the media treatment of these people only as deep as their
photos?
While the first two deceptions are primarily philosophical in nature and
rather pointless to argue, the 9-11 deception is painfully real and
something we allow to continue at our own peril.
"AUSCHWITZ OF THE
MIND"
These Zionist deceptions, which are all demonstrably false, have been
carefully planted and cultivated in the minds of millions of people through
the devices of the Zionist-controlled media.
Zionist domination of the mass
media and academia in the United States is so pervasive that Americans are
subjected, like Truman Burbank in the film The Truman Show, to a constant
barrage of multi-level deception, as if the entire population were living in
a false construction - an "Auschwitz of the mind."
Like the false world of Truman Burbank, the Zionist-created worldview is so
overwhelming that it prevents many people from ever realizing that they are
being held mentally captive. Even when we peel away the layers of deception
and expose the fraud, somehow the show goes on. For the criminals in high
places, the show must go on.
The first deception, the religious hoax of the Zionist state's connection to
the biblical Israel, is doctrine to television evangelists like Pat
Robertson and his Christian Coalition, while the second and third have
become "conventional wisdom" for the U.S. news and entertainment media.
Because millions of Americans have accepted and internalized these
Zionist-created falsehoods, they are unable to understand the actual
realities of the
Middle East or the massive fraud of the "War on Terror."
The controlled media is careful to censor any information that might disturb
the perverse worldview of America's forty million Christian Zionists who are
kept in the darkness like children locked in a closet.
ZIONISM - "THE REAL
ENEMY OF THE JEWS"
When, for example, the highly-regarded Israeli historian Avi Shlaim wrote
his 2005 editorial entitled "Is Zionism today the real enemy of the Jews?"
(below insert) his comments were published in the International Herald Tribune (IHT), which
is read in 180 nations, but kept out of the pages of The New York Times, the
domestic newspaper of its parent company.
Now, why would the New York Times, whose motto is "All The News That's Fit
to Print," censor the viewpoint of a renowned Israeli historian writing on
the causes of modern anti-Semitism?
What did Shlaim say that the editors at
the Times thought was unfit for Americans to read?
"Israel's image today is negative not because it is a Jewish state but
because it habitually transgresses the norms of acceptable international
behavior. Indeed, Israel is increasingly perceived as a rogue state, as an
international pariah, and as a threat to world peace," Shlaim, an Iraqi Jew
who was born in Baghdad, wrote.
"This perception of Israel is a major factor
in the recent resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe and in the rest of the
world. In this sense, Zionism today is the real enemy of the Jews."
When one understands that the primary function of the Zionist-controlled
media is to keep Americans in the dark about the Middle East and Zionism, it
becomes clear why Shlaim's article was published in the international
publication owned by the New York Times but kept from their U.S. readership.
Shlaim's comments would have greatly disturbed the carefully cultivated
Zionist worldview of millions of Americans - both Jews and Gentiles - an
audience that is both protected and held captive.
THE MEDIA
COVER-UP OF 9-11
As an independent journalist I have seen how many important stories have
been covered-up or ignored by the controlled media.
I have written about
many of these suppressed stories, such as the sinking of the Estonia, the
downing of Flight TWA 800, and the
dangers of depleted uranium.
At the top
of my list, however, is the most egregious and criminal cover-up of the
evidence of 9-11.
"Ninety-five percent of the work of the intelligence agencies around the
world is deception and disinformation," German intelligence expert Andreas
von Bülow told me in December 2001.
This deception is widely propagated in
the mainstream media creating an accepted version of events.
"Journalists
don't even raise the simplest questions," he said. "Those who differ are
labeled as crazy."
After the London press conference during Jimmy Walter's
2005 European 9-11
Truth tour, two reporters from the BBC were eager to interview me.
"Why are you the only journalist who does
not believe the official explanation of what happened on 9-11?" was
their first question.
The BBC interviewing the
author in London
"If that is the case," I told them, "it is
probably due to the fact that others who have questioned the official
version have lost their jobs as a result."
The van was leaving for the hotel so I decided
to cut the interview short. I could see where the interview was heading.
When FOX News and CNN interviewed me on the pretense that they were
interested in my 9-11 research and evidence, all they really wanted to do
was to smear me as an anti-Semite.
In both cases the interviewers were clearly not
at all interested in the 9-11 evidence or my research.
Alan Samuel Colmes, a Jewish
talking head for Fox News,
was not interested in
discussing the evidence of 9-11
but only in trying to smear
the author as an anti-Semite.
"WOE BETIDE HIM..."
"The dissident cannot be taken seriously,"
the veteran British journalist Roland Huntford wrote about the mass
media in his book The New Totalitarians. "There is a range of tolerated
opinions, and a narrow one it is: woe betide him who departs from it."
While Huntford was writing about the controlled
media of Sweden in the 1970s, his comments hold true for the
Zionist-controlled mass media in the United States today, particularly when
the subject is 9-11 or Israel.
I, for example, have paid a very high price for investigating and writing
about the evidence that contradicts the government's version of what
happened on 9-11. The first attack came from the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith (ADL) in November 2001.
The ADL, a private organization
dedicated to supporting Zionist and Israeli interests, first smeared the
American Free Press, the newspaper I wrote for, as a,
"conspiratorial and
anti-Semitic weekly newspaper," which it said had "repeatedly turned to the
subject of the 9-11 attacks as grist for its mill."
The ADL then singled me out for my article, "Some Survivors Say Bombs
Exploded Inside WTC" in which, the ADL said,
"Bollyn suggests that the
'mainstream media' is ignoring eyewitness accounts of bombs that exploded
inside the World Trade Center before the collapse of the TwinTowers."
Indeed, the first line of my article from September 2001 said exactly that:
Despite reports from numerous eyewitnesses and experts, including news
reporters on the scene, who heard or saw explosions immediately before the
collapse of the World Trade Center, there has been virtual silence in the
mainstream media.
But, I asked,
-
Why would an organization dedicated to Israeli and Jewish
interests attack me, as a journalist, for writing about eyewitness reports
of explosions in the World Trade Center?
-
What did my writing about this
extremely newsworthy subject have to do with Israel or Jews?
Had my BBC interview gone on, I might have asked why the BBC editors had
ignored and censored the comments of their own reporter, Steve Evans, who
had been in the SouthTower (WTC 2) when it was hit and who reported having
observed a "series of explosions." Shortly after the destruction of the WTC,
the BBC interviewed Evans on their television news program based in London.
Because Evans' observations were ignored by the BBC and not followed up, I
wrote about his report of the explosions he felt in the SouthTower:
Evans was asked what he had seen:
"Its more what I felt really," Evans said.
"I was at the base of the 2nd tower, the second tower that was hit. There
was an explosion I didnt think it was an explosion - but the base of the
building shook. I felt it shake
then when we were outside, the second
explosion happened and then there was a series of explosions
"
[At this
point the London news anchor cut Evans off in mid-sentence rather than
listen to Evans continue to describe the "series of explosions" that he saw
and felt. Evans' microphone was turned down.]
But in a minute Evans returns
to the "series of explosions" that he witnessed:
"We can only wonder at the
kind of damage the kind of human damage which was caused by those
explosions those series of explosions," Evans said.
Evans is a professional journalist and his observations of explosions in the
second tower need to be taken into account by anybody looking into the cause
of the catastrophe of September 11.
Many eyewitnesses reported similar
explosions, but these reports, and what they suggest, are intentionally
being censored and avoided by the very people who are supposed to be
investigating the cause of the collapses. The same kind of censorship
occurred with FOX News, CNN, and the leading U.S. news networks that had
reporters at the World Trade Center.
Firsthand reports of explosions at the
WTC from professional reporters were broadcast only once - and never picked
up again, except by the much-despised "conspiracy theorists."
The news reports that five Middle Eastern men were being sought or had been
captured in New Jersey after they had videotaped themselves celebrating in
front of the burning towers were treated in the same way.
The
arrest of the
five men, all Israelis, two of whom were known Mossad agents, was only
reported in the Bergen Record (New Jersey) on September 12, 2001 - but
never discussed or investigated by the national news networks.
ISRAELIS FOREWARNED
Likewise, the story of the Odigo text message warning of the attacks -
before they occurred - was dropped into the media's memory hole. The instant
text messages, which were precise to the minute, had been sent via the
Israeli-owned Odigo instant messaging service and had even been received by
Odigo employees in Israel, but the story of Israelis having prior knowledge
of the attacks was never discussed in the U.S. mass media.
How did the news editors at the BBC, FOX News, CNN, and the leading networks
decide to censor their own reporters and avoid discussing certain aspects of
9-11?
Let's look at this logically.
The 9-11 event was the biggest story these
news editors had ever handled. Suffice it to say that the editorial
decisions about how to cover 9-11 must have been made by the boss at the
top.
Any decision to omit or censor reports about explosions at the World
Trade Center or indications of Israeli involvement would have been made by
the senior executive of each network. In the case of CNN it would have been
Gerald M. Levin, the CEO of Time Warner, who acquired Turner Broadcasting in
1997. (Levin unexpectedly announced his resignation in December 2001, less
than three months after 9-11.)
At FOX News the top decision maker would have been Rupert Murdoch,
CEO of
News Corporation. At ABC News it would have been Michael D. Eisner,
CEO of
Disney, the network's parent company.
-
Were the media moguls Murdoch, Levin,
and Eisner involved in 9-11?
-
How else could they know that certain aspects
of the event needed to be suppressed by their news networks?
Their networks
have been suppressing important information about 9-11 since the day of the
event.
They have also been actively involved in a conspiracy to cover-up the
truth.
-
How can that be?
-
Who is behind this cover-up?
-
What occult power, what
hidden hand, would be able to communicate with these men and influence them
to suppress important reports and evidence from the terror attacks of 9-11?
ARNON MILCHAN -
MOSSAD'S MAN IN THE MIDDLE
If one considers the known evidence of Israeli prior knowledge of 9-11, the Odigo text messages and the five arrested Mossad agents, for example, as
indicative of Israeli state involvement in the crime, the identity of the
occult power behind the cover-up is rather obvious.
The "hidden hand"
suppressing the information about 9-11 would have to be a high-level person
in the Israeli political-military intelligence establishment who also has
very close relations with media kingpins like Murdoch, Levin, and Eisner.
Arnon Milchan (a.k.a. Milchen) is such a person.
While millions of Americans have watched his films, such as Pretty Woman and
JFK, very few know that Arnon Milchan is a "best friend" of
Shimon Peres
(born Szymon Perski in Wiszniewo, Poland) the current Israeli president and
godfather of Israel's nuclear arsenal.
The Israeli movie producer
Arnon Milchan (between Peres and Netanyahu) is a close friend of
Israel's president Shimon
Peres ("his first letter he wrote as president went to me"),
Defense Minister Ehud Barak,
and Likud Party leader Binyamin ("Bibi") Netanyahu.
Milchan, who began his career
with the fertilizer/chemical company Milchan Brothers,
reportedly owns 30 companies
in 17 countries involved in plastics, electronics, communications, and
pharmaceuticals.
Milchan's 40-year friendship with Peres, the man
who oversaw the illegal development of Israel's nuclear weapon program is
key to understanding Milchan's career as an undercover operative, weapons
procurer, and film producer.
The fact that Milchan, the Hollywood producer,
has been Israel's "foremost weapons procurer" for decades, brokering deals
for "everything from nuclear triggers to rocket fuel to guidance systems,"
is seldom mentioned in the U.S. news media.
This is probably due to the fact that Milchan is also a "best friend" and
business partner of Rupert Murdoch. He is also a friend a business partner
with Levin (Warner Brothers) and Eisner.
"I consider him one of my best
friends," Milchan said about Murdoch, "and I think vice versa. We're having
a ball. He's a very cool guy."
"Kingpins like Warner Brothers' Gerald Levin and Disney's Michael Eisner are
quick to return his calls," the American Jewish journalist Ann Louise
Bardach wrote about Milchan in her article 'The Last Tycoon' in April 2000.
In 1997, after a six-year relationship with Warner Brothers, Milchan became
a partner with Murdoch, selling him twenty percent of his film company, New
Regency Productions, for $200 million. Murdoch also invested another $30
million in Regency Television.
Today, Murdoch's equity partnership with Milchan
is close to fifty percent.
"Milchan's deal with Fox also assures him a
level of financial security," Bardach wrote. "With Murdoch's $200
million investment and a subsequent $600 million line of credit from a
team of banks led by Chase Manhattan, Milchan is well into mogul
territory.
"Milchan's tony offices occupy most of
Building 12, right next door to the Executive Building on the Fox lot,"
Bardach wrote. "And it is from this seat of power that Milchan is
building an entertainment empire that could one day rival Murdoch's."
Peter Chernin, president and
chief operating officer of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, left,
presents Arnon Milchan with a
lifetime achievement award at an event celebrating
the 60th Anniversary of the
state of Israel in Los Angeles on September 18, 2008.
Chernin, Murdoch, and Milchan
have worked together for many years.
THE MILCHAN INFLUENCE
The Israeli influence in films and news media has profoundly affected the
quality of news reporting and entertainment.
Israeli attitudes and ideas are
now disseminated through national media outlets which reach the entire U.S.
population on a daily basis. Israeli-made films often reveal hints or clues
about actual crimes or criminal plots the Israeli producers are aware of.
One such project, The Lone Gunmen, produced by Milchan's "best friend"
Rupert Murdoch, had an uncanny resemblance to the 9-11 attacks on the World
Trade Center. Was this Milchan's influence? The Milchan-Murdoch partnership
in television production may be key to understanding the genesis of the plot
of the pilot episode of this short-lived television series. In the first
episode a passenger airliner is hijacked by remote control and flown toward
the World Trade Center.
Disaster is averted at the last minute by
over-riding the computer program that has hijacked the plane.
The Lone Gunmen, produced by Rupert
Murdoch in 2000, revealed an extremely uncanny prescience of 9-11(click
above image).
During
the same year it was made, Milchan was producing two television series in
collaboration with Fox Television: Roswell, which aired on Warner Brothers
network, and Malcolm in the Middle, which was aired on Fox. The Lone Gunmen
pilot episode aired on FOX Television in March 2001.
Given the long, close, and extensive collaboration between Murdoch and
Milchan, it seems fair to ask:
-
Was Arnon Milchan the original source of
the plotline for The Lone Gunmen?
-
Why were the people involved in the
production of this episode not investigated by the media?
-
Why did the media ignore its own uncanny
prescience, The Lone Gunmen episode, which mirrored reality six
months later?
-
Was the similarity between the
Murdoch-produced show and reality too close for comfort?
-
Was it too uncomfortable to discuss the
origin of the idea for the show?
Apparently so.
Was the Israeli chemical
magnate Arnon Milchan the author of
the plotline for The Lone
Gunmen pilot episode in which a passenger airplane
was remotely hijacked and
flown into the World Trade Center?
In Milchan's highly-controversial film JFK
(1991), directed by Oliver Stone, the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy is ascribed to conspirators within the U.S. military-industrial
complex.
Whose idea was this? Why is Arnon Milchan's own connection with
Itzhak Rabin, who was in Dallas on the day Kennedy was shot, not an issue
here?
In his futuristic film Brazil (1985), directed by Terry Gilliam, terrorist
explosions go off in cafes for no apparent reason, very much like the
seemingly senseless terrorism that plagues occupied Iraq.
Is this Milchan's
influence?
"Anyone closely associated with Peres pretty well must be satanic," Barry
Chamish, a Canadian-Israeli wrote, "but Milchan produced a film that shows
he has insider information."
Chamish advises his readers to watch The
Devil's Advocate with Al Pacino to "understand the implication."
"Milchan runs his company like a family business. Heading up New Regency
Productions for him is his childhood friend David Matalon, whose parents
were best friends with Milchan's," Bardach wrote.
"Daughter Alexandra [Milchan-Lambert]
is vice president of production in Los Angeles."
Matalon has served as
president and CEO of New Regency Productions since 1995.
In 1986, Matalon, an Israeli co-founder of Tri-Star pictures, released a
film entitled Iron Eagle, in which the aerial combat scenes were filmed
entirely with the Israeli Air Force. The plot of this film is about how a
few teenagers are able to steal U.S. military codes, aircraft, and
information from under the noses of the military brass and run an entire
military operation in which they bomb Libya without the knowledge of the
military command.
This film gives some indication of the kind of projects
and ideas the Israeli military has collaborated on with their fellow
Israelis in Hollywood.
THE SECRETIVE MOGUL
"Averse to publicity and little known
outside Hollywood" is how Arnon Milchan's biography begins. "My idea of
a good profile is no profile," Milchan told Bardach.
Murdoch, Levin, and
Eisner have obviously respected the Israeli's wish, but why would a
Hollywood mogul not want to be known to the public?
"Arnon Milchan has
kept his secrets to himself," Bardach wrote.
Arnon Milchan with Brad Pitt
and Angelina Jolie
Indeed, very little is known about Milchan,
Israel's super weapons agent, except that he spends more time in Tel Aviv
and France than he does in his office on the 20th Century Fox lot in Los
Angeles, according to Bardach.
Now, why would a Hollywood movie producer spend
more time in Tel Aviv, where no movies are being made, than in Hollywood?
POLISH ZIONIST ROOTS
Milchan was born on December 6, 1944, on the Zionist settlement of Rehovot,
in what was then Palestine, according to his biography in Current Biography
(2000). Rehovot, one of the earliest Zionist settlements, was founded in
1890 by Polish and Russian Jews, one of whom was Milchan's paternal
grandfather.
Rehovot has a street and a neighborhood named "Milchen", no
doubt in memory of his grandfather.
"My family's been there for 500 years," Milchan told Bardach.
"My
grandfather was a very close friend of President [Chaim] Weizmann."
Oddly, Bardach does not provide the name of his grandfather who was "a very close
friend" of Israel's first president. Nor does she give the name of the
ancestors Milchan proudly claims have lived in Palestine for five hundred
years.
"Milchan's father was an enviable success story himself, having laid
the sprinklers that irrigated Israel," Bardach wrote. "Later, he would
handle some of Israel's lucrative military contracts, according to his son."
Bardach continues:
However, it was young Milchan who put the company on the map
internationally, after his father's sudden death. Following a spot of
schooling in London and Geneva, where he excelled in soccer and tennis,
Milchan dropped out and returned to Israel. Soon, he struck gold.
By marketing a newly discovered nutrient that
quadrupled citrus production, he brought his company stratospheric sales
throughout the world.
"This is a man who made his fortune by
screwing with nature," says screenwriter Shawn Slovo, who began her
career as Milchan's secretary in 1977. "He's the Israeli who made the
desert bloom. Amazing when you think about it. He could have retired at
the age of 22."
Instead, like a kid racing around the Monopoly
board, Milchan gobbled up another half dozen businesses--including
electronics, chemicals, aerospace and plastics.
Still in his early twenties,
he met the Shah of Iran and reportedly talked the wily Persian into dozens
of contracts, one to build much of Tehran's airport.
When one considers that Arnon Milchan, in his early twenties, was among the
founders of Israel's Labor Party in the 1960s with Shimon Peres, Moshe
Dayan, and Teddy Kolleck, then one can appreciate that his contracts in Iran
and his career in arms dealing and Hollywood have been done with the active
collaboration of the Mossad.
"I'M AN AGENT"
Milchan is a,
"go-between for American weapons
manufacturers and the Israeli government, thus playing a major role in
the strengthening of the Israeli military," according to Current
Biography (2000).
"Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and even up until the
Gulf War in 1991, Milchan was Israel's foremost weapons procurer,
brokering deals for such prized superweapons as the Hawk missile and the
famous Scud-foil of the Gulf War, the Patriot," Bardach wrote.
"At different times in his career, his Israeli company, Milchan
Brothers, has represented arms manufacturers such as Raytheon, North
American Rockwell, Beechcraft, Bell Helicopter and Magnavox. Or, as
Milchan downplays it, "there were a bunch of them."
Nevertheless, he
bristles at being called an arms dealer.
"I'm their rep in Israel," he
says emphatically. "I get a fee, a commission. I'm not even the buyer.
I'm an agent."
"What we do is send my people to the United States," Milchan told
Bardach, "so we know what these guys are talking about, and you go back
and say to the buyer, 'I think this guy has some interesting stuff.
Would you meet with him?' And then you arrange a meeting with the head
of the [Israeli] air force and the head of this and the head of that."
In 1992, Milchan was described by the Jerusalem
Post as being "among the handful of Hollywood moguls with the muscle and
money to single-handedly give the go-ahead for a new movie project.
The Mossad is undoubtedly the source of much of Milchan's "muscle and money."
Who pays Milchan's commissions? Whether the commission is paid by the
weapon's vendor or by the state of Israel, the money going to Milchan is
American money. He is paid either by the company or from the billions of
U.S. taxpayer dollars provided to Israel for weapons every year.
In this way, Milchan, Mossad's man in the
middle, has been greatly enriched by U.S. weapons sales to Israel.
"BIG STAR" TO RAYTHEON
In 1975, for example, Milchan reportedly received an improper $300,000
commission paid by a Raytheon subsidiary for the sale of Hawk missiles.
Raytheon makes the Patriot and Hawk missile
systems and key components of the Global Hawk. Of particular interest is
Raytheon's Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) which allow remote operators to
pilot the Global Hawk from "thousands of miles away." This is the kind of
technology that is thought to have been used in the terror attacks of 9-11.
Terry Gilliam told Bardach that he'll never forget a visit to the Paris Air
Show with Milchan during the filming of Baron Munchausen.
"It was wonderful to see how the whole arms
business worked," Gilliam said. "Arnon was very psyched about the video
games. He brought his son with him, who was then a teenager, to play the
games, which can replicate the destruction of the planet. He took me to
the Raytheon booth, and it was all showmanship. He was obviously a big
star to Raytheon."
"Growing up, I would read that he was an arms dealer; he was in the
Mossad, and he was a movie producer," his daughter Alexandra told
Bardach.
She is married to a Scott Lambert, an agent with
William Morris in Beverley Hills and graduate of American University in
Washington, D.C. (Lambert happens to share the same name of a former
Director of Manufacturing Systems at Raytheon.)
MODUS OPERANDI
When one looks at Milchan's career as an Israeli agent who bought media
outlets with dirty money one should consider that this may be the modus
operandi he has employed to gain influence and outlets in the U.S. media
market.
Money laundering could explain his ability to make huge deals and
control media networks - and his desire for secrecy.
"He's extremely powerful because he brings money to the table," journalist
Anita Busch wrote.
"He's unique in that way. He's got a credit line that's
astronomical, like, you know, almost a billion dollars." Terry Gilliam, the
director of Brazil, wondered where the money came from. "Arnon can be great,
but when it comes to money there's something - I don't know - bits just
don't seem to connect."
Charles McKeown, a film writer, had a hard time getting paid by the billion
dollar Israeli.
"You just never know whether he was telling the truth or
not," McKeown said.
"The kind of deals he was in, the level of finance and
the way he operated, seemed to me like a world upside down. I felt we were
dealing with a sort of dangerous, shady quality."
MONEY LAUNDERER
In 1975, the Israeli government headed by Yitzhak Rabin and Defense Minister
Shimon Peres recruited Milchan to launder money from South Africa.
Milchan,
"has admitted laundering some of the more than $100 million spent by the
South Africans during the 1970s in an attempt to improve the white
government's image abroad," according to the authors of The Iran-Contra
Connection.
Because both Israel and South Africa were ostracized in the
1970s,
"The money laundering was part of the two countries' plan to buy
newspapers and other media in various parts of the world," his biography
reads.
"The Rabin government recruited... Milchan to launder cash... to
purchase influential publications," Andrew and Leslie Cockburn wrote in
their book Dangerous Liaison.
THE MIDDLEMAN
Milchan told Bardach he was asked by,
"prominent Israelis if 'we can use your
companies to make deals to buy newspapers.' I said, 'Sure. It sounds like
fun.' Basically, I was used as a middleman."
A citizen of both Israel and
Monaco, he is said to control thirty companies in seventeen countries,
profiting in everything from film production to the weapons trade.
But, how does one man control thirty companies in seventeen countries?
Clearly there must be an entire team behind these businesses.
Milchan's team
could be called Team Mossad.
"I'll say it in my own words," Milchan told
Bardach. "I love Israel, and any way I can help Israel, I will. I'll do it
again and again. If you say I'm an arms dealer, that's your problem. In
Israel, there is practically no business that does not have something to do
with defense."
Milchan also funds Christian Zionist movements.
Milchan has reportedly
contributed significantly to the Christian Coalition, an organization
started by the Reverend Pat Robertson, a staunch supporter of Israel. He
also underwrites the Israeli Network which transmits Israeli television
programs to the United States and Canada via cable and satellite.
Milchan is also an owner of the Israeli television station known as Channel
10. The other owners are Ronald Lauder, who like Milchan owned about
twenty-five percent, and Josef (Yossi) Maiman, who owns fifty-one percent
and who has been with Channel 10 since it was founded in 2003. Rupert
Murdoch bought nine percent of Channel 10 stock from Milchan and Lauder in
2006. Maiman, a Mossad agent, owns and controls a great deal of the gas
fields of Turkmenistan.
One of the main goals of the occupation of
Afghanistan is to build a pipeline to bring the Israeli-owned gas of
Turkmenistan to India and China.
(Maiman and Lauder are both linked to the Mossad and 9-11. For more on
Maiman read my article, "The Great Game: The War For Caspian Oil And Gas."
Information about Lauder can be found in "Mossad -The Israeli Connection To
9-11")
SMUGGLING NUCLEAR
TRIGGERS
Milchan should have been busted in 1985 for smuggling triggers for nuclear
bombs, when a business associate,
Richard Kelly Smyth, was indicted by a
federal grand jury in Los Angeles on charges of smuggling 810 krytrons to
Israel.
Because krytrons are used as detonators or triggers for nuclear
weapons, their export is tightly regulated.
In 1973, Smyth started a company called Milco International, Inc., financed,
according to the Washington Post, by Milchan, hence its name. Up to eighty
percent of Milco's business was reportedly with Milchan and Israel. In 1980,
the federal indictment asserted, Smyth and Milco sent 610 krytrons to Israel
without the necessary licenses, plus another 200 in 1982.
The 1985 indictment identified the Israeli buyers of the nuclear triggers as
Heli Trading Ltd. and Milchan Brothers, two of Milchan's Israel-based
companies. Federal authorities told NBC News in 1993 that Milchan also
shared in the profits derived from the sales.
Announcement of the indictments came four days after the Israeli Defense
Ministry, reacting to news of the grand jury probe, admitted that it had the
devices, known as krytrons. The krytrons were shipped between 1979 and 1983
to an Israeli firm under contract to the government for defense work.
The
Israeli Ministry of Defense returned only 469 of the krytrons, and Smyth
vanished a week before he was to appear for trial.
PROTECTING ISRAEL
Robert C. Bonner, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, refused to comment on
questions about whether the Israeli government had been involved in the
illegal actions.
State Department spokesman Edward Djerejian said,
"I can
only note that the indictment does not mention any Israeli citizen."
Djerejian added that the United States,
"has expressed its serious concern to the
Israeli government about this alleged violation of U.S. law" and had
been assured that Israel will cooperate with the continuing U.S.
investigation "to the full extent permitted under Israeli law."
"Smyth's disappearance, and the unwillingness of Israeli officials to
cooperate with U.S. investigators on the case, left federal authorities
unable to proceed," Robert Windrem of NBC News reported in July 2001.
Although Milchan is not mentioned in the
indictment, a Milco employe, Gretel Siler, who identified herself as
corporate treasurer of Milco, told the Washington Post that Milchan had been
associated with Milco in various export transactions and had been involved
in purchasing the krytrons from the manufacturer, EG&G, of Wellesley, Mass.
Milchan denied being involved in the $60,000 krytron deal, but told "60
Minutes" (CBS) that he had allowed the Israeli government to use his
companies as conduits for trading with the United States.
"I'm not saying
I'm an innocent person - but in this specific case, I knew nothing about
it," Milchan told Frank Rose of Premiere magazine.
In any case, Milchan was
never charged in the case.
Robert Mainhardt, a nuclear scientist and former director of Milco, told "60
Minutes" that he had resigned after Milchan had asked him to obtain advanced
nuclear reactor designs and a supply of uranium hexachloride, which is used
in the enrichment of bomb-grade uranium. Mainhardt's fellow directors at
Milco, Arthur Biehl and Ivan Getting began to feel uneasy sometime in 1982,
the Washington Post reported.
The Washington Post did a series of articles
about this smuggling.
The most important excerpts are the following:
When they joined the board of directors of Milco International in 1980,
Biehl and Getting recalled, they thought the company's primary business was
developing aerospace software for U.S. military and space programs.
They had
been recruited by the company's owner,
Richard K. Smyth, while serving with
him on an influential panel that advises the U.S. Air Force on advanced
technologies, work that required them to have top-secret clearances.
But they soon realized that Smyth, a California-based computer expert, spent
most of his time trying to buy equipment with military applications,
including a uranium byproduct known as "green salt" that can be processed
into weapons-grade uranium, for the government of Israel.
Often, they said, the sales were made through an
Israeli middleman, Arnon Milchan, a flamboyant businessman who sold arms
before becoming a producer of such popular movies as the recent Brazil.
"I didn't have any evidence there was
anything improper," Biehl said. "I just thought it was a strange way to
do business... I wondered why the Israelis were paying fees to (Milco
and Milchan) when they could get the same equipment directly" using U.S.
foreign aid.
In late 1982, Biehl and Getting resigned from
Milco's board of directors, in part because of their misgivings about
Smyth's dealings with Milchan and Israel.
Asked why Israel didn't buy the
krytrons through its 200-member procurement
staff in New York, which buys military equipment with $1.8 billion in annual
U.S. aid, Yossi Gal, spokesman with the Israeli Embassy in Washington DC,
told the Post that Israel occasionally used "independent agents" to make
purchases.
Under U.S. laws, Smyth needed a munitions license from the State Department
to ship the krytrons overseas. If he had tried to obtain one, according to a
knowledgeable State Department source, he would have been turned down
because Israel has not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
Smyth's relations with Israel began in the early 1970s when he was working
for North American Rockwell as a chief engineer in its avionics division and
traveled to Israel to help set up a subsidiary. There, he met Milchan, who
was Rockwell's representative and "point man" with the Israeli government,
according to an associate of Smyth from that period.
In January 1973, Smyth founded Milco while still working at Rockwell. His
associate recalled Smyth once saying that Milchan provided money to start
Milco; this associate said he believes that the name Milco was derived from
Milchan.
At the time that Milco was founded, former U.S. intelligence officials said,
the Central Intelligence Agency knew that Israel was working to perfect a
solid-fuel tactical missile, known as the Jericho, that could carry nuclear
warheads. In late 1973, Smyth's associate recalled, he saw Milco order forms
for several barrels of a butyl compound used to bind explosive powders into
solid rocket fuel. Smyth said he was shipping the butyl to Milchan through
another company he owned in Houston, the associate recalled.
Smyth's next known contact with Israel occurred in 1975, about a year after
he left Rockwell to run Milco full time. On Oct. 30 of that year, Smyth
applied for a munitions license to ship 400 krytrons to Heli Trading Inc.,
Milchan's company in Israel.
The application, which is filed in court records in Los Angeles, said that
the "end user" would be Rehovot Instruments Ltd. and that the krytrons would
be used as "remotely located intrusion detectors."
Smyth filed the application after being told by an official from an unnamed
U.S. intelligence agency that a license was required, according to court
records.
Smyth met with the official and told him that,
"Arnon Milchan [had]
requested that a certain number of krytrons be shipped to Israel," according
to a letter filed by William Fahey, the prosecutor in the current case.
Internal Milco records, provided by former Smyth associates, show that the
company struggled financially from 1975 to 1980. It landed several small
contracts for less than $25,000 with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and the Air Force for studies on computer software for
avionics systems in advanced aircraft, the MX missile and a small ship
defense missile called the Patriot.
It was also in 1980, the federal indictment alleged, that Milco sent 610
krytrons to Israel in 11 shipments without obtaining the needed licenses.
Smyth bought them from EG&G in Salem, Mass., the sole producer of the
switches in the United States.
In mid-1981, Smyth listed several contracts with Heli Trading to acquire
training simulators for Hawk air defense missiles, a voice scrambler and
lasers. He also cited "probable" contracts for a computerized flight control
system for Israel's Lavi fighter plane, and thermal batteries and
gyroscopes.
James Russell, vice president of Incosym Inc., a maker of gyroscopes in
Thousand Oaks, Calif., said he sold Milco several $10,000 gyroscopes in that
period. Smyth told him the navigation aids would be used on Israeli navy
patrol boats. Milco also won a flight control contract for the Lavi in 1983,
according to a listing in Aviation Week magazine.
Smyth's world started to crumble in early 1983 after someone broke into
Milco's offices and took several thousand dollars worth of computer and
software equipment.
Because he was doing some classified U.S. government
work and feared some records of it might have been stolen, Smyth wrote a
lengthy report about the theft for the Pentagon and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, then-company attorney Brian R. Carter said.
Milco company records revealed that Milchan's companies had ordered large
quantities of missile-related equipment and materials between 1977 and 1982.
Among the nuclear items listed were the 810 krytrons, plus neutron
generators, high-speed oscilloscopes and high-voltage condensers, according
to a 1996 paper on Israel's Nuclear Weapon Capability by the Wisconsin
Project on Nuclear Arms Control.
In August 1985, U.S. Customs subpoenaed the financial records linking Smyth
and Milchan. The records were neither turned over nor found.
Smyth and his
wife disappeared just days before his scheduled trial, which almost
certainly would have involved Milchan.
"There were so many...indictments
that they probably decided just to get out," Mainhardt, who operates a
security business in Dublin, California, said. "If I had to make a guess,
I'd say they're in Israel."
"Let's assume that there's nothing that Israel and the United States do
separately," Milchan told Bardach. "Smyth, a U.S. fugitive for more than a
decade, was last seen in Herzliya Pituach, an affluent suburb of Tel Aviv,
where Milchan owns a home," Bardach wrote in 2000.
In July 2001, Smyth was
arrested in Malaga, Spain. Smyth pleaded guilty in December to one count of
violating the Arms Export Control Act and one count of making a false
statement to Customs agents. Prosecutors dropped twenty-eight other counts.
On April 29, 2002 Smyth was sentenced to forty months in federal prison and
fined $20,000 for illegally exporting to Israel the devices that are used as
triggers for nuclear weapons.
Smyth, 72, was immediately made eligible for
parole at his sentencing.
MILCHAN AND PERES
"In Israel, Milchan spends much of his time
with best friend Shimon Peres," Bardach wrote.
She continued, "Milchan's
political connections would prove to be the foundation of his future
empire. In addition to agriculture, there would be biotechnology,
advertising, aerospace, and the biggest jackpot of them all - arms."
Arnon Milchan is deeply
engaged in chemicals and helped build Israel's nuclear arsenal,
which was developed by his
good friend Shimon Peres.
What does he know about the
super-thermite that demolished the World Trade Center?
In 1953, at age thirty, Shimon Peres was
appointed by Israel's first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, to become
Director-General of the Ministry of Defense.
Within three years, Peres had laid the
foundation for Israel's nuclear weapon program, according to the Wisconsin
Project on Nuclear Arms Control. Peres started Israel's program to develop
nuclear power and nuclear weapons by convincing the French to help Israel
build a secret nuclear reactor beginning about 1957. He chose France as the
major supplier, arranged the sale of a nuclear reactor, and spent the next
decade overseeing the construction of the Dimona nuclear weapon production
complex.
Peres is the one who came up with Israel's most often repeated nuclear
declaration. At an April 1963 meeting in the White House, Peres responded to
President John F. Kennedy's questions about Israel's nuclear program by
saying:
"Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons to the
Middle East."
Two years later, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol
elevated Peres's words to Israel's official nuclear line.
